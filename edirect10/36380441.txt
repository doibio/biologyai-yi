AIMS: Metformin is the most widely used drug for the first-line treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but its use and schedule have been poorly 
investigated in elderly patients.
METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional, multicentric study on 
metformin in T2DM outpatients older than 65 years who were taking the drug for 
at least 6 months and referred to Italian Endocrinology and Diabetology 
Services. The primary endpoint was daily metformin dose, and secondary endpoints 
were the correlations between metformin dose and age, comorbidities, and 
concomitant use of other drugs. The study was open to all members of AME 
(Associazione Medici Endocrinologi).
RESULTS: Fifteen Italian centers recruited 751 consecutive participants (42.9% 
older than 75 years, 48.6% females). T2DM duration was 12.9 ± 9.7 years (longer 
than 10 years in 53.8%). Metformin had been used for 10.3 ± 6.8 years (longer 
than 10 years in 52.4%). Metformin dose was 1.6 ± 0.9 g/day (>1.5 g/day in 
63.4%). As compared to the youngest, participants older than 75 years did not 
differ for metformin daily dose or number of administrations. Metformin dose was 
significantly directly correlated to eGFR, diabetes duration, and metformin 
treatment duration.
CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the minimum daily effective dose of 
metformin was prescribed in more than half of older T2DM outpatients.
