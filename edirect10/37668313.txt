Affecting an estimated 88 million Americans, prediabetes increases the risk for 
developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and independently, cardiovascular 
disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Nevertheless, little is known 
about the use of metformin for diabetes prevention among patients in the 
Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the 
U.S. This is a retrospective observational cohort study of the proportion of 
Veterans with incident prediabetes who were prescribed metformin at the Veterans 
Health Administration from October 2010 to September 2019. Among 1,059,605 
Veterans with incident prediabetes, 12,009 (1.1%) were prescribed metformin 
during an average 3.4 years of observation after diagnosis. Metformin 
prescribing was marginally higher (1.6%) among those with body mass index (BMI) 
≥35 kg/m2, age <60 years, HbA1c≥6.0%, or those with a history of gestational 
diabetes, all subgroups at a higher risk for progression to T2DM. In a 
multivariable model, metformin was more likely to be prescribed for those with 
BMI ≥35 kg/m2 incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.6 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 
2.1-3.3], female sex IRR, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.8-3.3], HbA1c≥6% IRR, 1.93 [95% CI: 
1.5-2.4], age <60 years IRR, 1.7 [95% CI: 1.3-2.3], hypertriglyceridemia IRR, 
1.5 [95% CI: 1.2-1.9], hypertension IRR, 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2.1], Major Depressive 
Disorder IRR, 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2.0], or schizophrenia IRR, 2.1 [95% CI: 
1.2-3.8]. Over 20% of Veterans with prediabetes attended a comprehensive 
structured lifestyle modification clinic or program. Among Veterans with 
prediabetes, metformin was prescribed to 1.1% overall, a proportion that 
marginally increased to 1.6% in the subset of individuals at highest risk for 
progression to T2DM.
