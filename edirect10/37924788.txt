Metformin (Met) is the recommended first-line therapeutic drug for type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and exerts protective effects on β-cell damage. 
Ferroptosis, a new form of cell death, is associated with pancreatic islet 
injury in patients with T2DM. However, the protective effects of Met treatment 
against β-cell damage through ferroptosis modulation remain under-reported. This 
study investigated the in vivo effects of Met treatment on pancreatic β-cell 
ferroptosis using two different diabetic mouse models, namely, low-dose 
streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice and db/db 
mice. Met treatment significantly restored insulin release, reduced cell 
mortality, and decreased the overproduction of lipid-related reactive oxygen 
species in the islets of both STZ/HFD-induced diabetic mice and db/db mice. 
Administration of the Ras-selective lethal 3 injection significantly attenuated 
the antiferroptosis effects of Met. Mechanistically, Met treatment alleviated 
β-cell ferroptosis in T2DM, which was associated with the regulation of the 
GPX4/ACSL4 axis in the islets. In conclusion, our findings highlight the 
significance of ferroptosis in T2DM β-cell damage and provide novel insights 
into the protective effects of Met against islet β cells.
