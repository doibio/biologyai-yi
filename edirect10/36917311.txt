Age-related tendon disorders are closely linked with tendon stem/progenitor cell 
(TSPC) senescence. However, the underlying mechanisms of TSPC senescence and 
promising therapeutic strategies for rejuvenation of TSPC senescence remain 
unclear. In this study, the senescent state of TSPCs increased with age. It was 
also verified that the AMPK inhibition/mTOR activation is correlated with the 
senescent state of TSPCs. Furthermore, a low dose of metformin mitigated TSPC 
senescence and restored senescence-related functions, including proliferation, 
colony-forming ability, migration ability and tenogenic differentiation ability 
at the early stage of aging. The protective effects of metformin on TSPCs were 
regulated through the AMPK/mTOR axis. An in vivo study showed that metformin 
treatment postpones tendon aging and enhances AMPK phosphorylation but reduces 
mTOR phosphorylation in a natural aging rat model. Our study revealed new 
insight and mechanistic exploration of TSPC senescence and proposed a novel 
therapeutic treatment for age-related tendon disorders by targeting the 
AMPK/mTOR axis at the early stage of aging.
