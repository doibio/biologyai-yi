Ferroptosis, a new type of cell death, is associated with pancreatic β cell 
damage. However, the role of glucolipotoxicity in inducing β cell ferroptosis 
remains unclear. Metformin (Met), exenatide (Exe), and saxagliptin (Sax) are 
frequently used anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. However, their protective effects on 
β cells through ferroptosis modulation are not well-established. In this study, 
we observed significant ferroptosis in NIT-1 cells and primary mouse islets 
after exposure to high glucose and palmitate (HG/PA). Compared to Exe and Sax, 
Met significantly alleviated glucolipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β cell 
ferroptosis. Blocking the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) with 
Ras-selective lethal 3 or inhibiting its expression by small interfering RNA 
transfection significantly attenuated the anti-ferroptosis effects of Met. 
Mechanistically, Met alleviates HG/PA-induced β cell ferroptosis by regulating 
the GPX4/ACSL4 axis. Collectively, our findings highlight the significance of 
ferroptosis in pancreatic β cell glucolipotoxicity-induced injury and provide 
novel insights into the protective effects of Met on islet β cells.
