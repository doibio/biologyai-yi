BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects over 230 million people 
worldwide and is due to systemic atherosclerosis with etiology linked to chronic 
inflammation, hypertension, and smoking status. PAD is associated with walking 
impairment and mobility loss as well as a high prevalence of coronary and 
cerebrovascular disease. Intermittent claudication (IC) is the classic 
presenting symptom for PAD, although many patients are asymptomatic or have 
atypical presentations. Few effective medical therapies are available, while 
surgical and exercise therapies lack durability. Metformin, the most frequently 
prescribed oral medication for Type 2 diabetes, has salient anti-inflammatory 
and promitochondrial properties. We hypothesize that metformin will improve 
function, retard the progression of PAD, and improve systemic inflammation and 
mitochondrial function in non-diabetic patients with IC.
METHODS: 200 non-diabetic Veterans with IC will be randomized 1:1 to 180-day 
treatment with metformin extended release (1000 mg/day) or placebo to evaluate 
the effect of metformin on functional status, PAD progression, cardiovascular 
disease events, and systemic inflammation. The primary outcome is 180-day 
maximum walking distance on the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes 
include additional assessments of functional status (cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing, grip strength, Walking Impairment Questionnaires), health related 
quality of life (SF-36, VascuQoL), macro- and micro-vascular assessment of lower 
extremity blood flow (ankle brachial indices, pulse volume recording, EndoPAT), 
cardiovascular events (amputations, interventions, major adverse cardiac events, 
all-cause mortality), and measures of systemic inflammation. All outcomes will 
be assessed at baseline, 90 and 180 days of study drug exposure, and 180 days 
following cessation of study drug. We will evaluate the primary outcome with 
linear mixed-effects model analysis with covariate adjustment for baseline 6MWT, 
age, baseline ankle brachial indices, and smoking status following an intention 
to treat protocol.
DISCUSSION: MOBILE IC is uniquely suited to evaluate the use of metformin to 
improve both systematic inflammatory responses, cellular energetics, and 
functional outcomes in patients with PAD and IC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The prospective MOBILE IC trial was publicly registered 
(NCT05132439) November 24, 2021.
