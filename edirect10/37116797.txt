AIMS: To evaluate cognitive function in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) plus metformin 
or metformin alone and its association with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).
METHODS: Adults with T2D treated with GLP-1RA plus metformin (GLP-1RA + MET) or 
MET alone for at least 12 months were included. Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
test (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini Nutritional Assessment 
(MNA) and disability tests were administered. Circulating levels of seven EPCs 
phenotypes were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: A total of 154 elderly patients were included, of whom 78 in 
GLP-1RA + MET group and 76 in MET group. The GLP-1RA + MET group showed better 
cognitive function as indicated by a significant higher MoCA and MMSE scores, 
and higher levels of CD34+ CD133+, CD133+ KDR+, and CD34+ CD133+ KDR+ as 
compared with MET group. The number of CD34+ CD133+ KDR+ cells was an 
independent predictor of higher MoCA, MMSE and MNA scores.
CONCLUSIONS: People with T2D on GLP-1RA + MET treatment had better cognitive 
function and higher circulating levels of EPCs as compared with those on MET 
alone warranting further studies to understand the interrelationship between 
EPCs, GLP-RA treatment and cognitive health.
