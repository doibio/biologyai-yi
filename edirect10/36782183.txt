Young maturity-onset diabetes of the young type3(MODY3) as a special type of 
diabetes, the probability of diagnosis is low. This article reports on a case 
and reviews the relevant knowledge of the disease. We report an 
11-year-and-11-month-old girl whose grandmother died from diabetic complications 
while the rest of the families were non-diabetes. The proband was initially 
treated with insulin and metformin but the threatment proved inefficient. After 
an exome-targeted capture sequencing test, she was diagnosed with mature-onset 
diabetes of young type 3 (MODY3), and sulfonylureas make sense. The key to mody 
treatment is a correct and timely diagnosis, which contributes to helping 
patients overcome the problems of MODY3, especially for blood sugar control.
