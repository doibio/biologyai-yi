BACKGROUND: To subgroup Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) by K-means cluster analysis on clinical indicators, and to explore whether 
these subgroups represent different genetic features and calculated 
cardiovascular risks.
METHODS: The K-means clustering analysis was performed on two cohorts (n = 590 
and 392), both consisting of Chinese participants with newly diagnosed T2D. To 
assess genetic risks, multiple polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and mitochondrial 
DNA copy numbers (mtDNA-CN) were calculated for all participants. Furthermore, 
Framingham risk scores (FRS) of cardiovascular diseases in two cohorts were also 
calculated to verify the genetic risks.
RESULTS: Four clusters were identified including the mild age-related diabetes 
(MARD)(35.08%), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) (34.41%), severe autoimmune 
diabetes (SAID) 19.15%, and severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD) 11.36% 
subgroups in the MARCH (metformin, and acarbose in Chinese patients as the 
initial hypoglycemic treatment) cohort. There was a significant difference in 
PRS for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) across four subgroups in the MARCH cohort 
(p < 0.05). Compared with the SIDD and SIRD subgroups, patients in the MOD 
subgroup had a relatively lower PRS for CVD (p < 0.05) in the MARCH cohort. 
Females had a higher PRS compared to males, with no significant difference in 
FRS across the four clusters. The MOD subgroup had a significantly lower FRS 
which was consistent with the results of PRS. Similar results of PRS and FRS 
were also replicated in the CONFIDENCE (comparison of glycemic control and 
b-cell function among newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes treated with 
exenatide, insulin or pioglitazone) cohort.
CONCLUSION: There are different CVD risks in diabetic subgroups based on 
clinical and genetic evidence which may promote precision medicine.
