INTRODUCTION: The pharmacological management of erectile dysfunction (ED) in 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) is challenging as ED has a multifactorial etiology. The 
therapeutic potential of certain antihyperglycemic medications, such as 
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), has yet to be entirely 
studied in this setting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 108 
outpatients (median age 60 [56, 65] years) with T2D complaining of ED. Data were 
extracted from a database referring to patients with a 1-year follow-up on 
stable treatment with metformin alone (n = 45) and GLP-1RAs as an add-on to 
metformin (n = 63). Erectile function was assessed by the 5-item International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF5) at baseline and after 1 year of stable 
treatment . Values were compared between baseline (T0) and after 12 months of 
treatment (T12).
RESULTS: ED was confirmed in all at baseline, with an IIEF5 score range between 
13 and 19 points. After 12 months of treatment, glucose management was better in 
patients treated with GLP-1RAs plus metformin (HbA1c T0: 8.3 ± 0.2 vs. HbA1c 
T12: 7% ± 0.3%, p < 0.0001) than in those on metformin alone (HbA1c T0: 
7 ± 0.5 vs. HbA1c T12: 7.3 ± 0.4, p = 0.0007). GLP-1RAs plus metformin over 
metformin alone resulted in a significant weight loss (-5.82 ± 0.69 kg, 
p < 0.0001), reduction in waist circumference (-4.99 ± 0.6 cm, p < 0.0001), 
improvement in HbA1c (-0.56% ± 0.13%, p < 0.0001), and fasting plasma glucose 
(-25.54 ± 3.09 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), increase in total (+41.41 ± 6.11 ng/dL, 
p < 0.0001) and free (0.44 ± 0.09 ng/dL, p < 0.0001) testosterone levels, and 
gain in self-reported erectile function (IIEF5 score: +2.26 ± 0.26, p < 0.0001). 
The gain in the IIEF5 score was more relevant in patients with higher baseline 
IIEF5 score (estimated coefficient: 0.16 ± 0.08, p = 0.045), those having 
carotid stenosis (0.50 ± 0.24, p = 0.045), and showing weight loss from baseline 
(-0.08 ± 0.03, p = 0.013). The leading determinant of the final IIEF5 score was 
a 1-year treatment with GLP-1RAs plus metformin over metformin alone 
(2.74 ± 0.53, p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION: GLP-1RAs plus metformin over metformin alone improved ED regardless 
of different background characteristics of patients and partially irrespective 
of therapeutic targets achieved after 12 months of treatment. GLP-1RAs may have 
induced positive vasculature effects, resulting in improved erectile function in 
T2D.
CONCLUSION: Due to the retrospective nature of the study, a potential 
cause-effect relationship between the use of GLP-1RAs plus metformin over 
metformin alone in improving ED cannot be verified and confirmed. Randomized 
clinical trials are needed to provide evidence supporting the use of GLP-1RAs 
for treating ED in T2D.
