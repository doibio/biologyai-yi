Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia cause substantial pain in patients. 
Persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are prone to zoster infection and 
postherpetic neuralgia due to compromised immunity. We conducted this study to 
evaluate the risks of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia between metformin 
users and nonusers. Propensity score matching was utilized to select 47 472 
pairs of metformin users and nonusers from Taiwan's National Health Insurance 
Research Database between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2017. The Cox 
proportional hazards models were used for comparing the risks of herpes zoster 
and postherpetic neuralgia between metformin users and nonusers in patients with 
T2D. Compared with no-use of metformin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% 
confidence interval) for metformin use in herpes zoster and postherpetic 
neuralgia were 0.70 (0.66, 0.75) and 0.510 (0.39, 0.68), respectively. A higher 
cumulative dose of metformin had further lower risks of herpes zoster and 
postherpetic neuralgia than metformin no-use. This nationwide cohort study 
demonstrated that metformin use was associated with a significantly lower risk 
of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia than metformin no-use. Moreover, a 
higher cumulative dose of metformin was associated with further lower risks of 
these outcomes.
