Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) promote urinary glucose 
excretion and decrease plasma glucose levels independent of insulin. 
Canagliflozin (CANA) is an SGLT2i, which is widely prescribed, to reduce 
cardiovascular complications, and as a second-line therapy after metformin in 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the robust metabolic 
benefits, reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical fractures were 
reported for CANA-treated subjects. In collaboration with the National Institute 
on Aging (NIA)-sponsored Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we tested skeletal 
integrity of UM-HET3 mice fed control (137 mice) or CANA-containing diet 
(180 ppm, 156 mice) from 7 to 22 months of age. Micro-computed tomography 
(micro-CT) revealed that CANA treatment caused significant thinning of the femur 
mid-diaphyseal cortex in both male and female mice, did not affect trabecular 
bone architecture in the distal femur or the lumbar vertebra-5 in male mice, but 
was associated with thinning of the trabeculae at the distal femur in 
CANA-treated female mice. In male mice, CANA treatment is associated with 
significant reductions in cortical bone volumetric BMD by micro-CT, and by 
quantitative backscattered scanning electron microscopy. Raman 
microspectroscopy, taken at the femur mid-diaphyseal posterior cortex, showed 
significant reductions in the mineral/matrix ratio and an increased 
carbonate/phosphate ratio in CANA-treated male mice. These data were supported 
by thermogravimetric assay (TGA) showing significantly decreased mineral and 
increased carbonate content in CANA-treated male mice. Finally, the sintered 
remains of TGA were subjected to X-ray diffraction and showed significantly 
higher fraction of whitlockite, a calcium orthophosphate mineral, which has 
higher resorbability than hydroxyapatite. Overall, long-term CANA treatment 
compromised bone morphology and mineral composition of bones, which likely 
contribute to increased fracture risk seen with this drug.
