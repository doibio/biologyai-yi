BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative disease in 
joints among elderly patients. Senescence is deeply involved in the pathogenesis 
of osteoarthritis. Metformin is widely used as the first-line drug for Type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and has great potential for the treatment of other 
aging-related disorders, including OA. However, the role of metformin in OA is 
not fully elucidated. Therefore, our aim here was to investigate the effects of 
metformin on human chondrocytes.
METHODS: After metformin treatment, expression level of microRNA-34a and SIRT1 
in chondrocyte were detected with quantitative real-time PCR and 
immunofluorescence staining. Then, microRNA-34a mimic and small interfering RNA 
(siRNA) against SIRT1 (siRNA-SIRT1) were transfected into chondrocyte. 
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining was performed to 
assess chondrocyte senescence. Chondrocyte viability was illustrated with MTT 
and colony formation assays. Western blot was conducted to detect the expression 
of P16, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Collagen type II (COL2A1) 
and Aggrecan (ACAN).
RESULTS: We found that metformin treatment (1 mM) inhibited microRNA-34a while 
promoted SIRT1 expression in OA chondrocytes. Both miR-34a mimics and siRNA 
against SIRT1 inhibited SIRT1 expression in chondrocytes. SA-β-gal staining 
assay confirmed that metformin reduced SA-β-gal-positive rate of chondrocytes, 
while transfection with miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 reversed it. MTT assay and 
colony formation assay showed that metformin accelerated chondrocyte 
proliferation, while miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 weakened this effect. 
Furthermore, results from western blot demonstrated that metformin suppressed 
expression of senescence-associated protein P16, proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 
and catabolic gene MMP-13 while elevated expression of anabolic proteins such as 
Collagen type II and Aggrecan, which could be attenuated by transfection with 
miR-34a mimics.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest that metformin regulates chondrocyte 
senescence and proliferation through microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway, indicating it 
could be a novel strategy for OA treatment.
