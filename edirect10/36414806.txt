OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide versus polyethylene glycol loxenatide 
(PEG-loxenatide) in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin, 
from a Chinese healthcare systems perspective.
METHODS: The study applied the Swedish Institute of Health Economics Diabetes 
Cohort Model to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of 
once-weekly treatment of semaglutide at 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, versus 
PEG-loxenatide 0.2 mg, over a 40-year time horizon. Baseline cohort 
characteristics were collected from the SUSTAIN China trial. A network 
meta-analysis was conducted to obtain comparative treatment effects of 
once-weekly semaglutide and PEG-loxenatide based on two phase 3a clinical 
trials. Drug costs were sourced from the national bidding price of China. 
Outcomes were discounted at 5.0% per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the uncertainty of 
the base-case results.
RESULTS: When compared with PEG-loxenatide 0.2 mg, the projections of outcomes 
over the 40-year time horizon in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on 
metformin showed that treatment with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg 
were associated with improved discounted life expectancy by 0.08 and 0.12 years, 
and improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.16 and 0.22 
quality-adjusted life-years, respectively. Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg were achieved at lifetime cost savings of 19,309 China Yuan (CNY) and 
10,179 CNY, respectively. Sensitivity analyses verified the robustness of the 
results.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of Chinese healthcare systems, treatment with 
once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide represents a dominant option versus 
PEG-loxenatide for patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin.
