BACKGROUND: In multimorbid older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
the intensity of glucose-lowering medication (GLM) should be focused on 
attaining a suitable level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c ) while avoiding side 
effects. We aimed at identifying patients with overtreatment of T2DM as well as 
associated risk factors.
METHODS: In a secondary analysis of a multicenter study of multimorbid older 
patients, we evaluated HbA1c levels among patients with T2DM. Patients were aged 
≥70 years, with multimorbidity (≥3 chronic diagnoses) and polypharmacy (≥5 
chronic medications), enrolled in four university medical centers across Europe 
(Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, and Switzerland). We defined overtreatment as 
HbA1c  < 7.5% with ≥1 GLM other than metformin, as suggested by Choosing Wisely 
and used prevalence ratios (PRs) to evaluate risk factors of overtreatment in 
age- and sex-adjusted analyses.
RESULTS: Among the 564 patients with T2DM (median age 78 years, 39% women), 
mean ± standard deviation HbA1c was 7.2 ± 1.2%. Metformin (prevalence 51%) was 
the most frequently prescribed GLM and 199 (35%) patients were overtreated. The 
presence of severe renal impairment (PR 1.36, 1.21-1.53) and outpatient 
physician (other than general practitioner [GP], i.e. specialist) or emergency 
department visits (PR 1.22, 1.03-1.46 for 1-2 visits, and PR 1.35, 1.19-1.54 for 
≥3 visits versus no visits) were associated with overtreatment. These factors 
remained associated with overtreatment in multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multicountry study of multimorbid older patients with T2DM, 
more than one third were overtreated, highlighting the high prevalence of this 
problem. Careful balancing of benefits and risks in the choice of GLM may 
improve patient care, especially in the context of comorbidities such as severe 
renal impairment, and frequent non-GP healthcare contacts.
