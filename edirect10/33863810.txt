A female nursing home resident aged >70 years was admitted to the geriatric ward 
with de novo dysphagia 6 days after being discharged from the stroke unit. 
Metformin and ezetimibe had been added to her treatment regimen which already 
consisted of clopidogrel, atorvastatin, denosumab, calcium and vitamin D. At the 
geriatric ward a multidisciplinary team involving clinical pharmacists reviewed 
all treatments and appraised the time to benefit, ascertaining whether there was 
sufficient time left to experience therapeutic benefits. As a result, metformin, 
ezetimibe, denosumab, calcium and vitamin D were discontinued. This case report 
illustrates that both mortality risk assessment and evaluation of the time to 
benefit should be part of any medication review in frail older adults. 
Conversely, with limited available data pertaining to the concept of time to 
benefit, we advocate a broader awareness among pharmacists and a systematic 
assessment in future clinical trials.
