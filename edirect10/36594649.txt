AIMS: To present the results of an exploratory analysis of the BEYOND V study in 
which Chinese individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) received 
short-term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) during study run-in (prior to 
randomization) using a basal-first insulin titration method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was exclusively an exploratory analysis of the 7- to 
10-day run-in period of BEYOND V. Participants were hospitalized and had oral 
therapies withdrawn (except metformin). They received SIIT with once-daily 
insulin glargine and three-times-daily premeal insulin glulisine, titrated daily 
from a total starting dose of 0.4 to 0.5 units/kg/d, first adjusting insulin 
glargine to achieve fasting blood glucose (FBG) of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79 to 
119 mg/dL), then insulin glulisine to achieve pre-meal blood glucose of 4.4 to 
6.1 mmol/L. Key outcomes were the proportions of participants achieving FBG and 
2-hour postprandial blood glucose (PBG) targets.
RESULTS: Overall, 397 entered the run-in (mean 54.2 years, 235 males [59.2%]). 
At the end of SIIT, 374/396 participants (94.4%) had both FBG <7.0 mmol/L 
(<126 mg/dL) and 2-hour PBG <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL) and 282/396 (71.2%) had both 
FBG <6.1 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) and 2-hour PBG <10 mmol/L. The mean first time 
taken to achieve FBG <7 mmol/L, 2-hour PBG <10 mmol/L, and both, was 4.35, 3.88, 
and 5.04 days, respectively. Hypoglycaemia occurred in 99 participants (24.9%). 
There was no severe hypoglycaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Titrating basal insulin first is an effective and safe method of 
SIIT in individuals with T2D, rapidly achieving target glucose levels with a 
relatively low rate of hypoglycaemia.
