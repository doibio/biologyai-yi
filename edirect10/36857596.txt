BACKGROUND: Metformin and aspirin are commonly co-prescribed to people with 
diabetes. Metformin may prevent cancer, but in older people (over 70 years), 
aspirin has been found to increase cancer mortality. This study examined whether 
metformin reduces cancer mortality and incidence in older people with diabetes; 
it used randomization to 100 mg aspirin or placebo in the ASPirin in Reducing 
Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to quantify aspirin's impact on metformin 
users.
METHODS: Analysis included community-dwelling ASPREE participants (aged ≥70 
years, or ≥65 years for members of US minority populations) with diabetes. 
Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level greater than 125 mg/dL, 
self-report of diabetes, or antidiabetic medication use. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were used to analyze the association of metformin and 
a metformin-aspirin interaction with cancer incidence and mortality, with 
adjustment for confounders.
RESULTS: Of 2045 participants with diabetes at enrollment, 965 were concurrently 
using metformin. Metformin was associated with a reduced cancer incidence risk 
(adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51 to 
0.90), but no conclusive benefit for cancer mortality (adjusted HR = 0.72, 95% 
CI = 0.43 to 1.19). Metformin users randomized to aspirin had greater risk of 
cancer mortality compared with placebo (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.18 to 5.43), but 
no effect was seen for cancer incidence (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.64). The 
possible effect modification of aspirin on cancer mortality, however, was not 
statistically significant (interaction P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling older adults with diabetes, metformin use was 
associated with reduced cancer incidence. Increased cancer mortality risk in 
metformin users randomized to aspirin warrants further investigation.
