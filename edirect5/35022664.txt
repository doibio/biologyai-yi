AIMS: In heart failure (HF), pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) produces 
pulmonary hypertension (PH) with remodeling of pulmonary veins (PV) and arteries 
(PA). In a porcine PVH model, we performed proteomic-based bioinformatics to 
investigate unique pathophysiologic mechanisms mediating PA and PV remodeling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Large PV were banded (PVH, n = 10) or not (Sham, n = 9) in 
piglets. At sacrifice, PV and PA were perfusion labelled for vessel-specific 
histology and proteomics. The PA and PV were separately sampled with 
laser-capture micro-dissection for mass spectrometry. Pulmonary vascular 
resistance [Wood Units; 8.6 (95% confidence interval: 6.3, 12.3) vs. 2.0 (1.7, 
2.3)] and PA [19.9 (standard error of mean, 1.1) vs. 10.3 (1.1)] and PV [14.2 
(1.2) vs. 7.6 (1.1)] wall thickness/external diameter (%) were increased in PVH 
(P < 0.05 for all). Similar numbers of proteins were identified in PA (2093) and 
PV (2085) with 94% overlap, but biological processes differed. There were more 
differentially expressed proteins (287 vs. 161), altered canonical pathways (17 
vs. 3), and predicted upstream regulators (PUSR; 22 vs. 6) in PV than PA. In PA 
and PV, bioinformatics indicated activation of the integrated stress response 
and mammalian target of rapamycin signalling with dysregulated growth. In PV, 
there was also activation of Rho/Rho-kinase signalling with decreased actin 
cytoskeletal signalling and altered tight and adherens junctions, ephrin B, and 
caveolae-mediated endocytosis signalling; all indicating disrupted endothelial 
barrier function. Indeed, protein biomarkers and the top PUSR in PV 
(transforming growth factor-beta) suggested endothelial to mesenchymal 
transition in PV. Findings were similar in human autopsy specimens.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide new therapeutic targets to oppose pulmonary 
vascular remodeling in HF-related PH.
