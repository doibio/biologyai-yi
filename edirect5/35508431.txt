OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the trend of blood sirolimus 
concentrations in neonates following ductal stenting. The long-term outcomes and 
incidence of infections were also evaluated.
METHODS: Prospective open-label observational study in a tertiary referral 
centre over a 1-year period. Serum sirolimus levels were estimated at 1 hour and 
24hrs post-stent insertion followed by 7 days in neonates who underwent ductal 
stenting. The trend in sirolimus levels, incidence of infections, complications 
and outcomes following ductal stenting were studied.
RESULTS: Seven neonates with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation underwent 
ductal stenting at median age of 8.5 days and weight of 2.83kg. The average 
stent size was 3.5±0.4 mm, and average stent length was 16.3±5.1 mm. The mean 
sirolimus concentrations at 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days were 41.3±6.9ng/ml, 
15.4±7.1ng/ml and 3.1±0.85ng/ml respectively. Levels fell below therapeutic 
range for all patients by 7 days. Three patients had sepsis or necrotising 
enterocolitis, but responded well to antibiotics; 1 patient had aspiration 
related sudden death. There were no further events at a mean follow-up of 207 
days, and 4 patients underwent elective surgery at 238 ± 81 days after ductal 
stenting.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates applicability of drug-eluting stents for 
ductal stenting in newborns. Drug-eluting stents with abluminal drug delivery 
are associated with high sirolimus levels in initial hours but rapidly taper to 
negligible levels within a week of implantation. Neonates with high 
pre-procedure likelihood of infection developed sepsis but responded well to 
conservative management. The patency of drug-eluting ductal stents is preserved 
over long-term follow-up.
