BACKGROUND: Postzygotic activating PIK3CA variants cause several phenotypes 
within the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). Variant strength, 
mosaicism level, specific tissue involvement and overlapping disorders are 
responsible for disease heterogeneity. We explored these factors in 150 novel 
patients and in an expanded cohort of 1007 PIK3CA-mutated patients, analysing 
our new data with previous literature to give a comprehensive picture.
METHODS: We performed ultradeep targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on DNA 
from skin biopsy, buccal swab or blood using a panel including 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway genes 
and GNAQ, GNA11, RASA1 and TEK. Additionally, 914 patients previously reported 
were systematically reviewed.
RESULTS: 93 of our 150 patients had PIK3CA pathogenetic variants. The merged 
PROS cohort showed that PIK3CA variants span thorough all gene domains, some 
were exclusively associated with specific PROS phenotypes: weakly activating 
variants were associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and 
strongly activating variants with extra-CNS phenotypes. Among the 57 with a 
wild-type PIK3CA allele, 11 patients with overgrowth and vascular malformations 
overlapping PROS had variants in GNAQ, GNA11, RASA1 or TEK.
CONCLUSION: We confirm that (1) molecular diagnostic yield increases when 
multiple tissues are tested and by enriching NGS panels with genes of 
overlapping 'vascular' phenotypes; (2) strongly activating PIK3CA variants are 
found in affected tissue, rarely in blood: conversely, weakly activating 
mutations more common in blood; (3) weakly activating variants correlate with 
CNS involvement, strong variants are more common in cases without; (4) patients 
with vascular malformations overlapping those of PROS can harbour variants in 
genes other than PIK3CA.
