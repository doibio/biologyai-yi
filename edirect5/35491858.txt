Following acute kidney injury (AKI), renal tubular cells may stimulate 
fibroblasts in a paracrine fashion leading to interstitial fibrosis, but the 
paracrine factors and their regulation under this condition remain elusive. Here 
we identify a macroautophagy/autophagy-dependent FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 
2) production in tubular cells. Upon induction, FGF2 acts as a key paracrine 
factor to activate fibroblasts for renal fibrosis. After ischemic AKI in mice, 
autophagy activation persisted for weeks in renal tubular cells. In inducible, 
renal tubule-specific atg7 (autophagy related 7) knockout (iRT-atg7-KO) mice, 
autophagy deficiency induced after AKI suppressed the pro-fibrotic phenotype in 
tubular cells and reduced fibrosis. Among the major cytokines, tubular autophagy 
deficiency in iRT-atg7-KO mice specifically diminished FGF2. Autophagy 
inhibition also attenuated FGF2 expression in TGFB1/TGF-β1 (transforming growth 
factor, beta 1)-treated renal tubular cells. Consistent with a paracrine action, 
the culture medium of TGFB1-treated tubular cells stimulated renal fibroblasts, 
and this effect was suppressed by FGF2 neutralizing antibody and also by fgf2- 
or atg7-deletion in tubular cells. In human, compared with non-AKI, the renal 
biopsies from post-AKI patients had higher levels of autophagy and FGF2 in 
tubular cells, which showed significant correlations with renal fibrosis. These 
results indicate that persistent autophagy after AKI induces pro-fibrotic 
phenotype transformation in tubular cells leading to the expression and 
secretion of FGF2, which activates fibroblasts for renal fibrosis during 
maladaptive kidney repair.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladnine; ACTA2/α-SMA:
