Although the neurotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) has been evaluated in 
animal and nerve cell culture models, these models cannot accurately mimic human 
brains. Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids based on human-induced 
pluripotent stem cells have been developed to study the human brains, but this 
model has rarely been used to evaluate NP neurotoxicity. We used 3D brain 
organoids that express cortical layer proteins to investigate the mechanisms of 
ZnO NP-induced neurotoxicity. Cytotoxicity caused by high levels of ZnO NPs 
(64 μg/mL) correlated with high intracellular Zn ion levels but not superoxide 
levels. Exposure to a non-cytotoxic concentration of ZnO NPs (16 μg/mL) 
increased the autophagy-marker proteins LC3B-II/I but decreased p62 
accumulation, whereas a cytotoxic concentration of ZnO NPs (64 μg/mL) decreased 
LC3B-II/I proteins but did not affect p62 accumulation. Fluorescence 
micro-optical sectioning tomography revealed that 64 μg/mL ZnO NPs led to 
decreases in LC3B proteins that were more obvious at the outer layers of the 
organoids, which were directly exposed to the ZnO NPs. In addition to reducing 
LC3B proteins in the outer layers, ZnO NPs increased the number of micronuclei 
in the outer layers but not the inner layers (where LC3B proteins were still 
expressed). Adding the autophagy flux inhibitor bafilomycin A1 to ZnO NPs 
increased cytotoxicity and intracellular Zn ion levels, but adding the autophagy 
inducer rapamycin only slightly decreased cellular Zn ion levels. We conclude 
that high concentrations of ZnO NPs are cytotoxic to 3D brain organoids via 
defective autophagy and intracellular accumulation of Zn ions.
