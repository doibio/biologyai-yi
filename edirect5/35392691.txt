PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal arterial diseases remains 
controversial. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials aiming to investigate the efficacy differences between 
paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents, covered stents, drug-coated balloons, 
bare metal stents, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
METHOD: MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid, and other relevant online material were searched 
up to October 21, 2020. Primary endpoints were primary patency and target lesion 
revascularization at 6, 12, and more than 24 months.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight eligible trials included 6026 patients. In terms of 
primary patency, drug eluting stents were ranked as the most effective treatment 
based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values at 6 (80.6), 12 
(78.4), and more than 24 months (96.5) of follow-ups. In terms of target lesion 
revascularization, drug eluting stents were ranked as the most effective 
treatment based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values at 6 
(90.3), 12 (71.3), and more than 24 months (82.1) of follow-ups. Covered stents 
and bare metal stents had higher ranks in target lesion revascularization than 
those in primary patency. Sirolimus stents had a higher rank than paclitaxel 
stents.
CONCLUSION: Drug eluting stents showed encouraging results in primary patency 
rates and freedom from target lesion revascularization at all phases of 
follow-up for femoropopliteal arterial diseases. Sirolimus stents appear to be 
more effective in femoropopliteal segment than paclitaxel stent.
