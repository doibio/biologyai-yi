BACKGROUND: Provisional stenting is preferred for bifurcation lesion; however, 
certain anatomical substrate does require two stents as a part of dedicated 
stent technique. Here, the present study evaluated outcomes of ultra-thin (60 
µm) Supra family sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) (Sahajanand Medical Technologies 
Limited, Surat, India) for dedicated bifurcation lesions using nano-crush 
technique at 12 months angiographic follow-up.
METHODS: This was prospective, single-center observational study which enrolled 
patients with de novo bifurcation lesion and underwent angioplasty with Supra 
family SES using nano-crush technique at a tertiary care center in India, 
between March-2017 and February-2019. Primary endpoint at 12 months was target 
lesion failure (TLF), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial 
infarction (TV-MI), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization 
(CD-TLR). Secondary endpoints included patient-oriented composite endpoint 
(POCE), all-cause death, any revascularization, clinically driven target vessel 
revascularization, stent thrombosis, periprocedural and spontaneous MI, and 
device failure.
RESULTS: The study enrolled total 63 patients with a mean age of 62.5±4.9 years 
and had male dominance (89%). Left main (LM) bifurcation and non-LM bifurcation 
were observed in 21 (33%) and 42 (67%) patients, respectively. Total 50 (80%) 
patients had Medina class- 1,1,1. At 12 months, TLF occurred in 4 (6%) patients 
which included one cardiac death (1.5%), two (3.0%) TV-MI, and one CD-TLR 
(1.5%). POCE was observed in 6 (9.6%) patients. Stent failure was seen in 2 
(3.1%) patient and one patient (1.5%) developed late stent thrombosis. Twelve 
months angiographic follow-up indicated intact stent patency in all other 
patients. On multivariate analysis, LM bifurcation, renal dysfunction, LM 
bifurcation with renal dysfunction, ejection fraction (<35%) and calcified 
lesion were found as predictors of TLF.
CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated stenting with ultra-thin Supra family SES for complex 
bifurcation lesion using nano-crush technique reported acceptable clinical 
outcomes among real-world patients and can be performed safely with ease without 
any procedural complications.
