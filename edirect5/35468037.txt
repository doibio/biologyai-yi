Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment 
in the aging population with limited understanding of its pathogenesis and a 
lack of effective treatment. The progression of AMD is initially characterized 
by atrophic alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium, as well as the 
formation of lysosomal lipofuscin and extracellular drusen deposits. Damage 
caused by chronic oxidative stress, protein aggregation and inflammatory 
processes may lead to geographic atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization and 
fibrosis. The role of macroautophagy/autophagy in AMD pathology is steadily 
emerging. This review describes selective and secretory autophagy and their role 
in drusen biogenesis, senescence-associated secretory phenotype, inflammation 
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the pathogenesis of AMD.Abbreviations:
