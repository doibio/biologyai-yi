PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of patients with 
peripheral artery disease (PAD) treated with Absorb everolimus-eluting 
bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) by analyzing all the published studies on 
the clinical characteristics of patients with PAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched 
for relevant studies. Efficacy, safety, and basic characteristics were analyzed.
RESULTS: Four studies were included in meta-analysis, including a total number 
of 155 patients with PAD. The pooled overall primary patency, freedom from 
target lesion revascularization (TLR), symptom resolution, and wound healing 
were 90%, 96%, 94%, and 86%, respectively. The pooled perioperative complication 
and all-cause mortality were 4% and 9%, respectively. Preoperative total 
occlusion was detected in 43 of 192 lesions (22%). The mean lesion length was 
27.26 mm. In terms of comorbidities, the pooled percentage of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney 
disease history, and smoking were 65%, 74%, 49%, 43%, 20%, and 57%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Among these studies, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes 
mellitus were the most common comorbidities in patients with PAD. The Absorb 
everolimus-eluting BVS was safe and showed the favorable clinical outcomes in 
both patency and TLR, especially in infrapopliteal disease with heavy 
calcification. The conclusions of this meta-analysis still needed to be verified 
by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and 
larger sample size.
