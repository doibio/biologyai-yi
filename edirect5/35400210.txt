STUDY DESIGN: Basic Research.
OBJECTIVE: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is caused by the cartilage 
endplate (CEP). Cartilage endplate stem cell (CESC) is involved in the recovery 
of CEP degeneration. Tension load (TL) contributes a lot to the initiation and 
progression of IVDD. This study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanism of 
the Mitogen-activated protein kinases/Mammalian target of rapamycin (MAPK/mTOR) 
pathway during TL-induced CESC degeneration.
METHODS: CESCs were isolated from New Zealand big-eared white female rabbits 
(6 months old). FX-4000T cell stress loading system was applied to establish a 
TL-induced degeneration model of CESCs. Western blotting was used to detect the 
level of mTOR pathway-related proteins and autophagy markers LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin-1, 
and p62 in degenerative CESCs. The expression of MAPK pathway-related proteins 
JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in degenerated CESCs was 
inhibited by cell transfection to explore whether JNK and ERK play a regulatory 
role in TL-induced autophagy in CESCs.
RESULTS: In the CESC degeneration model, the mTOR pathway was activated. After 
inhibition of mTOR, the autophagy level of CESCs was increased, and the 
degeneration of CESCs was alleviated. The MAPK pathway was also activated in the 
CESC degeneration model. Inhibition of JNK expression may alleviate TL-induced 
CEP degeneration by inhibiting Raptor phosphorylation and activating autophagy. 
Inhibition of ERK expression may alleviate TL-induced CEP degeneration by 
inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation and activating autophagy.
CONCLUSION: Inhibition of JNK and ERK in the MAPK signaling family alleviated 
TL-induced CESC degeneration by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Raptor and 
mTOR in the mTOR pathway.
