BACKGROUND: Few studies compared paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) versus 
sirolimus-coated balloon (SCB) in the treatment of drug-eluting stent (DES) 
instent restenosis (ISR).
METHODS: Between November 5, 2009, and October 14, 2020, in our center 212 
patients with first DES-ISR were treated with PCB (Restore®; Cardionovum GmbH, 
Bonn, Germany), whereas 230 patients were treated with SCB (Devoir®; MINVASYS 
SAS, Gennevilliers, France). Following a propensity matching, 186 patients were 
included into PCB group (PCB group), and in the SCB group (SCB group). The 
primary purpose of the study was the 1-year target lesion failure (TLF) rate, 
including cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and 
repeated target lesion or target vessel revascularization.
RESULTS: Procedural success occurred in all cases. Fully optimal predilation 
(that is, balloon-to-stent ratio >0.91, time of DCB inflation >60 sec, and 
residual percent diameter stenosis after lesion preparation <20%) was observed 
more often in the SCB group (126 [68%] patients versus 106 [57%] patients; 
P=0.042). One-year TLF occurred in 29 (15.5%) patients in the SCB group and in 
32 (17%) patients in the PCB group (OR=1.12 [0.65-1.95]; P=0.78). By logistic 
Cox regression analysis fully optimal predilation (OR=0.06; 95% CI: 0.01-0.21; 
P<0.001) but not DCB type (OR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.41-1.31; P=0.29) was independent 
predictor of 1-year TLF.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that 1-year TLF is not statistically and 
clinically different in patients with DES ISR treated with a PCB and a SCB.
