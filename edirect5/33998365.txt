BACKGROUND: Glutamate-induced neuronal cell death plays a key role in 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Some 
recent studies reported the potential immunomodulatory and neuroprotective 
properties of inhibitors of serine-threonine kinase, mTOR (mammalian target of 
rapamycin). However, no study was conducted about the neuroprotective potential 
of everolimus (EVR), a selective and potent mTOR inhibitor. Therefore, this 
study was planned to investigate whether EVR has protective effects against 
glutamate-induced toxicity in PC12 cells, which are used as model for neurons 
injury, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: PC12 cells were concurrently treated with glutamate (8 mM) and EVR 
(0-40 nM) for 24 h. Then, the cells viability, apoptosis rate, and 
apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, bax and bcl-2) were measured using MTT, 
annexin V/PI and immunoblotting assays.
RESULTS: Analyzing the protective effect of different concentrations of EVR 
(0-40 nM) against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity revealed a significant increase 
in cell viability in co-treatment regimen (p < 0.01). Also, EVR (40 nM) 
significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis through 
depressing the elevation of bax/bcl-2 ratio and expression of cleaved caspase-3, 
concentration depend.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated, for the first time, that EVR could protect 
against glutamate-mediated PC12 cell death via inhibiting apoptosis.
