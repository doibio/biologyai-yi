PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling pathways have been used for metastatic clear 
cell renal cell carcinoma (mCCRCC), but resistance to the drug develops in most 
patients. We aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of the TKI resistance 
with regard to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and to investigate signaling 
pathway associated with the resistant mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the mechanism of resistance, 10 mCCRCC 
patients from whom tumor tissues were harvested at both the pretreatment and the 
TKI-resistant post-treatment period were included as the discovery cohort, and 
their global gene expression profiles were compared. A TKI-resistant renal 
cancer cell line was established by long-term treatment with sunitinib.
RESULTS: Among differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, increased 
PD-L1 expression in post-treatment tissues was noted in four patients. Pathway 
analysis showed that PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The TKI-resistant renal 
cancer cells showed increased expression of PD-L1 and mTOR signaling proteins 
and demonstrated aggressive tumoral behaviour. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors 
down-regulated PD-L1 expression and suppressed aggressive tumoral behaviour, 
which was reversed with stimulation of the mTOR pathway.
CONCLUSION: These results showed that PD-L1 expression may be increased in a 
subset of VEGFR-TKI-resistant mCCRCC patients via the mTOR pathway.
