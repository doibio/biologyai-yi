BACKGROUND: Aim of this pilot clinical study was to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of the Selution Sustained Limus Release (SLR)™ sirolimus-eluting 
balloon (SEB) for improving failing arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) patency in 
Asian haemodialysis patients.
METHODS: Prospective single-centre, multi-investigator, non-consecutive, 
non-blinded single arm trial. Forty end-stage renal failure Asian patients with 
a dysfunctional AVF underwent SEB angioplasty between May and November 2020. All 
stenotic lesions were prepared with high pressure non-compliant balloon 
angioplasty prior to SEB angioplasty. Endpoints of interest included target 
lesion primary patency and circuit access patency and safety through 30 days. 
All patients received dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 month and were followed up 
with Duplex ultrasound at 6 months.
RESULTS: There was one subject dropout so final n = 39 patients (mean age 
65.0 ± 11.9; males = 26 (66.7%)) and n = 43 target lesions treated. Main 
indication for intervention was dropping access flow (24/39; 61.5%) and most 
common target lesion was in the juxta-anastomosis (24/43; 54.5%). There was 100% 
technical and procedural success. There were no adverse events related to the 
SEB. Target lesion primary patency rates at 3 and 6 months were 39/41 (95.1%) 
and 28/39 (71.8%) respectively. Access circuit patency rates at 3 and 6 months 
were 35/37 (94.6%) and 22/35 (62.9%) respectively. There were 3 (7.7%) deaths 
all attributable to patients' underlying co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Fistuloplasty using the novel Selution SLR™ SEB for dysfunctional 
AVF circuits seems a safe and effective modality in Asian haemodialysis patients 
at 6 months but larger randomised controlled studies are required now to 
determine its true efficacy against plain balloon angioplasty.
