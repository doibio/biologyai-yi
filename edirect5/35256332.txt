INTRODUCTION: The Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare, often chronic, relapsing and 
treatment-refractory hematological disorder. We described the clinical features, 
diagnostic workup, treatment and outcome in patients with ES.
METHOD: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients aged < 18 years 
with ES admitted to a tertiary center in Brazil from 2001 to 2021. The analysis 
of the data was primarily descriptive, using median, interquartile range and 
categorical variables presented in absolute frequencies.
MAIN RESULTS: Twenty patients (12 female, 8 male) were evaluated in this study. 
The median age at the initial cytopenia was 4.98 years (1.30-12.57). The ES was 
secondary in nine cases (45%), of which six patients (30%) showed autoimmune 
disease (AID) or primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and one presented a 
spontaneous recovery. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin were first-line 
therapy in 19 cases. Twelve patients (63%) required second-line treatments 
(rituximab, cyclosporine, splenectomy, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, 
mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and eltrombopag). The median follow-up 
period was 2.41 years (1.4 -7.52). One patient (5%) died of underlying 
neuroblastoma, one case (5%) was lost to follow-up and four patients (20%) 
received a medical discharge. The median age for the 14 remaining cases was 12.6 
years. Twelve patients (85.7%) were in complete response (CR) with no therapies. 
Two patients (14.3%) were in CR with chronic therapy.
CONCLUSION: As ES may be a symptom of AID and PID, a thorough rheumatological, 
immunologic and genetic workup and a careful follow-up are essential. The 
second-line treatment remains a dilemma. Further prospective studies are needed 
to address the optimal therapeutic combinations, morbidity and mortality in this 
disorder.
