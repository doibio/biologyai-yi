Diaphorina citri is an important vector of Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. 
After feeding on young host plant shoots, the population of D. citri can 
increase significantly. Females also only lay eggs on young shoots. However, 
there are few studies on the mechanism of this phenomenon. Exogenous nutrient 
signals can affect the insulin signaling system of D. citri after feeding on 
young shoots. In this study, the expression of upstream factors DcILP1, DcILP2, 
and DcIR in the insulin signaling system of D. citri was upregulated after 
feeding on young shoots. After being silenced by RNA interference technology, 
the results showed that the number of oviposited eggs of D. citri was 
significantly decreased and the ovarian development was inhibited with severe 
vacuolation. In addition, detection using quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the upstream regulatory gene 
DcRheb of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway and the downstream 
reproduction-related DcVg gene were also significantly downregulated. These 
results suggest that feeding upon young shoots may upregulate the expression 
levels of upstream factors DcILP1, DcILP2, and DcIR in the insulin signaling 
system. The signal will be through upregulating the expression of DcRheb, an 
upstream gene of the TOR signaling pathway. This in turn influences yolk 
metabolism, which eventually causes the ovaries of female D. citri to mature and 
therefore initiate oviposition behavior.
