Atg11 is an adaptor protein required for the induction of selective autophagy 
via receptor binding. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by 
which it regulates selective autophagy remains incomplete. Here, we show that 
Atg11 is phosphorylated by Atg1. Rapamycin treatment or starvation conditions 
induced slower electrophoretic mobility of Atg11 in an Atg1 kinase 
activity-dependent manner. Through in vitro kinase assays combined with 
mutagenesis, we determined that Atg1 phosphorylates S949, S1057, and S1064 
residues in CC4 domain of Atg11. Replacing the three residues with alanine 
suppressed the cleavage of selective autophagy substrates for the 
cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, mitophagy, reticulophagy, and 
pexophagy. The Atg11 mutant was defective in binding to related selective 
autophagy receptors. These results demonstrate a previously unknown function of 
Atg1 in regulation of selective autophagy via Atg11 
phosphorylation.Abbreviations: AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG:
