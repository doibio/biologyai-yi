BACKGROUND: It is important to determine the best drug-eluting stent (DES) for 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with renal impairment. In this 
studythe outcomes of everolimus-eluting stents (EESs), zotarolimus-eluting 
stents (ZESs) and biolimus-eluting stents (BESs) were evaluated.
METHODS: From the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction-National Institutes of 
Health registry, a total of 1,470 AMI patients with renal impairment undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were enrolled (816 with EES, 345 with 
ZES, and 309 with BES). Renal impairment was defined as creatinine clearance < 
60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault method. Major adverse cardiac 
and cerebrovascular events were determined as the composite of all-cause death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident, any 
revascularization, rehospitalization and stent thrombosis. All clinical outcomes 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the patients revealed no significant 
difference between the three groups, except for Killip classification > 2, 
beta-blockers, lesion type, vascular approach, staged PCI, left main coronary 
artery (LMCA) complex lesions, LMCA PCI, and the number and length of implanted 
stents. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, similar clinical outcomes were derived 
from the unadjusted data between the three DES groups. However, after the 
inverse probability of treatment weighting, a statistically significant 
difference was found in non-fatal MI, which implied a higher incidence of 
non-fatal MI in the ZES group than in the other two DES groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In AMI patients with renal impairment, there was no significant 
difference between the three stent groups in terms of long-term clinical 
outcomes, except for non-fatal MI.
