OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of and potential contributing factors to 
temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) caused by oestrogen deficiency 
with a persistent high bite force.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TMJOA model was generated by subjecting 6-week-old 
female rats to ovariectomy (OVX) and feeding them a hard feed. The rats 
(n = 12/group) were divided into sham (control); OVX; OVX+hard feed (HF); 
OVX+hard feed+local-joint injection of 17β-oestradiol (an oestrogen) (E2); and 
OVX+hard feed+local-joint injection of rapamycin (an autophagy activator) 
(RAPA)groups. Condyles were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and Safranin O Fast 
Green. The expression of Beclin 1, LC3 and p-mTOR in condylar cartilages was 
analysed.
RESULTS: Tissue staining revealed thinner condylar cartilage, varying numbers or 
fewer hypertrophic chondrocytes, and lower proteoglycan content in the cartilage 
matrix of the OVX group. These characteristics were more pronounced in the HF 
group, but were significantly recovered in the E2 and RAPA groups. 
Immunohistochemical staining revealed significantly lower autophagic flux in 
OVX/HF groups and a higher one in E2/RAPA groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A persistent high bite force could aggravate TMJOA induced by 
oestrogen deficiency, and the application of oestrogen or rapamycin could delay 
its progression. Additionally, autophagy may play a role in the development of 
TMJOA.
