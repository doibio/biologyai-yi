valve-related morbidity for octogenarians was determined by multivariate 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: In general, risk-adjusted analyses did not reveal an increased risk of 
operative mortality (p = 0.4), postoperative atrial fibrillation (p = 0.2), 
prolonged ventilation (p = 0.5), prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (p = 
0.3), or mid-term valve-related morbidity as prosthetic valve endocarditis (p = 
0.2), reoperation (p = 0.4), bleeding events (p = 0.1), and stroke (p = 0.8) for 
octogenarians. Continuously increasing age was an independent risk factor for 
postoperative neurological complications (OR = 1.8 per 10 years, p = 0.04). 
Quality of life was equal to or better than the general population of the same 
age. Median survival time of octogenarians was 5.2 +/- 0.5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Except for postoperative neurological complications, octogenarians 
receiving stentless bioprostheses had no increased risk of adverse perioperative 
and mid-term outcome in comparison to younger patients. As quality of life and 
life expectancy after AVR with stentless valves were equal to the general 
population, AVR with stentless bioprostheses should not be withheld from 
octogenarians.

Cost-utility analysis of cochlear implants in Korea using different measures of 
utility.

CONCLUSIONS: All cost-utility ratios obtained using the various measures of 
utility except quality well-being (QWB) were below 25,000 dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Therefore, treatment of post-lingual deaf 
adults with cochlear implants improves the quality of life at a reasonable 
direct cost and appears to produce net savings for Korean society.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the quality of life and the cost consequences of 
cochlear implants for deaf adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using data from 11 
post-lingual deaf adults who had received cochlear implants between 1990 and 
2002 in Seoul, Korea. The average age of the participants was 49.6 years. The 
main outcome was the direct cost per QALY calculated using the visual analog 
scale (VAS), health utility index (HUI), EuroQol (EQ-5D) measure and QWB 
measure. Costs and utility were discounted 3% annually.
RESULTS: Recipients used implants for an average of 5.6 years. The mean VAS, 
HUI, EQ-5D, and QWB score increased by 0.33 (from 0.27 before implantation to 
0.60 at survey), 0.36 (0.29 to 0.65), 0.26 (0.52 to 0.78), and 0.16 (0.45 to 
0.61), respectively. The discounted direct cost was 22,320 dollars, which 
yielded a cost-utility ratio of 19,223 dollars per QALY using VAS, 17,387 
dollars per QALY using HUI, 24,604 dollars per QALY using EQ-5D, and 40,474 
dollars per QALY using QWB.

BACKGROUND: In the elderly, mitral regurgitation (MR) is frequent, but surgery 
risks are considered high. Benefits and indications of MR surgery are uncertain 
in the elderly.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, outcome, and trends for surgical 
results improvement were analyzed in elderly patients (> or = 75 years of age; 
n=284) operated on for MR in 1980 to 1995 compared with younger patients (65 to 
74 years of age, n=504; and <65 years of age, n=556). Preoperatively, class III 
to IV symptoms, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, creatinine, and 
comorbidity index were more severe in elderly patients (all P<0.002). In the 
long term after surgery, observed survival stratified by age (> or = 75, 65 to 
74, <65 years) was lower in elderly than in younger patients (at 5 years, 
57+/-3%, 73+/-2%, and 85+/-2%, respectively; P<0.001), but ratios of observed to 
expected survival were similar (83%, 85%, and 88%, respectively). In 
multivariate analysis adjusted to expected survival, elderly patients showed no 
difference in life expectancy restoration compared with younger patients 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.30; P=0.54). 
Temporal trends showed that risk of operative mortality, although higher in 
elderly patients (P<0.001), declined markedly for all ages (27% to 5% in those > 
or = 75 years of age, P<0.01; 21% to 4% in those 65 to 74 years of age, P<0.01; 
and 7% to 2% in those <65 years of age, P=0.06), with a parallel decline in low 
cardiac output and length of hospital stay. Over time, valve repair feasibility 
increased in all age groups (30% to 84% overall and 31% to 93% in degenerative 
MR; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing MR surgery display more severe 
preoperative characteristics and incur higher operative risks than younger 
patients. However, restoration of life expectancy after surgery is similar in 
elderly and younger patients, and outstanding recent surgical improvements 
particularly benefited elderly patients. Thus, elderly patients with MR can now 
carefully be considered for surgery before refractory heart failure is present.

The Drosophila reticulon, Rtnl-1, has multiple differentially expressed isoforms 
that are associated with a sub-compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The reticulons are a recently discovered family of proteins that have a 
predominant localisation to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The 
precise function of the reticulons is unclear despite their presence in a wide 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Here we describe the characterisation of the 
Drosophila reticulon, reticulon-like1 (Rtnl1), which is the only functional 
reticulon in Drosophila. The Rtnl1 locus produces seven predicted mRNA 
transcripts encoding five different protein isoforms. The different transcripts 
have tissue-specific expression patterns remarkably similar to their mammalian 
counterparts. Rtnl1 protein is associated with organelles of the secretory 
pathway including the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Rtnl1 
function appears to be non-essential or redundant since loss of function Rtnl1 
mutants are viable. However, a significant reduction in life expectancy was seen 
in Rtnl1 mutant flies. This may point towards a possible protective role for 
reticulons against conditions of environmental stress.

At what hip fracture risk is it cost-effective to treat? International 
intervention thresholds for the treatment of osteoporosis.

Borgström F(1), Johnell O, Kanis JA, Jönsson B, Rehnberg C.

Author information:
(1)Medical Management Centre, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

INTRODUCTION: Intervention thresholds (ITs), the 10-year hip fracture risk at 
which treatment can be considered to be cost-effective, have previously been 
estimated for Sweden and the UK.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a Markov cohort model platform 
for a multinational estimation of thresholds at which intervention becomes 
cost-effective and to investigate and determine the main factors behind 
differences in these thresholds between countries.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Intervention thresholds were estimated for Australia, 
Germany, Japan, Sweden, Spain, the UK and USA using a societal perspective. The 
model was populated with as much relevant country-specific data as possible. 
Intervention was assumed to be given for 5 years and to decrease the risk of all 
osteoporotic fractures by 35%. The societal willingness to pay (WTP) for a 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was set to the gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita multiplied by two. In the base case analysis, the 10-year hip 
fracture probability at which intervention became cost-effective varied across 
ages and countries. For women starting therapy at an age of 70 years, the IT 
varied from a hip fracture probability of 5.6% in Japan to 14.7% in Spain. The 
main factors explaining differences in the IT between countries were the WTP for 
a QALY gained, fracture-related costs and intervention costs.
CONCLUSION: The ITs presented in this paper are appropriate for use in treatment 
guidelines that consider health economic aspects, and they can be used in 
combination with fracture risk prediction algorithms to improve the selection of 
patients who are suitable for osteoporotic intervention.

Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 
USA.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents preliminary U.S. data on deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, leading causes of death, and infant mortality for the year 2004 
by selected characteristics such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.
METHODS: Data in this report are based on a large number of deaths comprising 
approximately 91 percent of the demographic file and 90 percent of the medical 
file for all deaths in the United States in 2004. The records are weighted to 
independent control counts for 2004. For certain causes of death such as 
unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, and respiratory diseases, 
preliminary and final data differ because of the truncated nature of the 
preliminary file. Comparisons are made with 2003 final data.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate for the United States decreased from 832.7 
deaths per 100,000 population in 2003 to 801.0 deaths per 100,000 population in 
2004. Age-adjusted death rates decreased between 2003 and 2004 for the following 
major causes of death: Diseases of heart, Malignant neoplasms, Cerebrovascular 
diseases, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, Accidents (unintentional 
injuries), Diabetes mellitus, Influenza and pneumonia, Septicemia, Chronic liver 
disease and cirrhosis, and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids. Rates 
increased between 2003 and 2004 for the following: Alzheimer's disease and 
Essential (primary) hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. Life expectancy 
at birth rose by 0.4 year to a record high of 77.9 years.

The main trends in the palaeodemography of the 7th-18th century population of 
Latvia.

The study represents palaeodemographic research of osteological material of 3304 
individuals from the funds of the Anthropological Laboratory of the Institute of 
History of the University of Latvia in Riga, dating from the 7th to the 18th 
century AD. Compensated life expectancy at birth is varying between 20.3 and 
22.2 years during the research period. Crude mortality has changed between 49.3 
and 45% per hundred. In the early period (7th-13th century) there is a 
significant male prevalence (2.2-1.4); female life expectancy at the age of 20 
is on average 6.6 years less than for males. This difference decreases to 5.4 
years in the 13th-18th century. According to historical demography, female life 
span exceeded male only in the 2nd half of 19th century. The palaeodemographic 
data indicate that in the 7th-18th century, women in Latvia gave birth to a mean 
of 4-5 children (the figure includes childless women), of whom half, at most 
2-2.5, reached reproductive age, on account of high child mortality. The net 
reproductive rate R0 (the number of descendants per individual of the parents' 
generation) varies between 1 and 1.25 in the study period. Concerning the 
completely excavated cemeteries of Lejasbiteni (7th-10h century) and Daudziesi 
(16th-17th century), it was possible to calculate the size and structure of the 
populations that had used these cemeteries. They were similar, having 45.3-49.9% 
of children up to an age of 14 and 24-28% individuals over the age of 30. 
According to historical demography, radical improvement of the demographic 
situation in Latvia began in the second half of the 19th century, when the 
process of demographic transition in Latvia started.

Applying socioemotional selectivity theory to the domain of health, we examined 
the interplay of social-cognitive predictors of physical exercise in two groups 
of people who perceived their remaining lifetime as either expansive or limited 
(based on subjective longevity ratings). Individuals (N = 370) who were 
prescribed physical exercise were assessed at discharge from orthopedic 
rehabilitation as well as 6 and 12 months later. Multigroup structural equation 
modeling showed differences in latent means, interrelations of predictors, and 
amount of explained variance. Individuals who perceived their time as limited 
reported a less favorable profile on social-cognitive variables and less 
exercise goal attainment. We give first insights on how health self-regulation 
differs in these groups, and we discuss avenues for intervention based on 
socioemotional selectivity theory. In contrast to chronological age, subjective 
life expectancy can be targeted by intervention.

Old age, life extension, and the character of medical choice.

Author information:
(1)Institute for Health and Aging, Box 0646, University of California, San 
Francisco, CA 94143-0646, USA. Kaufman@itsa.ucsf.edu

OBJECTIVES: This qualitative, ethnographic study explores the character and 
extent of medical choice for life-extending procedures on older adults. It 
examines the sociomedical features of treatment that shape health care provider 
understandings of the nature of choice, and it illustrates the effects of 
treatment patterns on patients' perspectives of their options for life 
extension.
METHODS: By using participant observation in outpatient clinics and face-to-face 
interviews, we spoke with a convenience sample of 38 health professionals and 
132 patients aged 70 or older who had undergone life-extending medical 
procedures. We asked providers and patients open-ended questions about their 
understandings of medical choice for cardiac procedures, dialysis, and kidney 
transplant.
RESULTS: Neither patients nor health professionals made choices about the start 
or continuation of life-extending interventions that were uninformed by the 
routine pathways of treatment; the pressures of the technological imperative; or 
the growing normalization, ease, and safety of treating ever older patients. We 
found a difference among cardiac, dialysis, and transplant procedures regarding 
the locus of responsibility for maintaining and extending life.
DISCUSSION: Provider and patient practices together reveal how the standard use 
of medical procedures at ever older ages trumps patient-initiated decision 
making.

Attitude toward risk is an important factor determining patient preferences. 
Risk behavior has been shown to be strongly dependent on the perception of the 
outcome as either a gain or a loss. According to prospect theory, the reference 
point determines how an outcome is perceived. However, no theory on the location 
of the reference point exists, and for the health domain, there is no direct 
evidence for the location of the reference point. This article combines 
qualitative with quantitative data to provide evidence of the reference point in 
life-year certainty equivalent (CE) gambles and to explore the psychology behind 
the reference point. The authors argue that goals (aspirations) in life 
influence the reference point. While thinking aloud, 45 healthy respondents gave 
certainty equivalents for life-year CE gambles with long and short durations of 
survival. Contrary to suggestions from the literature, qualitative data argued 
that the offered certainty equivalent most frequently served as the reference 
point. Thus, respondents perceived life-year CE gambles as mixed. Framing of the 
question and goals set in life appeared to be important factors behind the 
psychology of the reference point. On the basis of the authors' quantitative and 
qualitative data, they argue that goals alter the perception of outcomes as 
described by prospect theory by influencing the reference point. This 
relationship is more apparent for the near future as opposed to the remote 
future, as goals are mostly set for the near future.

Process utility in breast biopsy.

Swan JS(1), Lawrence WF, Roy J.

Author information:
(1)Indiana University, Department of Radiology Education and Research Institute, 
Indianapolis, USA. shannon@mgh-ita.org

PURPOSE: To determine whether the waiting trade-off (WTO) is feasible for 
differentiating short-term biopsy preferences in an acute situation where 
anxiety is the symptomatic disease state.
METHODS: 75 women with past experience of either breast core-needle biopsy 
(CNB), more invasive excisional surgical biopsy (EXB), or both, had telephone 
WTO assessments. Patients' baseline and test-related anxiety were valued by time 
trade-off (TTO) used to scale the WTO. Rating scales (RS) were obtained for 
convergent validity assessment with WTO and TTO.
RESULTS: Data were obtained in 38 women who had both CNB and EXB ("paired") and 
20 who had CNB only and 16 who had EXB only ("unpaired"). Patients rated only 
the procedure(s) they experienced. Median paired and mean unpaired WTO scores 
indicated patients were willing to wait significantly longer to avoid EXB (P = 
0.0003, P = 0.0002, respectively). The waiting time difference between EXB and 
CNB was 2.1 weeks greater in unpaired data than paired data. RS scores comparing 
the procedures were significantly different only for paired data (P < 0.05). 
Median TTO preferences for baseline (1.00) and test anxiety (0.93) obtained in 
74 patients were significantly different (P < 0.0001) and consistent with RS. 
Correlation was noted between WTO and RS (-0.307 to -0.453, P = 0.0205 to 
0.0001). The median EXB quality-adjusted life years toll (1.5 quality-adjusted 
life days) calculated from pooled WTO data (paired and unpaired) from 54 
patients is near a threshold in a published model.
CONCLUSION: The WTO is feasible for discriminating preferences for short-term 
health states in an acute medical scenario where it might have been expected to 
be impracticable.

BACKGROUND: The Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine has called 
for an "off-the-shelf" catalogue of nationally representative, community-based 
preference scores for health states, illnesses, and conditions. A previous 
review of cost-effectiveness analyses found that 77% did not incorporate 
community-based preferences, and 33% used arbitrary expert or author judgment. 
These results highlight the necessity of making a wide array of appropriate, 
community-based estimates more accessible to cost-effectiveness researchers.
OBJECTIVE: To provide nationally representative EQ-5D index scores for chronic 
ICD-9 codes.
METHODS: The nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 
was pooled (2000-2002) to create a data set of 38,678 adults. Ordinary least 
squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression 
methods were used to estimate the marginal disutility of each condition, 
controlling for age, comorbidity, gender, race, ethnicity, income, and 
education.
RESULTS: Most chronic conditions, age, comorbidity, income, and education were 
highly statistically significant predictors of EQ-5D index scores. 
Homoskedasticity and normality assumptions were rejected, suggesting only CLAD 
estimates are theoretically unbiased. The magnitude and statistical significance 
of coefficients varied by analytic method. OLS and Tobit coefficients were on 
average 60% and 143% greater than CLAD, respectively. The marginal disutility of 
95 chronic ICD-9 codes as well as unadjusted mean, median, and 25th and 75th 
percentiles are reported.
CONCLUSION: This research provides nationally representative, community-based 
EQ-5D index scores associated with a wide variety of chronic ICD-9 codes that 
can be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years in cost-effectiveness 
analyses.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(4):CD001556.

BACKGROUND: Surgery has been the treatment of choice for localized esophageal 
cancer. A number of studies have investigated whether preoperative chemotherapy 
followed by surgery leads to an improvement in cure rates but the individual 
reports have been conflicting. An explicit systematic update of the role of 
preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of resectable thoracic esophageal 
cancer is, therefore, warranted.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to determine the role of 
preoperative chemotherapy on patients with resectable thoracic esophageal 
carcinomas.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1988 to 
2006) and CANCERLIT (1993 to 2002). There were no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials of patients with potentially resectable 
carcinomas of the esophagus (of any histologic type) who were randomised to 
having either chemotherapy or no chemotherapy before surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was survival, which was 
assessed using hazard ratios. This is an amendment to the original review which 
used relative risks to assess survival at yearly intervals. Hazard ratios (HR) 
have now been introduced to summarise the complete survival experience in a 
single analysis. The risk ratio (relative risk; RR) was used to compare rates of 
resections, tumour recurrences and treatment morbidity and mortality.
MAIN RESULTS: There were eleven randomised trials involving 2019 patients. Eight 
trials (1729 patients) reported sufficient detail on survival to be included in 
a meta-analysis for the primary outcome. There was some evidence to suggest that 
preoperative chemotherapy improves survival, but this was inconclusive (HR 0.88; 
95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). There was no evidence to suggest that the overall rate of 
resections (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01) or the rate of complete resections 
(R0) (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15) differ between the preoperative chemotherapy 
arm and surgery alone. There is no evidence that tumour recurrence (RR 0.81, 95% 
CI 0.54 to 1.22) or non-fatal complication rates (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06) 
differ for preoperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone. Trials reported 
risks of toxicity with chemotherapy that ranged from 11% to 90%.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery may 
offer a survival advantage compared to surgery alone for resectable thoracic 
esophageal cancer, but the evidence is inconclusive. There is some evidence of 
toxicity and preoperative mortality associated with chemotherapy.

Low socio-economic status (SES) is associated with a shortened life expectancy, 
but its effect on aging is unknown. The rate of white-blood-cell (WBC) telomere 
attrition may be a biological indicator of human aging. We tested the hypothesis 
that SES is associated with telomere attrition independent of known risk factors 
influencing the aging process. We studied 1552 female twins. A venous blood 
sample was taken from each twin and isolated WBCs used for extraction of DNA. 
Terminal restriction fragment length (TRFL) was measured. Questionnaire data 
were collected on occupation, education, income, smoking, exercise, height and 
weight. Standard multiple linear regression and multivariate analyses of 
variance tested for associations between SES and TRFL, adjusting for covariates. 
A discordant twin analysis was conducted on a subset to verify findings. WBC 
telomere length was highly variable but significantly shorter in lower SES 
groups. The mean difference in TRFL between nonmanual and manual SES groups was 
163.2 base pairs (bp) of which 22.9 bp (approximately 14%) was accounted for by 
body mass index, smoking and exercise. Comparison of TRFL in the 17 most 
discordant SES twin pairs confirmed this difference. Low SES, in addition to the 
harmful effects of smoking, obesity and lack of exercise, appears to have an 
impact on telomere length.

of hairy cell leukemia patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B-cell 
lymphoproliferative disorder which is treated effectively by interferon-alpha 
(IFN-alpha), deoxycoformycin (DCF) and 2-clorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA). As a third 
of patients treated with DCF do not achieve a complete remission (CR) and many 
of them tend to relapse, we evaluated the potential role of IFN-alpha, randomly 
administered after DCF, in increasing the number of patients attaining CR and/or 
duration of CR.
METHODS: From March 1997 to December 2000, 167 previously untreated HCL 
patients, from 37 Italian institutions, were enrolled in the study. A total of 
138 males and 29 females, with a median age of 55 yr were included in the study. 
All patients received six courses of DCF 4 mg/m(2) i.v. every other week and 
then two additional courses once a month. Complete and partial responders were 
randomly assigned to receive or not receive IFN-alpha at a dose of 3 MU s.c. 
three times a week for 6 months.
RESULTS: Of the 167 patients enrolled in the study, 145 (86.8%) obtained a CR or 
a partial remission (PR) and were therefore suitable for randomization. One 
hundred and thirty-five patients were successively randomized to receive 
IFN-alpha (63 cases; arm A) or not (72 cases; arm B). Progression of disease was 
observed in eight (arm A) and 12 (arm B) patients with a median time of 27.8 and 
26.9 months, respectively. As far as the improvement in response was concerned, 
no significant difference in the two subgroups was observed. In fact, five 
patients in arm A and six patients in arm B showing a good PR at the end of DCF 
therapy, subsequently attained a late CR.
CONCLUSIONS: From our data there does not appear to be any significant role for 
IFN-alpha in improving the proportion and the duration of CR in HCL patients 
previously treated with DCF.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) affects approximately 1 per 650-1000 live births 
and is the most common known genetic cause of intellectual disability. A highly 
significant change in the survival of people with DS has occurred during the 
last two generations, with life expectancy estimates increasing from 12 to 
nearly 60 years of age.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Detailed information on 1332 people in Western Australia 
with DS was abstracted from a specialist statewide database for the period 
1953-2000 and electronically linked with three other state or national health 
and mortality data sources and the state Birth Defects Registry.
RESULTS: Over the last 25 years the percentage of women over 35 years giving 
birth increased from 4.8 to 18.6%, accompanied by an increase in the overall 
prevalence of DS from 1.1 to 2.9 per 1000 births. Four life stages of DS were 
identified: prenatal, childhood and early adulthood, adulthood, and senescence. 
Although pneumonia, or other types of respiratory infections, was the most 
common cause of death across the entire lifespan, ranging from 23% of deaths in 
adulthood to 40% in senescence, each life stage exhibited a particular profile 
of comorbidities. Congenital heart defects were common causes in childhood (13%) 
and adulthood (23%), whereas in senescence coronary artery disease (10%) and 
cardiac, renal, and respiratory failure (9%) were leading causes of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: A major re-appraisal in attitudes towards DS is required to ensure 
that the medical and social needs of people with the disorder are adequately met 
across their entire lifespan. In particular, specific recognition of the 
comorbidities that can arise at different ages is needed, accompanied by the 
provision of appropriate levels of care and management.

Caloric restriction does not enhance longevity in all species and is unlikely to 
do so in humans.

Calorie restriction is known to increase lifespan in many but not all species 
and may perhaps not do so in humans. Exceptions to life extension have been 
identified in the laboratory and others are known in nature. Given the variety 
of physiological responses to variation in food supply that are possible, 
evolutionary life history theory indicates that an increased investment in 
maintenance in response to resource shortage will not always be the strategy 
that maximises Darwinian fitness. Additionally, for the well-studied species in 
which life extension is observed, there is considerable variation in the 
response. This suggests that it is not an ancient ancestral response, which has 
been conserved across the species range. Although calorie restriction does not 
increase lifespan in all species, it remains a fascinating and valuable tool to 
study ageing at the whole organism level.

Variation in life table characteristics among populations of Phlebotomus 
papatasi at different altitudes.

Laboratories, Hacettepe University, 06800, Ankara-Turkey.

Baseline biological growth data were obtained under laboratory conditions for 
four local populations of the phlebotomine sand fly R papatasi (Scopoli, 1786) 
(Diptera: Psychodidae) in different eco-regions at altitudes between 368 and 
1117 m in the Sanliurfa province of Turkey. The developmental time from egg to 
adult was found to be significantly different among the populations: 36 days for 
the AKL population (368 m), 43 days for the HHR population (488 m), 45 days for 
the HMD population (644 m), and 49 days for the ALT population (1117 m), 
respectively. Based on cohorts of adults in each population, horizontal life 
tables were constructed. The average longevity was determined to be in the range 
of 8.75 +/- 2.39 to 11.60 +/- 3.48 days for adult females, and it was found to 
be slightly longer for adult males. No significant difference was found in life 
expectancy at emergence, e(x) when x=1, between females and males in general 
(P>0.05) in all the populations. While significant differences could be 
demonstrated among populations for predictive parameters such as net 
reproductive rate, Ro, and generation time, Tc, no significant differences among 
the populations were found in terms of intrinsic rate of increase, r(m), finite 
rate of increase, lambda, birth (b) and death (d) rates (P>0.05). Populations 
that produced offspring earlier in life also produced more total female 
offspring, since Tc was negatively correlated with Ro among the populations (r = 
-0.686, 0.01<P<0.05). Twenty-seven parameters in all life stages, both pre-adult 
and adult features of R papatasi, were used as physiological variables and these 
operational taxonomic units were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis. 
Analyses confirmed results from the previous morphometric and molecular studies 
that the Alitas population orientated and clustered as a distinct group along 
the first two PCs.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology and the relevant factors such as age, sex, 
blood pressure, outcomes and causes of death in end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
with hemodialysis (HD) in some hospitals in Hunan province.
METHODS: The retrospective analysis included 1,622 ESRD with HD patients. Data 
on the etiology, demographic and epidemiologic aspects of these patients were 
examined, and life expectancy and mortality rate were calculated.
RESULTS: In 1,622 ESRD with HD patients, the average age at the start of HD was 
46.91 +/- 15.41, and the male/female ratio was 1.45/1. As the leading cause, 
chronic glomerulonephritis accounted for 56.43%, followed by hypertensive 
nephropathy (12.58%), obstructive nephropathy (9.13%) and diabetic nephropathy 
(8.85%). In recent years, the constituent ratio of diabetic nephropathy rose. 
The number of ESRD maintenance HD (MHD) patients was 581. Among them, 43.7% 
remained MHD, 13.0% received renal transplantation, 19.9% were transferred to 
other hospitals for HD, 7.2% became peritoneal dialysis, 14.8% died, and 1.4% 
ceased treament for economic reasons. The longest MHD was 13 years. The 
1st-year, 3rd-year and 5th-year survial rate of MHD patients was 93.53%, 68.92% 
and 62.51%, respectively. The leading cause of death was cardiovascular 
incidence. In this group of ESRD with (53.6%), and then cerebrovascular disorder 
(21.0%).
CONCLUSION: HD patients, the age of starting dialysis was 30 approximately 70. 
The first cause was chronic glomerulonephritis. As the age increased, the 
constituent ratio of diabetic nephropathy rose. In MHD patients, the 1st-year, 
3rd-year and 5th-year survial rate of maintenance hemodialysis patients was 
93.53%, 68.92% and 62.51%, respectively. The first cause of death was 
cardiovascular accidence, and then cerebrovascular disorder.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute tolerance to definitive 
external-beam radiation therapy (RT; EBRT) in patients with prostate 
adenocarcinoma and HIV and to review the published literature for this 
population. Three patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and HIV were treated 
with definitive RT. Medical records were reviewed for prostate cancer and HIV 
characteristics, RT details, and acute toxicity. A review of the published 
literature was performed for epidemiology, management, and outcome of these 
patients. All 3 patients had excellent acute tolerance to definitive EBRT and, 
with short follow-up, all had decreasing prostate-specific antigen levels. The 
published literature regarding patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and HIV is 
scarce but suggests that men with HIV might be at higher risk of developing 
prostate cancer. External-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and surgery 
have all been used in the management of these patients. All 3 patients with 
prostate adenocarcinoma and HIV had an excellent acute tolerance to EBRT. 
Prostate cancer is expected to become an increasingly important health problem 
for men infected with HIV as their life expectancy lengthens.

Managed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a 
comprehensive work is carried out in numerous laboratories to develop test 
guidelines for the detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in humans, and 
various animal species. Development of tests to detect chemicals with endocrine 
disrupting properties in fish is a part of that work. A Fish Sexual Development 
Test (FSDT) (an extension of the existing OECD TG 210, fish early life stage 
toxicity test), proposed as an international test guideline for the detection of 
endocrine disrupting chemicals, was evaluated by water exposure of juvenile 
zebrafish to the three natural estrogens: estrone, 17beta-estradiol, and estriol 
and the synthetic androgen trenbolone (trenbolone acetate). As endpoints, 
vitellogenin induction and histological changes including changes in sex ratios 
were investigated. The sex ratio was significantly altered towards females from 
49 ng/l estrone, 54 ng/l 17beta-estradiol and 22 microg/l estriol, respectively. 
An all male population was observed from exposure to 9.7 ng/l trenbolone and 
above. Significant vitellogenin induction in whole body homogenate was measured 
after exposure to 14 ng/l estrone, 54 ng/l 17beta-estradiol and 0.6 mug/l 
estriol, respectively. Significant vitellogenin reduction was measured after 
exposure to 193 ng/l trenbolone or higher. The present results provide strong 
evidence that the FSDT is a sensitive test toward estrogenic and especially 
androgenic exposure and the validation of the FSDT as an OECD test guideline 
should continue.

AIMS: The authors examined causes of death contributing to the relatively high 
mortality of Danish women born 1915-45, and evaluated the impact of smoking 
related causes of death.
METHODS: Age-period-cohort analysis of mortality of Danish women aged 40-89 in 
1960-98. Estimate of the negative curvature in parabola patterns for 50 causes 
of death.
RESULTS: A total of 34 causes of death contributed to the relatively high 
mortality for women born 1915-45. The main contribution came from 
smoking-related causes of death.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a high smoking prevalence to be the main 
explanation behind the relatively low life expectancy of Danish women born 
1915-45.

A cost effectiveness analysis within a randomised controlled trial of post-acute 
care of older people in a community hospital.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of post-acute care for older people 
in a locality based community hospital compared with a department for care of 
elderly people in a district general hospital, which admits patients aged over 
76 years with acute medical conditions.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis within a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Community hospital and district general hospital in Yorkshire, England.
PARTICIPANTS: 220 patients needing rehabilitation after an acute illness for 
which they required admission to hospital.
INTERVENTIONS: Multidisciplinary care in the district general hospital or prompt 
transfer to the community hospital.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: EuroQol EQ-5D scores transformed into quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and health and social service costs over six months from 
randomisation.
RESULTS: The mean QALY score for the community hospital group was marginally 
non-significantly higher than that for the district general hospital group (0.38 
v 0.35) at six months after recruitment. The mean (standard deviation) costs per 
patient of the health and social services resources used were similar for both 
groups: community hospital group 7233 pounds sterling (euros 10,567; 13,341 
dollars) (5031 pounds sterling), district general hospital group 7351 pounds 
sterling(6229 pounds sterling), and these findings were robust to several 
sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for community 
hospital care dominated. A cost effectiveness acceptability curve, based on 
bootstrapped simulations, suggests that at a willingness to pay threshold of 
10,000 pounds sterling per QALY, 51% of community hospital cases will be cost 
effective, which rises to 53% of cases when the threshold is 30,000 pounds 
sterling per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Post-acute care for older people in a locality based community 
hospital is of similar cost effectiveness to that of an elderly care department 
in a district general hospital.

Placement of dental implants may improve the retention and stability of complete 
dentures in edentulous patients. Treatment costs, however, substantially 
increase with implant treatment. We therefore performed a stochastic 
cost-effectiveness analysis, comparing implant-supported over-denture prostheses 
(4 implants), implant-retained overdentures (2 implants), and complete dentures, 
from the patient's perspective in Switzerland, to assess whether implant 
treatment in the mandible represents value for money spent. Twenty patients were 
included in each treatment group and were followed up for three years. Health 
outcomes were expressed in Quality-adjusted Prosthesis Years, and dental health 
care costs and time costs were recorded in year 2000 Swiss Francs (CHF 100 = US 
dollars 61). The cost per Quality-adjusted Prosthesis Year gained for implant 
treatment was CHF 9100 (2 implants) and CHF 19,800 (4 implants) over 3 years. 
Over a ten-year period, these threshold ratios were reduced to CHF 3800 (2 
implants) and CHF 7100 (4 implants) per Quality-adjusted Prosthesis Year gained.

Riga LV 1007, Latvia.

Edentulism is considered a poor health outcome and may compromise the quality of 
life. Although the number of adults losing their natural teeth is diminishing, 
there are still large numbers of edentulous adults in the population. A 
retrospective study was conducted with information derived from literature (from 
1984 till 2004) about the patients who experienced ongoing difficulties with new 
complete dentures, to determine possible underlying causes. Relationships were 
observed when denture construction or design faults were compared with patient 
complaints and the advised solution of the problem. CONCLUSION. This study 
suggests that in most instances, complete denture patients present with 
complaints only when there is real design fault. Clinician must carefully 
evaluate the denture for faults in denture base extension and horizontal and 
vertical jaw relationships.
