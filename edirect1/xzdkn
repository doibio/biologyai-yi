BACKGROUND: In light of the increasing trend in the global number of individuals 
affected by dementia and the lack of any available disease-modifying therapies, 
it is necessary to fully understand and quantify the global burden of dementia. 
This work aimed to estimate the proportion of dementia due to Down syndrome, 
Parkinson's disease, clinical stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), globally 
and by world region, in order to better understand the contribution of clinical 
diseases to dementia prevalence.
METHODS: Through literature review, we obtained data on the relative risk of 
dementia with each condition and estimated relative risks by age using a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool. We then calculated population attributable 
fractions (PAFs), or the proportion of dementia attributable to each condition, 
using the estimates of relative risk and prevalence estimates for each condition 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Finally, we multiplied these 
estimates by dementia prevalence to calculate the number of dementia cases 
attributable to each condition.
FINDINGS: For each clinical condition, the relative risk of dementia decreased 
with age. Relative risks were highest for Down syndrome, followed by Parkinson's 
disease, stroke, and TBI. However, due to the high prevalence of stroke, the PAF 
for dementia due to stroke was highest. Together, Down syndrome, Parkinson's 
disease, stroke, and TBI explained 10.0% (95% UI: 6.0-16.5) of the global 
prevalence of dementia.
INTERPRETATION: Ten percent of dementia prevalence globally could be explained 
by Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI. The quantification of 
the proportion of dementia attributable to these 4 conditions constitutes a 
small contribution to our overall understanding of what causes dementia. 
However, epidemiological research into modifiable risk factors as well as basic 
science research focused on elucidating intervention approaches to prevent or 
delay the neuropathological changes that commonly characterize dementia will be 
critically important in future efforts to prevent and treat disease.

INTRODUCTION: An unexpected resurgence of pertussis cases and infant deaths was 
observed in some countries that had switched to acellular pertussis vaccines in 
the primary immunisation schedule. In response to the outbreaks, maternal 
pertussis vaccination programmes in pregnant women have been adopted worldwide, 
including the USA in 2011 and the UK in 2012. Following the success of the 
programme in England, we evaluated the health and economic impact of stopping 
versus continuing the maternal pertussis immunisation to inform public health 
policy making.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate the number of infant 
hospitalisations and deaths related to pertussis in England over 2019-2038. 
Losses in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, were considered for infants (aged 
0-2 months) who survived or died from pertussis, bereaved parents (of infants 
who died from pertussis), and women with pertussis (aged 20-44 years). Direct 
medical costs to the National Health Service included infant hospitalisations, 
maternal vaccinations, and disease in women. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 
3.5%. Changes in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER, were explored 
in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The model supports continuing the maternal pertussis immunisation 
programme as a cost-effective intervention at an ICER of £14,500/QALY (2.5% and 
97.5%-quantile: £7,300/QALY to £32,400/QALY). Stopping versus continuing the 
maternal programme results in an estimated mean of 972 (range 582 to 1489) 
versus 308 (184 to 471) infant hospitalisations annually. Results were most 
sensitive to the number of hospitalisations and deaths when stopping the 
maternal programme. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000/QALY, the 
probability of the maternal programme being cost-effective was 96.2%.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support continuing the maternal pertussis vaccination 
programme as otherwise higher levels of disease activity and infant mortality 
are expected to return. These results have led policy makers to decide to 
continue the maternal programme in the UK routine immunisation schedule.

BACKGROUND: Slipping on snow or ice poses a significant health risk among older 
adults in Sweden. To combat this problem, about 80 Swedish municipalities have 
distributed ice cleats to older citizens (65+ years old) over the last decade. 
This paper details a cost-benefit analysis of such programmes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision-analytical model to estimate the 
costs and benefits of ice cleat programmes in Swedish municipalities compared 
with a business-as-usual scenario. The modelled benefits of the programme were 
based on effect estimates from previous research, data from population and 
healthcare registers and a survey of attitudes to and actual ice cleat use. The 
modelled costs of the programme were based on resource use data collected from 
34 municipalities with existing ice cleat programmes. We assessed heterogeneity 
in the potential impact and benefit-to-cost ratios across all Swedish 
municipalities as a function of the average number of days with snow cover per 
year. Uncertainty in the cost-benefit results was assessed using deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The average benefit-to-cost ratio was 87, ranging from about 40 in 
low-risk municipalities to 140 in high-risk municipalities, implying that the 
potential benefits of ice cleat programmes greatly outweigh their costs. 
Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses support the robustness of 
this conclusion to parameter uncertainty and large changes in assumptions about 
the magnitude of the impact on ice cleat use and injuries.
CONCLUSION: The benefits of distributing ice cleats to older adults appear to 
outweigh the costs from a Swedish societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the quality of patient-reported 
outcome (PRO) data in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) clinical trial 
publications.
METHODS: A systematic search of citations from various databases was conducted 
to identify prospective clinical trials involving ICI in advanced tumors from 
2003 to 2020. A 30-point score was adapted from the CONSORT PRO extension 
statement to assess adherence to CONSORT PRO reporting. Linear regression was 
used to identify factors associated with quality reporting.
RESULTS: After the review of 8058 articles, 33 trials were included with ICIs as 
either monotherapy (91%) or part of a combination regimen (9%). The median score 
was 23.5 points (range 15-29). In the majority of cases (82%), PROs were 
reported in a separate publication from the original study. Most of the trials 
were conducted in the metastatic setting and predominantly in melanoma, lung, 
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (73%). Univariate analysis revealed that trials 
with greater than 250 patients were associated with a higher score. The score 
was more likely to be lower in disease sites other than melanoma, lung, and RCC 
and was higher in the KEYNOTE than in the CHECKMATE trial series. There was no 
significant correlation between the score and whether a trial met its primary 
end-point or if the trial improved or worsened the quality of life. In the 
multivariate analysis, the number of patients enrolled to the trial, disease 
site, and trial series remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of reporting of PROs in ICI phase II and III clinical 
trials is heterogeneous across various cancer sites. As PRO data are 
increasingly used to counsel patients and complement clinical decision making, 
innovative and collaborative efforts are required to improve the reporting of 
these essential data.

[Neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with mild cognitive impairment].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who asked for help in memory 
clinics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed data on 729 patients with MCI (average age 
76.6 years, average MMSE score 25.3), who underwent a course of cognitive 
neurorehabilitation in a specialized department - a memory clinic. A Russian 
version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used. We compared the indicators 
for the main psychometric scales for the diagnosis of MCI in comparison with the 
dynamics of NPS.
RESULTS: The prevalence rates for NPS differed in part from those reported in 
the literature. The most common symptom was anxiety (54.7%) and irritability 
(56.5%), while euphoria, as well as delusions and hallucinations were not 
detected. All disorders significantly reduced at the end of the rehabilitation 
program.
CONCLUSION: MCI influences the level of functioning and social interaction in 
older patients and mediates the quality of life. Thus, given the increase in 
life expectancy, it is necessary to introduce new methods of examination 
applicable in the practice of psychiatrists to diagnose and rehabilitate such 
patients. NPS turned out to be widespread in MCI, but may reduce during the 
course of complex neurorehabilitation.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Изучение распространенности нейропсихиатрических 
симптомов (НПС) у пациентов с синдромом мягкого когнитивного снижения (МКС), 
обратившихся за помощью в клиники памяти и прошедших курс реабилитации.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Проанализированы данные о 729 пациентах с МКС (средний 
возраст — 76,6 года, средний суммарный балл ММСЕ — 25,3), прошедших курс 
когнитивной нейрореабилитации в условиях специализированного отделения — клиники 
памяти Москвы и прошедших курс реабилитации. Для оценки НПС применялся 
нейропсихиатрический опросник (Neuropsychiatric Inventory — NPI; J. Cummings, 
1994), переведенный на русский язык. Сравнили показатели по основным 
психометрическим шкалам для диагностики МКС в сопоставлении с динамикой НПС.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Показатели распространенности НПС частично отличались от данных, 
приводимых в литературе. Тревога обнаруживалась в 54,7% наблюдений, 
раздражительность — в 56,5%, эйфория, бред и галлюцинации не выявлены. Все НПС 
значительно редуцировались по окончании реабилитационной программы.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: МКС напрямую влияет на уровень функционирования и социального 
взаимодействия у пациентов пожилого возраста. Учитывая увеличение 
продолжительности жизни, необходимо внедрять новые методы обследования с целью 
диагностики и реабилитации. НПС оказались широко распространены при МКС, но 
могут редуцироваться в ходе прохождения курса комплексной нейрореабилитации.

INTRODUCTION: Viral hepatitis often affects young people; it therefore seems 
reasonable to analyze the phenomenon of premature mortality due to this reason, 
using Years of Life Lost (YLLs) measurement.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze YLLs due to viral hepatitis in 
Poland in 2000-2014. For the years 2002 and 2011, socio-economic variables 
(marital status, level of education, working status, place of residence) were 
included.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research material was a database containing 
information from 5,601,568 death certificates of Polish citizens from 2000-2014. 
The data on deaths caused by viral hepatitis, i.e. coded as B15-B19 according to 
the ICD-10, was used for the analysis. The Standard Expected Years of Life Lost 
measure was used to calculate YLLs. Analysis of time trends was performed with 
the linear regression method using the joinpoint model.
RESULTS: In the studied period, 3.628 deaths of Polish citizens were caused by 
viral hepatitis (0.06% of all deaths), which translated to 92,845.70 YLLs (16.17 
years per 100,000 inhabitants). The number of YLLs increased over time (p<0.05), 
reaching its highest value in the last analyzed year - 22.14 years per 100,000. 
The YLLs average per one death was 25.59 years. Among the risk group there were 
individuals living in urban areas, divorced/separated, with lower than secondary 
education, and economically inactive.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that Poland belongs to a group of countries with 
low mortality due to viral hepatitis, this disease is a serious social problem 
as measured with YLLs. The study provides the basis for policymakers to 
implement more effective methods to prevent premature deaths caused by this 
disease.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is essential for 
eliminating HCV in people who inject drugs (PWID), but has limited coverage in 
resource-limited settings. We measured the cost-effectiveness of a pilot HCV 
screening and treatment intervention using directly observed therapy among PWID 
attending harm reduction services in Nairobi, Kenya.
DESIGN: We utilized an existing model of HIV and HCV transmission among current 
and former PWID in Nairobi to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening and 
treatment for HCV, including prevention benefits versus no screening and 
treatment. The cure rate of treatment and costs for screening and treatment were 
estimated from intervention data, while other model parameters were derived from 
literature. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a life-time horizon from the 
health-care provider's perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
SETTING: Nairobi, Kenya.
POPULATION: PWID.
MEASUREMENTS: Treatment costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per 
disability-adjusted life year averted).
FINDINGS: The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted for the 
intervention was $975, with 92.1% of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
simulations falling below the per capita gross domestic product for Kenya 
($1509; commonly used as a suitable threshold for determining whether an 
intervention is cost-effective). However, the intervention was not 
cost-effective at the opportunity cost-based cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$647 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Sensitivity analyses showed that 
the intervention could provide more value for money by including modelled 
estimates for HCV disease care costs, assuming lower drug prices ($75 instead of 
$728 per course) and excluding directly-observed therapy costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The current strategy of screening and treatment for hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) among people who inject drugs in Nairobi is likely to be highly 
cost-effective with currently available cheaper drug prices, if 
directly-observed therapy is not used and HCV disease care costs are accounted 
for.

Against a background of stalling UK life expectancy, the COVID-19 pandemic 
necessitated a different way of working for public health to respond quickly to 
new and many demands. At the same time, public health teams had to ensure they 
did not concentrate on the immediate crisis at the expense of mitigating 
longer-term impacts of the pandemic. This was, and is, a major challenge with 
additional demands on an already hard-pressed workforce. This paper discusses 
the experience of a local public health department in responding to the pandemic 
and raises four key areas that influenced decisions and need to be considered in 
future. These are care homes issues, addressing all four harms of the pandemic, 
lessons for behaviour change and the need to strengthen Scotland's public health 
workforce.

Against a background of stalling UK life expectancy, the COVID-19 pandemic is a 
major crisis for public health with impacts differing markedly by ethnicity, 
gender, and age. Direct health impacts include mortality and long-term harms 
among survivors. Social disruption and lockdown measures arising from 
uncontrolled infection have destabilised healthcare and other essential 
services. The economic crisis resulting from the pandemic is already triggering 
job losses, which will in turn have their own adverse health effects. These 
myriad impacts of the pandemic are not affecting everyone equally. Ethnic 
minorities, men and older people have disproportionately suffered from COVID-19, 
including their risk of mortality. However, some indirect impacts - including 
those on mental health and employment - are more likely to affect women and 
younger people. The health consequences of the pandemic will affect the lives of 
people in the UK for decades.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of global 
mortality representing about one third of all deaths across the world. The 
objective of the present study was to model the global trend in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and its components due to CVD over the 
past three decades. We also aimed to evaluate the longitudinal relationship 
between CVD DALY and Human Development Index (HDI) in this period of time.
METHODS: The age-standardized rates of years lost due to disability (YLD), years 
of life lost (YLL) and DALY were extracted for cardiovascular diseases from the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 in years 1990 to 2019. Additionally, 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) database was used to retrieve 
HDI values for all world countries at the same period time. The trend analysis 
was performed using the joinpoint regression model.
RESULTS: The obtained revealed a significant downward trend for DALY and its 
components with the average annual percent change of - 1.0, - 0.3 and - 1.1 per 
100,000 population, respectively for DALY, YLD and YLL. We also found that 
countries with high/very high levels of HDI have remarkably experienced steeper 
declining slope of trend than those in lower levels of HDI over the study 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the observed decreasing trend of CVD burden is a hopeful 
message for all world countries, the considerable gap in slope of trend between 
richer and poorer parts of the world is a serious alarm for health policy 
makers. Regarding this, there is an urgent need to put more efforts on 
implementing preventive programs, improving the level of patients' care and 
providing efficient treatment, especially in regions with lower levels of HDI.

OBJECTIVES: Levels, trends or changes in socioeconomic mortality differentials 
are typically described in terms of means, for example, life expectancies, but 
studies have suggested that there also are systematic social disparities in the 
dispersion around those means, in other words there are inequalities in lifespan 
variation. This study investigates changes in income inequalities in mean and 
distributional measures of mortality in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden 
over two decades.
DESIGN: Nationwide register-based study.
SETTING: The Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish populations aged 30 years or 
over in 1997 and 2017.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Income-specific changes in life expectancy, lifespan 
variation and the contribution of 'early' and 'late' deaths to increasing life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Increases in life expectancy has taken place in all four countries, but 
there are systematic differences across income groups. In general, the largest 
gains in life expectancy were observed in Denmark, and the smallest increase 
among low-income women in Sweden and Norway. Overall, life expectancy increased 
and lifespan variation decreased with increasing income level. These differences 
grew larger over time. In all countries, a marked postponement of early deaths 
led to a compression of mortality in the top three income quartiles for both 
genders. This did not occur for the lowest income quartile.
CONCLUSION: Increasing life expectancy is typically accompanied by postponement 
of early deaths and reduction of lifespan inequality in the higher-income 
groups. However, Nordic welfare societies are challenged by the fact that 
postponing premature deaths among people in the lowest-income groups is not 
taking place.

Brazil has been heavily affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this 
study, we used data on reported total deaths in 2020 and in January-April 2021 
to measure and compare the death toll across states. We estimate a decline in 
2020 life expectancy at birth (e0) of 1.3 years, a mortality level not seen 
since 2014. The reduction in life expectancy at age 65 (e65) in 2020 was 0.9 
years, setting Brazil back to 2012 levels. The decline was larger for males, 
widening by 9.1% the female-male gap in e0. Among states, Amazonas lost 60.4% of 
the improvements in e0 since 2000. In the first 4 months of 2021, COVID-19 
deaths represented 107% of the total 2020 figures. Assuming that death rates 
would have been equal to 2019 all-cause rates in the absence of COVID-19, 
COVID-19 deaths in 2021 have already reduced e0 in 2021 by 1.8 years, which is 
slightly larger than the reduction estimated for 2020 under similar assumptions.

The number of patients developing kidney failure is increasing globally 
including in India. Dialysis is not the most optimal treatment for a number of 
these patients such as the elderly, the frail and those with multiple 
comorbidities and limited life expectancy. Moreover, some patients may prefer 
not to undergo dialysis. Supportive care focused on symptom management and 
improving the quality of life is a legitimate treatment option in these 
situations. It can be delivered alongside dialysis or to patients who choose to 
receive only conservative care and is being increasingly recognised as an 
integral component of holistic kidney care. Kidney care provider ecosystem needs 
to become aware of the principles of the principles of shared decision making, 
advanced care planning, understanding how to provide emotional, spiritual and 
information support to the patient and their families and when needed 
bereavement care. Supportive care facilities are underdeveloped in most low 
resource settings including in India. There is a need to develop capacity in 
this area so that our patients can derive the benefit of the full range of 
treatment options for kidney disease.

India.

INTRODUCTION: The global burden of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is on the rise with 
advancing age, as life expectancy is improving worldwide. The literature shows a 
higher prevalence and incidence of KOA in women. The gender differences are seen 
not only in the developing world but also in the developed world. KOA at 
advanced stage can be quite disabling affecting the individuals' functioning 
capacity. The available treatment modalities can improve the quality of life 
significantly. The aim of this review is to study the gender differences in 
epidemiological and clinical aspects of KOA in Indian population.
METHODS: The keywords "knee osteoarthritis, Gender, India," "knee 
osteoarthritis, Sex, India," and "knee osteoarthritis, Prevalence, India" are 
used for data search for retrieving data from Indian studies in MEDLINE and 
Google Scholar. The broad inclusion criteria were clinical and radiological 
diagnosis of KOA, inclusive of both men and women and excluded articles with 
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, and secondary causes of arthritis.
RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were found to fulfill the broad inclusive 
criteria. Majority of the articles were cross-sectional prevalence studies 
either done in a community setup or in tertiary care hospitals. The overall 
prevalence of KOA in these studies ranges from 27.1% to 66.1%, depending on the 
lower age limit of the study population. Postmenopausal women are affected more 
than premenopausal women. High body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
and osteoporosis were the common comorbid conditions.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: The gender difference in the incidence and prevalence 
is seen in several cross-sectional studies and case series in the Indian 
literature. However, there is a paucity of data on clinical presentation, 
progression of the diseases, disability scoring at various stages of the KOA, 
and management.

Artificial finger joint design has been developed through different stages 
through the past. PIP (proximal interphalangeal) and MCP (metacarpophalangeal) 
artificial finger joints have come to replace the amputation and arthrodesis 
options; although, these artificial joints are still facing challenges related 
to reactive tissues, reduced range of motion, and flexion and extension 
deficits. Swanson silicone artificial finger joints are still common due to the 
physician's preferability of silicone with the dorsal approach during operation. 
Nevertheless, other artificial finger joints such as the pyrocarbon implant 
arthroplasty have also drawn the interests of practitioners. Artificial finger 
joint has been classified under three major categories which are constrained, 
unconstrained, and linked design. There are also challenges such as concerns of 
infections and articular cartilage necrosis associated with attempted retention 
of vascularity. In addition, one of the main challenges facing the silicone 
artificial finger joints is the fracture occurring at the distal stem with the 
hinge. The aim of this paper is to review the different artificial finger joints 
in one paper as there are few old review papers about them. Further studies need 
to be done to develop the design and materials of the pyrocarbon and silicone 
implants to increase the range of motion associated with them and the fatigue 
life of the silicone implants.

Prostatic Artery Embolization for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Health 
Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Wang M, Holubowich C, Cheng L, Falk L, Li C, Wells D.

BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of 
the prostate that commonly affects older people with prostates and may lead to 
obstructive urinary symptoms. Symptoms may initially be mild but tend to worsen 
over time. Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is an endovascular procedure to 
treat BPH, wherein an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into the 
patient to inject tiny particles intended to reduce blood flow to the enlarged 
prostate, causing it to shrink in size. We conducted a health technology 
assessment on PAE for people with BPH, which included an evaluation of 
effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 
PAE, and patient preferences and values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. 
We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Risk of Bias in 
Nonrandomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for observational 
studies. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic review of the economic 
literature. We then assessed the cost-effectiveness of PAE compared with 
alternative treatments (i.e., transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] or 
open simple prostatectomy [OSP]) using a Markov microsimulation model. The 
analysis was conducted from the Ontario Ministry of Health perspective over a 
time horizon of 6.5 years. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly 
funding PAE in people with moderate to severe BPH in Ontario.
RESULTS: We included six studies in our systematic review. Four RCTs and one 
observational study compared PAE with TURP, and one observational study compared 
PAE with OSP. All studies had considerable risk-of-bias concerns. PAE may 
improve BPH symptoms and urodynamic measures, but we are uncertain whether PAE 
achieves better results than TURP (GRADE: Very low to Low). Compared with TURP, 
PAE may result in higher patient satisfaction and fewer adverse events (GRADE: 
Not assessed). Compared with OSP, PAE may result in smaller improvements in BPH 
symptoms and urodynamic measures and may lead to fewer adverse events, but the 
evidence is very uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We did not find any published 
cost-effectiveness studies in the economic literature review. Our primary 
economic evaluation showed that, compared with TURP, PAE has an incremental cost 
of $328 (95% CrI: -$686 to $1,423) and a very small incremental quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) of 0.007 (95% CrI: -0.004 to 0.018). The resulting incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PAE versus TURP is $44,930 per QALY gained. 
At the commonly used willingness-to-pay values of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, 
the cost-effectiveness of PAE is uncertain (52% and 68% probability, 
respectively, of being cost-effective compared with TURP). In a scenario 
analysis, we compared PAE with OSP for individuals with large prostates (who may 
be ineligible for TURP). We found that PAE is less costly (-$1,231; 95% CrI: 
-$2,457 to $69) and less effective (-0.12 QALYs; 95% CrI: -0.18 to -0.04). The 
resulting ICER of PAE versus OSP is $10,241 saved per QALY lost. At the commonly 
used willingness-to-pay value of $50,000 per QALY, PAE is unlikely to be 
cost-effective (2% probability of being cost-effective compared with OSP). 
Assuming a low uptake (i.e., an additional 10 to 50 procedures per year in years 
1 to 5), we estimated that publicly funding PAE in Ontario would lead to an 
additional cost of about $11,400 over the next 5 years.People we spoke with who 
have lived experience with BPH reported on the negative impact it can have on 
their quality of life. Those who had received PAE reported a positive experience 
with the procedure and meaningful improvement in their symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostatic artery embolization may improve BPH symptoms and 
urodynamic measures, but we are uncertain if the procedure results in similar 
outcomes to those of TURP. Based on one observational study, PAE may result in 
smaller improvements compared with OSP, but we are very uncertain of the 
evidence. Compared with TURP and OSP, PAE may result in fewer adverse events. 
Longer-term comparative studies are needed to assess the durability and 
long-term adverse events of PAE, the potential need for reintervention after 
PAE, and how PAE compares with other available BPH treatment options.We found 
the cost-effectiveness of PAE compared with TURP to be uncertain. Also, PAE is 
unlikely to be cost-effective compared with OSP. If PAE is publicly funded in 
Ontario, the budget impact is estimated to be small over the next 5 years.People 
who have lived experience with BPH reported that PAE improves quality of life 
and reduces negative symptoms of BPH.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) diagnostic strategy requires 6 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). 
Point-of-care nucleic acid tests (POC NATs) are costlier, less sensitive, but 
more specific than RDTs.
METHODS: We simulated a 1-time screening process in Côte d'Ivoire (CI; 
undiagnosed prevalence: 1.8%), comparing WHO- and CI-recommended RDT-based 
strategies (RDT-WHO, RDT-CI) and an alternative: POC NAT to resolve RDT 
discordancy (NAT-Resolve). Costs included assays (RDT: $1.47; POC NAT: $27.92), 
antiretroviral therapy ($6-$22/month), and HIV care ($27-$38/month). We modeled 
2 sensitivity/specificity scenarios: high-performing (RDT: 99.9%/99.1%; POC NAT: 
95.0%/100.0%) and low-performing (RDT: 91.1%/82.9%; POC NAT: 93.3%/99.5%). 
Outcomes included true-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), true-negative (TN), 
or false-negative (FN) results; life expectancy; costs; and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs: $/year of life saved [YLS]; threshold 
≤$1720/YLS [per-capita gross domestic product]).
RESULTS: Model-projected impacts of misdiagnoses were 4.4 years lost (FN vs TP; 
range, 3.0-13.0 years) and a $5800 lifetime cost increase (FP vs TN; range, 
$590-$14 680). In the high-performing scenario, misdiagnoses/10 000 000 tested 
were lowest for NAT-Resolve vs RDT-based strategies (FN: 409 vs 413-429; FP: 14 
vs 21-28). Strategies had similar life expectancy (228 months) and lifetime 
costs ($220/person) among all tested; ICERs were $3450/YLS (RDT-CI vs RDT-WHO) 
and $120 910/YLS (NAT-Resolve vs RDT-CI). In the low-performing scenario, 
misdiagnoses were higher (FN: 22 845-30 357; FP: 83 724-112 702) and NAT-Resolve 
was cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: We projected substantial clinical and economic impacts of 
misdiagnoses. Using POC NAT to resolve RDT discordancy generated the fewest 
misdiagnoses and was not cost-effective in high-performing scenarios, but may be 
an important adjunct to existing RDT-based strategies in low-performing 
scenarios.

The internet has become an essential part of our daily life. But excessive usage 
can have a negative impact on the physical health of its users. Over the last 
decade, the use of Social Media (Facebook) has been increasing rapidly and the 
younger generations getting addicted to it. But all possible health impacts of 
excessive use of internet are yet to be thoroughly evaluated, especially in such 
a developing country as Bangladesh. The present study aims to understand 
possible health deteriorations from excessive use of Facebook in a cohort of 
university students of Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1186 
students from two public universities and 1472 from several private universities 
of Bangladesh using a comprehensive questionnaire. The data were analyzed using 
the chi-square test to understand the association between Facebook usage 
behaviors and physical health status. We found that ~70% of the students used 
the internet for at least 4-6 hours/day, and ~27% of them used Facebook for >3 
hrs. Students frequently use social media (mostly Facebook) for news and social 
communication. About 50% of the students reported wasting time on Facebook and 
going to sleep late because of it. Importantly, 47.3% students reported that 
excessive use of Facebook results sleeping disturbance and has a negative impact 
on the concentration of daily works/studies (p < 0.001). In addition, they 
experienced several other health problems, including worsening eyesight (71.2%), 
headaches (15.4%), back and neck pain (28%). Although not statistically 
important, a fair number of students sought medical attention due to the daily 
excessive use of internet (p-value = 0.112). These findings demands better 
understanding of the all possible impacts of using excessive internet among the 
University students, which can help take the necessary initiatives to encourage 
good use of the internet. Further extension of this study is suggested at all 
education levels to reveal the full scenario of degree of excessive internet use 
and its impact on the healths of Bangladeshi students.

Increased life expectancy for individuals with complex pediatric-onset 
conditions means most of this population survive into adulthood. While this is 
great news for individuals and their families, the traditional adult medical 
model must adapt to extend the care provided by specialty pediatric practices to 
primary care. In this paper, we introduce a model of integrated behavioral 
health (IBH) in a primary care practice for adults with childhood onset medical 
and developmental conditions. Our discussion includes the role of IBH providers 
(i.e., psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers) as members of the 
integrated team, patient engagement and response to treatment, and innovative 
ways we strive to meet patient needs. Our review of electronic health records of 
patients seen at the UR Medicine Complex Care Center suggest that IBH is 
feasible and highly utilized, with 216 patients (40%) having had contact with an 
IBH provider on the team at least once. We discuss the challenges of meeting the 
longer-term needs of this complex patient population and our directions for 
future growth including creating peer and caregiver support networks, expanding 
services offered, and continued collaboration with community partners.
