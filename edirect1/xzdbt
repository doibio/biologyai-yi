PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognize which are the elements that predict why a person is 
aging faster or slower and which intervention we can arrange to slow down the 
process, which permits to prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and 
disability.
RECENT FINDINGS: Aging is a complex process that leads to changes in all the 
systems of the body and all the functions of the person; however, aging develops 
at different rates in different people, and chronological age is not always 
consistent with biological age. Gerontologists are focused not only on finding 
the best theory able to explain aging but also on identifying one or more 
markers, which are able to describe aging processes. These biomarkers are 
necessary to better define the aging-related pathologies, manage multimorbidity, 
and improve the quality of life. The aim of this paper is to review the most 
recent evidence on aging biomarkers and the clusters related to them for 
personalization of treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Most evidence concerning aging ignores women's sexual orientation, 
yet sexual orientation-related discrimination across the life course may 
influence older lesbian and bisexual women's risk for poorer health. 
Understanding aging-well in this group is vital to development, testing, and 
implementation of evidence-based health promotion programming and services for 
aging sexual minority women.
METHOD: Data were from the Women's Health Initiative (N = 15,691; heterosexual n 
= 15,002, lesbian n = 440, bisexual n = 249) extension study. Multivariable 
linear and logistic regression tested associations between sexual orientation 
and indicators of successful, effective, and optimal aging-well in 
age-stratified groups of women (60-74 and 75+).
RESULTS: Lesbians aged 60-74 were more likely (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.16, 2.18) to report good self-mastery, more social 
support (b = 2.92, 95% CI, 1.99, 3.85), and greater likelihood of enjoying life 
(OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06, 2.01) compared with heterosexual women. Bisexual women 
aged 75+ reported increased personal growth (b = 1.09, 95% CI 0.23, 1.95) 
compared to heterosexuals. While lesbians aged 75+ had greater likelihood of 
living in a nursing home (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.01, 3.82) and were less likely to be 
happy at least most of the time (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99), they reported 
greater self-mastery (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06, 2.26) than their heterosexual peers.
DISCUSSION: Aging-well is not the same for all women. Health promotion programs 
may consider maximizing sexual minority women's internal and external 
resources-including social supports, self-mastery, and personal growth-to 
promote wellness in older age.

Do Criminals Live Faster Than Soldiers and Firefighters? : A Comparison of 
Biodemographic and Psychosocial Dimensions of Life History Theory.

A high risk of morbidity-mortality caused by a harsh and unpredictable 
environment is considered to be associated with a fast life history (LH) 
strategy, commonly linked with criminal behavior. However, offenders are not the 
only group with a high exposure to extrinsic morbidity-mortality. In the present 
study, we investigated the LH strategies employed by two groups of Polish men: 
incarcerated offenders (N = 84) as well as soldiers and firefighters (N = 117), 
whose professions involve an elevated risk of injury and premature death. The 
subjects were asked to complete the Mini-K (used as a psychosocial LH indicator) 
and a questionnaire which included a number of biodemographic LH variables. 
Although biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators should be closely linked 
with each other, the actual connection between them is unclear. Thus, this study 
was driven by two aims: comparing LH strategies in two groups of men with a high 
risk of premature morbidity-mortality and investigating the relationship between 
the biodemographic and psychosocial LH dimensions. The study showed that 
incarcerated men employed faster LH strategies than soldiers and firefighters, 
but only in relation to biodemographic variables (e.g., number of siblings, age 
of sexual initiation, life expectancy). No intergroup differences emerged 
regarding psychosocial LH indicators. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed 
a weak association between biodemographic and psychosocial LH indicators. The 
results strengthen the legitimacy of incorporating biodemographic LH traits into 
research models and indicate the need for further research on the accuracy of 
the Mini-K. The possible explanations for the intergroup differences in LH 
strategies are discussed.

    Neuron. 2020 Oct 14;108(1):5-7.

During development, endothelial tip cells (ETCs) located at the leading edge of 
growing vascular plexus guide angiogenic sprouts to target vessels, and thus, 
ETC pathfinding is fundamental for vascular pattern formation in organs, 
including the brain. However, mechanisms of ETC pathfinding remain largely 
unknown. Here, we report that Piezo1-mediated Ca2+ activities at primary 
branches of ETCs regulate branch dynamics to accomplish ETC pathfinding during 
zebrafish brain vascular development. ETC branches display spontaneous local 
Ca2+ transients, and high- and low-frequency Ca2+ transients cause branch 
retraction through calpain and branch extension through nitric oxide synthase, 
respectively. These Ca2+ transients are mainly mediated by Ca2+-permeable Piezo1 
channels, which can be activated by mechanical force, and mutating piezo1 
largely impairs ETC pathfinding and brain vascular patterning. These findings 
reveal that Piezo1 and downstream Ca2+ signaling act as molecular bases for ETC 
pathfinding and highlight a novel function of Piezo1 and Ca2+ in vascular 
development.

Intramedullary Spinal Cord Metastasis from Primary Lung Neuroendocrine 
Carcinoma: A Case Report and Operative Video.

BACKGROUND: Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) account for a minority 
of all spinal cord tumors. Rarely, symptoms from ISCM may be the initial 
presentation of an unknown primary carcinoma. Intramedullary metastasis from a 
second malignancy or from an unknown neuroendocrine malignancy is extremely rare 
and has never been reported in the literature. Because of the rarity of these 
tumors and the low volume of cases, well-defined treatment guidelines do not 
exist for the management of ISCM. Here we present a rare and one of the first 
reports of an intramedullary metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented 
with worsening bilateral lower extremity numbness for 2 months. Imaging revealed 
an intramedullary spinal cord tumor at the T4 level. The patient underwent 
microsurgical resection of the intramedullary spinal cord tumor. At operation, 
the tumor had an exophytic component. Subtotal resection was achieved. Pathology 
revealed a neuroendocrine metastasis, likely pulmonary in origin. She achieved 
partial resolution of neurologic symptoms at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendocrine ISCM are rare and lack well-defined treatment 
guidelines. Care should be individualized in these cases. Whenever feasible, 
surgical resection should be considered. Despite multidisciplinary care, the 
prognosis is dismal with limited life expectancy. Larger, multiinstitutional, or 
national database studies are needed that compare treatment modalities in the 
management of ISCM to identify the therapy with the best outcomes.

Failed treatment of intertrochanteric (IT) femoral fractures leads to remarkable 
disability and pain, and revision surgery is frequently accompanied by higher 
complication and reoperation rates than primary internal fixation or primary hip 
arthroplasty. There is an urgent need to establish a profound strategy for the 
effective surgical management of these fragile patients. Salvage options are 
determined according to patient physiological age, functional level, life 
expectancy, nonunion anatomical site, fracture pattern, remaining bone quality, 
bone stock, and hip joint competency. In physiologically young patients, care 
should be taken to preserve the vitality of the femoral head with salvage 
internal fixation; however, for the elderly population, conversion arthroplasty 
can result in early weight bearing and ambulation and eliminates the risks of 
delayed fracture healing. Technical challenges include a difficult surgical 
exposure, removal of broken implants, deformity correction, critical bone 
defects, poor bone quality, high perioperative fracture risk, and prolonged 
immobilization. Overall, the salvage of failed internal fixations of IT 
fractures with properly selected implants and profound techniques can lead to 
the formulation of valuable surgical strategies and provide patients with 
satisfactory clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: In many countries, future unrelated medical costs occurring during 
life-years gained are excluded from economic evaluation, and benefits of 
unrelated medical care are implicitly included, leading to life-extending 
interventions being disproportionately favored over quality of life-improving 
interventions. This article provides a standardized framework for the inclusion 
of future unrelated medical costs and demonstrates how this framework can be 
applied in England and Wales.
METHODS: Data sources are combined to construct estimates of per-capita National 
Health Service spending by age, sex, and time to death, and a framework is 
developed for adjusting these estimates for costs of related diseases. Using 
survival curves from 3 empirical examples illustrates how our estimates for 
unrelated National Health Service spending can be used to include unrelated 
medical costs in cost-effectiveness analysis and the impact depending on age, 
life-years gained, and baseline costs of the target group.
RESULTS: Our results show that including future unrelated medical costs is 
feasible and standardizable. Empirical examples show that this inclusion leads 
to an increase in the ICER of between 7% and 13%.
CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes to the methodology debate over unrelated 
costs and how to systematically include them in economic evaluation. Results 
show that it is both important and possible to include future unrelated medical 
costs.

Economic Evaluation of Interventions to Address Opioid Misuse: A Systematic 
Review of Methods Used in Simulation Modeling Studies.

Park, NC, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Several evidence-based interventions exist for people who misuse 
opioids, but there is limited guidance on optimal intervention selection. 
Economic evaluations using simulation modeling can guide the allocation of 
resources and help tackle the opioid crisis. This study reviews methods employed 
by economic evaluations using computer simulations to investigate the health and 
economic effects of interventions meant to address opioid misuse.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic mapping review of studies that used 
simulation modeling to support the economic evaluation of interventions 
targeting prevention, treatment, or management of opioid misuse or its direct 
consequences (ie, overdose). We searched 6 databases and extracted information 
on study population, interventions, costs, outcomes, and economic analysis and 
modeling approaches.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies 
considered only one segment of the continuum of care. Of the studies, 13 
evaluated medications for opioid use disorder, and 5 evaluated naloxone 
distribution programs to reduce overdose deaths. Most studies estimated 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years and used health system and/or 
societal perspectives. Models were decision trees (n = 4), Markov (n = 10) or 
semi-Markov models (n = 3), and microsimulations (n = 1). All of the studies 
assessed parameter uncertainty though deterministic and/or probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, 4 conducted formal calibration, only 2 assessed structural 
uncertainty, and only 1 conducted expected value of information analyses. Only 
10 studies conducted validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Future economic evaluations should consider synergies between 
interventions and examine combinations of interventions to inform optimal policy 
response. They should also more consistently conduct model validation and assess 
the value of further research.

Value of a QALY for France: A New Approach to Propose Acceptable Reference 
Values.

OBJECTIVE: France has included health economic assessment (HEA) as an official 
criterion for innovative drug pricing since 2013. Until now, no 
cost-effectiveness threshold (CET) has been officially proposed to qualify 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Although the French health 
authorities have publicly expressed the need for such reference values, previous 
initiatives to determine these have failed. The study aims to propose a locally 
adapted method for estimating a preference-based value for a quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) based on a rational approach to public policy choices in 
France.
METHODS: We used the official French value of statistical life (VSL) of €3 
million (USD 3.25 million), proposed in 2013 by the French General Commission on 
Strategy and Prediction. We first estimated the value of life-year (VoLY) by age 
category according to life expectancy and official discounts recommended for HEA 
in France. We then estimated a value of statistical QALY (VSQ) by weighting 
VoLYs with demographic data and French EQ-5D-3L tariffs.
RESULTS: The estimated average VoLYs and VSQs were €120 185 (USD 130 000) and 
€147 093 (USD 159 022), respectively, assuming a discount rate of 2.5% and €166 
205 (USD 179 681) and €201 398 (USD 217 728), respectively, assuming a discount 
rate of 4.5%.
CONCLUSION: Assuming that, as in other public domains, equity in access to 
healthcare across all disease areas and between all users is desirable, we 
propose an estimate of VSQ that is consistent with this goal. Our estimates of 
€147 093 (USD 179,681) to €201 398 (USD 217 728) should be perceived as 
breakeven costs for a QALY rather than a market access threshold. Such VSQs 
could be used as reference values for ICERs in HEA in France.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease 
caused by deletions or mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. An 
important hallmark of disease progression is the pathology of neuromuscular 
junctions (NMJs). Affected NMJs in the SMA context exhibit delayed maturation, 
impaired synaptic transmission, and loss of contact between motor neurons and 
skeletal muscle. Protection and maintenance of NMJs remains a focal point of 
therapeutic strategies to treat SMA, and the recent implication of the 
NMJ-organizer Agrin in SMA pathology suggests additional NMJ organizing 
molecules may contribute. DOK7 is an NMJ organizer that functions downstream of 
Agrin. The potential of DOK7 as a putative therapeutic target was demonstrated 
by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy delivery of DOK7 in 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Emery Dreyefuss Muscular Dystrophy 
(EDMD). To assess the potential of DOK7 as a disease modifier of SMA, we 
administered AAV-DOK7 to an intermediate mouse model of SMA. AAV9-DOK7 treatment 
conferred improvements in NMJ architecture and reduced muscle fiber atrophy. 
Additionally, these improvements resulted in a subtle reduction in phenotypic 
severity, evidenced by improved grip strength and an extension in survival. 
These findings reveal DOK7 is a novel modifier of SMA.

Aging Heads of State: The Politics of Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive 
Disorders.

Förstl H(1).

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy may explain why more elderly candidates 
appear to be running for office. This raises general questions regarding the 
specific risks of old age and frailty in demanding political positions. 
Therefore, I tried to give important contemporary examples of elderly leaders, 
study the mean age of leading political figures over the last 3 decades and 
present historical examples of heads of state with age-associated brain diseases 
and cognitive deficits. I reviewed the literature on mental illness and politics 
and analyzed the ages of international political leaders in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 
2020.
SUMMARY: There are several impressive contemporary examples of elderly 
politicians. The mean age of political leaders has not increased significantly 
in most parts of the world over the last 3 decades with the exception of the 
Gulf States and sub-Saharan Africa. Health problems of heads of state in earlier 
centuries had not been primarily age associated. After 1900, dementia but also 
mild cognitive and mild behavioral impairment became important issues in 
politically critical situations, for example international peace negotiations, 
the rise of Nazi Germany, the breakup of communism, the Arab Spring and others. 
Key Messages: This paper collects anecdotal evidence of cognitive frailty in 
ageing politicians; it is not an in-depth analysis of political history. 
Observations confirm that a very long time in power may obviously increase the 
risk of age-associated problems; dynamic revolutionary or entrepreneurial idols 
may be misled to rely on their irreplaceable charisma for too long. However, 
caution must be exercised against ageism on one side versus silent acquiescence 
towards leaders with failing mental powers on the other, who may become victims 
of obscure parties and their decompensating personality disorders.

Advances in cancer treatment helped in increasing the life expectancy of 
patients with cancer. However, a concomitant increase in the number of patients 
with bone metastases can be expected. A new multidisciplinary treatment strategy 
for patients with metastatic spinal tumors was designed, and has been practiced 
from 2013 in our hospital. The benefits of liaison treatment for metastatic 
spinal tumors is useful for early detection and early treatment before the 
collapse of the stabilization mechanism and the appearance of neurological 
symptoms, and enables team medical care by various experts. This system is a 
useful treatment for metastatic spinal tumors, because it enables radiotherapy 
and/or surgery before the onset of skeletal related events(SRE)and will also 
help maintain the activities of daily living(ADL)and quality of life(QOL)for 
patients with metastatic spinal tumors.

Often, co-medical staff are asked questions or consultations that are difficult 
to answer from cancer patients. However, as for the reply contents, each 
co-medical staff responded in various ways, there was no place to discuss an 
appropriate reply. At our hospital, we decided to hold a"Cancer Patient Response 
Conference"to enable us to respond appropriately regardless of years of service 
or occupation. This time, we investigated the effect of"Cancer Patient Response 
Conference"on the approach at Ishikiriseiki Hospital. As a result, it is 
possible for the co-medical staff to respond to empathy of the patient's 
feelings and to confirm the understanding of the patient, but it seemed that the 
response from the attending physician was good for the question about the life 
expectancy and the treatment effect etc. However, it was suggested that 
collaborative staff sharing patient problems and information at"Cancer Patient 
Response Conference"will be useful for future cancer patient response.

Objective: To examine whether we live healthier as we live longer in Hong Kong, 
which has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. Methods: Sullivan's 
method was used to evaluate the chronic disease-free life expectancy (CDFLE), 
life expectancy in good self-perceived health (GPHLE), and impairment-free life 
expectancy (IFLE) among population aged 50 years and older in Hong Kong in 
2007-2016. Results: In spite of the marked improvement in life expectancy in 
Hong Kong, the increase in GPHLE was much smaller, while CDFLE and IFLE even 
declined for both genders. The situation was more severe among older population. 
Discussion: People in Hong Kong live longer but with worsening health. The 
expansion of chronic diseases, self-perceived poor health, and impairments among 
older adults calls for more fiscal investments, government attention, and public 
health policies.

PURPOSE: To compare the odds of central neurodegenerative diseases in patients 
with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with the odds in patients without glaucoma 
(control patients).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older who visited Duke University 
Health System between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2015.
METHODS: An electronic query of patient records at Duke University Health System 
was performed to identify patients with and without diagnoses of OAG, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), vascular dementia (VD), senile dementia (SD), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and other neurodegenerative diseases. Univariate logistic 
regression analyses were performed to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR). Age 
group, race, and gender were included as covariates in multiple logistic 
regression analyses to calculate adjusted ORs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative 
disease in OAG patients with the odds in control patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1 511 602 patients were included in this study: 24 892 OAG 
patients and 1 484 790 control patients. Mean age was 58.9 ± 14.0 years for OAG 
patients and 44.9 ± 14.1 years for control patients. After adjusting for age, 
race, and gender, the OR comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative disease in 
OAG patients with the odds in control patients were as follows: for AD: adjusted 
OR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.93; for ALS: adjusted OR, 0.28; 
95% CI, 0.14-0.49); for PD: adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13; for VD: 
adjusted OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25; for SD: adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 
1.19-1.41; for MCI: adjusted OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.79-2.22; and for other 
neurodegenerative disease: adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.51-2.10.
CONCLUSIONS: Open-angle glaucoma patients may have increased odds of SD, MCI, 
and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further work is necessary to identify 
potential causal relationships. A negative correlation exists between OAG and 
ALS diagnosis that is likely related to limited life expectancy and physical 
limitations in ALS patients. A weak negative correlation exists between OAG and 
AD diagnosis. No correlation exists between OAG and PD or VD.

areas for health promotion?

The Roma or Gipsy population is the largest ethnic minority both in Europe and 
Hungary with a 10-15 years lower life expectancy and significantly worse health 
indicators than majority populations. The purpose of this exploratory study was 
to investigate a sensitive and controversial topic: the perspectives of 
healthcare staff about the presence and impacts of implicit bias in the 
Hungarian healthcare system towards Roma patients. Therefore, between June 2017 
and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare 
professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The 
presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted 
by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments 
or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a 
direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower 
quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, 
as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient 
refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced 
discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and 
cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between 
health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing 
anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role 
of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the 
Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues 
may be beneficial. Stress and burnout of healthcare professionals also need to 
be addressed as these may impact on the enactment of unconscious biases.

OBJECTIVE: To examine participants' experiences with nutrition education classes 
that were implemented with and designed to complement a cost-offset 
community-supported agriculture (CSA) programme.
DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of data from twenty-eight focus groups with 
ninety-six participants enrolled in Farm Fresh Foods for Healthy Kids (F3HK). 
Transcribed data were coded and analysed by a priori and emergent themes.
SETTING: Rural and micropolitan communities in New York, North Carolina, Vermont 
and Washington (USA).
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-six F3HK participants.
RESULTS: Participants found recipes and class activities helpful and reported 
improvements in nutrition knowledge, food preservation skills and home cooking 
behaviours for themselves and their children; they also reported that classes 
promoted a sense of community. Some educators better incorporated CSA produce 
into lessons, which participants reported as beneficial. Other obligations and 
class logistics were barriers to attendance; participants recommended that 
lessons be offered multiple times weekly at different times of day. Other 
suggestions included lengthening class duration to encourage social engagement; 
emphasising recipes to incorporate that week's CSA produce and pantry staples 
and offering additional strategies to incorporate children in classes.
CONCLUSION: Complementing a cost-offset CSA with nutrition education may enhance 
programme benefits to low-income families by improving nutrition knowledge and 
cooking behaviours. However, future interventions will benefit from ongoing 
coordination between educators and local growing trajectories to maximise timely 
coverage of unfamiliar produce in lessons; synchronous scheduling of CSA pick-up 
and classes for participant convenience and creative strategies to engage 
children and/or provide childcare.

BACKGROUND: Biofilm is known to be tolerant towards antibiotics and difficult to 
eradicate. Numerous studies have reported minimum biofilm eradication 
concentration (MBEC) values of antibiotics for many known biofilm pathogens. 
However, the experimental parameters applied in these studies differ 
considerably, and often the rationale behind the experimental design are not 
well described. This makes it difficult to compare the findings. To demonstrate 
the importance of experimental parameters, we investigated the influence of 
biofilm growth age, antibiotic concentration and treatment duration, and growth 
media on biofilm eradication. Additionally, OSTEOmycin™, a clinically used 
antibiotic containing allograft bone product, was tested for antibiofilm 
efficacy.
RESULTS: The commonly used Calgary biofilm device was used to grow 24 h and 72 h 
biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were treated 
with time-dependent vancomycin (up to 3000 mg L- 1) and concentration-dependent 
tobramycin (up to 80 mg L- 1), respectively. Two common bacteriological growth 
media, tryptic soy broth (TSB) and cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CaMHB), 
were tested. We found for both species that biofilms were more difficult to kill 
in TSB than in CaMHB. Furthermore, young biofilms (24 h) were easier to 
eradicate than old biofilms (72 h). In agreement with vancomycin being 
time-dependent, extension of the vancomycin exposure increased killing of S. 
aureus biofilms. Tobramycin treatment of 24 h P. aeruginosa biofilms was found 
concentration-dependent and time-independent, however, increasing killing was 
indicated for 72 h P. aeruginosa biofilms. Treatment with tobramycin containing 
OSTEOmycin T™ removed 72 h and 168 h P. aeruginosa biofilms after 1 day 
treatment, while few 72 h S. aureus biofilms survived after 2 days treatment 
with vancomycin containing OSTEOmycin V™.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated biofilm removal efficacy was influenced by 
media, biofilm age and antibiotic concentration and treatment duration. It is 
therefore necessary to taking these parameters into consideration when designing 
experiments. The results of OSTEOmycin™ products indicated that simple in vitro 
biofilm test could be used for initial screening of antibiofilm products. For 
clinical application, a more clinically relevant biofilm model for the specific 
biofilm infection in question should be developed to guide the amount of 
antibiotics used for local antibiofilm treatment.

COVID-19, the causative agent of which is a new type of coronavirus called 
SARS-CoV-2, has caused the most severe pandemic in the last 100 years. The 
condition is mainly respiratory, and up to 5% of patients develop critical 
illness, a situation that has put enormous pressure on the health systems of 
affected countries. A high demand for care has mainly been observed in intensive 
care units and critical care resources, which is why the need to redistribute 
resources in critical medicine emerged, with an emphasis on distributive 
justice, which establishes the provision of care to the largest number of people 
and saving the largest number of lives. One principle lies in allocating 
resources to patients with higher life expectancy. Mechanical ventilator has 
been assumed to be an indivisible asset; however, simultaneous mechanical 
ventilation to more than one patient with COVID-19 is technically possible. 
Ventilator sharing is not without risks, but the principles of beneficence, 
non-maleficence and justice prevail. According to distributive justice, being a 
divisible resource, mechanical ventilator can be shared; however, we should ask 
ourselves if this action is ethically correct.

mayor número de personas y salvar el mayor número de vidas. Un principio estriba 
en asignar los recursos a pacientes con mayores expectativas de vida. Se ha dado 
por hecho que el ventilador mecánico es un bien indivisible; sin embargo, 
técnicamente es posible la ventilación mecánica simultánea a más de un paciente

pero prevalecen los principios de beneficencia, no maleficencia y justicia. 
Conforme la justicia distributiva, al ser un bien divisible, el ventilador 
mecánico puede ser compartido, sin embargo, cabe preguntarse si esta acción es 
éticamente correcta.

The cervical thymic cyst (CTC) is a rare, benign neck mass that most commonly 
presents in the pediatric population. These entities can occur anywhere along 
the normal path of descent of the thymus from the mandible to the sternal notch, 
and extension into the mediastinum has been observed. The presentation of these 
masses is often characterized by a painless, enlarging neck mass in a child 
during the first decade of life. Although most patients are asymptomatic, 
abutment of the cyst against local structures has led to a variety of 
presentations including respiratory distress. These rare lesions are noted to 
have a male predominance and most commonly present on the left side of the neck. 
We present the rare case of a 19-year-old male who presented with a left-sided 
painless, cystic neck mass. He underwent a computed tomography scan of the neck 
which showed a large cystic mass in the left neck deep to the 
sternocleidomastoid muscle. Preoperatively, the diagnosis of an infected third 
branchial cyst was favored. The lesion was completely excised in the operating 
room. Final pathology was consistent with a CTC. The CTC is an uncommon benign 
process that often presents as an asymptomatic cystic neck mass. Knowledge of 
the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and treatment of these rare 
lesions is essential for the Otolaryngologist.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and gender 
differences in the benefits of educational attainment on cognitive health life 
expectancies among older adults in the United States.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Health and Retirement Study 
(1998-2014) to estimate Sullivan-based life tables of cognitively healthy, 
cognitively impaired/no dementia, and dementia life expectancies by gender for 
older White, Black, U.S.-born Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic adults with 
less than high school, high school, and some college or more.
RESULTS: White respondents lived a greater percentage of their remaining lives 
cognitively healthy than their minority Black or Hispanic counterparts, 
regardless of level of education. Among respondents with some college or more, 
versus less than high school, Black and U.S.-born Hispanic women exhibited the 
greatest increase (both 37 percentage points higher) in the proportion of total 
life expectancy spent cognitively healthy; whereas White women had the smallest 
increase (17 percentage points higher). For men, the difference between 
respondents with some college or more, versus less than high school, was 
greatest for Black men (35 percentage points higher) and was lowest for 
U.S.-born Hispanic men (21 percentage points higher).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results provide evidence that the benefits of 
education on cognitive health life expectancies are largest for Black men and 
women and U.S.-born Hispanic women. The combination of extended longevity and 
rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease points to the need for understanding 
why certain individuals spend an extended period of their lives with poor 
cognitive health.
