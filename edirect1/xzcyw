cancer in comparison with usual care.
DESIGN: Societal costs were collected alongside a cluster randomized controlled 
trial for 48 weeks. A total of 349 participants were included.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from oncology departments at 16 
participating hospitals in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and 
quality-adjusted life-years. Missing data were imputed using multiple 
imputation. Uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness 
planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show 
uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness estimates. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to check robustness of results.
RESULTS: Between treatment arms, no significant differences were found in 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (mean difference: -0.058; 95% 
confidence interval: -0.13 to 0.011), quality-adjusted life-years (mean 
difference: 0.042; 95% confidence interval: -0.015 to 0.099), and societal costs 
(mean difference: -1152; 95% confidence interval: -5058 to 2214). 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability of 
cost-effectiveness was 0.64 and 0.74 at willingness-to-pay values of €0 and 
€10,000 per point improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 
respectively. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective compared 
to usual care for quality-adjusted life-years was 0.64 and 0.79 at 
willingness-to-pay values of €0 and €20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The intervention is dominant over usual care, primarily due to lower 
costs in the intervention group. However, there were no statistically 
significant differences in clinical effects and the uptake of the intervention 
was quite low. Therefore, widespread implementation cannot be recommended.

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is one of the main causes of low back 
pain, which seriously reduces the quality of life of patients and places a heavy 
economic burden on their families. Cellular senescence is considered to be an 
important factor leading to IDD, and inflammatory response, oxidative stress, 
and mitochondrial dysfunction are closely related to intervertebral disc (IVD) 
senescence. Therefore, inhibition of the inflammatory response and oxidative 
stress, along with maintaining mitochondrial function, may be useful in treating 
IDD. The sirtuins are a family of evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylases, which are the major 
molecules mediating life extension or delay of aging-related diseases. The 
sirtuin protein family consist of seven members (SIRT1 - 7), which are mainly 
involved in various aging-related diseases by regulating inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and mitochondrial function. Among them, SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT6 
are closely related to IDD. In addition, some activators of sirtuin proteins, 
such as resveratrol, melatonin, magnolol, 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP), SRT1720, 
and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), have been evaluated in preclinical 
studies for their effects in preventing IDD. This review described the 
biological functions of sirtuins and the important roles of SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, 
and SIRT6 in IDD by regulating oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and 
mitochondrial function. In addition, we introduce the status of some sirtuin 
activators in IDD preclinical studies. This review will provide a background for 
further clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying IDD and the 
development of potential therapeutic drugs.

OBJECTIVE: Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis needs revascularization within 
2 weeks by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to reduce the risk of symptom 
recurrence; however, the optimal timing of intervention is yet to be defined in 
patients with large-volume cerebral ischemic lesion (LVCIL) and modified Rankin 
scale (mRS) score ≥3. The aim of this study was to determine the most 
appropriate timing for CEA in patients with a recent stroke and LVCIL.
METHODS: Data from patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis with LVCIL and mRS 
score of 3 or 4 from 2007 to 2017 were considered. Patients were submitted to 
CEA if they had a stable clinical condition and life expectancy >1 year. LVCIL 
was defined as a cerebral ischemic lesion of volume >4000 mm3. Perioperative 
stroke and death were evaluated by stratifying for timing of CEA by χ2 test and 
multiple logistic regression. Patients with similar characteristics (LVCIL and 
mRS score of 3 or 4) unfit for CEA served as the control group for recurrence of 
stroke at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: In an 11-year period, of a total 4020 CEAs, 126 (2.9%) were performed 
in patients with a moderate stroke and LVCIL occurring in the same admission. 
The patients' median age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 10 years); 72% 
(91) were male, with mRS score of 3 (IQR, 1) and LVCIL volume of 20,000 mm3 
(IQR, 47,000 mm3). The median time elapsed from symptoms to CEA was 7 weeks 
(IQR, 8 weeks). Overall perioperative stroke/death was 7.3% (eight strokes and 
one death). By selective timing evaluation of the postoperative events, CEA 
performed within 4 weeks was associated with a significantly higher rate of 
stroke/death compared with patients operated on after 4 weeks: 11.9% (8/67) vs 
1.7% (1/59; P = .03). By logistic regression, CEA within 4 weeks was an 
independent (from sex, cerebral ischemic lesion volume, dyslipidemia, and 
carotid stenosis) predictor of postoperative stroke/death (odds ratio, 8.2; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.01-73). In the same period, 101 patients were considered 
unfit for CEA for dementia (n = 22), severe comorbidities (n = 55), or short 
(<1-year) life expectancy (n = 24), and 43 (43%) survived at 1 year. At 1 year, 
the perioperative/recurrent stroke after CEA vs patients unfit for CEA was 
similar (6.2% vs 13.9%; P = .11), but CEA performed after 4 weeks led to 
significantly lower perioperative/recurrent stroke (1.7% vs 13.9%; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical risk of CEA in patients with a recent moderate-severe 
ischemic stroke and LVCIL is high. However, if the intervention is delayed 
>4 weeks, its benefit seems significant.

BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) present deficits of the active 
range of motion (ROM), prominently in their trunk. However, if these deficits 
are associated with axial rigidity, the functional mobility or health related 
quality of life (HRQoL), remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to study the 
relationship between axial ROM and axial rigidity, the functional mobility and 
HRQoL in patients with mild to moderate PD.
METHODS: An exploratory study was conducted. Non-probabilistic sampling of 
consecutive cases was used. Active trunk ROM was assessed by a universal 
goniometer. A Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the 
rigidity of the trunk. Functional mobility was determined by the Get Up and Go 
(GUG) test, and HRQoL was assessed with the PDQ-39 and EuroQol-5D 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: Thirty-six mild to moderate patients with PD were evaluated. 
Significant correlations were observed between trunk extensors rigidity and 
trunk flexion and extension ROM. Significant correlations were observed between 
trunk flexion, extension and rotation ROM and GUG. Moreover, significant 
correlations were observed between trunk ROM for flexion, extension and 
rotations (both sides) and PDQ-39 total score. However, these correlations were 
considered poor.
CONCLUSIONS: Trunk ROM for flexion and extension movements, measured by a 
universal goniometer, were correlated with axial extensors rigidity, evaluated 
by a technological device at 30°/s and 45°/s, and functional mobility. Moreover, 
trunk ROM for trunk flexion, extension and rotations were correlated with HRQoL 
in patients with mild to moderate PD.

BACKGROUND: Violence is a challenging modern epidemic worldwide. Less evidence 
is available on the populations most affected by violence in recent decades. The 
aim of the study was to ecologically investigate temporal trends of the global 
burden of violence according to gender, age group, and socio-demographic 
development.
METHODS: Data on the age- and gender-specific rates of country-level disability 
adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to different types of violence i.e. 
interpersonal violence (IV), and collective violence (CV) and legal 
interventions were retrieved from online database provided by the global burden 
of diseases project. Countries were categorized according to their 
socio-demographic index (SDI). Incidence rate ratio (IRR) per one year was 
estimated according to age groups, genders and SDI categories applying Poisson 
regression modeling.
RESULTS: The highest decrease of the DALYs attributable to IV was observed for 
the under-five-years age group and then for 5-14-years in both genders, 
globally. Considering the CV, estimated IRRs were significant only for the 
under-five-years age group, which was at 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.40, per 10 years) 
for girls and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.39, per 10 years) for boys.
CONCLUSION: The rate of DALYs due to IV has been more decreasing among women and 
children during the recent decades. By the next 10 years, the attributed DALYs 
to CV would increase up to 120%. Children, adolescents and women are highly 
affected by CV in countries with middle-low and middle social development in the 
recent decades.

OBJECTIVE: Increased life expectancy and exponential growth of adults suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide, has led to biomarkers incorporation for 
diagnosis in early stages. Use of neuropsychological testing remains limited. 
This study aimed to identify which neuropsychological tests best indicated 
underlying AD pathophysiology.
METHODS: One hundred and forty-one patients with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) 
were studied. A neuropsychological test battery based on the Uniform Data Set 
(UDS) from the Alzheimer's Disease Centers program of the National Institute on 
Aging (NIA) was performed and amyloid markers recorded; according to presence or 
absence of amyloid identified by positive PIB-PET findings, or low CSF Aβ42 
levels, patients were separated into MCI amyloid-(n:58) and MCI amyloid + 
(n = 83) cases.
RESULTS: Statistical differences were found in all memory tests between groups. 
Delayed recall score at thirty minutes on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(AVLT) was the best predictor of amyloid pathology presence (AUC 0.68), followed 
by AVLT total learning (AUC 0.66) and AVLT Recognition (AUC 0.59) scores, 
providing useful cut off values in the clinical setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of neuropsychological testing, specifically AVLT scores with 
cutoff values, contributed to the correct diagnosis of MCI due to AD in this 
SouthAmerican cohort.

BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a slow-growing, rarely lethal skin 
cancer that affects people 65 years or older. A range of treatment options exist 
for BCC, but there is little evidence available to guide patients and providers 
in selecting the best treatment options.
OBJECTIVES: This study outlines the development of a patient decision aid (PDA) 
for low-risk BCC that can be used by patients and providers to assist in shared 
decision-making.
METHODS: In accordance with the International Patient Decision Aids Standards 
(IPDAS) Collaboration framework, feedback from focus groups and semi-structured 
interviews with patients and providers, an initial prototype of the PDA was 
developed. This was tested using cognitive interviews and iteratively updated.
RESULTS: We created eighteen different iterations using feedback from 24 
patients and 34 providers. The key issues identified included: 1) Addressing 
fear of cancer; 2) Communicating risk and uncertainty; 3) Values clarification; 
and 4) Time lag to benefit.
LIMITATIONS: The PDA does not include all possible treatment options and is 
currently paper based.
CONCLUSIONS: Our PDA has been specifically adapted and designed to support 
patients with a limited life expectancy in making decisions about their low risk 
BCC together with their doctors.

BACKGROUND: There are many health benefits since 31 years after the foundation 
of the National Health Service (NHS) in Brazil, especially the increase in life 
expectancy. However, family-income inequalities, insufficient funding, and 
suboptimal private sector-public sector collaboration are still areas for 
improvement. The efforts of Brazil to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) 
for medicines have resulted in increased public financing of medicines and their 
availability, reducing avoidable hospitalization and mortality. However, lack of 
access to medicines still remains. Due to historical reasons, pharmaceutical 
service organization in developing countries may have important differences from 
high-income countries. In some cases, developing countries finance and promote 
medicine access by using the public infrastructure of health care/medical units 
as dispensing sites and cover all costs of medicines dispensed. In contrast, 
many high-income countries use private community pharmacies and cover the costs 
of medicines dispensed plus a fee, which includes all logistic costs. In this 
study, we will undertake an economic evaluation to understand the funding needs 
of the Brazilian NHS to reduce inequalities in access to medicines through 
adopting a pharmaceutical service organization similar to that seen in many 
high-income countries with hiring/accrediting private pharmacies.
METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation of a model to provide access to 
medicines within public funds based on a decision tree model with two 
alternative scenarios public pharmacies (NHS, state-owned facilities) versus 
private pharmacies (NHS, agreements). The analysis assumed the perspective of 
the NHS. We identified the types of resources consumed, the amount, and costs in 
both scenarios. We also performed a budget impact forecast to estimate the 
incremental funding required to reduce inequalities in access to essential 
medicines in Brazil.
FINDINGS: The model without rebates for medicines estimated an incremental cost 
of US$3.1 billion in purchasing power parity (PPP) but with an increase in the 
average availability of medicines from 65% to 90% for citizens across the 
country irrespective of family income. This amount places the NHS in a very good 
position to negotiate extensive rebates without the need for external reference 
pricing for government purchases. Forecast scenarios above 35% rebates place the 
alternative of hiring private pharmacies as dominant. Higher rebate rates are 
feasible and may lead to savings of more than US$1.3 billion per year (30%). The 
impact of incremental funding is related to medicine access improvement of 25% 
in the second year when paying by dispensing fee. The estimate of the 
incremental budget in five years would be US$4.8 billion PPP. We have yet to 
explore the potential reduction in hospital and outpatient costs, as well as in 
lawsuits, with increased availability with the yearly expenses for these at US$9 
billion and US$1.4 billion PPP respectively in 2017.
INTERPRETATION: The results of the economic evaluation demonstrate potential 
savings for the NHS and society. Achieving UHC for medicines reduces household 
expenses with health costs, health litigation, outpatient care, hospitalization, 
and mortality. An optimal private sector-public sector collaboration model with 
private community pharmacy accreditation is economically dominant with a 
feasible medicine price negotiation. The results show the potential to improve 
access to medicines by 25% for all income classes. This is most beneficial to 
the poorest families, whose medicines account for 76% of their total health 
expenses, with potential savings of lives and public resources.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that results in 
progressive muscular degeneration. Although medical advances increased their 
life expectancy, DMD individuals are still highly dependent on caregivers. 
Hand/wrist function is central for providing independence, and robotic 
exoskeletons are good candidates for effectively compensating for deteriorating 
functionality. Robotic hand exoskeletons require the accurate decoding of motor 
intention typically via surface electromyography (sEMG). Traditional low-density 
sEMG was used in the past to explore the muscular activations of individuals 
with DMD; however, it cannot provide high spatial resolution. This study 
characterized, for the first time, the forearm high-density (HD) electromyograms 
of three individuals with DMD while performing seven hand/wrist-related tasks 
and compared them to eight healthy individuals (all data available online). We 
looked into the spatial distribution of HD-sEMG patterns by using principal 
component analysis (PCA) and also assessed the repeatability and the amplitude 
distributions of muscle activity. Additionally, we used a machine learning 
approach to assess DMD individuals' potentials for myocontrol. Our analysis 
showed that although participants with DMD were able to repeat similar HD-sEMG 
patterns across gestures (similarly to healthy participants), a fewer number of 
electrodes was activated during their gestures compared to the healthy 
participants. Additionally, participants with DMD activated their muscles close 
to maximal contraction level (0.63 ± 0.23), whereas healthy participants had 
lower normalized activations (0.26 ± 0.2). Lastly, participants with DMD showed 
on average fewer PCs (3), explaining 90% of the complete gesture space than the 
healthy (5). However, the ability of the DMD participants to produce repeatable 
HD-sEMG patterns was unexpectedly comparable to that of healthy participants, 
and the same holds true for their offline myocontrol performance, disproving our 
hypothesis and suggesting a clear potential for the myocontrol of wearable 
exoskeletons. Our findings present evidence for the first time on how DMD leads 
to progressive alterations in hand/wrist motor control in DMD individuals 
compared to healthy. The better understanding of these alterations can lead to 
further developments for the intuitive and robust myoelectric control of active 
hand exoskeletons for individuals with DMD.

AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a health challenge in China, and the 
economic outcomes of lifestyle intervention are critically important for 
policymakers. This study estimates the lifetime economic outcomes of lifestyle 
intervention among the prediabetic population in the Chinese context.
METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
lifestyle intervention and no prevention in the prediabetic population. Efficacy 
and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the 
literature, which was assigned to model variables for estimating the 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs as well as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared with no prevention, lifestyle intervention averted 9.53% of 
T2DM, which translated into an additional 0.52 QALYs at a saved cost of $700 by 
substantially reducing the probabilities of macro- and microvascular diseases. 
This finding indicated that lifestyle intervention was a dominant strategy. The 
sensitivity analyses showed the model outputs were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle intervention is a very cost-effective alternative for 
prediabetic subjects and worth implementing in the Chinese healthcare system to

OBJECTIVE: Retrospective analysis of patients with periampullary tumors 
undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review included 48 patients with 
resectable periampullary tumors. Patients were divided into two groups according 
to the localization of cancer. Group 1 - pancreatic head tumors (n=27), group 2 
- tumors of major duodenal papilla (n=21). Survival was analyzed depending on 
chemotherapy and vascular resection. All patients underwent standard 
pancreatoduodenectomy with anastomosis on a single intestinal loop and D2 lymph 
node dissection.
RESULTS: Annual survival rate in patients with pancreatic head tumors was 
significantly higher compared with patients with tumors of major duodenal 
papilla (69.1% vs. 95.6%, p<0.05). Moreover, vascular resection (PV/SMV) was 
significant predictor of survival (p<0.01). There was a noticeable tendency to 
impaired survival if adjuvant chemotherapy was absent.
CONCLUSION: Pancreatoduodenectomy is preferred for periampullary tumors since 
this procedure significantly increases life expectancy. Postoperative adjuvant 
chemotherapy is recommended in all patients regardless histological data because 
combined approach is associated with improved survival.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Ретроспективный клинический анализ результатов 
лечения больных раком периампулярной зоны, перенесших 
гастропанкреатодуоденадьную резекцию (ГПДР).
МАТЕРИАЛЫ И МЕТОДЫ: В исследование включено 48 операбельных больных с 
аденокарциномой периампулярной зоны. Пациенты распределены по двум группам 
соответственно локализации опухоли: в 1-ю вошли 27 пациентов с раком головки 
поджелудочной железы, во 2-ю — 21 пациент с раком большого дуоденального сосочка 
двенадцатиперстной кишки. Исследована выживаемость пациентов в зависимости от 
проведенной химотерапии и резекции сосудов. Всем больным выполнена ГПДР с 
анастомозом на одной петле тощей кишки и с лимфодиссекцией в объеме D2.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Однолетняя выживаемость больных при раке головки поджелудочной 
железы составила 69,1%, при раке большого дуоденального сосочка — 95,6% 
(p<0,05). При резекции сосудов — воротной вены/верхней брыжеечной вены — 
выживаемость снизилась по сравнению с контрольной группой (p<0,01). Выявлена 
тенденция к снижению выживаемости больных без адъювантной химиотерапии (p<0,05).
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: ГПДР как радикальный метод лечения является операцией выбора для 
пациентов со злокачественными новообразованиями периампулярной зоны и позволяет 
существенно увеличить продолжительность их жизни.
После ГПДР всем больным независимо от результатов гистологического исследования 
хирургического края необходима адъювантная химиотерапия, которая увеличивает 
выживаемость.

Obesity prevalence continues to increase globally, leading to ill-health and 
reduced life expectancy in those affected and an urgent need for effective 
preventative and therapeutic strategies. Until recently obesity was viewed 
simplistically as an imbalance between energy expenditure and consumption that 
could be easily corrected by lifestyle changes. However, obesity is now 
recognized to be a chronic progressive disease, with bodyweight controlled by a 
complex interplay between the central nervous system, peripheral signals of 
energy balance from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, environmental 
food cues, and a powerful biological drive to defend the highest weight 
achieved. Currently, bariatric surgery represents the most effective treatment 
for people with severe obesity, leading to marked sustained weight loss as a 
consequence of altered eating behavior with improved health and life expectancy. 
Bariatric surgical procedures were initially envisaged to limit calorie intake 
by physically restricting food passage and inducing malabsorption. However, it 
is now clear that the success of bariatric surgery lies rather in the impact of 
these procedures on the biological regulation of energy homeostasis. In this 
review we summarize the complex bi-directional communication system known as the 
gut-brain axis with special focus on gut hormones, bile acids and gut 
microbiota. We discuss the impact of obesity, lifestyle interventions and 
bariatric surgery upon the gut-brain axis. Finally, we discuss the progress 
being made to pharmacologically mimic the beneficial hormonal milieu of 
bariatric surgery. For complete coverage of all related areas of Endocrinology,

Despite being one of the most common measures of development, the Human 
Development Index [HDI] has been much criticized for its consistency, data 
requirements, difficulty of interpretation and trade-offs between indicators. 
The 'Human Life Indicator' [HLI] has been proposed as a 'simple effective means' 
of measuring development and, more specifically, as a viable alternative to the 
HDI. Reducing inequalities within countries is a core component of the 
Sustainable Development Goals; yet sub-national HDIs are subject to the same 
criticisms as national level indices (potentially more so). Our goal in this 
paper is to demonstrate 'proof of concept' in terms of the systematic 
application of the HLI to measure development at the subnational level. Using 
life tables for the United States of America, we calculate, for the first time, 
HLIs for each state for the period 1959-2016. This country was chosen for the 
comparatively long run of available sub-national life tables. We also calculate 
the extent to which mortality is distributed across the life course-a further 
measure of inequality and the role of the social determinants of health. The HLI 
clearly shows how striking regional inequalities exist across the United States. 
We find that HLI and HDI for the most recent time period are strongly 
correlated. The analysis demonstrates that HLI represents an effective means of 
measuring development at the sub-national level. Compared to HDI, HLIs are 
characterized by simpler calculation and interpretation; fewer data 
requirements; less measurement error; more consistency over time; and no 
trade-offs between components. A current challenge of producing sub-national 
HLIs is the lack of comprehensive civil registration and vital statistics 
systems in many parts of the Global South from which sub-national life tables 
can be generated. However, as more and more countries develop these systems the 
potential to produce HLIs will inevitably increase.

BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling 
condition that may lead to functional impairment and reduced productivity. 
Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. 
The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of 
interventions for adults with PTSD.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 10 interventions and no treatment for 
adults with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and 
personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a 
systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were 
based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.
RESULTS: Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) appeared to be the 
most cost-effective intervention for adults with PTSD (with a probability of 
0.34 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
£20,000/QALY), followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies, self-help with 
support, psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 
trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), self-help without 
support, non-TF-CBT and combined TF-CBT/SSRIs. Counselling appeared to be less 
cost-effective than no treatment. TF-CBT had the largest evidence base.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of interventions appear to be cost-effective for the 
management of PTSD in adults. EMDR appears to be the most cost-effective amongst 
them. TF-CBT has the largest evidence base. There remains a need for 
well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of a range of treatments for adults with PTSD.

Disability-free life expectancy and life expectancy in good self-rated health in 
Chile: Gender differences and compression of morbidity between 2009 and 2016.

Author information:

Chile.

BACKGROUND: Chile has one of the highest life expectancies at 60 years in South 
America. This study was aimed to determine healthy life expectancies among 
Chilean older people, according to self-rated health and disability, and to 
explore gender differences.
METHODS: Data from the National Survey of Health (2009 and 2016) were used to 
estimate prevalence of less than good self-rated health and disability among 
people aged 60 years and above. Health expectancies were calculated with the 
Sullivan method.
RESULTS: In both years, women expected to live a lower proportion of their life 
expectancy in good self-rated health (54.5% [95% CI 50.0-58.8] for men and 37.6% 
[95% CI 34.3-40.8] for women in 2009; 46.1% [95% CI 42.6-49.7] for men and 38.5% 
[95% CI 35.6-41.4] for women in 2016). Life expectancy in less than good 
self-rated health increased for men (9.4 years [95% CI 8.4-10.3] in 2009; 11.5 
years [95% CI 10.7-12.2]). Women expected to live a lower proportion of their 
remaining life without disabilities (65.3% [95% CI 61.2-69.4] for men and 44.9% 
[95% CI 41.9-47.9] for women in 2009; 71.9% [95% CI 68.7-75.0] for men and 61.1% 
[95% CI 58.5-63.8] for women in 2016). In 2016, disability-free life expectancy 
increased among women, but they still had a higher life expectancy with mild 
disability (2.8 years [95% CI 2.3-3.4] for men and 6.0 years [95% CI 5.4-6.7] 
for women).
CONCLUSIONS: Women expected to spend more years in less than good self-rated 
health and disabled. There was an expansion of life expectancy in less than good 
SRH among men and a compression of disability in both sexes. The high proportion 
of years expected to be lived in less than good self-rated health and gender 
differences in disability-free life expectancy of older adults should be 
addressed by public health policies in Chile.

BACKGROUND: Asthmatic patients may benefit from exercise training, although the 
effects of a combined aerobic and resistance training program are still poorly 
investigated in children and adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of a combined exercise training (resistance 
and aerobic) program on aerobic fitness, lung function, asthma control and 
quality of life in a group of mild-moderate asthmatic children with exercise 
symptoms.
METHODS: This was a 12-week randomized controlled trial including children and 
adolescents diagnosed with mild-moderate asthma and presenting exercise-induced 
symptoms. The intervention group (IG) performed the exercise training 
(resistance and aerobic) 3 days/week, for 60 minutes. The control group (CG) 
followed routine clinical orientations. The main outcomes were cardiorespiratory 
fitness, muscle strength, lung function, quality of life, asthma control, and 
functional tests after 3 months of the intervention.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (IG = 25 and CG = 28) with a mean age of 
11.5 ± 2.6 years were included. No significant differences were found between 
groups regarding lung function, asthma control, quality of life, and functional 
tests. Ventilatory equivalent for oxygen consumption at ventilatory threshold 
(P = .025; ηp2  = 0.083), peak oxygen consumption (P = .008; ηp2  = 0.116) and 
test duration (P = .014; ηp2  = 0.1) presented greater improvements in the IG. 
In addition, improvements were observed in leg press (P < .001; ηp2  = 0.36), 
hamstring curl (P = .001; ηp2  = 0.217), high row (P = .003; ηp2  = .167), low 
row (P = .009; ηp2  = 0.128) and quadriceps leg extension (P = .015; ηp2 
 = 0.108) in the IG.
CONCLUSION: Combined exercise training (resistance and aerobic) improved 
cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in children and adolescents with 
controlled asthma and exercise symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the influence of toxic exposures on reduced 
life expectancy in First Nations people in Canada. The Grassy Narrows First 
Nation community have lived with the consequences of one of the worst 
environmental disasters in Canadian history. In the early 1960s, 10 000 kg of 
mercury (Hg) was released into their aquatic ecosystem. Although Hg 
concentration in fish, their dietary staple, decreased over time, it remains 
high. We aimed to examine whether elevated Hg exposure over time contributes to 
premature mortality (younger than 60 years) in this community.
METHODS: We did longitudinal and case-control analyses with data for individuals 
of the Grassy Narrows First Nation community. In 2019, the community obtained 
their historical Hg biomarker data from a government surveillance programme,
