in the most water-stressed areas of the Pacific Rim.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Although aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the 
preferred therapy for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), a substantial 
number of patients with indications for surgery do not undergo AVR. The study 
aim was to address, at multiple geographic locations and practice settings, the 
prevalence of unoperated patients with severe AS, and to explore potential 
barriers to intervention.
METHODS: The medical records at 10 centers of various size and geographic 
distribution were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with clinically 
severe AS (echocardiography/Doppler mean gradient > or = 40 mm Hg, effective 
orifice area < 1.0 cm2, or an overall interpretation of severe AS; and no 
clinical contradiction of severe AS). Demographic, clinical and outcomes data 
were recorded, including referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon (CTS), performance 
of AVR, and rationale when no AVR was performed.
RESULTS: Of 952 patients who met the criteria for clinically severe AS, 497 
(52%) were referred to a CTS for evaluation for AVR; subsequently, 395 patients 
(41%) underwent AVR and 557 (59%) were unoperated. Trends were similar across 
the institutions. Symptoms were present in 666 (79%) of 842 patients with 
available data, including 296 of 340 (87%) operated patients and 370 of 502 
(74%) unoperated patients. Those patients referred to a CTS were younger, more 
often male, had higher aortic valve gradients, and more often were symptomatic. 
The dominant reasons cited for not undergoing AVR were comorbidities or high 
operative risk, advanced age or limited life expectancy, asymptomatic status, 
and patient or family refusal. The one-year survival was 94 +/- 2% for operated 
patients, and 69 +/- 3% for unoperated patients (66 +/- 3% for unoperated 
symptomatic and 78 +/- 5% for unoperated asymptomatic patients).
CONCLUSION: In this multicenter survey, only about one-half of the patients with 
severe AS were referred to a CTS, and only about 40% underwent AVR. 
Three-quarters of unoperated patients were symptomatic. Referral to a CTS 
appeared more likely in the setting of symptoms of angina rather than heart 
failure or syncope, and elevated echocardiographic gradient rather than low 
valve area. Many patients who likely could benefit from AVR do not undergo 
evaluation for the condition, and similar observations were made at multiple 
medical institutions.

Conjugal bereavement effects on health and mortality at advanced ages.

van den Berg GJ(1), Lindeboom M, Portrait F.

Author information:

Netherlands.

Spousal bereavement at old ages may lead to dramatic changes in health. This 
paper investigates whether spousal bereavement has a causal effect on health and 
on mortality of the surviving spouse. We advance on the literature in two main 
ways. First, we model survivals of both spouses and the dynamic evolution of 
health jointly, allowing for potential endogeneity of timing of bereavement and 
health in explaining mortality of the surviving spouse. Second, we use a 
flexible non-parametric data dimensionality reduction method to thoroughly 
characterize health (using 22 health indicators) by a limited number of latent 
health indicators. This allows us to investigate the causal effect of spousal 
bereavement on mortality and on all aspects of health simultaneously. Our 
analyses are based on an ongoing longitudinal survey that follows a random 
sample of older individuals from 1992. We find strong instantaneous effects of 
bereavement on mortality and on certain aspects of health. Individuals lose on 
average 12% of residual life expectancy after conjugal bereavement. Conjugal 
bereavement affects the share of healthy years in residual lifetime, primarily 
because healthy years are replaced by years with chronic diseases. The strong 
direct effects of bereavement suggest that monitoring and/or interventions just 
after spousal bereavement are important for the length and quality of life of 
older bereaved individuals.

This qualitative study uses a phenomenological life world perspective to examine 
the utilization of nurses in community palliative care for people with noncancer 
conditions with a life expectancy of 2 years. Sited in Otago, New Zealand, while 
there was a number of health professionals involved in providing palliative care 
in the community for people with malignant conditions, none of the participants 
with nonmalignant disease were receiving specialist palliative care at the time 
of interview. Support services used a rehabilitative model of care that was not 
always appropriate in meeting the needs of the people who were dying and their 
families.

The cost-effectiveness of symptom-based testing and routine screening for acute 
HIV infection in men who have sex with men in the USA.

California, USA. jjuusola@stanford.edu

OBJECTIVE: Acute HIV infection often causes influenza-like illness (ILI) and is 
associated with high infectivity. We estimated the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of strategies to identify and treat acute HIV infection in 
men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA.
DESIGN: Dynamic model of HIV transmission and progression.
INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated three testing approaches: viral load testing for 
individuals with ILI, expanded screening with antibody testing, and expanded 
screening with antibody and viral load testing. We included treatment with 
antiretroviral therapy for individuals identified as acutely infected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: New HIV infections, discounted quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: At the present rate of HIV-antibody testing, we estimated that 538,000 
new infections will occur among MSM over the next 20 years. Expanding antibody 
screening coverage to 90% of MSM annually reduces new infections by 2.8% and 
costs US$ 12,582 per QALY gained. Symptom-based viral load testing with ILI is 
more expensive than expanded antibody screening, but is more effective and costs 
US$ 22,786 per QALY gained. Combining expanded antibody screening with 
symptom-based viral load testing prevents twice as many infections compared to 
expanded antibody screening alone, and costs US$ 29,923 per QALY gained. Adding 
viral load testing to all annual HIV tests costs more than US$ 100,000 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: Use of HIV viral load testing in MSM with ILI prevents more 
infections than does expanded annual antibody screening alone and is inexpensive 
relative to other screening interventions. Clinicians should consider 
symptom-based viral load testing in MSM, in addition to encouraging annual 
antibody screening.

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of intraperitoneal vincristine administration into 
ascitic sarcoma-180 bearing mice as a model of human malignant ascites regarding 
various peritoneal/retroperitoneal sarcomatosis, and to evaluate the 
flowcytometric telomerase reverse transcriptase expression for the diagnostic 
and prognostic purposes.
METHODS: Present study included disease induction by intraperitoneal homologous 
ascitic sarcoma-180 transplantation followed by in vivo intraperitoneal drug 
administration to study mitotic index, flowcytometric cell cycle and telomerase 
reverse transcriptase expression pattern, erythrosin-B dye exclusion study for 
malignant cell viability assessment. Besides, in vitro malignant ascite culture 
in presence and absence of vincristine sulfate and survival study were also 
taken into consideration.
RESULTS: Intraperitoneal vincristine administration (concentration 0.5 mg/kg 
body weight) significantly diminished the mitotic index in diseased subjects in 
comparison to untreated control subjects. Treated group of animals showed 
increased life span and median survival time. Cell viability assessment during 
the course of drug administration also revealed gradual depression on cell 
viability over time. Flowcytometric cell cycle analysis showed a good prognostic 
feature of chemotherapeutic administration schedule by representing high G2/M 
phase blocked cells along with reduced telomerase reverse transcriptase positive 
cells in treated animals.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that long term administration of vincristine sulfate in 
small doses could be a good pharmacological intervention in case of malignant 
peritoneal ascites due to sarcomatosis as it indirectly reduced the level of 
telomerase reverse transcriptase expression in malignant cells by directly 
regulating cell cycle and simultaneously increased the life expectancy of the 
diseased subjects.

Yoga and menopausal transition.

Vaze N(1), Joshi S.

Author information:
(1)Indian Menopause Society, Nagpur Chapter, NKPSIMS, Nagpur, India.

With increased life expectancy, today, women spend one-third of their life after 
menopause. Thus more attention is needed towards peri- and post-menopausal 
symptoms. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment, however, 
it has its own limitations. The present need is to explore new options for the 
management of menopausal symptoms. Yogic life style is a way of living which 
aims to improve the body, mind and day to day life of individuals. The most 
commonly performed Yoga practices are postures (asana), controlled breathing 
(pranayama), and meditation (dhyana). Yoga has been utilized as a therapeutic 
tool to achieve positive health and control and cure diseases. The exact 
mechanism as to how Yoga helps in various disease states is not known. There 
could be neuro-hormonal pathways with a selective effect in each pathological 
situation. There have been multiple studies that have combined the many aspects 
of Yoga into a general Yoga session in order to investigate its effects on 
menopausal symptoms. Integrated approach of Yoga therapy can improve hot flushes 
and night sweats. There is increasing evidence suggesting that even the 
short-term practice of Yoga can decrease both psychological and physiological 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies conclude that our age old 
therapy, Yoga, is fairly effective in managing menopausal symptoms.

Transnational caregiving: Part 1, caring for family relations across nations.

Dhar VE(1).

Author information:
(1)ericadhar@gmail.com

This article concerns how globalization and the aging of the world's population 
are affecting the already complex issue of intergenerational transnational 
caregiving. Globalization has caused an increase in workforce mobility with 
large numbers of individuals seeking employment overseas. This, coupled with 
increased longevity globally, has resulted in many workers leaving their elderly 
parents in need of care in their home countries. This has spawned caregiving 
across national borders, or caring for family relations across nations. 
Currently in the United States, not enough emphasis is given to family 
caregiving. Data compiled by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving 
estimate the economic value for this group of family caregivers in 2007 to be 
$375 billion, accounting for 34-52 million family caregivers per given year. 
This does not include those families who are transnational caregivers. The 
seminal work in this emerging field has been done by social anthropologists 
Loretta Baldassar, Cora Velekoop Baldock, and Raelene Wilding, who have defined 
the components of transnational caregiving based on an ethnographic study using 
qualitative data to study nine immigrant communities in Western Australia. 
Although their research focused on caregiving from a distance, additional work 
has been added to the discussion by introducing the element of "care drain" and 
further cultural perspectives. Therefore, this research is an exploratory study 
on intergenerational transnational caregiving within the context of the changing 
world and its demographics. Within the context of globalization and global 
aging, the following questions are addressed: What is the significance of family 
caregiving? What is a transnational? How has technology changed 
"transnationalism" today? What are the elements that comprise transnational 
caregiving? How does culture play a role in transnational caregiving? What are 
some of the national initiatives undertaken by governments to aid in workforce 
issues and recognition of caregiving organizations? By exploring these 
questions, it is hoped that there will be a better understanding of 
transnational caregiving and its relevance in all societies.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of office tasks on posture and 
movements in field settings, and the comfort rating for chair characteristics 
and correlation with type of task. The tasks studied were: computer work, 
telephoning, desk work and conversation. Postures, movements, chair part 
inclinations and comfort rating data were collected from 12 subjects. Computer 
work showed the lowest physical activity, together with upright trunk and head 
position and low backrest inclination. Conversation shows the highest activity 
of head legs and low back together with the highest cervical spine extension. In 
contrast, desk work provoked the most cervical spine flexion and showed the 
second lowest activity. The telephoning tasks showed medium activity and the 
highest kyphosis. Conversation showed the highest backrest inclination. Positive 
comfort relations were found for computer work and a "swing system" chair, for 
telephoning and an active longitudinal seat rotation, and for desk work and a 
chair with a three-dimensionally moveable seat.

Differences in health between Americans and Western Europeans: Effects on 
longevity and public finance.

In 1975, 50-year-old Americans could expect to live slightly longer than most of 
their Western European counterparts. By 2005, American life expectancy had 
fallen behind that of most Western European countries. We find that this growing 
longevity gap is primarily due to real declines in the health of near-elderly 
Americans, relative to their Western European peers. We use a microsimulation 
approach to project what US longevity would look like, if US health trends 
approximated those in Western Europe. The model implies that differences in 
health can explain most of the growing gap in remaining life expectancy. In 
addition, we quantify the public finance consequences of this deterioration in 
health. The model predicts that gradually moving American cohorts to the health 
status enjoyed by Western Europeans could save up to $1.1 trillion in discounted 
total health expenditures from 2004 to 2050.

Cost-effectiveness of tissue-type plasminogen activator in the 3- to 4.5-hour 
time window for acute ischemic stroke.

Tung CE(1), Win SS, Lansberg MG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School 
of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5235, USA. cetung@stanford.edu

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment in the 
3- to 4.5-hour time window after ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Decision-analytic and Markov state-transition models were created to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment of ischemic stroke patients with 
intravenous tPA administered in the 3- to 4.5-hour time window compared with 
medical therapy without tPA. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The economic outcome measure of the model was the difference 
in estimated healthcare costs between the 2 treatment alternatives. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the cost 
difference by the difference in QALYs. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic 
analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The administration of tPA compared with standard medical therapy 
resulted in a lifetime gain of 0.28 QALYs for an additional cost of $6050, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21 978 per QALY. One-way 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was most sensitive to the cost of hospitalization for patients who received tPA. 
Based on probabilistic analysis, there is an 88% probability that tPA is the 
preferred treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The balance of costs and benefits favors treatment with intravenous 
tPA in the 3- to 4.5-hour time window. This supports, from a societal 
perspective, the use of tPA therapy in this treatment time window for acute 
ischemic stroke.

[Intracranial metastasis of thymoma: report of three cases].

[Article in Japanese]

Thymoma with metastasis to the central nervous system is extremely rare. Herein, 
three rare cases of thymoma with intracranial metastasis are reported. Case 1 
(thymoma, B3 in the WHO classification); cranial magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) revealed a mass lesion with a ring enhancement effect in the right 
temporal lobe. The cystic and hemorrhagic lesion was subtotally removed and 
radiation therapy of 40 Gy was administered to the tumor cavity containing the 
remains of the tumor around the ependyma. The patient received combination 
chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride, and he was 
discharged 3 months after the operation. Case 2 [(thymoma, C (thymic 
carcinoma)]; multiple cerebral metastases of 8 lesions were found and whole 
brain irradiation of 40 Gy was performed. Three months later, rapid development 
of 2 metastatic lesions resulted in the patient's death. At autopsy, neoplastic 
lesions were found in the neck lymph node, right shoulder, chest frame, pleural 
cavity, diaphragm, lung, periaortic lymph node, liver and pancreas. Case 3 
(thymoma, B2); computed tomography (CT) scan and MRI showed a tumorous lesion 
over the cerebellar hemisphere. At operation, a vascular, elastic-soft and grey 
tumor was found to originate from the dura mater and had invaded the occipital 
bone. The tumor had also invaded the arachnoid membrane and sinus wall but the 
pia mater was free from invasion. Thereafter local irradiation of 40 Gy was 
performed to the tumor cavity containing the remains of the tumor around the 
sinus. However local recurrence reoccured 3 years later. After stereotactic 
irradiation of 40 Gy to the recurrent tumor, the tumor diminished. The patient 
is wheelchair-bound 3 years and 4 months after the operation. Most cerebral 
metastases are extremely rare. Outcome remains poor and life expectancy is very 
short when brain metastasis is present. Treatment for thymoma is multimodal, 
including surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy.

We present a case report of a severe treatment resistant major depressive 
episode in a patient with advanced cancer and limited life expectancy which 
resolved completely within 10 days of commencing combination therapy involving 
mirtazepine and paroxetine. Aggressive treatment of clinical depression even in 
the context of short life expectancy (that is, a short number of weeks) can 
dramatically reduce patient and family distress and improve quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate radiation exposure and evaluate 
the risks and benefits of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) in cancer screening.
METHODS: A nationwide survey of FDG-PET cancer screening was conducted in 2006, 
and the results were analyzed with a common index, "extension/shortening of the 
average life expectancy."
RESULTS: The average estimated effective dose was 4.4 mSv (male 4.7 mSv; female 
4.0 mSv) for dedicated PET and 13.5 mSv (male 14.2 mSv; female 12.8 mSv) for 
PET/computed tomography (CT). The risk-benefit break-even age from the viewpoint 
of radiation exposure was in the 40s for men and 30s for women for dedicated PET 
and in the 50s for men and 50s (variable injection dose) or 60s (constant 
injection dose) for women for PET/CT.
CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET cancer screening is beneficial for examinees above the 
break-even ages. The risks and benefits should be explained to examinees because 
of the larger radiation used in cancer FDG-PET screening compared with other 
X-ray tests.

PURPOSE: The Prostate CAncer gene 3 (PCA3) assay may guide prostate biopsy 
decisions and predict prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. This study explored 
the appropriateness of (1) PCA3 testing; (2) biopsy; (3) active surveillance 
(AS) and the value of the PCA3 Score for biopsy and AS decisions.
METHODS: Using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method, 12 urologists assessed the 
appropriateness of PCA3, biopsy and AS for theoretical patient profiles, 
constructed by combining clinical variables. They individually scored the 
appropriateness for all profiles using a 9-point scale. Based on the median 
score and extent of agreement, the appropriateness for each profile was 
calculated.
RESULTS: The PCA3 Assay was mainly considered appropriate in men with ≥1 
negative biopsy, PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL and life expectancy (LE) ≥10 years. A LE < 10 
years, ≥2 negative biopsies and PCA3 Score <20 decreased biopsy appropriateness, 
while PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL and PCA3 Score >50 increased it. In men without a prior 
biopsy, LE ≥ 10 years and a suspicious DRE, PCA3 did not affect biopsy 
appropriateness. In other men, a PCA3 Score <20 discouraged biopsy, while a 
value ≥35 supported biopsy. AS was mainly considered appropriate if LE < 10 
years, T1c PCa, ≤20% positive cores and PSA < 3 ng/mL. A PCA3 Score <20 pleads 
for and higher scores (particularly >50) against AS.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate in which men PCA3 can be of additional 
value when taking biopsy and treatment decisions in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a novel TNF-α inhibitor licensed to treat patients with 
active PsA. Although its clinical efficacy has been proven in clinical trials, 
its cost effectiveness is yet to be established.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of golimumab among patients with 
active PsA from the UK NHS perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate progression of a 
hypothetical cohort of active PsA patients on golimumab and other TNF-α 
inhibitors as well as palliative care. The clinical evidence was derived from 
clinical trials of TNF-α inhibitors and compared using mixed treatment models. 
The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated 
based on change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Psoriasis Area 
Severity Index (PASI) from baseline. The annual acquisition cost of golimumab 
was assumed to be identical to annual cost of other subcutaneous TNF-α 
inhibitors. The resource use costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% over a 
period of 40 years. The uncertainty surrounding important variables was further 
explored using probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: TNF-α inhibitors were significantly superior to palliative care but 
comparable to each other on Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), HAQ 
and PASI response. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for 
golimumab compared to palliative care was £16,811 for PsA patients and £16,245 
for a subgroup of PsA patients with significant psoriasis. At an acceptability 
threshold of £30,000 per QALY, the probability of golimumab being cost effective 
is 89%.
CONCLUSION: Once monthly, golimumab is a cost-effective treatment alternative 
for patients with active PsA. With its patient-focussed attributes, golimumab is 
likely to offer additional choice in PsA treatment.

Economic evaluation of healthcare interventions is becoming increasingly 
important and are seen by decision makers as a useful tool on how best to 
allocate scarce resources efficiently by maximising the health of the 
population. It is therefore important that health care professionals understand 
the fundamentals of an economic analysis so that they can understand, evaluate 
and critically appraise published economic evaluations. This article presents an 
introduction to the economic analysis of health care interventions and describes 
the basic concepts of an economic evaluation. The authors introduce the concept 
of efficiency to defend the use of economic tools to guide or help decisions in 
healthcare. The article presents the cost-effectiveness plane as a useful 
instrument when presenting the results of an economic evaluation, and summarises 
the main ways on how costs and outcomes are measured. To help readers understand 
the concepts presented in this introduction, we draw on published examples of 
economic analyses undertaken in the field of stroke.

Primary radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: 
a decision analysis.

Comment in
    Cancer. 2012 Jan 1;118(1):12-4.

BACKGROUND: Two evidence-based therapies exist for the treatment of high-risk 
prostate cancer (PCA): external-beam radiotherapy (RT) with hormone therapy (H) 
(RT + H) and radical prostatectomy (S) with adjuvant radiotherapy (S + RT). Each 
of these strategies is associated with different rates of local control, distant 
metastasis (DM), and toxicity. By using decision analysis, the authors of this 
report compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) between men with 
high-risk PCA who received RT + H versus S + RT versus a hypothetical 
trimodality therapy (S + RT + H).
METHODS: The authors developed a Markov model to describe lifetime health states 
after treatment for high-risk PCA. Probabilities and utilities were extrapolated 
from the literature. Toxicities after radiotherapy were based on 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy series, and patients were exposed to risks of 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fracture for 5 years after completing H. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to model 
uncertainty in outcome rates, toxicities, and utilities.
RESULTS: RT + H resulted in a higher QALE compared with S + RT over a wide range 
of assumptions, nearly always resulting in an increase of >1 quality-adjusted 
life year with outcomes highly sensitive to the risk of increased all-cause 
mortality from H. S + RT + H typically was superior to RT + H, albeit by small 
margins (<0.5 quality-adjusted life year), with results sensitive to assumptions 
about toxicity and radiotherapy efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: For men with high-risk PCA, RT + H was superior to S + RT, and the 
result was sensitive to the risk of all-cause mortality from H. Moreover, 
trimodality therapy may offer local and distant control benefits that lead to 
optimal outcomes in a meaningful population of men.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery for obesity: a review.

Glatt D(1), Sorenson T.

Author information:
(1)Sanford Surgical Associates, Sioux Fall, SD, USA.

The obesity epidemic in the United States is plaguing both the adult and 
pediatric population. As BMI increases, life expectancy drops. Metabolic and 
bariatric surgery can be an effective option for morbidly obese patients to 
enable substantial, sustained weight loss and result in improvement or 
resolution of comorbidities. The National Institutes of Health's criteria for 
bariatric surgery includes patients with a BMI of 35 and associated 
comorbidities, or a BMI of 40 and have failed conservative management. 
Currently, the common surgeries done in the United States are the laparoscopic 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, the 
biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and the sleeve gastrectomy. 
Complications of the surgery are related either to the stapling, origin of the 
surgery or the implantable device. Optimal outcomes for patients are achieved 
with a Center of Excellence designated surgeon and designated facility, 
demonstrated operative skill, quality outcomes, multidisciplinary support, 
minimal complications and number of procedures completed. Insurance companies 
have seen the benefit of covering metabolic and bariatric surgery with 
comorbidity reduction and reduced health care costs. A multidisciplinary 
approach to postoperative care includes a dietician, exercise physiologist, 
psychologist and bariatric nurse coordinator as part of the bariatric surgery 
team. Metabolic and bariatric surgery pared with healthy food choices and 
regular exercise is imperative to achieve the desired goal of long-term weight 
loss and comorbidity resolution.

Polypharmacy in the elderly: can comprehensive geriatric assessment reduce 
inappropriate medication use?

of Padova, Padova, Italy. giuseppe.sergi@unipd.it

Polypharmacy is a problem of growing interest in geriatrics with the increase in 
drug consumption in recent years, particularly among people aged >65 years. The 
main reasons for polypharmacy are longer life expectancy, co-morbidity and the 
implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. However, 
polypharmacy also has important negative consequences, such as a higher risk of 
adverse drug reactions and a decline in medication efficacy because of reduced 
compliance. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has proved effective in 
reducing the number of prescriptions and daily drug doses for patients by 
facilitating discontinuation of unnecessary or inappropriate medications. CGA 
has also demonstrated an ability to optimize treatment by increasing the number 
of drugs taken in cases where under-treatment has been identified. Greater 
multidimensional and multidisciplinary efforts are nonetheless needed to tackle 
polypharmacy-related problems in frail elderly patients. CGA should help 
geriatrics staff identify diseases with higher priority for treatment, thereby 
achieving better pharmacological treatment overall in elderly patients. The 
patient's prognosis should also be considered in the treatment prioritization 
process. The most appropriate medication regimen should combine existing 
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines with data gathered from CGA, 
including social and economic considerations. Furthermore, for prescriptions to 
remain appropriate, the elderly should periodically undergo medication review, 
particularly as the risk or presence of multiple co-morbidities increases. This 
article aims to highlight the increasing impact of polypharmacy in the elderly 
and to underscore the role of CGA in achieving the most appropriate 
pharmacological treatment in this age group.

Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. shk26@pitt.edu

BACKGROUND: Applying the chronic care model (CCM) for diabetes management helps 
improve health outcomes and patient care. The CCM was implemented at U.S. Air 
Force Wilford Hall Medical Center through the Diabetes Outreach Clinic (DOC) in 
2006, but its cost-effectiveness in this setting is unknown.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision model to estimate DOC 
cost-effectiveness compared with usual care (UC) over a 20-year period. Based on 
empirical, post-intervention demographic and clinical data, we applied United 
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk equations to predict long-term 
probabilities of developing microvascular or macrovascular complications. Health 
care system and societal perspectives were considered, discounting costs and 
benefits at 3% annually. Intervention costs and outcomes were obtained from 
military data, while other costs, disease progression data, and utilities were 
drawn from published literature.
RESULTS: From a health care system perspective, the DOC cost $45,495 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with UC; from a societal perspective, 
the DOC compared with UC cost $42,051/QALY (when the model started with the 
uncomplicated diabetes cohort), $61,243/QALY (when starting with the DOC 
cohort), or $61,813/QALY (when starting with the UC cohort). In one-way 
sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to yearly costs for specialty 
care visits. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the DOC was favored in 51% 
of model iterations using an acceptability threshold of $50,000/QALY and in 72% 
at a threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The DOC strategy for diabetes care, performed with the CCM 
methodology in a military population, appears to be economically reasonable 
compared with UC.

Does the expression of versican isoforms contribute to the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases?

Zhang ZW(1), Zhang JP, Zhou TT, Feng WH, Jiao BH.

University, Shanghai, PR China.

Classical neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's are most commonly seen in older persons. The incidence rate 
increases as life expectancy increases. Even though neuronal loss, neuronal 
death and accumulated toxic proteins are well investigated, the mechanism(s) of 
neurodegenerative disorders is not yet fully understood. Versican is a large 
extracellular matrix proteoglycan. Its isoforms are aberrantly expressed in 
central nervous system injuries. Diverse lines of evidence suggest that versican 
isoforms play a vital role in regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation, 
neurite outgrowth, and synaptic transmission. Some toxic proteins may be 
increased and less sensitive to degeneration due to the chondroitin sulfate (CS) 
chains of versicans. We propose that the patterns of versican V1 and V2 isoforms 
act as a fine-tuned mechanism for guiding the change of neural microenvironment, 
and the unbalanced expression of V1 and V2 isoforms may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The emergence of versican isoforms 
indicates that it may explain the pathogenesis of the common sporadic forms of 
complex diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro the pre-cementation resistance of CAD/CAM onlays 
subjected to functional occlusal tapping.
METHODS: An extracted tooth model (molar and premolar) with simulated bone and 
periodontal ligament was used to make a mesio-occlusal onlay preparation (two 
mesial cusps covered). Immediate dentin sealing was applied to the prepared 
tooth. The corresponding onlays were fabricated with Cerec either using 
composite resin (Paradigm MZ100) or ceramic (e.max CAD and Mark II) (n=14). An 
elevated marginal ridge was designed with the intention of generating 
hyper-occlusion. Pre-cementation occlusal tapping was simulated using 
closed-loop servo-hydraulics at 2 Hz, starting with a load of 40 N, followed by 
80, 120, 160, 200, 240 and 280 N (10 cycles each). All samples were loaded until 
fracture or to a maximum of 70 cycles. Groups were compared using the life table 
survival analysis (p=.016, Bonferroni method).
RESULTS: Survival probability was MZ100>e.max CAD>Mark II. The restorations made 
from e.max CAD and Mark II failed at an average load of 157 N and 123 N, 
respectively with no specimen withstanding all 70 load cycles (survival 0%); 
with MZ100 the survival rate was 36%.
SIGNIFICANCE: Material selection has a significant effect on the risk of CAD/CAM 
onlay fracture during pre-cementation functional occlusal tapping with composite 
resin onlays showing the minimum risk compared to ceramic ones.

Reducing protein synthesis slows growth and development but can increase adult 
life span. We demonstrate that knockdown of eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor 4G (eIF4G), which is downregulated during starvation and dauer state, 
results in differential translation of genes important for growth and longevity 
in C. elegans. Genome-wide mRNA translation state analysis showed that 
inhibition of IFG-1, the C. elegans ortholog of eIF4G, results in a relative 
increase in ribosomal loading and translation of stress response genes. Some of 
these genes are required for life span extension when IFG-1 is inhibited. 
Furthermore, enhanced ribosomal loading of certain mRNAs upon IFG-1 inhibition 
was correlated with increased mRNA length. This association was supported by 
changes in the proteome assayed via quantitative mass spectrometry. Our results 
suggest that IFG-1 mediates the antagonistic effects on growth and somatic 
maintenance by regulating mRNA translation of particular mRNAs based, in part, 
on transcript length.

Rheumatoid arthritis recapitulates events relevant in blastocyst implantation 
and embryogenesis: a pathogenetic theory.

OBJECTIVES: Theoretical considerations support the hypothesis that functionally 
relevant genes were not positively selected for symptomatic chronic inflammatory 
diseases (CIDs) because of 3 major reasons: 1) high negative selection pressure 
with loss of reproducibility; 2) no selection pressure at all (many CIDs of 
today manifest in higher ages, and due to low life expectancy of our ancestors, 
they did not suffer from CIDs that we know today); 3) there was no time for 
natural selection (various CIDs did not exist long enough). Nevertheless, genes 
can be transferred before outbreak of a CID and can confer an increased risk. 
However, these genes were positively selected for fitness in reproduction and 
survival at younger ages independent of a symptomatic CID (antagonistic 
pleiotropy). Thus, relevant genes were conserved for non-life-threatening 
inflammatory episodes (NOLTIES) such as infection or wound healing, which did 
not impede positive selection. Importantly, blastocyst implantation and 
embryogenesis are NOLTIES. We hypothesized that factors relevant in blastocyst 
implantation and embryogenesis are also found in active tissue inflammation of a 
CID.
METHODS: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was used as a paradigmatic CID. An extensive 
database search in PubMed and OMIM of the U.S. National Library of Medicine was 
conducted.
RESULTS: Many important similarities between RA and blastocyst 
implantation/embryogenesis were found including stem cell pathways, hormonal 
pathways, angiogenesis, neuronal pathways, the wingless (Wnt) pathway, the Notch 
pathway, the TGF-beta superfamily, matrix metalloproteinases, and others.
CONCLUSIONS: It turned out that many factors of RA inflammation were borrowed 
from the non-life-threatening episode of blastocyst implantation and 
embryogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the preference-based comparative effectiveness (human value 
gain) and the cost-utility (cost-effectiveness) of a telescope prosthesis 
(implantable miniature telescope) for the treatment of end-stage, age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD).
DESIGN: A value-based medicine, second-eye model, cost-utility analysis was 
performed to quantify the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
therapy with the telescope prosthesis.
PARTICIPANTS: Published, evidence-based data from the IMT002 Study Group 
clinical trial. Ophthalmic utilities were obtained from a validated cohort of 
>1000 patients with ocular diseases.
METHODS: Comparative effectiveness data were converted from visual acuity to
