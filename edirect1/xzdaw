less is known regarding gait joint kinematics under dual-task conditions in PD, 
specifically across multiple cognitive domains. The purpose of this project was 
to systematically characterize lower extremity joint kinematics in individuals 
with mild-moderate PD under dual-task paradigms across multiple cognitive 
domains.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease participated in this observational study evaluating hip, knee, and ankle 
joint kinematics while walking on a self-paced treadmill under dual-task 
conditions that taxed memory, attention, verbal fluency, and information 
processing.
RESULTS: Gait velocity and range of motion at the ankle, knee, and hip decreased 
(p < 0.05) under all of the dual-task conditions. Hip kinematics were affected 
to a greater extent than the ankle and knee, with reduction in flexion and 
extension during all timestamps of the gait cycle (p < 0.05) under all dual-task 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: The worsening of gait kinematics under dual-task conditions 
regardless of the aspect of cognition being challenged suggest that information 
processing and motor output are unable to withstand dual-task loads without 
consequence. These study results provide insight for target areas to focus on 
during therapeutic interventions in order to help minimize gait kinematic 
decrements observed under dual-task conditions.

The long-term mortality in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica 
(PMR) is unexpectedly decreased or at least not increased regardless of several 
mortality risk factors that these diseases share with other chronic 
immune-mediated rheumatic diseases. The genetic and immunological profile of 
PMR/GCA patients is unique, therefore, the hypothesis that this profile provides 
some survival advantage to PMR/GCA patients should be considered. The longevity 
is a phenomenon that was demonstrated to be familial. The familial aggregation 
of longevity can be studied by analysis of life expectancy in family members. 
Here we test the hypothesis of the aggregation of an increased longevity in the 
families of PMR/GCA patients. We compared the age of death of 358 parents of 179 
PMR and GCA patients with corresponding data retrieved from 506 parents of 253 
randomly collected age and sex-matched controls. The number of nonagenarian 
(≥ 90-year -old) mothers of PMR/GCA patients was significantly higher 
(OR = 2.34, 95%CI 1.11-11.95, p < 0.0005) vs controls. Both nonagenarian parents 
were found in 6 patients (3.35%) and none in the control cohort (OR = 8.77, 
95%CI 2.26-405.10, p = 0.003). Our data suggest the familial aggregation of 
nonagenarians in PMR/GCA patients.

Despite the high incidence of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), few studies 
show the effects of radiofrequency on pain and functionality in these patients. 
For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of 
monopolar dielectric diathermy by emission of radiofrequency (MDR) in dynamic 
applications aimed at treating pain and improving function in patients with 
PFPS. For this purpose, a single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted. 
Eighty-four participants with PFPS were evenly divided into an experimental 
group (EG) and a control group (CG). All subjects receive 10 min of daily home 
exercises along 3 weeks, and in addition, the subjects of the EG received 10 
sessions based on the dynamic application of MDR. Variables measured included 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), DN4 questionnaire, Lower Extremity Functionality 
Scale (LEFS), Kujala scale, Range of Movement (ROM) in knee flexion and 
extension and drug intake. The EG showed a statistically significant reduction 
in pain (VAS = 4.8 [5.5-4.1] [p < .001]; DN4 = 3.8 [4.4-3.2] [p < .001]), and an 
increase in functionality (LEFS = 16 [19-13] [p < .001]; Kujala = 19 [23-14] [p 
< .001]) and in ROM (flexion 18º [21º-16º] [p < .001]). No statistically 
significant changes in drug intake were found. Based on this data, the dynamic 
application of MDR seems effective in reducing pain and increasing functionality 
and flexion in patients with PFPS. Diathermy by emission of radiofrequency could 
be recommended as complement or main therapy in the treatment of PFPS.

BACKGROUND: Various combinations of tendon transfers are available for radial 
nerve palsy. However, the choice of which set of transfer to be performed in a 
patient remains an issue of varied opinions among surgeons. The study attempts 
to evaluate the results of various tendon transfers for radial nerve palsy 
quantitatively and subjectively. It also identifies which set of transfer is 
suitable for particular groups of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted between 2005 and 2007. A total of 
15 tendon transfers were performed using various combinations and evaluated 
according to Bincaz's criteria, Kapandji scale and effect of tendon transfers on 
activities of daily living.
RESULTS: 13 patients had excellent to fair outcome according to Bincaz's 
criteria. 2 patients had poor outcome. There was no hindrance in the activities 
of daily life in all patients. 93.4% of patients were satisfied with the 
results.
CONCLUSION: Every combination of tendon transfers has its own set of merits and 
demerits. Selection of donor tendons as per occupational need of patients is 
utmost important. Patients in our series were satisfied with set of transfers 
using Pronator teres(PT) for wrist extension, Flexor carpi radialis (FCR) for 
finger extension and rerouted Palmaris longus (PL) for extension of thumb. 
Flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) is important for power grip.

Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

BACKGROUND: One of the most important issues in public policy and welfare state 
is health care. Poor management leads to the waste of resources, including 
money, human resources, facilities, and equipment.
AIMS: This paper seeks to answer the question of which eastern Mediterranean 
countries are more effective in allocating their health resources, and does 
Iran, in relation to those countries, have an effective health system.
METHODS: This study examined technical efficiency among eastern Mediterranean 
countries in 2018. Data were extracted from Global Health Observatory data World 
Health Organization. We applied input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 
models to estimate efficiency scores. Inputs are Physicians density per 10,000 
populations, Total hospital beds per 10,000 populations, Current expenditure on 
health, % of gross domestic product and outputs are infant survival rate and 
Life expectancy.
RESULTS: The most efficient health systems in the eastern Mediterranean were 
Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Tunisia and the 
United Arab Emirates. The inefficient countries are Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, 
Palestine and Saudi Arabia.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the efficient countries, one category of high-entry countries 
such as Bahrain and Qatar with high input especially in health expenditure had 
higher output. The second group of countries with lower inputs such as Iran and 
Morocco has been able to produce similar output with other countries. Also, 
inefficiency in countries such as Saudi Arabia can be attributed to this with 
higher input such as health expenditure has lower output such life expectancy 
and infant survival rate.

The aim of this study was to provide decision makers with an assessment of 
potential future health effects of interventions against overweight and obesity 
(OWOB). By means of the DYNAMO-HIA tool we conducted a health impact assessment 
simulating future prevented disease (ischemic heart disease (IHD), diabetes, 
stroke, and multi morbidity) incidence, prevalence and life expectancy (LE) 
related to a scenario where OWOB is reduced by 25% and a scenario where obesity 
is eliminated. The study covered projected number of persons living in 
Copenhagen, Denmark during year 2014-2040 (n 2040 = 742,129). Reducing the 
proportion of men/women with OWOB with 25% will increase population LE by 
2.4/1.2 months and at the same time decrease LE with diabetes by 3.1/2.2 months. 
As a result of eliminating obesity, total LE will increase by 6.0/3.6 months and 
LE with diabetes will decrease with 9.8/10.3 months for men/women. We found no 
important effects on LE with IHD and stroke. This illustrates that the positive 
effects of lowering OWOB levels on IHD and stroke incidence is offset due to 
increasing total LE. Although the population of Copenhagen is relatively lean, 
reducing obesity levels will result in significant benefits for population 
cardiometabolic health status and LE. Future public health prevention programs 
may use the results as reference data for potential impact of reductions in 
OWOB.

During a spaceflight, astronauts need to live in a spacecraft on orbit for a 
long time, and the relationship between humans and microorganisms in the closed 
environment of space is not the same as on the ground. The dynamic study of 
microorganisms in confined space shows that with the extension of the isolation 
time, harmful bacteria gradually accumulate. Monitoring and controlling 
microbial pollution in a confined environment system are very important for crew 
health and the sustainable operation of a space life support system. 
Culture-based assays have been used traditionally to assess the microbial loads 
in a spacecraft, and uncultured-based techniques are already under way according 
to the NASA global exploration roadmap. High-throughput sequencing technology 
has been used generally to study the communities of the environment and human on 
the ground and shows its broad prospects applied onboard. We here review the 
recent application of high-throughput sequencing on space microbiology and 
analyze its feasibility and potential as an on-orbit detection technology.

The challenges of glaucoma management are many: the disease is chronic, 
progressive, often asymptomatic, and very often, the quality of life and costs 
of treatment is unacceptable to the patient. This is true for both medical 
therapy and conventional glaucoma surgery. The choice of therapy, especially the 
transition from the former to the latter, is now being bridged by Minimally 
Invasive Glaucoma Surgeries (MIGS). Choosing from the several options now 
available in the surgical armamentarium requires a deeper understanding of the 
available modalities. This review aims to provide an overview of the 
decision-making process, keeping in mind age, type of glaucoma, life expectancy, 
socioeconomic status, patient expectations, and coexisting cataract.

Aim: To perform cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis 
(BIA) comparing stenting to standard medical treatment (SMT) for the management 
of deep venous outflow obstruction and leg ulcers from the Italian Healthcare 
Service perspective. Materials & methods: A Markov model was developed to 
project costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 3 years, based on 
data from literature combined with real-world data. Moreover, a BIA was 
performed comparing the current scenario (100% SMT) with increasing utilization 
rates of stenting over SMT from 0.5 to 5%, in the next 5 years. Results: 
Stenting is a cost-effective (incremental cost-utility ratio €12,388/QALY) or 
dominant option versus SMT, according to in-patient or day-hospital settings, 
respectively. Increasing use of stenting over SMT, in the next 5 years, is 
expected to yield additional costs of 39.5 million Euros (in-patient) or savings 
of 5.1 million Euros (day-hospital). Conclusion: Stenting is a cost-effective 
option compared with SMT for patients with deep vein occlusion and ulceration in 
Italy.

Background: There is increasing interest in complementary approaches such as Tai 
Chi (TC) and Qi Gong (QG) in oncology settings. We explored the effects of TC/QG 
delivered in group classes at a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: Patients 
and caregivers who participated in TC or QG completed assessments before and 
after an in-person group class. Assessments included questions about 
expectancy/satisfaction and common cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
Scale [ESAS]). ESAS distress subscales analyzed included global (GDS), physical 
(PHS), and psychosocial (PSS). Results: Three hundred four participants (184 
patients, 120 caregivers) were included in the analysis. At baseline, caregivers 
had a greater expectancy for change in energy level as a result of class 
participation compared with patients (22.9% vs 9.9%). No significant difference 
was observed between baseline patient and caregiver PSS. Clinically significant 
improvement in well-being was observed among patients in TC classes (1.0) and 
caregivers in QG classes (1.2). For fatigue, patients (1.4) and caregivers (1.0) 
participating in QG experienced clinically significant improvement. Both TC and 
QG classes were associated with clinically significant improvements (ESAS GDS 
decrease ≥3) in global distress for patients (TC = 4.52, SD= 7.6; QG = 6.05, SD 
= 7.9) and caregivers (TC = 3.73, SD = 6.3; QG = 4.02, SD = 7.8). Eighty-nine 
percent of participants responded that their expectations were met. Conclusions: 
Patients and caregivers participating in TC or QG group classes were satisfied 
overall and experienced significant improvement in global distress. Additional 
research is warranted to explore the integration of TC and QG in the delivery of 
supportive cancer care.

Schizotypy denotes psychosis-like experiences, such as perceptual aberration, 
magical ideation, and social anxiety. Altered physiological arousal from social 
stress is found in people with high schizotypal traits. Two experiments aimed to 
determine the relationship of schizotypy to physiological arousal from social 
stress. Experiment 1 tested the hypotheses that heart rate from social stress 
would be greater in high, than mild-to-moderate, schizotypal traits, and 
disorganized schizotypy would explain this effect because of distress from 
disorganisation. Experiment 1 tested social stress in 16 participants with high 
schizotypal traits and 10 participants with mild-to-moderate schizotypal traits. 
The social stress test consisted of a public speech and an informal discussion 
with strangers. The high schizotypal group had a higher heart rate than the 
mild-to-moderate schizotypal group during the informal discussion with 
strangers, but not during the public speech. Disorganized schizotypy accounted 
for this group difference. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that 
mild-to-moderate schizotypal traits would have a linear relationship with 
physiological arousal from social stress. Experiment 2 tested 24 participants 
with mild-to-moderate schizotypal traits performing the abovementioned social 
stress test while their heart rate and skin conductance responses were measured. 
Mild-to-moderate schizotypal traits had a linear relationship with physiological 
arousal during the discussion with strangers. Distress in disorganized 
schizotypy may explain the heightened arousal from close social interaction with 
strangers in high schizotypy than mild-to-moderate schizotypy. Mild-to-moderate 
schizotypal traits may have a linear relationship with HR during close social 
interaction because of difficulty with acclimatizing to the social interaction.

children: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: Early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions are 
intensive interventions for autistic children that are often delivered on a 
one-to-one basis for 20-50 hours per week.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions for autistic 
children, based on current evidence.
METHODS: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis were 
conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an early intensive applied 
behaviour analysis-based intervention for autistic children. An economic 
analysis included a review of existing analyses and the development of a new 
model.
RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the clinical review. Individual 
participant data were retrieved from 15 of these studies. Results favoured the 
interventions when assessing adaptive behaviour after 2 years compared with 
treatment as usual/eclectic interventions (mean difference 7.00, 95% confidence 
interval 1.95 to 12.06). In analyses of cognitive ability (intelligence 
quotient), results favoured the interventions by approximately 10 points after 1 
year (mean difference 9.16, 95% confidence interval 4.38 to 13.93) and 2 years 
(mean difference 14.13, 95% confidence interval 9.16 to 19.10). Evidence for 
other outcomes was limited and meta-analyses were generally inconclusive. There 
was no evidence that the effect of the interventions varied with characteristics 
of the children, but data were limited. Adopting a £30,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year threshold, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate 
that early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions would need 
to generate larger benefits or cost savings to be cost-effective. Adopting a 
public sector perspective and making pessimistic assumptions about long-term 
effects, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for early intensive applied 
behaviour analysis-based therapy compared with treatment as usual is £189,122 
per quality-adjusted life-year. When optimistic assumptions are made, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is £46,768 per quality-adjusted life-year. 
Scenario analyses indicated that these interventions can potentially be 
cost-effective if long-term improvements persist into adulthood, or if they have 
significant impact on educational placement. Care should be taken when 
interpreting these scenarios owing to the limited data.
LIMITATIONS: All included studies were at risk of bias, there was substantial 
heterogeneity and effects varied considerably across studies. The effect of 
intervention on autism symptom severity, language development and school 
placement remains uncertain because of the limited data. The long-term effects 
are unclear owing to a lack of follow-up data.
CONCLUSIONS: This review found limited evidence that early intensive applied 
behaviour analysis-based interventions may improve cognitive ability and 
adaptive behaviour, but the long-term impact of the interventions remains 
unknown. The economic analysis is constrained by the limited effectiveness 
evidence, but suggests that these interventions are unlikely to be 
cost-effective unless clear long-term benefits, or a substantial change in which 
schools children attend, can be identified.
FUTURE WORK: Further studies into the effectiveness of early intensive applied 
behaviour analysis-based interventions may be warranted if they include 
well-defined, alternative interventions as comparators and collect relevant 
outcomes. Consideration should be given to future studies that not only address 
whether or not early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions 
are clinically effective, but also aim to identify which components of early 
intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions might drive 
effectiveness.

Plain Language Summary: Autism is a lifelong condition that affects how people 
understand the world and interact with others. Early intensive applied behaviour 
analysis-based interventions are an approach designed to help young (preschool) 
autistic children. This approach is often delivered on a one-to-one basis, for 
20–50 hours per week, over a period of several years. This project obtained and 
analysed the original data from studies of early intensive applied behaviour 
analysis-based interventions, to determine whether or not these interventions 
are beneficial. It also investigated whether or not the interventions represent 
good value for money. The results suggest that early intensive applied behaviour 
analysis-based interventions may improve children’s intelligence, communication, 
social and life skills more than standard approaches. However, some results 
could be inaccurate or incorrect, and there was no evidence about other 
important outcomes, such as the severity of autism and where children went to 
school. Most studies lasted for around 2 years, which means that it is not known 
if early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions have 
meaningful long-term benefits. It was not possible to fully assess whether or 
not these interventions provided value for money, as the benefits of early 
intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions were unclear, although 
the available evidence suggested that they did not. Early intensive applied 
behaviour analysis-based interventions may, however, provide value for money if 
their effects were to last into adulthood, or if receiving early intensive 
applied behaviour analysis had a large impact on the type of school children 
attended. Future studies of early interventions may be helpful, but should 
consider looking at which components of early applied behaviour analysis-based 
interventions are the most important, rather than at whether or not they work 
better than other interventions. Future studies should also follow best current 
research practice and evaluate outcomes that matter to autistic people and their 
families.

The world's population is ageing; however, the prolonged life expectancy is 
barely associated with an increase of healthy aging, and an important part of 
this demographic shift is a rising susceptibility to development and progressive 
accumulation of multiple chronic illness, challenging healthcare systems. Aging, 
therefore, represents the major risk factor for multimorbidity, a milestone for 
progressive loss of resilience and age-related multisystem homeostatic 
dysregulation. Cardiovascular risk factors, time and comorbidities play a 
vicious role in the development of heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, 
age itself is one of the most important risk factors for the development of 
cardiovascular disease and the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular 
disease in the elderly are significantly increased. Elderly subjects, 
particularly when frail and with comorbidities, however, are scarcely 
represented in primary and secondary prevention trial aimed to treat 
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. In 
particular, concerns exist about whether treatment should more or less intensive 
according to tolerability and risk of interactions; as well as there is 
uncertainty about therapeutic targets at different ages.This article reviews the 
relationship between ageing and cardiovascular disease, focusing on several 
issues regarding cardiovascular prevention in the elderly.

The purpose of this commentary is to outline a vision for the future of 
value-based healthcare in provinces across Canada and offer a few suggestions 
for the requirements to make substantial gains in value, based on learnings from 
past initiatives. We declare as our premise that improving value in healthcare 
means to improve population health. The goal of improving population health 
means to improve both average quality of life and life expectancy and to reduce 
inequalities in these health outcomes. That is, to "shift and squeeze" the 
population health distribution, as Dr. Patricia Martens phrased it in the Emmett 
Hall lecture at the Canadian Health Services and Policy Research conference in 
2014.

While pair-rule patterning has been observed in most insects examined, the 
orthologs of Drosophila pair-rule genes have shown divergent roles in insect 
segmentation. In the beetle Tribolium castaneum, while odd-skipped (Tc-odd) was 
expressed as a series of pair-rule stripes, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Tc-odd 
(Tc-oddRNAi) resulted in severely truncated, almost asegmental phenotypes rather 
than the classical pair-rule phenotypes observed in germbands and larval 
cuticles. However, considering that most segments arise later in germband stages 
of Tribolium development, the roles of Tc-odd in segmentation of growing 
germbands could not be analyzed properly in the truncated Tc-oddRNAi germbands. 
Here, we investigated the segmentation function of Tc-odd in germband stages of 
Tribolium development by analyzing Tc-oddRNAi embryos that resumed germband 
extension. In the larval cuticles of Tc-oddRNAi embryos, normal mandibular and 
maxillary and loss of the labial segments were consistent in the head, whereas a 
broad range of segmentation defects including loss or fusion of thoracic and/or 
abdominal segments was observed in the trunk. Interestingly, a group of 
Tc-oddRNAi germbands showed pair-rule-like defects in the segmental stripes of 
the segment-polarity genes, engrailed, hedgehog, or wingless, in the abdominal 
regions. While the pair-rule genes even-skipped, runt, odd, and paired were 
misregulated in the growing Tc-oddRNAi germbands, paired expression required for 
odd-numbered segment formation was largely abolished, which might cause the 
pair-rule-like defects. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tc-odd can 
function as a pair-rule gene in the germband stages of Tribolium development.

Leaf longevity and drought: avoidance of the costs and risks of early leaf 
abscission as inferred from the leaf carbon isotopic composition.

Plant species with longer leaf longevity tend to maintain lower photosynthetic 
rates. Among other factors, differences in stomatal limitation have been 
proposed to explain the negative effects of leaf longevity on photosynthesis, 
although it is not yet clear why stomatal limitations should be stronger in 
species with longer leaf longevity. We measured carbon isotopic composition 
(δ13C) in the fresh leaf litter of several Mediterranean woody species to 
estimate the mean stomatal limitations during the photosynthetically active part 
of the leaf life. Interspecific differences in δ13C were best explained by a 
multiple regression including, as independent variables, the maximum leaf 
longevity and the annual water deficit. For a similar level of water 
availability, stomatal limitations were higher in species with longer leaf 
longevity. We hypothesise that stronger stomatal control of transpiration in 
longer-living leaves arose as a mechanism to reduce the risk of leaf desiccation 
and to avoid the high costs for the future C assimilation of anticipated leaf 
mortality in species with a long leaf life expectancy. This stronger sensitivity 
to drought should be added to the suite of traits accompanying long leaf 
longevity and contributes decisively to the overall limitations to C 
assimilation in long-lived leaves.

Pseudo-reversion of the high-CO2 requiring phenotype of the NADH dehydrogenase 
type 1-impaired mutant of Synechocystis PCC6803, strain M55, by salt stress 
coincides with partial restoration of PSI-driven cyclic electron transfer. In 
M55, the complete family of D proteins (D1-D6) that are needed for electron 
transfer through the complex is lacking. Adaptation to salt stress requires de 
novo synthesis of full-length 47-kDa ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). A mutant 
created in the M55 background, which only expresses truncated chloroplast 37-kDa 
FNR cannot adapt to salt stress and refrains from growth in low CO2. A special 
feature of FNR in cyanobacteria is the relatively high molecular mass of 44-48 
kDa. A positively charged extended N-terminal domain of the cyanobacterial 
enzyme defines the extra mass. The extension likely plays a key role in the 
salt-stress inducible enhancement of PSI-driven cyclic electron transfer, and in 
the pseudo-reversion of the high-CO2 requiring phenotype of M55. Data acquired 
with several other cyanobacteria and the oxychlorobacterium Prochlorothrix 
hollandica contributed to the present hypothesis. It proposes that FNR is 
involved in regulation of inducible and transient PSI cyclic electron transfer 
in cyanobacteria via a thylakoid surface charge and conditional-proteolysis 
steered mechanism.

OBJECTIVE: Anemia is a major problem in developing countries, the purpose of the 
present study was to investigate the relationship between the human development 
index (HDI) and the prevalence of anemia among Asian women.
METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytic ecological study. The study analyzed 
data including HDI and prevalence of anemia extracted from the World Bank. The 
correlation coefficient and analysis of variance were used for data analysis. 
The significance level was considered to be less than 0.05. Analyses were 
performed using Stata-14 software.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the prevalence of anemia in women of 
reproductive age (R=-0.626, P<0.001), pregnant women (R=-0.576, P<0.001) and 
non-pregnant women (R=-0.623, P<0.0001) was significantly negatively correlated 
with HDI index. In the analysis of HDI components and the prevalence of anemia, 
a significant negative correlation was observed between the prevalence of anemia 
and the mean years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, and expected years of 
schooling indices in all 3 groups of women (non-pregnant, pregnant, and of 
reproductive age) (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Since there was a negative correlation between the prevalence of 
anemia in women and HDI, paying greater attention to factors which influence 
anemia may contribute to the prevention of anemia in developing countries.

Health-Related Quality of Life and Cost-Utility Analysis of Employees With 
Musculoskeletal Disorders Receiving Vocational Physiotherapy.

Chetty L(1).

Author information:
(1)Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust.

Background: The purpose of this project was to evaluate both health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and cost-utility associated with care for employees with 
musculoskeletal disorders who received vocational physiotherapy at a North 
London National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom. 
Methods: A pre- and post-physiotherapy EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire 
was administered to employees presenting to the vocational physiotherapy service 
(VPS) with musculoskeletal disorders. The cost-utility analysis of the 
physiotherapy service was calculated using cost data provided by VPS billing 
information and benefits measured using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). 
Findings: Overall, there was a significant improvement in the EQ-5D index from 
baseline to discharge in all HRQoL domains. The visual analog scale (VAS) 
improved from a mean of 31.5 (SD = 18.3) at baseline to 73.2 (SD = 18.5) at 
discharge. A cost-utility analysis indicated that the VPS would continue to be 
cost-effective until the cost per employee increased by 82.5%. 
Conclusion/Application to Practice: The project supports integration of 
vocational physiotherapy services into an occupational health department.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness models require quality of life utilities 
calculated from generic preference-based questionnaires, such as EQ-5D. We 
evaluated the performance of available algorithms for QLQ-C30 conversion into 
EQ-5D-3L based utilities in a metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patient 
population and subsequently developed a mCRC specific algorithm. Influence of 
mapping on cost-effectiveness was evaluated.
METHODS: Three available algorithms were compared with observed utilities from 
the CAIRO3 study. Six models were developed using 5-fold cross-validation: 
predicting EQ-5D-3L tariffs from QLQ-C30 functional scale scores, continuous 
QLQ-C30 scores or dummy levels with a random effects model (RE), a most likely 
probability method on EQ-5D-3L functional scale scores, a beta regression model 
on QLQ-C30 functional scale scores and a separate equations subgroup approach on 
QLQ-C30 functional scale scores. Performance was assessed, and algorithms were 
tested on incomplete QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Influence of utility mapping on 
incremental cost/QALY gained (ICER) was evaluated in an existing Dutch mCRC 
cost-effectiveness model.
RESULTS: The available algorithms yielded mean utilities of 1: 0.87 ± sd:0.14,2: 
0.81 ± 0.15 (both Dutch tariff) and 3: 0.81 ± sd:0.19. Algorithm 1 and 3 were 
significantly different from the mean observed utility (0.83 ± 0.17 with Dutch 
tariff, 0.80 ± 0.20 with U.K. tariff). All new models yielded predicted 
utilities drawing close to observed utilities; differences were not 
statistically significant. The existing algorithms resulted in an ICER 
difference of €10,140 less and €1765 more compared to the observed EQ-5D-3L 
based ICER (€168,048). The preferred newly developed algorithm was €5094 higher 
than the observed EQ-5D-3L based ICER. Disparity was explained by minimal 
diffences in incremental QALYs between models.
CONCLUSION: Available mapping algorithms sufficiently accurately predict 
utilities. With the commonly used statistical methods, we did not succeed in 
developping an improved mapping algorithm. Importantly, cost-effectiveness 
outcomes in this study were comparable to the original model outcomes between 
different mapping algorithms. Therefore, mapping can be an adequate solution for 
cost-effectiveness studies using either a previously designed and validated 
algorithm or an algorithm developed in this study.

BACKGROUND: Investigations of disease incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are valuable for facilitating preventive 
measures and health resource planning. We examined the tracheal, bronchus, and 
lung (TBL) cancer burdens worldwide according to sex, age, and social 
development index (SDI) at the global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: We assessed the TBL cancer burden using data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) database, including 21 regions, 195 countries, and territories in 
the diagnostic period 1990-2017. The data of TBL cancer-related mortality and 
DALYs attributable to all known risk factors were also analyzed. 
Age-standardized rates (ASRs) and their estimated annual percentage changes 
(EAPCs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Incident cases, deaths, and DALYs of TBL cancer increased worldwide 
(100.44%, 82.30%, and 61.27%, respectively). The age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR) was stable (EAPC = 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.03 to 0.08), 
but the age-standardized death (EAPC = - 0.34, 95%CI - 0.38 to - 0.3) and DALY 
rate decreased generally (EAPC = - 0.74, 95%CI - 0.8 to - 0.68). However, the 
change trend of ASIR and ASDR among sexes was on the contrary. China and the USA 
always had the highest incidence, mortality, and DALYs of TBL cancer. 
Significant positive correlations between ASRs and SDI were observed, especially 
among females. High (36.86%), high-middle (28.78%), and middle SDI quintiles 
(24.91%) carried the majority burden of TBL cancer. Tobacco remained the top 
cause of TBL cancer death and DALYs, followed by air pollution, the leading 
cause in the low-middle and low-SDI quintiles. Metabolic risk-related TBL cancer 
mortality and DALYs among females increased but was stable among males. The main 
ages of TBL cancer onset and death were > 50 years, and the DALYs concentrated 
in 50 - 69 years.
CONCLUSIONS: To significantly reduce the growing burden of TBL cancer, treatment 
resources need to be skewed according to factors such as risks and geography, 
especially for high-risk groups and high-burden areas. Asia had the greatest TBL 
cancer burden, followed by high-income North America. Tobacco remains the 
leading cause of death and DALYs, followed by air pollution. Effective 
prevention measures against tobacco and air pollution should be strengthened.
