optimization and extension of the target base pairs to allow more specific 
staining of telomeres. In the present study, we synthesized tandem tetramer 
polyamides composed of four hairpin moieties, targeting 24 bp in telomeric 
repeats, the longest reported binding site for synthetic, 
non-nucleic-acid-based, sequence-specific DNA-binding molecules. The novel 
tandem tetramers bound with a nanomolar dissociation constant to 24 bp sequences 
made up of four telomeric repeats. Fluorescently labeled tandem tetramer 
polyamide probes could visualize human telomeres in chemically fixed cells with 
lower background signals than polyamide probes reported previously, suggesting 
that they had higher specificity for telomeres. Furthermore, high-throughput 
sequencing of human genomic DNA pulled down by the biotin-labeled tandem 
tetramer polyamide probe confirmed its effective binding to telomeric repeats in 
the complex chromatinized genome.

INTRODUCTION: Congenital heart defects are frequently present in patients with 
Down syndrome.
AIM: The authors analyzed the impact of changing approach in surgical management 
of congenital heart defect on the life expectancy of patients with Down 
syndrome.
METHOD: Between 1974 and 1997 the data of 359 children with Down syndrome were 
collected. Among them 255 patients had no surgery and the mortality in this 
group was 25.9%, whereas the mortality in the group of 104 patients who 
underwent palliative surgery was 8.6%.
RESULTS: Surgical management of congenital heart defects provides the same life 
expectancy for these patients as compared to Down patients without cardiac 
defects. Primary reconstruction is the preferable surgical procedure in infancy 
that provides good results. Nowadays the number of the operated grown-up 
congenital heart disease patients with Down syndrome is increasing. During the 
last three years 82 grown-up congenital heart disease patients, including 4 
patients with Down syndrome (aged between 24 and 60 years) were reconstructed 
successfully.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the successful surgery in infancy the population of grown-up 
congenital heart disease patients with Down syndrome is increasing. The cardiac 
surgeons are ready to do everything for the optimal life expectancy of these 
patients. However, management of special problems (indication and necessity of 
reoperation, optimal age) in patients with Down syndrome poses a great challenge 
for cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(40), 1601-1603.

BACKGROUND: Older people with dementia are at increased risk of physical decline 
and falls. Balance and mood are significant predictors of falls in this 
population. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a tailored 
home-based exercise program in community-dwelling older people with dementia.
METHODS: Forty-two participants with mild to moderate dementia were recruited 
from routine health services. All participants were offered a six-month 
home-based, carer-enhanced, progressive, and individually tailored exercise 
program. Physical activity, quality of life, physical, and psychological 
assessments were administered at the beginning and end of the trial.
RESULTS: Of 33 participants (78.6%) who completed the six-month reassessment ten 
(30%) reported falls and six (18%) multiple falls during the follow-up period. 
At reassessment, participants had better balance (sway on floor and foam), 
reduced concern about falls, increased planned physical activity, but worse knee 
extension strength and no change in depression scores. The average adherence to 
the prescribed exercise sessions was 45% and 22 participants (52%) were still 
exercising at trial completion. Those who adhered to ≥70% of prescribed sessions 
had significantly better balance at reassessment compared with those who adhered 
to <70% of sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial of a tailored home-based exercise intervention presents 
preliminary evidence that this intervention can improve balance, concern about 
falls, and planned physical activity in community-dwelling older people with 
dementia. Future research should determine whether exercise interventions are 
effective in reducing falls and elucidate strategies for enhancing uptake and 
adherence in this population.

Octubre, Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Factors that impede closed reduction in intertrochanteric fractures 
remain unknown. This study was designed with the aim of establishing 
radiological variables that can predict an open reduction when nailing those 
type of fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational prospective study carried out between March 
2013 and March 2015. Patients of both gender who suffered an intertrochanteric 
fracture, and who were surgically treated by intramedullary nailing (PFN-A), 
were included. Patients were evaluated by means of a questionnaire designed in 
12 de Octubre Trauma department. Radiological parameters assessed 
preoperatively, after fracture reduction in the traction table, and after 
fixation were: calcar, lateral wall and posterior buttress integrity or 
disruption; lesser trochanter location, varus or valgus deformities, and flexion 
or extension of the proximal fragment.
RESULTS: Association between open reduction and the following types of fractures 
was statistically significant (p<0.001): subtypes A2.3, A3.2 and A3.3 of AO 
classification and subtypes IV and V of Evans classification. There were four 
radiological parameters associated with the need for open reduction: disruption 
of lateral wall (p<0.0000), posterior wall fracture (p<0.001), calcar (p<0.004) 
and malalignment in the axial view (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Open reduction seems to be necessary for complex fracture patterns 
such as A2.3, A3.2 and A3.3 types of AO/OTA classification, as well as types IV 
and V of Evans classification. There are four major radiological parameters that 
can predict the need of approaching the fracture site: posterior buttress, 
calcar disruption, lateral wall disruption and proximal fragment flexion. The 
development of high quality evidence regarding this topic is necessary due to 
the vast impact that open reduction can have on elderly patients.

Compensatory hyperhidrosis (HH) is the most common and feared side effect of 
thoracic sympathectomy, because patients with severe forms have their quality of 
life greatly impaired. The most well-known factors associated with compensatory 
HH are extension of manipulation of the sympathetic chain, level of sympathetic 
denervation, and body mass index. Technical developments as well as the proper 
selection of patients for surgery have been crucial in reducing the occurrence 
of severe forms of compensatory HH. Therapeutic options include topical agents, 
botulinum toxin, systemic anticholinergics, clip removal, and sympathetic chain 
reconstruction, although the efficacy is not well-established for all the 
methods.

INTRODUCTION: Hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an 
opportune time to counsel smokers to quit. Studies have demonstrated lower 
short-term mortality for counseled versus non-counseled smokers; yet, little is 
known about the long-term survival benefits of post-AMI smoking-cessation 
counseling (SCC).
METHODS: Data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a prospective cohort 
study of elderly patients with AMI between 1994 and 1996 with >17 years of 
follow-up, were used to evaluate the association of SCC with short- and 
long-term mortality in smokers with AMI. Life expectancy and years of potential 
life gained were used to quantify the long-term survival benefits of SCC. Cox 
proportional hazards models with exponential extrapolation were used to estimate 
life expectancy.
RESULTS: The analysis included 13,815 smokers, of whom 5,695 (41.2%) received 
SCC. Non-counseled smokers had higher crude mortality than counseled smokers 
over all 17 years of follow-up. After adjustment for patient and hospital 
characteristics, SCC was associated with a 22.6% lower 30-day mortality and a 
7.5% lower mortality over 17 years. These survival differences produced higher 
life expectancy estimates for counseled smokers than non-counseled smokers at 
all ages, which resulted in average gains in life years of 0.13 (95% CI=-0.31, 
0.56) to 0.58 (95% CI=0.25, 0.91) years, with the largest gains observed in 
older smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: SCC is associated with longer life expectancy and gains in life 
years in elderly smokers with AMI, supporting the importance of post-AMI 
counseling efforts.

A major obstacle to presymptomatic diagnosis and disease-modifying therapy for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is inadequate understanding of molecular mechanisms of 
AD pathogenesis. For example, impaired brain insulin signaling is an AD 
hallmark, but whether and how it might contribute to the synaptic dysfunction 
and neuron death that underlie memory and cognitive impairment has been 
mysterious. Neuron death in AD is often caused by cell cycle reentry (CCR) 
mediated by amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) and tau, the precursors of plaques and 
tangles. We now report that CCR results from AβO-induced activation of the 
protein kinase complex, mTORC1, at the plasma membrane and mTORC1-dependent tau 
phosphorylation, and that CCR can be prevented by insulin-stimulated activation 
of lysosomal mTORC1. AβOs were also shown previously to reduce neuronal insulin 
signaling. Our data therefore indicate that the decreased insulin signaling 
provoked by AβOs unleashes their toxic potential to cause neuronal CCR, and by 
extension, neuron death.

As human life expectancy rises, the aged population will increase. Aging is 
accompanied by changes in tissue structure, often resulting in functional 
decline. For example, aging within blood vessels contributes to a decrease in 
blood flow to important organs, potentially leading to organ atrophy and loss of 
function. In the central nervous system, cerebral vascular aging can lead to 
loss of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, eventually resulting in 
cognitive and sensorimotor decline. One of the major of types of cognitive 
dysfunction due to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is vascular cognitive 
impairment and dementia (VCID). In spite of recent progress in clinical and 
experimental VCID research, our understanding of vascular contributions to the 
pathogenesis of VCID is still very limited. In this review, we summarize recent 
findings on VCID, with a focus on vascular age-related pathologies and their 
contribution to the development of this condition.

Advancements in technology and medicine have led to a greater life expectancy 
and a corresponding increased interest in the mechanisms and prevention of 
aging. Because of its central role in human perception of age and emotion, the 
aging face generates a high demand for understanding the etiology of 
senescence-related changes. There are effective nonsurgical and surgical methods 
available for those seeking functional or cosmetic facial rejuvenation.

The increase of life expectancy in modern society has caused an increase in 
elderly population. Elderly people want to live independently in their home 
environment for as long as possible. However, as we age, our physical skills 
tend to worsen and our social circle tends to become smaller, something that 
often leads to a considerable decrease of both our physical and social 
activities. In this paper, we present an AAL framework developed within the 
SONOPA project, whose objective is to promote active ageing by combining a 
social network with information inferred using in-home sensors.

Tremendous breakthroughs are being made in cancer drug discovery and 
development. However, such breakthroughs come at a high financial cost. At a 
time when there is increasing pressure on drug pricing, in part because of 
increased life expectancy, it is more important than ever to drive new 
therapeutics towards patients as efficiently as possible. In this review we 
discuss the applications of molecular imaging in oncology drug development, with 
a focus on its ability to enable better early decision making, to increase 
efficiency and thereby to lower costs.

INTRODUCTION: Although stress echocardiography (SE) is invaluable in younger 
populations, its prognostic value may be attenuated in the elderly due to 
shorter life expectancy and the frequent presence of severe comorbidities. This 
study sought to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of SE in octogenarians, 
particularly its prognostic value over clinical variables, in predicting hard 
events.
METHODS: A total of 374 consecutive octogenarians who underwent SE for 
evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) were assessed for feasibility, 
diagnostic accuracy and safety of the test, and followed up for hard outcomes 
(all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) deaths and non-fatal myocardial 
infarction (NFMI)). Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictors 
of outcome.
RESULTS: Of the 374 tests, 360 (96.3%) were diagnostic. Of the 50 patients with 
inducible ischaemia, 33 patients (66%) proceeded to angiography of which 27 
(82%) patients had significant CAD. During long-term follow-up of 4.0±2.0 years, 
there were 127 deaths and 36 NFMIs. The annualised mortality, NFMI and combined 
mortality /NFMI rates were 8.1%, 1.8% and 9.4% for patients with a normal SE and 
12.1%, 5.5% and 14.1% for those with an abnormal SE, respectively. Predictors of 
NFMI on multivariate analysis were prior CAD (HR 2.89, CI 1.03 to 8.15, 
p=0.045), peripheral vascular disease (HR 3.33, CI 1.18 to 9.45, p=0.02), and 
inducible ischaemia (HR 3.97, CI 1.49 to 10.55, p=0.006). In patients without 
prior history of CAD, inducible ischaemia was the only independent predictor of 
NFMI (HR 8.72, CI 1.46 to 52.2, p=0.018). The larger the extent of ischaemia, 
the greater the incidence of NFMI. The independent predictors of CV events (NFMI 
or CV mortality) were PAD (HR 2.81, CI 1.21 to 6.52, p=0.016) and peak wall 
motion score index (HR 5.71, CI 1.67 to 19.6, p=0.006). Although inducible 
ischaemia predicted all-cause mortality on unadjusted analysis, it did not on 
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In octogenarians, SE demonstrated excellent feasibility, safety and 
diagnostic accuracy. SE parameters were independent predictors of NFMI and CV 
events, and the presence of inducible ischaemia was associated with a 50% 
increase in all-cause mortality.

StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domains are phospholipid- or sterol-binding 
modules that are present in many proteins. START domain-containing proteins 
(START proteins) play important functions in eukaryotic cells, including the 
redistribution of phospholipids to subcellular compartments and delivering 
sterols to the mitochondrion for steroid synthesis. How the activity of the 
START domain is regulated remains unknown for most of these proteins. The 
Plasmodium falciparum START protein PFA0210c (PF3D7_0104200) is a broad-spectrum 
phospholipid transfer protein that is conserved in all sequenced Plasmodium 
species and is most closely related to the mammalian START proteins STARD2 and 
STARD7. PFA0210c is unusual in that it contains a signal sequence and a PEXEL 
export motif that together mediate transfer of the protein from the parasite to 
the host erythrocyte. The protein also contains a C-terminal extension, which is 
very uncommon among mammalian START proteins. Whereas the biochemical properties 
of PFA0210c have been characterized, the function of the protein remains 
unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the unusual C-terminal extension 
negatively regulates phospholipid transfer activity. Furthermore, we use the 
genetically tractable Plasmodium knowlesi model and recently developed genetic 
technology in P. falciparum to show that the protein is essential for growth of 
the parasite during the clinically relevant asexual blood stage life cycle. 
Finally, we show that the regulation of phospholipid transfer by PFA0210c is 
required in vivo, and we identify a potential second regulatory domain. These 
findings provide insight into a novel mechanism of regulation of phospholipid 
transfer in vivo and may have important implications for the interaction of the 
malaria parasite with its host cell.

The life table data for the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), at 
different adult sex ratios (1♀: 1♂, 1♀: 50♂, 50♀: 1♂ free-choice mating, and 
50♀: 1♂ no-choice mating) were collected to determine the effects of sex-ratio 
manipulation on current pest control procedures. At 1♀: 1♂, females mated, on 
average, 2.3 times during their lifetime with a mean fecundity (F) of 1,122 
eggs. The net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite 
rate (λ), and mean generation time (T) were 561.0 offspring, 0.1693 d- 1, 1.1844 
d- 1, and 37.4 d, respectively. At 50♀: 1♂ free-choice mating, males mated 46.7 
times during their lifetime, while at 50♀: 1♂ no-choice mating, males mated on 
average 50 times during their lifetime, and all females mating only once in both 
treatments. The values for F, r, and λ were significantly lower for both 50♀: 1♂ 
treatments than those in the 1♀: 1♂ group; the R0 values, however, were either 
equal to or even higher than those in the 1♀: 1♂ treatment. In the male-biased 
sex ratio (1♀: 50♂), fecundity was the highest (1,610 eggs) and female average 
life span the longest (166 d), while the R0 was the lowest (31.6 offspring) 
among all treatments. Population projections showed that even at a sex ratio of 
50♀: 1♂, B. dorsalis could still produce a large number of offspring. These 
findings demonstrate that management strategies for controlling B. dorsalis 
could be properly evaluated by using demographic methods. Because female 
annihilation appears to be a more effective control strategy, it should be 
considered as a viable alternative.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled 
trial of a specialist physiotherapy intervention for functional motor symptoms 
(FMS).
METHODS: A randomised feasibility study was conducted recruiting patients with a 
clinically established diagnosis of FMS from a tertiary neurology clinic in 
London, UK. Participants were randomised to the intervention or a treatment as 
usual control. Measures of feasibility and clinical outcome were collected and 
assessed at 6 months.
RESULTS: 60 individuals were recruited over a 9-month period. Three withdrew, 
leaving 29 intervention and 28 controls participants in the final analysis. 32% 
of patients with FMS met the inclusion criteria, of which 90% enrolled. 
Acceptability of the intervention was high and there were no adverse events. At 
6 months, 72% of the intervention group rated their symptoms as improved, 
compared to 18% in the control group. There was a moderate to large treatment 
effect across a range of outcomes, including three of eight Short Form 36 (SF36) 
domains (d=0.46-0.79). The SF36 Physical function was found to be a suitable 
primary outcome measure for a future trial; adjusted mean difference 19.8 (95% 
CI 10.2 to 29.5). The additional quality adjusted life years (QALY) with 
intervention was 0.08 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.13), the mean incremental cost per QALY 
gained was £12 087.
CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrated high rates of recruitment, 
retention and acceptability. Clinical effect size was moderate to large with 
high probability of being cost-effective. A randomised controlled trial is 
needed.

Systemic mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the 
accumulation of neoplastic mast cells in the bone marrow and other organ 
organs/tissues. Mutations in KIT, most frequently KIT D816V, are detected in 
over 80% of all systemic mastocytosis patients. While most systemic mastocytosis 
patients suffer from an indolent disease variant, some present with more 
aggressive variants, collectively called "advanced systemic mastocytosis", which 
include aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with an 
associated hematologic, clonal non mast cell-lineage disease, and mast cell 
leukemia. Whereas patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis have a near 
normal life expectancy, patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis have a 
reduced life expectancy. Although cladribine and interferon-alpha are of benefit 
in a group of patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, no curative therapy 
is available for these patients except possible allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation. Recent studies have also revealed additional somatic 
defects (apart from mutations in KIT) in a majority of patients with advanced 
systemic mastocytosis. These include TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, RUNX1, JAK2, and/or RAS 
mutations, which may adversely impact prognosis and survival in particular 
systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm. In addition, 
several additional signaling molecules involved in the abnormal proliferation of 
mast cells in systemic mastocytosis have been identified. These advances have 
led to a better understanding of the biology of advanced systemic mastocytosis 
and to the development of new targeted treatment concepts. Herein, we review the 
biology and pathogenesis of advanced systemic mastocytosis, with a special focus 
on novel molecular findings as well as current and evolving therapeutic options.

7LD, UK.

AIMS: The aim of this to study was to compare the previously unreported 
long-term survival outcome of the Oxford medial unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty (UKA) performed by trainee surgeons and consultants.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We therefore identified a previously unreported cohort of 
1084 knees in 947 patients who had a UKA inserted for anteromedial knee 
arthritis by consultants and surgeons in training, at a tertiary arthroplasty 
centre and performed survival analysis on the group with revision as the 
endpoint.
RESULTS: The ten-year cumulative survival rate for revision or exchange of any 
part of the prosthetic components was 93.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 86.1 
to 100, number at risk 45). Consultant surgeons had a nine-year cumulative 
survival rate of 93.9% (95% CI 90.2 to 97.6, number at risk 16). Trainee 
surgeons had a cumulative nine-year survival rate of 93.0% (95% CI 90.3 to 95.7, 
number at risk 35). Although there was no differences in implant survival 
between consultants and trainees (p = 0.30), there was a difference in failure 
pattern whereby all re-operations performed for bearing dislocation (n = 7), 
occurred in the trainee group. This accounted for 0.6% of the entire cohort and 
15% of the re-operations.
CONCLUSION: This is the largest single series of the Oxford UKA ever reported 
and demonstrates that good results can be achieved by a heterogeneous group of 
surgeons, including trainees, if performed within a high-volume centre with 
considerable experience with the procedure. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 
2016;(10 Suppl B):22-7.

AIMS: Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, the Phase III Oxford 
Medial Partial Knee is used to treat anteromedial osteoarthritis (AMOA) in 
patients with an intact anterior cruciate ligament. This unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty (UKA) is relatively new in the United States, and therefore 
long-term American results are lacking.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single surgeon, retrospective study based on 
prospectively collected data, analysing a consecutive series of primary UKAs 
using the Phase III mobile-bearing Oxford Knee and Phase III instrumentation. 
Between July 2004 and December 2006, the senior author (RHE) carried out a 
medial UKA in 173 patients (213 knees) for anteromedial osteoarthritis or 
avascular necrosis (AVN). A total of 95 patients were men and 78 were women. 
Their mean age at surgery was 67 years (38 to 89) and mean body mass index 29.87 
kg/m2 (17 to 62). The mean follow-up was ten years (4 to 11).
RESULTS: Survivorship of the Oxford UKA at ten years was 88%, using life table 
analysis. Implant survivorship at ten years was 95%. The most common cause for 
revision was the progression of osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment. The 
mean knee score element of the American Knee Society Score (AKSS) was 50 
pre-operatively and increased to 93 post-operatively. The mean AKSS function 
score was 56 pre-operatively rising to 78 post-operatively CONCLUSION: This 
ten-year follow-up study of the Oxford UKA undertaken in the United States shows 
good survivorship and excellent function in a wide selection of patients with 
AMOA and AVN. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B(10 Suppl B):34-40.

Comment on
    Int J Health Policy Manag. 2015 Nov 06;5(1):1-3.

Daniels, Porteny and Urrutia et al make a good case for the idea that that 
public decisions ought to be made not only "in the light of" evidence but also 
"on the basis of" budget impact, financial protection and equity. Health 
technology assessment (HTA) should, they say, be accordingly expanded to 
consider matters additional to safety and cost-effectiveness. They also complain 
that most HTA reports fail to develop ethical arguments and generally do not 
even mention ethical issues. This comment argues that some of these defects are 
more apparent than real and are not inherent in HTA - as distinct from being 
common characteristics found in poorly conducted HTAs. More generally, HTA does 
not need "extension" since (1) ethical issues are already embedded in HTA 
processes, not least in their scoping phases, and (2) HTA processes are already 
sufficiently flexible to accommodate evidence about a wide range of factors, and 
will not need fundamental change in order to accommodate the new forms of 
decision-relevant evidence about distributional impact and financial protection 
that are now starting to emerge. HTA and related techniques are there to support 
decision-makers who have authority to make decisions. Analysts like us are there 
to support and advise them (and not to assume the responsibilities for which 
they, and not we, are accountable). The required quality in HTA then becomes its 
effectiveness as a means of addressing the issues of concern to decision-makers. 
What is also required is adherence by competent analysts to a standard template 
of good analytical practice. The competencies include not merely those of the 
usual disciplines (particularly biostatistics, cognitive psychology, health 
economics, epidemiology, and ethics) but also the imaginative and interpersonal 
skills for exploring the "real" question behind the decision-maker's brief 
(actual or postulated) and eliciting the social values that necessarily pervade 
the entire analysis. The product of such exploration defines the authoritative 
scope of an HTA.

Children, London, UK.

rFVIIIFc (efraloctocog alfa, Eloctate®) is an extended half-life (EHL) factor 
VIII licensed for use in patients with hemophilia A for prophylaxis and 
treatment of bleeding and surgical episodes. Pharmacokinetic studies in adults 
have shown a mean 1.5-fold increase in half-life compared to full-length factor 
VIII. When compared to adults, the half-life is decreased by 8% in adolescents 
between 12 and 17 years, by 18% in children 6 to <12 years, and by 33% in 
children between the ages of 2 and <6 years. There is a considerable 
interindividual variation in the prolongation of the half-life particularly in 
children and across the age groups, the range extending from no increase to a 
2.5-fold increase. In addition to age, von willebrand factor (VWF) antigen level 
has demonstrated a significant impact on rFVIIIFc half-life, with higher VWF 
levels associated with greater prolongation of half-life. The pivotal and 
pediatric clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of rFVIIIFc 
for use in regular prophylaxis and in management of bleeds and surgery. In these 
studies, just under half the participants showed a zero annualized bleed rate 
(ABR), and the median ABR (1.6 in the pivotal study for the individualized 
prophylaxis arm) showed a further decrease in the extension study. On average, 
the patients required fewer infusions (reduced by at least a third), and the 
mean weekly consumption seems to be in keeping with standard recombinant factor 
VIII. EHL rFVIIIFc has made decreased infusion frequency a possibility. However, 
the interindividual variability in dose and infusion frequency highlights the 
need for a personalized approach based on individual patient's half-life and/or 
response to treatment.

Solid cystic trigeminal schwannoma with intraorbital extension causing proptosis 
and vision loss.

Gupta P(1), Sharma A(1), Singh J(1).

Rajasthan, India.

Schwannomas are slowly growing, well capsulated, benign tumors. Involvement of 
vestibular nerve is most commonly followed by trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal 
schwannoma is rare entity, and cystic degeneration with intraorbital extension 
of trigeminal schwannoma is even rarer. These tumors occur in fourth and fifth 
decades of life and patients have variable presentation depending on which 
cranial compartment is involved. Orbital schwannoma usually presents with 
proptosis with or without vision loss. We are reporting such a rare case of 
solid cystic trigeminal schwannoma with intraorbital extension through superior 
orbital fissure that was removed surgically.

This paper discusses regression analysis of current status data, a type of 
failure time data where each study subject is observed only once, in the 
presence of dependent censoring. Furthermore, there may exist a cured subgroup, 
meaning that a proportion of study subjects are not susceptible to the failure 
event of interest. For the problem, we develop a sieve maximum likelihood 
estimation approach with the use of latent variables and Bernstein polynomials. 
For the determination of the proposed estimators, an EM algorithm is developed 
and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are established. Extensive 
simulation studies are conducted and indicate that the proposed method works 
well for practical situations. A motivating application from a tumorigenicity 
experiment is also provided.
