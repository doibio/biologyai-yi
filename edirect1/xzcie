mutant plants expressing various FLS2 C-terminal epitope fusions revealed highly 
variable and unpredictable FLS2-mediated signaling outputs. In addition, only 
one out of four FLS2 epitope fusions maintained the ability to inhibit plant 
growth in response to flg22 treatment comparable to that in the wild type or 
control untagged transgenic lines. These results raise concerns over the 
widespread use of RLK epitope tag fusions for functional studies. Many of the 
subtleties of FLS2 function, and by extension those of other RLKs, may have been 
overlooked or inappropriately interpreted through the use of RLK epitope tag 
fusions.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and model-based 
cost-utility and cost-benefit analysis of increased dosage (3 vs. 1 consecutive 
contests) and enhanced content (supplemental smoking-cessation counseling) of 
the Quit-and-Win contest using data from a randomized control trial enrolling 
college students in the US.
METHODS: For the cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses, we used a 
microsimulation model of the life course of current and former smokers to 
translate the distribution of the duration of continuous abstinence among each 
treatment arm's participants observed at the end of the trial (N = 1217) into 
expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs and an incremental net 
monetary benefit (INMB). Missing observations in the trial were classified as 
smoking. For our reference case, we took a societal perspective and used a 3% 
discount rate for costs and benefits. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) 
was performed to account for model and trial-estimated parameter uncertainty. We 
also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis (cost per additional intermediate 
cessation) using direct costs of the intervention and two trial-based estimates 
of intermediate cessation: (a) biochemically verified (BV) 6-month continuous 
abstinence and (b) BV 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months.
RESULTS: Multiple contests resulted in a significantly higher BV 6-month 
continuous abstinence rate (RD 0.04), at a cost of $1275 per additional quit, 
and increased the duration of continuous abstinence among quitters. In the long 
run, multiple contests lead to an average gain of 0.03 QALYs and were cost 
saving. Incorporating parameter uncertainty into the analyses, the expected INMB 
was greater than $1000 for any realistic willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming missing values were smoking, multiple contests appear to 
dominate a single contest from a societal perspective. Funding agencies seeking 
to promote population health by funding a Quit-and-Win contest in a university 
setting should strongly consider offering multiple consecutive contests. Further 
research is needed to evaluate multiple contests compared to no contest.

PURPOSE: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a prominent complication 
following cardiac catheterization, though the risk has progressively decreased 
in recent times with appropriate risk stratification and use of safer contrast 
agents. Despite data supporting further lowering of risk with the iso-osmolar 
agent, iodixanol, uptake has lagged, perhaps due to increased upfront cost of 
this agent. We undertook an economic analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of a strategy utilizing iodixanol compared to using a low-osmolar contrast 
agent.
METHODS: We created a Markov model to evaluate the two strategies, and included 
a differential relative risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, based on a 
systematic review of the literature. Downstream clinical events, including need 
for dialysis and mortality, were modeled using data from existing published 
literature. A third-party payer perspective was utilized for the analysis and 
presentation of the primary economic analysis.
RESULTS: The strategy of using iodixanol dominated in both the low-risk and 
high-risk base case analyses. However, the difference was quite small in the 
low-risk scenario (lifetime cost: C$678,034 vs. C$678,059 and life expectancy: 
19.80 vs. 19.72 years). The difference was more marked (life expectancy 15.65 
vs. 14.15 years and cost C$680,989 vs. C$682,023) in the high-risk case 
analysis. This was robust across most of the variables tested in sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: The use of iodixanol, compared with low-osmolar contrast agents, for 
cardiac catheterization, results in a small benefit clinical outcomes, and in a 
savings in direct healthcare costs. Overall, our analysis supports the use of 
iodixanol for cardiac catheterization, especially in patients at high risk of 
acute kidney injury.

BACKGROUND: Flight attendants may have an increased risk of some cancers from 
occupational exposure to cosmic radiation and circadian disruption.
METHODS: The incidence of thyroid, ovarian, and uterine cancer among ∼6000 
female flight attendants compared to the US population was evaluated via life 
table analyses. Associations of these cancers, melanoma, and cervical cancer 
with cumulative cosmic radiation dose and metrics of circadian disruption were 
evaluated using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Incidence of thyroid, ovarian, and uterine cancer was not elevated. No 
significant, positive exposure-response relations were observed. Weak, 
non-significant, positive relations were observed for thyroid cancer with cosmic 
radiation and time zones crossed and for melanoma with another metric of 
circadian disruption.
CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of increased risk of these cancers from 
occupational cosmic radiation or circadian disruption in female flight 
attendants. Limitations include few observed cases of some cancers, limited data 
on risk factors, and misclassification of exposures.

BACKGROUND: Dietary salt consumption is an important factor for mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Therefore, the aim of this study is to measure 
the levels of salt consumption and then estimate the effects of current levels 
of salt consumption on mortality from CVDs at national and subnational levels 
from 1990 to 2016 in Iran.
METHODS: In this study, we will use national and subnational studies with data 
on salt consumption, including self-report or lab tests for sodium measurement 
and all available published data about salt and sodium (with conduct a 
systematic review) to estimate salt exposure levels. We will also use data from 
death registration system (DRS) to estimate CVDs mortality attributable to salt 
consumption. We will use mixed-effects model to explore the effects of some 
covariates on salt consumption and then spatial-temporal model will be used to 
take into account how the values of salt consumption in each point vary further 
across time, space, and age. We will compute the proportional reduction in CVD 
deaths that will occur if salt consumption reduces to an alternative level (5 
g/d), using comparative risk assessment (CRA). The simulation analysis will be 
used to estimate the uncertainty of the number of deaths attributable to salt 
consumption. All analyses will be performed separately by sex and age groups, 
province and year in STATA and R software packages.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study seem to be helpful for providing good 
information about the salt consumption and CVDs mortality attributable to it for 
policymakers in directing future policy decisions and planning cost-effective 
strategies in Iran.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a functional exercise program 
supported by serious gaming for patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain 
(LBP).
METHODS: Ten patients with chronic nonspecific LBP and an underlying motor 
control impairment were recruited. Subjects performed a partially supervised 
exercise program (36 sessions, 18 weeks) that included 30 minutes of general 
conditioning and 90 minutes of individually tailored functional motor control 
exercises (MCEs). Serious games (SGs) were used to (1) improve thoracolumbar 
dissociation and (2) to provide postural feedback during functional MCEs. The 
SGs were also available at home.
RESULTS: Treatment satisfaction and the scores on the credibility/expectancy 
questionnaire were good and did not change throughout the intervention. Patients 
remained motivated throughout the rehabilitation program and no serious adverse 
events were reported. Overall, participants indicated that the SGs helped them 
to perform the home exercises more correctly, and as a consequence, they felt 
more confident doing them. However, the time needed to set up the games was a 
barrier for home use and participants would have found it useful to receive 
postural feedback during daily life activities.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to support a functional exercise program with SGs 
for patients with chronic nonspecific LBP, both in a supervised and a home 
environment. Time-efficiency and the integration of SGs in daily life activities 
are challenges that need to be addressed in the future.

BACKGROUND: Homeless people often suffer from complex and chronic comorbidities, 
have high rates of morbidity and die at much younger ages than the general 
population. Due to a complex combination of physical, psychosocial and addiction 
problems at the end of life, they often have limited access to palliative care. 
Both the homeless and healthcare providers experience a lot of barriers. 
Therefore, providing palliative care that fits the needs and concerns of the 
homeless is a challenge to healthcare providers. This systematic review aims to 
summarize evidence about the concerns, palliative care needs and preferences of 
homeless people, as well as barriers and facilitators for delivering high 
quality palliative care.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched up to 
10 May 2016. Included were studies about homeless people with a short life 
expectancy, their palliative care needs and the palliative care provided, that 
were conducted in Western countries. Data were independently extracted by two 
researchers using a predefined extraction form. Quality was assessed using a 
Critical Appraisal instrument. The systematic literature review was based on the 
PRISMA statement.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven publications from 23 different studies met the inclusion 
criteria; 15 studies were qualitative and eight were quantitative. Concerns of 
the homeless often related to end-of-life care not being a priority, drug 
dependence hindering adequate care, limited insight into their condition and 
little support from family and relatives. Barriers and facilitators often 
concerned the attitude of healthcare professionals towards homeless people. A 
respectful approach and respect for dignity proved to be important in good 
quality palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: A patient-centred, flexible and low-threshold approach embodying 
awareness of the concerns of homeless people is needed so that appropriate 
palliative care can be provided timely. Training, education and experience of 
professionals can help to accomplish this.

In this study, the fungicidal effects and detailed action of chitosan against 
Ceratocystis fimbriata were evaluated. The results demonstrated that chitosan 
exhibited strong antifungal activity that restricted the mycelium extension and 
changed the hyphal morphology. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide 
(PI) double-staining directly visualized decreased cell viability in response to 
chitosan treatment. Investigation of the PI influx showed that chitosan induced 
irreversible cell membrane damage. The efflux of potassium ions from the cytosol 
into the extracellular matrix demonstrated that chitosan induced the leakage of 
intracellular components. Massive intracellular bis-(1, 3-dibutylbarbituric 
acid) trimethine oxonol [DiBAC4(3)] accumulation indicated the dissipation of 
membrane potential. Furthermore, chitosan clearly decreased the activity of 
H+/K+ ATPase. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the fluorescence 
distribution and intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) changed as the 
incubation time increased. These results indicate that chitosan exerts a 
fungicidal effect via its ability to disturb fungal membranes.

BACKGROUND: Primary care health professionals, especially family physicians, see 
a variety of wounds, and yet-despite the frequency of providing wound care-many 
family physicians do not feel confident in wound care management. This is partly 
due to a lack of formal wound education in Family Medicine programs. While there 
are numerous electronic wound care resources available in the UK and North 
America, none were identified that address the specific need in supporting 
clinical decision-making in wound dressing selection. At the same time, 
healthcare providers are increasingly using technology in personal and 
professional contexts, and a logical extension is to use technology for 
knowledge translation strategies.
OBJECTIVE: This work developed a prototype mobile health software application 
named WounDS, designed to support clinical decision-making in selecting wound 
dressings. This article presents the development and evaluation plan for the 
WounDS app.
METHODS: WounDS has been developed on the iOS platform. The primary 
specification included ease of use, in that one of the primary influences in 
user adoption would be the ability to receive a wound dressing recommendation in 
under 30 seconds and under 5 taps on the screen. The WounDS app guides users 
through a series of binary decisions for assessing the wound and provides a 
wound dressing recommendation. The selection algorithm is based in best 
practices using the Wound Bed Preparation Paradigm.
RESULTS: Current work is underway to examine the implementation needs for WounDS 
to be most effectively utilized and to pilot test its feasibility and use in 
clinical care. Data will be collected through user trials, focus groups, and 
user metadata will be collected within the app. Optimizing these preconditions 
will enable a subsequent phase of study to determine effects on clinical 
decision-making and clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: WounDS is designed for knowledge translation, use of technology in 
clinical decision-making, and continuity of care. The benefits of WounDS include 
the potential to improve healthcare providers' competency in wound management 
and to improve wound healing through better alignment with evidence-based best 
practices in wound dressing selection, consistency in care from primary to 
community care, and subsequent downstream impacts in quality of life for 
patients.

PURPOSE: Health state utility values are derived from preference-based 
measurements and are useful in calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
which is a metric commonly used in cost-effectiveness studies. The purpose of 
this study was to convert the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score (ATRS) to the 
preference-based European Quality of Life-5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) by 
estimating the relationship between the two scores using mapping.
METHODS: Data were collected from a randomised controlled trial, where 100 
patients were treated either surgically or non-surgically for Achilles tendon 
rupture. Forty-three and forty-four patients in surgical group and non-surgical 
group completed the ATRS and the EQ-5D alongside each other during follow-up at 
three time points. Different models of the relationship between the ATRS and the 
EQ-5D were developed and analysed based on direct mapping and cross-validation. 
The model with the lowest mean absolute error was observed as the one with the 
best fit.
RESULTS: Among the competing models, mapping based on using a combination of the 
ATRS items four, five, and six associated with limitation due to pain, during 
activities of daily living and when walking on uneven ground, produced the best 
predictor of the EQ-5D score.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a mapping algorithm to enable the 
derivation of utility values directly from the ATRS. This approach makes it 
feasible for researchers, as well as medical practitioners, to obtain 
preference-based values in clinical studies or settings where only the ATRS is 
being administered. The algorithm allows for the calculation of QALYs for use in 
cost-effectiveness analyses, making it valuable in the study of acute Achilles 
tendon ruptures.

Due to medical advances and the availability of efficient immunosuppressive 
therapies, the life-expectancy of people suffering from inflammatory rheumatic 
diseases is continuously increasing. In Germany, geriatric patients (definition: 
age older than 70 years combined with geriatric multimorbidity) affected, e. g. 
by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) frequently receive corticosteroids and less often 
biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and conventional DMARDs 
(cDMARDs), which is justified by additionally existing comorbidities and 
polypharmacy. Using geriatric typical assessments as well as detailed medication 
regimens the treatment risk of bDMARD and cDMARD administration can be properly 
evaluated. Current data on biological therapy in older patients with rheumatism 
support this recommendation. Following the "choosing wisely" initiative of the 
German Association of Internal Medicine the authors listed 5 positive and 5 
negative recommendations concerning the pharmacotherapy of older patients 
suffering from rheumatism (e. g. RA) as practical guidance towards safer bDMARD 
and cDMARD treatment for geriatric RA patients.

The manufacturer of the calcimimetic drug etelcalcetide was invited to make an 
evidence submission as part of the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) Single Technology Appraisal (STA) programme. Within this 
submission, they reported evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of 
etelcalcetide for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis. The Southampton 
Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC), part of the Wessex Institute at 
the University of Southampton, was the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) 
commissioned to appraise the company's submission. This article describes the 
ERG's review and critique of the company's submission and summarises the NICE 
Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in June 2017). The 
clinical-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company consisted of two 
double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing etelcalcetide with 
placebo, one RCT comparing etelcalcetide with cinacalcet, two single-arm 
extension studies of the above trials, and one single-arm study evaluating the 
effect of switching from cinacalcet to etelcalcetide. No study specifically 
examined the population specified in the NICE appraisal scope: patients 
refractory to standard therapy with phosphate binders and vitamin D (PBVD). None 
of these trials were designed to collect long-term efficacy data for outcomes 
such as mortality, bone fractures, cardiovascular events, or 
parathyroidectomies. Instead, biomarker data from the trials were mapped to 
long-term outcomes by an assumed linear relationship between the trial outcome, 
reduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by > 30%, and the log-hazard ratios for 
the occurrence of clinical events derived from a large, long-term RCT of 
cinacalcet (the EVOLVE trial). After submission of a confidential Patient Access 
Scheme (PAS) discount reducing etelcalcetide drug costs, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet was £14,778 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the company's base case. While 
this value is lower than the NICE threshold range of £20,000 and £30,000 per 
QALY gained, it was the opinion of the ERG that the ICER was highly uncertain 
due to efficacy data limitations for etelcalcetide, inadequate synthesis of 
clinical-effectiveness evidence, and strong assumptions connecting short-term 
biomarker data with long-term clinical outcomes. The ERG produced an alternative 
base case for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet, with an ICER of £22,400 per QALY 
gained, also subject to uncertainty. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended 
etelcalcetide as an option for the treatment of SHPT in adults with CKD only if 
treatment with a calcimimetic is indicated and cinacalcet is not suitable, 
subject to the company's provision of the agreed PAS discount.

Hospital, Odense, and Department of Vascular Surgery, Viborg Hospital, Viborg, 
Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Population-based screening and intervention for abdominal aortic 
aneurysm, peripheral artery disease and hypertension was recently reported to 
reduce the relative risk of mortality among Danish men by 7 per cent. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of vascular screening 
versus usual care (ad hoc primary care-based risk assessment) from a national 
health service perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness evaluation was conducted alongside an RCT 
involving all men from a region in Denmark (50 156) who were allocated to 
screening (25 078) or no screening (25 078) and followed for up to 5 years. 
Mobile nurse teams provided screening locally and, for individuals with positive 
test results, referrals were made to general practices or hospital-based 
specialized centres for vascular surgery. Intention-to-treat-based, 
censoring-adjusted incremental costs (2014 euros), life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using Lin's average estimator 
method. Incremental net benefit was estimated using Willan's estimator and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The cost of screening was estimated at €148 (95 per cent c.i. 126 to 
169), and the effectiveness at 0·022 (95 per cent c.i. 0·006 to 0·038) 
life-years and 0·069 (0·054 to 0·083) QALYs, generating average costs of €6872 
per life-year and €2148 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €40 000 
per QALY, the probabilities of cost-effectiveness were 98 and 99 per cent 
respectively. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 71 per cent when all the 
sensitivity analyses were combined into one conservative scenario.
CONCLUSION: Vascular screening appears to be cost-effective and compares 
favourably with current screening programmes.

Moxibustion () is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy performed using 
Artemisia argyii. Zusanli (, ST36) is an acupoint in the stomach meridian, long 
associated in ancient Chinese medical practices with the extension of life span 
when moxibustion is applied to it. The aim of this study was to investigate 
changes in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels after application of 
moxibustion to ST36. Four healthy men and women participated in this 28-day 
trial and were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A received moxibustion 
treatment from days 1 to 14, while group B received moxibustion treatment from 
days 15 to 28. Blood samples were taken 5 times during this study to measure 
serum IGF-1 (s-IGF-1) levels. The s-IGF-1 levels increased in both groups after 
7 and 14 d of moxibustion therapy (group A: 11.02% [7 d] and 29.65% [14 d]; 
group B: 169.12% [7 d] and 274.85% [14 d]). After moxibustion therapy had been 
completed (day 14), s-IGF-1 levels continued to increase in group A (increases 
on day 21 and day 28 were 53.19% and 61.45%, respectively). There were no 
adverse events in either group. The s-IGF-1 levels were significantly raised in 
both groups after 7 and 14 d of moxibustion therapy. Moreover, once therapy had 
been completed, s-IGF-1 levels continued to increase in group A up to 14 d after 
the treatment.

BACKGROUND: Active Surveillance (AS) is a therapeutic strategy for early-stage 
Prostate Cancer (PCa) conceived to balance early detection of aggressive disease 
and overtreatment of indolent tumor. Several active surveillance protocols have 
been published over the years, however the risk of misclassification still 
exist. In this review, we revised the current criteria of AS and evaluated the 
characteristics of potential risk factors of misclassification or deferred 
treatment.
METHODS: We did a systematic search of the MEDLINE database, from 1993 to May 
2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analysis statement guidelines and limited to the English language. The 
search terms used included "prostate cancer" and "active surveillance" and 
"criteria. We have excluded from the study reviews and editorial comments as 
well as multiple papers from the same data sets.
RESULTS: Although the follow-up of reported studies was a quite short compared 
to the duration of the disease, the data are sufficient to conclude that active 
surveillance should be offered to men with low-risk disease and to men with 
intermediate risk and poor life expectancy. The present challenge, in fact, is 
to differentiate the clinically silent disease from the unfavorable course by 
identifying the right timing for any deferred treatment. This is made 
particularly difficult by the absence of randomized controlled trials directly 
comparing different AS monitoring methods.
CONCLUSION: As summarized in this review, it is still difficult to select 
patients eligible for active surveillance and differentiate them from those that 
should move to active treatment. From the data, currently available in the 
literature, however, it is possible to recommend active surveillance to men with 
low-risk disease and to men with intermediate-risk disease but with short life 
expectancy.

Background and aimsThe Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) study 
aimed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 31 selected 
diseases in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). Methods: 
DALYs were estimated using an incidence-based and pathogen-based approach. 
Incidence was estimated through assessment of data availability and quality, and 
a correction was applied for under-estimation. Calculation of DALYs was 
performed with the BCoDE software toolkit without applying time discounting and 
age-weighting. Results: We estimated that one in 14 inhabitants experienced an 
infectious disease episode for a total burden of 1.38 million DALYs (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI): 1.25-1.5) between 2009 and 2013; 76% of which was 
related to the acute phase of the infection and its short-term complications. 
Influenza had the highest burden (30% of the total burden), followed by 
tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/AIDS and invasive 
pneumococcal disease (IPD). Men had the highest burden measured in DALYs (60% of 
the total), adults 65 years of age and over had 24% and children less than 5 
years of age had 11%. Age group-specific burden showed that infants (less than 1 
year of age) and elderly people (80 years of age and over) experienced the 
highest burden. Conclusions: These results provide baseline estimates for 
evaluating infectious disease prevention and control strategies. The study 
promotes an evidence-based approach to describing population health and 
assessing surveillance data availability and quality, and provides information 
for the planning and prioritisation of limited resources in infectious disease 
prevention and control.

Value judgment of health interventions from different perspectives: arguments 
and criteria.

Center Groningen, P.O. Box 30.001, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: The healthcare sector is evolving while life expectancy is 
increasing. These trends put greater pressure on healthcare resources, prompt 
healthcare reforms, and demand transparent arguments and criteria to assess the 
overall value of health interventions. There is no consensus on the core 
criteria by which to value and prioritize interventions, and individual 
stakeholders might value specific elements differently. The present study is 
based on a literature review that retrieved the most widely recognized arguments 
and criteria used in decision-making. The aim was to compile a smaller set of 
arguments and criteria that would seem most relevant to different stakeholders.
METHODS: A literature review was performed in Medline and EMBASE. The initial 
search retrieved over 2000 articles and documents of relevant committees. A 
selection was made based on their reference to healthcare, policy issues, or 
social justice. Finally, 84 papers were included. Data extraction took place 
after appraisal of the articles. A full table was made, including all arguments 
and criteria found; next, identical or largely overlapping arguments were 
excluded. The remaining arguments and criteria were assessed for relevance and a 
reduced set was compiled.
RESULTS: The final set included 25 arguments and criteria, categorized by type 
(clinical, social justice, ethical, and policy). For each argument and 
criterion, relevance to stakeholders was scored on three levels (not, partly, 
and completely relevant).
CONCLUSIONS: Many arguments and criteria play a role in making value judgments 
on health interventions, but not all are relevant to all interventions. 
Moreover, they may interact with each other. A viable way to deal with 
interacting and possibly conflicting arguments and criteria might be to arrange 
public discussions that would evoke different stakeholders' perspectives.

Empirical Tryout of a New Statistic for Detecting Temporally Inconsistent 
Responders.

Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.

Statistical screening of self-report data is often advised to support the 
quality of analyzed responses - For example, reduction of insufficient effort 
responding (IER). One recently introduced index based on Mahalanobis's D for 
detecting outliers in cross-sectional designs replaces centered scores with 
difference scores between repeated-measure items: Termed person temporal 
consistency (D2ptc). Although the adapted D2ptc index demonstrated usefulness in 
simulation datasets, it has not been applied to empirical data. The current 
study addresses D2ptc's low uptake by critically appraising its performance 
across three empirical applications. Independent samples were selected to 
represent a range of scenarios commonly encountered by organizational 
researchers. First, in Sample 1, a repeat-measure of future time perspective 
(FTP) inexperienced working adults (age >40-years; n = 620) indicated that 
temporal inconsistency was significantly related to respondent age and item 
reverse-scoring. Second, in repeat-measure of team efficacy aggregations, D2ptc 
successfully detected team-level inconsistency across repeat-performance cycles. 
Thirdly, the usefulness of the D2ptc was examined in an experimental study 
dataset of subjective life expectancy indicated significantly more stable 
responding in experimental conditions compared to controls. The empirical 
findings support D2ptc's flexible and useful application to distinct study 
designs. Discussion centers on current limitations and further extensions that 
may be of value to psychologists screening self-report data for strengthening 
response quality and meaningfulness of inferences from repeated-measures 
self-reports. Taken together, the findings support the usefulness of the newly 
devised statistic for detecting IER and other extreme response patterns.

The tomato resistance gene Tm-22 encodes a coiled coil-nucleotide binding 
site-leucine rich repeat type resistance protein and confers effective immune 
response against tobamoviruses by detecting the presence of viral movement 
proteins (MPs). In this study, we show that the Nicotiana benthamiana Heat shock 
protein 90-kD (Hsp90) interacts with Tm-22. Silencing of Hsp90 reduced 
Tm-22-mediated resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the steady-state 
levels of Tm-22 protein. Further, Hsp90 associates with SGT1 in yeast and in 
plant cells. These results suggest that Hsp90-SGT1 complex takes part in 
Tm-22-mediated TMV resistance by functioning as chaperone to regulate Tm-22 
stability.

Three lifestyle-related issues of major significance for public health among the 
Inuit in contemporary Greenland: a review of adverse childhood conditions, 
obesity, and smoking in a period of social transition.

Greenland is a country in transition from a colonial past with subsistence 
hunting and fishing to an urban Nordic welfare state. Epidemiological transition 
from infectious to chronic diseases has been evident since the 1950s. Ninety 
percent of the population is Inuit. We studied three public health issues based 
on published literature, namely adverse childhood experiences, addictive 
behavior, and suicide; diet and obesity; and smoking. Alcohol consumption was 
high in the 1970s and 1980s with accompanying family and social disruption. This 
is still a cause of poor mental health and suicides in the generations most 
affected. The diet is changing from a traditional diet of fish and marine 
mammals to imported food including food items rich in sugar and fat from 
domestic animals, and the level of physical activity is decreasing with an 
ensuing epidemic rise in obesity. The prevalence of smoking is high at around 
60% among both men and women and is only slowly decreasing. Smoking shows large 
social variation, and tobacco-related diseases are widespread. The diseases and 
conditions outlined above all contribute towards a low life expectancy at 
birth-69 years for men and 74 years for women in 2011-2015-compared with 78 and 
84 years for men and women, respectively, on average in the European countries. 
The translation of government public health programs into local activities needs 
strengthening, and it must be realized that the improvement of public health is 
a long-term process.

Total arterial myocardial revascularization in patients over 70 years old - a 
new trend in coronary surgery in elderly.

Piątek J, Konstanty-Kalandyk J, Kędziora A, Hyochan Song B, Wierzbicki K, 
Darocha T, Milaniak I, Kapelak B.

INTRODUCTION: In modern society, civilization has extended the life expectancy 
of developed nations. The demographic analysis of Eurostat (European Statistical 
Office) predicts the increase of the population over 70 years old in Western 
Europe from 15.2% reported in 1995 to 19.5% in 2020. Undoubtedly, the incidence 
of cardiovascular diseases increases with age. Nowadays, they are the most 
commonly diagnosed disease, as well as the most common cause of death in 
patients over 70 years old. Therefore, a significant increase of surgeries in 
elderly patients, reaching up to 30%, is reported in cardiac surgery. As changes 
in operating technique are being observed, better outcomes of surgeries in 
elderly patients are being noted. With over 10 years of observation, more 
beneficial results are noted for arterial revascularization with usage of 
arterial grafts compared with venous ones. The aim of the study is to evaluate 
the safety of harvesting both internal mammary arteries and radial artery in 
CABG in patients over 70 years old and to analyze the incidence of major adverse 
cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and other postoperative complications 
in this cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective observational study we analyzed 101 
cases, where TAMR was applied in patients aged 70 yo or older between 2003 to 
2009 in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology, John Paul 
II Hospital, Kraków. Exclusion criteria included among others low left 
ventricular ejection fraction, high Euroscore, and accompanying valvular 
disease. Data was obtained from patient medical records. Baseline 
characteristics, intraoperative data and postoperative complications were 
assessed. All surgeries were performed in extracorporeal circulation and via 
median sternotomy.
RESULTS: In the study cohort, most patients suffered from multi-vessel disease 
(65.3%), and all required at least 2 bypass grafts. Left internal mammary artery 
(LIMA) was used in all cases, right internal mammary artery (RIMA) in 30.7%, and 
radial artery (RA) in 95% of surgeries. In 6.9% of individuals additional
