PREMISE OF STUDY: Accurate demographic information about long-lived plant 
species is important for understanding responses to large-scale disturbances, 
including climate change. It is challenging to obtain these data from desert 
perennial plants because seedling establishment is exceptionally rare, and 
estimates of survival are lacking for their vulnerable early stages. Desert 
wildfires, urbanization, and climate change influence the persistence of the 
long-lived Yucca brevifolia. Quantitative demographic attributes are crucial for 
understanding how populations will respond to disturbances and where populations 
will recede or advance under future climate scenarios.•
METHODS: We measured survival in a cohort of 53 pre-reproductive Y. brevifolia 
at Yucca Flat, Nevada, USA, for 22 yr and recorded their growth, nurse-plant 
relationships, and herbivory.•
KEY RESULTS: Herbivory by black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) caused 
severe losses of plants during the first and second years (45% and 31%, 
respectively). Surviving plants experienced <2.5% annual mortality. Survival for 
the population was 19% over 22 yr. Plants <25 cm in height had lower life 
expectancy. Average growth rate (± SD) for plants that survived to the last 
census was 3.12 ± 1.96 cm yr(-1), and growth rates were positively associated 
with precipitation. Thirty-year-old Y. brevifolia had not yet reproduced.•
CONCLUSIONS: A rare establishment event for Y. brevifolia during 1983-1984, 
triggered by above-average summer rainfall, provided a unique opportunity to 
track early survival and growth. Infrequent but acute episodes of herbivory 
during drought influenced demography for decades. Variability in survival among 
young Y. brevifolia indicates that size-dependent demographic variables will 
improve forecasts for this long-lived desert species under predicted regional 
climate change.

In the normal population, loss of one of the sex chromosomes leading to monosomy 
(45,X) is a part of the aging process. In Turner syndrome (TS), the classic 
karyotype 45,X is found in up to 50% at birth, and others have a second cell 
line; mosaicism. The aim was to study if the chromosomal pattern in TS women 
changes over time. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on buccal 
smear cells obtained twice, 10 years apart, from 42 women with TS aged 26-66 
years (mean±standard deviation: 42.0±11.6). DNA probes specific for chromosomes 
X (DXZ1) and Y (DYZ3) were used and >100 cells were analyzed/patient. Nineteen 
women had monosomy (45,X) (<10% 46,XX), nine had 45,X/46,XX mosaicism, and 14 
had iso, ring, or a marker chromosome at baseline. At 10 years, the percentage 
of diploid cells had increased in 29 of 42 women (69%), with an average increase 
of 5.7±13.0%. There was a positive correlation between age and % change in 
diploid 46,XX or 46,XY cells (r=0.38, p=0.023). This new finding might have 
relevance for the life expectancy in TS.

BACKGROUND: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is delivered continuously 
via intrajejunal percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term safety, efficacy and quality of life of LCIG in 
an open-label extension study.
METHODS: Patients received 52 weeks of open-label LCIG treatment following a 
12-week double-blind, double-dummy trial in which they were randomized to either 
LCIG or immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa. Patient cohort designation 
was by receipt of LCIG in the preceding trial randomization (continuing-LCIG vs. 
LCIG-naïve patients).
RESULTS: Sixty-two of 66 subjects in the double-blind proceeded to the 
open-label extension. Most subjects (95%) reported ≥1 adverse event (AE); only 3 
subjects (4.8%) discontinued due to AEs. AE incidence declined gradually over 52 
weeks. Serious AEs were reported by 23%. LCIG-naïve patients (N = 29) showed a 
decrease in "Off" time and an increase in "On" time without troublesome 
dyskinesia (change from baseline to final visit in mean [SD] hours = -2.34 
[2.78] P < 0.001 and 2.19 [3.70] P = 0.005, respectively), while continuing-LCIG 
patients (N = 33) showed sustained "Off" time duration and further improvement 
in "On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (-0.42 [2.67] P = 0.377 and 1.00 
[2.58] P = 0.036, respectively). The majority of patients in both groups 
(LCIG-naïve, continuing-LCIG, respectively) were rated 'Much Improved' or 'Very 
Much Improved' at final visit on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement 
scale (69.0%, 69.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Continuing-LCIG patients continued to derive benefit from LCIG 
while the magnitude of improvement among LCIG-naïve patients was similar to that 
observed for patients on LCIG in the preceding double-blind study. The overall 
AE profile was consistent with previous phase 3 clinical trials involving the 
LCIG system.

BACKGROUND: Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial 
infection in Scotland, and is associated with potentially serious reproductive 
outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal factor 
infertility (TFI) in women. Chlamydia testing in Scotland is currently targeted 
towards symptomatic individuals, individuals at high risk of existing undetected 
infection, and young people. The cost-effectiveness of testing and treatment to 
prevent PID and TFI in Scotland is uncertain.
METHODS: A compartmental deterministic dynamic model of chlamydia infection in 
15-24 year olds in Scotland was developed. The model was used to estimate the 
impact of a change in testing strategy from baseline (16.8% overall testing 
coverage; 0.4 partners notified and tested/treated per treated positive index) 
on PID and TFI cases. Cost-effectiveness calculations informed by best-available 
estimates of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to PID and TFI 
were also performed.
RESULTS: Increasing overall testing coverage by 50% from baseline to 25.2% is 
estimated to result in 21% fewer cases in young women each year (PID: 703 fewer; 
TFI: 88 fewer). A 50% decrease to 8.4% would result in 20% more PID (669 
additional) and TFI (84 additional) cases occurring annually. The cost per QALY 
gained of current testing activities compared to no testing is £40,034, which is 
above the £20,000-£30,000 cost-effectiveness threshold. However, calculations 
are hampered by lack of reliable data. Any increase in partner notification from 
baseline would be cost-effective (incremental cost per QALY gained for a partner 
notification efficacy of 1 compared to baseline: £5,119), and would increase the 
cost-effectiveness of current testing strategy compared to no testing, with 
threshold cost-effectiveness reached at a partner notification efficacy of 1.5. 
However, there is uncertainty in the extent to which partner notification is 
currently done, and hence the amount by which it could potentially be increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Current chlamydia testing strategy in Scotland is not 
cost-effective under the conservative model assumptions applied. However, with 
better data enabling some of these assumptions to be relaxed, current coverage 
could be cost-effective. Meanwhile, increasing partner notification efficacy on 
its own would be a cost-effective way of preventing PID and TFI from current 
strategy.

Behavioural medicine research provides evidence for the positive effects of 
cognitive behavioural approaches to psychosocial problems in patients with 
cancer and other chronic somatic illnesses. In an extension of this research 
line, Mewes et al. now provide evidence for the cost-effectiveness of cognitive 
behavioural therapy and physical exercise for alleviating treatment-induced 
menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients [J Cancer Surviv, Sep 2 2014]. 
These important findings are discussed and put into the context of future 
research and clinical practice regarding quality of life, quality-adjusted life 
years and patient reported outcomes. The benefits for the women concerned appear 
to be considerable.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very common clinical problem in elderly 
patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. As life 
expectancy continues to improve worldwide, there is a rising prevalence of 
comorbidities and risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes predisposing to 
a high burden of CKD in this population. The body of knowledge on the approach 
to elderly patient with CKD is still evolving. Thus, this review seeks to 
explore the epidemiology and to discuss current understanding of challenges in 
the diagnosis and management of elderly patients CKD.

445. Supporting a Movement for Health and Health Equity: Lessons from Social 
Movements: Workshop Summary.

Roundtable on Population Health Improvement; Roundtable on the Promotion of 
Health Equity and the Elimination of Health Disparities; Board on Population 
Health and Public Health Practice; Institute of Medicine.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2014 Dec 3.

Supporting a Movement for Health and Health Equity is the summary of a workshop 
convened in December 2013 by the Institute of Medicine Roundtable on the 
Promotion of Health Equity and the Elimination of Health Disparities and the 
Roundtable on Population Health Improvement to explore the lessons that may be 
gleaned from social movements, both those that are health-related and those that 
are not primarily focused on health. Participants and presenters focused on 
elements identified from the history and sociology of social change movements 
and how such elements can be applied to present-day efforts nationally and 
across communities to improve the chances for long, healthy lives for all. The 
idea of movements and movement building is inextricably linked with the history 
of public health. Historically, most movements—including, for example, those for 
safer working conditions, for clean water, and for safe food—have emerged from 
the sustained efforts of many different groups of individuals, which were often 
organized in order to protest and advocate for changes in the name of such 
values as fairness and human rights. The purpose of the workshop was to have a 
conversation about how to support the fragments of health movements that 
roundtable members believed they could see occurring in society and in the 
health field. Recent reports from the National Academies have highlighted 
evidence that the United States gets poor value on its extraordinary investments 
in health—in particular, on its investments in health care—as American life 
expectancy lags behind that of other wealthy nations. As a result, many 
individuals and organizations, including the Healthy People 2020 initiative, 
have called for better health and longer lives.

Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: Advances in Diagnosis, 
Management, and Controversies.

In this article, we aimed to review the literature on the clinics and management 
of nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NPNET). Pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) are rare tumors with a <1/100,000 incidence and 
constitute approximately 2 to 10% of all pancreatic tumors. Nonfunctional PNETs 
are difficult to detect at early stages since they have no symptoms. Except 
those detected accidentally during different diagnoses, the majority of PNETs 
are detected in the advanced stages, with symptoms related to tumor size or 
liver metastasis. We reviewed the studies published in the English medical 
literature through PubMed and summarized the clinical features and current 
approaches to the treatment and follow-up of the NPNET. The common imaging 
techniques used for the detection of tumor localization, size, locoregional, and 
metastatic involvement are contrasted computed tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. 
Surgical resection is the only curative treatment. However, in advanced 
locoregional disease and liver metastasis, interventive ablative therapies such 
as palliative reductive surgery, selective hepatic arterial embolization, 
radiofrequency ablation; and systemic therapies, such as peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy, chemotherapy, somatostatin analogous therapy, interferon, 
VEGF inhibitor, and mTOR inhibitor may be used as symptom relieving or may 
improve progression-free survival and total survival. Current knowledge on NPNET 
shows that the treatment should be personalized considering the prognostic 
features and life expectancy of the patient.

INTRODUCTION: Population-wide screening for epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements to 
inform cancer therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is recommended by 
guidelines. We estimated cost-effectiveness of multiplexed predictive biomarker 
screening in metastatic NSCLC from a societal perspective in the United States.
METHODS: We constructed a microsimulation model to compare the life expectancy 
and costs of multiplexed testing and molecularly guided therapy versus treatment 
with cisplatin-pemetrexed (CisPem). All testing interventions included a 
two-step algorithm of concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK overexpression testing 
with immunohistochemistry followed by ALK rearrangement confirmation with a 
fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for immunohistochemistry-positive 
results. Three strategies were included: "Test-treat" approach, where 
molecularly guided therapy was initiated after obtainment of test results; 
"Empiric switch therapy," with concurrent initiation of CisPem and testing and 
immediate switch to test-result conditional treatment after one cycle of CisPem; 
and "Empiric therapy" approach in which CisPem was continued for four cycles 
before start of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for "Test-treat" compared with 
treatment with CisPem was $136,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Both 
empiric treatment approaches had less favorable incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. "Test-treat" and "Empiric switch therapy" yielded higher expected 
outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years and life-years than "Empiric 
therapy." These results were robust across plausible ranges of model inputs.
CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, our cost-effectiveness results support 
the value of multiplexed genetic screening and molecularly guided therapy in 
metastatic NSCLC.

§University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.

BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is administered throughout the influenza 
disease season, even as late as March. Given such timing, what is the value of 
vaccinating the population earlier than currently being practiced?
METHODS: We used real data on when individuals were vaccinated in Allegheny 
County, Pennsylvania, and the following 2 models to determine the value of 
vaccinating individuals earlier (by the end of September, October, and 
November): Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED), an 
agent-based model (ABM), and FluEcon, our influenza economic model that 
translates cases from the ABM to outcomes and costs [health care and lost 
productivity costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. We varied the 
reproductive number (R0) from 1.2 to 1.6.
RESULTS: Applying the current timing of vaccinations averted 223,761 influenza 
cases, $16.3 million in direct health care costs, $50.0 million in productivity 
losses, and 804 in QALYs, compared with no vaccination (February peak, R0 1.2). 
When the population does not have preexisting immunity and the influenza season 
peaks in February (R0 1.2-1.6), moving individuals who currently received the 
vaccine after September to the end of September could avert an additional 
9634-17,794 influenza cases, $0.6-$1.4 million in direct costs, $2.1-$4.0 
million in productivity losses, and 35-64 QALYs. Moving the vaccination of just 
children to September (R0 1.2-1.6) averted 11,366-1660 influenza cases, 
$0.6-$0.03 million in direct costs, $2.3-$0.2 million in productivity losses, 
and 42-8 QALYs. Moving the season peak to December increased these benefits, 
whereas increasing preexisting immunity reduced these benefits.
CONCLUSION: Even though many people are vaccinated well after September/October, 
they likely are still vaccinated early enough to provide substantial 
cost-savings.

The effect of polydioxanone absorbable plates in septorhinoplasty for 
stabilizing caudal septal extension grafts.

Hospital and Health Science System2Division of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of 
Illinois at Chicago.

IMPORTANCE: Caudal septal extension grafts (CSEGs) can be used to alter and 
secure nasal projection and length. Graft position and thickness play an 
important role in terms of both function and aesthetics. The limitations of 
harvesting cartilage from additional sites necessitate development of a more 
efficient method for securing CSEGs.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of polydioxanone absorbable plates 
used in primary and revision septorhinoplasty.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We investigated all patients who underwent 
primary or revision septorhinoplasty with the use of absorbable plates to secure 
CSEGs at a tertiary academic medical center from 2010 to 2014. To standardize 
and objectify the symptoms of nasal obstruction, a validated quality-of-life 
instrument called the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) questionnaire, 
with 5 questions on a scale of 0 to 4, was implemented preoperatively and 
postoperatively. Preoperative and multiple successive postoperative measurements 
of nasal length and projection were taken using 3dMDvultus imaging software.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in NOSE questionnaire score, change in nasal 
length and projection, and complications.
RESULTS: There were no absorbable plate-related complications in the 95 included 
patients. Comparing preoperative and postoperative NOSE questionnaire scores, 
there was a statistically significant improvement in all 5 categories: mean (SD) 
change of -1.42 (1.59) in congestion, -1.56 (1.53) in blockage or obstruction, 
-1.60 (1.54) in breathing through nose, -0.90 (1.54) in trouble sleeping, and 
-1.28 (1.46) in breathing during exercise (P < .001 for all) in the 50 patients 
with available data. In the 24 patients with greater than 180 days of follow-up, 
follow-up ranged from 183 to 717 days, and mean (SD) change in nasal length and 
projection was 0.64 (2.19) and 0.26 (0.96) mm, respectively, showing no 
statistically significant change over time (P = .17 and .21, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In our study population, nasal length and projection 
maintained position over time when absorbable plates were used to secure CSEGs. 
Absorbable plates appear safe and effective when used to secure CSEGs and limit 
the requirement of harvesting additional cartilage. Nasal airway improvement can 
be obtained when absorbable plates are used to secure CSEGs.

Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly.

Author information:
(1)Department of Clinical and Administrative Sciences, California Northstate 
University College of Pharmacy, Elk Grove, California, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to review the evidence evaluating the efficacy of 
statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease in the 
elderly.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-January 2013) 
using the terms HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, statin, primary prevention, 
elderly, and geriatrics was performed. The search was limited to clinical 
trials, meta-analyses, and subanalyses, including primary prevention patients. 
Bibliographies of selected articles were examined to identify additional 
clinical trials.
STUDY SELECTION: Fourteen clinical trials, subanalyses, and meta-analyses were 
reviewed. A total of seven clinical trials and subanalyses evaluating statin 
therapy versus placebo in the elderly primary prevention patients with a primary 
endpoint of hard coronary heart disease were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data collected from the clinical trials and subanalyses 
included number of elderly patients randomized, therapy, duration of follow-up, 
and the incidence of coronary events.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The average annual rates of first CV event increases as patients 
age. There is strong evidence that supports the use of statins for secondary 
prevention; although primary prevention, specifically in the elderly, is less 
defined. This paper reviews the literature specifically for primary prevention, 
for which the results have shown a trend toward decreased first occurrence of 
coronary heart disease with statin therapy in elderly patients.
CONCLUSION: Statin therapy should be considered as a primary prevention therapy 
against coronary disease for elderly patients. Evidence-based clinical benefits 
are seen in this patient population. However, clinical judgment and 
consideration of comorbidities that may impact life expectancy should be 
assessed to determine appropriateness for individual patients.

A new approach for quantifying the net environmental impact of a "community" of 
interrelated products is demonstrated for consumer electronics owned by an 
average U.S. household over a 15-year period (1992-2007). This 
consumption-weighted life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology accounts for both 
product consumption (number of products per household) and impact (cumulative 
energy demand (MJ) and greenhouse gas emissions (MT CO2 eq) per product), 
analyzed using a hybrid LCA framework. Despite efficiency improvements in 
individual devices from 1992 to 2007, the net impact of the entire product 
community increased, due primarily to increasing ownership and usage. The net 
energy impact for the product community is significant, nearly 30% of the 
average gasoline use in a U.S. passenger vehicle in 2007. The analysis points to 
a large contribution by legacy products (cathode ray tube televisions and 
desktop computers), due to historically high consumption rates, although impacts 
are beginning to shift to smaller mobile devices. This method is also applied to 
evaluate prospective intervention strategies, indicating that environmental 
impact can be reduced by strategies such as lifespan extension or energy 
efficiency, but only when applied to all products owned, or by transforming 
consumption trends toward fewer, highly multifunctional products.

Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality, occurring in one in 
691 live births in the United States each year. Prenatally, the sequential 
contingent test for aneuploidy screening is highly sensitive for Down syndrome 
and has a low false-positive rate. The diagnosis should be confirmed with 
fluorescent in situ hybridization followed by chromosomal karyotyping at birth. 
Children with Down syndrome have varied degrees of intellectual disability and 
more health complications than other children. However, advancements in recent 
decades have led to improved life expectancy, satisfaction, and quality of life. 
Newborns with Down syndrome require echocardiography and cardiology evaluation. 
Children should have annual screenings for vision and hearing, and laboratory 
studies for subclinical thyroid disease and blood disorders. Clinicians should 
provide unbiased and comprehensive culturally sensitive information regarding 
available services for children with Down syndrome. There is good evidence that 
comprehensive early intervention programs (e.g., speech, visual, physical, and 
occupational therapy; child psychology) enhance development. It is important to 
enroll children with Down syndrome in state-specific resources as early as 
possible. Given the advances in medical care and early intervention programs, 
regular health supervision by family physicians can allow children with Down 
syndrome to lead healthy and productive lives.

[Cardiac and metabolic risk factors in severe mental disorders. Task of a 
prevention manager].

People with severe mental disorders have a reduction in life expectancy of 
13-30 % compared with the general population. This severe disadvantage is 
primarily due to an increased prevalence of cardiac and metabolic disorders, 
especially coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus and are the 
result of untoward health behavior characterized by smoking, low levels of 
physical activity and unhealthy dietary habits. Obesity, arterial hypertension 
and lipid disorders are also associated with this behavior and further increase 
the risk of CHD and type 2 diabetes. Thus, people with mental disorders 
constitute a population with a high risk of cardiovascular events. Appropriate 
measures for prevention and therapy are urgently indicated but rarely applied. 
This article presents new organizational structures to overcome this deficit 
with a prevention manager playing a central role in organizing and applying 
preventive and therapeutic care. Results from cardiology and diabetic medicine 
have shown the effectiveness of pooling this responsibility. The measure has the 
potential to reduce the increased mortality of people with severe mental 
disorders.

Nicotine and chlorpyrifos are developmental neurotoxicants that target serotonin 
systems. We examined whether prenatal nicotine exposure alters the subsequent 
response to chlorpyrifos given postnatally. Pregnant rats received nicotine 
throughout gestation at 3mg/kg/day, a regimen designed to achieve plasma levels 
seen in smokers; chlorpyrifos was given to pups on postnatal days (PN) 1-4 at 
1mg/kg, just above the detection threshold for brain cholinesterase inhibition. 
We assessed long-term effects from adolescence (PN30) through full adulthood 
(PN150), measuring the expression of serotonin receptors and serotonin turnover 
(index of presynaptic impulse activity) in cerebrocortical brain regions 
encompassing the projections that are known targets for nicotine and 
chlorpyrifos. Nicotine or chlorpyrifos individually increased the expression of 
serotonin receptors, with greater effects on males than on females and with 
distinct temporal and regional patterns indicative of adaptive synaptic changes 
rather than simply an extension of initial injury. This interpretation was 
confirmed by our finding an increase in serotonin turnover, connoting 
presynaptic serotonergic hyperactivity. Animals receiving the combined treatment 
showed a reduction in these adaptive effects on receptor binding and turnover 
relative to the individual agents, or even an effect in the opposite direction; 
further, normal sex differences in serotonin receptor concentrations were 
dissipated or reversed, an effect that was confirmed by behavioral evaluations 
in the Novel Objection Recognition Test. In addition to the known liabilities 
associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, our results point to 
additional costs in the form of heightened vulnerability to neurotoxic chemicals 
encountered later in life.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have tended to 
experience a longer life expectancy and higher quality of life. In this context, 
the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the demographic, 
clinical, and laboratory markers of patients with CF during the last two decades 
at a CF referral center.
METHODS: A retrospective study of the demographic, clinical, and laboratory 
markers for CF treatment at a CF referral center was performed during two 
decades: 2000 (DI, 1990-2000, n = 104 patients) and 2010 (DII, 2000-2010, 
n = 181 patients).
RESULTS: The following variables were less common in DI than in DII: (i) 
pancreatic insufficiency, (ii) meconium ileus, (iii) diabetes mellitus, (iv) 
Burkholderia cepacia colonization, (v) moderate and severe Shwachman-Kulczycki 
score (SKS), (vi) F508del mutation screening, (vii) patients without an 
identified CFTR mutation (class IV, V, or VI mutation), (viii) patients above 
the 10th percentile for weight and height, (ix) restrictive lung disease, and 
(x) older patients (p < 0.01). The following variables were more common in DI 
than in DII: (i) excellent and good SKS, (ii) F508del heterozygous status, (iii) 
colonization by mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (iv) obstructive 
lung disease, and (v) minimal time for CF diagnosis (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes differed between the two decades. Demographic, 
clinical, and laboratory markers in patients with CF are useful tools and should 
be encouraged in CF referral centers to determine the results of CF management 
and treatment, enabling a better understanding of this disease and its clinical 
evolution. Early diagnosis and management of CF will improve patients' quality 
of life and life expectancy until personalized drug therapy is possible for all 
patients with CF.

OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in the management of patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) increased the rates of disease remission and patient life 
expectancy, while malignancy has become a more common cause of death. Here, we 
report the incidence of malignancy in a nationwide survey of Japanese patients 
with RA compared to the general population, focusing on the risk of lymphoma, 
which often arises in patients with RA.
METHODS: Data on the occurrence of malignancy were collected from patients 
registered in a nationwide Japanese cohort database, the National Database of 
Rheumatic Diseases by iR-net in Japan, from 2003 to 2012. To adjust for 
different population composition and to compare the incidence of malignancy with 
the general population, standardized incidence rates (SIR) were calculated. To 
identify risk factors for lymphoma, individual patient data were obtained for 
multivariate analysis for the year before lymphoma diagnosis.
RESULTS: In 10 years, the cohort composed of 66,953 patient-years yielded 559 
malignancies, most frequently lung cancer, followed by gastric cancer, breast 
cancer, and lymphoma. The overall incidence of malignancies in patients with RA 
was slightly lower than in the general population (SIR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97). 
However, lymphoma risk was significantly higher (SIR 3.43, 95% CI 2.59-4.28), 
whereas risk of colon, rectal, or liver cancer was lower. Significant risk 
factors for lymphoma were the use of methotrexate or tacrolimus, and higher age.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA had no higher overall incidence of malignancies, 
but lymphoma was significantly more frequent than in the general population.

INTRODUCTION: In the last decades, life expectancy of persons with Down syndrome 
(DS) has dramatically increased and it is estimated that they will be living as 
long as the general population within a generation. Despite being included among 
the progeroid syndromes, because of the presence of features typically observed 
in older adults, DS is still regarded as a disease of pediatric interest. 
Because limited knowledge is available on the clinical characteristics of adults 
with DS, this study aimed to assess clinical and non-clinical features of this 
population and to describe similarities to the geriatric population.
METHODS: In this study, we described 60 adults with DS evaluated at the Day 
Hospital of the Geriatric Department of the Policlinico A. Gemelli, Università 
Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome. Individuals were assessed through a 
standardized protocol.
RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 38 years (range, 18-58 years) 
and 42 (70.0%) were women. Geriatric conditions were highly prevalent: severe 
cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 39 (65.0%) participants, behavioral 
symptoms were present in 25 (41.7%), and functional impairment in 23 (38.3%). 
Six (10.0%) participants lived in institutions and 11 (18.3%) were diagnosed as 
obese. The mean number of drugs used was 2.4; use of psychotropic drugs was 
highly prevalent. The most common chronic diseases were thyroid problems (44, 
73.3%), followed by mood disorders (19, 31.7%), osteoporosis (18, 30.0%), and 
cardiac problems (10, 16.7%). Geriatric conditions and chronic diseases were 
more prevalent among participants aged ≥40 years.
CONCLUSION: Several similarities between older adults and adults with DS were 
observed. Comorbidities, geriatric conditions, cognitive and functional 
deficits, and social problems are highly prevalent in both populations, 
contributing to the high complexity of these patients' assessment and treatment.

A complex decision path with a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio is 
mandatory for drug treatment in advanced age. Enrollment biases in randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) cause an under-representation of older individuals. In 
high-risk frail older subjects, the lack of RCTs makes clinical decision-making 
particularly difficult. Frail individuals are markedly susceptible to adverse 
drug reactions, and frailty may result in reduced treatment efficacy. Life 
expectancy should be included in clinical decision-making paths to better assess 
the benefits and risks of different drug treatments in advanced age. We 
performed a scoping review of principal hospital- and community-based prognostic 
indices in older age. Mortality prognostic tools could help clinical 
decision-making in diagnostics and therapeutics, tailoring appropriate 
intervention for older patients. The effectiveness of drug treatments may be 
significantly different in older patients with different risk of mortality. 
Clinicians need to consider the prognostic information obtained through 
well-validated, accurate, and calibrated predictive tools to identify those 
patients who may benefit from drug treatments given with the aim of increasing 
survival.

Protein dynamics in the solid state from 2H NMR line shape analysis: a 
consistent perspective.

Deuterium line shape analysis of CD3 groups has emerged as a particularly useful 
tool for studying microsecond-millisecond protein motions in the solid state. 
The models devised so far consist of several independently conceived simple 
jump-type motions. They are comprised of physical quantities encoded in their 
simplest form; improvements are only possible by adding yet another simple 
motion, thereby changing the model. The various treatments developed are 
case-specific; hence comparison among the different systems is not possible. 
Here we develop a new methodology for (2)H NMR line shape analysis free of these 
limitations. It is based on the microscopic-order-macroscopic-disorder (MOMD) 
approach. In MOMD motions are described by diffusion tensors, spatial 
restrictions by potentials/ordering tensors, and geometric features by relative 
tensor orientations. Jump-type motions are recovered in the limit of large 
orientational potentials. Model improvement is accomplished by monitoring the 
magnitude, symmetry, and orientation of the various tensors. The generality of 
MOMD makes possible comparison among different scenarios. CD3 line shapes from 
the Chicken Villin Headpiece Subdomain and the Streptomyces Subtilisin Inhibitor 
are used as experimental examples. All of these spectra are reproduced by using 
rhombic local potentials constrained for simplicity to be given by the L = 2 
spherical harmonics, and by axial diffusion tensors. Potential strength and 
rhombicity are found to be ca. 2-3 k(B)T. The diffusion tensor is tilted at 120° 
from the C-CD3 axis. The perpendicular (parallel) correlation times for local 
motion are 0.1-1.0 ms (3.3-30 μs). Activation energies in the 1.1-8.0 kcal/mol 
range are estimated. Future prospects include extension to the (2)H relaxation 
limit, application to the (15)N and (13)C NMR nuclei, and accounting for 
collective motions and anisotropic media.

The influence of spatial resolution on human health risk co-benefit estimates 
for global climate policy assessments.

Assessment of the ability of climate policies to produce desired improvements in 
public health through co-benefits of air pollution reduction can consume 
resources in both time and research funds. These resources increase 
significantly as the spatial resolution of models increases. In addition, the 
level of spatial detail available in macroeconomic models at the heart of 
climate policy assessments is much lower than that available in traditional 
human health risk modeling. It is therefore important to determine whether 
increasing spatial resolution considerably affects risk-based decisions; which 
kinds of decisions might be affected; and under what conditions they will be 
affected. Human health risk co-benefits from carbon emissions reductions that 
bring about concurrent reductions in Particulate Matter (PM10) emissions is 
therefore examined here at four levels of spatial resolution (Uniform Nation, 
Uniform Region, Uniform County/city, Health Risk Assessment) in a case study of 
Taiwan as one of the geographic regions of a global macroeceonomic model, with 
results that are representative of small, industrialized nations within that 
global model. A metric of human health risk mortality (YOLL, years of life lost 
in life expectancy) is compared under assessments ranging from a "uniform 
simulation" in which there is no spatial resolution of changes in ambient air 
concentration under a policy to a "highly spatially resolved simulation" (called 
here Health Risk Assessment). PM10 is chosen in this study as the indicator of 
air pollution for which risks are assessed due to its significance as a 
co-benefit of carbon emissions reductions within climate mitigation policy. For 
the policy examined, the four estimates of mortality in the entirety of Taiwan 
are 747 YOLL, 834 YOLL, 984 YOLL and 916 YOLL, under Uniform Taiwan, Uniform 
Region, Uniform County and Health Risk Assessment respectively; or differences 
of 18%, 9%, 7% if the HRA methodology is taken as the baseline. While these 
differences are small compared to uncertainties in health risk assessment more 
generally, the ranks of different regions and of emissions categories as the 
focus of regulatory efforts estimated at these four levels of spatial resolution 
are quite different. The results suggest that issues of risk equity within a 
nation might be missed by the lower levels of spatial resolution, suggesting 
that low resolution models are suited to calculating national cost-benefit 
ratios but not as suited to assessing co-benefits of climate policies reflecting 
intersubject variability in risk, or in identifying sub-national regions and 
emissions sectors on which to focus attention (although even here, the errors 
introduced by low spatial resolution are generally less than 40%).
