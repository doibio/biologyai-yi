The direct incorporation of essential oils (EOs) into real food system faces 
numerous challenges due to high volatility, intense aroma, and instability. This 
research aimed to enhance the stability and bio-efficacy of Pimenta dioica 
essential oil (PDEO) through encapsulation in chitosan (CN) nanoemulsion. The 
nanoemulsion (CN-PDEO) was fabricated through ionic-gelation technique. CN-PDEO 
exhibited high nanoencapsulation efficiency (85.84%) and loading capacity 
(8.26%) with the particle size ranging between 18.53 and 70.56 nm. Bio-efficacy 
assessment results showed that CN-PDEO presented more effective antifungal and 
antiaflatoxigenic activity against Aspergillus flavus (AF-LHP-VS8) at lower 
doses (1.6 and 1.0 µL/mL) than the pure PDEO (2.5 and 1.5 µL/mL, respectively, 
p < 0.05). Additionally, CN-PDEO preserved model food (maize) from aflatoxin 
B1and lipid peroxidation without altering their sensory properties during 
storage with high safety profile (p < 0.05). Overall results concluded that 
CN-PDEO can be recommended for shelf-life extension of stored maize and other 
food commodities.

BACKGROUND: Primary brain tumors are among the main causes of death. This study 
aimed to determine the epidemiological features of the brain and central nervous 
system cancer in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
METHODS: In this study, data of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study were 
used to estimate the incidence, prevalence, deaths, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), and mortality in 21 countries in the MENA region from 1990 to 
2019 based on age and sex. The percentage of the changes of epidemiologic 
indicators was calculated between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: Palestine and Turkey had the highest rate of brain and central nervous 
system cancer in 2019. Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iraq, and Lebanon had the highest 
percentage of incidence rate changes from 1990 to 2019. The prevalence of brain 
and central nervous system cancer in the MENA region was increased from 7.51 
(95% CI: 4.95-11.01) in 1990 to 16.45 (95% CI: 10.83-19.54) in 2019 (percentage 
of changes = 54.35%). The standardized age mortality rate in the MENA region was 
increased by 2.7% in 2019 compared to that in 1990. The rate of standardized age 
of DALY per 100,000 individuals in the MENA region decreased from 135.09 (95% 
CI: 92.57-199.92) in 1990 to 128.34 (95% CI: 87.81-151.3) in 2019.
CONCLUSION: The incidence rate, prevalence, and standardized age mortality (per 
100,000) had increased significantly in the MENA region in 2019 compared to 
those in 1990. Focusing on the diversity of the estimates of such indices in 
different countries of MENA can lead to the identification of important risk 
factors for brain cancer in future studies.

The study aims to examine the current status and differences in the burden of 
disease in Korea during 2008-2018. We calculated the burden of disease for 
Koreans from 2008 to 2018 using an incidence-based approach. Disability adjusted 
life years (DALYs) were expressed in units per 100 000 population by adding 
years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALY 
calculation results were presented by gender, age group, disease, region, and 
income level. To explore differences in DALYs by region and income level, we 
used administrative district and insurance premium information from the National 
Health Insurance Service claims data. The burden of disease among Koreans showed 
an increasing trend from 2008 to 2018. By 2017, the burden of disease among men 
was higher than that among women. Diabetes mellitus, low back pain, and chronic 
lower respiratory disease were ranked high in the burden of disease; the sum of 
DALY rates for these diseases accounted for 18.4% of the total burden of disease 
among Koreans in 2018. The top leading causes associated with a high burden of 
disease differed slightly according to gender, age group, and income level. In 
this study, we measured the health status of Koreans and differences in the 
population health level according to gender, age group, region, and income 
level. This data can be used as an indicator of health equity, and the results 
derived from this study can be used to guide community-centered (or customized) 
health promotion policies and projects, and for setting national health policy 
goals.

Improving enzyme stability is very important for enzyme applications. Structural 
modification is a reliable and effective method to improve the characteristics 
of protein. By artificially extending the C-terminus, 6 domain modification 
variants of different sizes were constructed, and a new enzyme species with high 
stability was obtained. Experimental results affirmed that high stability can be 
achieved by decreasing the degree of domain freedom. The optimum temperatures of 
domain modification variants were improved by 10 °C compared with the original 
enzyme. Specifically, compared with the original enzyme, the half-life of the 
variant dexYG-fdx (D-F) was increased to 280% under 35 °C and 200% under 45 °C, 
and the pH tolerance range was wider. Further structural simulations and 
molecular docking studies provided a reasonable explanation (The increased 
domain reduced the degree of freedom of the enzyme terminal to some extent) for 
this variant to increase stability and produce dextran. This study can provide 
valuable information for increasing the characteristics of recombinant 
dextransucrase.

INTRODUCTION: With continued technical advances in surgical instruments and 
growing surgical expertise, many laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomies (LPDs) 
have been safely performed with favorable outcomes, and this approach is being 
used more frequently. With an increase in the life expectancy, interest in 
treatments for elderly patients has increased. In this study, we investigated 
the safety and feasibility of LPD in octogenarians.
METHODS: From September 2005 to February 2020, resectable/borderline resectable 
periampullary tumors (PATs) were diagnosed in 71 octogenarians at Sincheon 
Severance Hospital and CHA Bundang Medical Center. Patients were divided into 
two groups: those who underwent surgery (PD, N = 38) and those who did not (NPD, 
N = 33). The group that underwent surgery was further divided into two groups: 
those who underwent open PD (OPD, N = 19), and those who underwent LPD (LPD, 
N = 19). Perioperative outcomes, including long-term survival, were 
retrospectively compared between these groups.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, 
diagnosis, and chemo-radiotherapy between the surgery and non-surgery groups. 
The PD group had a better survival rate than the NPD group (p < 0.05). The 
baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes were not significantly 
different between the OPD and LPD groups. Only three and two patients in the OPD 
and LPD groups had a biochemical leak (p > 0.999). There was no significant 
difference in overall survival and disease-free survival between the OPD and LPD 
groups (p = 0.816, p = 0.446, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: LPD is a good alternative for octogenarians with PAT requiring PD.

Animals perform a series of actions in a fixed order during ritualistic innate 
behaviors. Although command neurons and sensory pathways responding to external 
stimuli that trigger these behaviors have been identified, how each action is 
induced in a fixed order in response to multimodal sensory stimuli remains 
unclear. Here, the sexually dimorphic lateral antennal lobe tract projection 
neuron 4 (lPN4) in male Drosophila melanogaster mediates the expression of a 
fixed behavioral action pattern at the beginning of the courtship ritual, in 
which a male taps a female body and then extends a wing unilaterally to produce 
a courtship song. We found that blocking the synaptic output of lPN4 caused an 
increase in the ratio of male flies that extended a wing unilaterally without 
tapping the female body, whereas excitation of lPN4 suppressed the transition 
from the tapping phase to the unilateral wing extension phase. Real-time calcium 
imaging showed that lPN4 is activated by a volatile pheromone, palmitoleic acid, 
whose responses were inhibited by simultaneous gustatory stimulation with female 
cuticular hydrocarbons, showing the existence of an "AND-gate" for multimodal 
sensory inputs during male courtship behaviors. These results suggest that the 
function of lPN4 is to suppress unilateral wing extension while responding to a 
female smell, which is released by appropriate contact chemosensory inputs 
received when tapping a female. As the female smell also promotes male courtship 
behaviors, the olfactory system is ready to simultaneously promote and suppress 
the progress of courtship actions while responding to a female 
smell.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although it has been 80 years since Konrad Lorenz 
and Niko Tinbergen introduced how multiple acts comprising separate innate 
behaviors are released in a fixed order according to external stimuli, the 
neural circuits responsible for such fixed action patterns remain largely 
unknown. The male courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster is a good model 
to investigate how such a fixed behavioral sequence is determined in the brain. 
Here, we show that lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in D. 
melanogaster functions as an "AND-gate" for volatile and contact chemosensory 
inputs, mediating the expression of tapping behaviors before unilateral wing 
extension during male courtship rituals.

Associations of serum calcium (S-Ca) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D) 
concentrations with longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are not clear. 
We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to examine the associations of S-Ca 
and S-25(OH)D with longevity and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. The 
primary genetic instruments for S-Ca and S-25(OH)D were obtained from 
genome-wide association meta-analyses that included 61,054 individuals for S-Ca 
and up to 79,366 individuals for S-25(OH)D. Genetic variants associated with 
S-Ca and S-25(OH)D in the UK Biobank were used as confirmatory instruments. We 
obtained summary-level data for associations of these instruments with 
individual survival later than the 90th versus at most the 60th percentile of 
expected age at death from a genome-wide association meta-analysis including 
11,262 cases and 25,483 controls, and with parental longevity (both parents in 
top 10% percentile) from the UK Biobank including 7,182 cases and 79,767 
controls. Data for cardiovascular disease (111,108 cases and 107,684 controls) 
and cancer (38,036 cases and 180,756 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen 
consortium. A one standard deviation increase in genetically-predicted S-Ca 
concentration was associated with lower odds of longevity (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% 
CI, 0.55-0.95) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 1.11; 
95% CI, 1.03-1.20). The associations were consistent in confirmatory analyses. 
There was no evidence supporting an association between genetically-predicted 
S-Ca and cancer, and no associations of genetically-predicted S-25(OH)D with the 
studied outcomes. Lifelong higher levels of S-Ca but not S-25(OH)D may shorten 
life expectancy and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Surgical treatment is preferred therapy of early-stage cervical carcinoma. In 
the risk of cancer recurrence surgery is often followed by adjuvant 
radiotherapy. In our retrospective study we aimed at identifying late 
(≥6 months) and very late (≥5 years) radiation adverse effects on imaging scans 
as CT, PET/CT and MRI in patients who underwent successful treatment for 
cervical carcinoma by radical surgery combined with radiotherapy ± chemotherapy. 
We correlated imaging results with clinical manifestations. We selected young 
and middle-aged patients with long life expectancy, as late radiation-related 
toxicities may significantly affect their quality of life. Patients were 
selected from those who were primary diagnosed and treated between the years 
1987-2011 and regularly visited our Oncology department in years 2011-2012. 
Following inclusion criteria were applied: age ≤55 years at diagnosis, clinical 
follow-up ≥5 years and at least one tomography scan ≥3 years after finished 
treatment. One hundred and three subjects were reviewed: 73 patients met all 
inclusion criteria, while 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria except 
for available tomography scan ≥3 years after therapy. The mean imaging follow-up 
was 11.2 ± 7.6 years and the mean clinical follow-up was 15.0 ± 6.9 years. In 20 
(27%) subjects 27 cases grade I radiation-related toxicities were found; 9 (33%) 
of those 27 cases were clinically silent. In 14 (19%) females only grade I 
toxicities were observed. Grade III-IV toxicities were found in 5 (6.8%) 
subjects. No grade V toxicities were observed. We concluded that severe late 
side effects caused by radiotherapy were exceedingly rare in females 
successfully treated for early-stage cervical carcinoma, only 1 bilateral 
osteonecrosis, 2 cases of ileus, and 2 potentially radiation-induced tumors were 
found. The majority of radiation-related comorbidities found on imaging scans 
were clinically silent.

Sarcopenia is an age-related disease in which muscle mass, strength and function 
may decline with age or can be secondary to cachexia or malnutrition and can 
lead to weakness, falls and even death. With the increase in life expectancy, 
sarcopenia has become a major threat to the health of the elderly. Currently, 
our understanding of bone-muscle interactions is not limited to their mechanical 
coupling. Bone and muscle have been identified as secretory endocrine organs, 
and their interaction may affect the function of each. Both muscle-derived 
factors and osteokines can play a role in regulating muscle and bone metabolism 
via autocrine, paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. Herein, we comprehensively 
summarize the latest research progress on the effects of the osteokines FGF-23, 
IGF-1, RANKL and osteocalcin on muscle to explore whether these cytokines can be 
utilized to treat and prevent sarcopenia.

OBJECTIVE: While there are a number of benefits to minimally invasive surgery 
(MIS) for women with ovarian cysts, there is an increased risk of ovarian 
capsule rupture during the procedure, which could potentially seed the abdominal 
cavity with malignant cells. We developed a decision model to compare the risks, 
benefits, effectiveness and cost of MIS versus laparotomy in women with ovarian 
masses.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness study POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 10 000 women 
with ovarian masses who were undergoing surgical management.
METHODS: The initial decision point in the model was performance of surgery via 
laparotomy or a MIS approach. Model probabilities, costs and utility values were 
derived from published literature and administrative data sources. Extensive 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cost-effectiveness of MIS 
versus laparotomy for women with a pelvic mass measured by incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: MIS was the least costly strategy at $7,732 per women on average, 
compared with $17,899 for laparotomy. In our hypothetical cohort of 10 000 
women, there were 64 cases of ovarian rupture in the MIS group and 53 in the 
laparotomy group, while there were 26 cancer-related deaths in the MIS group and 
25 in the laparotomy group. MIS was more effective than laparotomy (188 462 
QALYs for MIS versus 187 631 quality adjusted life years [QALYs] for 
laparotomy). Thus, MIS was a dominant strategy, being both less costly and more 
effective than laparotomy. These results were robust in a variety of sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: MIS constitutes a cost-effective management strategy for women with 
suspicious ovarian masses.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: MIS is a cost-effective management strategy for women with 
suspicious ovarian masses.

PURPOSE: The life expectancy of people with haemophilia is increasing due to 
improved medical care. This improvement is accompanied by the co-morbidities of 
ageing, which include musculoskeletal degeneration and the associated effect on 
proprioception and balance. This study aims to explore the views and everyday 
experiences of those living with haemophilia regarding this.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine people with moderate or severe haemophilia aged 
43-58 years participated in semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis was 
used to examine the data.
RESULTS: Participants described pain and reduced movement in joints as a result 
of repeated bleeds, which caused problems with mobility and balance. Constant 
vigilance of their surroundings together with the potential consequences of 
bleeds caused continual worry. Participants were resourceful in their strategies 
to cope with the effects of haemophilia, to reduce pain and to minimise the risk 
of falling. However, participants felt stigmatised because of their condition.
CONCLUSION: People with haemophilia have difficulties with their mobility and 
balance that can increase their risk of falling. Healthcare professionals need 
to understand and address the physical and psycho-social factors that contribute 
to the risk of falls. A multi-disciplinary approach to devise effective 
strategies to counteract and monitor the risk of falls would be 
useful.Implications for RehabilitationHealthcare professionals should identify 
movements that are fearful and work on ways to increase confidence and ability 
to perform these.Healthcare professionals need to identify the recovery 
strategies used to maintain balance and build these movements into home exercise 
programmes.Effective pain reduction strategies, both pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological, need to be investigated and optimised.Footwear choice has 
implications for both pain reduction and balance and should be discussed in 
routine reviews.Optimising vision would maximise visual input to aid balance.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a significant health threat and 
reduce both people's life expectancy and quality of life. Healthy living is a 
key component in the effective prevention and treatment of CVD. However, health 
care professionals (HCPs) experience difficulties in supporting lifestyle 
changes among their patients. eHealth can provide a solution to these barriers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide insights into the factors HCPs find 
important in the support of patients with CVD in the uptake of and adherence to 
a healthy lifestyle and the perceived facilitators of and barriers to using 
eHealth to provide lifestyle support to patients with CVD.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Dutch HCPs specializing in 
lifestyle support in cardiac care.
RESULTS: We identified 13 themes, of which the first 12 concerned lifestyle 
support in general and were related to intervention, patient, or health care. 
Throughout these themes, the use of eHealth reoccurred as a potential 
facilitator of or solution to barriers to lifestyle support. Our final theme 
specifically concerned barriers to the adoption and usability of eHealth.
CONCLUSIONS: HCPs do recognize the potential advantages of eHealth while 
experiencing barriers to using digital tools. Incorporating their needs and 
values in the development of lifestyle support programs, especially eHealth, 
could increase their use and lead to a more widespread adoption of eHealth into 
health care.

Combination antiretroviral therapy has completely changed the landscape of HIV 
infection through the control of viral replication of the virus, the restoration 
of the immune system damage, and the reduction of the complications associated 
with immunodeficiency. As a consequence, the average age of people living with 
HIV has been increasing progressively, with a high proportion of diagnosed, as 
well as newly diagnosed, HIV-infected patients being older than 50 years 
throughout the world. With the longer life expectancy, characteristics commonly 
observed in aging are occurring in people with long-term HIV infection, 
including multiple chronic diseases, changes in cognitive and physical 
abilities, and the use of multiple medications. HIV-related specific factors, as 
well as a higher prevalence of environmental, classical factors, increase the 
risk of comorbidities in the aging HIV-infected population. A close 
collaboration between different specialists (HIV specialists, geriatricians, 
primary care physicians, and other specialists) is required to manage the 
clinical problems that older HIV-infected patients may present.

Life expectancy in people living with HIV has increased in the past decades, 
since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment. Increased 
survival comes along with new challenges for the HIV physician, as these 
patients will present comorbidities inherent to ageing that can appear more 
frequently and at younger age than the general population. The older HIV patient 
poses a unique challenge, as management should take into account different 
factors, some related to global ageing such as geriatric syndromes, traditional 
risk factors, social vulnerability, and age-related diseases, and others related 
to HIV infection like ART toxicity, drug-drug interactions, immune dysregulation 
and chronic inflammation. All the above can amount to great polypharmacy and 
multimorbidity that physician have to be aware of. Little is known about the 
best screening, management and treatment strategies to improve long-term health 
outcomes in this ageing population. The following article briefly reviews the 
main comorbidities that can affect the ageing HIV patient.

OBJECTIVE: Stroke remains a leading cause of premature death, impairment and 
reduced quality of life. Its aftercare is performed by numerous different health 
care service providers, resulting in a high need for coordination. Personally 
delivered patient navigation (PN) is a promising approach for managing pathways 
through health care systems and for improving patient outcomes. Although PN in 
stroke care is evolving, no summarized information on its cost-effectiveness in 
stroke survivors is available. Hence, the aim of this systematic review is to 
analyze the level of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PN for stroke 
survivors.
METHODS: A systematic literature search without time limitations was carried out 
in PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL as well as PsycINFO and supplemented by a 
manual search. Randomized controlled trials published prior to April 2020 in 
English or German were considered eligible if any results regarding the 
cost-effectiveness of PN for stroke survivors were reported. The review was 
conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Quality of included studies was 
assessed with the RoB2 tool. Main study characteristics and cost-effectiveness 
results were summarized and discussed.
RESULTS: The search identified 1442 records, and two studies met the inclusion 
criteria. Quality of included studies was rated moderate and high. Programs, 
settings and cost-effectiveness results were heterogeneous, with one study 
showing a 90% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 
$25600 per QALY (health/social care perspective) and the other showing similar 
QALYs and higher costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Since only two studies were eligible, this review reveals a large 
gap in knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness of PN for stroke survivors. 
Furthermore, no conclusive statement about the cost-effectiveness can be made. 
Future attempts to evaluate PN for stroke survivors are necessary and should 
also involve cost-effectiveness issues.

Functional recovery is still limited mainly due to several mechanisms, such as 
the activation of Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) signaling, when human induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PC) are 
transplanted for subacute spinal cord injury (SCI). We previously reported the 
neuroprotective and regenerative benefits of overexpression of lateral olfactory 
tract usher substance (LOTUS), an endogenous NgR1 antagonist, in the injured 
spinal cord using transgenic mice. Here, we evaluate the effects of lentiviral 
transduction of LOTUS gene into hiPSC-NS/PCs before transplantation in a mouse 
model of subacute SCI. The transduced LOTUS contributes to neurite extension, 
suppression of apoptosis, and secretion of neurotrophic factors in vitro. 
In vivo, the hiPSC-NS/PCs enhance the survival of grafted cells and enhance 
axonal extension of the transplanted cells, resulting in significant restoration 
of motor function following SCI. Therefore, the gene transduction of LOTUS in 
hiPSC-NS/PCs could be a promising adjunct for transplantation therapy for SCI.

BACKGROUND: High-resolution data for how mortality and longevity have changed in 
England, UK are scarce. We aimed to estimate trends from 2002 to 2019 in life 
expectancy and probabilities of death at different ages for all 6791 
middle-layer super output areas (MSOAs) in England.
METHODS: We performed a high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of civil 
registration data from the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit research 
database using de-identified data for all deaths in England from 2002 to 2019, 
with information on age, sex, and MSOA of residence, and population counts by 
age, sex, and MSOA. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain estimates of 
age-specific death rates by sharing information across age groups, MSOAs, and 
years. We used life table methods to calculate life expectancy at birth and 
probabilities of death in different ages by sex and MSOA.
FINDINGS: In 2002-06 and 2006-10, all but a few (0-1%) MSOAs had a life 
expectancy increase for female and male sexes. In 2010-14, female life 
expectancy decreased in 351 (5·2%) of 6791 MSOAs. By 2014-19, the number of 
MSOAs with declining life expectancy was 1270 (18·7%) for women and 784 (11·5%) 
for men. The life expectancy increase from 2002 to 2019 was smaller in MSOAs 
where life expectancy had been lower in 2002 (mostly northern urban MSOAs), and 
larger in MSOAs where life expectancy had been higher in 2002 (mostly MSOAs in 
and around London). As a result of these trends, the gap between the first and 
99th percentiles of MSOA life expectancy for women increased from 10·7 years 
(95% credible interval 10·4-10·9) in 2002 to reach 14·2 years (13·9-14·5) in 
2019, and for men increased from 11·5 years (11·3-11·7) in 2002 to 13·6 years 
(13·4-13·9) in 2019.
INTERPRETATION: In the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic, life expectancy 
declined in increasing numbers of communities in England. To ensure that this 
trend does not continue or worsen, there is a need for pro-equity economic and 
social policies, and greater investment in public health and health care 
throughout the entire country.

BACKGROUND: Surgical management of the triceps during exposure for total elbow 
arthroplasty (TEA) is critical to a successful outcome. Previously described 
techniques include elevating the triceps insertion from one side or leaving the 
triceps insertion attached and dislocating the joint. Another approach to the 
elbow, first described in 1933 by Willis Campbell, MD, and subsequently modified 
by George Van Gorder, MD, involves turning down the triceps tendon without 
disrupting the triceps insertion. This approach offers complete visualization of 
the joint and provides excellent exposure for TEA. Only the original report of 
the technique and a small series of patients using this technique for TEA exist 
in the literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate outcomes of the Van 
Gorder approach in a large series of patients undergoing TEA.
METHODS: All patients who underwent TEA from 2008 to 2016 were retrospectively 
reviewed. Only patients who underwent primary TEA performed through the Van 
Gorder approach with at least 6 months' follow-up were included for analysis. 
Patients with prior elbow surgery were excluded. Demographic data, indication 
for surgery, postoperative range of motion, triceps function, and need for 
additional surgery were recorded. Prospectively collected visual analog scale 
(VAS) and Global Health Quality of Life scores were also analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 53 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 62 
years, 81% were female, and the average follow-up was 30.2 months. The most 
common surgical indications included inflammatory arthritis (47%), 
osteoarthritis (24%), and fracture (19%). Postoperatively, average elbow arc of 
motion was an 8°-137°. There was 1 patient (1.89%) who developed failure of 
their triceps extension mechanism. A total of 10 patients (19%) underwent 
additional elbow surgery most commonly for superficial wound complications. 
Preoperative VAS scores decreased significantly, starting at 3 months 
postoperatively (6.76 to 3.37, P < .001), and remained constant at the 12- and 
24-month postoperative visits.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study evaluating the Van Gorder surgical 
approach to the elbow for primary TEA with an average follow-up of 32 months. 
Overall rates of triceps failure and reoperation are consistent with other 
approaches for TEA.

Defining clinically significant tumor size in vestibular schwannoma to inform 
timing of microsurgery during wait-and-scan management: moving beyond minimum 
detectable growth.

OBJECTIVE: Detection of vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth during observation 
leads to definitive treatment at most centers globally. Although ≥ 2 mm 
represents an established benchmark of tumor growth on serial MRI studies, 2 mm 
of linear tumor growth is unlikely to significantly alter microsurgical 
outcomes. The objective of the current work was to ascertain where the magnitude 
of change in clinical outcome is the greatest based on size.
METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of a consecutive series of 
patients with sporadic VS who underwent microsurgical resection between January 
2000 and May 2020 was performed. Preoperative tumor size cutpoints were defined 
in 1-mm increments and used to identify optimal size thresholds for three 
primary outcomes: 1) the ability to achieve gross-total resection (GTR); 2) 
maintenance of normal House-Brackmann (HB) grade I facial nerve function; and 3) 
preservation of serviceable hearing (American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and 
Neck Surgery class A/B). Optimal size thresholds were obtained by maximizing 
c-indices from logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Of 603 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 502 (83%) had tumors with 
cerebellopontine angle (CPA) extension. CPA tumor size was significantly 
associated with achieving GTR, postoperative HB grade I facial nerve function, 
and maintenance of serviceable hearing (all p < 0.001). The optimal tumor size 
threshold to distinguish between GTR and less than GTR was 17 mm of CPA 
extension (c-index 0.73). In the immediate postoperative period, the size 
threshold between HB grade I and HB grade > I was 17 mm of CPA extension 
(c-index 0.65). At the most recent evaluation, the size threshold between HB
