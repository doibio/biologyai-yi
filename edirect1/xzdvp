million[402.0-477.0 million] in 2019. In 2019, global age-standardized 
prevalence rate stood at 5282.8/100,000[4853.6-5752.1], varying from 
2174.5/100,000[1924.3-2470.5] in Mongolia to 19876.8/100,000[18211.1-21795.3] in 
American Samoa. SDI exhibited inverted-U shaped relationship with country-level 
age-standardised rates. Globally, high body-mass-index (51.9%), ambient 
particulate matter pollution (13.6%), smoking (9.9%) and secondhand smoke (8.7%) 
were the major contributing risk factors towards T2DM DALYs in 2019.
CONCLUSION: With ubiquitously rising prevalent cases globally, particularly in 
low and middle-income countries and regions, T2DM requires immediate attention 
and targeted policy response worldwide centered on lifestyle interventions 
(e.g., physical activity, smoking, diet, and obesity), air pollution control and 
cost-effective timely treatment.

The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of 
different methods of resistance training (RT) on functional capacity in older 
adults. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, SPORTDiscus, 
Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov databases, from 
inception to December 2021. Eligibility criteria consisted of randomised control 
trials (RCT's) involving maximal-intent resistance training (MIRT), where 
participants (aged 60+) had specific instruction to move 'as fast as possible' 
during the concentric phase of the exercise. Twelve studies were included within 
the meta-analysis. Divided into functional capacity and strength-related 
outcomes; Improvements were evident for timed-up-and-go (p = 0.001, SMD: - 1.74 
[95% CI - 2.79, - 0.69]) and knee extension one-repetition maximum (1RM) 
(p = 0.01, SMD: - 1.21, [95% CI - 2.17, - 0.25]), both in favour of MIRT, as 
well as in 30 s sit-to-stand in favour of T-STR (p = 0.04, SMD: 3.10 [95% CI 
0.07, 6.14]). No statistical significance was found for combined functional 
capacity outcomes (p = 0.17, SMD: - 0.84, [95% CI - 2.04, 0.37]), with 
near-significance observed in strength-related outcomes (p = 0.06. SMD: - 0.57, 
[95% CI - 1.16, 0.02]) favouring MIRT. Heterogeneity for FC-outcomes was 
observed as Tau2 = 4.83; Chi = 276.19, df = 14, I2 = 95%, and for 
strength-outcomes Tau2 = 1.290; Chi = 109.65, df = 115, I2 = 86%. Additionally, 
MIRT elicited substantial clinically meaningful improvements (CMI) in Short 
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores but fell short of CMI in 400 m walk 
test by 0.6 s. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the lack of 
sufficient and quality evidence for maximal- versus submaximal-intent resistance 
training on functional capacity and strength in community-dwelling older adults. 
Study limitations revolved around lack of research, low quality ("low" PEDro 
score), and largely due to the fact many comparison studies did not match their 
loads lifted (1500 kg vs. 500 kg), making comparisons not possible.

BACKGROUND: tumor recurrence after NSCLC surgical resection is the most common 
cause of treatment failure that sharply reduces the patient's life expectancy. 
The optimal treatment strategy for loco-regional recurrences developing after 
surgical resection in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not 
established yet. This report aims to describe the pattern of relapse, PFS, and 
OS in patients treated with radio-chemotherapy and durvalumab for loco-regional 
relapse after surgery.
METHODS:  We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study including subjects who 
underwent surgical resection for NSCLC and were treated with Pacific protocol 
after loco-regional relapse.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. At the time of 
diagnosis mean age was 65 years (range 47-78), the majority being male (58.3%). 
The 12-month progression-free survival rate was 68.7%, the 18-month 
progression-free survival rate was 45.8%, and the 24-month progression-free 
survival rate was 34.3%. There were three deaths: the 12-month survival rate was 
91%, and the 18-month survival rate was 82.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we propose a treatment strategy that might prolong 
post recurrence survival in patients with good performance status experiencing 
loco-regional relapse after surgery.

Chili powder is a widely used spice with pungent taste, often consumed on a 
daily basis in several countries. Recent prospective cohort studies showed that 
the regular use of chili pepper improves healthspan in humans. Indeed, chili 
pepper fruits contain phenolic substances which are structurally similar to 
those that show anti-aging properties. The objective of our study was to test 
whether consumption of chili-supplemented food by the fruit fly, Drosophila 
melanogaster, would prolong lifespan and in which way this chili-supplemented 
food affects animal metabolism. Chili powder added to food in concentrations of 
0.04%-0.12% significantly extended median lifespan in fruit fly cohorts of both 
genders by 9% to 13%. However, food supplemented with 3% chili powder shortened 
lifespan of male cohorts by 9%. Lifespan extension was accompanied by a decrease 
in age-independent mortality (i.e., death in early ages). The metabolic changes 
caused by consumption of chili-supplemented food had a pronounced dependence on 
gender. A characteristic of both fruit fly sexes that ate chili-supplemented 
food was an increased resistance to cold shock. Flies of both sexes had lower 
levels of hemolymph glucose when they ate food supplemented with low 
concentrations of chili powder, as compared with controls. However, males fed on 
food with 3% chili had lower levels of storage lipids and pyruvate reducing 
activity of lactate dehydrogenase compared with controls. Females fed on this 
food showed lower activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, as well as lower 
ADP/O ratios, compared with control flies.

Gardening has the potential to improve health and wellbeing, especially during 
crises. Using an international survey of gardeners (n = 3743), this study aimed 
to understand everyday gardening experiences, perspectives and attitudes during 
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Our qualitative reflexive 
thematic and sentiment analyses show that during the first months of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, gardening seemed to create a safe and positive space where 
people could socially connect, learn and be creative. Participants had more time 
to garden during the pandemic, which led to enhanced connections with family 
members and neighbours, and the ability to spend time in a safe outdoor 
environment. More time gardening allowed for innovative and new gardening 
practices that provided enjoyment for many participants. However, our research 
also highlighted barriers to gardening (e.g. lack of access to garden spaces and 
materials). Our results illustrate the multiple benefits of gardening apparent 
during COVID-19 through a lens of the social-ecological model of health.

The impact of malnutrition on infant mortality and life expectancy in Africa.

This study analyzes the impact of malnutrition on infant mortality and life 
expectancy in a sample of 36 African countries during the 2003 to 2018 period. 
The economic implications of malnutrition are examined through the vicious cycle 
of poverty, malnutrition, low productivity, and further malnutrition. It was 
hypothesized that malnutrition at infancy contributes to high mortality and 
leads to lower labor productivity in adults through the reduction of their life 
span, because more and more skilled laborers leave sooner. The results of the 
two-way, fixed-effect panel model strongly showed that mild or moderate 
malnutrition reduces infant mortality, whereas severe malnutrition leads to an 
increase in deaths among children under 5 y. The results show a mitigated impact 
of malnutrition on life expectancy. Also, growth in the gross domestic product 
significantly reduced the infant mortality rate, but any increase in income per 
capita was not followed by a reduction of death in children. Thus, it is 
recommended 1) to strengthen the entire health system and infrastructure, 2) to 
promote nutritional training programs, and 3) to reinforce the fight against 
infectious diseases that mostly affect children.

BACKGROUND: The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption 
continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some 
health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall 
risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, 
sex, and year.
METHODS: For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response 
relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical 
minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the 
consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a 
non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and 
territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years 
and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population 
consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.
FINDINGS: The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by 
region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied 
between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0·603 (0·400-1·00) standard drinks 
per day, and the NDE varied between 0·002 (0-0) and 1·75 (0·698-4·30) standard 
drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted 
relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged 
from 0·114 (0-0·403) to 1·87 (0·500-3·30) standard drinks per day and an NDE 
that ranged between 0·193 (0-0·900) and 6·94 (3·40-8·30) standard drinks per 
day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59·1% 
(54·3-65·4) were aged 15-39 years and 76·9% (73·0-81·3) were male.
INTERPRETATION: There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol 
consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly 
those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial 
global health loss attributable to alcohol.

BACKGROUND: Tralokinumab, as monotherapy or in combination with topical 
corticosteroids (TCS), has exhibited marked efficacy through 52 weeks in phase 3 
trials of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and additional 
efficacy in a long-term extension trial. Early changes in patient-reported 
symptoms have not been communicated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) across 
the ECZTRA 1, 2, and 3 tralokinumab trials.
METHODS: Monotherapy data (ECZTRA 1 + 2) was pooled; ECZTRA 3 evaluated 
tralokinumab plus optional TCS. The PROs were assessed through the trials.
RESULTS: A total of 1596 and 380 patients were randomized in ECZTRA 1 and 2 and 
ECZTRA 3, respectively. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were 
similar between groups. Early separation from placebo was observed in percentage 
improvement in worst average daily pruritus numerical rating score (NRS) (week 
1, ECZTRA 1 + 2; week 2, ECZTRA 3) and from day 2 in ECZTRA 1 and 2 daily data. 
More tralokinumab-treated patients achieved clinically meaningful improvements 
(≥ 4 points) in NRS by week 2 (ECZTRA 1 + 2) or week 3 (ECZTRA 3) vs placebo. 
Improvements in eczema-related sleep NRS were seen within 2 weeks (week 1, 
ECZTRA 1 + 2; week 2, ECZTRA 3), supported by similar improvements in other 
sleep measures. Meaningful changes in Dermatology Life Quality Index were 
observed from week 2 (ECZTRA 1 + 2). Results were supported by numerical 
differences from placebo in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure total score (week 2, 
both data sets).
CONCLUSION: Tralokinumab with or without TCS exhibited early and clinically 
meaningful improvements vs placebo in several PROs, which may be beneficial to 
patients because atopic dermatitis symptom relief is a key treatment concern for 
patients.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Historically, spine surgeons used expected postoperative 
survival of 3-months to help select candidates for operative intervention in 
spinal metastasis. However, this cutoff has been challenged by the development 
of minimally invasive techniques, novel biologics, and advanced radiotherapy. 
Recent studies have suggested that a life expectancy of 6 weeks may be enough to 
achieve significant improvements in postoperative health-related quality of 
life.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a model capable of predicting 
6-week mortality in patients with spinal metastases treated with radiation or 
surgery.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective review was conducted at five large 
tertiary centers in the United States and Taiwan.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The development cohort consisted of 3,001 patients undergoing 
radiotherapy and/or surgery for spinal metastases from one institution. The 
validation institutional cohort consisted of 1,303 patients from four 
independent, external institutions.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 6-week mortality.
METHODS: Five models were considered to predict 6-week mortality, and the model 
with the best performance across discrimination, calibration, decision-curve 
analysis, and overall performance was integrated into an open access web-based 
application.
RESULTS: The most important variables for prediction of 6-week mortality were 
albumin, primary tumor histology, absolute lymphocyte, three or more spine 
metastasis, and ECOG score. The elastic-net penalized logistic model was chosen 
as the best performing model with AUC 0.84 on evaluation in the independent 
testing set. On external validation in the 1,303 patients from the four 
independent institutions, the model retained good discriminative ability with an 
area under the curve of 0.81. The model is available here: 
https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/spinemetssurvival/.
CONCLUSIONS: While this study does not advocate for the use of a 6-week life 
expectancy as criteria for considering operative management, the algorithm 
developed and externally validated in this study may be helpful for preoperative 
planning, multidisciplinary management, and shared decision-making in spinal 
metastasis patients with shorter life expectancy.

There is a need for more effective clinical interventions to assist individuals 
in healing from lingering negative and traumatic experiences. Furthermore, 
healing from such experiences and coping with residual symptoms are 
conceptionally separate yet important outcomes in psychotherapy. This report 
describes a Phase I investigation that evaluates an innovative integrative 
psychotherapy technique that promotes healing in addition to providing a method 
of coping while treatment is in progress. 43 patients were treated by 2 separate 
psychologists using Heart Assisted Therapy (HAT) in their private practices. 
There was a total of 81 specific upsetting and/or traumatic life events treated. 
All patients completed a standardized form to rate their degree of distress 
before and after HAT for each life event. Follow-up data were also collected 
ranging from 3 months to over 18 months post-treatment. Data analysis revealed 
the average number of HAT sessions for a treated incident was 3 - 4. The mean 
distress level was 7.55 before HAT and 0.00 after HAT for an exploratory study 
(n=13; p < .0000001), and 8.31 before HAT and 0.02 after HAT for a confirmatory 
study (n = 30; p < .0000001). These improvements were replicated across 
therapists, gender, and veteran status. The combined findings suggest that the 
integrative Heart Assisted Therapy model has important practical as well as 
theoretical significance. Future Phase II and Phase III studies can be performed 
to confirm the large magnitude of the patients perceived clinical effects and 
evaluate potential moderating variables such as expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Larotrectinib is the first tumour-agnostic therapy that has been 
approved by the European Medicines Agency. Tumour-agnostic therapies are 
indicated for a multitude of tumour types. The economic models supporting 
reimbursement submissions of tumour-agnostic therapies are complex because of 
the multitude of indications per model.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
larotrectinib compared with standard of care in patients with cancer with 
tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion-positive tumour types in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A previously constructed cost-effectiveness model with a partitioned 
survival approach was adapted to the Dutch setting, simulating costs and effects 
of treatment in patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion-positive 
cancer. The cost-effectiveness model conducts a naïve comparison of 
larotrectinib to a weighted comparator standard-of-care arm. Dutch specific 
resource use and costs were implemented and inflated to reflect 2019 euros. The 
analysis includes a lifetime horizon and a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Larotrectinib versus Dutch standard of care resulted in 5.61 
incremental (QALYs) and €232,260 incremental costs, leading to an incremental 
cost-effectivenes ratio of €41,424/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
reveals a 88% chance of larotrectinib being cost effective compared with the 
pooled comparator standard-of-care arm at the applicable €80,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold in the Netherlands.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectivenes ratio was well below the 
applicable threshold for diseases with a high burden of disease in the 
Netherlands (€80,000). At this threshold, larotrectinib was estimated to be a 
cost-effective treatment for patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase 
fusion-positive cancer compared with current standard of care in the 
Netherlands.

Currently, individuals living in rural and remote areas experience 1.4 times the 
total burden of chronic disease, including an 80% greater risk of late-life 
cognitive impairment and dementia, 2.5 times the number of preventable 
hospitalisations and a reduced life expectancy of up to 12 years compared to 
their metropolitan counterparts. Traditionally, health service planning and 
public health interventions have been largely built on the needs and 
characteristics of metropolitan populations. This disproportional focus can 
contribute to significant physical and cognitive health status disparities for 
rural and remote communities. This article focuses on existing challenges and 
strategies surrounding the cognitive health of rural and remote populations and 
provides short and long-term opportunities involving Australian public health 
policy and clinical practice to innovate dementia prevention for rural and 
remote communities.

C1 -selective deuteration of aromatic aldehydes is of great importance for 
isotopic labeling and for improving the characteristics of drug molecules. Due 
to the recent increase in the use of deuterated pharmacological drugs, there is 
a pressing need for synthetic procedures that are efficient to produce 
deuterated aromatic aldehyde analouges. Deuterium labeling approaches are 
typically used as an effective tool for researching pharmaceutical absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Furthermore, deuterium-labeled 
pharmaceuticals are intended to increase therapeutic effectiveness and reduce 
side effects by extending the half-life of drug response. In the last few years, 
several catalytic or non-catalytic methods have been developed to synthesize 
deuterated aromatic aldehydes. In this concern, we offer a brief overview of the 
various synthetic strategies and practical methods for the formyl-selective 
deuterium labeling of aromatic aldehydes using different deuterium sources.

Vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) are a prevailing concern among the adult 
population, despite availability of vaccines. Unlike pediatric vaccination 
programs, adult vaccination programs lack the required reach, initiative, and 
awareness. Clinical studies and real-world data have proven that vaccines 
effectively reduce the disease burden of VPDs and increase life expectancy. In 
Tunisia and Morocco, the national immunization program (NIP) focuses more on 
pediatric vaccination and have limited vaccination programs for adults. However, 
some vaccination campaigns targeting adults are organized. For example, 
influenza vaccination campaigns prioritizing at risk adults which includes 
healthcare professionals, elderly, and patients with comorbidities. Women of 
childbearing age who have never been vaccinated or whose information is 
uncertain are recommended to receive tetanus vaccination. Tunisia NIP recommends 
rubella vaccine mainly for women of childbearing age, while in Morocco, national 
vaccination campaigns were organized for girls and women (up to 24 years of age) 
to eliminate rubella. Further, travelers from both countries are recommended to 
follow all requirements and recommendations in the travel destination. The 
objective of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the global disease 
burden of common VPDs including (but not limited to) meningococcal diseases, 
pneumococcal diseases, hepatitis, and influenza. The review also provides an 
overview of clinical data and guidelines/recommendations on adult vaccination 
practices, with special focus on Tunisia and Morocco. Some European and North 
American countries have concrete recommendations and strategies for adult 
vaccination to keep the VPDs in check. In Morocco and Tunisia, although, there 
are sporadic adult vaccination initiatives, the efforts still need upscaling and 
endorsements to boost vaccination awareness and uptake. There is a need to 
strengthen strategies in both countries to understand the disease burden and 
spread awareness. Additional studies are needed to generate economic evidence to 
support cost-effectiveness of vaccines. Integration of private and public 
healthcare systems may further improve vaccination uptake in adults.

Asian countries have shown remarkable progress in financial inclusion and have 
become the world's fastest-growing regions. However, the financial 
inclusion-human health nexus has not received much attention. This study 
contributes to the empirical literature by examining the effect of financial 
inclusion on population health using panel data from Asian countries from 2007 
to 2019. Population health is measured by death rate and life expectancy at 
birth. Our study finding shows that digital financial inclusion increases life 
expectancy but decreases the death rate in Asia. At the same time, financial 
inclusion positively impacts life expectancy and has a negative impact on the 
death rate in Asia. Finding also suggests that Internet users, GDP, and FDI have 
improved population health by increasing life expectancy and decreasing the 
death rate. The results suggest some essential policy implications.

Life expectancy is a significant indicator of public health, life quality, 
welfare and economic development. Therefore, improvement in life expectancy is 
among the priority targets of the countries. This paper investigates the effect 
of economic freedom and educational attainment on life expectancy in the new EU 
member states, experiencing an institutional, educational, and economic 
transformation, during the period 2000-2019 by using cointegration and causality 
tests, because economic freedom and educational attainment can foster the life 
expectancy through institutional and economic variables such as institutions, 
governance, sound monetary and fiscal policies, economic growth, innovation, 
technological development, better living standards and access to superior
