associated with higher ΔQALYs than other interventions. PM interventions for 
neoplasms brought higher ΔNMB than PM interventions for other conditions. 
Nonetheless, average ΔNMB in the 'neoplasm' group was found to be negative.
CONCLUSIONS: PM brings improvements in health but often at a high cost, 
resulting in 0 to negative ΔNMB on average. Pricing policies may be needed to 
reduce the costs of interventions with negative ΔNMB.

Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in men 
worldwide and the life expectancy for men with prostate cancer is improving due 
to advancements in diagnostics and treatment. Male hypogonadism is associated 
with obesity, diabetes, and other comorbidities and also has been linked with 
increasing age; the primary therapy modality for this condition is testosterone 
replacement therapy (TRT). There are concerns that testosterone therapy may 
cause prostate cancer disease progression. However, contemporary evidence 
suggests that testosterone replacement therapy may be safe in specific groups of 
patients with prostate cancer. This chapter will summarise the contemporary 
literature regarding TRT use in hypogonadal men with prostate cancer, including 
limitations and future research goals.

Neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are the two most 
common neurocutaneous disorders, both transmitted as autosomal dominant or, in 
the case of NF, also as a mosaic condition. The causative genetic mutations in 
these neurocutaneous disorders can lead to benign skin changes or uninhibited 
growth and proliferation in multiple organ systems due to the loss of tumor 
suppression in mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of 
rapamycin signaling pathways. Common clinical features in NF include pigmented 
lesions, known as café au lait patches, neurofibromas, intertriginous freckles 
(Crowe's sign), and benign fibrous growths, such as hamartomas in multiple organ 
systems. Common clinical features in TSC include hypopigmented macules, known as 
ash leaf spots, in addition to neurologic sequelae, such as autism, seizures, 
and developmental delays. Advances in genetic sequencing technologies have 
allowed an exponential expansion in the understanding of NF and TSC. Consensus 
criteria have been established for both diagnoses that can be confirmed in most 
cases through gene testing. Once diagnosed, the clinical and diagnostic value of 
disease-specific surveillance include early identification of benign and 
malignant tumors. Genetic counseling is important for informed reproductive 
decision-making for patients and at-risk family members. The improvement in 
understanding of pathways of pathogenic disease development and oncogenesis in 
both conditions have produced a new series of therapeutic options that can be 
used to control seizures and tumor growth. Tremendous advances in life 
expectancy and quality of life are now a reality due to early introduction of 
seizure control and novel medications. While we lack cures, early institution of 
interventions, such as seizure control in tuberous sclerosis, appears to be 
disease-modifying and holds immense promise to offer patients better lives.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent and disabling disease that 
is the source of significant direct and indirect costs. The current recommended 
therapeutic strategy is based on the rapid introduction of therapy with 
conventional Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) combined with 
regular disease monitoring by the rheumatologist. The onerous nature of such 
intense monitoring has motivated the development of new, less demanding 
strategies such as telemedicine. This study aimed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of the connected monitoring of RA patients initiating a new 
DMARD therapy versus conventional monitoring.
METHODS: An economic evaluation based on a randomized controlled trial of 89 
patients was conducted. The patients in the intervention group (n=45) were 
monitored using a connected monitoring interface on a smartphone, while patients 
in the control group (n=44) were conventionally monitored. Health outcomes were 
measured as the gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), assessed using the 
EuroQol-5D questionnaire. Resource use and health outcomes were collected 
alongside the trial and at the six-month follow-up using application data and 
the related clinical case manager time, visits, hospitalisations, and transport 
records. These outcomes were valued using externally collected data on unit 
costs and QALY weights.
RESULTS: Compared to conventionally monitored patients, patients receiving 
connected monitoring had a slightly greater but not significant gain in the 
average QALY of 0.07. The economic analysis found that connected monitoring 
resulted in a significant cost reduction of 72€ (2927€ vs. 2999€, P&lt;0.01). 
The incremental cost-utility ratio of the intervention was equal to -1,029€ per 
QALY (95% CI: -32,033; +24,625) with a 97.8% chance of being cost-effective at a 
threshold of 30,000€ per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Implementing EULAR recommendations for RA patients initiating a 
DMARD treatment using connected monitoring is more efficient and less expensive 
than conventional care.

There is significant individual human suffering and economic burden because of 
untreated mental health and substance use disorders. There is high psychiatric 
morbidity in primary and secondary medical care. At least one-fifth of patients 
attending primary care services in western countries pertain to mental health 
and one-third of patients attending general hospitals have a comorbid mental 
disorder. Patients with mental disorders have lower life expectancy than the 
general population due to various medical conditions and reduced access to 
physical healthcare. There is a suicide every 40 seconds and the vast majority 
of those who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental disorder. Despite this, 
most countries spend less than 2% of their health budgets on mental health. 
Effective treatments exist for mental disorders, however underfunding, poor 
integration of services, lack of trained health care professionals and stigma 
often prevent access to effective treatments. Stigma is a significant barrier to 
seeking help and receiving treatment. Geographical separation of mental health 
services from general hospital settings may be perpetuating the stigma of mental 
illness among the population. In this article, we review the key reasons why 
mental health services globally need to align with mainstream healthcare 
services and the longstanding reasons that necessitate the need to make mental 
health a public health priority.

Vacuum-packed lamb produced in Australia has a shelf-life of 80-90 days under 
export conditions (-1 to 0 °C). However, access to some markets could involve 
>90 days transit time. Studies to understand the potential mechanisms of 
microbial spoilage of vacuum-packed lamb are, therefore, important to assist the 
development of shelf-life extension methods. Here, we investigated the effects 
of glucose on the shelf-life of vacuum-packed lamb. This was done by adding 
glucose (up to 4.64 mmol/kg) to the surface of meat and conducting a series of 
shelf-life trials, in which the sensorial qualities, bacterial growth, pH, and 
residual glucose and lactic acid were measured over time. Based on sensory 
analysis glucose extended the shelf-life, ranging from 8% to >76% increase 
relative to the control. Glucose reduced meat pH, potentially affecting the 
microbial community composition and the accumulation of spoilage metabolites. 
These results indicate that glucose plays an important role in microbial 
spoilage of vacuum-packed lamb possibly by pH reduction.

Aim: To evaluate which treatment attributes US patients and oncologists 
prioritize in HER2 negative advanced breast cancer (ABC). Methods: Preferences 
were assessed via a discrete choice experiment. Also, treatment goal statements 
were rated on an agreement scale. Results: Patients (n = 169) most valued 
improving overall survival (OS), followed by improving nausea and neuropathy. 
Oncologists (n = 117) most valued improving OS, followed by neuropathy and 
progression-free survival. Regarding treatment goals, oncologists (67%) 
perceived that patients are more focused on efficacy than quality of life; fewer 
patients (29%) agreed with this statement; 81% of oncologists and 51% of 
patients agreed that patients prefer oral treatment. Conclusion: Patients and 
oncologists were willing to accept increases in toxicities in exchange for 
efficacy improvements in HER2 negative ABC.

Plain Language Summary: The goal of this study was to understand the preferences 
of patients and physicians for the benefits and risks associated with 
the treatment of advanced breast cancer that expresses normal amounts of the 
HER2 protein (termed as HER2 negative). Respondents completed an exercise where 
they compared two treatment options at a time that varied in their level of 
effectiveness and their potential for certain side effects and then selected the 
treatment option they most preferred. From this exercise, the treatment features 
that matter the most to patients and physicians were discovered. The most 
important treatment features for patients were lengthening life expectancy, 
decreasing the chance of experiencing nausea affecting appetite, and decreasing 
the chance of experiencing nerve damage involving numbness and/or pain, possibly 
severe, in hands and feet which may limit daily activities. The most important 
treatment features for physicians were lengthening life expectancy, decreasing 
the change of experiencing nerve damage involving numbness and/or pain, possibly 
severe, in hands and feet which may limit daily activities, and lengthening the 
time that cancer remains stable and does not worsen. Patients and physicians 
also rated how much they agreed with statements about their goals for treatment. 
While 67% of oncologists believed that their patients are more focused on 
killing the cancer than their quality of life, only 27% of patients were more 
focused on killing the cancer than their quality of life.

Obtaining high-quality value-added bread with extended shelf-life by utilizing 
food industry by-products that would have minimal negative effect on gluten 
structure while avoiding the usage of synthetic preservatives, was the challenge 
of this study. For this purpose the influence of the combination of carob pod 
flour (C, 0-15%), sugar beet fibers (F, 0-10%) and sugar beet molasses (M, 0-6%) 
on dough rheology and bread quality was investigated. Selected materials were of 
good microbiological quality, while carob flour and sugar beet fibers were rich 
in dietary fibers (43.6% and 67.0%, respectively). The presence of high share of 
dietary fibers (combination of C and F) increased dough resistance to extension 
up to 2.5 times, while dough extensibility was reduced by 50%. The addition of 
molasses had less pronounced single effect on dough properties however its 
impact in combination with fiber-rich materials outweighed the individual effect 
(an increase of dough resistance at about 55%). Molasses alone and in 
combination with other ingredients had positive effect on bread quality. Sample 
M6F5 attained crumb quality score (6.0 of maximum 7.0) higher than in control 
sample (5.6). High share of C and F reduced loaf volume and crumb quality of 
bread up to 56% and 50%, respectively and increased hardness 7.5 times. However, 
carob flour (7.5%) increased polyphenols content and antioxidant capacity 3 and 
4 times, respectively. Moreover, carob flour and molasses and their combination 
showed inhibitory effect on mold mycelia growth and spores formation. Regarding 
all of the above, C7.5M3F5 was chosen as optimal sample.

Development and Evaluation of Competitive Inhibitors of Trastuzumab-HER2 Binding 
to Bypass the Binding-Site Barrier.

Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States.

Our group has developed and experimentally validated a strategy to increase 
antibody penetration in solid tumors through transient inhibition of 
antibody-antigen binding. In prior work, we demonstrated that 1HE, an 
anti-trastuzumab single domain antibody that transiently inhibits trastuzumab 
binding to HER2, increased the penetration of trastuzumab and increased the 
efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2+ xenograft bearing mice. 
In the present work, 1HE variants were developed using random mutagenesis and 
phage display to enable optimization of tumor penetration and efficacy of 
trastuzumab-based therapeutics. To guide the rational selection of a particular 
1HE mutant for a specific trastuzumab-therapy, we developed a mechanistic 
pharmacokinetic (PK) model to predict within-tumor exposure of 
trastuzumab/T-DM1. A pharmacodynamic (PD) component was added to the model to 
predict the relationship between intratumor exposure to T-DM1 and the 
corresponding therapeutic effect in HER2+ xenografts. To demonstrate the utility 
of the competitive inhibition approach for immunotoxins, PK parameters specific 
for a recombinant immunotoxin were incorporated into the model structure. 
Dissociation half-lives for variants ranged from 1.1 h (for variant LG11) to 
107.9 h (for variant HE10). Simulations predicted that 1HE co-administration can 
increase the tumor penetration of T-DM1, with inhibitors with longer trastuzumab 
binding half-lives relative to 1HE (15.5 h) further increasing T-DM1 penetration 
at the expense of total tumor uptake of T-DM1. The PK/PD model accurately 
predicted the response of NCI-N87 xenografts to treatment with T-DM1 or T-DM1 
co-administered with 1HE. Model predictions indicate that the 1HE mutant HF9, 
with a trastuzumab binding half-life of 51.1 h, would be the optimal inhibitor 
for increasing T-DM1 efficacy with a modest extension in the median survival 
time relative to T-DM1 with 1HE. Model simulations predict that LG11 
co-administration will dramatically increase immunotoxin penetration within all 
tumor regions. We expect that the mechanistic model structure and the wide range 
of inhibitors developed in this work will enable optimization of 
trastuzumab-cytotoxin penetration and efficacy in solid tumors.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options and surgical decision for grade 3-4 gonarthrosis 
remains controversial. We aimed to compare the pain level, muscle strength, 
physical performance, lower extremity functions, and other physical activity 
levels between patients who underwent arthroplasty and those who received 
conservative management for grade 3-4 gonarthrosis.
METHODS: This prospective analytical observational study was conducted in a 
tertiary referral hospital. A total of 30 unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 
(UKA) and 30 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients as two different study 
groups and 30 patients were treated conservatively as the control group were 
included. The rehabilitation and complication rates were recorded. The values of 
the range of motion, quadriceps diameter, were measured and also the isokinetic 
muscle strength, pick-up, repeated sit-to-stand, stair ascending and descending, 
straight-line walking, timed up and go, and 20-m walk tests, the knee injury and 
osteoarthritis-outcome-score (KOOS), the hospital for special-surgery-knee-score 
(HSS), and Oxford-Knee-Score (OKS) were performed.
RESULTS: Postoperative rehabilitation and complication rates were significantly 
higher in the TKA group compared to the UKA group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.026, 
respectively). Six months after the treatment, the knee extension muscle 
strength value at 180°/s, knee flexion degree, total work flexion, stair 
ascending, VAS at night, all KOOS symptom, pain and daily function and total 
scores in the UKA group was significantly different than the TKA and the control 
groups (p < 0.001). Total work extension values, knee flexion degree, in the 
control group were found to be significantly higher than the TKA group 
(p = 0.033, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The UKA was significantly superior to TKA and conservative 
treatment concerning pain, muscle strength, and quality of life.

Introduction The marked increase in life expectancy seen in Portugal in the last 
five decades led to a change in the profile of patients being most commonly 
admitted in internal medicine wards. In deciding the best care for these 
patients, prognostication models are needed in order to reduce readmissions, 
mortality, and adequate care. We aimed to study short and long-term mortality 
and predictors of all-cause mortality, independently of cause admission, of 
patients admitted in an internal medicine ward. Methods This two-part, 
single-center study enrolled patients from October 2013 to October 2014 with a 
follow-up of 60 months. Results A total of 681 patients were included; the mean 
age was 75.86 years with 60.4% females. The most frequent comorbidities were 
anemia, hypertension, and renal impairment. More than half of the population 
died in the follow-up period (51.5%). Deaths were significantly higher in the 
first six months after discharge (53% of all deaths) and then decreased abruptly 
to 11.6% in the second half-year after discharge. Based on the multivariate 
logistic regression model, with age over 80 years, anemia and neoplasm were 
independent predictors of short-term (p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, respectively) 
and long-term (p<0.001 for the three conditions) mortality. Heart failure 
(p=0.018) and diabetes (p=0.025) were also predictors of long-term mortality. 
Conclusion High mortality, mainly in the first six months after discharge, 
elicits strategies targeting transition of care and close follow-up in the first 
months, which can be the key to improving outcomes. Identification of patients 
at higher risk may help design realistic models aiming to improve care for this 
frail population and decrease morbimortality.

Cervical thymic cysts are relatively rare benign cystic lesions that tend to be 
diagnosed clinically as branchial cysts, which usually present as painless, 
enlarging neck masses. They can occur anywhere along the normal path of descent 
of thymic primordia from the angle of the mandible to the sternal notch, with 
mediastinal extension observed in approximately 50% of cases. They are usually 
seen in the first decade of life on the left side with a male predominance. Here 
we report a case of a 15-year-old boy who presented to the hospital with 
left-sided neck swelling for about 2 months. The neck's contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography (CECT) revealed a large, well-defined cystic swelling in the 
left neck region, showing peripheral enhancement, seen from the submandibular 
region to the superior mediastinum extending into the retrosternal region. 
Direct fine needle aspiration (FNA) was done, which showed a benign lesion with 
inflammatory and cystic characteristics, leading to the possibility of a 
branchial cyst. The cyst was completely excised surgically. Histopathology 
showed a thymic cyst with parathyroid tissue. The presence of thymic tissue with 
Hassall's corpuscles is essential for the diagnosis. Knowledge of the clinical 
presentation, cyto-histological findings, and differential diagnosis of cystic 
cervical lesions in the pediatric population is important to diagnose this rare 
entity. Hence, though uncommon, when one comes across a cystic cervical region 
mass in children, a diagnosis of cervical thymic cyst should be kept in mind. 
Nonetheless, a definitive diagnosis depends on imaging findings as well as 
intraoperative findings and histopathological examination.

PURPOSE: This study explored the effects of Health Qigong exercise on lower limb 
motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with PD were recruited and randomly 
allocated into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental 
group completed an intervention of Health Qigong exercise over 12 weeks, while 
the control group did not perform any regular physical activity. Data relating 
to gait, lower-limb joint range of motion, Timed Up and Go, as well as scores 
for motor function scale from the Unified Parkinson's Comprehensive Rating Scale 
III (UPCRS III) before and after the intervention were collected for Repeated 
Measure ANOVA.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, Health Qigong exercise improved the 
constant- and high-speed stride length and gait velocity of patients, but not 
constant- and high-speed stride frequency. Left and right hip flexion and 
extension range were improved as well as left and right knee flexion range. 
Finally, Timed Up and Go time became significantly slower and UPCRS III score 
significantly decreased.
CONCLUSION: Health Qigong exercise can improve walking ability and lower limb 
joint range of motion in patients with PD, lessen motor difficulties, and 
improve the quality of life. This non-pharmacological exercise intervention may 
be a useful adjustment treatment for PD.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is an important risk factor for disability and dependency 
at old age. The prevalence of sarcopenia among the Chilean older population is 
high.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy, healthy life expectancy and unhealthy 
life expectancy among sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults from Santiago, 
Chile.
METHODS: A sample of 1,897 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or 
more, living in Santiago, was observed between 5-15 years. Disability was 
defined as the unhealthy state, assessed through self-reported difficulties in 
activities of daily living. Sarcopenia was determined via HTSMayor software. 
Total and marginal life expectancies were estimated using the Interpolated 
Markov Chain method "IMaCh".
RESULTS: At 60 years, estimated life expectancy for sarcopenic and 
non-sarcopenic older adults was similar (22.7 and 22.5 years, respectively). The 
proportion of years to be lived with disability was three times greater in 
sarcopenic adults, compared to non-sarcopenic people. This difference was 
observed up to 80 years. Non-sarcopenic women had a higher proportion of years 
to be lived with disabilities compared to non-sarcopenic men of the same age, 
but this proportion was higher among sarcopenic men, compared to sarcopenic 
women until 70 years of age.
DISCUSSION: People with sarcopenia expect to live a higher proportion of years 
with disabilities. Sarcopenic men until 70 years expected to live a higher 
proportion of years with disability, compared to sarcopenic women. Monitoring 
sarcopenia among older people may help to identify individuals with higher risk 
of disability onset. Future research should focus on disentangling the 
mechanisms explaining sex differences.

BACKGROUND: Blood testosterone concentrations in women decline during the 
reproductive years and reach a nadir in the seventh decade, after which 
concentrations increase and are restored to those of reproductive-aged women 
early in the eighth decade. We aimed to establish the association between the 
concentration of testosterone in the blood and risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in healthy older women.
METHODS: SHOW was a prospective cohort substudy of the longitudinal randomised 
ASPREE trial. Eligible participants were women aged at least 70 years from 
Australia with unimpaired cognition, no previous MACE, and a life expectancy of 
at least 5 years. Participants who were receiving hormonal or steroid therapy 
were ineligible for inclusion. We measured serum concentrations of sex steroids 
with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and of SHBG with 
immunoassay. We compared lower concentrations of sex hormones with higher 
concentrations using four quartiles. Primary endpoints were risk of MACE and 
all-cause mortality, the associations of which with sex steroid concentrations 
were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression that included age, 
body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidaemia, impaired renal function, and treatment allocation in the ASPREE 
trial (aspirin vs placebo). ASPREE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT01038583.
FINDINGS: Of the 9180 women recruited to the ASPREE trial between March 10, 
2010, and Dec 31 2014, 6358 participants provided sufficient biobank samples at 
baseline and 5535 were included in the final analysis. Median age at entry was 
74·0 years (IQR 71·7-77·7). During a median 4·4 years of follow-up (24 553 
person-years), 144 (2·6%) women had a first MACE (incidence 5·9 per 1000 
person-years). During a median 4·6 years of follow-up (3·8-5·6), 200 women died 
(7·9 per 1000 person-years). In the fully adjusted models, higher concentrations 
of testosterone were associated with a lower incidence of MACE (quartile 4 vs 
quartile 1: hazard ratio 0·57 [95% CI 0·36-0·91]; p=0·02), as were higher 
concentrations of DHEA (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: 0·61 [0·38-0·97]; p=0·04). For 
oestrone, a lower risk of MACE was seen for concentrations in quartile 2 only, 
compared with quartile 1 (0·55 [0·33-0·92]; p=0·02). In fully adjusted models, 
no association was seen between SHBG and MACE, or between any hormone or SHBG 
and all-cause mortality.
INTERPRETATION: Blood concentrations of testosterone and DHEA above the lowest 
quartile in older women were associated with a reduced risk of a first-ever 
MACE. Given that the physiological effects of DHEA are mediated through its 
steroid metabolites, if the current findings were to be replicated, trials 
investigating testosterone therapy for the primary prevention of ischaemic 
cardiovascular disease events in older women would be warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a form of adult-onset epilepsy 
where presenting features are well described, but little is known regarding 
prognosis. This study aimed to elucidate the long-term prognosis of TEA 
regarding seizure control, memory, medical comorbidities, and life expectancy.
METHODS: Up-to-date clinical information was collected for 47 people diagnosed 
with TEA who had joined the The Impairment of Memory in Epilepsy (TIME) study 
10 years earlier. At entry to the study, information about comorbid conditions 
was systematically collected. Details regarding subsequent diagnoses, seizure 
activity, changes to treatment, or reports of cognitive impairment were obtained 
through the family doctor. The variables of interest were compared with UK 
population data.
RESULTS: Mortality in the cohort was 21 of 47 (45%), with an average age at 
death of 82.5 years. Seizures remained well controlled for the majority but 
medications required adjustments in dose and type for some (28%). A small number 
(three cases) remained seizure-free without medication. History of 
cardiovascular disorders was frequent (78.7%), typically involving hypertension 
(55.3%). Autoimmune disorders (25.5%), cancer (23.4%), and depression (21.3%) 
were also commonly reported. Although persisting memory problems were often 
noted, dementia was diagnosed in seven cases (14.9%). Life expectancy and 
comorbidities in TEA did not differ from available population norms.
SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that life expectancy is not reduced in TEA. 
Although TEA does not appear to be a self-limiting form of epilepsy, seizures 
are typically well controlled via medication. Because adjustments to medication 
may be required, even after long periods of stability, ongoing medical 
monitoring is recommended. Comorbid vascular disorders are frequent but appear 
similar to general population estimates. Monitoring mood may be important, given 
that people with chronic conditions are often vulnerable to depression. Because 
of persisting memory difficulties, the development of effective memory 
interventions for people with TEA is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Advances in healthcare systems with new therapeutic options improve 
the life expectancy of patients with neuromuscular diseases. With this, a shift 
in the phenotype of the diseases from the neuromuscular system towards other 
organs is more frequently observed, requiring closer interdisciplinary 
cooperation in caring for these young adults. Therefore, the transition to the 
adult caring system is nowadays a multilayered transfer with the need for 
complex care of these patients.
OBJECTIVE: How can the transitional process be efficiently structured to combine 
the therapeutic effort of each specialist discipline involved and improve the 
healthcare process and quality of life in young adults with neuromuscular 
diseases?
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Departments of Neuropediatrics and Neurology of the 
University Medicine Essen established the Essen transition model for 
a structured transitional process. A concept of care was developed for the late 
onset Pompe's disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and juvenile myasthenia 
gravis representatively for neuromuscular diseases. It consists of four 
components: 1) In a standardized operational procedure (SOP), general processes, 
clinical diagnostic steps and guidance of treatment between the two departments 
are harmonized and specified. 2) The young adults and their relatives are seen 
in a joint consultation of both disciplines allowing a comprehensive handover 
for healthcare professionals. 3) In a quarterly meeting, transition conference 
representatives from the different specialized disciplines from pediatric and 
adult medicine get together for a case-related interdisciplinary exchange. 4) An 
interdepartmental transitional database was created to integrate all diagnostic 
results and parameters as a common information platform and data basis.
CONCLUSION: The Essen transition model aims to close a gap in the transition of 
patients with neuromuscular diseases and improve healthcare in these patients 
with their complex needs.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Durch die Optimierung medizinischer 
Versorgungsstrukturen und die gravierenden Fortschritte bei der Entwicklung 
neuer Therapieverfahren wird ein Anstieg der Lebenserwartung bei Patienten mit 
neuromuskulären Erkrankungen beobachtet. Dies führt zu einer Erweiterung des 
phänotypischen Spektrums, wodurch neue bzw. bislang wenig relevante 
Krankheitsmanifestationen in unterschiedlichen Organsystemen an Bedeutung 
gewinnen. Die Betreuung jugendlicher und junger Erwachsener mit neuromuskulären 
Erkrankungen verlangt daher eine zunehmend enge interdisziplinäre 
Zusammenarbeit.
FRAGESTELLUNG: Wie kann der Transitionsprozess von der Pädiatrie in die 
Erwachsenenmedizin so strukturiert werden, dass die einzelnen Fachdisziplinen 
effizient in den komplexen Behandlungs- und Versorgungsprozess eingebunden und 
die Lebensqualität der Patienten verbessert werden?
MATERIAL UND METHODE: An der Universitätsmedizin Essen wurde ein strukturierter 
Transitionsprozess etabliert. Exemplarisch wurde anhand des Morbus Pompe („late 
onset M. Pompe“ [LOPD]), der Duchenne-Muskeldystrophie (DMD) und der juvenilen 
Myasthenia gravis (jMG) ein entsprechendes Versorgungskonzept entwickelt. Dies 
umfasst vier Elemente: 1) Mit der Einführung klinikübergreifender SOPs 
(„standard operating procedure“) werden die logistischen Abläufe sowie die 
diagnostischen und therapeutischen Maßnahmen einheitlich abgestimmt und der 
Transitionsprozess verbindlich festgelegt. 2) Um einen nahtlosen Übergang zu 
gewährleisten, werden junge Patienten vor Erreichen des 17. Geburtstages mit 
ihren Eltern im Zuge gemeinsamer Transitionssprechstunden betreut. Dies schafft 
die Möglichkeit des gegenseitigen Kennenlernens und der Bildung eines 
nachhaltigen Vertrauensverhältnisses. 3) Ein quartalsweise stattfindendes 
„Transitionsboard“ bringt die beteiligten Fachdisziplinen aus Kinder- und 
Erwachsenenmedizin für einen fallbezogenen interdisziplinären Austausch und eine 
stetige Optimierung des Transitionsprozesses regelmäßig zusammen. 4) Als 
gemeinsame Informationsplattform und Datengrundlage wurde eine 
klinikübergreifende „Transitionsdatenbank“, in der medizinische Befunde und 
Verlaufsparameter erfasst werden, implementiert.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Mit dem Essener Transitionsmodell soll die Versorgungslücke 
junger Patienten mit neuromuskulären Erkrankungen während der kritischen 
Übergangsphase von der Kinder- zur Erwachsenenmedizin geschlossen und die 
Grundlage für eine erfolgreiche Weiterbehandlung im Erwachsenenalter geschaffen 
werden.

Extensive use of the herbicide glyphosate leads to a high detection rate in the 
environment and potential risks to nontarget aquatic life. China ranks first 
globally in the production and consumption of glyphosate, but there are no 
glyphosate water quality criteria (WQCs) for protecting aquatic life. Here, data 
on the acute and chronic toxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate-based 
formulations (GBFs) to freshwater aquatic life were collected and screened. 
Significant differences in species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and toxicity 
values for acute or chronic toxicity were found between glyphosate and GBFs. The 
hazardous concentrations for 5% of species (HC5) of glyphosate or GBFs between 
native and nonnative species were different, and native species were found to be 
more sensitive to the toxicity of glyphosate. The acute and chronic WQCs derived 
with the SSD method for glyphosate based on the toxicity data for native species 
in China were 3.35 and 0.26 mg/L, respectively, and those found for GBFs were 
0.21 and 0.005 mg/L, respectively. The WQCs in this study were quite different 
from those estimated using similar statistical extrapolation methods in other 
countries, which reflects the differences in species sensitivity to glyphosate 
toxicity in different regions. The hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated based 
on the WQCs and concentrations of glyphosate in some surface waters in China and 
indicated that glyphosate exhibits medium or high hazard risk in some samples of 
Tai Lake, surface water in Guiyang, fishpond water in Chongqing, rural drinking 
water, and surface water and reservoir water in Henan Province. The WQCs of 
glyphosate and GBFs have scientific significance for the exposure and pollution 
control of herbicide formulations and the protection of aquatic life in China.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a debilitating autoimmune disease 
characterized by severe lung outcomes resulting in reduced life expectancy. 
Fra-2-transgenic mice offer the opportunity to decipher the relationships 
between the immune system and lung fibrosis. This study was undertaken to 
investigate whether the Fra-2-transgenic mouse lung phenotype may result from an 
imbalance between the effector and regulatory arms in the CD4+ T cell 
compartment.
METHODS: We first used multicolor flow cytometry to extensively characterize 
homeostasis and the phenotype of peripheral CD4+ T cells from Fra-2-transgenic 
mice and control mice. We then tested different treatments for their 
effectiveness in restoring CD4+ Treg cell homeostasis, including adoptive 
transfer of Treg cells and treatment with low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2).
RESULTS: Fra-2-transgenic mice demonstrated a marked decrease in the proportion 
and absolute number of peripheral Treg cells that preceded accumulation of 
activated, T helper cell type 2-polarized, CD4+ T cells. This defect in Treg 
cell homeostasis was derived from a combination of mechanisms including impaired 
generation of these cells in both the thymus and the periphery. The impaired 
ability of peripheral conventional CD4+ T cells to produce IL-2 may greatly 
contribute to Treg cell deficiency in Fra-2-transgenic mice. Notably, adoptive 
transfer of Treg cells, low-dose IL-2 therapy, or combination therapy changed 
the phenotype of Fra-2-transgenic mice, resulting in a significant reduction in 
pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the lungs.
CONCLUSION: Immunotherapies for restoring Treg cell homeostasis could be 
relevant in SSc. An intervention based on low-dose IL-2 injections, as is 
already proposed in other autoimmune diseases, could be the most suitable 
treatment modality for restoring Treg cell homeostasis for future research.
