BACKGROUND: Optimal management of chronic medications for patients with 
life-limiting illness is uncertain. Medication deprescribing may improve 
outcomes in this population, but patient concerns regarding deprescribing are 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the perceived benefits and 
concerns of statin discontinuation among patients with life-limiting illness.
DESIGN: Baseline data from a multicenter, pragmatic clinical trial of statin 
discontinuation were used.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: Cognitively intact participants with a life expectancy of 1-12 
months receiving statin medications for primary or secondary prevention were 
enrolled.
MEASUREMENTS: Responses to a 9-item questionnaire addressing patient concerns 
about discontinuing statins were collected. We used Pearson chi-square tests to 
compare responses by primary life-limiting diagnosis (cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, other).
RESULTS: Of 297 eligible participants, 58% had cancer, 8% had cardiovascular 
disease, and 30% other primary diagnoses. Mean (standard deviation) age was 72 
(11) years. Fewer than 5% of participants expressed concern that statin 
deprescribing indicated physician abandonment. About one in five participants 
reported being told to take statins for the rest of their life (18%) or feeling 
that discontinuation represented prior wasted effort (18%). Many participants 
reported benefits of stopping statins, including spending less money on 
medications (63%), potentially stopping other medications (34%), and having a 
better quality of life (25%). More participants with cardiovascular disease as a 
primary diagnosis perceived that quality-of-life benefits related to statin 
discontinuation (52%) than participants with cancer (27%) or noncardiovascular 
disease diagnoses (27%) [p = 0.034].
CONCLUSION: Few participants expressed concerns about discontinuing statins; 
many perceived potential benefits. Cardiovascular disease patients perceived 
greater potential positive impact from statin discontinuation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Availability of directly-acting antivirals (DAAs) has changed 
the treatment landscape of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The high price of 
DAAs has restricted their use in several countries. However, in some countries 
such as India, generic DAAs are available at much cheaper price. This study 
examined whether generic DAAs could be cost-saving and how long it would take 
for the treatment to become cost-saving/effective.
METHODS: A previously-validated, mathematical model was adapted to the 
HCV-infected population in India to compare the outcomes of no treatment versus 
treatment with DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from published studies. 
Cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using available DAAs was calculated, using a 
payer's perspective. We estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), total costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of DAAs versus no treatment. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, the use of generic DAAs in Indian HCV 
patients would increase the life expectancy by 8.02 years, increase QALYs by 
3.89, avert 19.07 DALYs, and reduce the lifetime healthcare costs by $1,309 
per-person treated. Treatment became cost-effective within 2 years, and 
cost-saving within 10 years of its initiation overall and within 5 years in 
persons with cirrhosis. Treating 10,000 HCV-infected persons could prevent 
3400-3850 decompensated cirrhosis, 1800-2500 HCC, and 4000-4550 liver-related 
deaths. The results were sensitive to the costs of DAAs, pre- and post-treatment 
diagnostic tests and management of cirrhosis, and quality of life after 
sustained virologic response.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with generic DAAs available in India will improve patient 
outcomes, provide a good value for money within 2 years, and be ultimately 
cost-saving. Therefore, in this and similar settings, HCV treatment should be a 
priority from a public health as well an economic perspective.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important defense molecules of the innate 
immune system. High levels of AMPs are induced in response to infections to 
fight pathogens, whereas moderate levels induced by metabolic stress are thought 
to shape commensal microbial communities at barrier tissues. We expressed single 
AMPs in adult flies either ubiquitously or in the gut by using the inducible 
GeneSwitch system to tightly regulate AMP expression. We found that activation 
of single AMPs, including Drosocin, resulted in a significant extension of 
Drosophila lifespan. These animals showed reduced activity of immune pathways 
over lifetime, less intestinal regenerative processes, reduced stress response 
and a delayed loss of gut barrier integrity. Furthermore, intestinal Drosocin 
induction protected the animals against infections with the natural Drosophila 
pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila, whereas a germ-reduced environment prevented 
the lifespan extending effect of Drosocin. Our study provides new insights into 
the crosstalk of innate immunity, intestinal homeostasis and ageing.

Currently, nanoparticles are widely used in biomedicine and industry. CuO 
nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) are versatile materials in our daily life and their 
toxicity has drawn extensive attention. In this study, we concentrate on the 
effect of CuO-NPs on early zebrafish development. The results reveal that 
CuO-NPs can induce abnormal phenotypes of a smaller head and eyes and delayed 
epiboly. The gene expression pattern shows that CuO-NPs spatially narrow the 
expression of dorsal genes chordin and goosecoid and alter the expression of 
dlx3, ntl and hgg which are related to the cell migration of gastrulation. The 
decreased expression of pax2 and pax6 involved in neural differentiation was 
accordant with the decreased sizes of neural structures. Cmlc2 expression 
suggests that CuO-NPs prevented looping of the heart tube during cardiogenesis. 
Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR results suggest that the CuO-NPs could increase 
the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to narrow the expression of chordin and 
goosecoid in dorsoventral patterning as well as decrease the transcription of 
Wnt5 and Wnt11 to result in slower, less directed movements and an abnormal cell 
shape. These findings indicated the CuO-NPs exert developmental toxicity. The 
present study evaluates the ecological and developmental toxicity, providing 
warnings about the application of CuO-NPs.

BACKGROUND: Until recently, standard treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
concerned a combination of short-term low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and 
long-term vitamin-K antagonist (VKA). Risk of bleeding and the requirement for 
regular anticoagulation monitoring are, however, limiting their use. Rivaroxaban 
is a novel oral anticoagulant associated with a significantly lower risk of 
major bleeds (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.79) compared 
to LMWH/VKA therapy, and does not require regular anticoagulation monitoring.
AIMS: To evaluate the health economic consequences of treating acute VTE 
patients with rivaroxaban compared to treatment with LMWH/VKA, viewed from the 
Dutch societal perspective.
METHODS: A life-time Markov model was populated with the findings of the 
EINSTEIN phase III clinical trial to analyze cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban 
therapy in treatment and prevention of VTE from a Dutch societal perspective. 
Primary model outcomes were total and incremental quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), as well as life expectancy and costs.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, rivaroxaban was shown to be dominant, with 
health gains of 0.047 QALYs and cost savings of €304 compared to LMWH/VKA 
therapy. Dominance was robustly present in all sensitivity analyses. Major 
drivers of the differences between the two treatment arms were related to 
anticoagulation monitoring (medical costs, travel costs, and loss of 
productivity) and the occurrence of major bleeds.
CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism 
results in health gains and cost savings compared to LMWH/VKA therapy. This 
conclusion holds for the Dutch setting, both for the societal perspective, as 
well as the healthcare perspective.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of individual 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for post-stroke fatigue and sleep 
disturbance compared to treatment as usual (TAU). In a parallel two-group pilot 
randomised controlled trial of 15 participants, nine were allocated to eight 
weekly sessions of adapted CBT and six continued usual care rehabilitation. The 
primary outcome was the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-7) at two and four months 
from baseline. Secondary outcomes included measures of sleep, mood and quality 
of life. Outcomes were assessed by a rater who was blind to group membership. At 
the four-month endpoint, the CBT group demonstrated significantly reduced 
fatigue relative to TAU (FSS-7 mean difference: 1.92, 95% CI: 0.24 to 3.60). 
Significant group differences also emerged for sleep quality and depression, 
favouring the CBT group. Insomnia and physical quality of life improved 
immediately post-therapy but were no longer superior to TAU at follow-up. 
Overall, CBT is a promising treatment for improving post-stroke fatigue, sleep 
quality and depression. Gains were maintained for two months after therapy 
cessation and represented large treatment effects. These findings highlight the 
feasibility of the intervention and warrant extension to a phase III clinical 
trial.

Children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) with associated intestinal failure may 
be unable to absorb sufficient nutrients to sustain life. Improvements in the 
medical management of SBS, including use of parenteral nutrition, has 
significantly increased life expectancy. Independence from parenteral nutrition 
further improves quality of life. However, children living with SBS often 
develop oral aversions and feeding difficulties. There is limited research and 
information on which to base interventions that will preserve and develop oral 
motor and feeding skills. The aims of this article are to explore what is known 
about children with SBS who exhibit oral aversion/feeding difficulties and to 
suggest research for possible future interventions that could help these 
children overcome oral aversion, eat orally, and increase participation and 
satisfaction in mealtimes. This review explores the complexity of feeding 
children with SBS. Three underlying themes emerged: physical, developmental, and 
social aspects of eating and mealtimes. Interdisciplinary teams are needed to 
effectively address these complex oral feeding problems. Accurate identification 
the underlying issues will allow healthcare providers to develop interventions 
to improve feeding outcomes for children with SBS. Future research should focus 
on evaluating the effectiveness of interventions that address each of the 
underlying issues.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease, which is associated with 
the osteoporotic fracture. Along with prolonged life expectancy, the fracture 
risk increases dramatically with age. So far, it is usually the first choice to 
using antiresorptive agents. However, current clinical therapeutic treatments 
are not enough to inhibit the long-term bone loss and the rising risk of bone 
fractures. Recently, combination and sequential therapies with anti-osteoporosis 
drugs have become an inevitable trend.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to summarize the present knowledge 
related to the combination and sequential therapies with anti-osteoporosis 
drugs.
METHODS: All articles published in PubMed until 2016 on the combination and 
sequential therapies with antiosteoporosis drugs were reviewed and the relevant 
literature was described in this review.
RESULTS: As the first-line therapy for osteoporosis, the long-term safety and 
efficacy on bisphosphonate, teriparatide, and new anti-osteoporosis drugs are 
ongoing concerns. Combination or sequential therapies of boneforming agents and 
anti-resorptive agents, or two kinds of anti-resorptive agents, or strontium 
ranelate and other anti-osteoporosis agents have the advantages on BMD compared 
with monotherapy.
CONCLUSION: So far, it is still an important public health strategy to therapy 
on the osteoporosis and related fracture. Alternatively, the combination and 
sequential therapies with anti-osteoporosis drugs are promising approaches for 
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and have far-reaching significance.

BACKGROUND: With up to 240 million people chronically infected with hepatitis B 
worldwide, including an estimated 2 million in the United States, widespread 
screening is needed to link the infected to care and decrease the possible 
consequences of untreated infection, including liver cancer, cirrhosis and 
death. Screening is currently fraught with challenges in both the developed and 
developing world. New point-of-care tests may have advantages over 
standard-of-care tests in terms of cost-effectiveness and linkage to care. 
Stochastic modeling is applied here for relative utility assessment of 
point-of-care tests and standard-of-care tests for screening.
METHODS: We analyzed effects of point-of-care versus standard-of-care testing 
using Markov models for disease progression in individual patients. Simulations 
of large cohorts with distinctly quantified models permitted the assessment of 
particular screening schemes. The validity of the trends observed is supported 
by sensitivity analyses for the simulation parameters.
RESULTS: Increased utilization of point-of-care screening was shown to decrease 
hepatitis B-related mortalities and increase life expectancy at low projected 
expense.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that standard-of-care screening should be 
substituted by point-of-care tests resulting in improved linkage to care and 
decrease in long-term complications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although arteriovenous fistulas have been found to be 
the most cost-effective form of hemodialysis access, the relative benefits of 
placing an arteriovenous fistula versus an arteriovenous graft seem to be least 
certain for older adults and when placed preemptively. However, older adults' 
life expectancy is heterogeneous, and most patients do not undergo permanent 
access creation until after dialysis initiation. We evaluated cost-effectiveness 
of arteriovenous fistula placement after dialysis initiation in older adults as 
a function of age and life expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using a hypothetical cohort of 
patients on incident hemodialysis with central venous catheters, we constructed 
Markov models of three treatment options: (1) arteriovenous fistula placement, 
(2) arteriovenous graft placement, or (3) continued catheter use. Costs, 
utilities, and transitional probabilities were derived from existing literature. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by age group (65-69, 70-74, 
75-79, 80-84, and 85-89 years old) and quartile of life expectancy. Costs, 
quality-adjusted life-months, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
evaluated for up to 5 years.
RESULTS: The arteriovenous fistula option was cost effective compared with 
continued catheter use for all age and life expectancy groups, except for 85-89 
year olds in the lowest life expectancy quartile. The arteriovenous fistula 
option was more cost effective than the arteriovenous graft option for all 
quartiles of life expectancy among the 65- to 69-year-old age group. For older 
age groups, differences in cost-effectiveness between the strategies were 
attenuated, and the arteriovenous fistula option tended to only be cost 
effective in patients with life expectancy >2 years. For groups for which the 
arteriovenous fistula option was not cost saving, the cost to gain one 
quality-adjusted life-month ranged from $2294 to $14,042.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, the cost-effectiveness of an arteriovenous 
fistula placed within the first month of dialysis diminishes with increasing age 
and lower life expectancy and is not the most cost-effective option for those 
with the most limited life expectancy.

Measuring blood pressure continuously helps monitor health and also prevent 
lifestyle related diseases to extend the expectancy of healthy life. Blood 
pressure, which is nowadays used for monitoring patient, is one of the most 
useful indexes for prevention of lifestyle related diseases such as 
hypertension. However, continuously monitoring the blood pressure is unrealistic 
because of discomfort caused by the tightening of a cuff belt. We have earlier 
researched the data-oriented blood pressure estimation without using a cuff. 
Remarkably, our blood pressure estimation method only uses a photoplethysmograph 
sensor. Therefore, the application is flexible for sensor locations and 
measuring situations. In this paper, we describe the implementation of our 
estimation method, the launch of a cloud system which can collect and manage 
blood pressure data measured by a wristwatch-type photoplethysmograph sensor, 
and the construction of our applications to visualize life-log data including 
the time-series data of blood pressure.

OBJECTIVES: Marital satisfaction has an important effect on people's mental 
health. Due to the increasing average age and life expectancy of Iranian women, 
obtaining knowledge about sexual aspects of post-menopause women for partners 
can improve their health and quality of life. This study aimed to determine the 
effect of education for the husbands regarding menopause on marital satisfaction 
of their wives.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 100 women aged 45 to 
55 years old and their husbands in Yazd in 2014. Subjects were randomly assigned 
to intervention group (50 couples) and control group (50 couples). The data 
gathering tools included two questionnaires, the first one contained questions 
about demographic information of women and men, and the other one was used to 
assess knowledge and practice in men about menopause and Enrich marital 
satisfaction. The second questionnaire was applied twice; before intervention 
and two months after that. In the intervention group an educational program in 
the form of three 60-minute sessions were conducted using speech, but the 
control group received no training. Analysis was performed through the 
statistical SPSS software, paired t-test, t-test and chi-square.
RESULTS: In the intervention group, two months after the educational program the 
knowledge of menopausal health and women's marital satisfaction scores increased 
significantly (P<0.001). But there was no significant difference in control 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Training menopausal health to husbands can increase women's marital 
satisfaction in the period of menopausal transition. Therefore, designing and 
implementing educational programs for husbands is recommended.

Stroke is one of the most important cause of death and disability, especially 
when considering the increasing life expectancy worldwide, with ischemic stroke 
being much more common than hemorrhages. In the physiopathological chain of 
ischemic stroke, brain edema is one first element that if attended to might 
reduce tissue necrosis, penumbra, and increase functional recovery. Aquaporin 4 
(AQP4) has been found to be the most important water channel in the brain, and 
its inhibition before inducing focal ischemia in an animal model of stroke 
proved to alleviate the pathology and improve clinical recovery. In this study, 
we have treated a rat model of ischemic stroke with the AQP4 inhibitor TGN-020 
after inducing the lesion, and performed for the first time a direct 
histopathological evaluation of the brain and infarct's volume. Besides 
utilizing immunohistochemistry targeting the growth-associated protein-43 
(GAP-43) in order to delineate the infarct regions, we have used the Cavalieri's 
principle of tissue volume measurements starting form seriate sections, and for 
the first time in neuropathology, we have utilized a high-resolution object 
scanner to assess global brain volume changes. Our results showed that TGN-020 
clearly reduces infarct volume in TGN-020 treated animals compared to untreated 
animals, as well as the volume of the brain hemispheres. Although reduced, the 
effect was also present in the contralateral hemisphere. Given these data, a 
more in-depth characterization of the histopathological and molecular changes 
induced by AQP-4 are needed for considering it as a bona fide treatment option.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of certolizumab pegol (CZP), a 
pegylated fc-free anti-TNF, as add-on therapy to methotrexate (MTX) versus 
etanercept, adalimumab, or golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not responding to the conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). A Markov model (6-month cycle 
length) assessed health and cost outcomes of CZP versus other anti-TNFs 
recommended for RA in Greece over a patient's lifetime. Following 
discontinuation of first-line anti-TNF, patients switched to second anti-TNF and 
then to a biologic with another mode of action. Sequential use of csDMARDs 
followed third biologic. Clinical data and utilities were extracted from 
published literature. Analysis was conducted from third-party payer perspective 
in Greece. Costs (drug acquisition, administration, monitoring, and patient 
management) were considered for 2014. Results presented are incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) ascertained robustness of base-case 
findings. Base-case analysis indicated that CZP+MTX was more costly and more 
effective compared with Etanercept+MTX (base-case ICER: €3,177 per QALY), whilst 
versus adalimumab/golimumab, CZP was dominant (less costly, more effective). For 
all comparisons, CZP treatment resulted in greater improvements in life 
expectancy and QALYs. PSA indicated that at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€34,000/QALY, CZP+MTX was associated with a 71.6, 97.9, or 99.2% probability of 
being cost-effective versus etanercept, golimumab, or adalimumab, respectively, 
in combination with MTX. This analysis demonstrates CZP+MTX to be a 
cost-effective alternative over Etanercept+MTX and a dominant option over 
Adalimumab+MTX and Golimumab+MTX for management of RA in Greece.

Optimizing the Lee-Carter Approach in the Presence of Structural Changes in Time 
and Age Patterns of Mortality Improvements.

Researchers using the Lee-Carter approach have often assumed that the 
time-varying index evolves linearly and that the parameters describing the age 
pattern of mortality decline are time-invariant. However, as several empirical 
studies suggest, the two assumptions do not seem to hold when the calibration 
window begins too early. This problem gives rise to the question of identifying 
the longest calibration window for which the two assumptions hold true. To 
address this question, we contribute a likelihood ratio-based sequential test to 
jointly test whether the two assumptions are satisfied. Consistent with the 
mortality structural changes observed in previous studies, our testing procedure 
indicates that the starting points of the optimal calibration windows for most 
populations fall between 1960 and 1990. Using an out-of-sample analysis, we 
demonstrate that in most cases, models that are estimated to the optimized 
calibration windows result in more accurate forecasts than models that are 
fitted to all available data or data beyond 1950. We further apply the proposed 
testing procedure to data over different age ranges. We find that the optimal 
calibration windows for age group 0-49 are generally shorter than those for age 
group 50-89, indicating that mortality at younger ages might have undergone 
(another) structural change in recent years.

INTRODUCTION: Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is the first basal insulin 
and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a single pen 
injection device, and a once-daily treatment option for patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are uncontrolled on basal insulin and require 
treatment intensification. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira versus basal-bolus therapy (insulin 
glargine U100 + 3× daily insulin aspart) for patients with T2DM uncontrolled on 
basal insulin [HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (>7%)] in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the validated IMS CORE 
Diabetes Model from a healthcare payer perspective. Outcomes were modeled over 
patient lifetimes in a cohort with baseline characteristics from the DUAL™ II 
trial. Treatment effect data were sourced from a statistical indirect comparison 
(pooled analysis) of IDegLira with basal-bolus therapy.
RESULTS: Treatment with IDegLira resulted in mean increases in quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.43 quality-adjusted life years versus basal-bolus therapy. 
Improved clinical outcomes resulted from fewer diabetes-related complications 
and a delayed time to their onset. IDegLira was associated with lower costs of 
EUR 4679 versus basal-bolus therapy, a result of lower pharmacy costs and 
avoided diabetes-related complications. Thus, IDegLira was dominant, i.e., both 
more effective and less costly than basal-bolus therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira is an effective treatment option to improve glycemic 
control without incurring an increased risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. This 
analysis suggests that IDegLira is cost-effective versus basal-bolus therapy in 
patients with T2DM who are uncontrolled on basal insulin in the Netherlands.

VEGFR and mTOR inhibitors are broadly used in metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC) therapy, and sequential first-line pazopanib (VEGFR inhibitor) and 
second-line everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) is a standard treatment option. 
Nivolumab and lenvatinib/everolimus combination was recently approved in Europe 
for use in mRCC after previous therapy. Prospective routine data on sequential 
therapy including nivolumab and/or lenvatinib are missing. This is a 
prospective, noninterventional study, which evaluates the effectiveness, 
tolerability, safety and quality of life following 450 patients with mRCC 
starting either on pazopanib as first-line therapy or third-line everolimus 
plus/minus lenvatinib following nivolumab. Adults with histologically confirmed 
mRCC of any subtype, who have a life expectancy of at least 6 months, are 
eligible.

Several demographic aspects of population aging in developing countries are 
considered: the older old, the median age of a population, life expectancy and 
mortality, functional status and disability, sex differences, urbanization, and 
the labor force. While the demographic impact of population aging is becoming 
better appreciated, the descriptive epidemiology of age-related changes in 
health and physical functioning in developing countries is still at an early 
stage.

The rapid aging of the population and the steady increase in life expectancy 
around the world is one of the greatest social, economic and political 
transformations of our time. The on-going demographic changes are accompanied by 
a significant increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and 
disabled people. There is still no adequate medical care, as well as access to 
essential medicines and technologies for treatment and prevention of NCDs, what 
leads to disability, loss of productivity and reduction of national income in 
many regions of the world. These trends underline the necessity of developing 
effective measures to promote prosperous aging, which implies, first of all, 
legislative, administrative and other measures, as well as the development of a 
socio-economic strategy and action plan, which will protect interests of elderly 
population.

The offered methodological principles of the geriatric analysis in medicine 
enables to plan economic parameters of social protection of the population, 
necessary amount of medical help financing, to define a structure of the 
qualified medical personnel training. It is shown that personal health and 
cognitive longevity of the person depend on the adequate system geriatric 
analysis and use of biological parameters monitoring in time. That allows 
estimate efficiency of the combined individual treatment. The geriatric analysis 
and in particular its genetic-mathematical component aimed at reliability and 
objectivity of an estimation of the person life expectancy in the country and in 
region due to the account of influence of mutagen factors as on a gene of the 
person during his live, and on a population as a whole.

There is limited evidence available worldwide about the quantitative 
relationship between particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less 
than 10µm (PM10) and years of life lost (YLL) caused by respiratory diseases 
(RD), especially regarding long-term time series data. We investigated the 
quantitative exposure-response association between PM10 and the disease burden 
of RD. We obtained the daily concentration of ambient pollutants (PM10, nitrogen 
dioxide and sulphur dioxide), temperature and relative humidity data, as well as 
the death monitoring data from 2001 to 2010 in Tianjin. Then, a time series 
database was built after the daily YLL of RD was calculated. We applied a 
generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the burden of PM10 on daily YLL of 
RD and to determine the effect (the increase of daily YLL) of every 10μg/m3 
increase in PM10 on health. We found that every 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was 
associated with the greatest increase in YLL of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.23) years 
at a 2-day (current day and previous day, lag01) moving average PM10 
concentration for RD. The association between PM10 and YLL was stronger in 
females and the elderly (≥65 years of age). The association between PM10 and YLL 
of RD differed according to district. These findings also provide new 
epidemiological evidence for respiratory disease prevention.

BACKGROUND: Severe limb ischaemia (SLI) is defined as the presence of rest pain 
and/or tissue loss secondary to lower extremity atherosclerotic peripheral
