BACKGROUND: People with mental illness have a reduced life expectancy compared 
to the general population. Despite the increasing evidence for the efficacy of 
lifestyle interventions there is little change in routine clinical care. This 
discrepancy is often referred to as the implementation gap and has caused a need 
for effectiveness and implementation research in real-world settings. Our study 
assesses the effectiveness and implementation of a multidisciplinary lifestyle 
focused approach in the treatment of inpatients with mental illness (MULTI +).
METHODS: An open cohort stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in inpatients 
psychiatric wards of GGz Centraal, the Netherlands. The wards are divided into 
three clusters based on geographical region. These clusters are randomly 
allocated to one of the three pre-defined steps to integrate MULTI + . 
MULTI + can be tailored to fit individual psychiatric wards and includes 10 core 
components aimed at improving lifestyle factors. The primary outcome is to 
investigate the difference in the mean QRISK3 score of patients receiving 
MULTI + compared to patients receiving TAU. Secondary outcomes include somatic 
and mental health outcomes, lifestyle factors, and implementation factors. 
Findings will be analysed using mixed model analyses.
DISCUSSION: The MULTI + study is the first large-scale study evaluating the 
long-term effects of a multidisciplinary, multicomponent approach aimed at 
improving lifestyle factors in routine inpatient mental health care. A 
limitation of this study is the risk of missing data due to the large-scale, 
real-world setting of this study. Furthermore, implementation monitoring and 
external events that may influence outcomes could be difficult to account for. 
Strengths of this study are the focus on effectiveness as well as implementation 
and the inclusion of both patient and health care professionals' perspectives. 
Effectiveness studies in routine clinical care can advance our knowledge on 
lifestyle interventions in real-world settings.

BACKGROUND: Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been extensively 
favored as a model organism in aging and age-related studies, thanks to 
versatile microfluidic chips for cell dynamics assay and replicative lifespan 
(RLS) determination at single-cell resolution. However, previous microfluidic 
structures aiming to immobilize haploid yeast may impose excessive spatial 
constraint and mechanical stress on cells, especially for larger diploid cells 
that sprout in a bipolar pattern.
RESULTS: We developed a high-throughput microfluidic chip for diploid yeast 
long-term culturing (DYLC), optical inspection and cell-aging analysis. The DYLC 
chip features 1100 "leaky bowl"-shaped traps formatted in an array to dock 
single cells under laminar-perfused medium and effectively remove daughter cells 
by hydraulic shear forces. The delicate microstructures of cell traps enable 
hydrodynamic rotation of newborn buds, so as to ensure bud reorientation towards 
downstream and concerted daughter dissection thereafter. The traps provide 
sufficient space for cell-volume enlargement during aging, and thus properly 
alleviate structural compression and external stress on budding yeast. Trapping 
efficiency and long-term maintenance of single cells were optimized according to 
computational fluid dynamics simulations and experimental characterization in 
terms of critical parameters of the trap and array geometries. Owing to the 
self-filling of daughter cells dissected from traps upstream, an initial 
trapping efficiency of about 70% can rapidly reach a high value of over 92% 
after 4-hour cell culturing. During yeast proliferation and aging, cellular 
processes of growth, budding and daughter dissection were continuously tracked 
for over 60 h by time-lapse imaging. Yeast RLS and budding time interval (BTI) 
were directly calculated by the sequential two-digit codes indicating the 
budding status in images. With the employed diploid yeast strain, we obtained an 
RLS of 24.29 ± 3.65 generations, and verified the extension of BTI in the first 
couple of generations after birth and the last several generations approaching 
death, as well as cell de-synchronization along diploid yeast aging.
CONCLUSIONS: The DYLC chip offers a promising platform for reliable capture and 
culturing of diploid yeast cells and for life-long tracking of cell dynamics and 
replicative aging processes so that grasping comprehensive insights of aging 
mechanism in complex eukaryotic cells.

BACKGROUND: Australians born in 2012 can expect to live about 33 years longer 
than those born 100 years earlier. However, only seven of these additional years 
are spent in the workforce. Longer life expectancy has driven policies to extend 
working life and increase retirement age; the current Australian policy, which 
has increased the eligibility for the pension from 65 to 67 by 2023, assumes 
that an improvement in longevity corresponds with an improvement in healthy life 
expectancy. However, there is mixed evidence of health trends in Australia over 
the past two decades. Although some health outcomes are improving among older 
age groups, many are either stable or deteriorating. This raises a question of 
how health trends intersect with policy for older Australians aged from 50 to 
70. This paper considers the interplay between older workers' health and 
workforce participation rates over the past 15 years when extended workforce 
participation has been actively encouraged.
METHODS: We compared health and economic outcomes of the older people in 
following years with the base year (start of the study period), adjusting for 
some key socio-economic characteristics such as age, sex, ethnicity, education 
and equivalized household income by applying the Random effects estimator with 
maximum likelihood estimation technique.
RESULTS: We find that regardless of increasing longevity, the health of older 
adults aged between 50 and 70 has slightly deteriorated. In addition, health 
gaps between those who were working into their older age and those who were not 
have widened over the 15-year period. Finally, we find that widening health gaps 
linked to workforce participation are also accompanied by rising economic 
inequality in incomes, financial assets and superannuation. With the exception 
of a small group of healthy and very wealthy retirees, the majority of the older 
Australians who were not working had low incomes, assets, superannuation, and 
poor health.
CONCLUSIONS: The widening economic and health gap within older population over 
time indicates a clear and urgent need to add policy actions on income and 
health, to those that seek to increase workforce participation among older 
adults.

Background Life expectancy has been higher for Hispanic versus non-Hispanic 
White (NHW) individuals; however, data are limited on cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) mortality. Method and Results Using the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research death 
certificate database (1999-2018), we compared age-adjusted mortality rates for 
total CVD and its subtypes (ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, 
hypertensive heart disease, other CVD), and average annual percentage changes 
among Hispanic and NHW adults. The age-adjusted mortality rate per 100 000 was 
lower for Hispanic than NHW adults for total CVD (186.4 versus 254.6; P<0.001) 
and its subtypes. Between 1999 and 2018, mortality decline was higher in 
Hispanic than NHW adults for total CVD (average annual percentage change [AAPC], 
-2.90 versus -2.41) and ischemic heart disease (AAPC: -4.44 versus -3.82) 
(P<0.001). In contrast, stroke mortality decline was slower in Hispanic versus 
NHW adults (AAPC: -2.05 versus -2.60; P<0.05). Stroke mortality increased in 
Hispanic but stalled in NHW adults since 2011 (AAPC: 0.79 versus -0.09). For 
ischemic heart disease (AAPC: -0.80 versus -1.85) and stroke (AAPC: -1.32 versus 
-1.43) mortality decline decelerated more for Hispanic than NHW adults aged 
<45 years (P<0.05). For heart failure, Hispanic adults aged <45 (3.55 versus 
2.16) and 45 to 64 (1.88 versus 1.54) showed greater rise in age-adjusted 
mortality rate than NHW individuals (P<0.05). Age-adjusted heart failure 
mortality rate also accelerated in Hispanic versus NHW men (1.00 versus 0.67; 
P<0.001). Conclusions Disaggregating data by CVD subtype and demographics 
unmasked heterogeneities in CVD mortality between Hispanic and NHW adults. NHW 
adults had greater CVD mortality rates and slower decline than Hispanic adults, 
whereas marked demographic differences in mortality signaled concerning trends 
among the Hispanic versus NHW population.

BACKGROUND: Larotrectinib is approved for patients with metastatic TRK fusion 
cancers, including differentiated thyroid (DTC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and 
soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Given the basket clinical trial design of 
larotrectinib, direct comparisons against standard of care in each of the 
mentioned cancers have not been assessed. Also, owing to the limited duration of 
follow-up in clinical trials, long-term outcomes for treatments are generally 
not known or estimated. OBJECTIVE: To compare expected life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients with metastatic DTC, CRC, and 
STS who are eligible to receive larotrectinib against patients with unknown NTRK 
gene fusion status receiving standard-of-care therapy. METHODS: We developed a 
partitioned survival model to estimate the long-term comparative effectiveness 
of larotrectinib and standard of care for 3 tumor types. Larotrectinib survival 
data, assessed by independent review committee, were derived from an updated 
July 2020 analysis of 19, 8, and 23 adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with 
metastatic TRK fusion DTC, CRC, and STS, respectively. The DTC survival data 
also included 2 patients aged less than 18 years for a total of 21 patients. 
Survival estimates for standard of care were derived from published clinical 
trials. Progressionfree and overall survival for all treatments were estimated 
using survival distributions (Exponential, Weibull, Log-logistic, and Lognormal) 
fit to the available data. The final exponential form was selected based on 
goodness-of-fit and clinical plausibility. QALYs were estimated by adjusting the 
time spent in the preprogression and postprogression health states by utility 
weights derived from publicly available literature. RESULTS: Patients receiving 
larotrectinib experienced more LYs and QALYs compared with those receiving 
standard-of-care treatments across all 3 assessed cancer types. In DTC, patients 
receiving larotrectinib had 7.15-8.26 additional LYs (5.87-6.12 QALYs); in CRC, 
patients receiving larotrectinib had 1.26-1.27 additional LYs (1.00 QALYs); and 
in STS, patients receiving larotrectinib had 5.56 additional LYs (1.99 QALYs). 
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard of care in metastatic TRK wild-type cancers, 
larotrectinib is estimated to result in improved LY and QALY outcomes based on 
parametric extrapolations of intrial survival data. Because patient-level data 
were unavailable for adjusted analyses, a cross-trial comparison was performed. 
Given the limitations of this analytic approach and the small sample size for 
larotrectinib in trials, future studies should reassess the comparative 
effectiveness of larotrectinib vs standard of care as treated patients accrue 
and long-term survival data mature. DISCLOSURES: K. Suh, J. Carlson, and S.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer risk and life expectancy vary substantially across 
patients eligible for low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening (LCS), 
which has important consequences for optimizing LCS decisions for different 
patients. To account for this heterogeneity during decision-making, web-based 
decision support tools are needed to enable quick calculations and streamline 
the process of obtaining individualized information that more accurately informs 
patient-clinician LCS discussions. We created DecisionPrecision, a 
clinician-facing web-based decision support tool, to help tailor the LCS 
discussion to a patient's individualized lung cancer risk and estimated net 
benefit.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to test two strategies for implementing 
DecisionPrecision in primary care at eight Veterans Affairs medical centers: a 
quality improvement (QI) training approach and academic detailing (AD).
METHODS: Phase 1 comprised a multisite, cluster randomized trial comparing the 
effectiveness of standard implementation (adding a link to DecisionPrecision in 
the electronic health record vs standard implementation plus the Learn, Engage, 
Act, and Process [LEAP] QI training program). The primary outcome measure was 
the use of DecisionPrecision at each site before versus after LEAP QI training. 
The second phase of the study examined the potential effectiveness of AD as an 
implementation strategy for DecisionPrecision at all 8 medical centers. Outcomes 
were assessed by comparing absolute tool use before and after AD visits and 
conducting semistructured interviews with a subset of primary care physicians 
(PCPs) following the AD visits.
RESULTS: Phase 1 findings showed that sites that participated in the LEAP QI 
training program used DecisionPrecision significantly more often than the 
standard implementation sites (tool used 190.3, SD 174.8 times on average over 6 
months at LEAP sites vs 3.5 SD 3.7 at standard sites; P<.001). However, this 
finding was confounded by the lack of screening coordinators at standard 
implementation sites. In phase 2, there was no difference in the 6-month tool 
use between before and after AD (95% CI -5.06 to 6.40; P=.82). Follow-up 
interviews with PCPs indicated that the AD strategy increased provider awareness 
and appreciation for the benefits of the tool. However, other priorities and 
limited time prevented PCPs from using them during routine clinical visits.
CONCLUSIONS: The phase 1 findings did not provide conclusive evidence of the 
benefit of a QI training approach for implementing a decision support tool for 
LCS among PCPs. In addition, phase 2 findings showed that our light-touch, 
single-visit AD strategy did not increase tool use. To enable tool use by PCPs, 
prediction-based tools must be fully automated and integrated into electronic 
health records, thereby helping providers personalize LCS discussions among 
their many competing demands. PCPs also need more time to engage in shared 
decision-making discussions with their patients.

BACKGROUND: In breast cancer survivors, chemotherapy-induced muscle loss has 
been shown to be attenuated with structured resistance exercise. Creatine 
supplementation can increase bioenergetics in skeletal muscle, which helps to 
improve overall strength and endurance and reduce muscular fatigue. Therefore, 
we hypothesize that adding creatinine supplementation to exercise training will 
accelerate improvements in strength, endurance, and bioenergetics in breast 
cancer survivors.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the effects of combining 
creatine supplementation with exercise on modulating strength and physical 
function in breast cancer survivors by comparing these effects to those of 
exercise alone. The secondary objectives are to determine if creatine 
supplementation and exercise can increase the intramuscular storage of creatine 
and improve body composition by comparing this intervention to exercise alone.
METHODS: We aim to test our hypothesis by conducting an open-label randomized 
controlled trial of 30 breast cancer survivors who have completed chemotherapy 
within 6 months of enrollment. Eligible participants will be equally randomized 
(1:1) to either a creatine and exercise group or an exercise-only group for this 
12-week intervention. Individuals who are randomized to receive creatine will be 
initially dosed at 20 g per day for 7 days to boost the availability of creatine 
systemically. Thereafter, the dose will be reduced to 5 g per day for 
maintenance throughout the duration of the 12-week protocol. All participants 
will engage in 3 center-based exercise sessions, which will involve completing 3 
sets of 8 to 12 repetitions on chest press, leg press, seated row, shoulder 
press, leg extension, and leg curl machines. The primary outcomes will include 
changes in strength, body composition, and physical function in breast cancer 
survivors. The secondary outcomes will be intramuscular concentrations of 
creatine and adenosine triphosphate in the vastus lateralis, midthigh 
cross-sectional area, and quality of life.
RESULTS: As of October 2021, a total of 9 patients have been enrolled into the 
study. No unexpected adverse events have been reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Creatine is being studied as a potential agent for improving 
strength, endurance, and bioenergetics in breast cancer survivors following 
chemotherapy. The findings from our trial may have future implications for 
supporting breast cancer survivors in reversing the muscle loss experienced 
during chemotherapy and improving their physical function and quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: In the United States, autistic individuals experience 
disproportionate physical and mental health challenges relative to non-autistic 
individuals, including higher rates of co-occurring and chronic conditions and 
lower physical, social, and psychological health-related quality of life. The 
Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health (AIR-P) is an 
interdisciplinary, multicenter research network for scientific collaboration and 
infrastructure that aims to increase the life expectancy and quality of life for 
autistic individuals, with a focus on underserved or vulnerable populations. The 
current paper describes the development of the AIR-P Research Agenda.
METHODS: Development of the research agenda involved an iterative and 
collaborative process between the AIR-P Advisory Board, Steering Committee, and 
Autistic Researcher Review Board. The methodology consisted of 3 phases: (1) 
ideation and design, (2) literature review and synthesis; and (3) network 
engagement.
RESULTS: Six core research priorities related to the health of autistic 
individuals were identified: (1) primary care services and quality, (2) 
community-based lifestyle interventions, (3) health systems and services, (4) 
gender, sexuality, and reproductive health, (5) neurology, and (6) genetics. 
Specific topics within each of these priorities were identified. Four 
cross-cutting research priorities were also identified: (1) 
neurodiversity-oriented care, (2) facilitating developmental transitions, (3) 
methodologically rigorous intervention studies, and (4) addressing health 
disparities.
CONCLUSIONS: The AIR-P Research Agenda represents an important step forward for 
enacting large-scale health-promotion efforts for autistic individuals across 
the lifespan. This agenda will catalyze autism research in historically 
underrepresented topic areas while adopting a neurodiversity-oriented approach 
to health-promotion.

The use of edible coatings can lead to significant extension of the postharvest 
life of fresh horticultural products through the regulation of water and gaseous 
exchange during storage. In this regard, nano-engineered materials are of great 
interest to design novel and multifunctional edible coatings and are 
increasingly employed. Chitosan and glycine betaine have been reported to 
enhance fruit tolerance to chilling stress during cold storage. The current 
study applied new coating treatments to plum (Prunus domestica L. cv. 'Stanley') 
fruit at maturity stage in a completely randomized factorial design with three 
replicates. Plums were treated with distilled water (control), glycine betaine 
(GB) at 2.5 and 5 mM, chitosan (CTS) at 1% (w/v) or glycine betaine-coated 
chitosan nanoparticles (CTS-GB NPs) at 0.5 and 1% (w/v) and stored at 1 °C for 
up to 40 days. The application of CTS-GB NPs (0.5% w/v) was the most effective 
treatment and induced lower electrolyte leakage, MDA and H2O2 content, and 
significantly alleviated chilling injury. Furthermore, this treatment remarkably 
increased the activity of PAL enzyme, resulting in higher levels of phenolics, 
flavonoids and anthocyanins content, and enhanced DPPH scavenging capacity. In 
addition, CTS-GB NPs treatment increased endogenous GB (9.25 mg g-1 DW) and 
proline (1929.29 μg g-1 FW) accumulation leading to higher activity of CAT, POD, 
SOD and APX enzymes. Based on the obtained results, the commercial application 
of CTS-GB NPs could effectively reduce chilling injury, preserve nutritional 
quality, and prolong the storage potential and shelf life of plum fruit.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic dizziness can significantly affect quality of 
life, but identifying the underlying cause remains challenging. This study 
focuses on proprioceptive cervicogenic dizziness (CGD) and aims: (1) to compare 
clinical test results between patients with CGD, dizzy patients without CGD, and 
healthy controls; and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic value of the clinical tests 
for CGD in patients with chronic dizziness.
METHODS: Sixty patients with chronic dizziness (18 with CGD and 42 without CGD), 
and 43 healthy controls underwent clinical tests evaluating neck function 
(mobility, proprioception, muscle function and disability), balance control, and 
the presence of visually induced dizziness. Data were analysed through one-way 
ANOVA, chi-square, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Patients with CGD had significantly more neck pain-related disability 
(Neck Bournemouth questionnaire (NBQ), p = 0.006), but better static (Static 
Balance, p = 0.001) and dynamic balance (Tandem Gait, p = 0.049), compared to 
dizzy patients without CGD. Univariable analyses revealed that increased NBQ (OR 
1.05 [1.01; 1.09], p = 0.017), Joint Position Error (JPE) after extension (OR 
1.52 [1.00; 2.32], p = 0.050), and Tandem Gait scores (OR 1.09 [1.01; 1.18], 
p = 0.046) were individually associated with higher odds of having CGD. Their 
optimal cut-off level (based on the maximum Youden index) had high sensitivity 
but low specificity for CGD. The multivariable model, including NBQ and Tandem 
Gait, had fair discriminative ability (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI [0.61; 0.87]).
CONCLUSION: The combined use of the NBQ and Tandem Gait tests had the highest 
discriminative ability to detect CGD in patients with chronic dizziness.

Biodegradable polymers typically have inferior barrier properties compared to 
petroleum-based nonbiodegradable plastic. The addition of zinc oxide 
nanoparticles may enhance the functional properties of biodegradable packaging 
and extends the shelf life of packaged foods. Polybutylene 
adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and thermoplastic starch (TPS) blended ZnO 
(1-5%) nanocomposite films were developed via blown extrusion for functional 
active meat packaging. The nanocomposite film morphology showed agglomeration of 
the nanoparticles, causing poor mechanical properties. Nanovoids formed at the 
interface between the polymer and nanoparticles, increasing permeability. 
Dispersion of ZnO nanofillers modified CO and C-O ester bonding in PBAT and 
increased hydrogen bonding with TPS. The interaction between ZnO and polymers 
increased the dispersion and reduced the agglomeration of nanoparticles. The 
highest ZnO content at 5% resulted in a stronger interaction between ZnO and TPS 
due to increased amorphous starch content, which improved homogeneous dispersion 
within the matrices, reducing nanoparticle size. The ZnO nanocomposite films 
reduced lipid oxidation and delayed microbial growth, resulting in a lower total 
viable count, lactic acid bacteria and yeast and mold in packaged pork meat. 
Higher ZnO concentrations from 3% showed microbial inhibitory effects. The 
growth of microorganisms was controlled by residual oxygen, morphology of the 
films and nanoparticle characteristics. The nanocomposite films effectively 
extended the shelf life by more than 3 days under refrigerated conditions.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to better understand the patient perspective and 
treatment experience of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
METHODS: This qualitative study enrolled adult RRMM patients from 6 US clinics 
who had ≥ 3 months of life expectancy, ≤ 6 prior lines of therapy, and ≥ 1 
treatment regimen with a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulator, or a CD38 
monoclonal antibody or an alkylating agent, and a steroid. In-person 
semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted to capture concepts that 
were relevant and important to patients. Topics included RRMM symptoms and 
impacts and the mode of administration, frequency, duration, convenience, side 
effects, and overall experience with RRMM treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients completed interviews. At enrollment, 59.1% of 
participants were using regimens containing dexamethasone, 36.4% daratumumab, 
27.3% carfilzomib, and 18.2% lenalidomide. More participants had experience 
using intravenous or injectable therapy alone (40.9%) than oral therapy alone 
(18.2%). Back pain and fatigue were the most frequently reported symptoms (40.9% 
each); 27.3% reported no symptoms. Most participants reported physical function 
limitations (86.4%), emotional impacts (77.3%), MM-related activity limitations 
(72.7%), and sleep disturbances (63.6%). Most participants perceived treatment 
effectiveness based on physician-explained clinical signs (68.2%) and symptom 
relief (40.9%). Participants experienced gastrointestinal adverse events 
(59.1%), fatigue (59.1%), sleep disturbances (31.8%), and allergic reactions 
(31.8%) with treatment. Key elements of treatment burden included the duration 
of a typical treatment day (68.2%), treatment interfering with daily activities 
(54.5%), and infusion duration (50.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide treatment experience-related data to further 
understand RRMM treatment burden and better inform treatment decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
randomized clinical trial STEP-KOA (STepped Exercise Program for patients with 
Knee OsteoArthritis).
METHODS: The trial included 230 intervention and 115 control participants from 2 
Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. A decision tree simulated outcomes for 
cohorts of patients receiving arthritis education (control) or STEP-KOA 
(intervention), which consisted of an internet-based exercise training program 
(step 1), phone counseling (step 2), and physical therapy (step 3) according to 
patient's response. Intervention costs were assessed from the VA perspective. 
Quality of life (QOL) was measured using 5-level EQ-5D US utility weights. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the difference 
in costs divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
between arms at 9 months. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
used to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.
RESULTS: The adjusted model found differential improvement in QOL utility 
weights of 0.042 (95% confidence interval 0.003-0.080; P=.03) for STEP-KOA 
versus control at 9 months. In the base case, STEP-KOA resulted in an 
incremental gain of 0.028 QALYs and an incremental cost of $279 per patient for 
an ICER of $10 076. One-way sensitivity analyses found the largest sources of 
variation in the ICER were the impact on QOL and the need for a VA-owned tablet. 
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 98% probability of 
cost-effectiveness at $50 000 willingness-to-pay per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: STEP-KOA improves QOL and has a high probability of 
cost-effectiveness. Resources needed to implement the program will decline as 
ownership of mobile health devices increases.

The 10-15-years decrease in life expectancy observed in individuals with bipolar 
disorder (BD) has been linked to the concept of accelerated cellular aging. 
Telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) have been 
proposed as markers of cellular aging and comparisons between individuals with 
BD and healthy controls (HC) sometimes led to conflicting results. Previous 
studies had moderate sample sizes and studies combining these two markers into a 
single analysis are scarce. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we 
measured both TL and mtDNAcn in DNA (peripheral blood) in a sample of 130 
individuals with BD and 78 HC. Regression analyses, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), and clustering analyses were performed. We observed 
significantly lower TL and mtDNAcn in individuals with BD as compared to HC 
(respective decrease of 26.5 and 35.8%). ROC analyses showed that TL and mtDNAcn 
highly discriminated groups (AUC = 0.904 for TL and AUC = 0.931 for mtDNAcn). In 
the whole population, clustering analyses identified a group of young 
individuals (age around 36 years), with accelerated cellular aging (both shorter 
TL and lower mtDNAcn), which consisted mostly of individuals with BD (85.5%). 
The subgroup of patients with young age but accelerated aging was not 
characterized by specific clinical variables related to the course of BD or 
childhood maltreatment. However, patients in this subgroup were more frequently 
treated with anticonvulsants. Further characterization of this subgroup is 
required to better understand the molecular mechanisms and the risk factors of 
accelerated cellular aging in BD.

We constructed a cost-effectiveness model to assess the clinical and economic 
value of a CDS alert program that provides pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing 
results, compared to no alert program in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 
atrial fibrillation (AF), from a health system perspective. We defaulted that 
20% of 500,000 health-system members between the ages of 55 and 65 received PGx 
testing for CYP2C19 (ACS-clopidogrel) and CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and VKORC1 
(AF-warfarin) annually. Clinical events, costs, and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were calculated over 20 years with an annual discount rate of 3%. In 
total, 3169 alerts would be fired. The CDS alert program would help avoid 16 
major clinical events and 6 deaths for ACS; and 2 clinical events and 0.9 deaths 
for AF. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $39,477/QALY. A PGx-CDS 
alert program was cost-effective, under a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY gained, compared to no alert program.

RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: A more effective allocation of critical care 
resources is important as the cost of intensive care increases. A model has been 
developed to predict the probability of in-hospital death among patients who 
received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Cost-effectiveness analyses 
(CEA) were performed regarding the relationship between hospitalization expenses 
and predicted survival outcomes.
METHODS: Adult patients who received ECMO in a medical center in Taiwan 
(2005-2016) were included. A logistic regression model was applied to a spectrum 
of clinical measures obtained before and during ECMO institutions to identify 
the risk variables for in-hospital mortality. CEA were reported as a predictive 
risk in quintiles and defined as the cost of each quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). The distribution of the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) was measured by 
the ellipse and acceptability curve methods.
RESULTS: A total of 919 patients (659 males, mean age: 53.7 years) were 
enrolled. Ten variables emerged as significant predictors of in-hospital death. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75 (95% 
confidence interval: 0.72-0.79). In-hospital and total follow-up times were 
40,366 and 660,205 person-days, respectively. The total in-hospital expense was 
$31,818,701 USD and the total effectiveness was 1687.3 QALY. For the lowest to 
the highest risk quintile, the mean mortality risks were 0.30, 0.48, 0.61, 0.75, 
and 0.88, and mean adjusted CER were $24,230, $43,042, $54,929, $84,973, and 
$149,095 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficient allocation of limited and costly resources is most 
important when one is forced to decide between groups of critically ill 
patients. The current analyses of ECMO outcomes should assist in identifying 
candidates with the greatest prospect for survival while avoiding futile 
treatments.
