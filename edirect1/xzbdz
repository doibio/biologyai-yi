OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to present the progressive extension of 
the concept of damage control resuscitation, focusing on the prehospital phase.
ARTICLE TYPE: Review of the literature in Medline database over the past 10 
years.
DATA SOURCE: Medline database looking for articles published in English or in 
French between April 2002 and March 2013. Keywords used were: damage control 
resuscitation, trauma damage control, prehospital trauma, damage control 
surgery. Original articles were firstly selected. Editorials and reviews were 
secondly studied.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The importance of early management of life-threatening injuries 
and rapid transport to trauma centers has been widely promulgated. Technical 
progress appears for external methods of hemostasis, with the development of 
handy tourniquets and hemostatic dressings, making the crucial control of 
external bleeding more simple, rapid and effective. Hypothermia is independently 
associated with increased risk of mortality, and appeared accessible to 
improvement of prehospital care. The impact of excessive fluid resuscitation 
appears negative. The interest of hypertonic saline is denied. The place of 
vasopressor such as norepinephrine in the early resuscitation is still under 
debate. The early use of tranexamic acid is promoted. Specific transfusion 
strategies are developed in the prehospital setting.
CONCLUSION: It is critical that both civilian and military practitioners 
involved in trauma continue to share experiences and constructive feedback. And 
it is mandatory now to perform well-designed prospective clinical trials in 
order to advance the topic.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of chitosan (CH) film 
incorporated with tea polyphenol (TP) on quality and shelf life of pork meat 
patties stored at 4±1 °C for 12 days. The microbiological, physicochemical (pH, 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values, and metmyoglobin 
(MetMb)), and sensory qualities were measured on all the samples. A 
microbiological shelf-life extension of 6 days was achieved for CH and CH-TP 
treatment groups when compared to the control group. Wrapping with CH-TP 
composite film tended to retard the increases in TBARS values and MetMb content. 
CH-TP composite film maintained acceptable sensory quality of pork meat patties 
throughout the storage. The results indicated that CH-TP composite film could be 
a promising material as a packaging film for extending the shelf life of pork 
meat patties.

Stepping down from high dose fluticasone/salmeterol to extrafine BDP/F in asthma 
is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: GINA guideline recommends stepping down treatment of asthma patients 
where control is achieved. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the costs 
and health outcomes associated with step down of controlled patients on high 
dose fluticasone/salmeterol (FP/S 1000/100 μg daily) to either medium dose FP/S 
(500/100 μg) dry powder or extrafine beclometasone/formoterol (BDP/F 400/24 μg) 
pMDI in three European countries.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation Markov model was constructed to enable the 
simulation of three comparative arms (FP/S 1000/100, FP/S 500/100, BDP/F 
400/24). Transition probabilities and healthcare resources consumption were 
derived from a multinational clinical trial comparing BDP/F 400/24 μg vs. FP/S 
500/100 μg as step down therapy in asthma. Direct costs and health state 
utilities were sourced from public source and published literature. The analysis 
was conducted from a health system perspective, based on six months horizon. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) associated with high 
dose dry powder FP/S 1000/100 μg vs. extrafine BDP/F 400/24 μg was above 
70,000 GBP and 200,000 €/QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years). An ICER of 
29,000 GBP/QALY and above 30,000 €/QALY was associated with medium dose dry 
powder FP/S 500/100 μg vs. BDP/F 400/24 μg.
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that maintaining controlled patients on high dose FP/S 
is not cost-effective. Extrafine BDP/F 400/24 μg daily can be considered to be a 
cost-effective option in the countries analyzed to maintain control of asthmatic 
patients stepped down from high dose FP/S 1000/100 μg daily dry powder or 
suspension formulations.

BACKGROUND: Questions have been raised about the costs and outcomes for patients 
receiving on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. As part of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) multisite 
trial, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare on-pump versus 
off-pump patients' quality-adjusted life-years and costs at 1 year.
METHODS: One-year outcomes and costs (standardized to 2010 dollars) were 
estimated in multivariate regression models, controlling for site and baseline 
patient factors. The 1-year incremental cost-effectiveness analysis ratio with 
95% confidence intervals was calculated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Eighteen centers randomly assigned 2,203 participants to on-pump 
(n=1,099) versus off-pump (n=1,104) coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Both 
groups' quality of life improved significantly after surgery (p<0.01) compared 
with baseline, but no differences were found between treatment groups. Adjusted 
cost of the index coronary artery bypass graft surgery hospitalization was 
$36,046 on-pump and $36,536 off-pump (p=0.16). At 1 year, on-pump adjusted cost 
was $56,023 versus $59,623 off-pump (p=0.046). Off-pump-to-on-pump conversions 
after first distal anastomosis (4.8%) had significantly higher 1-year costs. 
Excluding conversions, there were no significant differences between treatments 
for index hospitalization or 1-year total costs.
CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery was more 
expensive than on-pump when late off-pump-to-on-pump conversions were included. 
Excluding late conversions, there was no difference in quality-adjusted 
life-years or costs.

Cross-national disparities in sex differences in life expectancy with and 
without frailty.

Romero-Ortuno R(1), Fouweather T, Jagger C.

Author information:

Dublin, Ireland.

BACKGROUND: with continued ageing, levels of frailty are an increasing concern. 
Women live longer than men, but how life expectancies (LE) with frailty differ 
between men and women and whether sex differences are the same for all European 
countries is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: to compare sex differences in LE in phenotypic frailty categories and 
disability at age ≥50 between European countries.
DESIGN: the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).
SUBJECTS: a total of 50,351 people aged ≥50 from SHARE wave 4 (included 
countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, 
Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden).
METHODS: the SHARE Frailty Instrument for Primary Care and the Global Activity 
Limitation Indicator were combined to define four phenotypic frailty and 
disability categories: robust, pre-frail, frail and severely limited. LEs with 
each state by sex and country were calculated using Sullivan's method.
RESULTS: at age 70, the LE robust ranged from 4.1 to 10.4 years (men) and 3.0 to 
8.9 years (women), LE pre-frail from 0.8-3.1 years (men) and 2.2-5.5 years 
(women), LE frail from 0.1-1.8 years (men) and 0.4-5.5 years (women) and LE with 
severe activity limitation from 1.9 to 4.4 years (men) and 2.9 to 7.5 years 
(women). At all ages and both sexes the fewest years were spent frail.
CONCLUSIONS: this study is the first to compare differences in LE in frailty 
categories across European countries. In most European countries, years spent 
robust (free of frailty or limitation) are significantly less for women than 
men, perhaps due to socio-economic as well as biological factors.

cirrhosis: a Markov decision analysis model.

USA.

Many transplant centers require that patients maintain a BMI below 40 kg/m(2) in 
order to be eligible for listing, rendering many morbidly obese patients with 
end-stage liver disease unable to access liver transplantation as a method of 
treatment. In order to determine the safest and most efficacious weight loss 
regimen in this challenging population, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 
adjustable gastric banding (AGB), and diet and exercise were modeled to assess 
their impact on life expectancy in morbidly obese patients with cirrhosis. A 
Markov state transition model was developed to assess the survival benefit of 
undergoing RYGB, AGB, or 1 year of diet and exercise in morbidly obese patients 
with compensated cirrhosis. A base case analysis of no weight loss intervention 
in a 45-year-old patient with compensated cirrhosis and a BMI of 45 kg/m(2) 
revealed an average survival of 7.93 years. The average survival for the weight 
loss simulations was 9.14, 8.84, and 8.16 years for RYGB, AGB, and diet and 
exercise, respectively. In morbidly obese patients with compensated cirrhosis, 
RYGB allows patients to lose more weight more rapidly than is probable with 
either AGB or diet and exercise, thus having the greatest impact on survival.

recipients: development and validation of a clinical risk score.

AIMS: To reduce sudden cardiac death, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators 
(ICDs) are indicated in patients with ischaemic and non-ischaemic dilated 
cardiomyopathy and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%. Current 
guidelines do not recommend device therapy in patients with a life expectancy <1 
year since benefit in these patients is low. In this study, we evaluated the 
incidence and predictors of early mortality (<1 year after implantation) in a 
consecutive primary prevention population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis was performed on a prediction and validation 
cohort. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year. The prediction 
cohort comprised 861 prophylactic ICD recipients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy 
or dilated cardiomyopathy from the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam) and 
Thorax Center Twente (Enschede). Detailed clinical data were collected. After 
multivariate analysis, a risk score was developed based on age ≥75 years, LVEF ≤ 
20%, history of atrial fibrillation, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Using these predictors, a low (≤1 factor), 
intermediate (2 factors), and high (≥3 factors) risk group could be identified 
with 1-year mortality of, respectively, 3.4, 10.9, and 38.9% (P< 0.01). 
Afterwards, the risk score was validated in 706 primary prevention patients from 
the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam). One-year mortality was, respectively, 
2.5, 13.2, and 46.3% (all P< 0.01).
CONCLUSION: A simple risk score based on age, LVEF, eGFR, and atrial 
fibrillation can identify patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for early 
mortality after ICD implantation. This may be helpful in the risk assessment of 
ICD candidates.

and Nanotechnology, Hannam University, Daejeon, South Korea.

Neurite growth requires neurite extension and retraction, which are associated 
with protein degradation. Autophagy is a conserved bulk degradation pathway that 
regulates several cellular processes. However, little is known about autophagic 
regulation during early neurite growth. In this study, we investigated whether 
autophagy was involved in early neurite growth and how it regulated neurite 
growth in primary cortical neurons. Components of autophagy were expressed and 
autophagy was activated during early neurite growth. Interestingly, inhibition 
of autophagy by atg7 small interfering RNA (siRNA) caused elongation of axons, 
while activation of autophagy by rapamycin suppressed axon growth. Surprisingly, 
inhibition of autophagy reduced the protein level of RhoA. Moreover, expression 
of RhoA suppressed axon overelongation mediated by autophagy inhibition, whereas 
inhibition of the RhoA signaling pathway by Y-27632 recovered rapamycin-mediated 
suppression of axon growth. Interestingly, hnRNP-Q1, which negatively regulates 
RhoA, accumulated in autophagy-deficient neurons, while its protein level was 
reduced by autophagy activation. Overall, our study suggests that autophagy 
negatively regulates axon extension via the RhoA-ROCK pathway by regulating 
hnRNP-Q1 in primary cortical neurons. Therefore, autophagy might serve as a 
fine-tuning mechanism to regulate early axon extension.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating illness that affects quality of life 
and life expectancy for patients. In Cameroon, it is now possible to opt for 
termination of an affected pregnancy (TAP) where the fetus is found to be 
affected by SCD. Our earlier studies found that, contrary to the views of 
Cameroonian physicians, a majority of parents with their children suffering from 
SCD would choose to abort if the fetuses were found to be affected. What have 
not yet been investigated are the views of people suffering from/living with 
SCD. We used a quantitative sociological method, with administered structured 
questionnaires, to study the attitudes of adult patients suffering from SCD on 
prenatal genetic diagnosis (PND) and possible TAP. The majority of the 89 
participants were urban dwellers (84.3%), women (57.3%), Christian (95.5%) and 
single (90.9%), with a secondary/tertiary education (79.5%). The majority 
(89.2%) would consider PND for SCD; almost half (48.5%) would reject TAP while 
40.9% would consider it. Respondents who rejected TAP claimed mostly ethical 
reasons (78.1%) while those who found TAP acceptable cited fear of having an 
affected child (88.9%) and the poor quality of the affected child's health 
(81.5%). Cameroonian patients with SCD are generally supportive of PND and a 
remarkably high number of patients living with SCD reported that they would 
consider terminating a pregnancy based on their assessment of the future 
well-being of the child. Research is required to investigate the burden of SCD 
on families and their quality of life.

BACKGROUND: This article of the International Epidemiological Association 
commissioned paper series stocktakes the population health and status of 
epidemiology in 21 of the 53 countries of the WHO European Region. By United 
Nations geographical classification, these countries belong to Eastern Europe, 
Western Asia and South-Central Asia.
METHODS: Published data were used to describe population health indicators and 
risk factors. Epidemiological training and research was assessed based on author 
knowledge, information searches and E-mail survey of experts. Bibliometric 
analyses determined epidemiological publication outputs.
RESULTS: Between-country differences in life expectancy, amount and profile of 
disease burden and prevalence of risk factors are marked. Epidemiological 
training is affected by ongoing structural reforms of educational systems. 
Training is advanced in Israel and several Eastern European countries. 
Epidemiological research is mainly university-based in most countries, but 
predominantly conducted by governmental research institutes in several countries 
of the former Soviet Union. Funding is generally external and limited, partially 
due to competition from and prioritization of biomedical research. Multiple 
relevant professional societies exist, especially in Poland, the Czech Republic 
and Hungary. Few of the region's 39 epidemiological academic journals have 
international currency. The number of epidemiological publications per 
population is highest for Israel and lowest for South-Central Asian countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological capacity will continue to be heterogeneous across 
the region and depend more on countries' individual historical, social, 
political and economic conditions and contexts than their epidemiologists' 
successive efforts. National and international research funding, and within- and 
between-country collaborations should be enhanced, especially for South-Central 
Asian countries.

OBJECTIVES: Clinical evidence indicates newborn critical congenital heart 
disease (CCHD) screening through pulse oximetry is lifesaving. In 2011, CCHD was 
added to the US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel for newborns. Several states 
have implemented or are considering screening mandates. This study aimed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine screening among US newborns 
unsuspected of having CCHD.
METHODS: We developed a cohort model with a time horizon of infancy to estimate 
the inpatient medical costs and health benefits of CCHD screening. Model inputs 
were derived from new estimates of hospital screening costs and inpatient care 
for infants with late-detected CCHD, defined as no diagnosis at the birth 
hospital. We estimated the number of newborns with CCHD detected at birth 
hospitals and life-years saved with routine screening compared with no 
screening.
RESULTS: Screening was estimated to incur an additional cost of $6.28 per 
newborn, with incremental costs of $20 862 per newborn with CCHD detected at 
birth hospitals and $40 385 per life-year gained (2011 US dollars). We estimated 
1189 more newborns with CCHD would be identified at birth hospitals and 20 
infant deaths averted annually with screening. Another 1975 false-positive 
results not associated with CCHD were estimated to occur, although these results 
had a minimal impact on total estimated costs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first US cost-effectiveness analysis of 
CCHD screening in the United States could be reasonably cost-effective. We 
anticipate data from states that have recently approved or initiated CCHD 
screening will become available over the next few years to refine these 
projections.

Lymphomas or hepatocarcinomas related to blood-borne transmitted diseases are 
well-known malignancies in persons with haemophilia (PWH). However, rising life 
expectancy has increased the number of PWH suffering from other malignancies. 
This study aimed to collect cancer occurrence data in PWH followed in five 
European haemophilia treatment centres (Brussels, Geneva, Marseille, Montpellier 
and Paris-Bicêtre) over the last 10 years and to analyse some particular 
features of cancer occurring in PWH. In total, 45 malignancies were diagnosed in 
1067 PWH. The most common malignancies were hepatocellular carcinoma (12/45) and 
urogenital tract tumours (9/45). Bleeding at presentation or changes in bleeding 
pattern was indicative of cancer in four patients. Three patients with mild 
haemophilia developed anti-factor VIII inhibitors after intensive substitution 
therapy prior to surgery or invasive procedures. There was no bleeding 
associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A few bleeding complications 
occurred following invasive (3/39) or surgical procedures (2/27) as a result of 
insufficient hemostatic coverage or in spite of adequate substitution. No 
bleeding was noted after liver or prostate biopsies. Following cancer diagnosis, 
five patients were switched from on-demand to prolonged prophylaxis 
substitution. In the majority of cases, the standard cancer treatment protocol 
was not modified on account of concomitant haemophilia. Thus, oncological 
treatments are not contraindicated and should not be withheld in PWH assuming 
that adequate haemostasis correction is undertaken. As shown by our study 
results, a change in bleeding pattern in adult PWH should raise suspicion of a 
malignancy. Intensive substitution must be considered a risk factor for 
inhibitor development.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of universal vaccination with a pentavalent 
rotavirus vaccine (RV5) on the healthcare burden and costs associated with 
rotavirus gastroenteritis (RGE) in Japan.
METHODS: The model included a hypothetical cohort of 1,091,156 children followed 
for their first 5 years of life. In the absence of universal vaccination, there 
were 19 deaths, 78,000 hospitalizations, and 678,000 outpatient visits due to 
RGE. The efficacy of RV5 is based on international clinical trial data, which 
was similar to the efficacy observed in clinical trials conducted in Japan. The 
primary outcome measure is the cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) 
gained. In the base case, the QALY loss per 1000 RGE episodes included 2.2 for 
children and 1.8 per parent.
RESULTS: Universal vaccination is projected to reduce hospitalizations by 92%, 
outpatient visits by 74%, and work-loss days by 73%. For the base case analysis, 
the total vaccination cost was ¥26 billion. The estimated reduction in medical 
costs was ¥16 billion. Of 2500 QALYs gained with the vaccination program, 
approximately half are directly attributed to the child. In the base case 
analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vaccination vs. no 
vaccination is ¥4 million and ¥2 million per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained from the healthcare payer and societal perspectives, respectively. The 
ICERs are ¥8 million and ¥4 million if parental disutilities are excluded. KEY 
LIMITATION: The QALY decrements for children and parents were evaluated using 
different instruments, and the QALY decrements do not vary based on episode 
severity. Given the interdependence between children and their parents, 
excluding parental disutilities may under-estimate the impact of RGE.
CONCLUSION: Universal vaccination with RV5 in Japan is projected to have a 
substantial public health impact and may be cost-effective from both the payer 
and societal perspectives if parental disutilities are included in the 
cost-effectiveness ratios.

BACKGROUND: The serious consequences of diabetes mellitus, and the subsequent 
economic burden, call for urgent preventative action in developing countries. 
This study explores the clinical and economic outcomes of strategies that could 
potentially prevent diabetes based on Chinese circumstances. It aims to provide 
indicators for the long-term allocation of healthcare resources for authorities 
in developing countries.
METHODS: A representative sample of Chinese adults was used to create a 
simulated population of 20,000 people aged 25 years and above. The hybrid 
decision tree Markov model was developed to compare the long-term clinical and 
economic outcomes of four simulated diabetes prevention strategies with a 
control group, where no prevention applied. These preventive strategies were the 
following: (i) one-off screening for undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose 
tolerance (IGT), with lifestyle interventions on diet, (ii) on exercise, (iii) 
on diet combined exercise (duo-intervention) respectively in those with IGT, and 
(iv) one-off screening alone. Independent age-specific models were simulated 
based on diverse incidences of diabetes, mortalities and health utilities. The 
reported outcomes were the following: the remaining survival years, the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per diabetes or IGT subjects, societal costs 
per simulated subject and the comparisons between preventions and control over 
40 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on variations of all 
assumptions, in addition to the performance and the compliance of screening.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, all simulated screening programmes 
prolonged life expectancy at the initiation ages of 25 and 40 years, postponed 
the onset of diabetes and increased QALYs at every initiation age. Along with an 
assumption of six years intervention, prevention programmes were associated with 
cost-saving compared with the control group, especially in the population aged 
25 years. The savings were at least US$2017 per subject, but no statistically 
significant difference was observed among the intervention strategies within 
each age groups. The cost savings were reduced when screening was affected by 
poor performance and noncompliance.
CONCLUSIONS: Developing countries have few effective strategies to manage the 
prevention of diabetes. One-off screening for undiagnosed diabetes and IGT, with 
appropriate lifestyle interventions for those with IGT are cost saving in China, 
especially in young adults.

BACKGROUND: Priority setting, identification of unmet and changing healthcare 
needs, service and policy planning, and the capacity to evaluate the impact of 
health interventions requires valid and reliable methods for quantifying disease 
and injury burden. The methodology developed for the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) studies has been adopted to estimate the burden of disease in national, 
regional and global projects. However, there has been little validation of the 
methods for estimating injury burden using empirical data.
OBJECTIVE: To provide valid estimates of the burden of non-fatal injury using 
empirical data.
SETTING: Data from prospective cohort studies of injury outcomes undertaken in 
the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Meta-analysis of deidentified, patient-level data from 
over 40 000 injured participants in six prospective cohort studies: Victorian 
State Trauma Registry, Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry, UK Burden 
of Injury study, Prospective Outcomes of Injury study, National Study on Costs 
and Outcomes of Trauma and the Dutch Injury Patient Survey.
ANALYSIS: Data will be systematically analysed to evaluate and refine injury 
classification, development of disability weights, establishing the duration of 
disability and handling of cases with more than one injury in burden estimates. 
Developed methods will be applied to incidence data to compare and contrast 
various methods for estimating non-fatal injury burden.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD: The findings of this international collaboration have 
the capacity to drive how injury burden is measured for future GBD estimates and 
for individual country or region-specific studies.

Life expectancy and national income in Europe, 1900-2008: an update of Preston's 
analysis.

Mackenbach JP(1), Looman CW.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: In the past, upward shifts of the so-called Preston curve, which 
relates life expectancy to national income, have contributed importantly to 
worldwide increases in life expectancy. These shifts were due to rapid diffusion 
of knowledge and technology for infectious disease control from high-income to 
low-income countries. We assessed to what extent life expectancy growth in 
Europe has been accompanied by upward shifts in the relation between national 
income and life expectancy in later parts of the 20th century, when progress in 
cardiovascular disease control was the main driver of life expectancy growth.
METHODS: Data on national income (gross domestic product per capita, in 1990 
international dollars), life expectancy and cause-specific mortality covering 
the period 1900-2008 were extracted from international data banks. (Change in) 
life expectancy and age-standardized mortality was regressed on (change in) 
national income, and the regression parameters were used to estimate the 
contribution to rising life expectancy and declining mortality in Europe as a 
whole of changes in national income vs shifts in the relation between national 
income and health outcomes.
RESULTS: Large upward shifts in the relation between national income and life 
expectancy only occurred before 1960, and were due to rapid declines in 
mortality from infectious diseases which were independent of rises in national 
income. These shifts account for between two-thirds and four-fifths of the 
increase in life expectancy in Europe as a whole during this period. After 1960, 
upward shifts in the relation between national income and life expectancy were 
much smaller, and contributed only between one-quarter and one-half to the 
increase in life expectancy in Europe as a whole. During the latter period, 
declines in mortality from cardiovascular disease were mainly attributable to 
increases in national income.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to earlier periods, recent life expectancy growth in 
European countries appears to have been dependent on their economic growth. More 
rapid diffusion of knowledge and technology for cardiovascular disease control 
from higher- to lower-income countries in Europe may be needed to close the 
East-West life expectancy gap, but it is unlikely that this can be achieved in 
the absence of more equal economic conditions.

Design of schistosomiasis ontology (IDOSCHISTO) extending the infectious disease 
ontology.

Camara G(1), Despres S, Djedidi R, Lo M.

Author information:

Epidemiological monitoring of the schistosomiasis' spreading brings together 
many practitioners working at different levels of granularity (biology, host 
individual, host population), who have different perspectives (biology, clinic 
and epidemiology) on the same phenomenon. Biological perspective deals with 
pathogens (e.g. life cycle) or physiopathology while clinical perspective deals 
with hosts (e.g. healthy or infected host, diagnosis, treatment, etc.). In an 
epidemiological perspective corresponding to the host population level of 
granularity, the schistosomiasis disease is characterized according to the way 
(causes, risk factors, etc.) it spreads in this population over space and time. 
In this paper we provide an ontological analysis and design for the 
Schistosomiasis domain knowledge and spreading dynamics. IDOSCHISTO - the 
schistosomiasis ontology - is designed as an extension of the Infectious Disease 
Ontology (IDO). This ontology aims at supporting the schistosomiasis monitoring 
process during a spreading crisis by enabling data integration, semantic 
interoperability, for collaborative work on one hand and for risk analysis and 
decision making on the other hand.

Biomedical Sciences, Japan.

The Nagasaki University Atomic Bomb Survivor Database, which was established in 
1978 for elucidating the long-term health effects of the atomic bombing, has 
registered since 1970 about 120,000 atomic bomb survivors with a history of 
residence in Nagasaki city. Since the number of atomic bomb survivors has 
steadily been decreasing, prediction of future population is important for 
planning future epidemiologic studies, and we tried to predict the population of 
atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki city from 2008 to 2030. In addition, we 
evaluated our estimated population comparing with the actual number from 2008 to 
2011.

Effect of facet joint injection versus systemic steroids in low back pain: a 
randomized controlled trial.

Ribeiro LH(1), Furtado RN, Konai MS, Andreo AB, Rosenfeld A, Natour J.

Author information:
(1)From the Division of Rheumatology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo 
(UNIFESP), São Paulo, Brazil.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of facet joint injection versus systemic 
steroid in patients with a diagnosis of facet joint syndrome.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The term facet joint syndrome has been used to 
define back pain originating from the facet joints. Treatment is mainly 
conservative, although interventions, including intra-articular injections and 
medial branch nerve blocks are used to manage facet-mediated pain. Several 
studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions. Results of 
facet joint injection, however, are conflicting.
METHODS: Sixty subjects with a diagnosis of facet joint syndrome were enrolled 
in the study. They were randomized into experimental and control groups. The 
experimental group was administered with intra-articular injection of 6 lumbar 
facet joints with triamcinolone hexacetonide; the control group was administered 
with triamcinolone acetonide intramuscular injection of 6 lumbar paravertebral 
points. Visits were taken at baseline and at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after 
interventions. Outcome measures were used: pain visual analogue scale, pain 
visual analogue scale during extension of the spine, Likert scale, improvement 
percentage scale, Roland-Morris, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and 
accountability of medications taken.Homogeneity was tested using the Student t, 
Pearson χ, and Mann-Whitney tests. Analysis of variance was used to analyze 
differences in the groups over time and the Student t test to analyze 
differences between groups at each time evaluation.
RESULTS: The groups were similar at baseline. Comparisons between the groups 
showed, in analysis of variance analysis, an improvement in the experimental 
group regarding diclofenac intake and quality of life, in the "role physical" 
profile, assessed by 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.In the analysis at each 
time point, an improvement in the experimental group was also found in the 
Roland-Morris questionnaire, in the improvement percentage scale and in the 
response to treatment, assessed by the Likert scale.
CONCLUSION: Both treatments were effective, with a slight superiority of the 
intra-articular injection of steroids over intramuscular injection.

BACKGROUND: Data on the cost-effectiveness of the behavioral treatment of 
obesity are not conclusive. The cost-effectiveness of treatment in primary care 
settings is particularly relevant.
METHODS: We conducted a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis of a primary 
care-based obesity intervention. Study participants were randomized to: Usual 
Care (UC; quarterly visits with their primary care provider); Brief Lifestyle 
Counseling (BLC; quarterly provider visits plus monthly weight loss counseling 
visits) or Enhanced Brief Lifestyle Counseling (EBLC; all above interventions, 
plus choice of meal replacements or weight loss medication). A health-care payer 
perspective was used. Intervention costs were estimated from tracking data 
obtained prospectively. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated with 
the EuroQol-5D. We estimated cost per kilogram-year of weight loss and cost per 
QALY.
RESULTS: Weight losses after 2 years were 1.7, 2.9 and 4.6 kg for UC, BLC and 
EBLC, respectively (P=0.003 for comparison of EBLC vs UC). The incremental cost 
per kilogram-year lost was $292 for EBLC compared with UC (95% confidence 
interval (CI): $219-$437). The short-term incremental cost per QALY was 
$115,397, but the 95% CI were undefined. Comparison of short-term cost per kg 
with published estimates of longer-term cost per QALY suggested that the 
intervention could be cost-effective over the long term (≥ 10 years).
CONCLUSIONS: A primary care intervention that includes monthly counseling visits 
and a choice of meal replacements or weight loss medication could be a 
cost-effective treatment for obesity over the long term. However, additional 
studies are needed on the cost-effectiveness of behavioral treatment of obesity.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2013 Aug 6;159(3):I-15.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes 
recommendations for 60 distinct clinical services, but clinicians rarely have 
time to fully evaluate and implement the recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To complete a proof of concept for prioritization and personalization 
of USPSTF recommendations, using patient-specific clinical characteristics.
DESIGN: Mathematical model.
DATA SOURCES: USPSTF recommendations and supporting evidence and National Vital 
Statistics Reports.
TARGET POPULATION: Nonpregnant adults.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Individual.
INTERVENTION: USPSTF grade A and B recommendations.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Personalized gain in life expectancy associated each 
recommendation.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Increases in life expectancy varied more than 
100-fold across USPSTF recommendations, and the rank order of benefits varied 
considerably among patients. For an obese man aged 62 years who smoked and had 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and a family history of colorectal cancer, 
the model’s top 3 recommendations (from most to least gain in life expectancy) 
were tobacco cessation (adding 2.8 life-years), weight loss (adding 1.6 
life-years), and blood pressure control (adding 0.8 life-year). Lower-ranked 
recommendations were a healthier diet, aspirin use, cholesterol reduction, 
colonoscopy, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and HIV testing (each 
adding 0.1 to 0.3 life-years). For a person with the same characteristics plus 
uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, the model’s top 3 recommendations were 
diabetes control, tobacco cessation, and weight loss (each adding 1.4 to 1.8 
life-years).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Robust to variation of model inputs and 
satisfied face validity criteria.
LIMITATION: Expected adherence rates and quality of life were not considered.
CONCLUSION: Models of personalized preventive care may illustrate how magnitude 
and rank order of benefit associated with preventive guidelines vary across 
recommendations and patients. These predictions may help clinicians to 
prioritize USPSTF recommendations at the patient level.

Variation in stochastic demography between and within central and peripheral 
regions in a widespread short-lived herb.

Analyzing intraspecific variation in population dynamics in relation to 
environmental factors is crucial to understand the current and future 
distributions of plant species. Across ranges, peripheral populations are often 
expected to show lower and more temporally variable vital rates than central 
populations, although it remains unclear how much any differences in vital rates 
actually contribute to differences in population growth rates. Moreover, few 
demographic studies accounting for environmental stochasticity have been carried 
out both at continental and regional scales. In this study we calculated 
stochastic growth rates in five central and six northern peripheral populations 
of the widespread shortlived herb Plantago coronopus along the Atlantic Coast in 
Europe. To evaluate at two spatial scales how mean values and variability of 
vital rates (i.e., fecundity, recruitment, survival, growth, and shrinkage) 
contributed to the differences in stochastic growth rates, we performed 
Stochastic Life Table Response Experiment (SLTRE) analyses between and within 
central and peripheral regions. Additionally, we searched for correlations 
between vital rate contributions and local environmental conditions. Lower mean 
values and greater variability for some vital rates in peripheral than in 
central populations had an overall negative but nonsignificant effect on the 
stochastic growth rates in the periphery. Different life cycle components 
accounted for differences in population growth depending on spatial scale, 
although recruitment was the vital rate with the highest influence both between 
and within regions. Interestingly, the same pattern of differentiation among 
populations was found within central and peripheral areas: in both regions, one 
group of populations displayed positive contributions of growth and shrinkage 
and negative contributions of recruitment and survival; the opposite pattern was 
found in the remaining populations. These differences in vital rate 
contributions among populations within regions were correlated with 
precipitation regime, whereas at the continental scale, differences in 
contribution patterns were related to temperature. Altogether, our results show 
how populations of P. coronopus exhibit life cycle differences that may enable 
the species to persist in locations with widely varying environmental 
conditions. This demographic flexibility may help to explain the success of 
widespread plants across large and heterogeneous ranges.

DNA microarray technology offers potential for future high-throughput variation 
genotyping. Allele-specific primer extension procedure on microarray has been 
considered as an efficient method for single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) 
genotyping. However, the high cost of the fluorescent-labeled dNTP used for 
signal detection in this method limits its application. In the present study, we 
evaluated the characteristics of solid-phase allele-specific primer extension, 
in terms of specificity and efficiency and demonstrated that compared to 
liquid-phase reaction, it requires lower annealing temperature, and higher
