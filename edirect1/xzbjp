OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the current literature detailing the 
cost-effectiveness of the herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine, and to provide Canadian 
policy-makers with cost-effectiveness measurements in a Canadian context.
METHODS: This article builds on an existing systematic review of the HZ vaccine 
that offers a quality assessment of 11 recent articles. We first replicated this 
study, and then two assessors reviewed the articles and extracted information on 
vaccine effectiveness, cost of HZ, other modelling assumptions and QALY 
estimates. Then we transformed the results into a format useful for Canadian 
policy decisions. Results expressed in different currencies from different years 
were converted into 2012 Canadian dollars using Bank of Canada exchange rates 
and a Consumer Price Index deflator. Modelling assumptions that varied between 
studies were synthesized. We tabled the results for comparability.
SYNTHESIS: The Szucs systematic review presented a thorough methodological 
assessment of the relevant literature. However, the various studies presented 
results in a variety of currencies, and based their analyses on disparate 
methodological assumptions. Most of the current literature uses Markov chain 
models to estimate HZ prevalence. Cost assumptions, discount rate assumptions, 
assumptions about vaccine efficacy and waning and epidemiological assumptions 
drove variation in the outcomes. This article transforms the results into a 
table easily understood by policy-makers.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the current literature shows that HZ vaccination is 
cost-effective at the price of $100,000 per QALY. Few studies showed that 
vaccination cost-effectiveness was higher than this threshold, and only under 
conservative assumptions. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to vaccine price and 
discount rate.

OBJECTIFS: Faire une synthèse de la littérature actuelle sur le rapport 
coût-efficacité du vaccin contre le virus de l’herpès zoster (zona) et fournir 
aux responsables des politiques du Canada des indicateurs coûtefficacité dans un 
contexte canadien. MÉTHODE : Cet article fait fond sur une revue systématique 
existante qui évalue la qualité de 11 articles récents portant sur le vaccin 
contre le zona. Nous avons d’abord reproduit l’étude, après quoi deux 
évaluateurs ont examiné les articles et en ont extrait l’information sur 
l’efficacité du vaccin, le coût du zona, les autres postulats de modélisation et 
les estimations des années de vie pondérées par la qualité (AVPQ). Ensuite, nous 
avons transposé les résultats sous une forme utile aux décisions stratégiques 
canadiennes. Les résultats, exprimés en différentes devises pour différentes 
années, ont été convertis en dollars canadiens de 2012 à l’aide des taux de 
change de la Banque du Canada et d’un déflateur: l’indice des prix à la 
consommation. Les postulats de modélisation variables d’une étude à l’autre ont 
été synthétisés. Nous avons mis les résultats en tableaux pour pouvoir les 
comparer. SYNTHÈSE : La revue systématique de Szucs présentait une évaluation 
méthodologique exhaustive de la littérature pertinente. Cependant, les résultats 
des diverses études étaient présentés dans toutes sortes de devises, et les 
analyses étaient fondées sur des postulats méthodologiques disparates. La 
plupart des articles récents font appel aux modèles en chaînes de Markov pour 
estimer la prévalence du zona. Les postulats relatifs aux coûts, aux taux 
d’actualisation, à l’efficacité potentielle du vaccin, à la baisse de l’immunité 
conférée par le vaccin, ainsi que les postulats épidémiologiques, ont fait 
varier les résultats. Notre article transpose ces résultats dans un tableau 
facile à comprendre pour les responsables des politiques. CONCLUSION : Selon la 
majorité des articles récents, la vaccination contre le zona est rentable au 
prix de 100 000 $ par AVPQ. Peu d’études indiquent un rapport coût-efficacité de 
la vaccination supérieur à ce seuil, et seulement sur la base de postulats 
prudents. Le rapport coût-efficacité était sensible au prix et au taux 
d’actualisation du vaccin.

Life tables and survival curves of tadpoles from Rhinella icterica species were 
studied in the laboratory, under abiotic conditions controlled by a purification 
filter, a timer and a chiller. The survival curve for larval stage confirms a 
great mortality trend in the initial stages, which decreases when reaching the 
mature morphological condition (r = -0.94). Stages 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 showed 
gradual values for their age structures, while stages 42, 43 and 44 presented 
high variations. Based on the results under laboratory conditions, it can be 
concluded that the maturity of R. icterica tadpoles development between 37 and 
44 stages has a negative correlation and their predicted life expectancy is a 
logarithmic growth curve (y=-761.96Ln(x)+5298.5).

INTRODUCTION: Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous, pre-malignant 
disease accounting for 15-20% of all new breast cancers. If appropriately 
managed, DCIS has a small chance of impacting on patient life expectancy. 
Despite the possibility of a further recurrence or of a development in an 
invasive form, we are unable to select treatment of choice especially in the 
elderly. In particularly we risk an overtreatment of women at low risk of 
progression to invasive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to 
retrospectively evaluate the outcome of elderly patients affected by DCIS not 
undergoing Radiation Therapy (RT) after Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively-maintained database from 
1998 to 2013, selecting all women over 65 years old diagnosed with DCIS who did 
not receive RT for personal choice. We considered two groups, according to the 
risk of local recurrence (Low Risk (Group 1) vs. High Risk (Group 2)).
RESULTS: We identified 44 cases of DCIS treated with surgery alone or with 
surgery followed by adjuvant tamoxifen. 24 patients presented low risk of local 
recurrence (Group 1) and 20 had characteristics associated to high risk of local 
recurrence (Group 2). At a median follow-up of 66.3 months, no local recurrences 
have been described in group 1. No patients presented distant metastases, while 
4 patients died for other causes. At a median follow-up of 72 months we observed 
5 local recurrences in the second group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that radiation therapy can be safely avoided in 
a selected group of elderly patients affected by DCIS.

OBJECTIVE: The most recent literature has shown extensively that a low-protein 
diet in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) delays the natural 
progression of end-stage renal disease and the necessary treatment of chronic 
dialysis. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a very 
low-protein diet compared with a moderate low-protein diet.
DESIGN: Markov model.
SETTING: The study was conducted from the perspective of the Italian National 
Health Service.
SUBJECTS: Patients with CKD stages 4 and 5. Seven hundred and two patients were 
considered, and half were treated with a very low-protein diet and the other 
half with a moderate low-protein diet.
INTERVENTION: The Markov model estimates the costs and the quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) associated with a very low-protein diet versus a moderate 
low-protein diet for patients with CKD Stages 4 and 5. The transition 
probability was estimated on data from 7 studies, which determined the efficacy 
of very low-protein diets in delaying the need to start maintenance dialysis. 
Utilities and cost were estimated from literature review and projected for the 
lifespan considered in the model. The annual cost of dialysis per patient was 
approximately €34,072. The cost of a very low-protein diet was €1,440 per 
patient per year in the Lazio region (conservative assumptions). Probabilistic 
and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: QALY, cost of treatment, incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio.
RESULTS: The model estimates that a very low-protein diet should be more 
effective. Dietary treatment improved 0.09 QALYs after 2 years, 0.16 after 
3 years, 0.36 after 5 years, and up to 0.93 incremental QALYs after the first 
10 years. After 2 years, the model estimated increment cost in favor of the most 
restrictive dietary treatment of €826, €2,146, €5,203, and €10,375 for 2, 3, 5, 
and 10 years of follow-up respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these simulations indicate that the treatment of CKD 
patients with a very low-protein diet is cost-effective relative to a moderate 
low-protein diet in an Italian setting. Further studies should test this model 
in other countries with different dialysis costs and dietary support.

Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, 68198, NE, USA.

Although Hispanic men are at higher risk of developing colon cancer compared to 
non-Hispanic white men, colonoscopy screening among Hispanic men is much lower 
than among non-Hispanic white men. University Health System (UHS) in San 
Antonio, Texas, instituted a Colorectal Cancer Male Navigation (CCMN) Program in 
2011 specifically designed for Hispanic men. The CCMN Program contacted 461 
Hispanic men 50 years of age and older to participate over a 2-year period. Of 
these age-eligible men, 370 were screened for CRC after being contacted by the 
navigator. Using participant and program data, a Markov model was constructed to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of the CCMN Program. An average 50-year-old 
Hispanic male who participates in the CCMN Program will have 0.3 more 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared to a similar male receiving usual 
care. Life expectancy is also predicted to increase by 6 months for participants 
compared to non-participants. The program results in net health care savings of 
$1,148 per participant ($424,760 for the 370 CCMN Program participants). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at $3,765 per QALY in favor of 
the navigation program. Interventions to reduce disparities in CRC screening 
across ethnic groups are needed, and this is one of the first studies to 
evaluate the economic benefit of a patient navigator program specifically 
designed for an urban population of Hispanic men. A colorectal cancer screening 
intervention which relies on patient navigators trained to address the unique 
needs of the targeted population (language barriers, transportation and 
scheduling assistance, colon cancer, and screening knowledge) can substantially 
increase the likelihood of screening and improve quality of life in a 
cost-effective manner.

BACKGROUND: Delirium is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality 
rates in elderly hospitalised patients, and a growing problem due to increase in 
life expectancy. Implementation of standardised non-pharmacological delirium 
prevention strategies is challenging and adherence remains low. Pharmacological 
delirium prevention with haloperidol, currently the drug of choice for delirium, 
seems promising. However, the generalisability of randomised controlled trial 
results is questionable since studies have only been performed in selected 
postoperative hip-surgery and intensive care unit patient populations. We 
therefore present the design of the multicenter, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial on early pharmacological intervention to 
prevent delirium: haloperidol prophylaxis in older emergency department patients 
(The HARPOON study).
METHODS/DESIGN: In six Dutch hospitals, at-risk patients aged 70 years or older 
acutely admitted through the emergency department for general medicine and 
surgical specialties are randomised (n = 390) for treatment with prophylactic 
haloperidol 1 mg or placebo twice daily for a maximum of seven consecutive days. 
Primary outcome measure is the incidence of in-hospital delirium within seven 
days of start of the study intervention, diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment 
Method, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth 
edition criteria for delirium. Secondary outcome measures include delirium 
severity and duration assessed with the Delirium Rating Scale Revised 98; number 
of delirium-free days; adverse events; hospital length-of-stay; all-cause 
mortality; new institutionalisation; (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living 
assessed with the Katz Index of ADL, and Lawton IADL scale; cognitive function 
assessed with the Six-item Cognitive Impairment Test, and the Dutch short form 
Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Patients will be 
contacted by telephone three and six months post-discharge to collect data on 
cognitive- and physical function, home residency, all-cause hospital admissions, 
and all-cause mortality.
DISCUSSION: The HARPOON study will provide relevant information on the efficacy 
and safety of prophylactic haloperidol treatment for in-hospital delirium and 
its effects on relevant clinical outcomes in elderly at-risk medical and 
surgical patients.

BACKGROUND: Risk prediction in elderly patients is increasingly relevant due to 
longer life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine whether electrocardiographic (ECG) 
changes provide prognostic information incremental to current risk models and to 
the conventional risk factors.
METHODS: In all, 6,991 participants from the Copenhagen Heart Study attending an 
examination at age ≥65 years were included. ECG changes were defined as Q waves, 
ST-segment depression, T-wave changes, ventricular conduction defects, and left 
ventricular hypertrophy based on the Minnesota code. The primary endpoint was 
fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) event and the secondary was fatal or nonfatal 
CVD event. In our study, 2,236 fatal CVD and 3,849 fatal or nonfatal CVD events 
occurred during a median of 11.9 and 9.8 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: ECG changes were frequently present (30.6%) and associated with 
conventional risk factors. All ECG changes except 1 univariably predicted both 
endpoints. Event rates of ECG changes versus no ECG changes were respectively 
41.4% versus 27.8% and 64.6% versus 50.8%. When added to existing risk scores, 
ECG changes independently increased the risk of both endpoints. Fatal CVD 
events: hazard ratio (HR): 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 to 1.36; 
p < 0.001) and fatal or nonfatal CVD events: HR: 1.21 (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.24; p < 
0.001). When added to conventional risk factors, continuous net reclassification 
improvement was 42.3% (95% CI: 42.0 to 42.4; p < 0.001) for fatal and 29.2% (95% 
CI: 28.4 to 29.2; p < 0.001) for fatal or nonfatal events. Categorical net 
reclassification was 7.1% (95% CI: 6.7 to 9.0; p < 0.001) for fatal and 4.2% 
(95% CI: 3.5 to 5.6; p < 0.001) for fatal or nonfatal events.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple assessment of the existence of ECG changes improves risk 
prediction in the general population of persons age ≥65 years.

Recent advances in patient and proxy-reported quality of life research.

Bandayrel K, Johnston BC(1).

Author information:
(1)Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children Research 
Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. bradley.johnston@sickkids.ca.

BACKGROUND: A number of articles addressing various aspects of health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) were published in the Health and Quality of Life 
Outcomes (HQLO) journal in 2012 and 2013. This review provides a summary of 
studies describing recent methodological advances and innovations in HRQoL felt 
to be of relevance to clinicians and researchers.
METHODS: Scoping review of original research articles, reviews and short reports 
published in the HQLO journal in 2012 and 2013. Publications describing 
methodological advances and innovations in HRQoL were reviewed in detail, 
summarized and grouped into thematic categories.
RESULTS: 358 titles and abstracts were screened initially, and 16 were 
considered relevant and incorporated in this review. Two studies discussed 
development and interpretation of HRQoL outcomes; two described pediatric HRQoL 
measurement; four involved incorporation of HRQoL in economic evaluations; and 
eight described methodological issues and innovations in HRQoL measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Several studies describing important advancements and innovations 
in HRQoL, such as the development of the PROMIS pediatric proxy-item bank and 
guidelines for constructing patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments, were 
published in the HQLO journal in 2012 and 2013. Proposed future directions for 
the majority of these studies include extension and further validation of the 
research across a diverse range of health conditions.

Effectiveness of the population-based Check your health preventive programme 
conducted in primary care with 4 years follow-up [the CORE trial]: study 
protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

University, Bartholins Allé 2, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. htm@ph.au.dk.

BACKGROUND: The periodic health check-up has been a fundamental part of routine 
medical practice for decades, despite a lack of consensus regarding its value in 
health promotion and disease prevention. A large-scale Danish population-based 
preventive programme 'Check your health' was developed based on available 
evidence of screening and successive accepted treatment, prevention for diseases 
and health promotion, and is closely aligned with the current health care 
system.The objective of the 'Check your health' [CORE] trial is to investigate 
effectiveness on health outcomes of a preventive health check offered at a 
population-level to all individuals aged 30-49 years, and to establish the 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS/DESIGN: The trial will be conducted as a pragmatic household-cluster 
randomised controlled trial involving 10,505 individuals. All individuals within 
a well-defined geographical area in the Central Denmark Region, Denmark (DK) 
were randomised to be offered a preventive health check (Intervention group, n = 
5250) or to maintain routine access to healthcare until a delayed intervention 
(Comparison group, n = 5255). The programme consists of a health examination 
which yields an individual risk profile, and according to this participants are 
assigned to one of the following interventions: (a) referral to a health 
promoting consultation in general practice, (b) behavioural programmes at the 
local Health Centre, or (c) no need for follow-up.The primary outcomes at 4 
years follow-up are: ten-year-risk of fatal cardiovascular event (Heart-SCORE 
model), physical activity level (self-report and cardiorespiratory fitness), 
quality of life (SF12), sick leave and labour market attachment. 
Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated according to life years gained, direct 
costs and total health costs. Intention to treat analysis will be performed.
DISCUSSION: Results from the largest Danish health check programme conducted 
within the current healthcare system, spanning the sectors which share 
responsibility for the individual, will provide a scientific basis to be used in 
the development of systems to optimise population health in the 21st century.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with an ID: 
NCT02028195 (7. March 2014).

BACKGROUND: The KIDSCREEN-10 index and the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) are 
two recently developed generic instruments for the measurement of health-related 
quality of life in children and adolescents. Whilst the CHU9D is a preference 
based instrument developed specifically for application in cost-utility 
analyses, the KIDSCREEN-10 is not currently suitable for application in this 
context. This paper provides an algorithm for mapping the KIDSCREEN-10 index 
onto the CHU9D utility scores.
METHODS: A sample of 590 Australian adolescents (aged 11-17) completed both the 
KIDSCREEN-10 and the CHU9D. Several econometric models were estimated, including 
ordinary least squares estimator, censored least absolute deviations estimator, 
robust MM-estimator and generalised linear model, using a range of explanatory 
variables with KIDSCREEN-10 items scores as key predictors. The predictive 
performance of each model was judged using mean absolute error (MAE) and root 
mean squared error (RMSE).
RESULTS: The MM-estimator with stepwise-selected KIDSCREEN-10 items scores as 
explanatory variables had the best predictive accuracy using MAE, whilst the 
equivalent ordinary least squares model had the best predictive accuracy using 
RMSE.
CONCLUSIONS: The preferred mapping algorithm (i.e. the MM-estimate with stepwise 
selected KIDSCREEN-10 item scores as the predictors) can be used to predict 
CHU9D utility from KIDSCREEN-10 index with a high degree of accuracy. The 
algorithm may be usefully applied within cost-utility analyses to generate cost 
per quality adjusted life year estimates where KIDSCREEN-10 data only are 
available.

As the modern era of combination antiretroviral therapy has increased life 
expectancy for individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and disorders of glucose metabolism have emerged as an 
important issue in the care of this population. Multiple mechanisms, both 
specific and nonspecific to HIV, underlie a significant prevalence. Although 
best-practice diagnostic testing remains unclear, the risks associated with 
diabetes in the setting of HIV are well characterized, ranging from 
organ-specific damage to socioeconomic decline. As population-specific treatment 
data are limited, current guidelines serve as a basis for ongoing management.

The effect of different utility measures on the cost-effectiveness of bilateral 
cochlear implantation.

Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; School of Surgery, University of 
Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine if the choice of health utility measure 
affects the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) when assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implantation (CI).
STUDY DESIGN: A scenario-based estimate with three scenarios: 1) a patient with 
severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with no intervention, 2) the same 
patient with a unilateral CI with average or better performance, and 3) the same 
patient with bilateral CIs with average or better performance.
METHODS: One hundred and forty-two subjects comprising preimplantees (n = 30), 
unilateral cochlear implantees (n = 30), bilateral implantees (n = 30), and 
healthcare professionals (n = 52). The four health utility instruments applied 
were the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3), European Quality of Life 
Questionnaire in 5 Domains (EQ5D), visual analog scale (VAS), and time trade-off 
(TTO). Cost for each implant was based on a 25-year time horizon, 50% discount 
for the second implant, and a 15% failure rate.
RESULTS: Using the HUI3, the utility gain from unilateral to bilateral 
implantation was 0.035 or 11.5% of the total utility gain. This ratio was higher 
using the other instruments: EQ5D (22.2%), VAS (35.0%), and TTO (41.4%). For the 
scenario of bilateral CI compared to no intervention, HUI3 ICUR estimates were 
the lowest, and for bilateral CI compared to unilateral CI, HUI3 ICUR estimates 
were the highest.
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of utility instrument in cost-utility analysis of 
bilateral CI heavily influences whether the second implant is deemed 
cost-effective. The HUI3 is the utility of choice in CI studies and is the most 
conservative.

Gender and regional differentials in health expectancy in Greece.

Bagavos C(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Social Policy, Panteion University , Athens, Greece.

BACKGROUND: Differentials and inequalities in heath status are closely related 
to the implementation and the sustainability of public health policies. The 
paper investigates differences in health expectancy as an indicator of 
population health among regions and between genders.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on activity limitation, we compute Healthy Life Years 
indicator by applying the prevalence-based Sullivan method. The analysis is 
based on data from the National Health Survey conducted in Greece in 2009 by the 
Hellenic Statistical Authority, carried out on a multistage probability sample 
of 6172 individuals.
RESULTS: The results show that men are more likely than women to live a greater 
part of their life in good health. When regions are considered (NUTS_1 and 
NUTS_2 levels), the resulting diversities in healthy life years are more 
pronounced than those in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper provides additional insights about health status 
discrepancies among Greek geographic regions and between genders. The results 
indicate that men are more likely to report to be in good health than women, and 
the differences by gender are more pronounced at regional than at national 
level. This empirical evidence can be used for monitoring both, the population 
health status and the undesired differentials in health expectancy, and may 
therefore be a useful tool for health policies aiming at reducing heath 
inequalities among individuals. Significance for public healthHealth expectancy 
differentials challenge the debate about health policies aiming at reducing 
heath inequalities among individuals. The paper suggests that health status 
discrepancies measured by healthy life years' indicator are pronounced among 
regions and between genders. Our findings have implications for several issues 
related to public health policies and, in particular, those referring to 
prevention, the universal access to health services as well as the quality of 
the provision of health care services. Monitoring both the health status of the 
population and the undesired differentials in health expectancy should help to 
avoid an expansion of morbidity and to reduce the unequal distribution of 
population's health status.

BACKGROUND: A recent Cochrane Review found that preoperative biliary drainage 
(PBD) in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer undergoing 
surgery for obstructive jaundice is associated with similar mortality but 
increased serious morbidity compared with no PBD. Despite this clinical evidence 
of its lack of effectiveness, PBD is still in use. We considered the economic 
implications of PBD versus direct surgery for obstructive jaundice in patients 
with pancreatic and periampullary cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Model-based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the 
UK National Health Service over a 6-month time horizon. A decision tree model 
was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes, and cost data from 
published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken.
RESULTS: PBD was more costly than direct surgery (mean cost per patient £10,775 
[$15,616] versus £8221 [$11,914]) and produced fewer QALYs (mean QALYs per 
patient 0.337 versus 0.343). Not performing PBD would result in cost savings of 
approximately £2500 ($3623) per patient to the National Health Service. PBD had 
<10% probability of being cost-effective at a maximum willingness to pay for a 
QALY of £20,000 ($28,986) to £30,000 ($43,478).
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant cost savings to be gained by avoiding routine 
PBD in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary cancer where PBD is 
still routinely used in this context; this economic evidence should be used to 
support the clinical argument for a change in practice.

OBJECTIVE: Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults is associated with 
cardiovascular complications, which lead to reduced life expectancy. At present, 
data on cardiovascular risk factors in GHD children are limited. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate whether pre-pubertal GHD children have increased 
cardiovascular risk factors, and whether 12-month growth hormone (GH) treatment 
can reverse them.
DESIGN: Twenty pre-pubertal GHD children (6 boys, mean (±SD) age: 9.5±1.8 years) 
were matched for sex and age with 20 healthy controls (6 boys, mean (±SD) age: 
8.8±1.5 years). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), lipid profile, glucose 
metabolism parameters, IGF-1, blood pressure and anthropometric parameters were 
assessed at baseline and after 12 months of GH treatment.
RESULTS: At baseline, GHD patients showed significantly higher ADMA levels 
(median [interquartile range]: 78.5 [69.6-123.5] vs 54.0 [38.3-60.8] ng/ml, 
p<0.001), total cholesterol (mean±SD: 177.5±30.4 vs 150.1±21.4 mg/dl; p=0.004) 
and LDL-cholesterol (mean±SD: 111.2±22.2 vs 84.9±15.9 mg/dl; p<0.001) than 
controls. After 12-month GH treatment, ADMA (median [interquartile range]: 55.4 
[51.2-73.8] ng/ml), total cholesterol (mean±SD: 155.6±43.2 mg/dl), and 
LDL-cholesterol (mean±SD: 95.4±32.1 mg/dl) significantly decreased in GHD 
children, reaching values comparable to those in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that, as in adults, pre-pubertal GHD children 
manifest increased cardiovascular risk markers and that 12-month GH treatment 
can improve them.

Telomere homeostasis is regulated by telomere-associated proteins, and the Myb 
domain is well conserved for telomere binding. AtTRB2 is a member of the SMH 
(Single-Myb-Histone)-like family in Arabidopsis thaliana, having an N-terminal 
Myb domain, which is responsible for DNA binding. The Myb domain of AtTRB2 
contains three α-helices and loops for DNA binding, which is unusual given that 
other plant telomere-binding proteins have an additional fourth helix that is 
essential for DNA binding. To understand the structural role for telomeric DNA 
binding of AtTRB2, we determined the solution structure of the Myb domain of 
AtTRB2 (AtTRB21-64) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In 
addition, the inter-molecular interaction between AtTRB21-64 and telomeric DNA 
has been characterized by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and 
NMR titration analyses for both plant (TTTAGGG)n and human (TTAGGG)n telomere 
sequences. Data revealed that Trp28, Arg29, and Val47 residues located in Helix 
2 and Helix 3 are crucial for DNA binding, which are well conserved among other 
plant telomere binding proteins. We concluded that although AtTRB2 is devoid of 
the additional fourth helix in the Myb-extension domain, it is able to bind to 
plant telomeric repeat sequences as well as human telomeric repeat sequences.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis of the 
Education, Self-management and Upper Limb Exercise Training in People with RA 
(EXTRA) programme compared with usual care.
METHODS: A within-trial incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted with 108 
participants randomized to either the EXTRA programme (n = 52) or usual care (n 
= 56). A health care perspective was assumed for the primary analysis with a 36 
week follow-up. Resource use information was collected on interventions, 
medication, primary and secondary care contacts, private health care and social 
care costs. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQol 
five-dimension three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire responses at baseline, 12 
and 36 weeks.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, total QALYs gained were higher in the EXTRA 
programme, leading to an increase of 0.0296 QALYs. The mean National Health 
Service (NHS) costs per participant were slightly higher in the EXTRA programme 
(by £82), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2770 per 
additional QALY gained. Thus the EXTRA programme was cost effective from an NHS 
perspective when assessed against the threshold of £20 000-£30 000/QALY gained. 
Overall, costs were lower in the EXTRA programme compared with usual care, 
suggesting it was the dominant treatment option from a societal perspective. At 
a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY gained, there was a 65% probability that 
the EXTRA programme was the most cost-effective option. These results were 
robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for missing data, changing the cost 
perspective and removing cost outliers.
CONCLUSION: The physiotherapist-led EXTRA programme represents a cost-effective 
use of resources compared with usual care and leads to lower health care costs 
and work absence.

Inherent and acquired multiple drug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapeutic drugs 
is a major obstacle in cancer treatment. The ATP Binding Cassettes (ABC) 
transporter super family that act as extrusion pumps such as P-glycoprotein and 
multidrug-resistance-associated-proteins have prominent roles in cancer MDR. One 
of the most efficient strategies to modulate this active drug efflux from the 
cells is to physically block the pump proteins and thus change the balance 
between drug influx and efflux toward an accumulation of drug inside the cell, 
which eventually cumulates into cell death. MDR modulators (also known as 
chemosensitizers) were found among drugs approved for non-cancer indications. 
Yet, toxicity, adverse effects, and poor solubility at doses required for MDR 
reversal prevent their clinical application. Previous reports have shown that 
drugs belonging to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) family, 
which are clinically used as antidepressants, can act as effective 
chemosensitizers both in vitro and in vivo in tumor bearing mouse models. Here, 
we set out to explore whether sertraline (Zoloft®), a molecule belonging to the 
SSRI family, can be used as an MDR modulator. Combining sertraline with another 
FDA approved drug, Doxil® (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), is expected to 
enhance the effect of chemotherapy while potentially reducing adverse effects. 
Our findings reveal that sertraline acts as a pump modulator in cellular models 
of MDR. In addition, in an aggressive and highly resistant human ovarian 
xenograft mouse model the use of sertraline in combination with Doxil® generated 
substantial reduction in tumor progression, with extension of the median 
survival of tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results show that sertraline 
could act as a clinically relevant cancer MDR inhibitor. Moreover, combining two 
FDA approved drugs, DOXIL®, which favor the influx of chemotherapy inside the 
malignant cell with sertraline, which blocks the extrusion pumps, could readily 
be available for clinical translation in the battle against resistant tumors.

Along with the increase in life expectancy over the last century comes the 
increased risk for development of age-related disorders, including metabolic and 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's 
diseases. These chronic disorders share two main characteristics: 1) neuronal 
loss in motor, sensory or cognitive systems, leading to cognitive and motor 
decline; and 2) a strong correlation between metabolic changes and 
neurodegeneration. In order to treat them, a better understanding of their 
complexity is required: it is necessary to interpret the neuronal damage in 
light of the metabolic changes, and to find the disrupted link between the 
peripheral organs governing energy metabolism and the CNS. This review is an 
attempt to present ghrelin as part of molecular regulatory interface between 
energy metabolism, neuroendocrine and neurodegenerative processes. Ghrelin takes 
part in lipid and glucose metabolism, in higher brain functions such as 
sleep-wake state, learning and memory consolidation; it influences mitochondrial 
respiration and shows neuroprotective effect. All these make ghrelin an 
attractive target for development of biomarkers or therapeutics for prevention 
or treatment of disorders, in which cell protection and recruitment of new 
neurons or synapses are needed.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life expectancy (HLE) varies among demographic segments of 
the US population and by geography. To quantify that variation, we estimated the 
national and regional HLE for the US population by sex, race/ethnicity and 
geographic region in 2008.
METHODS: National HLEs were calculated using the published 2008 life table and 
the self-reported health status data from the National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS). Regional HLEs were calculated using the combined 2007-09 mortality, 
population and NHIS health status data.
RESULTS: In 2008, HLE in the USA varied significantly by sex, race/ethnicity and 
geographical regions. At 25 years of age, HLE for females was 47.3 years and
