Thirty- and 90-day mortality was 3.3 and 8.7% in group 1 and 4.8 and 14.3% in 
group 2 (p = 0.617 and p = 0.242, respectively). Three-year overall survival was 
54.6% in group 1 and 31.3% in group 2 (p = 0.03). Three-year cancer-specific 
survival was 64.8% in group 1 and 38.8% in group 2 (p = 0.037). Recurrence-free 
survival was 105 months in group 1 and 12 months in group 2 (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: In light of increasing life expectancy in western nations, we sought 
to evaluate the impact of age in a large series of elderly patients undergoing 
RC for UCB. We found that RC offers acceptable perioperative complication rates 
in the oldest-old patient cohort (≥85 years). Therefore, RC for UCB can be 
offered as a viable treatment option even in the oldest patients.

Liver cirrhosis is a frequent condition with high impact on patients' life 
expectancy and health care systems. Cirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) gradually 
develops with deteriorating liver function and can lead to life-threatening 
complications. Other than an increase in intrahepatic flow resistance due to 
morphological remodeling of the organ, a functional dysregulation of the 
sinusoids, the smallest functional units of liver vasculature, plays a pivotal 
role. Vascular tone is primarily regulated by the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, wherein soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and 
phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) are key enzymes. Recent data showed characteristic 
alterations in the expression of these regulatory enzymes or metabolite levels 
in liver cirrhosis. Additionally, a disturbed zonation of the components of this 
pathway along the sinusoids was detected. This review describes current 
knowledge of the pathophysiology of PH with focus on the enzymes regulating cGMP 
availability, i.e., sGC and PDE-5. The results have primarily been obtained in 
animal models of liver cirrhosis. However, clinical and histochemical data 
suggest that the new biochemical model we propose can be applied to human liver 
cirrhosis. The role of PDE-5 as potential target for medical therapy of PH is 
discussed.

The purpose of this article is to study whether the position occupied by 
footballers on the pitch influences their life duration. It is known that 
various types of sporting activity (endurance, resistance, or mixed) may 
influence lifespan in different ways. However, there is a paucity of data 
regarding the role of different positions played in team sports such as 
football. Our research was based on elite international football players born 
before 1923 who took part in the first three football World Cups (n = 443) or 
played in the 1946/1947 season in the leading clubs of the main European leagues 
(n = 280). Goalkeepers were characterized by a 5-8-year longer life duration 
compared to their colleagues playing in other positions (World Cup: 82.0 ± 7.0 
vs. 74.0 ± 8.0, p = 0.0047; European leagues: 83.0 ± 7.5 vs. 78.0 ± 8.0, p = 
0.0023), with an absence of differences between defenders, midfielders, and 
forwards. Moreover, in both of the analyzed subgroups, the rate of survival 
until the 85th birthday was significantly higher among goalkeepers than among 
field players (p = 0.0102 and p = 0.0048, for both studied groups, 
respectively).

Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world. However, this does not 
guarantee an improved quality of life. There is a gap between life expectancy 
and healthy life expectancy. This study aimed to reveal the features of healthy 
life expectancy across all secondary medical areas (n = 344) in Japan and 
examine the relationship among healthcare resources, life expectancy, and 
healthy life expectancy at birth. Data were collected from Japan's population 
registry and long-term insurance records. Differences in healthy life expectancy 
by gender were calculated using the Sullivan method. Maps of healthy life 
expectancy were drawn up. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were 
used for analysis. The findings revealed significant regional disparities. The 
number of doctors and therapists, support clinics for home healthcare facilities 
and home-visit treatments, and dentistry expenditure per capita were positively 
correlated with life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (correlation 
coefficients > 0.2). They also revealed gender differences. Despite controlling 
for population density, inequalities in healthy life expectancy were observed, 
highlighting the need to promote social policies to reduce regional disparities. 
Japanese policymakers should consider optimal levels of health resources to 
improve life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. The geographical 
distribution of healthcare resources should also be reconstituted.

Fresh pasta is subjected to rapid spoilage, mainly due to the metabolic activity 
of bacteria, yeasts, and especially molds, which negatively affect the sensorial 
characteristics and the safety of the product. In this work, chickpea flour was 
fermented with selected lactic acid bacteria, characterized in terms of the 
antifungal activity, and used to fortify fresh semolina pasta. Pasta was 
characterized and subjected to a long period of storage after being artificially 
inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti. Conventional fresh semolina pasta, 
produced with or without calcium propionate addition, was used as a reference. 
The water/salt-soluble extract from chickpea sourdough exhibited antifungal 
activity towards a large spectrum of molds. Its purification led to the 
identification of ten potentially active peptides. Besides the high content of 
dietary fibers (4.37%) and proteins (11.20%), nutritional improvements, such as 
the decrease of the antinutritional factors concentration and the starch 
hydrolysis index (25% lower than the control) and the increase of the protein 
digestibility (36% higher than the control), were achieved in fresh pasta 
fortified with the chickpea sourdough. Inhibition of the indicator mold growth 
during a 40-day storage period was more effective than in pasta added to calcium 
propionate.

BACKGROUND: Prognostic awareness (PA)-the understanding of limited life 
expectancy-is critical for effective goals of care discussions (GOCD) in which 
patients discuss their goals and values in the context of their illness. Yet 
little is known about PA and GOCD in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). 
This study aims to determine the prevalence of PA among patients with advanced 
HF and patient characteristics associated with PA and GOCD.
METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of self-reported PA and GOCD using data from 
a multisite communication intervention trial among patients with advanced HF 
with an implantable cardiac defibrillator at high risk of death.
RESULTS: Of 377 patients (mean age 62 years, 30% female, 42% nonwhite), 78% had 
PA. Increasing age was a negative predictor of PA (odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 
0.92-0.97]; P<0.01). No other patient characteristics were associated with PA. 
Of those with PA, 26% had a GOCD. Higher comorbidities and prior advance 
directives were associated with GOCD but were of only borderline statistical 
significance in a fully adjusted model. Symptom severity (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% 
CI, 1.19-2.64]; P=0.005) remained a robust and statistically significant 
positive predictor of having a GOCD in the fully adjusted model.
CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of patients with advanced HF, the frequency of PA was 
high, but fewer patients with PA discussed their end-of-life care preferences 
with their physician. Improved efforts are needed to ensure all patients with 
advanced HF have an opportunity to have GOCD with their doctors. Clinicians may 
need to target older patients with HF and continue to focus on those with signs 
of worsening illness (higher symptoms). Registration: URL:

BACKGROUND: Guanine-rich sequences are able to form complex RNA structures 
termed RNA G-quadruplexes in vitro. Because of their high stability, RNA 
G-quadruplexes are proposed to exist in vivo and are suggested to be associated 
with important biological relevance. However, there is a lack of direct evidence 
for RNA G-quadruplex formation in living eukaryotic cells. Therefore, it is 
unclear whether any purported functions are associated with the specific 
sequence content or the formation of an RNA G-quadruplex structure.
RESULTS: Using rG4-seq, we profile the landscape of those guanine-rich regions 
with the in vitro folding potential in the Arabidopsis transcriptome. We find a 
global enrichment of RNA G-quadruplexes with two G-quartets whereby the folding 
potential is strongly influenced by RNA secondary structures. Using in vitro and 
in vivo RNA chemical structure profiling, we determine that hundreds of RNA 
G-quadruplex structures are strongly folded in both Arabidopsis and rice, 
providing direct evidence of RNA G-quadruplex formation in living eukaryotic 
cells. Subsequent genetic and biochemical analyses show that RNA G-quadruplex 
folding is able to regulate translation and modulate plant growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the existence of RNA G-quadruplex in vivo and 
indicates that RNA G-quadruplex structures act as important regulators of plant 
development and growth.

Lung carcinoma is one of the most common human cancers and is estimated to have 
an incidence of approximately 2 million new cases per year worldwide with a 20% 
mortality rate. Lung cancer represents one of the leading causes of cancer 
related death in the world. Of all cancer types to affect the pulmonary system, 
non-small cell lung carcinoma comprises approximately 80-85% of all tumors. In 
the past few decades cytogenetic and advanced molecular techniques have helped 
define the genomic landscape of lung cancer, and in the process, revolutionized 
the clinical management and treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer. The discovery of specific, recurrent genetic abnormalities has led 
to the development of targeted therapies that have extended the life expectancy 
of patients who develop carcinoma of the lungs. Patients are now routinely 
treated with targeted therapies based on identifiable molecular alterations or 
other predictive biomarkers which has led to a revolution in the field of 
pulmonary pathology and oncology. Numerous different testing modalities, with 
various strengths and limitations now exist which complicate diagnostic 
algorithms, however recently emerging consensus guidelines and recommendations 
have begun to standardize the way to approach diagnostic testing of lung 
carcinoma. Herein we provide an overview of the molecular genetic landscape of 
non-small cell lung carcinoma, with attention to those clinically relevant 
alterations which drive management, as well as review current recommendations 
for molecular testing.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic and endocrine disorder characterised by 
hyperglycaemia. Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for >90% of people with 
diabetes. Disorders of blood glucose metabolism and a series of adverse 
reactions triggered by hyperglycaemia-such as oxidative stress and 
inflammation-are conducive to the occurrence of diabetic macrovascular 
complications, which pose severe challenges to the quality of life and life 
expectancy of people with diabetes. In recent years, epigenetics has attracted 
more and more researchers' attention as they explore the causes and treatment of 
diabetes. Epigenetics refers to the regulation of gene expression without 
changes in gene content. Research focusses on DNA methylation, histone 
post-translational modification and non-coding RNA. A series of studies have 
shown that epigenetic regulation accelerates the development of atherosclerosis 
by interfering with the physiological activities of macrophages, endothelial 
cells and smooth muscle cells, such as inflammation, lipid deposition and 
apoptosis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore new epigenetic 
discoveries to reduce the severity and harmfulness of diabetes. This study 
reviewed recent advances in epigenetics in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus 
and its macrovascular complications.

Olfactory loss can be acquired (patients with a history of olfactory 
experiences), or inborn (patients without olfactory experiences/life-long 
inability to smell). Inborn olfactory loss, or congenital anosmia (CA), is 
relatively rare and there is a knowledge gap regarding the compensatory neural 
mechanisms involved in this condition. The study aimed to investigate the 
top-down olfactory processing in patients with CA or idiopathic acquired anosmia 
(IA) in comparison to normosmia controls (NC) during expectancy and reading of 
odor-associated words. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess 
brain activations in 14 patients with CA, 8 patients with IA, and 16 NC healthy 
participants during an expectancy and reading task. Words with strong olfactory 
associations (OW) (e.g. "banana") or with little or no olfactory associations 
(CW) (e.g. "chair") were used as stimuli and were presented with a block design 
Analyses were conducted to explore the brain activation in response to OW 
expectancy or OW reading between groups (CW as baseline). During the expectancy 
condition of OW, IA and NC groups showed stronger activation in posterior OFC 
extending to right insula, caudate region and frontal medial OFC respectively. 
Whereas during the reading condition of OW, CA patients showed stronger 
activation in posterior OFC extending to the insula. Increased activation of 
higher-order brain regions related to multisensory integration among CA patients 
suggests a compensatory mechanism for processing semantic olfactory cues.

Pseudoplanktonic crinoid raft colonies are an enigma of the Jurassic. These raft 
colonies are thought to have developed as floating filter-feeding communities 
due to an exceptionally rich oceanic niche, high in the water column enabling 
them to reach large densities on these log rafts. However, this pseudoplanktonic 
hypothesis has not been quantitatively tested, and there remains some doubt that 
this mode of life was possible. The ecological structure of the crinoid colony 
is resolved using spatial point process analyses and the duration estimates of 
the floating system until sinking using moisture diffusion models. Using spatial 
analysis, we found that the crinoids would have trailed preferentially 
positioned at the back of the floating log in the regions of least resistance, 
consistent with a floating, not benthic ecology. Additionally, we found using a 
series of moisture diffusion models at different log densities and sizes that 
ecosystem collapse did not take place solely due to colonies becoming overladen 
as previously assumed. Our analyses have found that these crinoid colonies 
studied could have existed for more than 10 years, even up to 20 years, 
exceeding the life expectancy of modern documented raft systems with possible 
implications for the role of modern raft communities in the biotic colonization 
of oceanic islands and intercontinental dispersal of marine and terrestrial 
species.

BACKGROUND: Several sophisticated techniques and many chemotherapy drugs have 
improved life expectancy of oncologic patients allowing us to observe late 
complications which present many years after the initial treatment.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a unique case of a patient affected by acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 6 years, treated with whole brain 
radiotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy, developing meningiomatosis and 
leptomeningeal alterations as late complications and the interaction of these 
two entities caused a peculiar form of hydrocephalus without ventricular 
dilation. The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was excluded due the 
postradio/chemotherapy development of meningiomatosis, not present in a 
previously head magnetic resonance imaging, that exerted compression to the 
Sylvian aqueduct causing intracranial hypertension with papillary stasis without 
ventricles enlargement due to brain stiffness. Moreover, a peculiar 
intraoperative rubbery consistency of brain parenchyma was detected 
strengthening this complex diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 
obstructive hydrocephalus without ventricles dilation caused by brain stiffness 
related to late alterations of oncologic treatments. This report could be a 
guide for further complex patients diagnoses and for improving treatments 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Previous investigations of the relationship between marital status 
and life expectancy and healthy life expectancy rely on the assumption that 
participants will remain in a given marital status until death. This study 
estimated total life expectancy (TLE) and active life expectancy (ALE) for 
respondents by their baseline marital status using a large longitudinal sample 
of the U.S. community-dwelling elderly population.
METHODS: Data were from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Cohort 15 (2012 
baseline, 2014 follow-up). We included respondents aged ≥65 years (n = 164,597). 
Multi-state models estimated TLE and ALE by marital status to allow 
participants' marital status to change during the remaining lifetime.
RESULTS: Between 65 and 85 years, married men and women had a longer TLE and ALE 
than unmarried men and women. For example, at 65 years, TLE for married men was 
18.6 years, 2.2 years longer than unmarried men, and ALE for married men was 
12.3 years, 2.4 years longer than unmarried men. Similarly, at 65 years, TLE for 
married women was 21.1 years, 1.5 years longer than unmarried women, and ALE for 
married women was 13.0 years, 2.0 years longer than unmarried women. Such 
marriage protection effects decreased with age. In subgroups of unmarried 
persons, never married persons had the shortest TLE and ALE among men, and never 
married, divorced, and widowed persons had a similar, and shorter, TLE and ALE 
among women. The difference in TLE between married and unmarried persons was 
smaller after adjusting for baseline activity limitation status.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional evidence for marriage's protective 
effect, with the magnitude of protection being greater for younger as compared 
to older persons. Selection bias was a large contributor to longer life 
expectancy among married persons.

In social insects, workers and queens arise from the same genome but display 
profound differences in behavior and longevity. In Harpegnathos saltator ants, 
adult workers can transition to a queen-like state called gamergate, which 
results in reprogramming of social behavior and life-span extension. Using 
single-cell RNA sequencing, we compared the distribution of neuronal and glial 
populations before and after the social transition. We found that the conversion 
of workers into gamergates resulted in the expansion of neuroprotective 
ensheathing glia. Brain injury assays revealed that activation of the damage 
response gene Mmp1 was weaker in old workers, where the relative frequency of 
ensheathing glia also declined. On the other hand, long-lived gamergates 
retained a larger fraction of ensheathing glia and the ability to mount a strong 
Mmp1 response to brain injury into old age. We also observed molecular and 
cellular changes suggestive of age-associated decline in ensheathing glia in 
Drosophila.

Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND: The elderly population in India is expected to grow enormously by 
2050 owing to an increase in life expectancy. Community-based data on the 
prevalence of psychological morbidity, abuse and cognitive dysfunction are 
scarce.
AIMS: To determine the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, psychological 
morbidity and abuse in the elderly population in a resettlement colony from East 
Delhi, India.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the elderly population of a 
resettlement colony, in East Delhi, comprising 5 blocks and 12 subblocks with a 
total population of 65 000. The study was carried out within 2 months from April 
to August 2017. The self-reported questionnaires were administered to detect 
cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity, social support and pattern of 
abuse.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study subjects was 70.29 years (53.8% were males, 
78.8% were married, 86.9% were Hindus and 75% were living with children). A 
total of 106 subjects (66.6%) belonged to the lower socioeconomic strata with 
120 (75%) living with children. Most of the subjects (70.6%) studied below the 
primary level of education. As detected on Goldberg General Health 
Questionnaire-12, 56.9% of the subjects had psychological morbidity. On Dementia 
Assessment by Rapid Test, 33.1% of subjects were screened positive. The pattern 
of abuse reported was as follows: emotional abuse (16.9%), physical abuse 
(7.5%), sexual abuse (1.9%) and social neglect (18.1%). The social support score 
was found to be 46.22 (12.22).
CONCLUSION: The results of this community-based study signify that appropriate 
steps at the policy level need to be undertaken so that abuse as well as neglect 
can be prevented. In addition, screening the elderly population helps to detect 
early cognitive dysfunction, psychological morbidity, abuse victims and 
individuals with poor support.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) considered 
evidence for voretigene neparvovec (VN; Luxturna®) for the treatment of 
RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) within its highly specialised 
technology programme. This paper summarises the evidence provided by the 
company; the appraisal of the evidence by the Peninsula Technology Appraisal 
Group, who were commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group 
(ERG); and the development of the NICE guidance by the appraisal committee. The 
evidence presented by the company highlighted the significant lifelong burden of 
IRD for patients and carers. Evidence to support the effectiveness of VN was 
lacking, but the available evidence showed a modest, sustained improvement 
across a variety of vision-related outcomes. While patients would remain 
visually impaired, the committee considered that VN would prevent further 
deterioration in vision. The modelling approach used by the company had a number 
of limitations and relied heavily upon a large volume of clinical expert input 
to produce cost-effectiveness estimates with large uncertainty around long-term 
effectiveness. The ERG's main concerns revolved around these long-term outcomes 
and the plausibility of utility values. The NICE committee were convinced that 
the clinical benefits of VN were important and an appropriate use of national 
health service resources within a specialised service. The committee concluded 
that a high unmet need existed in patients with RPE65-mediated IRD and that VN 
represents a step change in the management of this condition.

Pennsylvania, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Many healthcare disparities exist between men and women due to 
differences in lifestyles and health seeking behaviors. Such differences lead to 
higher mortality and lower life expectancy in men. The field of urology has the 
unique opportunity of acting as a gateway to men's overall health, where a 
urologist can diagnose medical diseases in patients and refer them to the 
appropriate specialist. In this review article we discuss the need for men's 
health programs and our experience with creating such program in Philadelphia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this review article we outline our experience with 
creating a men's health program to serve the diverse Philadelphia population. We 
discuss the healthcare needs and demographics of our geographical area.
RESULTS: We identify factors essential for the success of our men's health 
program such as: developing a business model, drawing support from our 
institution, identifying key medical specialties to include in the program, 
assigning patient navigators and integration of electronic medical records.
CONCLUSION: Men's health program provide tailored care for male patients that 
best suits their needs and healthcare seeking behaviors. The success of such 
programs requires commitment from physicians from many medical specialties to 
provide holistic care.

BACKGROUND: THA is a reasonable surgical option for some patients with fragility 
fractures of the femoral neck, but it has the risk of prosthesis dislocation. 
The prosthesis combination that reduces the risk of dislocation and the rate of 
revision surgery is not known.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In patients receiving primary THA for a femoral neck 
fracture, does (1) the rate of all-cause revision or (2) the reason for revision 
and rate of revision for dislocation differ among THA with a standard head size, 
large head size, dual mobility (DM), or constrained liner? (3) Is there a 
difference in the revision risk when patients are stratified by age at the time 
of surgery?
METHODS: Data were analyzed for 16,692 THAs performed to treat fractures of the 
femoral neck reported in the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint 
Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) from January 2008 to December 2018, as this 
included the first use of DM prostheses. The AOANJRR includes information on 
more than 98% of arthroplasty procedures performed in Australia. Most patients 
were female (72%) and the mean age was 74 years ± 11. There were 8582 
standard-head prostheses, 5820 large-head prostheses, 1778 DM prostheses, and 
512 constrained prostheses identified. The cumulative percent revision (CPR) was 
determined for all causes as well as CPR for dislocation. The time to the first 
revision was described using Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship, with right 
censoring for death or closure of the database at the time of analysis. The 
unadjusted CPR was estimated each year of the first 10 years for standard heads, 
10 years for large heads, 8 years for constrained liners, and 7 years for DM 
prostheses, with 95% confidence intervals using unadjusted pointwise Greenwood 
estimates. The results were adjusted for age, sex, femoral fixation, and head 
size where appropriate and were considered by age groups < 70 and ≥ 70 years.
RESULTS: When adjusted for age, sex, femoral fixation and head size, there was 
no difference in the rate of all-cause revision at 7 years for any of the four 
groups. There was no difference in the rate of all-cause revision when patients 
were stratified by < 70 or ≥ 70 years of age. Dislocation was the most common 
reason for revision (32%). When analyzing revision for dislocation alone, 
large-head THA had a lower rate of revision for dislocation compared with 
standard head (HR 0.6 [95% CI 0.4 to 0.8]; p < 0.001) and DM prostheses had a 
lower rate of revision for dislocation than standard head for the first 3 months 
(HR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.7]; p < 0.004) but not after this time point.
CONCLUSION: The Australian registry shows that there is no difference in the 
rate of all-cause revision for standard-head, large-head, DM prostheses or 
constrained liner THA after femoral neck fractures for all patients or for 
patients stratified into younger than 70 years and at least 70 years of age 
groups. Dislocation is the most common cause of revision. Large-head prostheses 
are associated with a lower revision risk for dislocation and DM prostheses have 
a lower rate of revision for dislocation than standard heads for the first 3 
months only. Surgeons treating a femoral neck fracture with THA might consider a 
large head size if the diameter of the acetabulum will allow it and a DM 
prosthesis if a large head size is not possible. The age, life expectancy and 
level of function of patients with femoral neck fractures minimizes the 
potential long-term consequences of these prostheses. The lack of significant 
differences in survival between most prosthesis combinations means surgeons 
should continue to look for factors beyond head size and prosthesis to minimize 
dislocation and revision surgery.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

In recent years, applications of cold plasma treatments have shown high 
efficiency in sterilization of fresh fruit and vegetables. With encouraging 
results, development of this technique focuses on influences of cold plasma on 
the quality attributes of these fresh produce. More studies found that the 
quality attributes are maintained in an acceptable range or can even be improved 
under certain plasma treatment conditions. This review provides an overview of 
the multiple effects of cold plasma on the fresh produce, in terms of physical, 
chemical and physiological aspects. Besides, the possible mechanisms of how 
plasma influences these quality attributes is elaborated, which is useful for 
further modification and improvement of the plasma technology, so that quality 
enhancement and shelf life extension can be achieved. Future trends in the 
development of cold plasma technology are also presented. Cold plasma treatment 
is a potential technology for treating fresh fruit and vegetables to enhance 
their quality and extend their shelf life. However, knowledge of the effects of 
cold plasma on the quality changes of fresh fruit and vegetables is still 
limited. Therefore, there is a need for future studies to understand the 
mechanisms of plasma effects on controlling the interactions between plasma and 
food products in order to realize the early adoption of the technology to the 
food industry.

Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (FAODs) are a group of about 20 
diseases which are caused by specific mutations in genes that codify proteins or 
enzymes involved in the fatty acid transport and mitochondrial β-oxidation. As a 
consequence of these inherited metabolic defects, fatty acids can not be used as 
an appropriate energetic source during special conditions, such as prolonged 
fasting, exercise or other catabolic states. Therefore, patients usually present 
hepatopathy, cardiomyopathy, severe skeletal myopathy and neuropathy, besides 
biochemical features like hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hypotony 
and hyperammonemia. This set of symptoms seems to be related not only with the 
energy deficiency, but also with toxic effects provoked by fatty acids and 
carnitine derivatives accumulated in the tissues of the patients. The 
understanding of the mechanisms by which these metabolites provoke tissue injury 
in FAODs is crucial for the developmental of novel therapeutic strategies that 
promote increased life expectancy, as well as improved life quality for 
patients. In this sense, the objective of this review is to present evidence 
from the scientific literature on the role of oxidative damage and mitochondrial 
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent FAODs: medium-chain 
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
(LCHAD) and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiencies. It is 
expected that the findings presented in this review, obtained from both animal 
model and patients studies, may contribute to a better comprehension of the 
pathophysiology of these diseases.
