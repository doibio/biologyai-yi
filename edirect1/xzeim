BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated mental health disorders comprehensively 
among patients with prostate cancer on long-term follow-up. The primary aim of 
our study was to assess the incidence of mental health disorders among patients 
with prostate cancer compared with a general population cohort. A secondary aim 
was to investigate potential risk factors for mental health disorders among 
patients with prostate cancer.
METHODS: Cohorts of 18 134 patients with prostate adenocarcinomas diagnosed 
between 2004 and 2017 and 73470 men without cancer matched on age, birth state, 
and follow-up time were identified. Mental health diagnoses were identified from 
electronic health records and statewide health-care facilities data. Cox 
proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios. All statistical 
tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS: The hazard ratios for mood disorders, including depression, among 
prostate cancer survivors increased for all follow-up periods compared with the 
general population. The hazard ratios for any mental illness increased with 
Hispanic, Black, or multiple races; people who were underweight or obese; those 
with advanced prostate cancer; and those undergoing their first course cancer 
treatment. We also observed statistically significantly increased hazard ratios 
for mental health disorders among patients with lower socioeconomic status 
(P < .0001) and increasing duration of androgen-deprivation therapy (P = .0348). 
Prostate cancer survivors had a 61% increased hazard ratio for death with a 
depression diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of 
mental health disorders compared with the general population, which was observed 
as long as 10-16 years after cancer diagnosis. Providing long-term mental health 
support may be beneficial to increasing life expectancy for patients with 
prostate cancer.

AIM: Laryngeal cancers are redoubtable because they are still diagnosed in 
advanced stages which results in poor survival and the decline of life quality. 
The authors intend to identify if the tumor topography influences clinical 
behavior, the morphological profile and therapeutic strategy.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 188 patients with 
laryngeal malignancies diagnosed and treated in an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) 
Department. The patients have been divided into four groups according to the 
tumor topography and extension. Three categories of parameters were defined 
(epidemiological, clinical, and morphological) and analyzed comparatively 
between the four groups using filter scales and the χ² (chi-squared) correlation 
test.
RESULTS: Epidemiological parameters (sex, age, socio-economic status) showed no 
significant differences between the four groups. Clinical parameters (symptoms, 
lymphadenopathies, surgical procedures, and hospitalization) instead registered 
significant differences between the four groups. Morphological parameters 
(longitudinal diameter, transverse diameter, shape, gross aspect, 
histopathological aspect, grade, local invasion - pT, lymph node invasion - pN, 
metastases - pM and tumor stage), excepting shape, registered too significant 
differences between the four groups. The analysis of the whole set of parameters 
in each group revealed different, distinct profiles for each of the topographic 
groups, especially for glottic and large tumors. Our results concerning the 
entire series of tumors ranged in the limits of variation of each of the 
parameters observed in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that tumors placed in different regions of the 
larynx have distinct profiles from epidemiological, clinical, and morphological 
points of view. However, the profile of our entire group of tumors proved to be 
comparable with the literature data.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurological disorder 
that can affect all age groups. It appears to have a higher incidence in the 
female population. Some common risk factors include hypertension, electrolyte 
abnormalities, sepsis, and chemotherapeutic medications such as Obinutuzumab. 
Our patient, who had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), presented with altered 
mental status. She was recently started on Obinutuzumab less than a week before 
this presentation. MRI findings were consistent with PRES, including diffuse 
vasogenic cerebral edema predominately throughout the bilateral parietal and 
occipital lobes associated with some edematous extension into the posterior part 
of bilateral frontal lobes. This case aims to highlight the importance of early 
diagnosis by appropriately identifying the MRI features of PRES to improve 
patient quality of life and decrease morbidity and mortality.

PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of angioid streaks (AS) and 
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), which are rare diseases, using a national claims 
database.
DESIGN: This was a population-based longitudinal cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 126 million individuals were covered by the universal 
health coverage system in Japan.
METHODS: With permission from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, we 
accessed all data from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and 
Specific Health Checkups of Japan, which contains the nationwide health 
insurance claims data for 126 million Japanese. We identified individuals with 
AS and PXE between January 2011 and December 2020. The incidence rates, 
prevalence, overlap of AS and PXE, and mean age at death were calculated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence rates and prevalence of AS and PXE.
RESULTS: A total of 6598 cases of AS and 1020 cases of PXE were identified 
during the 10-year study period. The incidence rates of AS and PXE were 0.52 
(95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.56) and 0.08 (95% confidence interval, 
0.07-0.10) per 100 000 person-years, respectively. On October 1, 2020, the 
prevalence of AS and PXE was 6.5 (95% confidence interval, 6.38-6.66) and 0.83 
(95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.89) per 100 000 persons, respectively. The 
overlap of AS and PXE was 363 patients. The mean age at death of individuals 
with AS and PXE was 79.3 ± 0.51 and 77.1 ± 2.68 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first population-based study to elucidate the 
epidemiology of AS and PXE. The mean age of death of both AS and PXE patients 
was younger than the mean life expectancy of the general Japanese population, 
thus, appropriate diagnosis and management are important to avoid preventable 
death.

BACKGROUND: Fc-fusion proteins have been successfully developed for therapeutic 
purposes, but are also a promising platform for the fast generation and 
purification of immunogens capable of inducing strong humoral immune responses 
in preclinical immunization studies. As the Fc-portion of immunoglobulins fused 
to an antigen confers functional properties of the parental antibody, such as 
dimerization, binding to Fc-receptors and complement activation, several studies 
reported that Fc-fusion proteins elicit stronger antigen-specific antibody 
responses than the unfused antigen. However, dimerization or half-life extension 
of an antigen have also been described to enhance immunogenicity.
METHODS: To explore the role of Fc-effector functions for the immunogenicity of 
fusions proteins of viral glycoproteins and Fc fragments, the HIV-1 gp120 and 
the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were fused to the wild type muIgG2a Fc fragment or mutants 
with impaired (LALA-PG) or improved (GASDIE) Fc-effector functions.
RESULTS: Immunization of BALB/c mice with DNA vaccines encoding gp120 - Fc 
LALA-PG induced significantly higher antigen-specific antibody responses than 
gp120 - Fc WT and GASDIE. In contrast, immunization with DNA vaccines encoding 
the RBD fused to the same Fc mutants, resulted in comparable anti-RBD antibody 
levels and similar neutralization activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants.
CONCLUSION: Depending on the antigen, Fc-effector functions either do not 
modulate or suppress the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines encoding Fc-antigen 
fusion proteins.

Characterizing the nutritional needs of wild bee species is an essential step to 
better understanding bee biology and providing suitable supplemental forage for 
at-risk species. Here, we aim to characterize the nutritional needs of a model 
solitary bee species, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski), by using dietary 
protein-to-lipid ratio (P:L ratio) as a proxy for nutritional niche and niche 
breadth. We first identified the mean target P:L ratio (~3.02:1) and P:L 
collection range (0.75-6.26:1) from pollen provisions collected across a variety 
of sites and time points. We then investigated the P:L tolerance range of larvae 
by rearing bees in vitro on a variety of diets. Multifloral and single-source 
pollen diets with P:L ratios within the range of surveyed provisions did not 
always support larval development, indicating that other dietary components such 
as plant secondary compounds and micronutrients must also be considered in bee 
nutritional experiments. Finally, we used pollen metabarcoding to identify 
pollen from whole larval provisions to understand how much pollen bees used from 
plants outside of their host plant families to meet their nutritional needs, as 
well as pollen from individual forager bouts, to observe if bees maintained 
strict floral constancy or visited multiple plant genera per foraging bout. 
Whole larval provision surveys revealed a surprising range of host plant pollen 
use, ranging from ~5% to 70% of host plant pollen per provision. Samples from 
individual foraging trips contained pollen from multiple genera, suggesting that 
bees are using some form of foraging decision making. Overall, these results 
suggest that O. cornifrons have a wide nutritional niche breadth, but while 
pollen P:L ratio tolerance is broad, a tolerable P:L ratio alone is not enough 
to create a quality diet for O. cornifrons, and the plant species that make up 
these diets must also be carefully considered.

BACKGROUND: In patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) aged > 70 years, 
Dutch and European guidelines recommend different treatment targets: low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) < 2.6 versus < 1.4 mmol/l and systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) < 140 versus < 130 mm Hg, respectively. How this impacts 
cardiovascular event-free life expectancy has not been investigated. The study 
objective was to compare estimated lifelong treatment benefits of implementing 
Dutch and European LDL‑c and SBP targets.
METHODS: Data from patients aged 71-80 years hospitalised for IHD in 2017-2019 
were extracted from the PHARMO Database Network, which links primary and 
secondary healthcare settings, with follow-up until 31 December 2020. Potential 
benefit according to treatment strategy (in gain in event-free years) was 
estimated using the SMART-REACH model.
RESULTS: Of the 3003 eligible patients, 1186 (39%) had missing LDL‑c and/or SBP 
measurements. Of the 1817 included patients (36% women, median age at event: 
74 years (interquartile range (IQR): 72-77), 84% achieved the Dutch targets for 
both LDL‑c and SBP; for European targets, this was 23% and 61%, respectively. If 
Dutch targets were met for LDL‑c and SBP (n = 1281), the additional effect of 
reaching European targets was a median gain of 0.6 event-free life years (IQR: 
0.3-1.0). The greatest effect could be reached in patients not reaching Dutch 
targets (n = 501), with a median gain of 0.6 (IQR: 0.2-1.2) and 1.7 (IQR: 
1.2-2.5) event-free years with Dutch versus European targets.
CONCLUSION: In patients aged > 70 years with IHD, implementation of European 
targets resulted in a greater gain of event-free years compared with Dutch 
targets, especially in patients with poorer risk factor control. The 
considerable number of patients with missing risk factor documentation suggested 
additional opportunities for risk reduction.

IMPORTANCE: Over 580 000 people in the US experience homelessness, with one of 
the largest concentrations residing in San Francisco, California. Unhoused 
individuals have a life expectancy of approximately 50 years, yet how sudden 
death contributes to this early mortality is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare incidence and causes of sudden death by autopsy among 
housed and unhoused individuals in San Francisco County.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the 
Postmortem Systematic Investigation of Sudden Cardiac Death (POST SCD) study, a 
prospective cohort of consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths 
countywide among individuals aged 18 to 90 years. Cases meeting World Health 
Organization criteria for presumed SCD underwent autopsy, toxicologic analysis, 
and medical record review. For rate calculations, all 525 incident SCDs in the 
initial cohort were used (February 1, 2011, to March 1, 2014). For analysis of 
causes, 343 SCDs (incident cases approximately every third day) were added from 
the extended cohort (March 1, 2014, to December 16, 2018). Data analysis was 
performed from July 1, 2022, to July 1, 2023.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were incidence and causes of 
presumed SCD by housing status. Causes of sudden death were adjudicated as 
arrhythmic (potentially rescuable with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), 
cardiac nonarrhythmic (eg, tamponade), or noncardiac (eg, overdose).
RESULTS: A total of 868 presumed SCDs over 8 years were identified: 151 unhoused 
individuals (17.4%) and 717 housed individuals (82.6%). Unhoused individuals 
compared with housed individuals were younger (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [0.8] vs 61.0 
[0.5] years, respectively) and more often male (132 [87.4%] vs 499 [69.6%]), 
with statistically significant racial differences. Paramedic response times were 
similar (mean [SD] time to arrival, unhoused individuals: 5.6 [0.4] minutes; 
housed individuals: 5.6 [0.2] minutes; P = .99), while proportion of witnessed 
sudden deaths was lower among unhoused individuals compared with housed 
individuals (27 [18.0%] vs 184 [25.7%], respectively, P = .04). Unhoused 
individuals had higher rates of sudden death (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 16.2; 
95% CI, 5.1-51.2; P < .001) and arrhythmic death (IRR, 7.2; 95% CI, 1.3-40.1; 
P = .02). These associations remained statistically significant after adjustment 
for differences in age and sex. Noncardiac causes (96 [63.6%] vs 270 [37.7%], 
P < .001), including occult overdose (48 [31.8%] vs 90 [12.6%], P < .001), 
gastrointestinal causes (8 [5.3%] vs 15 [2.1%], P = .03), and infection (11 
[7.3%] vs 20 [2.8%], P = .01), were more common among sudden deaths in unhoused 
individuals. A lower proportion of sudden deaths in unhoused individuals were 
due to arrhythmic causes (48 of 151 [31.8%] vs 420 of 717 [58.6%], P < .001), 
including acute and chronic coronary disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study among individuals who 
experienced sudden death in San Francisco County, homelessness was associated 
with greater risk of sudden death from both noncardiac causes and arrhythmic 
causes potentially preventable with a defibrillator.

BACKGROUND: Patients with bone metastasis often experience a significantly 
limited survival time, and a life expectancy of <3 months is generally regarded 
as a contraindication for extensive invasive surgeries. In this context, the 
accurate prediction of survival becomes very important since it serves as a 
crucial guide in making clinical decisions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based web calculator 
that can provide an accurate assessment of the likelihood of early death among 
patients with bone metastasis.
METHODS: This study analyzed a large cohort of 118,227 patients diagnosed with 
bone metastasis between 2010 and 2019 using the data obtained from a national 
cancer database. The entire cohort of patients was randomly split 9:1 into a 
training group (n=106,492) and a validation group (n=11,735). Six 
approaches-logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting machine, decision 
tree, random forest, neural network, and gradient boosting machine-were 
implemented in this study. The performance of these approaches was evaluated 
using 11 measures, and each approach was ranked based on its performance in each 
measure. Patients (n=332) from a teaching hospital were used as the external 
validation group, and external validation was performed using the optimal model.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort, a substantial proportion of patients 
(43,305/118,227, 36.63%) experienced early death. Among the different approaches 
evaluated, the gradient boosting machine exhibited the highest score of 
prediction performance (54 points), followed by the neural network (52 points) 
and extreme gradient boosting machine (50 points). The gradient boosting machine 
demonstrated a favorable discrimination ability, with an area under the curve of 
0.858 (95% CI 0.851-0.865). In addition, the calibration slope was 1.02, and the 
intercept-in-large value was -0.02, indicating good calibration of the model. 
Patients were divided into 2 risk groups using a threshold of 37% based on the 
gradient boosting machine. Patients in the high-risk group (3105/4315, 71.96%) 
were found to be 4.5 times more likely to experience early death compared with 
those in the low-risk group (1159/7420, 15.62%). External validation of the 
model demonstrated a high area under the curve of 0.847 (95% CI 0.798-0.895), 
indicating its robust performance. The model developed by the gradient boosting 
machine has been deployed on the internet as a calculator.
CONCLUSIONS: This study develops a machine learning-based calculator to assess 
the probability of early death among patients with bone metastasis. The 
calculator has the potential to guide clinical decision-making and improve the 
care of patients with bone metastasis by identifying those at a higher risk of 
early death.

Character-Oriented Design for Visual Data Storytelling.

When telling a data story, an author has an intention they seek to convey to an 
audience. This intention can be of many forms such as to persuade, to educate, 
to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to expressing their intention, the 
story plot must balance being consumable and enjoyable while preserving 
scientific integrity. In data stories, numerous methods have been identified for 
constructing and presenting a plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand 
how we think and create the visual elements that present the story. Stories are 
brought to life by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, 
enjoyable, memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through 
the analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and 
identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we 
illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of "character-oriented 
design". We identify the roles and visual representations data characters assume 
as well as the types of relationships these roles have with one another. We 
identify characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data 
stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the 
audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify their 
visual representations. We then illustrate "character-oriented design" by 
showing how to develop data characters with common data story plots. With this 
work, we present a framework for data characters derived from our analysis; we 
then offer our extension to the data storytelling process using 
character-oriented design. To access our supplemental materials please visit

INTRODUCTION: population aging is a worldwide demographic phenomenon of the last 
thirty years. This increase in life expectancy leads to an increase in the 
incidence of degenerative diseases, mainly gonarthrosis. According to World 
Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 10% of the population over 60 years of age 
suffers from osteoarthrosis, and 40% of the population over 70 years of age 
suffers from gonarthrosis, figures that could increase in the next decade. 
Approximately 80% of people over 65 years of age present radiographic changes 
with evidence of gonarthrosis, being 10-25% of the reason for medical visits at 
the first level of care. Treatment with intra-articular platelet rich plasma has 
proven to be an effective therapeutic alternative.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective, quasi-experimental, non-randomized study 
was carried out to compare the behavior of grade I and II gonarthrosis in 140 
patients diagnosed clinically and radiologically. Separated into two groups of 
patients, the first group treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) and the second group treated with intra-articular infiltration with 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The same was carried out in the Specialties Clinic 
No. 3 of the Cuauhtémoc Health Jurisdiction, in the orthopedics office during 
the year 2020. Descriptive statistics were analyzed through the elaboration of a 
frequency table that allowed us to calculate the mean and standard deviation, 
and inferential statistics were analyzed through the 2 test.
RESULTS: the age group most affected by gonarthrosis is 60 to 69 years of age 
with 43.5% of the total number of patients, being the female sex the most 
affected with 33.5%. Most of the patients had a body mass index that placed them 
as overweight and obese with 39 and 53% respectively. Pain evolved towards 
improvement in 92% of patients treated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and in 
25.7% of patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The 
functional capacity of the knee joint recovered in 97% of the patients treated 
with PRP and in 35.7% of those treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: treatment of grade I and II gonarthrosis with intra-articular 
platelet-rich plasma is more effective than treatment with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: el envejecimiento poblacional es un fenómeno 
demográfico a nivel mundial de los últimos 30 años. Dicho aumento de la 
expectativa de vida conlleva a un incremento en la incidencia de enfermedades 
degenerativas, principalmente de gonartrosis. Según cálculos de la Organización 
Mundial de la Salud (OMS), se estima que 10% de la población mayor de 60 años 
padece de osteoartrosis, 40% de la población mayor de 70 años presenta 
gonartrosis, cifras que podrían aumentar en la siguiente década. Aproximadamente 
80% de las personas mayores de 65 años presentan cambios radiográficos con 
evidencia de gonartrosis, siendo 10-25% del motivo de visita médica en el primer 
nivel de atención. El tratamiento con plasma rico en plaquetas intraarticular ha 
demostrado ser una alternativa terapéutica eficaz.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: se realizó un estudio prospectivo, cuasiexperimental, no 
aleatorizado donde se comparó el comportamiento de la gonartrosis grado I y II 
en 140 pacientes diagnosticados clínica y radiológicamente. Separados en dos 
grupos de pacientes: primer grupo tratado con antiinflamatorios no esteroideos 
(AINEs) y el segundo grupo tratado con infiltración intraarticular con plasma 
rico en plaquetas (PRP). El mismo se llevó a cabo en la Clínica de 
Especialidades No. 3 de la Jurisdicción Sanitaria Cuauhtémoc, en la consulta de 
ortopedia durante el año 2020. La estadística descriptiva se analizó a partir de 
la elaboración de una tabla de frecuencias que permitió calcular la media y la 
desviación estándar, de igual manera la estadística inferencial se analizó a 
través de la 2.
RESULTADOS: el grupo de edad más afectado por gonartrosis es el de 60 a 69 años 
de edad con 43.5% del total de pacientes, siendo el sexo femenino el más 
afectado con 33.5%. La mayoría de los pacientes presentaron índice de masa 
corporal que los ubicaba como sobrepeso y obesos con 39 y 53%, respectivamente. 
El dolor evolucionó hacia una mejoría en 92% de los pacientes tratados con 
plasma rico en plaquetas y en 25.7% de los pacientes tratados con 
antiinflamatorios no esteroideos. La capacidad funcional de la articulación de 
la rodilla se recuperó en 97% de los pacientes tratados con plasma rico en 
plaquetas y en 35.7% de los tratados con antiinflamatorios no esteroideos.
CONCLUSIONES: el tratamiento de la gonartrosis grado I y II con plasma rico en 
plaquetas intraarticular es más efectivo que el tratamiento con 
antiinflamatorios no esteroideos.

[Early-onset scoliosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment].

[Article in Spanish; Abstract available in Spanish from the publisher]

Sauri-Barraza JC(1).

Early-onset scoliosis corresponds to a group of heterogeneous spinal conditions 
that present before 10 years of age with a curvature in the coronal plane of 10° 
or more. Regardless of the etiology, adequate control of the deformity is 
required to avoid cardiopulmonary deterioration and preserve quality and life 
expectancy. Diagnosis can be difficult and is usually incidental at a young age. 
To choose the best treatment, it is important to consider the patient's age, 
etiology, and rate of progression. Among the non-operative treatments, the most 
effective are the use of serial casts or brace, whose main objective is to stop 
the progression of the deformity and thus delay surgical treatment. Among the 
surgical treatments the distraction based systems and definitive arthrodesis 
have proven to be most effective. Early surgery leads to multiple complications, 
which is why, if feasible, non surgical management should be sought and fusion 
postponed till skeletal maturity. Due to the life-threatening risks associated 
with the deformity and treatment, it is important to educate the patient and 
family members about the importance of treatment adherence and follow-up.

Publisher: La escoliosis de inicio temprano corresponde a un grupo heterogéneo 
de padecimientos de la columna, la cual se presenta antes de los 10 años de edad 
con una curvatura en el plano coronal de 10° o más. Independientemente de la 
etiología requiere un adecuado control de la deformidad para evitar deterioro 
cardiopulmonar, disminución en la calidad y expectativa de vida. El diagnóstico 
puede ser difícil y habitualmente se da de forma incidental. Para el 
tratamiento, es importante considerar la edad del paciente, la etiología y la 
velocidad de progresión. Dentro de los tratamientos conservadores, se encuentra 
el uso de yesos seriados o el corsé, cuyo objetivo principal es detener la 
progresión de la deformidad y con ello retrasar la cirugía a una edad mayor. 
Dentro de los tratamientos quirúrgicos se encuentran el uso de barras de 
crecimiento tradicionales, las barras de crecimiento magnéticas y la artrodesis 
definitiva. Se ha observado que realizarlos de forma temprana condiciona 
múltiples complicaciones por lo cual, de ser posible, debe optarse por el manejo 
no quirúrgico y postergar el tratamiento definitivo. Debido a los riesgos 
potencialmente mortales que conlleva la deformidad y el tratamiento, es de 
importancia educar al paciente y sus familiares sobre la importancia del apego y 
el seguimiento.

Hypoxia exposure may promote neuroprotection for people with Parkinson's disease 
(PwPD). However, to implement hypoxia in practical settings and direct future 
research, it is necessary to organize the current knowledge about hypoxia 
responses/effects in PwPD. Thus, the present scoping review elucidates the 
evidence about hypoxia exposure applied to PwPD. Following the PRISMA Extension 
for Scoping Reviews, papers were searched in PubMed/NCBI, Web of Science, and 
Scopus (descriptors: Parkinson and hypoxia, mountain, or altitude). We included 
original articles published in English until August 12, 2023. Eight studies 
enrolled participants with early to moderate stages of disease. Acute responses 
demonstrated that PwPD exposed to normobaric hypoxia presented lower hypoxia 
ventilatory responses (HVR), perceptions of dyspnea, and sympathetic 
activations. Cumulative exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (living high; 7 days; 
altitude not reported) induced positive effects on motor symptoms (hypokinesia) 
and perceptions of PwPD (quality of life and living with illness). Normobaric 
hypoxia (isocapnic rebreathe, 14 days, three times/day of 5-7 min at 8-10 % of 
O2) improved HVR. The included studies reported no harmful effects. Although 
these results demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of hypoxia exposure 
applied to PwPD, we also discuss the methodological limitations of the selected 
experimental design (no randomized controlled trials), the characterization of 
the hypoxia doses, and the range of symptoms investigated. Thus, despite the 
safety of both normobaric hypoxia and hypobaric hypoxia for early to moderate 
levels of disease, the current literature is still incipient, limiting the use 
of hypoxia exposure in practical settings.

Oomycetes are heterotrophic protists that share phenotypic similarities with 
fungi, including the ability to cause plant diseases, but branch in a separate 
and distant region of the eukaryotic tree of life. It has been suggested that 
multiple horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) from fungi-to-oomycetes contributed to 
the evolution of plant-pathogenic traits. These HGTs are predicted to include 
secreted proteins that degrade plant cell walls. This is a key trait in the 
pathology of many oomycetes, as the plant cell wall represents a primary barrier 
to pathogen invasion and a rich source of carbohydrates. Many of the HGT gene 
families identified have undergone multiple rounds of duplication. Using a 
combination of phylogenomic analysis and functional assays, we investigate the 
diversification of a horizontally-transferred xyloglucanase gene family in the 
model oomycete species Phytophthora sojae. Our analyses detect 11 genes retained 
in P. sojae among a complex pattern of gene duplications and losses. Using a 
phenotype assay, based on heterologous expression in yeast, we show that eight 
of these paralogs have xyloglucanase function, including variants with distinct 
protein characteristics, such as a long-disordered C-terminal extension that can 
increase xyloglucanase activity. The functional xyloglucanase variants analysed 
subtend an ancestral node close to the fungi-oomycetes gene transfer, suggesting 
the horizontally-transferred gene was a bona fide xyloglucanase. Expression of 
xyloglucanase paralogs in Nicotiana benthamiana triggers distinct patterns of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, demonstrating that enzyme variants 
differentially stimulate pattern-triggered immunity in plants. Mass spectrometry 
of detectable enzymatic products demonstrates that some paralogs catalyze 
production of variant breakdown profiles, suggesting that secretion of multiple 
xyloglucanase variants increases efficiency of xyloglucan breakdown, as well as 
potentially diversifying the range of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns 
(DAMPs) released during pathogen attack. We suggest that such patterns of 
protein neofunctionalization, and variant host responses, represent an aspect of 
the Red Queen host-pathogen co-evolutionary dynamic.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The oomycetes are a diverse group of eukaryotic microbes 
that include some of the most devastating pathogens of plants. Oomycetes 
perceive, invade, and colonize plants in similar ways to fungi, in part because 
they acquired the genes to attack and feed on plants from fungi. These genes are 
predicted to be useful to oomycete plant pathogens because they have undergone 
multiple rounds of gene duplication. One key enzyme for attacking plant cell 
wall structures is called xyloglucanase. Xyloglucanase in the oomycetes has 
undergone multiple rounds of gene duplication, leading to variants including an 
enzyme with a C-terminal extension that increases activity. Some xyloglucanase 
variants trigger unique patterns of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in planta, and 
generate different profiles of cell wall breakdown products - such outcomes 
could act to mystify and increase the workload of the plant immune system, 
allowing successful pathogens to proliferate.

BACKGROUND: Many children today are growing up in environments that predispose 
them to develop noncommunicable diseases. While no single preventive solution 
exists, evidence supports interventions in childcare settings for establishing 
good nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a "critical window" that could 
reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases later in life. Emerging 
eHealth tools have shown potential in promoting best practices for nutrition and 
physical activity environments in early childhood education and care (ECEC) 
settings.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review is to map the breadth of 
available evidence on eHealth tools currently available to assess and support 
best practices for nutrition, physical activity, or both in ECEC settings and to 
highlight potential research directions.
METHODS: This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna 
Briggs Institute Manual for Scoping Reviews with adherence to the PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension 
for Scoping Reviews) checklist guidelines. Eligibility is based on the 
Population, Concept, and Context criteria as follows: (1) early childhood 
educators (population); (2) eHealth (digital) technology, such as websites, 
smartphone apps, email, and social media (concept); and (3) measurement and 
intervention tools to support best practices for nutrition, physical activity, 
or both in ECEC settings (context). The information sources for this review are 
the bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, ERIC, and Embase in 
English and French with no date restrictions. Following this, a scan of gray 
literature will be undertaken. The electronic search strategy was developed in 
collaboration with two librarians. Two independent reviewers will screen the 
titles and abstracts of all relevant publications against inclusion criteria, 
followed by a full-text review using a data extraction tool developed by the 
reviewers. A synthesis of included papers will describe the publication, 
assessment, and intervention tool details. A summary of the findings will 
describe the types of eHealth assessment tools available, psychometric 
properties, eHealth intervention components, and theoretical frameworks used for 
development.
RESULTS: Preliminary searches of bibliographic databases to test and calibrate 
the search were carried out in May 2023. Study selection based on titles and 
abstracts was started in August 2023. The developed search strategy will guide 
our search for gray literature. The findings will be presented in visualized 
data map format, waffle chart, or tabular format accompanied by a narrative 
discussion. The scoping review is planned for completion in 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: A structured review of the literature will provide a summary of the 
range and type of eHealth tools available for ECEC programs to assess and 
improve nutrition environments, physical activity environments, or both in order 
to identify gaps in the current evidence base and provide insights to guide 
future intervention research.

Report on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health and diseases in Hunan 
Province, 2020.

[Article in Chinese, English; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Hunan Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Health and Disease Report Compilation 
Group.

Being the leading cause of death among both urban and rural residents in Hunan 
Province, China, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases hold a significant 
position in the region's public health landscape. Their prevalence and impact 
not only underscore the urgency of effective disease prevention and control but 
also provide crucial guidance for future initiatives. Consequently, the Hunan 
Province Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Health and Disease Report Summary 
(2020) hereinafter referred to as the "Annual Report", serves as an extensive 
and informative document. It meticulously examines the current status of these 
diseases, highlighting both the existing challenges and opportunities for 
prevention and control efforts in Hunan Province. The primary objective of this 
report is to furnish valuable insights and evidence that will empower and enrich 
future endeavors aimed at combatting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases 
within the region. In 2017, the year of life expectancy lost due to 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Hunan Province remained higher 
than the national average. Additionally, the per capita life expectancy in 2019 
(77.1 years) was slightly lower by 0.2 years compared with the national average 
(77.3 years). Alarmingly, the mortality rates associated with cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases were consistently ranking highest, indicating an upward 
trajectory. Moreover, the prevalence and mortality rates of conditions such as 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke, all encompassed within the 
domain of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, surpassed the national 
averages. Consequently, the economic burden attributable to cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases is on the rise. And under vertical comparison, in 2019, 
the life expectancy per capita in Hunan Province increased by 1.26 years 
compared with 2015. The incidence rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
events decreased by 8.34% compared with 2017. A new model of hypertension 
medical and preventive integration has been established with the efforts of many 
experts in Hunan Province, and full coverage of standardised outpatient clinics 
for hypertension at the grassroots level has been realised. The rate of 
standardised management of patients with hypertension under management in 
Changsha County, a demonstration area, rose to 65.27%, and the incidence rate of 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, the incidence rate of stroke, and the 
mortality rate due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were reduced by 
28.08%, 28.62%, and 25.00%, respectively. Hunan Province has made significant 
strides in the prevention and control of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases in recent years.

OBJECTIVES: Stroke has become the leading cause of death and disability among 
adults in China. This study aims to analyze the disease burden based on gender 
and age and the risk factors for stroke subtypes in China 2019, and to provide 
reference for targeted stroke prevention and control.
METHODS: Based on 2019 data of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), the gender 
and age in patients with different stroke subtypes (ischemic stroke, 
intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage) in China 2019 was described by 
using disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and attributable burden of related 
risk factors was analyzed.
RESULTS: In 2019, the burden of intracranial hemorrhage was the heaviest one in 
China, resulting in 22.210 6 million person years of DALY, following by ischemic 
stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, resulting in 21.393 9 and 2.344 7 million 
person years of DALY, respectively. Among them, except the 0-14 age group, the 
disease burden of different subtypes of stroke in men was higher than that in 
women. The disease burden of ischemic stroke was increased with age in both men 
and women, with the heaviest disease burden in ≥70 years group. The disease 
burden of intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage was the heaviest 
in males aged 50-69 years old, and in females aged ≥70 years and 50-69 years, 
respectively. Metabolic factors were the main risk factors in all ages of 
different stroke subtypes, and the most important risk factor was high systolic 
blood pressure. Other risk factors were different between men and women. 
Smoking, high body mass index, high low-density lipoprotein, and outdoor 
particulate matter pollution were the main risk factors for stroke in men, while 
high body mass index, outdoor particulate matter pollution, and high fasting 
blood glucose were the main risk factors of stroke in women. The main risk were 
different among different age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden and attributable risk factors for different stroke 
subtypes are discrepancy in different gender and age groups. Targeted 
interventions should be conducted in the future to reduce the burden of stroke.
