University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Hazardous waste sites are major environmental concerns, but few 
studies have quantified their expected utility loss on health.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health impact of groundwater pollution by an 
electronics manufacturing factory, we conducted a health risk assessment based 
on expected utility loss from liver cancer.
METHODS: Based on measurements of major pollutants, we estimated the likelihood 
of developing liver cancer after exposure to groundwater contamination. All 
patients with liver cancer between 1990 and 2005 in the Taiwan Cancer Registry 
were followed through 2007 using the National Mortality Registry to obtain 
survival function. Quality of life was assessed with two cross-sectional 
surveys, one employing the standard gamble method, and the other using the EQ-5D 
instrument. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was estimated by multiplying 
the utility values with survival function under the unit of quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY). The difference of QALE between the cancer cohort and the age- 
and gender-matched reference population was calculated to represent the utility 
loss due to liver cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 94,144 patients with liver cancer were identified. The 
average utility loss to development of liver cancer was 17.5 QALYs. Based on 
toxicological approach, we estimated that groundwater pollution caused 1.7 extra 
cases of liver cancer, with an overall loss of 29.8 QALYs. Based on 
epidemiological approach, the expected annual excess number of liver cancer 
would be 3.65, which would have been accumulated through the years, had the 
pollution not mitigated.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a practical approach for comparative health risk 
assessment using QALY as the common unit. This approach can be used for policy 
decisions based on possible health risks.

People with higher fitness and higher aerobic capacity have longer life 
expectancies compared to inactive people. Longer and better life can result from 
some genetic factors, as well as from higher physical capacities acquired during 
younger years. However, there are several studies proving the definitive role of 
life-long physical activity, too, which can be engaged in at any age. Even at 
very old ages, regular physical activity results in a lot of benefits, in high 
quality of life, in independence and longevity.

and quality of life in intermediate-frail and frail elderly men: a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

CONTEXT: Physical frailty is associated with reduced muscle strength, impaired 
physical function, and quality of life. Testosterone (T) increases muscle mass 
and strength in hypogonadal patients. It is unclear whether T has similar 
effects in intermediate-frail and frail elderly men with low to borderline-low 
T.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects of 6 months T treatment in 
intermediate-frail and frail elderly men, on muscle mass and strength, physical 
function, and quality of life.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, single-center study.
PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS were community-dwelling intermediate-frail and frail 
elderly men at least 65 yr of age with a total T at or below 12 nmol/liter or 
free T at or below 250 pmol/liter.
METHODS: Two hundred seventy-four participants were randomized to transdermal T 
(50 mg/d) or placebo gel for 6 months. Outcome measures included muscle 
strength, lean and fat mass, physical function, and self-reported quality of 
life.
RESULTS: Isometric knee extension peak torque improved in the T group (vs. 
placebo at 6 months), adjusted difference was 8.6 (95% confidence interval, 
1.3-16.0; P = 0.02) Newton-meters. Lean body mass increased and fat mass 
decreased significantly in the T group by 1.08 +/- 1.8 and 0.9 +/- 1.6 kg, 
respectively. Physical function improved among older and frailer men. Somatic 
and sexual symptom scores decreased with T treatment; adjusted difference was 
-1.2 (-2.4 to -0.04) and -1.3 (-2.5 to -0.2), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: T treatment in intermediate-frail and frail elderly men with low to 
borderline-low T for 6 months may prevent age-associated loss of lower limb 
muscle strength and improve body composition, quality of life, and physical 
function. Further investigations are warranted to extend these results.

CONTEXT: Necrotizing fasciitis is an aggressive infection affecting the skin and 
soft tissue. It has a very high acute mortality. The long-term survival and 
cause of death of patients who survive an index hospitalization for necrotizing 
fasciitis are not known.
OBJECTIVE: To define the long-term survival of patients who survive an index 
admission for necrotizing fasciitis. We hypothesize that survivors will have a 
shorter life span than population controls.
DESIGN: Long-term follow-up of a registry of patients from 1989 to 2006 who 
survived a hospitalization for necrotizing fasciitis. Last date of follow-up was 
January 1, 2008.
SETTINGS: A university-based Burn and Trauma Center.
PATIENTS: A prospective registry of patients with necrotizing fasciitis has been 
collected from 1989 to 2006. This registry was linked to data from the 
Department of Health, Department of Motor Vehicles, and the University Hospital 
Medical Records Department in January 2008 to obtain follow-up and vital status 
data.
INTERVENTION: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Date and cause of death were abstracted from death 
certificates. Date of last live follow-up was determined from the medical record 
and by the last driver's license renewal. The death rate of the cohort was 
standardized for age and sex against 2005 statewide mortality rates. Cause of 
death was collated into infectious and noninfectious and compared with the 
statewide causes of death. Statistical analysis included standardized mortality 
rates, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Aalen's additive hazard model.
RESULTS: Three hundred forty-five patients of the 377 in the registry survived 
at least 30 days and were analyzed. Average age at presentation was 49 years 
(range, 1-86; median, 49). Patients were followed up an average of 3.3 years 
(range, 0.0-15.7; median, 2.4). Eighty-seven of these patients died (25%). 
Median survival was 10.0 years (95% confidence interval: 7.25-13.11). There was 
a trend toward higher mortality in women. Twelve of the 87 deaths were due to 
infectious causes. Using three different statistical analytic techniques, there 
was a statistically significant increase in the long-term death rate when 
compared with population-based controls. Infectious causes of death were 
statistically higher than controls as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who survive an episode of necrotizing fasciitis are at 
continued risk for premature death; many of these deaths were due to infectious 
causes such as pneumonia, cholecystitis, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. 
These patients should be counseled, followed, and immunized to minimize chances 
of death. Modification of other risk factors for death such as obesity, 
diabetes, smoking, and atherosclerotic disease should also be undertaken. The 
sex difference in long-term survival is intriguing and needs to be addressed in 
further studies.

OBJECTIVE: Natural menopause is a key physiological event in a woman's life. 
Timing of menopause affects risk for many postmenopausal systemic disorders and 
may thus influence life expectancy. Age at natural menopause (ANM) is largely 
determined genetically, but a list of candidate genes is far from complete. This 
study investigated the ALOX12 gene for its possible association with ANM.
METHODS: Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene (rs9904779, 
rs2073438, rs11571340, rs434473, rs2307214, and rs312462) were genotyped in a 
random sample of 210 unrelated white women. The SNPs and common haplotypes were 
then analyzed for their association with ANM. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and 
duration of breast-feeding were used as covariates.
RESULTS: Two SNPs, rs9904779 and rs434473 (encodes a replacement of asparagine 
by serine in the protein), were significantly associated with ANM (P = 0.022 and 
0.033, respectively). The minor alleles of both SNPs seem to promote about 1.3- 
to 1.5-year earlier menopause and confer a 1.6 to 1.8 times higher risk for 
early menopause. All SNPs indicated significant or nearly significant 
interactions with alcohol use and duration of breast-feeding. Five common 
haplotypes were also associated with ANM.
CONCLUSIONS: The ALOX12 gene seems to be associated with the timing of natural 
menopause in white women.

Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom.

INTRODUCTION: With the worldwide shortage of donors, extra lengths are ongoing 
to enlarge the donor pool. One means has been a greater use of "expanded 
criteria donor" (ECD) grafts. A major concern regarding ECD kidneys is poor 
long-term graft survival. The aims of this study were to determine whether ECD 
grafts, as defined by the United Network for Organ Sharing, had a negative 
impact on graft survival and to identify the principle donor and recipient 
factors that influenced graft survival in our patient cohort.
METHODS: We analyzed all deceased donor renal transplants in our unit from 
January 1995 to October 2005, in total 1,053 transplants.
RESULTS: ECD grafts (United Network for Organ Sharing criteria) demonstrated 
higher rates of delayed graft function and higher early mean creatinine levels. 
However, there was no significant difference in 5-year graft survival. 
Multivariate analysis of our patient group identified donor hypertension and 
ischemic heart disease (IHD) as independent predictors of poor graft survival. 
Recipient age was significant on univariate but not on multivariate analysis. 
However, although younger recipients maintained acceptable 5-year graft survival 
despite donor hypertension, IHD, or a combination of both, these factors 
significantly reduced graft survival in older recipients.
CONCLUSION: Although ECD grafts had slightly worse function, 5-year survival was 
comparable with standard grafts in all recipients. Donor hypertension, IHD, or a 
combination of both significantly reduced graft survival in older recipients, 
not evident in younger patients. We discuss the possible factors for improved 
outcome with ECD grafts in our patients and the implications of our patient 
analysis.

Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality 
in developed countries, the usefulness of preventive low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) after cesarean delivery remains a matter of controversy. It was 
the objective of this study to evaluate the usefulness of thromboprophylaxis 
with LMWH after cesarean delivery. A decision model was constructed to evaluate 
the risks and benefits associated with a seven-day LMWH prophylaxis, compared 
with none. All probabilities were obtained from literature according to the 
highest level of evidence. We performed our analysis on two different sets of 
outcomes (utilities and disutilities), to calculate the quality-adjusted life 
expectancy at three months. Finally, we calculated the outcomes for four 
hypothetical cases with different risk. Prophylaxis with LMWH yielded the 
highest quality-adjusted life expectancy, with a net gain of 1.5-2.8 
quality-adjusted days. Sensitivity analyses showed the incidence of VTE after 
cesarean delivery and the haemorrhagic risk related to LMWH to be critical, at 
threshold values of 0.15-0.22% and 0.23-0.35%, respectively. In the hypothetical 
cases, LMWH was safe but only marginally more effective in women with no risk 
factors. In case of an emergency procedure, a body-mass index >25kg/m(2), 
tobacco smoking, or any combination of these, reductions in VTE greatly 
outnumbered the increase in major haemorrhages, with a modest benefit on 
mortality. Our decision analysis suggests that the benefits of LMWH after 
cesarean delivery exceed the risks. This benefit is, however, very low in women 
with no risk factors.

Cancer prevention and control in the Eastern Mediterranean region: the need for 
a public health approach.

Khatib O(1), Aljurf M.

Region, Cairo, Egypt.

Cancer is increasingly recognized as a major health concern in the Eastern 
Mediterranean (EM) region. The emergence of cancer and other non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) in most EM region countries is related to increases in life 
expectancy, an increasing proportion of elderly people, and the successful 
control of most childhood communicable diseases, along with rapid strides in 
socioeconomic development. In the next 15 years, cancer incidence in the EM is 
expected to increase by 100% to 180%, according to World Health Organization 
(WHO) projection modelling, the largest increase foreseen among developing 
countries. Even though 30% of cancers can be prevented and controlled using 
available knowledge, death rates will increase by 17% by 2015 because of the 
challenges and barriers to implementing national strategic action plans. Other 
problems facing countries in the region are the lack of national cancer 
surveillance and little harmonization in monitoring and surveillance 
methodologies. Data on cancer mortality in the 21 countries is limited or 
lacking, with only 7 countries having national population-based registries. 
There is no linking of cancer mortality data to NCD prevention and control. A 
model of integrated care for NCD prevention programs in general and cancer in 
particular is lacking, and finally, there is inadequate national 
capacity-building and a lack of program sustainability. The WHO Regional 
Committee for the EM has adopted a resolution recognizing the considerable 
magnitude of cancer as a major cause of morbidity, human suffering, and 
mortality in the region. In the last 15 years, the WHO Cancer Control Programme 
has fostered the development of national cancer control programs as a primary 
intervention strategy for a comprehensive and cost-effective approach at the 
country level.

Breast cancer is the principle cancer among female cancer in Tunisia. It 
represents 30% of the woman's cancers with about 1000 new cases per year. The 
main intervention control is mass screening using mammography in to reduce 
breast cancer mortality. Breast cancer screening efficacy in term of breast 
cancer mortality reduction is closely related to incidence and survival of this 
cancer. National Office of Family and Population (ONFP) conducted a pilot 
experience of breast cancer mass screening using the mammography in place. The 
main objective of this study is to calculate the potential number of life years 
saved through this pilot experience of the ONFP. For the methodology, we used 
the software Dismod (Disease Model) for the evaluation of the prevalence and the 
duration of the cancer of the breast in the governorate, as well as to estimate 
the number of life years saved. The potential breast cancer mortality reduction 
is 30% for women aged of 50 at 69 years, and 10% for those aged of 40 at 49 
years. Breast cancer incidence in Ariana according to age for the period 
1995-1998, has been calculated from the data base of cancer registry of the 
North of Tunisia. According to Dismod, mean duration in the absence of 
screening, is 11.12 years for the age group 40 to 49 years and 9.57 for the age 
group 50 at 69 years. Screening would increase these duration means of 2.22 
years and 1.71 years, respectively for age groups 40 to 49 years and 50 at 69 
years. The number of life years saved for 1000 women is of 2.97 years. In 
conclusion breast cancer screening using mammography would be actually little 
benefit in Tunisia. Mammography should be reserved for the diagnosis of the 
suspected cases and screening for high risk women.

Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for prevention of 
cervical cancer in Taiwan.

Liu PH(1), Hu FC, Lee PI, Chow SN, Huang CW, Wang JD.

Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been shown to be a major 
risk factor for cervical cancer. Vaccines against HPV-16 and HPV-18 are highly 
effective in preventing type-specific HPV infections and related cervical 
lesions. There is, however, limited data available describing the health and 
economic impacts of HPV vaccination in Taiwan. The objective of this study was 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic HPV vaccination for the 
prevention of cervical cancer in Taiwan.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the health and economic outcomes 
of vaccinating preadolescent girls (at the age of 12 years) for the prevention 
of cervical cancer with current practice, including cervical cytological 
screening. Data were synthesized from published papers or reports, and whenever 
possible, those specific to Taiwan were used. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to account for important uncertainties and different vaccination 
scenarios.
RESULTS: Under the assumption that the HPV vaccine could provide lifelong 
protection, the massive vaccination among preadolescent girls in Taiwan would 
lead to reduction in 73.3% of the total incident cervical cancer cases and would 
result in a life expectancy gain of 4.9 days or 8.7 quality-adjusted life days 
at a cost of US$324 as compared to the current practice. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$23,939 per life year gained or US$13,674 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained given the discount rate of 3%. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that this ICER would remain below US$30,000 per QALY 
under most conditions, even when vaccine efficacy was suboptimal or when 
vaccine-induced immunity required booster shots every 13 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Although gains in life expectancy may be modest at the individual 
level, the results indicate that prophylactic HPV vaccination of preadolescent 
girls in Taiwan would result in substantial population benefits with a favorable 
cost-effectiveness ratio. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the urgency to 
improve the compliance rate of cervical screening, particularly for older 
individuals.

Calorie restriction (CR) is a regimen of reduced food intake that, although the 
underlying mechanism is unknown, in many organisms leads to life span extension. 
Podospora anserina is one of the few known ageing filamentous fungi and the 
ageing process and concomitant degeneration of mitochondria have been 
well-studied. CR in P. anserina increases not only life span but also forestalls 
the ageing-related decline in fertility. Here we review what is known about CR 
in P. anserina and about possibly involved mechanisms like enhanced 
mitochondrial stability, reduced production of reactive oxygen species and 
changes in the OXPHOS machinery. Additionally, we present new microscopic data 
on mitochondrial dynamics under rich nutritional and CR conditions at different 
points in life. Lines that have grown under severe CR for more than 50x the 
normal life span, show no accumulation of age-related damage, though fecundity 
is reduced in some of these lines. Finally, we discuss the possible role of CR 
in P. anserina in nature and the effect of CR at different points in life.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of the Chlamydia Monday--a community-based 
intervention to decrease the prevalence of chlamydia in Sweden.

AIMS: The study was undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Chlamydia 
Monday, 2007. This is a community-based intervention aimed at reducing the 
prevalence of chlamydia by information and increased availability of testing, 
treatment and contact tracing in Stockholm. The aim was to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness by estimating costs, savings and effects on health associated 
with the intervention, and to determine if cost-effectiveness varies between men 
and women.
METHODS: A societal perspective was adopted, meaning all significant costs and 
consequences were taken into consideration, regardless of who experienced them. 
A cost-effectiveness model was constructed including costs of the intervention, 
savings due to avoiding potential costs associated with medical sequels of 
chlamydia infection, and health gains measured as quality adjusted life years 
(QALY). Sensitivity analyses were done to explore model and result uncertainty.
RESULTS: Total costs were calculated to be 66,787.21; total savings to 
30,370.14; and total health gains to 9.852324 QALYs (undiscounted figures). The 
discounted cost per QALY was 8,346.05 (10,810.77/QALY for women and 
6,085.35/QALY for men). Sensitivity analyses included changes in effectiveness, 
variation of prevalence, reduced risk of sequel progression, inclusion of 
prevented future production loss and shortened duration for chronic conditions. 
The cost per QALY was consistently less than 50,000, which is often regarded as 
cost-effective in a Swedish context.
CONCLUSIONS: The Chlamydia Monday has been demonstrated by this study to be a 
cost-effective intervention and should be considered a wise use of society's 
resources.

PURPOSE Hematopoietic cell transplantation can cure hematologic malignancies and 
other diseases, but this treatment can also cause late complications. Previous 
studies have evaluated the cumulative effects of late complications on survival, 
but longer-term effects on life expectancy after hematopoietic cell 
transplantation have not been assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS We used standard 
methods to evaluate mortality, projected life expectancy, and causes of death in 
a cohort of 2,574 patients who survived without recurrence of the original 
disease for at least 5 years after allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplantation from 1970 through 2002. Sex- and age-specific comparisons were 
made with US population data. Results Estimated survival of the cohort at 20 
years after transplantation was 80.4% (95% CI, 78.1% to 82.6%). During 22,923 
person-years of follow-up, 357 deaths occurred. Mortality rates remained four- 
to nine-fold higher than the expected population rate for at least 30 years 
after transplantation, yielding an estimated 30% lower life expectancy compared 
with that in the general population, regardless of current age. In rank order, 
the leading causes of excess deaths were second malignancies and recurrent 
disease, followed by infections, chronic graft-versus-host disease, respiratory 
diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION Patients who have survived for 
at least 5 years after hematopoietic cell transplantation without recurrence of 
the original disease have a high probability of surviving for an additional 15 
years, but life expectancy is not fully restored. Further effort is needed to 
reduce the burden of disease and treatment-related complications in this 
population.

Malignant lower-limb metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone tumours that have not yet 
invaded the epiphysis can usually be managed with limb-sparing surgery. 
Reconstructions using intercalary allografts, autoclaved autografts, 
extracorporeally irradiated autografts, vascularised autografts, and distraction 
osteogenesis have all achieved favourable results. In patients with metastatic 
disease and a short life expectancy, reconstruction with allografts or 
autografts should be carefully considered because a long recovery period is 
needed. An intercalary endoprosthesis provides immediate stability, a short 
recovery period and a low implant failure rate. Nonetheless, it may be expensive 
when there is inadequate space for stem insertion, necessitating a custom-made 
endoprosthesis. We present a 12-year-old boy with stage-III osteosarcoma of the 
metaphysis and diaphysis of the femur who underwent knee joint salvage and 
reconstruction with a retrograde, locked, intramedullary nail surrounded with 
methylmethacrylate. At the one-month follow-up, the patient could walk 
unassisted. At the 2-year follow-up, his Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 
83%. The patient died from lung metastases at 31 months. He had not experienced 
any complications with the reconstruction.

[Autonomic nervous dysfunction in insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetic men.].

[Article in Icelandic]

Olafsson G, Danielsen R, Hreidarsson AB.

The development of autonomic nervous dysfunction (AND) in subjects with diabetes 
influences life expectancy and may cause sudden death. The present study 
evaluates disturbances of AND in 41 men with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but 
without heart symptoms, and the relationship with other long term diabetic 
complications and blood sugar control. Their age ranged 18-50 years (mean 34 
+/-8 years) and the duration of diabetes 1-43 years (mean 13 +/-10 years). A 
control group consisted of 18 healthy men of similar age. Heart rate and blood 
pressure responses during standard autonomic tests were assessed by a computer 
program, vibration sensibility by a Biothesiometer, and an exercise test was 
performed. AND was more frequent in diabetics than controls (39% versus 6%, 
p<0.01), and increased with the duration of diabetes (r=0.34, p<0.05), but not 
significantly with HbAl-levels (r=0.21, p=0.19). Diabetics with AND had an 
earlier onset p<0.05) and a longer duration of (p<0.01) diabetes, decreased 
vibration sense (p<0.05), more frequent hypoglycaemic episodes (p<0.05), 
intermittent claudication (p<0.01), a higher resting heart rate (p<0.05), and a 
shorter treadmill time (p<0.05). Consequently, at maximal exercise their 
systolic (p<0.05) and diastolic (p=0.08) blood pressure increased less. With 
longer duration of diabetes, retinopathy (p<p.001), vibration sense p<0.05), and 
AND (p<0.05) all worsened. The same held for a total score of nervous, eye and 
kidney complications (r=0.75, p<0.001), which however was not related to HbAl 
values. In conclusion, type 1 diabetics often have disturbances of the autonomic 
and peripheral nervous system that may be without symptoms and increase with the 
duration of diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: In patients with localized prostate cancer and life expectancy 
longer than 10 years, radical prostatectomy (RP) remains the Gold Standard. 
Radical surgery must achieve good oncological and functional outcomes with early 
continence and potency. In expert hands RP offers very low post-prostatectomy 
urinary incontinence rates. To analyze functional outcomes regarding urinary 
incontinence (UI) after RP in our centre in the last ten years.
METHODS: We have performed a retrospective study of the 137 patients who had a 
radical prostatectomy (open retropubic or laparoscopic) on the General 
University Hospital of Elche from 1998 to 2008. Two patient groups were 
analyzed, patients who had surgery from 1998 to 2003, and those who had surgery 
from 2004 to 2008. Stress UI rates after RP were determined in both groups at 1, 
3, 6 and 12 months following surgery with patient pad day usage. Urethrovesical 
anastomosis strictures were also analyzed in each group and their resolution.
RESULTS: 15 patients were excluded from the initial 137 because cT3 stage was 
detected, remaining 122 prostatectomies with <cT2c stage in the study. Average 
age was 67 years (50-74). Mean preoperative PSA was 8.1 ng/ml (4.5-25). Biopsy 
Gleason score was < 6 in 70% (85/122) and 7-8 in 30 % (37/122). In the period 
between 1998 and 2003, 49 patients underwent surgery and results were: initially 
continent 28.5% (14/49), continent after one month: 6.1% (3/49), at 3 months: 
12.2% (6/49), six months 8.1% ( 4/49) and at a year: 22.4%(11/49). 20.4% (10/49) 
remain with mild incontinence and moderate/severe 2% (1/49). In this period 78% 
of the patients remain continent and 22% incontinent. In the period 2004-2008, 
73 radical prostatectomies were performed with the following continence rates: 
initial continence 44% (32/73), after one month 0 patients, 3 months 6.8 % 
(5/73), 6 months 12.3 % (9/73), a year later 24.6 % (18/73). Mild incontinence 
was observed in 8.2% ( 6/73) and moderate-severe in 4% (3/73). 88% of the 
patients achieved continence and 12% remain incontinent.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary incontinence is a low frequency disorder in patients who 
undergo RP. Continence rates have been improving during the last years along 
with surgical technique and urologic expertise. Anti-incontinence devices after 
PR are rarely necessary and use is overrated.

Femoral neck fractures in young patients are a relatively rare event and are 
often the consequence of a high-energy injury. Concomitant injuries are present 
more than 50% of the time. Previous reports have found the rate of nonunion and 
avascular necrosis in this population to be as high as 35% and 45%, 
respectively. The salvage options, which tend to yield more acceptable results 
in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures, yield disproportionately poor 
results in young, active patients who are often productive members of the labor 
force. Many reports exist in the literature evaluating the various treatment 
options of these injuries. This review will address the epidemiology and 
diagnosis of the injury. In addition, the various treatment options in the acute 
presentation, as well as options available for treating the sequelae of femoral 
neck fractures in the young, will be discussed. Although longer life expectancy 
and the sustained activity level of many people previously considered elderly 
has blurred the definition of "young," this review will use the available 
literature dealing with skeletally mature patients up to the age of 60 years.

BACKGROUND: Because of demographic changes in industrialized countries, 
signifying a growing population of the aged and a markedly increased life 
expectancy, the incidence of the distal radius fracture is expected to increase 
by a further 50% until the year 2030. Osteoporosis characterizes the radius 
fracture in elderly patients. Primarily weakening metaphyseal bone, osteoporosis 
renders simple fractures unstable and makes distal bone fixation a challenge. 
The introduction of fixed-angle plate systems for extension fractures of the 
radius was evaluated in a prospective study performed at our hospital after 
selection and acquisition of a new plating system. The focus of our interest was 
whether a secondary loss of reduction can be prevented by this plating system in 
the elderly patient.
METHODS: We reviewed 58 patients aged 75 years or older treated for unstable 
distal radius fractures using a volar fixed-angle plate. Postoperative 
management included immediate finger motion, early functional use of the hand, 
wrist splint used for 4 weeks, and physiotherapy. At the time of follow-up, 
after a mean period of 13 months (range, 12-15 months), standard radiographic 
and clinical fracture parameters were measured and final functional results were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Bone healing had occurred in all patients at the time of follow-up. On 
X-rays taken at the time of follow-up, 53 patients (91%) had no radial 
shortening, 5 patients (9%) had a mean radial shortening occurred during 
follow-up of only 1.3 mm (range, 1-2 mm) compared with the contralateral side. 
Comparing the first postoperative X-rays with those taken at final evaluation 
showed no measurable loss of reduction in the volar tilt or radial inclination. 
Castaing's score yielded a perfect outcome in 25 cases, a good outcome in 30 
cases, and an adequate outcome in 3 cases. On an average, the range of motion 
was reduced by 19% during extension/flexion, by 13% during radial/ulnar 
deviation, and by 9% in pronation/supination compared with the contralateral 
side. Grip strength was 55% higher than that of the contralateral side. Eleven 
patients (19%) reported pain at rest with a mean Visual Analog Pain Scale score 
of 3.1 (range, 1-6), whereas 30 patients (52%) had pain on load-bearing with a 
mean Visual Analog Pain Scale score of 3.4 (range, 1-8). The mean disabilities 
of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score (Jester A, Harth A, Germann G. J 
Hand Surg Am. 2005;30:1074.e1-1074.e10) was 28 points. A carpal tunnel syndrome 
with abnormal nerve conduction velocity was diagnosed in three patients, a 
rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon was seen in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Fixed-angle plate osteosynthesis at the distal radius in the elderly 
patient signifies a significant improvement in the treatment of distal radial 
fractures in terms of restoration of the shape and function of the wrist 
associated with a low complication rate. This technique with its simple palmar 
access, allows exact anatomic reduction of the fracture, allows early return to 
function, and minimizes morbidity in the elderly patient. Secondary correction 
loss can be prevented by this procedure.

Chronic kidney disease: whom to screen and how to treat, part 1: definition, 
epidemiology, and laboratory testing.

Chronic kidney disease has become a major public health problem due to its high 
prevalence, its exorbitant cost, and large reductions in life expectancy and 
quality of life of affected people. Seventy percent of cases of end-stage renal 
disease are due to diabetes and hypertension, conditions which are usually 
managed by primary care providers. Other risk factors are cardiovascular 
disease, obesity, smoking, family history of kidney disease, and age greater 
than 55 years. Patients with these risk factors should be evaluated for the 
presence of chronic kidney disease during their primary care visits, because 
effective treatments for slowing progression are available, particularly if 
instituted early. Chronic kidney disease can be diagnosed by simple blood and 
urine tests, as recommended in guidelines issued by the National Kidney 
Foundation. This article begins with a case vignette, representing a common 
clinical scenario from a general internist's practice. We then review the 
definition and classification of chronic kidney disease, the epidemiology, 
etiology, and interconnections with cardiovascular disease. We discuss the 
guidelines for screening and laboratory testing, as well as the limitations of 
current assessment tools. A subsequent article will review evidence-based 
management of chronic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: With the lengthening of life expectancy among HIV-positive subjects 
related to the use of highly active antiretroviral treatments, an increased risk 
of cancer has been described in industrialized countries. The question is to 
determine what occurs now and will happen in the future in the low income 
countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where more than two-thirds of 
all HIV-positive people live in the world. The objective of our paper is to 
review the link between HIV and cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, putting it in 
perspective with what is already known in Western countries.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies for this review were identified from several 
bibliographical databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Pascal, Web of 
Science and using keywords "HIV, neoplasia, epidemiology and Africa" and related 
MesH terms. A clear association was found between HIV infection and 
AIDS-classifying cancers. In case-referent studies, odds ratios (OR) were 
ranging from 21.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 12.5-38.6) to 47.1 (31.9-69.8) 
for Kaposi sarcoma and from 5.0 (2.7-9.5) to 12.6 (2.2-54.4) for non Hodgkin 
lymphoma. The association was less strong for invasive cervical cancer with ORs 
ranging from 1.1 (0.7-1.2) to 1.6 (1.1-2.3), whereas ORs for squamous 
intraepithelial lesions were higher, from 4.4 (2.3-8.4) to 17.0 (2.2-134.1). For 
non AIDS-classifying cancers, squamous cell conjunctival carcinoma of the eye 
was associated with HIV in many case-referent studies with ORs from 2.6 
(1.4-4.9) to 13.0 (4.5-39.4). A record-linkage study conducted in Uganda showed 
an association between Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV infection with a standardized 
incidence ratio of 5.7 (1.2-17) although OR in case-referent studies ranged from 
1.4 (0.7-2.8) to 1.6 (1.0-2.7). Other cancer sites found positively associated 
with HIV include lung, liver, anus, penis, vulva, kidney, thyroid and uterus and 
a decreased risk of female breast cancer. These results so far based on a 
relatively small number of studies warrant further epidemiological 
investigations, taking into account other known risk factors for these tumors.
CONCLUSION: Studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa show that HIV infection is 
not only strongly associated with AIDS-classifying cancers but also provided 
some evidence of association for other neoplasia. African countries need now to 
implement well designed population-based studies in order to better describe the 
spectrum of AIDS-associated malignancies and the most effective strategies for 
their prevention, screening and treatment.

Azathioprine in combination with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and steroids is a 
standard therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its use, however, is 
limited by its side effects, principally leukopenia. A genotypic assay, 
thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), has been developed that can potentially 
identify those at risk for developing leukopenia with azathioprine, and thereby 
limit its toxicity. In those with abnormal TPMT activity, azathioprine can be 
started at lower dose or an alternate regimen selected. Determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy using TPMT testing before initiation 
of azathioprine, NAC, and steroids in IPF by performing a computer-based 
simulation. We developed a decision analytic model comparing three strategies: 
azathioprine, NAC and steroids with and without prior TPMT testing, and 
conservative therapy, consisting of only supportive measures. Prevalence of 
abnormal TPMT alleles and complication rates of therapy were taken from the 
literature. We assumed a 12.5% incidence of abnormal TPMT alleles, 4% overall 
incidence of leukopenia while taking azathioprine, and that azathioprine, NAC, 
and steroids in combination reduced IPF disease progression by 14% during 12 
months. TPMT testing before azathioprine, NAC, and steroids was the most 
effective and most costly strategy. The marginal cost-effectiveness of the TPMT 
testing strategy was $49,156 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained versus 
conservative treatment. Compared with azathioprine, NAC and steroids without 
prior testing, the TPMT testing strategy cost only $29,662 per QALY gained. In 
sensitivity analyses, when the prevalence of abnormal TPMT alleles was higher 
than our base case, TPMT was "cost-effective." At prevalence rates lower than 
our base case, it was not. TPMT testing before initiating therapy with 
azathioprine, NAC, and steroids is a cost-effective treatment strategy for IPF.

For the most part, the management of benign esophageal disease in all patients 
is in evolution. Advances in laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, and endoscopic 
techniques have lessened the morbidity and mortality associated with the 
traditional approaches to this pathology. Our understanding of the 
pathophysiology of primary motor disorders remains incomplete but is certainly 
more advanced than our understanding just a decade ago. As research continues in 
this area, our knowledge will increase. Persistent development efforts with 
industry will continue to provide less invasive options for the management of 
these patients, and, eventually, the results associated with these techniques 
will improve as well. For the management of these pathologies in the elderly, 
the critical issues are the associated comorbidities, the current quality of 
life, the life expectancy, and the desired quality of life. The optimal 
treatment strategy may be determined by consideration of all of these factors 
along with the relative effectiveness and durability of each treatment strategy 
for the individual elderly patient.

Chemotherapy in the older patient with operable non-small cell lung cancer: 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens.

Browner I(1), Purtell M.

Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.

Whether a patient should receive systemic therapy before or after definitive 
surgical or radiation therapy is unclear because the survival benefit is only 5% 
to 10%, but, in certain cases, the physical and economic costs of therapy may 
far outweigh the benefit. The task at hand is to apply these data to the older 
NSCLC patient. For certain individuals with significant comorbid illnesses or 
limited life expectancy, disease-free survival and improved quality of life must 
be weighed against the possible treatment-related burden needed to realize the 
demonstrated survival benefit of (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy. For fit patients 
with resectable NSCLC and a life expectancy of greater than 2 years, such 
therapies should be considered even though elderly patients may suffer increased 
but tolerable toxicity from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. At present, 
neoadjuvant therapy might be prescribed for older patients who are deemed 
borderline for curative surgery, who would benefit from tumor downstaging, or 
who would be best served with definitive radiation if the neoadjuvant response 
was suboptimal. As these and other insights are clarified and supported by 
trial-based evidence, the physician may be better able to tailor therapies to 
improve treatment outcomes and limit toxicity among all patients and, in 
particular, older patients.
