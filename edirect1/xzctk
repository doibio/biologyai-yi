30-50-year-olds with advanced fibrosis (≥F3) delays as short as a year results 
in a considerable health loss (0.25-1.04 QALYs and 0.19-1.53 years). 
Reimbursement limits for those with substance use are associated with large 
health losses. People who actively inject drugs with advanced fibrosis (≥F3) may 
lose 0.18-1.05 QALYs and 0.13-1.16 years per year of delay, despite the risk of 
reinfection and competing mortality. Results are robust to parameter uncertainty 
and key assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a clinical decision tool for informing treatment timing 
for various CHC subpopulations. In general, findings suggest that patients with 
at least moderate fibrosis should be treated promptly regardless of active drug 
use.

Background and Aims: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) combines continuous 
glucose monitoring with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). SAP is 
costlier than CSII but provides additional clinical benefits relative to CSII 
alone. A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine 
whether SAP is cost-effective relative to CSII in patients with type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) in Turkey. Methods: Analyses were performed in two different patient 
cohorts, one with poor glycemic control at baseline (mean glycated hemoglobin 
9.0% [75 mmol/mol]) and a second cohort considered to be at increased risk of 
hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data and direct medical costs were sourced 
from published literature. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer 
perspective over patient lifetimes and future costs and clinical outcomes were 
discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In both patient cohorts, SAP was 
associated with a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy but higher costs 
relative to CSII (incremental gain of 1.40 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] 
in patients with poor baseline glycemic control and 1.73 QALYs in patients at 
increased risk of hypoglycemic events). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
for SAP versus CSII were TRY 76,971 (EUR 11,612) per QALY gained for patients 
with poor baseline glycemic control and TRY 69,534 (EUR 10,490) per QALY gained 
for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Conclusions: SAP is associated 
with improved long-term clinical outcomes versus CSII, and in Turkey, SAP is 
likely to represent good value for money compared with CSII in T1D patients with 
poor glycemic control and/or with frequent severe hypoglycemic events.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health challenge and its prevalence has 
increased across the age spectrum from 1980 to date in most parts of the world 
including sub-Saharan Africa. Studies that derive health state utilities (HSUs) 
stratified by weight status to support the conduct of economic evaluations and 
prioritization of cost-effective weight management interventions are lacking in 
sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate age- and sex-specific HSUs for Ghana, along with HSUs by 
weight status. Associations between HSUs and overweight and obesity will be 
examined.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of the Ghanaian population.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the World Health Organization Study of Global 
AGEing and Adult Health (WHO SAGE), 2014 to 2015. Using a "judgment-based 
mapping" method, responses to items from the World Health Organization 
Quality-of-Life (WHOQOL-100) used in the WHO SAGE were mapped to EQ-5D-5L 
profiles, and the Zimbabwe value set was applied to calculate HSUs. 
Poststratified sampling weights were applied to estimate mean HSUs, and a 
multivariable linear regression model was used to examine associations between 
HSUs and overweight or obesity.
RESULTS: Responses from 3966 adults aged 18 to 110 years were analyzed. The mean 
(95% confidence interval) HSU was 0.856 (95% CI: 0.850, 0.863) for the 
population, 0.866 (95% CI: 0.857, 0.875) for men, and 0.849 (95% CI: 0.841, 
0.856) for women. Lower mean HSUs were observed for obese individuals and with 
older ages. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HSUs were negatively 
associated with obesity (-0.024; 95% CI: -0.037, -0.011), female sex (-0.011; 
95% CI: -0.020, -0.003), and older age groups in the population.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides HSUs by sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) 
categories for the Ghanaian population and examines associations between HSU and 
high BMI. Obesity was negatively associated with health state utility in the 
population. These data can be used in future economic evaluations for Ghana and 
sub-Saharan African populations.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the landscape of model-based economic studies in 
asthma and highlight where there is room for improvement in the design and 
reporting of studies.
DESIGN: A systematic review of the methodologies of model-based, 
cost-effectiveness analyses of asthma-related interventions was conducted. 
Models were evaluated for adherence to best-practice modeling and reporting 
guidelines and assumptions about the natural history of asthma.
METHODS: A systematic search of English articles was performed in MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, and citations within reviewed articles. Studies were summarized and 
evaluated based on their adherence to the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). We also studied the underlying 
assumptions about disease progression, heterogeneity in disease course, 
comorbidity, and treatment effects.
RESULTS: Forty-five models of asthma were included (33 Markov models, 10 
decision trees, 2 closed-form equations). Novel biological treatments were 
evaluated in 12 studies. Some of the CHEERS' reporting recommendations were not 
satisfied, especially for models published in clinical journals. This was 
particularly the case for the choice of the modeling framework and reporting on 
heterogeneity. Only 13 studies considered any subgroups, and 2 explicitly 
considered the impact of comorbidities. Adherence to CHEERS requirements and the 
quality of models generally improved over time.
CONCLUSION: It would be difficult to replicate the findings of contemporary 
model-based evaluations of asthma-related interventions given that only a 
minority of studies reported the essential parameters of their studies. Current 
asthma models generally lack consideration of disease heterogeneity and do not 
seem to be ready for evaluation of precision medicine technologies.

BACKGROUND: The threshold of sufficient evidence for adoption of clinically- and 
genomically-guided precision medicine (PM) has been unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence thresholds for clinically guided PM versus 
genomically guided PM.
METHODS: We develop an "evidence threshold criterion" (ETC), which is the 
time-weighted difference between expected value of perfect information and 
incremental net health benefit minus the cost of research, and use it as a 
measure of evidence threshold that is proportional to the upper bound of 
disutility to a risk-averse decision maker for adopting a new intervention under 
decision uncertainty. A larger (more negative) ETC value indicates that only 
decision makers with low risk aversion would adopt new intervention. We 
evaluated the ETC plus cost of research (ETCc), assuming the same cost of 
research for both interventions, over time for a pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing 
intervention and avoidance of a drug-drug interaction (aDDI) intervention for 
acute coronary syndrome patients indicated for antiplatelet therapy. We then 
examined how the ETC may explain incongruous decision making across different 
national decision-making bodies.
RESULTS: The ETCc for PGx increased over time, whereas the ETCc for aDDI 
decreased to a negative value over time, indicating that decision makers with 
even low risk aversion will have doubts in adopting PGx, whereas decision makers 
who are highly risk-averse will continue to have doubts about adopting aDDI. 
National recommendation bodies appear to be consistent over time within their 
own decision making, but had different levels of risk aversion.
CONCLUSION: The ETC may be a useful metric for assessing policy makers' risk 
preferences and, in particular, understanding differences in policy 
recommendations for genomic versus clinical PM.

OBJECTIVE: Estimates of the marginal productivity of the health sector are 
required for a wide range of resource allocation decisions. Founding these 
estimates on robust empirical analysis can inform these decisions and improve 
allocative efficiency. This article estimates the annual marginal productivity 
of the English NHS over a 10-year period (between 2003 and 2012).
METHODS: Data on expenditure and mortality by program budget category are used 
in conjunction with socioeconomic and demographic variables from the censuses 
for 2001 and 2011. This article applies an econometric strategy that employs an 
established instrumental variable approach, which is then subjected to a number 
of sensitivity analyses. The results of the econometric analysis, along with 
additional data on the burden of disease, are used to generate an estimate of 
the marginal productivity for each of the study years.
RESULTS: We find that an additional unit of health benefit has cost between 
£5000 and £15 000 per quality-adjusted life-year from 2003 to 2012. Over this 
period these estimates (all in current prices) have increased at a faster rate 
than NHS price inflation, suggesting an increase in real terms.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are discussed in the context of the existing 
literature, and the potential policy implications for decisions about resource 
allocation are explored.

OBJECTIVES: To provide the level and trends of prevalence, incidence and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 195 
countries from 1990 to 2017 by age, sex, Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a 
composite of sociodemographic factors) and Healthcare Access and Quality (an 
indicator of health system performance) Index.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
study (GBD) 2017 were used. GBD 2017 modelled the burden of RA for 195 countries 
from 1990 to 2017, through a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data 
to estimate prevalence, incidence and DALYs. All estimates were presented as 
counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 population, with uncertainty 
intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardised point prevalence and annual incidence 
rates of RA were 246.6 (95% UI 222.4 to 270.8) and 14.9 (95% UI 13.3 to 16.4) in 
2017, which increased by 7.4% (95% UI 5.3 to 9.4) and 8.2% (95% UI 5.9 to 10.5) 
from 1990, respectively. However, the age-standardised rate of RA DALYs per 100 
000 population was 43.3 (95% UI 33.0 to 54.5) in 2017, which was a 3.6% (95% UI 
-9.7 to 0.3) decrease from the 1990 rate. The age-standardised prevalence and 
DALY rates increased with age and were higher in females; the rates peaked at 
70-74 and 75-79 age groups for females and males, respectively. A non-linear 
association was found between age-standardised DALY rate and SDI. The global 
age-standardised DALY rate decreased from 1990 to 2012 but then increased and 
reached higher than expected levels in the following 5 years to 2017. The UK had 
the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (471.8 (95% UI 428.9 to 514.9)) and 
age-standardised incidence rate (27.5 (95% UI 24.7 to 30.0)) in 2017. Canada, 
Paraguay and Guatemala showed the largest increases in age-standardised 
prevalence rates (54.7% (95% UI 49.2 to 59.7), 41.8% (95% UI 35.0 to 48.6) and 
37.0% (95% UI 30.9 to 43.9), respectively) and age-standardised incidence rates 
(48.2% (95% UI 41.5 to 55.1), 43.6% (95% UI 36.6 to 50.7) and 36.8% (95% UI 30.4 
to 44.3), respectively) between 1990 and 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: RA is a major global public health challenge. The age-standardised 
prevalence and incidence rates are increasing, especially in countries such as 
Canada, Paraguay and Guatemala. Early identification and treatment of RA is 
vital especially among females, in order to reduce the ongoing burden of this 
condition. The quality of health data needs to be improved for better monitoring 
of disease burden.

The life expectancy of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is considerably 
shorter than those without SMI. Multimorbidity and poorer physical health 
outcomes contribute significantly to this health inequality. Psychotropic 
medicines, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilisers and 
anxiolytic medicines, are the mainstay of treatment for SMI, and overall improve 
life expectancy and quality of life. Optimising medicines is required to ensure 
adequate control of symptoms while avoiding complications and negative physical 
health outcomes. Screening tools would offer an opportunity to assist clinicians 
in decision making and optimising medicines for people with SMI, who are 
particularly vulnerable to medication-related problems and poorer physical 
health.

Surface electromyography-biofeedback (sEMG-B) is a technique employed for the 
rehabilitation of patients with neurological pathologies, such as stroke-derived 
hemiplegia; however, little is known about its effectiveness in the 
rehabilitation of the extension and flexion of several muscular groups in 
elderly patients after a stroke. Therefore, this research was focused on 
determining the effectiveness of sEMG-B in the muscles responsible for the 
extension of the hand and the dorsiflexion of the foot in post-stroke elderly 
subjects. Forty subjects with stroke-derived hemiplegia were randomly divided 
into intervention or control groups. The intervention consisted of 12 sEMG-B 
sessions. The control group underwent 12 weeks (24 sessions) of conventional 
physiotherapy. Muscle activity test and functionality (Barthel index) were 
determined. Attending to the results obtained, the intervention group showed a 
higher increase in the average EMG activity of the extensor muscle of the hand 
and in the dorsal flexion of the foot than the control group (p < 0.001 in both 
cases), which was associated with an increase in the patients' Barthel index 
score (p = 0.006); In addition, Fugl-Meyer test revealed higher effectiveness in 
the lower limb (p = 0.007). Thus, the sEMG-B seems to be more effective than 
conventional physiotherapy, and the use of this technology may be essential for 
improving muscular disorders in elderly patients with physical disabilities 
resulting from a stroke.

While the ecological effects of pesticides have been well studied in honeybees, 
it is unclear to what extent other anthropogenic contaminants such as air 
pollution may also negatively affect bee cognition and behaviour. To answer this 
question, we assessed the impacts of acute exposure to four ecologically 
relevant concentrations of a common urban air pollutant-diesel generated air 
pollution on honeybee odour learning and memory using a conditioned proboscis 
extension response assay. The proportion of bees that successfully learnt odours 
following direct air pollution exposure was significantly lower in bees exposed 
to low, medium and high air pollutant concentrations, than in bees exposed to 
current ambient levels. Furthermore, short- and long-term odour memory was 
significantly impaired in bees exposed to low medium and high air pollutant 
concentrations than in bees exposed to current ambient levels. These results 
demonstrate a clear and direct cognitive cost of air pollution. Given learning 
and memory play significant roles in foraging, we suggest air pollution will 
have increasing negative impacts on the ecosystem services bees provide and may 
add to the current threats such as pesticides, mites and disease affecting 
colony fitness.

Older people (aged 65 years and over) are the fastest growing age cohort in the 
majority of developed countries, and the proportion of individuals defined as 
the oldest old (aged 80 years and over) living with physical frailty and 
cognitive impairment is rising. These population changes put increasing pressure 
on health and aged care services, thus it is important to assess the cost 
effectiveness of interventions targeted for older people across health and aged 
care sectors to identify interventions with the strongest capacity to enhance 
older peoples' quality of life and provide value for money. Cost-utility 
analysis (CUA) is a form of economic evaluation that typically uses 
preference-based instruments to measure and value health-related quality of life 
for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) to enable comparisons 
of the cost effectiveness of different interventions. A variety of generic 
preference-based instruments have been used to measure older people's quality of 
life, including the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT); Health Utility 
Index Mark 2 (HUI2); Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3); Short-Form-6 Dimensions 
(SF-6D); Assessment of Quality of Life-6 dimensions (AQoL-6D); Assessment of 
Quality of Life-8 dimensions (AQoL-8D); Quality of Wellbeing 
Scale-Self-Administered (QWB-SA); 15 Dimensions (15D); EuroQol-5 dimensions 
(EQ-5D); and an older person specific preference-based instrument-the 
Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for older people (ICECAP-O). 
This article reviews the development and application of these instruments within 
the older population and discusses the issues surrounding their use with this 
population. Areas for further research relating to the development and 
application of generic preference-based instruments with populations of older 
people are also highlighted.

The review article presents data on common dermatoses in elderly patients. At 
present, this topic is practically not discussed in the Russian geriatrics. The 
urgency of the problem is increasing due to the increase in life expectancy and 
the deterioration in the availability of specialized care (in particular, 
dermatological care), especially for elderly patients. The review discusses a 
number of clinical cases in elderly patients. This article is addressed to 
geriatrics, general practitioners, general practitioners (family doctors).

Publisher: Представлены данные о распространенных дерматозах у пациентов разных 
возрастных групп, особенностях их клинического течения в пожилом и старческом 
возрасте. В настоящее время эта тема практически не обсуждается в российской 
гериатрии. Актуальность проблемы возрастает в связи с увеличением 
продолжительности жизни и ухудшением доступности специализированной помощи (в 
частности, дерматологической), особенно для пожилых пациентов. В рамках обзора 
для сравнения представлен ряд клинических случаев у пожилых пациентов.

Longer life expectancy means that chronological age is no longer a useful 
indicator of defining old age. This study included 6,452 participants aged 60 
years and older from the 2014 China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey to 
investigate the relationships between different types of social participation 
and self-perception of being old in China. Ordinary least square regression was 
applied. Results show that respondents who engaged in political participation or 
community participation reported higher self-perception of being old than those 
who did not engage in these social participations. Respondents who provided more 
care for grandchildren reported self-perception of being old at younger age. In 
the context of delaying retirement in China, obligatory participation was 
associated with an earlier start of the self-perception of being old. 
Elimination of mandatory retirement and separating that from pension eligibility 
may be good choices for promoting active aging.

Global population aging is the result of successes in public health, enabling 
longer life expectancy in many countries. The Asia Pacific region is aging more 
rapidly than many other parts of the world. The implications will be profound 
for every sector of society, requiring policy makers to reframe their thinking 
about the design of health and social systems to enable older populations to 
thrive. With increasing demand for more and different kinds of services, an 
imperative is shifting resources toward primary care for the prevention and 
comprehensive care of people with chronic conditions, and establishing linkages 
with community support. Major innovations are underway that accelerate progress 
in attaining universal health coverage for older populations. The renewed 
commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals to achieve universal health 
coverage offer a unique opportunity to invest in the foundations of the health 
system of the future.

Health and Long-Term Care Systems for Older People in the Republic of Korea: 
Policy Challenges and Lessons.

Tsukuba , Tsukuba, Ibaraki , Japan.

The Republic of Korea is experiencing a rapidly aging population with increased 
life expectancy and lowered fertility. National health insurance has provided 
universal access to health care for all since 1989, and mandatory long-term care 
insurance (LTCI) was introduced in 2008, in which everybody who contributes to 
health insurance simultaneously contributes to LTCI. Although health services 
and long-term care are universally accessible, health differentials remain 
across socioeconomic groups. LTCI covers about 7% of older people through 
eligibility assessment and provides benefits for institutional and home-based 
care and cash benefits in exceptional cases. Long-term care (LTC) benefit 
eligibility has been criticized for being excessively reliant on physical 
functionality, and recently eligibility has been extended to people with 
dementia. Despite the oversupply of LTC providers, quality of care has been a 
concern and calls for more investment in the quality evaluation system and 
training of care workers. There continues to be overreliance on inpatient care 
and unmet health care needs among LTC users as a result of weak gatekeeping by 
primary care and a lack of effective coordination between health care and LTC.

BACKGROUND: Car-dependent city planning has resulted in high levels of 
environmental pollution, sedentary lifestyles and increased vulnerability to the 
effects of climate change. The Barcelona Superblock model is an innovative urban 
and transport planning strategy that aims to reclaim public space for people, 
reduce motorized transport, promote sustainable mobility and active lifestyles, 
provide urban greening and mitigate effects of climate change. We estimated the 
health impacts of implementing this urban model across Barcelona.
METHODS: We carried out a quantitative health impact assessment (HIA) study for 
Barcelona residents ≥20 years (N = 1,301,827) on the projected Superblock area 
level (N = 503), following the comparative risk assessment methodology. We 1) 
estimated expected changes in (a) transport-related physical activity (PA), (b) 
air pollution (NO2), (c) road traffic noise, (d) green space, and (e) reduction 
of the urban heat island (UHI) effect through heat reductions; 2) scaled 
available risk estimates; and 3) calculated attributable health impact 
fractions. Estimated endpoints were preventable premature mortality, changes in 
life expectancy and economic impacts.
RESULTS: We estimated that 667 premature deaths (95% CI: 235-1,098) could be 
prevented annually through implementing the 503 Superblocks. The greatest number 
of preventable deaths could be attributed to reductions in NO2 (291, 95% PI: 
0-838), followed by noise (163, 95% CI: 83-246), heat (117, 95% CI: 101-137), 
and green space development (60, 95% CI: 0-119). Increased PA for an estimated 
65,000 persons shifting car/motorcycle trips to public and active transport 
resulted in 36 preventable deaths (95% CI: 26-50). The Superblocks were 
estimated to result in an average increase in life expectancy for the Barcelona 
adult population of almost 200 days (95% CI: 99-297), and result in an annual 
economic impact of 1.7 billion EUR (95% CI: 0.6-2.8).
DISCUSSION: The Barcelona Superblocks were estimated to help reduce harmful 
environmental exposures (i.e. air pollution, noise, and heat) while 
simultaneously increase PA levels and access to green space, and thereby provide 
substantial health benefits. For an equitable distribution of health benefits, 
the Superblocks should be implemented consistently across the entire city. 
Similar health benefits are expected for other cities that face similar 
challenges of environmental pollution, climate change vulnerability and low PA 
levels, by adopting the Barcelona Superblock model.

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic hypocalcemia is a common complication of total 
thyroidectomy. Management strategies include responsive treatment initiation for 
symptoms or prevention by routine or parathyroid hormone-directed calcium 
supplementation. The comparative cost-effectiveness of even the most often 
utilized strategies is unclear.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was created to compare routine supplementation 
with calcium alone (RS), postoperative parathyroid hormone-based selective 
supplementation with calcium and calcitriol (SS), and no supplementation (NS) in 
asymptomatic patients. Patients could remain asymptomatic or develop symptomatic 
hypocalcemia, managed with outpatient oral supplementation or intravenous 
calcium infusion and administered either inpatient or outpatient. Effectiveness 
was measured in quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
to test model parameter assumptions.
RESULTS: RS was the preferred strategy, costing $329/patient and resulting in 
0.497 quality-adjusted life years, which was only marginally better compared to 
SS ($373 for 0.495 quality-adjusted life years). NS was most costly at $4,955 
for 0.491 quality-adjusted life years. Preference for RS over SS was sensitive 
to the probability of developing symptoms and the probability of symptom 
treatment with intravenous supplementation. On probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, RS was preferred in 75.4% of scenarios.
CONCLUSION: After total thyroidectomy, a preventative calcium supplementation 
strategy should be strongly considered. In this data-driven theoretical model, 
RS was the least costly option and resulted in an incremental gain in 
quality-adjusted life years.

Recently, the Dutch Health Council advised on elderly pneumococcal vaccination 
favouring the conventional polysaccharide vaccine over the novel conjugated 
vaccine. This advice was strongly inspired by a cost-effectiveness analysis 
considered to show favourable outcomes for the polysaccharide but not for the 
conjugated vaccine. We argue that using the same data and methods as presented 
by the Health Council, a different perspective on the results leads to a 
conclusion that not only the polysaccharide but also the conjugated pneumococcal 
vaccine is cost-effective. Our alternative perspective concerns the use of 
realistic vaccine prices, and applying an adequate time horizon for 
cost-effectiveness modelling. Notably, for one-off vaccination of 65-years old 
elderly, in all investigated analyses, also the conjugated vaccine seems 
cost-effective; i.e. well below the threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year, reflecting the most stringent threshold used for vaccines in the 
Netherlands.

3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase (HMGL) is involved in 
branched-chain amino acid catabolism leading to acetyl-CoA production. Here, 
using bioinformatics analyses and protein sequence alignments, we found that in 
Arabidopsis thaliana a single gene encodes two HMGL isoforms differing in size 
(51 kDa, HMGL51 and 46 kDa, HMGL46). Similar to animal HMGLs, both isoforms 
comprised a C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal retention motif, and HMGL51 contained 
a mitochondrial leader peptide. We observed that only a shortened HMGL (35 kDa, 
HMGL35) is conserved across all kingdoms of life. Most notably, all plant HMGLs 
also contained a specific N-terminal extension (P100) that is located between 
the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence TP35 and HMGL35 and is absent in 
bacteria and other eukaryotes. Interestingly, using HMGL enzyme assays, we found 
that rather than HMGL46, homodimeric recombinant HMGL35 is the active enzyme 
catalyzing acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate synthesis when incubated with 
(S)-HMG-CoA. This suggested that the plant-specific P100 peptide may inactivate 
HMGL according to specific physiological requirements. Therefore, we 
investigated whether the P100 peptide in HMGL46 alters its activity, possibly by 
modifying the HMGL46 structure. We found that induced expression of a cytosolic 
HMGL35 version in A. thaliana delays germination and leads to rapid wilting and 
chlorosis in mature plants. Our results suggest that in plants, P100-mediated 
HMGL inactivation outside of peroxisomes or mitochondria is crucial, protecting 
against potentially cytotoxic effects of HMGL activity while it transits to 
these organelles.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a lifelong condition. The CP quality of 
life (CPQOL) instrument is a frequently used disease-specific instrument to 
assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CP, but it cannot 
be used to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) which are the basis of 
cost utility analysis (CUA). Generic utility instruments (such as the EQ-5D or 
SF-6D) that are used to value HRQOL may be insensitive to small but important 
health changes in children with CP. This study aims to generate a 
preference-based scoring algorithm for the CP six dimensions (CP-6D), a 
classification system developed from the CPQOL.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A discrete choice experiment with duration (DCEtto) will 
be administrated to value health states described by the CP-6D classification 
system. These health states will be presented to members of Australian general 
population and parents of children with CP via an online survey. Conditional 
logit regression will be used to produce the utility algorithm for CP-6D.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Griffith University Human Research Ethics 
Committee approved for the study (reference HREC/number 2018/913). The developed 
algorithm can be applied to previous and future economic evaluation of 
interventions and treatments targeting people with CP which have used either the 
CPQOL or CP-6D.

BACKGROUND: The cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, is one of the most 
destructive pests in the Mediterranean basin, being predominantly controlled 
using synthetic chemical pesticides. Strain EAMa 01/58-Su of the fungus 
Metarhizium brunneum and the parasitoid Hyposoter didymator are promising 
biological control agents for this pest. In this study, we assessed the 
compatibility between these two agents to control S. littoralis under joint 
attack scenarios.
RESULTS: Firstly, the direct and indirect effects of the fungus towards 
parasitoid adults were studied. The fungus significantly decreased life 
expectancy of the parasitoid (mortality = 62.5%; mean lethal 
concentration = 1.85 × 106 conidia ml-1 ; average survival time = 92.2 h) when 
applied at high concentrations (108 conidia ml-1 ), whereas it did not affect 
the reproductive potential of the parasitoid females during the 3 days after 
treatment. Secondly, the combinations between the two agents to control S. 
littoralis under different simultaneous use scenarios (inoculation of S. 
littoralis larvae with the fungus before being exposed to parasitoid females and 
vice versa) were investigated, with additive effect in all cases. A significant 
effect on fitness (preimaginal development time and reproductive potential) of 
the F1 parasitoid generation were detected. Moreover, parasitization 
significantly reduced the total hemocytes in S. littoralis hemolymph compared 
with the control, promoting fungal infection. Finally, parasitoids showed a 
significant preference for non-inoculated S. littoralis larvae.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated compatibility (additive effect) between fungus and 
parasitoid under different joint attack scenarios to control S. littoralis in 
laboratory conditions. However, this will be supported by our ongoing greenhouse 
and field studies. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

Aims: The objective of the study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
percutaneous mitral valve repair (TMVr) with the MitraClip NT system (MitraClip 
procedure) for patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation (MR) at 
high surgical risk in line with the methodological guideline for 
cost-effectiveness evaluation by the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare.Material and Methods: The cost-effectiveness of MitraClip procedure was 
evaluated using a Markov model. Patients are classified into four New York Heart 
Association classes in each cycle. The model considered MitraClip complication 
("major vascular complication", "major bleeding complication", "non-cerebral 
thromboembolism"), adverse events, re-implantation with MitraClip device, mitral 
valve surgery, and congestive heart failure hospitalization. For the evidence on 
additional benefits, a study compared with propensity score-matched medical 
therapy group was used in the analysis. The analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of a public healthcare payer with a discount rate of 2% for both 
cost and effectiveness.Results: In the base-case analysis, total cost and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (Life year (LY) gained) were 7,541,151 
JPY and 3.23 QALYs (3.85 LYs) for MitraClip group, and 4,699,692 JPY and 1.79
