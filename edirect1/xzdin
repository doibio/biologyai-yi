    BMJ Glob Health. 2021 May;6(5):

A comprehensive evidence-based framework is needed to guide policies and 
programmes that enable children and adolescents to accrue the human capital 
required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper proposes a 
comprehensive, multisectoral, multilevel life-course conceptualisation of human 
capital development by building on the Nurturing Care Framework (NCF), 
originally developed for the foundational period of growth and development 
through the age 3 years. Nurturing care (NC) comprises stable environments that 
promote children's health and nutrition, protect from threats, and provide 
opportunities for learning and responsive, emotionally supportive and 
developmentally enriching relationships. NC is fostered by families, 
communities, services, national policies and beyond. The principles apply across 
the life course, endorse equity and human rights, and promote long-term human 
capital. This paper presents an evidence-based argument for the extension of the 
NCF from preconception through adolescence (0-20 years), organised into six 
developmental periods: preconception/prenatal, newborn/birth, 
infancy/toddlerhood, preschool, middle childhood and adolescence. The proposed 
framework advances human capital within each developmental period by promoting 
resilience and adaptive developmental trajectories while mitigating negative 
consequences of adversities.Attaining the SDGs depends on strengthening human 
capital formation, extending throughout childhood and adolescence and supported 
by NC. Embedded in enabling laws, policies and services, the dynamic NCF 
components can mitigate adversities, enhance resilience and promote the 
well-being of marginalised groups. The life-course extension of the NCF is 
strategically positioned to enhance human capital, to attain the SDGs and to 
ensure that children or adolescents are not left behind in reaching their 
developmental potential.

Road, Yuhang District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. wangjf@ipharmacare.net.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is the standard 
second-line option for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth 
factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer for its superior clinical 
efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival. The objective of this study 
was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of T-DM1 from the Chinese healthcare 
perspective. Capecitabine (Cap), capecitabine + lapatinib (Cap + Lap), 
capecitabine + trastuzumab (Cap + Tra), capecitabine + trastuzumab + pertuzumab 
(Cap + Tra + Per) were selected as comparators.
METHODS: A three-state Markov simulation model was performed. The state 
transition probabilities were estimated based on the results of a published 
network meta-analysis, and utilities were derived from the published literature. 
The costs populated in the model were acquired from the local charge or 
previously published studies. One-way sensitive analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Compared with Cap, Cap + Lap, Cap + Tra, and Cap + Tra + Per, T-DM1 was 
estimated to increase the cost by US$109,699.1, $106,019.1, $97,506.3, and 
$67,121.9, respectively, and yield a gain of 0.544 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), 0.383 QALYs, 0.367 QALYs, 0.087 QALYs, respectively. Corresponding 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $201,652.9, $276,812.5, 
$265,685.0, and $771,516.1 per QALY. The probabilities of T-DM1 as the dominant 
option were 0% at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $31,245.1/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1, as second-line therapy in the treatment of HER2-positive 
breast cancer, is not a cost-effective option in China. Given the significant 
clinical efficacy, an appropriate price reduction of T-DM1 is required to 
benefit more HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) in broadening the network of gatekeepers in rural 
communities.
METHOD: Extension agents in Mississippi who completed MHFA training were 
recruited via email to participate in a 22-item, web-based, quantitative and 
qualitative, six-month follow-up survey that measured demographic 
characteristics, which MHFA skills agents used post-training, barriers to skill 
use, and confidence in ability to use those skills (n = 80).
RESULTS: Over 60% of the agents reported using the skills learned from the MHFA 
training, and nearly 15% of agents reported having an encounter with someone in 
crisis since completing the MHFA training. Agent participants reported using the 
skills learned from the training with farmers, 4-H youth, volunteers, and 
parents, family members, colleagues, and friends. One agent commented that the 
training, "has been very helpful in speaking with various people and has 
increased confidence when encountering someone with mental health challenges."
CONCLUSION: MHFA trainings appear to increase the confidence and competence of 
Extension agents as community gatekeepers and may greatly enhance the reach of 
the mental health network of rural areas by increasing identification and 
referral of those requiring mental health services.

BACKGROUND: Focal therapy (FT) with its favorable side-effect profile represents 
an option between active surveillance and traditional whole-gland treatment in 
localized prostate cancer (PCa). Consensus statements recommend eligibility 
criteria based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted and systematic 
combination biopsy.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the future potential of FT by analyzing the number of men 
eligible for FT among all men with biopsy-proven PCa and to judge the potential 
of different energy sources.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Consensus criteria on FT were analyzed. 
Patients with biopsy-proven PCa from six tertiary referral hospitals and one 
outpatient practice in Germany had received a software-based combination biopsy. 
Men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) ≥3 lesions based 
on PI-RADS v2 were included.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patients were analyzed for 
potential treatment by FT and hemiablation. MRI lesions were mapped according to 
prostatic zones.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 2371 patients were analyzed. According to 
consensus criteria (biopsy-proven unifocal lesion of International Society of 
Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group ≤2, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 
≤15ng/mL, and life expectancy >10yr), 303 patients (12.8%; ISUP 1: n=148 [6.2%]; 
ISUP 2: n=155 [6.5%]) were potential candidates for FT. A maximum PSA level of 
<10ng/mL would exclude further 60 (2.5%) of these men. The eligibility for 
hemiablation is slightly higher (16.2%). Unifocal lesions (n=288) were equally 
distributed within the prostate (anteriorly [31%], apically [29%], and dorsally 
[36%]).
CONCLUSIONS: With adherence to consensus statements, only a minority of PCa 
patients present as potential candidates for FT. Distribution of tumor 
localization suggests the need for different energy modalities to warrant an 
optimal FT treatment.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyzed how many men who receive a magnetic resonance 
imaging-targeted and systematic prostate biopsy are candidates for the 
experimental focal therapy of the prostate. When following expert 
recommendations, only a small number of men are potential candidates for this 
alternative treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the evolving landscape of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol-lowering therapies (LLTs) and quantify their effect on 
cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality and morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data came from LLT clinical trials and 1999-2014 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. 1996-2016 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data were used to estimate LLT spending. 
Nonfatal CVD events prevented by LLTs were calculated from clinical trials and 
NHANES. The value of nonfatal events prevented was calculated as the product of 
event treatment costs and the number of events prevented. The value of mortality 
reduction was calculated as the product of a value of a life-year and the life 
expectancy gain from LLTs. This was compared with LLT spending estimated using 
MEPS.
METHODS: Total LLT expenditures were calculated based on MEPS LLT utilization 
and expenditure data. Values of prevented hospitalizations, prevented CVD 
events, and other LLT utilization-related outcomes were pulled from the 
published literature.
RESULTS: Combined, statins and ezetimibe prevented 2.8 million nonfatal heart 
attacks and 1.7 million nonfatal strokes from 1999 to 2014. Statin use generated 
$2.6 trillion in societal value through CVD deaths avoided from 1987 to 2014, 
and 85% accrued to patients.
CONCLUSIONS: LLTs have yielded significant societal value, and the majority of 
this value has accrued to patients.

PURPOSE: To assess the association between hypometabolic extension of 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and diffusion tensor imaging 
indices, including mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), in 
hippocampal sclerosis (HS).
METHODS: Thirty-six unilateral HS were retrospectively selected and stratified 
into two groups: broad and localized hypometabolic groups (hypometabolism beyond 
[n = 26] and within the temporal lobe [n = 10]). Forty-one pairs of gray matter 
(GM) regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented using FreeSurfer software. The GM 
ROIs were applied to MD maps, and median MD values within each ROI were compared 
between hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to HS using a mixed effect 
model. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was used to evaluate FA of white 
matter (WM) tracts between hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to HS. 
Disease laterality was controlled for.
RESULTS: The MD values in the thalamus, caudate, hippocampus, amygdala, superior 
frontal gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, and isthmus 
cingulate gyrus were significantly higher in the HS side than the contralateral 
side for the broad hypometabolic group. Those in the amygdala and superior 
temporal sulcus were significantly higher in the HS side than the contralateral 
side for the localized group. The TBSS analyses showed significantly decreased 
FA in the WM tracts of the temporal and frontal lobes for the broad 
hypometabolic group, while no tracts showed significant differences for the 
localized group.
CONCLUSION: The hypometabolic extension for HS was associated with the 
abnormalities of MD and FA in GM and WM, respectively, with more widespread 
microstructural alterations for broad hypometabolic HS.

In this article, we describe an extension of general anaesthesia - beyond 
facilitating surgery - to the relief of suffering during dying. Some refractory 
symptoms at the end of life (pain, delirium, distress, dyspnoea) might be 
managed by analgesia, but in high doses, adverse effects (e.g. respiratory 
depression) can hasten death. Sedation may be needed for agitation or distress 
and can be administered as continuous deep sedation (also referred to as 
terminal or palliative sedation) generally using benzodiazepines. However, for 
some patients these interventions are not enough, and others may express a clear 
desire to be completely unconscious as they die. We summarise the historical 
background of an established practice that we refer to as 'general anaesthesia 
in end-of-life care'. We discuss its contexts and some ethical and legal issues 
that it raises, arguing that these are largely similar issues to those already 
raised by continuous deep sedation. To be a valid option, general anaesthesia in 
end-of-life care will require a clear multidisciplinary framework and consensus 
practice guidelines. We see these as an impending development for which the 
specialty should prepare. General anaesthesia in end-of-life care raises an 
important debate about the possible role of anaesthesia in the relief of 
suffering beyond the context of surgical/diagnostic interventions.

Kings and queens of termites, like queens of other advanced eusocial insects, 
are endowed with admirable longevity, which dramatically exceeds the life 
expectancies of their non-reproducing nest-mates and related solitary insects. 
In the quest to find the mechanisms underlying the longevity of termite 
reproductives, we focused on somatic maintenance mediated by telomerase. This 
ribonucleoprotein is well established for pro-longevity functions in 
vertebrates, thanks primarily to its ability of telomere extension. However, its 
participation in lifespan regulation of insects, including the eusocial taxa, 
remains understudied. Here, we report a conspicuous increase of telomerase 
abundance and catalytic activity in the somatic organs of primary and secondary 
reproductives of the termite Prorhinotermes simplex and confirm a similar 
pattern in two other termite species. These observations stand in contrast with 
the telomerase downregulation characteristic for most adult somatic tissues in 
vertebrates and also in solitary insects and non-reproducing castes of termites. 
At the same time, we did not observe caste-specific differences in telomere 
lengths that might explain the differential longevity of termite castes. We 
conclude that although the telomerase activation in termite reproductives is in 
line with the broadly assumed association between telomerase and longevity, its 
direct phenotypic impact remains to be elucidated.

BACKGROUND: TAS-102 plus bevacizumab is an anticipated combination regimen for 
patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer. However, evidence supporting its 
use for this indication is limited. We compared the cost-effectiveness of 
TAS-102 plus bevacizumab combination therapy with TAS-102 monotherapy for 
patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHOD: Markov decision modeling using treatment costs, disease-free survival, 
and overall survival was performed to examine the cost-effectiveness of TAS-102 
plus bevacizumab combination therapy and TAS-102 monotherapy. The Japanese 
health care payer's perspective was adopted. The outcomes were modeled on the 
basis of published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
between the two treatment regimens was the primary outcome. Sensitivity analysis 
was performed and the effect of uncertainty on the model parameters were 
investigated.
RESULTS: TAS-102 plus bevacizumab had an ICER of $21,534 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained compared with TAS-102 monotherapy. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that TAS-102 monotherapy was more cost-effective than TAS-102 and 
bevacizumab combination therapy at a willingness-to-pay of under $50,000 per 
QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: TAS-102 and bevacizumab combination therapy is a cost-effective 
option for patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer in the Japanese health 
care system.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and natural history of sporadic 
inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and to test the hypothesis that patients with 
sIBM have higher cancer or mortality rates than the general population.
METHODS: We sought patients with sIBM defined by the 2011 European Neuromuscular 
Centre (ENMC) diagnostic criteria among Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents in 
40-year time period.
RESULTS: We identified 20 patients (10 clinicopathologically defined, 9 
clinically defined, and 1 probable) according to the ENMC criteria and 1 patient 
with all features of clinicopathologically defined sIBM except for symptom onset 
at <45 years of age. The prevalence of sIBM in 2010 was 18.20 per 100,000 people 
≥50 years old. Ten patients developed cancers. The incidence of cancers in sIBM 
did not differ from that observed in the general population (odds ratio 1.89, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.639-5.613, p = 0.24). Two-thirds of patients 
developed dysphagia, and half required a feeding tube. Nine patients required a 
wheelchair. The median time from symptom onset to wheelchair dependence was 10.5 
(range 1-29) years. Overall life expectancy was shorter in the sIBM group 
compared to the general population (84.1 [95% CI 78-88.4] vs 87.5 [95% CI 
85.2-89.5] years, p = 0.03). Thirteen patients died; 9 deaths were sIBM related 
(7 respiratory and 2 unspecified sIBM complications). Female sex (p = 0.03) and 
dysphagia (p = 0.05) were independent predictors of death.
CONCLUSION: Olmsted County has the highest prevalence of sIBM reported to date. 
Patients with sIBM have similar risk of cancer, but slightly shorter life 
expectancy compared to matched patients without sIBM.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that patients 
with sIBM have similar risks of cancers and slightly shorter life expectancy 
compared to controls.

BACKGROUND: Uncertainty in model-based cost-utility analyses is commonly 
assessed in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model parameters are 
implemented as distributions and values are sampled from these distributions in 
a Monte Carlo simulation. Bootstrapping is an alternative method that requires 
fewer assumptions and incorporates correlations between model parameters.
METHODS: A Markov model-based cost-utility analysis comparing oromucosal spray 
containing delta-9-tetrahidrocannabinol + cannabidiol (Sativex®, nabiximols) 
plus standard care versus standard spasticity care alone in the management of 
multiple sclerosis spasticity was performed over a 5-year time horizon from the 
Belgian healthcare payer perspective. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
implemented using a bootstrap approach to ensure that the correlations present 
in the source clinical trial data were incorporated in the uncertainty 
estimates.
RESULTS: Adding Sativex® spray to standard care was found to dominate standard 
spasticity care alone, with cost savings of €6,068 and a quality-adjusted life 
year gain of 0.145 per patient over the 5-year analysis. The probability of 
dominance increased from 29% in the first year to 94% in the fifth year, with 
the probability of QALY gains in excess of 99% for all years considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding Sativex® spray to spasticity care was found to dominate 
standard spasticity care alone in the Belgian healthcare setting. This study 
showed the use of bootstrapping techniques in a Markov model probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis instead of Monte Carlo simulations. Bootstrapping avoided 
the need to make distributional assumptions and allowed the incorporation of 
correlating structures present in the original clinical trial data in the 
uncertainty assessment.

PURPOSE: Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increased interest on 
nutritional interventions have led to improvements in life expectancy of people 
living with HIV (PLHIV). These have led to greater emphasis on their quality of 
life (QoL). This study was aimed at exploring the effects of Moringa oleifera 
leaves supplementation on QoL of HIV-positive adults in Nigeria.
METHOD: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine 
the six months' impact of consuming Moringa oleifera leaves powder as a 
nutritional supplement on the different domains of QoL of PLHIV that are on ART. 
Two hundred consented patients were randomly allocated to either Moringa 
Oleifera group (MOG) or control group (COG). The WHOQOL-HIV-BREF was used to 
assess QoL at baseline and at six-month follow-up.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy seven patients completed the study. At 
six-month follow-up, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the mean scores of all 
the six domains of QoL was observed in the MOG. However, in the COG, a 
significant increase was observed in the social relationship, environment, and 
spirituality/religion/personal beliefs domains. The comparison between the MOG 
and COG at 6 months' follow-up showed a significant mean score difference in the 
MOG in the physical, psychological, level of independence, and social 
relationships domains of QoL.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that supplementation with Moringa oleifera leaves 
for PLHIV that are on ART improves the QoL domains of physical, psychological, 
level of independence, and social relationships. Clinical Trial Registry 
registration number: PACTR201811722056449.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) mainly involves women, impacting many 
aspects related to childbearing age and maternity. Women with MS can have 
healthy pregnancies and infants. Needs, challenges and concerns of women with MS 
should be considered in order to improve care pathway, ensuring a 
patient-centred approach. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore 
personal experiences, expectations, fears in women with MS.
METHODS: A descriptive phenomenological study, including women with MS during 
childbearing age, pregnancy and motherhood, carried out from January to April 
2019. Women, enrolled in a MS centre with snowball sampling through healthcare 
network, were invited for a face-to-face or phone interview, digitally 
audio-recorded and fully transcribed. Two different sets of semi-structured 
interviews were developed (woman seeking pregnancy / pregnant woman and mother), 
together with an anonymous form, to collect some main sociodemographic data. 
Categorical data analysis, inductively and deductively, was processed by 3 
different researchers, using Creswell extension to reduce subjective influences. 
QDA Miner qualitative text analysis software was used.
RESULTS: The following 6 deductive themes emerged: 1) experience with diagnosis 
of MS; 2) relationship with the partner, children, and family; 3) pregnancy; 4) 
delivery; 5) puerperium; 6) care pathway. Experiences with diagnosis can be very 
different between women. Communication of MS diagnosis appears as an opportunity 
to strengthen emotional ties, despite sorrow and concerns. Reasons for quarrels 
and disagreements, both in couple and parents, were due to an overly protective 
and supportive attitude. Some participants reported difficulty of conceiving. 
Pregnancy is described as a state of wellbeing, not devoid by fears and worries. 
Women experienced fatigue and exhaustion especially during the second stage of 
labour, but spontaneous delivery is described as an empowering experience. 
Findings about breastfeeding confirm that healthcare professionals have a 
crucial role regarding initiation, duration and type of breastfeeding and often 
scarce education and training on the topic, together with lack of reliable 
scientific sources, lead to a conservative approach. Healthcare providers 
communication and consulting emerge as indispensable skills.
CONCLUSION: The study provides a better understanding of how MS impacts women' 
life during childbearing age, pregnancy and motherhood. Findings support the 
importance of provide quality and tailored care for women with MS, according to 
an empathetic and patient-centred approach. Further research should be more 
comprehensive explorations of mothers' experiences in different cultural 
contexts, but also partners and offspring of women with MS.

The Quality of Life of Thalassemic Patients: The Role of Endocrine Defect 
Compensation.

BACKGROUND: The improvement of beta thalassaemia treatments has led to an 
increase in life expectancy. This implies the emergence of new comorbidities. 
Amongst others, endocrine glands are extremely sensitive to iron overload.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the impact of the endocrine conditions on the 
patient's quality of life (QOL).
RESULTS: Hypogonadism may present with lack or delay of pubertal development, 
sexual dysfunctions and impaired fertility, which impact QOL in both sexes. 
Early recognition and treatment, as well as choosing the most appropriate 
therapy, according to patient's needs (fertility, pubertal development, 
psychological concerns, comorbidities), are advisable. Osteoporosis affects QOL 
irrespective of symptoms. Growth hormone deficiency may occur both in childhood 
and in adulthood, and it affects different aspects of QOL. In adults, it could 
be difficult to examine if the symptoms are due to GHD, and a trial of GH 
replacement could be useful to identify benefits and needs. Glucose metabolism 
impairment is common in thalassaemic patients and early recognition is mandatory 
because long-term complications can have a detrimental impact on QOL (as 
blindness or dialysis). Although the incidence of adrenal insufficiency seems to 
be rare in thalassaemic patients, when it occurs, it has a severe impact on QOL.
CONCLUSION: Limited data is available on QOL in thalassaemic patients, and is 
even less related to endocrinopathies. We can speculate that endocrinopathies 
have an impact on everyday life. More studies are needed to allow our patients 
to achieve not just a longer life but also a better quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Impact of recurrent pericarditis (RP) on patient health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated through qualitative patient interviews and 
as an exploratory endpoint in a Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of rilonacept (IL-1α/IL-1β cytokine trap) to treat RP.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with ten adults with RP to 
understand symptoms and HRQoL impacts, and the 10-item Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS GH) v1.2 was evaluated to 
determine questionnaire coverage of patient experience. The Phase 2 trial 
enrolled participants with active symptomatic RP (A-RP, n = 16) and 
corticosteroid-dependent participants with no active recurrence at baseline 
(CSD-RP, n = 9). All participants received rilonacept weekly during a 6-week 
base treatment period (TP) plus an optional 18-week extension period (EP). 
Tapering of concomitant medications, including corticosteroids (CS), was 
permitted during EP. HRQoL was assessed using the PROMIS GH, and 
patient-reported pain and blood levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) were 
collected at Baseline and follow-up periods. A secondary, descriptive analysis 
of the Phase 2 trial efficacy results was completed using HRQoL measures to 
characterize both the impact of RP and the treatment effect of rilonacept.
RESULTS: Information from qualitative interviews demonstrated that PROMIS GH 
concepts are relevant to adults with RP. From the Phase 2 trial, both 
participant groups showed impacted HRQoL at Baseline (mean PROMIS Global 
Physical Health [GPH] and Global Mental Health [GMH], were lower than population 
norm average). In A-RP, GPH/MPH improved by end of base TP and were sustained 
through EP (similar trends were observed for pain and CRP). Similarly, in 
CSD-RP, GPH/MPH improved by end of TP and further improved during EP, during CS 
tapering or discontinuation, without disease recurrence (low pain scores and CRP 
levels continued during the TP and EP).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating impaired HRQoL in RP. 
Rilonacept treatment was associated with HRQoL improvements using PROMIS GH 
scores. Maintained/improved HRQoL during tapering/withdrawal of CS without 
recurrence suggests that rilonacept may provide an alternative to CS.

BACKGROUND: Low vegetable intake is one of the key dietary risk factors known to 
be associated with a range of health problems, including cardiovascular diseases 
(CVDs), cancer, and diabetes and kidney diseases (DKDs). Using data from Japan's 
National Health and Nutrition Surveys and the Global Burden of Diseases study in 
2017, this study aimed to forecast the impact of change in vegetable intake on 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2017 and 2040 for three diseases.
METHODS: We generated a three-component model of cause-specific DALYs, including 
changes in major behavioural and metabolic risk predictors, the 
socio-demographic index and an autoregressive integrated moving average model to 
project future DALY rates for 2017-2040 using the data between 1990 and 2016. 
Data on Vegetable consumption and risk predictors, and DALY rate were obtained 
from Japan's National Health and Nutrition Surveys and the Global Burden of 
Diseases Study in 2017. We also modelled three scenarios of better, moderate and 
worse cases to evaluate the impact of change in vegetable consumption on the 
DALY rates for three diseases (CVDs, cancer, and DKDs).
RESULTS: Projected mean vegetable intake in the total population showed a 
decreasing trend through 2040 to 237.7 g/day. A significant difference between 
the reference scenario and the better case scenario was observed with 
un-overlapped 95% prediction intervals of DALY rates in females aged 20-49 years 
(- 8.0%) for CVDs, the total population for cancer (- 5.6%), and in males 
(- 8.2%) and females (- 13.7%) for DKDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that increased vegetable consumption would 
have a significant reduction in the burdens of CVDs, cancer and DKDs in Japan. 
By estimating the disease burden attributable to low vegetable intake under 
different scenarios of future vegetable consumption, our study can inform the 
design of targeted interventions for public health challenges.

AIM: Aim of cross-sectional study was to survey the risk of diabetes mellitus in 
a severely disadvantaged Hungarian community and then to use laboratory tests to 
screen for potential carbohydrate metabolism disorders among those in the 
moderate- and high-risk groups.
BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus shows a worrisome trend 
worldwide. Low socio-economic status significantly affects the development of 
diabetes, healthy life years and life expectancy.
METHOD: Diabetes risk of the population was surveyed with the FINDRISC (Finnish 
Diabetes Risk Score) questionnaire, followed by oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) and glycated haemoglobin test of moderate- and high-risk patients.
FINDINGS: In sample of 551 subjects, moderate or high risk for diabetes was 
confirmed in 147 patients (26.68%). There was significant correlation between 
increased risk and age (P < 0.001) and between increased risk and body mass
