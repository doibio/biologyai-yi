in Kosovo was quite low, particularly among women. About 47% of respondents 
perceived themselves as poor, or extremely poor (41% of men and 52% of women). 
In multivariable-adjusted models, self-perceived poverty was higher among older 
women, low educated individuals, urban residents, and elderly individuals living 
alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that the socioeconomic situation 
of the elderly population in Kosovo is rather challenging. Demographic trends 
coupled with the economic and political transition raise serious concerns about 
increasing needs for socioeconomic support of elderly people in Kosovo. Specific 
policies and actions should be considered by a number of stakeholders, including 
government and civil society in transitional Kosovo.

The focus of this study is using data glove to practice Joint attention skill in 
virtual reality environment for people with pervasive developmental disorder 
(PDD). The virtual reality environment provides a safe environment for PDD 
people. Especially, when they made errors during practice in virtual reality 
environment, there is no suffering or dangerous consequences to deal with. Joint 
attention is a critical skill in the disorder characteristics of children with 
PDD. The absence of joint attention is a deficit frequently affects their social 
relationship in daily life. Therefore, this study designed the Joint Attention 
Skills Learning (JASL) systems with data glove tool to help children with PDD to 
practice joint attention behavior skills. The JASL specifically focus the skills 
of pointing, showing, sharing things and behavior interaction with other 
children with PDD. The system is designed in playroom-scene and presented in the 
first-person perspectives for users. The functions contain pointing and showing, 
moving virtual objects, 3D animation, text, speaking sounds, and feedback. The 
method was employed single subject multiple-probe design across subjects' 
designs, and analysis of visual inspection in this study. It took 3 months to 
finish the experimental section. Surprisingly, the experiment results reveal 
that the participants have further extension in improving the joint attention 
skills in their daily life after using the JASL system. The significant 
potential in this particular treatment of joint attention for each participant 
will be discussed in details in this paper.

Since the advent of HAART, patients with HIV infection have seen a significant 
improvement in their morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy. The incidence of 
AIDS-defining illnesses, including AIDS-defining malignancies, has been on the 
decline. However, deaths due to non-AIDS-defining illnesses have been on the 
rise. These so-called non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) include cancers of the 
lung, liver, kidney, anus, head and neck, and skin, as well as Hodgkin's 
lymphoma. It is poorly understood why this higher rate of NADCs is occurring. 
The key challenge facing oncologists is how to administer chemotherapy 
effectively and safely to patients on antiretroviral therapy. The challenge to 
clinicians caring for HIV-infected patients is to develop and implement 
effective means to screen, treat, and prevent NADCs in the future. This review 
presents data on the epidemiology and etiology of NADCs, as well as ongoing 
research into this evolving aspect of the HIV epidemic.

Does variation in either age at start of therapy or duration of therapy make 
chemoprevention with finasteride cost-effective?

BACKGROUND: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of finasteride for 
prostate cancer prevention are consistent with estimates beyond $100 000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The majority of these analyses are based on 
chemoprevention starting in men aged 50-55 years. We sought to evaluate the 
impact of varying both age at commencement of therapy and length of therapy on 
the cost-effectiveness of finasteride.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was designed to estimate lifetime prostate 
health-related costs and quality-adjusted survival for men receiving or not 
receiving chemoprevention with finasteride. ICERs across scenarios varying age 
at start of therapy and duration of chemoprevention were compared.
RESULTS: The ICER for men starting chemoprevention at age 50 and continuing to 
age 75 was $88 800 per QALY when assuming finasteride causes a constant risk 
reduction across all tumor grades (base case 1) and $142 300 per QALY when 
assuming a differential treatment effect according to Gleason score (base case 
2). When starting age is increased, the ICERs trend downward and nadir at 65 
years to $64 700 per QALY (base case 1) and $118 600 per QALY (base case 2). 
Altering duration of therapy had minimal impact. Patient-level experiences with 
finasteride and BPH significantly influenced the cost-effectiveness of 
chemoprevention.
CONCLUSIONS: Initiating chemoprevention at ages when prostate cancer incidence 
is higher improves its cost-effectiveness profile. Only when assuming a constant 
risk reduction for all tumor grades, did finasteride fall below $100 000 per 
QALY, but this finding was not upheld when accounting for side effects 
associated with the drug.

Sedentary behaviour and life expectancy in the USA: a cause-deleted life table 
analysis.

Katzmarzyk PT(1), Lee IM.

Author information:
(1)Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University System, 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of sitting and television viewing on life 
expectancy in the USA.
DESIGN: Prevalence-based cause-deleted life table analysis.
SETTING: Summary RRs of all-cause mortality associated with sitting and 
television viewing were obtained from a meta-analysis of available prospective 
cohort studies. Prevalences of sitting and television viewing were obtained from 
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: The estimated gains in life expectancy in the US population were 2.00 
years for reducing excessive sitting to <3 h/day and a gain of 1.38 years from 
reducing excessive television viewing to <2 h/day. The lower and upper limits 
from a sensitivity analysis that involved simultaneously varying the estimates 
of RR (using the upper and lower bounds of the 95% CI) and the prevalence of 
television viewing (±20%) were 1.39 and 2.69 years for sitting and 0.48 and 2.51 
years for television viewing, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Reducing sedentary behaviours such as sitting and television viewing 
may have the potential to increase life expectancy in the USA.

How much of the regional variation in RRT incidence rates within the UK is 
explained by the health needs of the general population?

Castledine CI(1), Gilg JA, Rogers C, Ben-Shlomo Y, Caskey FJ.

Author information:
(1)UK Renal Registry, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK. clarecas@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: Variation in end-stage renal disease treatment rates in the UK 
persist after adjustment for socio-demographic factors.
METHODS: UK-wide ecological study using population socio-demographic factors, 
health status characteristics and access to health services factor in to explain 
the incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT).
RESULTS: There was a 6% higher incidence rate of RRT per standard deviation (SD) 
increase in area diabetes prevalence after adjustment for area level 
socio-economic deprivation status and the proportion of non-white residents 
[incidence rate ratio adjusted (IRR adjusted) 1.06 (95% confidence interval 
1.03,1.09), P < 0.001]. A 3% lower-adjusted RRT incidence rate was seen with 
each SD higher proportion of diabetics achieving an HbA1c of <7.5% [IRR 0.97 
(0.94, 1.00), P = 0.03]. Hypertension prevalence was independently associated 
with an 8% higher RRT incidence rate per SD increase [IRR adjusted 1.08 (1.04, 
1.11), P < 0.001] and an SD increase in life expectancy in an area was 
independently associated with 7% lower RRT incidence rate [IRR adjusted 0.93 
(0.91, 0.96), P < 0.001]. An SD increase in premature cardiovascular (CV) 
mortality rate in an area was also independently associated with RRT incidence 
rates [IRR adjusted 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), P < 0.001]. Rates of coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG)/angioplasty and knee replacement were positively 
associated with RRT incidence, but mammography uptake was not associated. In 
total, 31% of the regional variation in RRT incidence could be explained by 
these factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes prevalence, the proportion of diabetics achieving good 
glycaemic control, hypertension prevalence, life expectancy, premature CV 
mortality, CABG/angioplasty and knee replacement rates were all associated with 
RRT incidence. A third of the regional variation in RRT incidence between areas 
can be explained by these demographic, health and access to health services 
factors.

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced malignancies referred for early clinical trials 
have a short life expectancy. We designed this survey to ascertain the status of 
advance care planning in this population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who were seen in a phase I clinic were asked to 
anonymously complete an investigator-designed survey.
RESULTS: Of 435 individuals approached, 215 (49%) returned completed or 
partially completed surveys, whereas many others stated that they wanted to 
avoid the topic, because they had come to the phase I clinic for cancer therapy. 
Most patients (n = 149; 69%) were still hopeful about their future. 
Approximately 42% of patients (n = 90) reported having a living will, 46% had a 
medical power of attorney (n = 98), and 19% had a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order 
(n = 40). Approximately 20% of participants (n = 43) had not discussed advance 
care planning. Fifty-nine percent of patients wanted to discuss advance care 
planning with their physician. Having a DNR order in place was significantly 
more common in individuals who had a living will and/or a medical power of 
attorney.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients referred to a phase I clinic remained 
optimistic, many had discussed a living will, medical power of attorney, and/or 
DNR order with their physician, family, and/or attorney. However, a significant 
minority had not addressed this issue with anyone, and many refused to take a 
survey on the topic. More than half of the patients wanted to discuss these 
matters with their physician. These observations suggest that extra effort to 
address advance care planning is needed for these patients.

krawinkel@fb09.uni-giessen.de

BACKGROUND: Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) in childhood is caused by 
congenital malformations and inflammatory diseases of the gut. Its reported 
prevalence is 13.7 per million population. Long-term home parenteral nutrition 
has dramatically improved the life expectancy and quality of life of children 
with CIF. The affected children are now treated with parenteral nutrition at 
home as soon as their medical state and family circumstances allow.
METHODS: The authors present data from a patient registry and review 
publications retrieved by a selective literature search.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Children with CIF can now be expected to survive beyond 
adolescence, at the very least, and enjoy good quality of life. This goal can 
only be achieved if nutritional therapy is carried out safely and the affected 
children's development is closely monitored by an interdisciplinary team that 
consists of primary care physicians/family doctors, neonatologists, pediatric 
gastroenterologists, and pediatric surgeons. Moreover, the prevention, early 
detection, and appropriate treatment of complications such as infection, liver 
disease, renal dysfunction, and disturbances of bone metabolism is of vital 
importance. The patients' families must be supported by specially qualified 
ambulatory nurses and social workers. Treatment with parenteral, enteral, and 
oral nutrition and surgery enables most infants with CIF to meet all their 
nutritional needs orally by the time they start going to school. For children 
who suffer from intractable complications, intestinal transplantation provides a 
real and increasing chance of survival.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Diagnosis of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and 
early prediction neurological outcome is important and difficult. The aim of 
this study was to determine the prognostic value of amplitude-integrated 
electroencephalography (aEEG) for abnormal neurodevelopment outcome in a neonate 
with HIE.
METHODS: A total of 90 neonates > 32 gestational age (GA) with HIE were enrolled 
prospectively. All neonates with HIE were categorized into three grades 
according to the Sarnat and Sarnat clinical scoring system (mild HIE, moderate 
HIE and severe HIE). aEEG traces were recorded with a cerebral function monitor 
(CFM) during the first 72 h of life. The neurodevelopment outcome was assessed 
at 12 months of age of corrected gestational age.
RESULTS: The pattern of aEEG correlated with the severity of HIE (p < 0.0001) 
and subsequent neurodevelopment outcome (p < 0.001). We found that aEEG 
background patterns exhibited superior prediction of abnormal outcomes at 12 
months of age (sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 94.3%, positive 
predictive value of 78.6% and negative predictive value of 98.1%) when compared 
to aEEG seizure (sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 48%, positive predictive 
value of 57% and a negative predictive value of 92%). Electroclinical 
dissociation seizure was detected in 28% of the neonates with HIE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that aEEG is simple and accurate bedside 
diagnostic method for assessing extension of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and 
early identification of neonates with perinatal HIE who are at high risk of 
neurodevelopmental impairment.

The beginnings of the Paediatric Cardiac Surgery in the Czech Republic date back 
to the period immediately after the end of World War II. Its protagonists were 
Prof. Emerich Polák from the Surgical Clinic in Prague, Vinohrady, Prof. Jan 
Bedrna from Surgical Clinic in Hradec Kralove, Prof. Vladislav Rapant from 
Surgical Clinic in Olomouc and Prof. Václav Kafka from the Second Surgical 
Clinic in Prague. They started with operations of the patent ductus arteriosus, 
the Blalock-Taussig shunt in cyanotic heart defects and resection of coarctation 
of the aorta. Operations of congenital heart defects, on the open heart were 
elaborated namely by cardiosurgeons in Brno, under the leadership of Professor 
Jan Navrátil. On the extension of those methods participated Professor Jaroslav 
Procházka in Hradec Kralove and Prof. Václav Kafka at the newly opened 
department of Paediatric surgery in Prague. In the next period, attention of 
paediatric cardiac surgery was directed at operations of critical congenital 
heart defects in the smallest children. Palliative operations of the critical 
heart defects in newborns and infants were first introduced at the clinic of 
paediatric surgery of the Paediatric University Hospital in Prague. Radical 
operations of infants and newborns with extra-corporal circulation were 
elaborated in the Children's heart centre in Prague, Motol. Initiative in the 
further development of paediatric cardiac surgery was taken over by the 
Children's heart centre in Prague since its founding in 1977. There was 
concentrated all medical care of children born with a congenital heart defect in 
the Czech Republic. This concentration of specialized care at one institution 
allowed to accumulate extremely large experience with the diagnostics and 
surgical treatment of congenital heart defects in all age groups with the 
decrease of patients mortality after operations to 1% even for the smallest 
children and enabled continuously monitor the quality of life of patients 
treated for congenital heart defect up to adulthood. It was followed by a system 
of care for adults with congenital heart defect in cooperation with cardiac 
surgery departments for adults. Excellent level of paediatric cardiac surgery in 
the Czech Republic is currently confirmed by comparison of the results in the 
global database operations of congenital heart defects, led by the European 
Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS).

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic disorder of hemoglobin causing 
vaso-occlusion. Patients suffer severe anemia, strokes, renal failure, pulmonary 
compromise and shortened life expectancy. Over 90,000 people in the USA have 
SCD, and the options for therapy are limited and only partially effective. With 
the available therapies - hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, hydration and pain 
medicines - patients continue to suffer the long-term complications of the 
disease. This review focuses on the pathogenesis of SCD and the role of fetal 
hemoglobin in disrupting the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin. The authors 
review the compounds that induce fetal hemoglobin: hydroxyurea, which is 
currently US FDA approved, and the histone deacetylase inhibitors and discuss 
their role in the treatment of SCD and other β-hemoglobinopathies.

The impact of antiretroviral treatment on the age composition of the HIV 
epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage is rapidly expanding in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on the effect of ART on survival of HIV-infected 
people and HIV transmission, the age composition of the HIV epidemic in the 
region is expected to change in the coming decades. We quantify the change in 
the age composition of HIV-infected people in all countries in SSA.
METHODS: We used STDSIM, a stochastic microsimulation model, and developed an 
approach to represent HIV prevalence and treatment coverage in 43 countries in 
SSA, using publicly available data. We predict future trends in HIV prevalence 
and total number of HIV-infected people aged 15-49 years and 50 years or older 
for different ART coverage levels.
RESULTS: We show that, if treatment coverage continues to increase at present 
rates, the total number of HIV-infected people aged 50 years or older will 
nearly triple over the coming years: from 3.1 million in 2011 to 9.1 million in 
2040, dramatically changing the age composition of the HIV epidemic in SSA. In 
2011, about one in seven HIV-infected people was aged 50 years or older; in 
2040, this ratio will be larger than one in four.
CONCLUSION: The HIV epidemic in SSA is rapidly ageing, implying changing needs 
and demands in many social sectors, including health, social care, and old-age 
pension systems. Health policymakers need to anticipate the impact of the 
changing HIV age composition in their planning for future capacity in these 
systems.

Antiretroviral therapy adherence and drug-drug interactions in the aging HIV 
population.

Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA. jnachega@jhsph.edu

It is estimated that by 2015 more than half of all HIV-infected individuals in 
the United States will be 50 years of age or older. As this population ages, the 
frequency of non-AIDS related comorbidities increases, which includes 
cardiovascular, metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and psychiatric 
disorders. As a result, medical management of the aging HIV population can be 
complicated by polypharmacy and higher pill burden, leading to poorer 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Adherence to ART is generally better in 
older populations when compared to younger populations; however, cognitive 
impairment in elderly patients can impair adherence, leading to worse treatment 
outcomes. Practical monitoring tools can improve adherence and increase rates of 
viral load suppression. Several antiretroviral drugs exhibit inhibitory and/or 
inducing effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which are responsible for the 
metabolism of many medications used for the treatment of comorbidities in the 
aging HIV population. The combination of ART with polypharmacy significantly 
increases the chance of potentially serious drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which 
can lead to drug toxicity, poorer ART adherence, loss of efficacy of the 
coadministered medication, or virologic breakthrough. Increasing clinicians 
awareness of common DDIs and the use of DDI programs can prevent 
coadministration of potentially harmful combinations in elderly HIV-infected 
individuals. Well designed ART adherence interventions and DDI studies are 
needed in the elderly HIV population.

OBJECTIVES: Limited evidence is available on HIV, aging and comorbidities in 
sub-Saharan Africa. This article describes the prevalence of HIV and chronic 
comorbidities among those aged 50 years and older in South Africa using 
nationally representative data.
DESIGN: The WHO's Study of global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) was conducted 
in South Africa in 2007-2008. SAGE includes nationally representative cohorts of 
persons aged 50 years and older, with comparison samples of those aged 18-49 
years, which aims to study health and its determinants.
METHODS: Logistic and linear regression models were applied to data from 
respondents aged 50 years and older to determine associations between age, sex 
and HIV status and various outcome variables including prevalence of seven 
chronic conditions.
RESULTS: HIV prevalence among adults aged 50 and older in South Africa was 6.4% 
and was particularly elevated among Africans, women aged 50-59 and those living 
in rural areas. Rates of chronic disease were higher among all older adults 
compared with those aged 18-49. Of those aged 50 years and older, 29.6% had two 
or more of the seven chronic conditions compared with 8.8% of those aged 18-49 
years (P < 0.0001). When controlling for age and sex among those aged 50 and 
older, BMI was lower among HIV-infected older adults aged 50 and older (27.5 
kg/m2) than in HIV-uninfected individuals of the same age (30.6) (P < 0.0001). 
Grip strength among HIV-infected older adults was significantly (P=0.004) weaker 
than among similarly-aged HIV-uninfected individuals.
CONCLUSION: HIV-infected older adults in South Africa have high rates of chronic 
disease and weakness. Studies are required to examine HIV diagnostics and 
treatment instigation rates among older adults to ensure equity of access to 
quality care, as the number and percentage of older adults living with HIV is 
likely to increase.

A growing proportion of people living with HIV/AIDS also struggle to cope with 
one or several noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), particularly as they age. The 
two epidemics being intertwined, there is increasing recognition that that there 
should be closer advocacy, policy and programmatic links between HIV and NCDs. 
The objective of this paper is to discuss the development of a research agenda 
geared towards informing the design and implementation of programs and policies 
truly grounded in a co-benefits approach. Tackling the joint epidemics of 
HIV/AIDS and NCDs in Africa will require for research funders and private and 
foreign aid donors to be bold, visionary and to commit to long-term research 
investments in order to evaluate the effects of natural policy experiments and 
complex interventions.

Although health systems in most low-income countries largely provide episodic 
care for acute symptomatic conditions, many HIV programs have developed 
effective, locally owned and contextually appropriate policies, systems and 
tools to support chronic care services for persons living with HIV (PLWH). The 
continuity of care provided by such programs may be especially critical for 
older PLWH, who are at risk for more rapid progression of disease and are more 
likely to have complications of HIV and its treatment than their younger 
counterparts. Older PLWH are also more likely to have other chronic 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including hypertension, diabetes, cancers and 
chronic lung disease. As the number of older PLWH rises, enhanced chronic care 
systems will be required to optimize their health and wellbeing. These systems, 
lessons and resources can also be leveraged to support the burgeoning numbers of 
HIV-negative individuals with chronic NCD in need of ongoing care.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate trends in the HIV epidemic in China, and explore the 
epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of expanded voluntary counseling 
and testing (VCT), antiretroviral treatment (ART), and harm reduction programs 
in preventing the spread of HIV.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A mathematical model was developed and calibrated to reflect 
the dynamics of disease progression and transmission through sexual contacts and 
needle sharing in China, and the cost-effectiveness of four interventions was 
analyzed. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to estimate uncertainty 
ranges for all outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 3.4 million new HIV infections were estimated to occur over 
the next 30 years if no preventive measures were implemented, of which 75% will 
occur in high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users (IDUs) and men who have 
sex with men. Expanding ART treatment is most cost-effective, at 4840 
(uncertainty range/UR: 3960-5980) international dollars per quality-adjusted 
life year gained. The optimal cost-effectiveness path is from ART to the 
combination strategy of ART and harm reduction, followed by the combination 
strategy of harm reduction, ART and VCT.
CONCLUSION: Expanded VCT (low-risk once, high-risk annually), expanded ART, harm 
reduction programs and all combinations of these strategies are cost-effective 
relative to the base case. In order to bring China to a lower phase of the HIV 
epidemic, in addition to VCT and ART treatment, efforts in reducing risk 
behavior will be necessary.

[Polytherapy in cardiovascular prevention: open issues].

[Article in Italian]

Despite the considerable advances in preventive treatment achieved over the last 
two decades, the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease represents an 
urgent need for new therapeutic strategies to reduce cardiovascular mortality 
and morbidity. The current pandemic of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, as a 
result of unhealthy lifestyle and dietary habits together with predisposing 
genetic backgrounds, is the main cause of increased cardiovascular mortality and 
raised overall health expenditure. Despite the growing number of cardiovascular 
prevention campaigns, the control of cardiovascular risk factors remains largely 
unsatisfactory worldwide. Unhealthy lifestyles lead to an increased consumption 
of drugs to achieve target levels of cardiovascular risk factors, namely blood 
pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This phenomenon results in a 
disproportionate increase in the number of cardiovascular drugs, already in the 
early stages of disease. Despite current guidelines encourage combination 
therapies in cardiovascular prevention, the adoption of polytherapy, commonly 
defined as the use of 5 or more drugs, is extremely frequent and is often 
paradoxically unsuccessful due to poor patient education and adherence, 
increased adverse effects and inappropriate drug prescribing. Moreover, 
increased life-expectancy resulting from early treatment of myocardial 
infarction and improved heart failure management has led to an older population 
characterized by an increased prevalence of comorbid conditions. This is a 
further reason for increased prescription of drugs leading to an impairment of 
patient adherence and increased adverse effects. In order to overcome the 
emerging problem of polytherapy, the use of a single "polypill" containing a 
combination of drugs for cardiovascular prevention has been postulated. Such an 
approach is providing promising results in the management of hypertension and 
dyslipidemia. However, available evidence is still preliminary and prospective 
data on cardiovascular outcomes are still lacking. This present article proposes 
a critical analysis of some open issues related to polytherapy in cardiovascular 
prevention.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 21 weeks of strength 
and/or endurance training on health related quality of life (HRQoL) in 39-77 
year-old healthy subjects. 108 men and 96 women were randomized into endurance, 
strength, or combined training groups and controls. Strength-group performed 
high-intensity strength training while endurance-group performed cycle training. 
Combined-group completed both training protocols. Leg extension strength and 
maximal oxygen uptake were measured. HRQoL was assessed with a Finnish version 
of SF-36 questionnaire. A significant training-induced difference was observed 
between groups (p=0.038) in the vitality dimension of HRQoL, which was 
characterized by a 6.6 ± 1.5 unit increase in the combined group and no change 
in the other groups. Both endurance and combined training showed small 
improvements in certain dimensions of HRQoL. Dimensions of general (4.6 ± 1.9) 
and mental health (3.9 ± 1.4) improved in combined-group while general health 
(4.4 ± 2.0), bodily pain (5.5 ± 2.5) and role physical (6.0 ± 2.4) improved in 
endurance-group. Strength-group experienced increased pain ( -5.4 ± 1.8) during 
the experimental period. However, increased perception of pain was not observed 
during combined training. According to the present results both endurance and 
especially combined training may have potential to promote or maintain certain 
dimensions of HRQoL even in middle-aged and older adults.

Real-time PCR has engendered wide acceptance for quantitation of hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) DNA in the blood due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, 
reproducibility, and reduced contamination. Here we describe a cost-effective 
and highly sensitive HBV real-time quantitative assay based on the light upon 
extension real-time PCR platform and a simple and reliable HBV DNA preparation 
method using silica-coated magnetic beads.

Treatment of dyslipidemia in the elderly.

Shao H(1), Chen LQ, Xu J.

Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerosis. Treating 
dyslipidemia in elderly patients requires specific knowledge and understanding 
of common dyslipidemias and the relative safety of various pharmacologic agents 
in the presence of possible multiple comorbidities. Lifestyle modification 
remains the first step in the treatment of dyslipidemia; however, it can be 
difficult to sustain and achieve acceptable compliance in the elderly and it is 
best used in combination with drug therapy. Statins are widely accepted as the 
first-line therapy. Several recent studies have demonstrated that statins are 
safe and effective in the elderly. However, it is important to note that there 
is very limited data regarding the effects of dyslipidemia treatment on 
morbidity and mortality in patients over 85 years of age. In summary, the 
clinicians must recognize that the presence of dyslipidemia in the elderly poses 
substantial risk of coronary events and stroke. The available evidence has 
demonstrated that in most elderly patients who are at increased risk for 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, treatment of dyslipidemia with 
appropriate therapy reduces the risk, and when used carefully with close 
monitoring for safety, the treatment is generally well tolerated. With 
increasing life expectancy, it is critical for physicians to recognize the 
importance of detection and treatment of dyslipidemia in the elderly.

Human female life expectancy is higher than that of males. Intriguingly, it has 
been reported that women display faster rates of age-related cognitive decline 
and a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the molecular 
bases of these contradictory trends, we analyzed differences in expression 
changes with age between adult males and females, in four brain regions. In the 
superior frontal gyrus (SFG), a part of the prefrontal cortex, we observed 
manifest differences between the two sexes in the timing of age-related changes, 
that is, sexual heterochrony. Intriguingly, age-related expression changes 
predominantly occurred earlier, or at a faster pace, in females compared to men. 
These changes included decreased energy production and neural function and 
up-regulation of the immune response, all major features of brain aging. 
Furthermore, we found that accelerated expression changes in the female SFG 
correlated with expression changes observed in AD, as well as stress effects in 
the frontal cortex. Accelerated aging-related changes in the female SFG 
transcriptome may provide a link between a higher stress exposure or sensitivity 
in women and the higher prevalence of AD.

OBJECTIVES: Women with cystic fibrosis (CF) now achieve a greater life 
expectancy and therefore have greater expectations from life. Literature 
reporting pregnancy outcomes in CF is still sparse. There remains a legacy of 
advising women with significant disease to avoid pregnancy. We aimed to assess 
current maternal and fetal outcomes in women with CF with varied pre-pregnancy 
lung function.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case note review of data from 15 pregnancies in 12 
women with CF receiving care at a specialist centre between 2003 and 2011. 
Descriptive statistics were used for the quantitative data. The forced 
expiratory volume (FEV₁) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were calculated and 
shown as the percentage of their predicted values for BMI, height and age. 
Changes in lung function pre, 6, and 24 months post delivery were calculated 
with the paired t-test.
RESULTS: Mean maternal age was 28.9 (range 21-36, CI 26.8-31). Maternal FEV₁ at 
booking ranged from 27 to 80% predicted (mean=63.6%, CI 54.62-71.38%). Cystic 
fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) was present in 8 of 14 (live birth) 
pregnancies. Average gestation at delivery was 38 weeks. There was a 100% 
vaginal delivery rate (11 spontaneous vertex, 2 ventouse, 1 forceps). Average 
fetal birth weight was 2.97 kg (range 2.2-3.83 kg, CI 2.72-3.23). The 
differences between the maternal pre- and 6 months post-pregnancy mean FEV₁ 
(p=0.136) and FVC (p=0.225) were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: With careful multidisciplinary antenatal and intrapartum management, 
successful outcomes have been obtained in this group of women with CF.

Population pharmacokinetic meta-analysis of intranasal fentanyl spray as a means 
to enrich pharmacokinetic information for patients with cancer breakthrough 
pain.

BACKGROUND: The development of intranasal fentanyl (INFS) aimed for a rapid 
treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in cancer patients. The pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of INFS was well characterized in healthy subjects, while PK investigations 
in cancer patients are limited.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop a population PK model for fentanyl in 
volunteers and patients following INFS administration, to evaluate the influence 
of potential covariates and to simulate the exposure of fentanyl after repeated 
dosing in cancer patients.
METHODS: PK data from ten clinical trials were used for model development. The 
final model was validated with nonparametric bootstrap and visual predictive 
check. In addition, the secondary PK parameters (AUC0-tlast, Cmax, tmax) of a 
separate validation data set of INFS were predicted and compared to 
noncompartmental analysis results. Afterwards, repeated dose PK profiles in 
cancer patients were simulated.
RESULTS: Plasma profiles after INFS administration were best described by a 
three-compartment model. Significant covariate relationships were identified for 
naltrexone and oxymetazoline co-treatment. Influences of body weight, BMI, sex 
and cancer patient as subject type were considered not to be clinically 
relevant. PK parameters for subpopulations of cancer patients were derived. 
Steady state simulations revealed that an extension from the current SmPC 
scenario to 6 pain episodes per day would yield similar Cmax values.
CONCLUSIONS: A robust population PK model for INFS was developed. The model 
enhances the understanding of fentanyl PK after INFS dosing in cancer patients 
with BTP, a population for whom real-life data would be very hard to obtain.

Cell intrinsic role of COX-2 in pancreatic cancer development.

COX-2 is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). However, how 
COX-2 promotes PDAC development is unclear. While previous studies have 
evaluated the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition via the use of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in PDAC models, 
none have addressed the cell intrinsic versus microenvironment roles of COX-2 in 
modulating PDAC initiation and progression. We tested the cell intrinsic role of 
COX-2 in PDAC progression using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function 
approaches. Cox-2 deletion in Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells significantly 
delays the development of PDAC in mice with K-ras activation and Pten 
haploinsufficiency. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression promotes early onset and 
progression of PDAC in the K-ras mouse model. Loss of PTEN function is a 
critical factor in determining lethal PDAC onset and overall survival. 
Mechanistically, COX-2 overexpression increases p-AKT levels in the precursor 
lesions of Pdx1(+); K-ras(G12D)(/+); Pten(lox)(/+) mice in the absence of Pten 
LOH. In contrast, Cox-2 deletion in the same setting diminishes p-AKT levels and 
delays cancer progression. These data suggest an important cell intrinsic role 
for COX-2 in tumor initiation and progression through activation of the PI3K/AKT 
pathway. PDAC that is independent of intrinsic COX-2 expression eventually 
develops with decreased FKBP5 and increased GRP78 expression, two alternate 
pathways leading to AKT activation. Together, these results support a cell 
intrinsic role for COX-2 in PDAC development and suggest that while anti-COX-2 
therapy may delay the development and progression of PDAC, mechanisms known to 
increase chemoresistance through AKT activation must also be overcome.

    Spine J. 2012 Aug;12(8):691-2.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Despite the importance of the information provided by 
cost-utility analyses (CUAs), there has been a lack of these types of studies 
performed in the area of spinal care.
PURPOSE: To systematically review cost-utility studies published on spinal care 
between 1976 and 2010.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: All CUAs pertaining to spinal care published between 1976 and 2010 were 
identified using the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) registry database (Tufts 
Medical Center, Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy) and National 
Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). The keywords used to 
search both the registry databases were the following: spine, spinal, neck, 
back, cervical, lumbar, thoracic, and scoliosis. Search of the CEA registry 
provided a total of 28 articles, and the NHS EED yielded an additional 5, all of 
which were included in this review. Each article was reviewed for the study 
subject, methodology, and results. Data contained within the databases for each 
of the 33 articles were recorded, and the manuscripts were reviewed to provide 
insight into the funding source, analysis perspective, discount rate, and 
cost-utility ratios.
RESULTS: There was wide variation among the 33 studies in methodology. There 
were 17 operative, 13 nonoperative, and 3 imaging studies. Study subjects 
included lumbar spine (n=27), cervical spine (n=4), scoliosis (n=1), and lumbar 
and cervical spine (n=1). Twenty-three of the studies were based on the clinical 
data from prospective randomized studies, 7 on decision models, 2 on prospective 
observational data, and 1 on a retrospective case series. Sixty cost-utility 
ratios were reported in the 33 articles. Of the ratios, 19 of 60 (31.6%) were 
cost saving, 27 of 60 (45%) were less than $100,000/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gain, and 14 of 60 (23.3%) were greater than $100,000/QALY gain. Only 
four of 33 (12%) studies contained the four key criteria of cost-effectiveness 
research recommended by the US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and 
Medicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-three CUA studies and 60 cost-utility ratios have been 
published on various aspects of spinal care over the last 30 years. Certain 
aspects of spinal care have been shown to be cost effective. Further efforts, 
however, are needed to better define the value of many aspects of spinal care. 
Future CUA studies should consider societal cost perspective and carefully 
consider the durability of clinical benefit in determining a study time horizon.
