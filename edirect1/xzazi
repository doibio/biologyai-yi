OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide guidelines for evaluation, treatment, and 
genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).
PARTICIPANTS: The group, which comprised 10 experts, including physicians, 
surgeons, and geneticists from international centers, received no corporate 
funding or remuneration.
PROCESS: Guidelines were developed by reviews of peer-reviewed publications; a 
draft was prepared, reviewed, and rigorously revised at several stages; and 
agreed-upon revisions were incorporated.
CONCLUSIONS: MEN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that is due to mutations in 
the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, which encodes a 610-amino acid protein, menin. 
Thus, the finding of MEN1 in a patient has important implications for family 
members because first-degree relatives have a 50% risk of developing the disease 
and can often be identified by MEN1 mutational analysis. MEN1 is characterized 
by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and anterior pituitary 
tumors. Some patients may also develop carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, 
meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, and lipomas. Patients with MEN1 
have a decreased life expectancy, and the outcomes of current treatments, which 
are generally similar to those for the respective tumors occurring in non-MEN1 
patients, are not as successful because of multiple tumors, which may be larger, 
more aggressive, and resistant to treatment, and the concurrence of metastases. 
The prognosis for MEN1 patients might be improved by presymptomatic tumor 
detection and undertaking treatment specific for MEN1 tumors. Thus, it is 
recommended that MEN1 patients and their families should be cared for by 
multidisciplinary teams comprising relevant specialists with experience in the 
diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocrine tumors.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still 
represents an ongoing risk. As a result of septic complications, particularly 
observed with older PCs, the shelf life of PCs has been reduced in Germany to 4 
days. In this study, bacterial screening of PCs by BactiFlow (BF) flow cytometry 
was introduced in three German blood services to evaluate the robustness and 
applicability of the assay. Results were used to discuss the potential for the 
extension of PC shelf life to 5 days.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1956 PCs were tested on days 4 or 5+ after 
PC production using the BF, whereas the BacT/Alert culture system served as 
reference method.
RESULTS: Two PCs were confirmed positive by culture only and were identified as 
Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus species. Two PCs were confirmed 
positive for Streptococcus mitis by BF and culture. Additionally, two PCs were 
culture-positive only in one culture bottle (aerobic: S. mitis and anaerobic: S. 
hominis). Retrospective analysis of bacterial growth kinetics provide the 
indication that corresponding bacterial titres were most likely below the BF 
analytical detection limit (<150 CFU mL(-1) ) and had probably no transfusion 
relevance. All remaining specimens were tested negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing of PCs by BF was successfully implemented. The BF proved 
sufficient as a rapid screening method to improve PC safety. This study further 
provides data supporting the extension of PC shelf life to 5 days after negative 
BF testing on day 4.

INTRODUCTION: Fibromyalgia (FM) is the most common cause of chronic widespread 
body pain in humans. Co-morbidities include sleep disturbance, fatigue, impaired 
physical functioning, altered mood and negative effects on health-related 
quality of life. Pregabalin inhibits presynaptic release of pronociceptive 
neurotransmitters in the CNS; this likely underpins its therapeutic benefit in 
patients with FM.
AREAS COVERED: This review addresses pregabalin pharmacokinetics, efficacy and 
adverse event (AE) profiles from randomized controlled trials and open-label 
extension studies in patients with FM. These effects are compared with those of 
the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, duloxetine and milnacipran 
that also have FDA approval for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
EXPERT OPINION: At the approved dosages, oral pregabalin has at most a moderate 
therapeutic benefit above placebo with tolerable side-effects, in no more than 
50% of patients with FM. Durability of clinically meaningful (≥ 30%) pain relief 
in pregabalin-responders has been demonstrated for at least 6-months, but 
longer-term studies are required as most patients have symptoms for decades. 
Exclusion of patients with common co-morbidities from the pregabalin RCTs in FM 
raises questions on the generalizability of the RCT findings to the typical 
patient seen in clinical practice and so additional investigation is required.

OBJECT: Acromegaly, a syndrome of excess growth hormone (GH) secretion typically 
caused by a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma, reduces life expectancy by 
approximately 10 years when left untreated. Treatment of acromegaly involves 
combinations of one or more discrete therapeutic modalities to achieve 
biochemical control. Unfortunately, data capable of informing decisions among 
alternate management strategies are presently lacking.
METHODS: The authors performed a comparative effectiveness research (CER) review 
integrating efficacy, cost, and quality of life (QOL) analysis for treatment 
strategies comprising various combinations of surgery, radiotherapy, 
stereotactic radiosurgery, and pharmacotherapy in patients with acromegaly 
caused by a pituitary microadenoma. A management decision tree was used to 
identify 5 treatment strategies, each with up to 4 potential treatment steps. 
Efficacy was assessed using recent literature reports of biochemical control 
rates for each modality. Cost estimations were derived from wholesale drug 
prices and from the Healthcare Cost and Utility Project. Quality of life data 
were obtained from studies utilizing the Acromegaly Quality of Life 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Individual treatment modalities were analyzed and ranked in each of 3 
domains: highest rate of success, lowest cost, and highest QOL, and these scores 
were combined to facilitate comparison of overall effectiveness of each of the 
management strategies. These aggregate effectiveness scores were used to compare 
the 5 strategies from the decision tree, and a novel strategy was also proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of management strategy must be individualized for each 
patient with acromegaly. This CER analysis provides a comprehensive framework to 
inform clinical decisions among alternate management strategies in patients with 
GH-secreting pituitary microadenomas.

BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis of hemophilia B, at present, requires multiple infusions 
of human factor (F)IX concentrates per week. A FIX molecule with a prolonged 
half-life has the potential to greatly improve the convenience of, and adherence 
to, prophylaxis.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of our studies was to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of a recombinant fusion protein linking 
coagulation FIX with albumin (rIX-FP).
METHODS: Cynomolgus monkeys and hemophilia B dogs received single intravenous 
doses of rIX-FP (50-500 IU kg(-1)). rIX-FP plasma levels were determined by an 
activity-based assay (dogs only) and anti-FIX ELISA methods. Additionally, 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was determined in hemophilia B 
dogs. Data were compared with a direct study comparator (recombinant FIX [rFIX]) 
or previously published data.
RESULTS: The terminal half-life of rIX-FP was prolonged in both species compared 
with FIX reference data. In hemophilia B dogs, human FIX antigen levels remained 
above 0.05 IU mL(-1) more than three times longer after rIX-FP (7.3 days) 
compared with rFIX (2.3 days), whereas respective calculations based on activity 
levels confirmed the observed superior profile. Prolonged PDs of rIX-FP were 
demonstrated with APTT<60 s sustained around four times longer with rIX-FP (5.9 
days) than rFIX (1.5 days).
CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that the recombinant albumin fusion 
technology successfully improves the PK profile of FIX. Clinical studies will 
test whether the improved kinetics result in a significant half-life extension 
in patients with hemophilia B.

Comparison of 2 expandable stents for malignant esophageal disease: a randomized 
controlled trial.

Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) provide effective palliation in 
patients with malignant dysphagia. However, although life expectancy is 
generally limited, reintervention rates because of stent dysfunction are 
significant. New SEMSs are being designed to overcome this drawback.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the results of SEMS placement could be 
improved with a new SEMS design.
PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with dysphagia or leakage caused by malignant 
esophageal disease.
METHODS: In a multicenter randomized clinical trial, consecutive patients with 
dysphagia or leakage because of malignant esophageal disease were randomized to 
placement of a conventional stent or the new stent. Patients were followed up by 
scheduled telephone calls 1 and 3 months after SEMS insertion.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients (73% male; median age, 67 years [range, 40-92 
years]) were included. One patient refused follow-up. Technical success was 100% 
in both groups. The reintervention rate was 15/40 (38%) for the conventional 
stent and 4/39 (10%) for the new stent (P = .004). Major complications, 
including aspiration pneumonia and bleeding, occurred more frequently with the 
conventional stent (10/40, 25%) than with the new stent (3/39, 8%, P = .04). 
There was no difference in overall survival between the 2 groups.
LIMITATIONS: Inclusion of patients with a perforation or fistula.
CONCLUSIONS: The conventional stent and the new stent were equally effective in 
the relief of malignant dysphagia and sealing fistulae. The conventional stent 
was associated with more stent dysfunction and a significantly higher rate of 
major complications. Patients treated with the new stent also needed 
significantly fewer reinterventions than did those treated with a conventional 
stent. This sets the preference for the new stent over the conventional stent 
for patients with malignant esophageal disease.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article is to review existing research on the 
prevalence and etiology of dry mouth in the vulnerable elders and identify 
knowledge gaps.
STUDY DESIGN: Vulnerable elders (VE) are persons aged >65 years who have any or 
all of the following: limited mobility, limited resources, or complex health 
status. A systematic search was conducted of PubMed sources from 1989 to May 
2010. Evidence was evaluated on the prevalence and etiology of xerostomia and 
salivary gland hypofunction (SGH) in VE.
RESULTS: The search identified 1,422 publications. The inclusion/exclusion 
criteria yielded 348 articles, 80 of which are cited herein.
CONCLUSIONS: Research has showed a high prevalence of xerostomia and SGH in VE. 
Common etiologies include medications, poor general health, female gender, and 
age. Gaps still exist in the evaluation of dry mouth in VE. Nonetheless, oral 
dryness will remain an important health issue as life expectancy increases.

Screening for subclinical diseases does not seem to provide much benefit to 
older patients. In fact, screening programmes in the frail elderly may do even 
more harm than good. They often do not profit from such interventions, because 
they have less physiological reserve, greater comorbidity and a shorter life 
expectancy. But not all older people are frail and the population of the elderly 
is very heterogeneous. We propose a screening model to stratify older adults 
into relatively homogeneous groups based on their frailty and health-related 
needs in order to design efficient care and services for all segments.

Revisiting the timing hypothesis: biomarkers that define the therapeutic window 
of estrogen for stroke.

Significantly extended life expectancy coupled with contemporary sedentary 
lifestyles and poor nutrition has created a global epidemic of cardiovascular 
disease and stroke. For women, this issue is complicated by the discrepant 
outcomes of hormone therapy (HT) for stroke incidence and severity as well as 
the therapeutic complications for stroke associated with advancing age. Here we 
propose that the impact of estrogen therapy cannot be considered in isolation, 
but should include age-related changes in endocrine, immune, and nucleic acid 
mediators that collaborate with estrogen to produce neuroprotective effects 
commonly seen in younger, healthier demographics. Due to their role as 
modulators of ischemic cell death, the post-stroke inflammatory response, and 
neuronal survival and regeneration, this review proposes that Insulin-like 
Growth Factor (IGF)-1, Vitamin D, and discrete members of the family of 
non-coding RNA peptides called microRNAs (miRNAs) may be crucial biochemical 
markers that help determine the neuroprotective "window" of HT. Specifically, 
IGF-1 confers neuroprotection in concert with, and independently of, estrogen 
and failure of the insulin/IGF-1 axis is associated with metabolic disturbances 
that increase the risk for stroke. Vitamin D and miRNAs regulate and complement 
IGF-1 mediated function and neuroprotective efficacy via modulation of IGF-1 
availability and neural stem cell and immune cell proliferation, differentiation 
and secretions. Together, age-related decline of these factors differentially 
affects stroke risk, severity, and outcome, and may provide a novel therapeutic 
adjunct to traditional HT practices.

Clinical outcome after laparoscopic radical excision of endometriosis and 
laparoscopic segmental bowel resection.

University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the clinical outcome after laparoscopic radical 
excision of deeply infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) with colorectal extension 
and laparoscopic segmental bowel resection.
RECENT FINDINGS: In three different studies including mostly patients with 
recurrent DIE with colorectal extension, we showed that radical reconstructive 
CO2 laser laparoscopic resection of DIE with colorectal extension in a 
multidisciplinary setting resulted in a low complication rate, a low cumulative 
reintervention and recurrence rate and a high cumulative pregnancy rate, also 
when bowel resection reanastomosis was performed. In a systematic review to 
assess the clinical outcome of surgical treatment of DIE with colorectal 
involvement, data were reported in such a way that comparison of different 
surgical techniques was not possible. A checklist is proposed to achieve 
standardized reporting of presenting symptoms, preoperative tests, inclusion 
criteria, preoperative and postoperative care, complications, follow-up, 
patient-centered assessment of pain and quality of life, fertility and 
recurrence corrected for postoperative use of hormonal suppression or 
infertility treatment.
SUMMARY: CO2 laser laparoscopic radical excision of DIE with colorectal 
extension and laparoscopic segmental bowel resection in centers of expertise is 
associated with good clinical outcome. To make real progress, international 
agreement is needed on terms and definitions used in surgical endometriosis 
research.

Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan. fumiko-k@mvf.biglobe.ne.jp

The utility value was compared among 3 surgical interventions, and the validity 
of the time trade-off (TTO) method was evaluated by analyzing the correlations 
of the utility value with the results of the Visual Function Questionnaire-14 
(VF-14) and other variables. The subjects were 127 patients aged 40-85 years who 
were surgically treated between January 2008 and March 2010, including 26 
patients with glaucoma, 50 with cataracts, and 51 with comitant strabismus. The 
scores on VF-14 and utility values determined using TTO were calculated 
retrospectively. The mean value (SD) of the utility gain was 0.096 (0.105) for 
glaucoma, 0.101 (0.105) for comitant strabismus, and 0.167 (0.237) for 
unilateral and 0.245 (0.167) for bilateral cataracts, indicating significant 
postoperative improvements in the utility value. A significant correlation was 
observed between the utility value and the postoperative VF-14 scores of the 
bilateral cataracts, and the postoperative visual acuity of the better eye of 
the unilateral cataract. The mean value of the quality-adjusted life years was 
2.181 for bilateral and 1.424 for unilateral cataracts, 1.132 for strabismus, 
and 0.870 for glaucoma with an annual discount rate of 3%. The gain of utility 
value was highest in bilateral cataracts, and lowest in glaucoma, and thus the 
TTO analysis was considered to be highly valid for cataract surgery.

INTRODUCTION: The majority of traffic safety policies are limited to preventing 
mortality. However, non-fatal injuries also impose a significant risk of adverse 
health. Therefore, both mortality and morbidity outcomes should be included in 
the evaluation of traffic safety policies. The authors propose a method to 
evaluate different policy options taking into account both fatalities and 
serious injuries.
METHODS: A health impact model was developed and aligned with a transport and 
road safety model, calculating the health impact of fatalities and seriously 
injured traffic victims for two transport scenarios in Flanders and Brussels 
(Belgium): a base scenario and a fuel price increase of 20% as an alternative. 
Victim counts were expressed as disability adjusted life years, using a 
combination of police and medical data. Seriously injured victims were assigned 
an injury, using injury distributions derived from hospital data, to estimate 
the resulting health impact from each crash. Health impact of fatalities was 
taken as the remaining life expectancy at the moment of the fatal crash.
RESULTS: The fuel price scenario resulted in a decrease of health impact due to 
fatalities of 5.53%--5.85% and 3.37%--3.88% for severe injuries. This decrease 
was however not equal among all road users.
CONCLUSIONS: With this method, the impact of traffic polices can be evaluated on 
both mortality and morbidity, while taking into account the variability of 
different injuries following a road crash. This model however still 
underestimates the impact due to non-fatal injuries.

Intensive care units and well-qualified medical staff are indispensable for the 
proper functioning of every hospital facility. Due to demographic changes and 
technological progress having extended the average life expectancy, the number 
of patients hospitalized in intensive care units increases every year [9,10]. 
Global shortages of nursing staff (including changes in their age structure) 
have triggered a debate on the working environment and workload the nursing 
staff are exposed to while performing their duties. This paper provides a 
critical review of selected methods for the measurement of the workload of 
intensive care nurses and points out their practical uses. The paper reviews 
Polish and foreign literature on workload and the measurement tools used to 
evaluate workload indicators.

Deriving benefit of early detection from biomarker-based prognostic models.

Many prognostic models for cancer use biomarkers that have utility in early 
detection. For example, in prostate cancer, models predicting disease-specific 
survival use serum prostate-specific antigen levels. These models typically show 
that higher marker levels are associated with poorer prognosis. Consequently, 
they are often interpreted as indicating that detecting disease at a lower 
threshold of the biomarker is likely to generate a survival benefit. However, 
lowering the threshold of the biomarker is tantamount to early detection. For 
survival benefit to not be simply an artifact of starting the survival clock 
earlier, we must account for the lead time of early detection. It is not known 
whether the existing prognostic models imply a survival benefit under early 
detection once lead time has been accounted for. In this article, we investigate 
survival benefit implied by prognostic models where the predictor(s) of 
disease-specific survival are age and/or biomarker level at disease detection. 
We show that the benefit depends on the rate of biomarker change, the lead time, 
and the biomarker level at the original date of diagnosis as well as on the 
parameters of the prognostic model. Even if the prognostic model indicates that 
lowering the threshold of the biomarker is associated with longer 
disease-specific survival, this does not necessarily imply that early detection 
will confer an extension of life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The Time Trade-Off (TTO) is a widely used instrument for valuing 
preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The TTO reveals 
preferences for own current health ('utilities') on a scale anchored between 
death (0) and perfect health (1). Limited information on the external validity 
of the TTO is available. Aim of this pilot study was to examine the construct 
validity of both an interview TTO and a computer-based TTO in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Thirty patients visiting the outpatient rheumatology clinic 
participated. Construct validity was assessed by measuring convergent and 
discriminative validity. Convergent validity was assessed by calculating 
Spearman's correlations between the utilities obtained from the TTOs and pain, 
general health (rating scales), health-related quality of life (SF-36 and SF-6D) 
and functional status (HAQ-DI). Discriminative power of both TTO measures was 
determined by comparing median utilities between worse and better health 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Correlations of both TTO measures with HRQoL, general health, pain and 
functional status were poor (absolute values ranging from .05 to .26). Both TTOs 
appeared to have no discriminative value among groups of RA patients who had a 
worse or better health status defined by six health outcome measures. About 
one-third of respondents were zero-traders on each of the TTO measures. After 
excluding zero-traders from analysis, the correlations improved considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the interview TTO and computer TTO showed poor construct 
validity in RA patients when using measures of HRQol, general health, pain and 
functional status as reference measures. Possibly, the validity of the TTO 
improves when using an anchor that is more realistic to RA patients than the 
anchor 'death'.

Lost productivity due to premature mortality in developed and emerging 
countries: an application to smoking cessation.

BACKGROUND: Researchers and policy makers have determined that accounting for 
productivity costs, or "indirect costs," may be as important as including direct 
medical expenditures when evaluating the societal value of health interventions. 
These costs are also important when estimating the global burden of disease. The 
estimation of indirect costs is commonly done on a country-specific basis. 
However, there are few studies that evaluate indirect costs across countries 
using a consistent methodology.
METHODS: Using the human capital approach, we developed a model that estimates 
productivity costs as the present value of lifetime earnings (PVLE) lost due to 
premature mortality. Applying this methodology, the model estimates productivity 
costs for 29 selected countries, both developed and emerging. We also provide an 
illustration of how the inclusion of productivity costs contributes to an 
analysis of the societal burden of smoking. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken 
to assess productivity costs on the basis of the friction cost approach.
RESULTS: PVLE estimates were higher for certain subpopulations, such as men, 
younger people, and people in developed countries. In the case study, 
productivity cost estimates from our model showed that productivity loss was a 
substantial share of the total cost burden of premature mortality due to 
smoking, accounting for over 75 % of total lifetime costs in the United States 
and 67 % of total lifetime costs in Brazil. Productivity costs were much lower 
using the friction cost approach among those of working age.
CONCLUSIONS: Our PVLE model is a novel tool allowing researchers to incorporate 
the value of lost productivity due to premature mortality into economic analyses 
of treatments for diseases or health interventions. We provide PVLE estimates 
for a number of emerging and developed countries. Including productivity costs 
in a health economics study allows for a more comprehensive analysis, and, as 
demonstrated by our illustration, can have important effects on the results and 
conclusions.

The objective of this study was to evaluate parents' versus children's level of 
decision making in regards to healthy eating and physical activity practices and 
how it relates to weight status. Cross-sectional parent responses to a series of 
visual analog items assessed the level of both parent and child involvement in 
decisions related to nutrition and physical activity. Participants included 
parent-kindergarten student cohorts in West Virginia from 2007 to 2009 (n=634). 
Mean nutrition and physical activity decision making scores were compared across 
four groups of parent and child weight status combinations. The results 
indicated that parents described equal involvement of the parent and child in 
nutrition and activity decisions within the home. Within families where the 
parent and/or the child were obese, parents reported more involvement of the 
child in nutritional decisions. Families with an obese parent and an obese child 
reported the highest level of child involvement in these types of decisions. In 
summary, this study found that families share involvement in decisions but 
greater child involvement may be associated with adult and/or child obesity. At 
least for younger children, decisions may prove healthier if parents have an 
equal or greater amount of input in the decisions related to healthy lifestyle 
choices.

PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis reduces life expectancy and decreases 
patients' well-being. We sought to assess the determinants of health and 
functional status and estimate the proportion of remaining life that CRC 
survivors would spend in good health.
METHODS: Using Sullivan method, healthy life expectancy was calculated based on 
survival data of 14,849 CRC survivors within a population-based cancer registry 
in southern Netherlands and quality of life information among a random sample of 
these survivors (n = 1,291).
RESULTS: Overall, albeit short life expectancy (LE at age 50 = 12 years for 
males and 13 years for females), most CRC survivors spent a large proportion of 
their remaining life in good health (74 and 77 %, for males and females, 
respectively). Long-term survivors may expect to live a normal life span (LE at 
age 50 = 30 years) and spent a large proportion of the remaining life in good 
health (78 %). In distinction, those with stage IV CRC had less than 2 years to 
live and spent more than half of their remaining life in poor health.
CONCLUSIONS: Most CRC patients may expect no compromise on living a healthy 
life, underlining the importance of early detection. On the other hand, the high 
proportion of non-healthy years among stage IV CRC survivors confirms the 
importance of early detection and palliative care.

AIMS: Patients with atrial fibrillation have a significantly increased risk of 
thromboembolic events such as ischaemic stroke, and patients are therefore 
recommended to be treated with anticoagulation treatment. The most commonly used 
anticoagulant consists of vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin. A new oral 
anticoagulation treatment, dabigatran, has recently been approved for stroke 
prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study 
was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran as preventive treatment of 
stroke and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin in 65-year-old patients 
with atrial fibrillation in Sweden.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision analytic simulation model was used to estimate 
the long-term (20-year) costs and effects of the different treatments. The 
outcome measures are the number of strokes prevented, life years gained, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs and effect data are adjusted 
to a Swedish setting. Patients below 80 years of age are assumed to start with 
dabigatran 150 mg twice a day and switch to 110 mg twice a day at the age of 80 
years due to higher bleeding risk. The price of dabigatran in Sweden is €2.82 
(Swedish kronor 25.39) per day for both doses. The cost per QALY gained for 
dabigatran compared with warfarin is estimated at €7742, increasing to €12 449 
if dabigatran is compared with only well-controlled warfarin treatment.
CONCLUSION: Dabigatran is a cost-effective treatment in Sweden, as its 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the normally accepted willingness 
to pay limit.

A left-to-right shunting patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common congenital 
heart defect in dogs. If it is left uncorrected, life expectancy in most cases 
is decreased due to the development of left-sided congestive heart failure. The 
aim of this study was to describe the dogs diagnosed with PDA in the Utrecht 
University Companion Animal Clinic from 2003 to 2011. The medical records of 102 
patients were retrieved, and the clinical presentation and outcome of PDA 
closure by surgical ligation or transarterial catheter occlusion (TCO) were 
reviewed. In the TCO group, the result of coiling was compared with the 
placement of an Amplatz Canine Duct Occluder (ACDO). A predisposition to PDA was 
found in the German Brak, Stabyhoun, and Schapendoes. Dogs treated with surgical 
ligation were significantly older and heavier than those treated with TCO; 
within the TCO group, dogs treated with ACDO were significantly older and 
heavier The initial success rate (complete disappearance of the audible murmur 
in a patient that survived the procedure) was not significantly different 
between the different treatment modalities. Major complications were more common 
with surgical ligation, but the incidence of minor complications was not 
significantly different. There was no diference in survival between dogs treated 
with surgical ligation and dogs treated with TCO. This study shows a previously 
unreported predisposition to PDA in certain breeds. Both surgical ligation and 
TCO are suitable techniques for PDA closure, although major complications were 
more common with surgical ligation. ACDO appears to be the method with the least 
complications and thus can be considered the safest method.

Combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone as an induction regimen for 
primary central nervous system lymphoma: a decision analysis.

In immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, 
combined modality therapy (CMT) using high-dose methotrexate and whole brain 
radiotherapy has improved response rates compared to chemotherapy alone. The 
trade-off is delayed and potentially devastating treatment-related 
neurotoxicity. A Markov decision-analytic model compared CMT to chemotherapy 
alone in patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Baseline probabilities were derived 
from a systematic literature review. Outcomes were life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. Sensitivity analyses were performed. The life 
expectancy was 2·69 years for CMT and 2·77 years for chemotherapy alone. The 
quality-adjusted life expectancies for the two strategies were 1·70 and 1·67 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) respectively. In younger patients <60 years 
of age, CMT yielded a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 2·71 QALYs, compared 
to 2·09 QALYs for chemotherapy alone, yielding an expected benefit with CMT of 
0·62 QALYs or 7·4 quality-adjusted months. There was no difference between the 
strategies in the older group. The model was robust to key variables for the 
younger group. The preferred induction strategy for younger patients appears to 
be CMT, maximizing life expectancy, and QALYs. This analysis confirms that the 
preferred strategy for older patients is chemotherapy alone.

Dabigatran etexilate: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

McKeage K(1).

Author information:
(1)demail@springer.com

This article provides an overview of the clinical profile of oral dabigatran 
etexilate (Pradaxa®, Pradax™) [hereafter referred to as dabigatran] when used 
for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation (AF), followed by a review of cost-utility analyses of 
dabigatran in this patient population. Dabigatran (110 or 150 mg twice daily) 
demonstrated noninferiority versus adjusted-dose warfarin with regard to the 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (primary endpoint) in patients with 
AF in the RE-LY trial, and the 150 mg twice-daily dosage was significantly more 
effective than warfarin for this endpoint, as well as most other efficacy 
endpoints. The incidence of major bleeding was generally similar in patients 
receiving dabigatran 150 mg twice daily or warfarin, but was lower in patients 
receiving dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. With regard to other bleeding 
endpoints, dabigatran was generally associated with lower rates than warfarin, 
except for gastrointestinal major bleeding. Dabigatran (both dosages) was 
associated with a higher incidence of dyspepsia than warfarin. Results of 
modelled cost-utility analyses from several countries from the perspective of a 
healthcare payer over a lifetime (or 20-year) time horizon and primarily based 
on data from the RE-LY trial were generally consistent. All but one analysis 
demonstrated that twice-daily dabigatran 150 mg (or age-adjusted, sequential 
dosing) was cost effective with regard to the incremental cost per QALY gained 
relative to adjusted-dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism in AF patients, as the results were below generally accepted 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. In contrast, the incremental cost per QALY gained 
for dabigatran 110 mg twice daily versus warfarin exceeded cost-effectiveness 
thresholds in all studies except one. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the 
cost utility of dabigatran versus warfarin was generally robust to variations in 
the majority of parameters. However, the incremental cost per QALY gained for 
dabigatran versus warfarin improved when levels of international normalized 
ratio control in warfarin recipients decreased and when the baseline level of 
risk of stroke increased.

Dynamic lumbar curvature measurement in acute and chronic low back pain 
sufferers.

London, UK. jwilliams@bournemouth.ac.uk

OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine the reliability of a novel fiber-optic method to 
dynamically measure lumbar curvature in low back pain (LBP) sufferers, and (2) 
to investigate the dynamic lumbar curvature in acute and chronic LBP sufferers.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Physiotherapy clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Acute (n=20) and chronic (n=20) LBP sufferers recruited from 
general practitioner and therapist referrals.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A fiber-optic device was used to measure curvature 
through time during flexion, lifting, and extension movements. Repeated-measures 
reliability for curvature-time curves was tested using coefficients of multiple 
correlation (CMCs) and root mean square error, and for peak curvature values 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and mean absolute errors were used. 
Acute and chronic LBP groups were compared using peak curvatures and sequencing 
of curvature change.
RESULTS: The fiber-optic method was shown to be highly reliable in measuring 
both whole lumbar and lower lumbar curvature with CMC values >.81 and ICC values 
>.99. Chronic LBP sufferers displayed greater peak curvatures during flexion and 
lifting for the whole lumbar spine and lifting for the lower lumbar spine. The 
sequencing behavior demonstrated that the quartile of movement associated with 
the greatest curvature change was the second for flexion and lifting and first 
and second for extension across both groups. No significant differences in 
sequencing were demonstrated between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This method is reliable for dynamic lumbar curvature measurement in 
back pain sufferers and is a viable option for clinicians. Acute LBP sufferers 
display less kyphosis during flexion and lifting. Sequencing of curvature change 
is similar across the 2 groups.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a reduced life 
expectancy due to increased cardiovascular disease. The lack of a suitable 
animal model resembling both RA and atherosclerosis has hindered studies 
demonstrating a direct link between systemic inflammation in RA and the 
development of atherosclerosis. Our objective was to overcome this barrier by 
generating an animal model (K/BxA(g7)) that spontaneously develops both RA-like 
disease and atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Arthritis severity was evaluated using clinical indices and 
immunohistochemical staining of ankle joint specimens. Aortic atherosclerosis 
was delineated via Sudan IV staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Serum 
cholesterol and lipoprotein levels were measured using enzymatic assays. Serum 
levels of cytokines, chemokines and adipokines were determined by Luminex 
assays.
RESULTS: K/BxA(g7) mice developed a destructive arthropathy followed by 
prominent aortic atherosclerosis. These animals also displayed dyslipidaemia, 
characterised by reduced serum levels of total cholesterol and high-density 
lipoprotein, and increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/vLDL compared with 
control mice. Further, there were higher levels of circulating inflammatory 
mediators, such as interleukin-6, sRANKL and CCL5 in atherosclerotic K/BxA(g7) 
mice compared with controls. Treatment with etanercept reduced arthritis and 
atherosclerosis development in K/BxA(g7) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: K/BxA(g7) mice recapitulate the same sequence of events occurring 
in patients with RA, namely an erosive, inflammatory arthritis followed by 
atherosclerosis. These data suggest that the K/BxA(g7) mouse is a novel system 
for investigating the interplay between systemic inflammation occurring in RA 
and the development of atherosclerosis.

Early-stage embryos must reshape the tissues of which they are made into organs 
and other life-sustaining structures; and if non-mammalian embryos fail to 
complete these tasks before the energy provided by their yolk runs out, they 
die. The aim of this study is to use a cell-level computational model to 
investigate the energetic cost of a variety of mechanisms that can drive an 
in-plane reshaping pattern known as convergent extension--a motif in which a 
tissue narrows in one in-plane direction and expands in another. Mechanisms 
considered include oriented lamellipodia, directed mitosis, stress fibers, and 
anisotropic external tension. Both isolated patches of tissue and actively 
contracting tissues that deform adjacent passive areas are considered. The 
cell-level finite element model used here assumes that the cell membrane and its 
associated proteins generate a net tension γ along each cell-cell interface and 
that the cytoplasm and its embedded networks and structures have an effective 
viscosity μ. Work costs are based exclusively on mechanical considerations such
