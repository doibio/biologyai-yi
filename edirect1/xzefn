of CT, no significant radiation dose penalty was observed with a reduction in 
mean annual CED, primarily due to the influence of CT dose reduction strategies.

Objective: To analyze the disease burden of pneumoconiosis globally and in China 
from 1990 to 2019 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data, and to provide 
a theoretical basis for prevention and control of pneumoconiosis. Methods: In 
September 2022, the data of incidence, prevalence, morality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of pneumoconiosis and its subtypes 
globally and in China from 1990 to 2019 were collected from GBD 2019, including 
absolute number and age-standardized rate (ASR). Joinpoint linear regression 
model was used to calculate average annual percent change (AAPC) and analyze the 
change trends of incidence, prevalence, mortality and DALY of pneumoconiosis and 
its subtypes. Results: From 1990 to 2019, the incident cases, prevalent cases 
and DALY value of pneumoconiosis showed upward trends, while the number of death 
cases showed downward trends. And the ASR of incidence (ASIR), the ASR of 
prevalence (ASPR), the ASR of mortality (ASMR) and the ASR of DALY (ASDR) showed 
downward trends globally and in China. China accounted for a large proportion of 
the global disease burden of penumoconiosis, accounting for more than 67% of the 
incident cases, more than 80% of the prevalent cases, more than 43% of the 
deaths cases and more than 60% of the absolute number of DALY in the world every 
year. Male were the main population of pneumoconiosis disease burden globally 
and in China, and the age of onset was earlier than that of female. The peak age 
periods of incidence, prevalence, mortality and DALY of pneumoconiosis globally 
and in China from 1990 to 2019 have increased. Silicosis was still the type with 
the highest disease burden of pneumoconiosis globally and in China. The disease 
burden of coal workers' pneumoconiosis had an overall improvement trend, but 
asbestosis had an increasing disease burden worldwide. Conclusion: The disease 
burden of pneumoconiosis is heavy globally and in China, which is necessary to 
strengthen the supervision and prevention measures according to gender, age and 
etiological types.

Publisher: 目的： 利用2019年全球疾病负担数据库（GBD）数据，分析1990至2019年全球和中国尘肺病的疾病负担，为尘肺病防控提供理论依据。 
方法： 于2022年9月，收集整理GBD 
2019中1990至2019年全球和中国尘肺病及不同类型尘肺病的发病、患病、死亡病例数与伤残调整寿命年（DALY）绝对值，并获取相应的年龄标准化率（ASR）。运用Joinpoint线性回归模型计算尘肺病及各类型尘肺病发病、患病、死亡和DALY 
ASR的平均年度变化百分比（AAPC）值，分析变化趋势。 结果： 
1990至2019年，全球和中国尘肺病的发病、患病例数与DALY绝对值均呈上升趋势，死亡病例数呈下降趋势，年龄标准化发病率（ASIR）、年龄标准化患病率（ASPR）、年龄标准化死亡率（ASMR）和年龄标准化DALY率（ASDR）均呈下降趋势。中国尘肺病在全球尘肺病疾病负担中占比较大，每年度新发病例数占全球67%以上，患病例数占80%以上，死亡例数占43%以上，DALY绝对值占60%以上。男性是全球及中国尘肺病疾病负担的主要人群，较女性发病年龄早。1990至2019年全球及中国尘肺病发病、患病、死亡及DALY高峰年龄段存在增大趋势。矽肺仍是全球及中国尘肺病疾病负担最重的尘肺病类型，煤工尘肺疾病负担总体存在改善趋势，但石棉肺在全球范围内存在疾病负担加重趋势。 
结论： 全球和中国尘肺病的疾病负担沉重，需根据性别、年龄及病因类型进一步针对性强化监管及防治对策。.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a life-long disease that poses a serious threat to safety 
and health. We aimed to assess the disease burden attributable to diabetes 
globally and by different subgroups, and to predict future disease burden using 
statistical models.
METHODS: This study was divided into three stages. Firstly, we evaluated the 
disease burden attributable to diabetes globally and by different subgroups in 
2019. Second, we assessed the trends from 1990 to 2019. We estimated the annual 
percentage change of disease burden by applying a linear regression model. 
Finally, the age-period-cohort model was used to predict the disease burden from 
2020 to 2044. Sensitivity analysis was performed with time-series models.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of incidence cases of diabetes globally was 
22239396 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 20599519-24058945). The number of 
prevalence cases was 459875371 (95% UI 423474244-497980624) the number of deaths 
cases was 1551170 (95% UI 1445555-1650675) and the number of disability-adjusted 
life years cases was 70880155 (95% UI 59707574-84174005). The disease burden was 
lower in females than males and increased with age. The disease burden 
associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus was greater than that with type 1; the 
burden also varied across different socio-demographic index regions and 
different countries. The global disease burden of diabetes increased 
significantly over the past 30 years and will continue to increase in the 
future.
CONCLUSION: The disease burden of diabetes contributed significantly to the 
global disease burden. It is important to improve treatment and diagnosis to 
halt the growth in disease burden.

Diabetes mellitus is still expanding globally and is epidemic in developing 
countries. The combat of this plague has caused enormous economic and social 
burdens related to a lowered quality of life in people with diabetes. Despite 
recent significant improvements of life expectancy in patients with diabetes, 
there is still a need for efforts to elucidate the complexities and mechanisms 
of the disease processes to overcome this difficult disorder. To this end, the 
use of appropriate animal models in diabetes studies is invaluable for 
translation to humans and for the development of effective treatment. In this 
review, a variety of animal models of diabetes with spontaneous onset in 
particular will be introduced and discussed for their implication in diabetes 
research.

Health inequalities in psychiatry are well established, with people living in 
poverty and those from minoritised groups receiving different care and 
experiencing worse health outcomes. Psychiatric patients experience significant 
differences in life expectancy compared with the general population. This 
article explores changes within psychiatric services and public health 
interventions that could address health inequalities and asks why this has not 
happened yet.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to present the experience of 2 
centers undertaking total percutaneous aortic arch-branched graft endovascular 
repair using combination of femoral and axillary routes. The report summarizes 
the procedural steps, outcomes achieved, and the benefits of this approach, 
which eliminates the need for direct open surgical exposure of the carotid, 
subclavian, or axillary arteries, thereby reducing the unnecessary associated 
surgical risks.
METHODS: Retrospectively collected data of 18 consecutive patients (15M:3F) 
undergoing aortic arch endovascular repair using a branched device between 
February 2021 and June 2022 at 2 aortic units. Six patients were treated for a 
residual aortic arch aneurysm following previous type A dissection with size 
range of (58-67 mm in diameter), 10 were treated for saccular or fusiform 
degenerative atheromatous aneurysm with size range of (51.5-80 mm in diameter), 
and 2 were treated for penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) with size range of (50-55 
mm). Technical success was defined as completion of the procedure and 
satisfactory placement of the bridging stent grafts (BSGs) in the supra-aortic 
vessels percutaneously including the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT), left common 
carotid artery (LCCA), and left subclavian artery (LSA) without the need for 
carotid, subclavian, or axillary cut down. The primary technical success was 
examined as primary outcome well as any other related complications and 
reinterventions as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The primary technical success with our alternative approach was 
achieved in all 18 cases. There was one access site complication (groin 
haematoma), which was managed conservatively. There was no incidence of death, 
stroke, or cases of paraplegia. No other immediate complications were noted. 
Postoperative imaging confirmed supra-aortic branch patency, with satisfactory 
position of the BSGs and immediate aneurysm exclusion except in 4 patients who 
had type 1C endoleak (Innominate: 2, LSA 2) detected on the first postoperative 
scan. Three of them were treated with relining/extension, and 1 spontaneously 
resolved after 6 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Total percutaneous aortic arch repair with antegrade and retrograde 
inner-branch endografts can be performed with promising early results. Dedicated 
steerable sheaths and appropriate BSG would optimize the percutaneous approach 
for aortic arch endovascular repairs.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This article provides an alternative and innovative approach to 
improve the minimally invasive techniques in the endovascular treatment of the 
aortic arch conditions.

INTRODUCTION: The increase in the proportion of people with various urinary 
disorders, which are based on anatomical and functional bladder remodeling due 
to aging, is currently un-deniable. This problem becomes more relevant due to 
the elevation in life expectancy. At the same time, the features of bladder 
remodeling, in particular, the structural changes of its vascular bed, are still 
practically not described in the literature. In men, the lower urinary tract 
undergoes additional transformation associated with age due to bladder outlet 
obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Despite the long 
history of studying BPH, the morphological basics of its evolution have not yet 
been fully elucidated, including the development of lower urinary tract 
decompensation and, in particular, the role of vascular changes. In addition, 
structural re-modeling of the bladder muscles in BPH is formed in those with 
pre-existing age-related changes in both the detrusor and its vascular system, 
which cannot but influence the dynamics of disease progression.
AIM: To study the structural changes of detrusor and its vascular bed associated 
with age, and to establish the role of their patterns in patients with BPH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material was a specimen of the bladder wall obtained 
dur-ing: a) autopsies of 35 men aged 60-80 years who died from diseases not 
related to urological or cardiovascular pathology; b) autopsies of 35 men aged 
60-80 years who had BPH without blad-der decompensation; c) intraoperative 
biopsies of 25 men of the same age who undergone surgi-cal treatment for chronic 
urinary retention (postvoid residual volume of more than 300 ml), bilat-eral 
hydronephrosis, as complications of BPH. As a control, we used the specimens 
obtained from 20 males aged 20-30 years who died as a result of violence. 
Histological sections of the bladder wall were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, 
according to Mason and Hart. Standard microscopy and stereometry of detrusor 
structural components and morphometry of the urinary bladder vessels were 
performed using a special ocular insert with 100 equidistant points. During 
morphometric examination of the vascular bed the thickness of the middle layer 
of arteries wall (tunica media) was measured, as well as a thickness of the 
entire wall of the veins in microns. In addition, a Schiff test and 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of these histological sections were performed. The 
IHC was evaluated using a semi-quantitative method, taking into account the 
degree of staining in 10 fields of vision (200). The digital material was 
processed with the STATISTICA program using the Student's t-test. The 
distribution of the obtained data corresponded to normal. The data were 
considered re-liable if the probability of making error did not exceed 5% 
(p<0.05).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In the course of natural aging, a structural remodeling 
of bladder vascular bed was observed, from the development of atherosclerosis of 
extra-organ arteries to restructuring of intra-organ arteries due to arterial 
hypertension. The progression of angiopathy leads to the development of chronic 
detrusor ischemia, which initiates the formation of focal at-rophy of the smooth 
muscles, destructive changes in the elastic fibers, neurodegeneration and stroma 
sclerosis. A long-term BPH leads to compensatory detrusor remodeling with 
hypertrophy of previously unchanged areas. At the same time, age-related 
atrophic and sclerotic changes in smooth muscles are accompanied with 
hypertrophy of individual areas of the bladder detrusor. To maintain adequate 
blood supply to hypertrophied detrusor areas in the arterial and venous bladder 
vessels, a complex of myogenic structures is formed that can regulate blood 
circulation, making it dependent on the energy consumption of specific areas. 
However, progressive age-related changes in the arteries and veins eventually 
lead to an increase in chronic hypoxia, im-paired nervous regulation and 
vascular dystonia, increased blood vessels sclerosis and hyalinosis, and 
sclerosis of intravascular myogenic structures with loss of their function of 
blood flow regu-lation, as well as the development of vein thrombosis. As a 
result, increasing vascular decom-pensation in patients with bladder outlet 
obstruction results in bladder ischemia and accelerates the decompensation of 
the lower urinary tract.

Most wild mammals can serve as hosts both for tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) and 
for the ticks themselves. Among these, wild boars, due to their large body size, 
habitat and life span, show high exposure to ticks and TBPs. These species are 
now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most 
widespread suid. Despite the fact that certain local populations have been 
decimated by African swine fever (ASF), wild boars are still considered 
overabundant in most parts of the world, including Europe. Altogether, their 
long-life expectancy, large home ranges including migration, feeding and social 
behaviors, wide distribution, overabundance and increased chances of 
interactions with livestock or humans make them suitable sentinel species for 
general health threats, such as antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, 
pollution and ASF geographical distribution, as well as for the distribution and 
abundance of hard ticks and also for certain TBPs, such as Anaplasma 
phagocytophilum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of 
rickettsial agents in wild boars from two counties in Romania. Among 203 blood 
samples of wild boars (Sus scrofa ssp. attila) collected during 3 (2019-2022) 
hunting seasons (September-February), 15 were found positive for tick-borne 
pathogen DNA. Six wild boars were positive for A. phagocytophilum DNA presence 
and nine for Rickettsia spp. The identified rickettsial species were R. 
monacensis (six) and R. helvetica (three). No animal was positive either for 
Borrelia spp., Ehrlichia spp. or Babesia spp. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first report of R. monacensis in European wild boars, thus adding the 
third species from the SFG Rickettsia, in the epidemiology of which this wild 
species may have a role as a reservoir host.

Proximal femoral fractures in frail patients have a poor prognosis. Despite the 
high mortality, little is known about the quality of dying (QoD) while this is 
an integral part of palliative care and could influence decision making on 
nonoperative- (NOM) or operative management (OM). To identify the QoD in frail 
patients with a proximal femoral fracture. Data from the prospective FRAIL-HIP 
study, that studied the outcomes of NOM and OM in institutionalized older 
patients ≥70 years with a limited life expectancy who sustained a proximal 
femoral fracture, was analyzed. This study included patients who died within the 
6-month study period and whose proxies evaluated the QoD. The QoD was evaluated 
with the Quality of Dying and Death (QODD) questionnaire resulting in an overall 
score and 4 subcategory scores (Symptom control, Preparation, Connectedness, and 
Transcendence). In total 52 (64% of NOM) and 21 (53% of OM) of the proxies 
responded to the QODD. The overall QODD score was 6.8 (P25-P75 5.7-7.7) 
(intermediate), with 34 (47%) of the proxies rating the QODD 'good to almost 
perfect'. Significant differences in the QODD scores between groups were not 
noted (NOM; 7.0 (P25-P75 5.7-7.8) vs OM; 6.6 (P25-P75 6.1-7.2), P = .73). 
Symptom control was the lowest rated subcategory in both groups. The QoD in 
frail older nursing home patients with a proximal femoral fracture is good and 
humane. QODD scores after NOM are at least as good as OM. Improving symptom 
control would further increase the QoD.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in 
patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and an inadequate response (IR) to 
biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) who completed up to 
152 weeks of treatment in the SELECT-PsA 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT03104374).
METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive blinded upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg 
once daily (QD), or placebo for 24 weeks followed by upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg 
QD. After 56 weeks, patients were eligible to enter an open-label extension 
(OLE) in which they continued their assigned dose of upadacitinib. Efficacy and 
safety were assessed through 152 weeks. A subanalysis of patients with IR to 
tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) was also conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 450 patients entered the OLE and 358 completed 152 weeks of 
treatment. Improvements in efficacy outcomes observed at week 56, including the 
proportion of patients achieving: 20/50/70% improvement in American College of 
Rheumatology criteria, minimal disease activity, and 75/90/100% improvement in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, were maintained through week 152. Efficacy 
outcomes in the TNFi-IR subgroup were similar to those reported in the overall 
population. Upadacitinib was well tolerated throughout long-term treatment, with 
no cumulative adverse effects observed through 152 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of upadacitinib was maintained up to 152 weeks of 
treatment in this highly treatment-refractory population of patients with PsA. 
The long-term safety profile of upadacitinib 15 mg was consistent with its known 
safety profile across indications; no new safety signals were identified.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Paxlovid in reducing severe 
COVID-19 and its associated morality, and to investigate the affordable price of 
Paxlovid in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, two interventions by Paxlovid 
prescription (with and without prescription) were compared in terms of 
COVID-19-related clinical outcomes and economic loss. COVID-related costs were 
collected from the societal perspective. Effectiveness data were obtained from 
literature. The primary outcomes were total social cost, disability adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) and net monetary benefit (NMB). Scenario analyses were 
performed to investigate the affordable price of Paxlovid in China. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
(PSA) were performed to verify the model robustness.
RESULTS: Compared with the non-Paxlovid cohort, the NMBs of the Paxlovid cohort 
were only higher in the subgroup of patients aged over 80 years old, regardless 
of their vaccination status. Our scenario analysis found that, the price ceiling 
of Paxlovid/box for it to be cost-effective was RMB 8,993 (8,970-9,009) in those 
aged over 80 years old who were not vaccinated, which is the highest; and was 
RMB 35 (27-45) in those aged 40-59 years old who were vaccinated, which is the 
lowest. Sensitivity analyses found that the incremental NMB for the vaccinated 
people aged over 80 years was most sensitive to the efficacy of Paxlovid and the 
cost-effectiveness probability of Paxlovid increased with its decreasing price.
CONCLUSION: Under the current marketing price of Paxlovid/box (RMB 1,890), using 
Paxlovid was only cost-effective in people aged over 80 years old regardless of 
their vaccination status.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) represent the most 
prevalent neurodegenerative disorders severely impacting life expectancy and 
quality of life of millions of people worldwide. AD and PD exhibit both a very 
distinct pathophysiological disease pattern. Intriguingly, recent researches, 
however, implicate that overlapping mechanisms may underlie AD and PD. In AD and 
PD, novel cell death mechanisms, encompassing parthanatos, netosis, 
lysosome-dependent cell death, senescence and ferroptosis, apparently rely on 
the production of reactive oxygen species, and seem to be modulated by the 
well-known, "old" second messenger cAMP. Signaling of cAMP via PKA and Epac 
promotes parthanatos and induces lysosomal cell death, while signaling of cAMP 
via PKA inhibits netosis and cellular senescence. Additionally, PKA protects 
against ferroptosis, whereas Epac1 promotes ferroptosis. Here we review the most 
recent insights into the overlapping mechanisms between AD and PD, with a 
special focus on cAMP signaling and the pharmacology of cAMP signaling pathways.

Re-determination of the primary shelf-life of food products: what are the 
guarantees for the consumer?

Except in rare cases, the determination of the shelf-life of food products is 
left up to the food business operator. The extension of this period, which for 
years has been the subject of debate among the various actors in the food chain, 
has become a topic of fundamental importance also following the recent 
economic/financial, environmental, and health crises, which have had an 
inevitable impact on consumption and food waste. While there is no requirement 
to indicate durability for some categories of food products, for example, those 
not directly intended for consumers, this debate has raised questions and 
perplexities about the potential re-evaluation of the origin conditions 
established by the manufacturer, particularly when it comes to maintaining the 
guarantees for the consumer in terms of health and hygiene. In addition, the 
increasing consumer demand for accurate information has prompted the European 
authorities to request a public consultation on the actual understanding and 
perception of the mandatory terms on labels such as use by or date of minimum 
durability of a food, provided for by Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No. 
1169/2011, often not correctly understood, which can assume great significance 
in the application of rules to reduce food waste. In this regard, it is useful 
to remember that the recent measures adopted by the European Union legislator, 
together with the case law of recent years, have led the judges of merit to 
comply with the principles and requirements of food safety laid down since 2002 
in Regulation (EC) No. 178, thus paying greater attention to the analysis, 
assessment, and management of the risk of the entire production chain. The 
purpose of this work is to provide technical-legal elements to encourage a 
possible extension of the shelf-life of food products while ensuring the safety 
of consumers.

Indirect reciprocity is widely recognized as a mechanism for explaining 
cooperation and can be divided into two sub-concepts: downstream and upstream 
reciprocity. Downstream reciprocity is supported by reputation; if someone sees 
you helping someone else, the person who sees this will think higher of you, and 
you will be more likely to be helped. Upstream reciprocity is helping someone 
because you are being helped by somebody else, which often happens in everyday 
life and experimental games. This paper focuses on the behavior of "take" and 
examines negative upstream reciprocity using an upstream reciprocity framework. 
The term "take" is defined as "to steal rather than give resources to others." 
"If something is taken from you, do you take from others?" is an important 
extension for indirect reciprocity research; subsequently, this paper discusses 
experiments conducted on whether negative upstream reciprocity is chained and 
what causes it. The results demonstrated differences between positive and 
negative upstream reciprocity. In analyzing the data of nearly 600 participants 
to determine the extent to which negative upstream reciprocity is observed and 
the causes of negative upstream reciprocity, the study found that If individual 
A takes resources from individual B, then B is more likely to take resources 
from a third-party, individual C. Notably, some causes of positive upstream 
reciprocity were found to have no effect or the opposite effect on negative 
upstream reciprocity. The results also demonstrate that the first person to take 
can cause a chain reaction. This paper demonstrates the importance of the first 
person not taking from someone else and suggests the need to consider various 
behavioral options for future research on cooperation.

Lifetime years married held steady for men with a BA degree since 1960 but 
dropped to lowest level since 1880 for men without a BA.

Trends in life expectancy and marriage patterns work together to determine 
expected lifetime years married. In 1880, adult life expectancy was short and 
marriages were more likely to end by death than divorce. Since then, although 
there have been substantial life expectancy gains in adulthood, marriage has 
been increasingly delayed or forgone and cohabitation and divorce are far more 
prevalent. Whether adults today can expect to spend more or fewer years married 
than in the past depends on the relative magnitude of changes in mortality and 
marriage. We estimate trends in men's expected lifetime years married (and in 
other marital statuses) from 1880 to 2019 and by bachelor's degree (BA) status 
from 1960 to 2019. Our results show a rise in men's expected lifetime years 
married between 1880 and the Baby Boom era and a subsequent fall. There are 
large and growing differences by BA status. Men with a BA have had high and 
relatively stable expected lifetime years married since 1960. For men without a 
BA, expected lifetime years married has plummeted to lows not seen among men 
since 1880. Cohabitation accounts for a substantial fraction, although not all, 
of these declines. Our results demonstrate how increasing inequality in both 
life expectancy and marriage patterns combine to amplify educational differences 
in lifetime experiences of coresidential partnerships.

B a c k g r o u n d: Due to current increased life expectancy, the quality of 
life (QoL) of senior patients is gaining in importance. The aims of this study 
were: to estimate QoL in a group of patients, aged above 64 years, that is cared 
for by general practitioners (GPs) in Krakow, Poland, and to find relation- 
ships between elements of QoL and the results of comprehensive geriatric 
assessment (CGA) and other important medical and social factors. M e t h o d s: 
We designed a cross-sectional, questionnaire study among patients who attended 
GPs' surgeries from April 2018 to April 2019. To examine the patients, we used 
the Euro-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and eight scales forming CGA: 
the Activities of Daily Living, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, 
Mini Nutritional Assessment, Clinical Frailty Scale and Athens Insomnia Scale. R 
e s u l t s: The lowest QoL was observed in dimensions of pain/discomfort and 
mobility, where 70% and 52% of patients, respectively, reported problems in 
these areas. Only 91 (21%) respondents had highest results in all five 
dimensions of QoL. The average score in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of the 
EQ-5D-5L (representing self-rated health on a given day) was 62.36 ± 18.98 
points. Statistically significant relationships were observed between QoL and 
age, physical activity and multimorbidity (in all cases p <0.001). The results 
of QoL were correlated with every aspect of CGA, while the strongest 
relationship was noticed between scores in the EQ-5D-5L VAS scale and scales 
assessing depression and frailty (p <0.001; r = -0.57 both).

OBJECTIVE: Incidentally detected gallbladder polyps are commonly encountered 
when performing upper abdominal ultrasound. Our purpose was to estimate the life 
expectancy (LE) benefit of ultrasound-based gallbladder surveillance in patients 
with small (6-7 to <10 mm), incidentally detected gallbladder polyps, accounting 
for patient sex, age, and comorbidity level.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate hypothetical 
cohorts of women and men with small gallbladder polyps, with varying age (66-80 
years) and comorbidity level (none, mild, moderate, severe). Drawing from 
current evidence, in the base case, we assumed no increased risk of gallbladder 
cancer in patients with small gallbladder polyps. To estimate maximal possible 
LE gains from surveillance, we assumed perfect cancer control consequent to 5 
years of surveillance. We varied key assumptions including cancer risk and test 
performance characteristics in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Projected LE gains from surveillance were <3 days across most cohorts 
and scenarios evaluated. For 66- and 80-year-olds with no comorbidities, LE 
gains were 1.46 and 1.45 days, respectively, for women, and 0.67 and 0.75 days 
for men. With 10 years of surveillance, LE gains increased to 2.94 days for 
66-year-old women with no comorbidities (men: 1.35 days). If we assumed a 10% 
increase in gallbladder cancer risk among individuals with polyps, LE gains 
increased slightly to 1.60 days for 66-year-old women with no comorbidities 
(men: 0.74 days). Results were sensitive to test performance and surgical 
mortality.
DISCUSSION: Even under unrealistic, optimistic assumptions of cancer control, 
ultrasound surveillance of incidentally detected small gallbladder polyps 
provided limited benefit.

Long-lived mouse models and treatments that extend lifespan, such as Rapamycin, 
acarbose and 17α- -estradiol, lead to reduction in mTORC1 activity, declines in 
cap-dependent translation and increases in cap-independent translation. In 
addition, these treatments reduce the MEK-ERK-MNK (ERK1-2) signaling cascade, 
leading to reduction in eIF4E phosphorylation, which also regulates mRNA 
translation. Here, we report that Canagliflozin, a drug that extends lifespan 
only in male mice reduces mTORC1 and ERK1-2 signaling in male mice only. The 
data suggest reduction in mTORC1 and ERK pathways are common mechanisms shared 
by both genetic and pharmacological models of slowed aging in mice. Our data 
also reveal a significant sexual dimorphism in the ERK1-2 signaling pathway 
which might help to explain why some drugs can extend lifespan in males but have 
no effects in female mice.

The advent of newer and better tolerated antiretroviral therapy has 
progressively shortened the life expectancy gap between people living with HIV 
(PWH) and the general population. However, in this aging cohort, cardiovascular 
disease is now a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite advances 
in cardiac care. Therefore, it is critical to assess and treat all 
cardiovascular disease risk factors, including dyslipidemia, early and 
aggressively in PWH. Data are not as robust regarding the pathogenesis and 
management of dyslipidemia in PWH, with most evidence being extrapolated from 
the general uninfected population. In this review the authors describe the 
current understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV and antiretroviral 
therapy-induced dyslipidemia, and the approach to risk assessment and 
management, given that drug-drug interactions remain an important consideration 
in this population.

Update in
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Jul 09;(7):CD006910.

BACKGROUND: Cancer of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal origin, referred to 
collectively as ovarian cancer, is the eighth most common cancer in women and is 
often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Women with relapsed epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC) are less well and have a limited life expectancy, therefore 
maintaining quality of life with effective symptom control is an important aim 
of treatment. However, the unwanted effects of chemotherapy agents may be 
severe, and optimal treatment regimens are unclear. Pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin (PLD), which contains a cytotoxic drug called doxorubicin 
hydrochloride, is one of several treatment modalities that may be considered for 
treatment of relapsed EOCs. This is an update of the original Cochrane Review 
which was published in Issue 7, 2013.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PLD, with or without other 
anti-cancer drugs, in women with relapsed high grade epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (via Ovid) and Embase (via Ovid) 
from 1990 to January 2022. We also searched online registers of clinical trials, 
abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that 
evaluated PLD in women diagnosed with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data to 
a pre-designed data collection form and assessed the risk of bias according to 
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. Where 
possible, we pooled collected data in meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: This is an update of a previous review with 12 additional studies, 
so this updated review includes a total of 26 RCTs with 8277 participants that 
evaluated the effects of PLD alone or in combination with other drugs in 
recurrent EOC: seven in platinum-sensitive disease (2872 participants); 11 in 
platinum-resistant disease (3246 participants); and eight that recruited 
individuals regardless of platinum sensitivity status (2079 participants). The 
certainty of the evidence was assessed for the three most clinically relevant 
comparisons out of eight comparisons identified in the included RCTs. Recurrent 
platinum-sensitive EOC PLD with conventional chemotherapy agent compared to 
alternative combination chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference 
in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.83 to 1.04; 5 studies, 2006 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but 
likely increases progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89; 
5 studies, 2006 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The combination may 
slightly improve quality of life at three months post-randomisation, measured 
using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire C30 (mean difference 4.80, 95% CI 0.92 to 8.68; 1 study, 608 
participants; low-certainty evidence), but this may not represent a clinically 
meaningful difference. PLD in combination with another chemotherapy agent 
compared to alternative combination chemotherapy likely results in little to no 
difference in the rate of overall severe adverse events (grade ≥ 3) (risk ratio 
(RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30; 2 studies, 834 participants; moderate-certainty 
evidence). PLD with chemotherapy likely increases anaemia (grade ≥ 3) (RR 1.37, 
95% CI 1.02 to 1.85; 5 studies, 1961 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). 
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of PLD with conventional 
chemotherapy on hand-foot syndrome (HFS)(grade ≥ 3) (RR 4.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 
16.01; 2 studies, 1028 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 
neurological events (grade ≥ 3) (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74; 4 studies, 1900
