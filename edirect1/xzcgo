administration, leading to efficient mobilization of stem cells from bone marrow 
into blood circulation and reduction of systemic inflammation. Consequently, 
nanodisc based SP peptide delivery promoted blood vessel formation, blood 
perfusion recovery and markedly improved limb salvage in diabetic hindlimb 
ischemia model relative to administration of free SP without nanodisc 
modification. Therefore, HDL-SP nanodisc can provide a novel strategy for the 
treatment of diabetic ischemia and HDL nanodisc modification could be 
potentially useful for the extension of plasma circulation of other labile 
peptides.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines on the management of displaced intracapsular fractures 
recommend using an Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel-rated cemented implant. 
Prior to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, 
uncemented implants were commonly used in the UK.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined the outcomes of patients with uncemented 
Thompson's hemiarthroplasties at our unit, between April 2005 and December 2010. 
Patients who underwent revision surgery before December 2011 were identified. 
Implant survival calculation utilised the primary outcome of revision to total 
hip arthroplasty, revision hemiarthroplasty or excision arthroplasty. Patients 
who died post-operatively were identified and censored.
RESULTS: A total of 1445 patients received uncemented Thompson's implant. 
Patient mean age was 82 years with 76% female. Forty-six (3.2%) patients 
required revision with 15% performed within 30 days of surgery and 62% within 
1 year. Reasons for revision were infection (0.83%), acetabular erosion (0.83%) 
and loosening (0.62%). Twenty-seven patients (59% of total revisions) underwent 
revision to THA, 14 (30%) to excision arthroplasty and 5 (11%) to revision 
hemiarthroplasty. Cumulative survival rate was 98% at 1 year and 95% at 5 years. 
Thirty-day mortality was 7.1%. One-year mortality was 28.1%.
CONCLUSION: Current guidelines strongly favour cemented hemiarthroplasty. 
Recognition that fractured hip patients are a non-homogeneous group is 
important. In patients with limited life expectancy, an uncemented Thompson is a 
quick, simple, palliative solution to early mobilisation. Correct surgical 
technique avoids using cement in this cohort, which is most vulnerable to bone 
cement implantation syndrome. Cost-effective resource utilisation with an 
increasingly elderly population remains a surgical responsibility.

Ageing and healthcare expenditures: Exploring the role of individual health 
status.

In 1999, Zweifel, Felder, and Meiers questioned conventional wisdom on ageing 
and healthcare expenditure (HCE). According to these authors, the positive 
association between age and HCE is due to an increasing age-specific mortality 
and the high cost of dying. After a weighty academic debate, a new consensus was 
reached on the importance of proximity to death when analysing HCE. 
Nevertheless, the influence of individual health status remains unknown. The 
objective of our study is to analyse the influence individual health status has 
on HCE, when compared to proximity to death and demographic effects and 
considering a comprehensive view of healthcare services and costs. We examined 
data concerning different HCE components of N = 61,473 persons aged 30 to 
95 years old. Using 2-part models, we analysed the probability of use and 
positive HCE. Regardless of the specific group of healthcare services, HCE at 
the end of life depends mainly on the individual health status. Proximity to 
death approximates individual morbidity when it is excluded from the model. The 
inclusion of morbidity generally improves the goodness of fit. These results 
provide implications for the analysis of ageing population and its impact on HCE 
that should be taken into account.

Changes in quality of life and functional capacity after lung transplantation: A 
single-center experience.

Lung transplantation (LT) increases the life expectancy of patients affected by 
end stage pulmonary disease; specifically, its ultimate aims are to improve 
survival and health related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of the present 
longitudinal study was to determine the HRQoL trajectory and changes in 
functional capacity from time of entry in the waiting list for LT to 2 year 
after LT. The study included sixty-nine outpatients enrolled in a single medical 
center when they entered the waiting list for LT and who subsequently received 
it. They were then followed up over 2 years after LT. HRQoL was assessed by the 
physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores of the 36-item Short 
Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). 
Psychological distress was evaluated with the General Health Questionnaire 
(GHQ), and functional capacity was investigated using the six-minute walk test 
(6MWT) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Patients showed low SF-36 PCS 
(30.5±7.8) and SGRQ total (61.8±17.5) scores at entry in the waiting list, but 
exhibited significant changes over time after LT (p<0.001). Furthermore, 
patients who showed an increase of at least 50% in SF36 PCS and SGRQ scores at 6 
months survived longer. Both FEV1 and 6MWT distance as well as GHQ scores 
significantly changed over time, with improvements occurring in the first 6 
months after LT but no major changes thereafter. Out of the 69 patients 
enrolled, 32 died over a median follow-up of 51 months. Although mortality 
tended to be slightly higher for patients with lower HRQoL at the baseline 
assessment, this difference was not statistically significant. HRQoL evaluations 
appear critical in the follow-up of LT candidates, in particularly SGRQ, because 
of its specificity in targeting respiratory symptoms and functional wellbeing.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in 
Mexico, is a heterogeneous disease, and knowledge of prognostic factors are 
critical in making treatment decisions.
OBJETIVE: determine the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 
5 years, analyzed by risk groups.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with breast treated at the Institute of 
Breast Diseases FUCAM from July 2005 to December 2014 were included. Simple 
frequencies were used for analysis of the general characteristics, and 5- year 
OS and DFS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. A subset analysis of the 
clinical stage and comparing survival in those patients diagnosed by mammography 
screening program was performed.
RESULTS: 4,902 patients with breast cancer were included, general clinical and 
pathological features are described and 3,762 patients were included for 
analysis of 5-year OS and DFS. The average age at diagnosis was 53.7 years; 
13.3% were <40 years, which deleteriously reflects on the supervivencia global 
76 vs 84% in >40. At diagnosis predominated locally advanced stages (45%), OS 
and DFS at 5 years was 96.8 ± 0.6% and 93.4%±0.9 respectively for early stages, 
74.6 ± 1.7% and 68.7 ± 2% for locally advanced and 35.9 ± 5.1% and 37.4 ± 10.3% 
for metastatic tumors. Women diagnosed in the screening program had 
significantly better OS and DFS compared with symptomatic patients (95 and 93% 
vs 79 and 77%). For biological subtypes, OS and DFS was 89 and 84% for luminal, 
81 and 81% for luminal Her +, 74 and 78% for pure Her 2, and 69 and 73% for 
triple negative.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the prognostic factors that affect survival of patients 
with breast cancer is essential for categorizing risk groups and to 
individualize treatment in order to improve life expectancy.

Hospital, Fondation Asile des Aveugles , Lausanne , Switzerland.

PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor recurrence in the papillary or macular region 
is a threat to life and visual prognosis respectively, making early detection 
indispensable. This study demonstrates the value of optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) in the early detection of subclinical tumor recurrence.
METHODS: Since June 2012, hand-held SD-OCT (spectral domain Optical Coherence 
Tomography) of retro-equatorial foci, the optic head nerve and macula, is 
systematically performed under anesthesia in children treated and followed for 
Rb.
RESULTS: Between June 2012 and January 2017, 16 subclinical recurrent tumors in 
14 children were detected only by OCT in flat pigmented scars (n = 9), in type 2 
regression (n = 3), on the optic nerve head (n = 3), and as secondary retinal 
seeding (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: OCT has become invaluable in the modern management of Rb. It allows 
not only early detection of a lesion before any tumor extension towards the 
macula or optic nerve head, but also the monitoring of the therapeutic response.

UK.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether collagen-containing dressings could potentially 
afford the UK's National Health Service (NHS) a cost-effective intervention for 
the management of non-healing venous leg ulcers (VLUs).
METHOD: This was a modelling study performed from the perspective of the UK's 
NHS. A combination of published clinical outcomes, resource utilisation 
estimates and utilities for VLUs enabled the construction of a decision model, 
depicting the management of a chronic VLU with standard care or with a 
collagen-containing dressing plus compression therapy followed by standard care, 
over a period of 6 months. The model estimated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of the two interventions in terms of the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 2015/16 prices.
RESULTS: The treatment of VLUs of >6 months' duration with a collagen-containing 
dressing plus compression therapy followed by standard care, instead of standard 
care, is expected to increase the probability of healing from 0.11 to 0.49 by 6 
months and increase health-related quality of life at 6 months from 0.331 to 
0.373 QALYs per patient. Additionally, treatment with a collagen-containing 
dressing plus compression therapy followed by standard care has the potential to 
reduce management costs by 40% over 6 months when compared with standard care 
(from £6328 to £3789 per patient).
CONCLUSION: Within the study's limitations, including a collagen-containing 
dressing into a standard care protocol compared with standard care potentially 
affords the NHS a cost-effective (dominant) treatment since it improves outcomes 
for less cost.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) compared to a no vaccination strategy in 
Chinese infants.
METHODS: A Markov process model was developed to examine the outcomes of PCV-13 
against a no vaccination strategy using data and assumptions adapted for 
relevance to China. Outcomes over a lifetime horizon are presented. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, a PCV-13 vaccination program would provide 
a gain of 0.009 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per subject. From 
the health care and societal perspectives, the incremental costs per QALY were 
$20,709 and 18,483, respectively. When herd effect was included, the cost 
effectiveness of the PCV-13 vaccination strategy was notably improved. The lower 
price of PCV-13 will improve the cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The PCV-13 vaccination is likely to be cost-effective at the 
current Chinese prices and ceiling threshold ($8,382).

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes morbidity and mortality among all 
ages in The Netherlands. To reduce this burden, infants in The Netherlands 
receive the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV10), but older persons 
are not targeted. We assessed the impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination 
with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or 13-valent PCV 
(PCV13) among all those aged 60, 65 or 70 and/or in combination with replacing 
PCV10 with PCV13 in the infant vaccination programme.
METHODS: A static cost-effectiveness model was parameterized including projected 
trends for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and hospitalised community 
acquired pneumonia (CAP). The different strategies were evaluated using vaccine 
list prices and a 10-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) were calculated with the current strategy (infant vaccination program 
with PCV10) as reference.
RESULTS: Compared to the reference, the largest impact on pneumococcal disease 
burden was projected with a combined use of PCV13 among infants and PPV23 at 60, 
65 and 70 years, preventing 1,635 cases of IPD and 914 cases of CAP. The most 
cost-effective strategy was vaccinating with PPV23 at 70 years only with similar 
low ICERs at age 60 and 65. The impact of the use of PCV13 among infants depends 
strongly on the projected herd-immunity effect on serotype 19A. Vaccinating 
elderly with either PCV13 or PPV23 was dominated by PPV23 in all investigated 
scenarios, mainly due to the lower price of PPV23.
CONCLUSION: Under the current assumptions, the best value for money is the use 
of PPV23 for elderly, with a single dose or at five year increment between age 
60 to age 70.

INTRODUCTION: Kidneys from donors affected by autosomal-dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD) are, in general, considered unsuitable for 
transplantation. However, some authors report cases of patients who received 
kidneys from a deceased ADPKD donor showing encouraging outcomes. Our aim is to 
provide our experience of a patient with end stage renal failure who received a 
deceased donor kidney from a 29-year-old who themselves had been diagnosed with 
ADPKD but well maintained renal function, and to provide a comprehensive review 
of all the published literature.
METHODS: In addition to our case, a literature search (PubMed database, Embase, 
Cochrane Library) of articles published between 1980 and 2017 was performed.
RESULTS: Sixteen cases were identified. Median donor age was 24 (range12-55) 
years old. Median recipient age was 46 (range 19-72) years old. Fifteen cases 
had a single kidney transplant and one case had a dual kidney transplant. 13/16 
(81%) had immediate function, 2 patients (12.5%) had delayed graft function and 
one patient (6.25%) had primary non-function. Median graft follow up was 36 
months (range 6-180). Median serum creatinine at last follow up was 124 μmol/L 
(range75-442). Thirteen patients (81%) were still alive with a working renal 
transplant at last follow up.
CONCLUSION: The published literature is encouraging and supports the use of 
polycystic kidneys from younger deceased donors. Therefore, we believe that if 
kidneys from ADPKD donors are offered, they should have a full assessment and be 
considered acceptable for renal donation to recipients who may have a life 
expectancy of 10 years or less and who are fully informed and have the capacity 
to consent to receiving a polycystic kidney.

Over the last years, increasing attention has been paid to environmental 
concerns related to food production and potential solutions to this issue. Among 
the different strategies being considered to reduce the impact food production 
has on the environment, only moderate has been paid to the extension of shelf 
life; a longer shelf life can reduce food losses as well as the economic and 
environmental impacts of the distribution logistics. The aim of this study is to 
assess the environmental performance of whole-wheat breadsticks with extended 
shelf lives and to evaluate whether the shelf-life extension is an effective 
mitigation solution from an environmental point of view. To this purpose, the 
life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was applied from a "cradle-to-grave" 
perspective. Rosmarinic acid was used as an antioxidant to extend the shelf 
life. To test the robustness of the results and to investigate the influence of 
the choices made in the modelling phase, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis 
were carried out. The achieved results highlighted how, for 10 of the 12 
evaluated impact categories, the shelf-life extension is a proper mitigation 
solution, and its effectiveness depends on the magnitude of product loss 
reduction that is achieved. The shelf-life extension doesn't allow for the 
reduction of environmental impact in the categories of human toxicity, cancer 
effects and freshwater eutrophication.

BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) constitute 60% of the approximately 5 
million people in the U.S. infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment of 
PWID is complex due to addiction, mental illness, poverty, homelessness, lack of 
positive social support, poor adherence-related skills, low motivation and 
knowledge, and poor access to and trust in the health care system. New 
direct-acting antiviral medications are available for HCV with high cure rates 
and few side effects. The life expectancy and economic benefits of new HCV 
treatments will not be realized unless we determine optimal models of care for 
the majority of HCV-infected patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
the effectiveness of directly observed therapy and group treatment compared with 
self-administered individual treatment in a large, urban opioid agonist therapy 
clinic setting in the Bronx, New York.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial 150 PWID with chronic HCV 
were recruited from opioid agonist treatment (OAT) clinics and randomized to one 
of three models of onsite HCV treatment in OAT: 1) modified directly observed 
therapy; 2) group treatment; or 3) control - self-administered individual 
treatment. Participants were age 18 or older, HCV genotype 1, English or Spanish 
speaking, treatment naïve (or treatment experienced after 12/3/14), willing to 
receive HCV treatment onsite, receiving methadone or buprenorphine at the 
medication window at least once per week, and able to provide informed consent. 
Outcomes of interest include adherence (as measured by self-report and 
electronic blister packs), HCV treatment completion, sustained virologic 
response, drug resistance, and cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: This paper describes the design and rationale of a randomized 
controlled trial comparing three models of care for HCV therapy delivered in an 
opioid agonist treatment program. Our trial will be critical to rigorously 
identify models of care that result in high adherence and cure rates. Use of 
blister pack technology will help us determine the role of adherence in 
successful cure of HCV. Moreover, the trial methodology outlined here can serve 
as a template for the development of future programs and studies among 
HCV-infected drug users receiving opioid agonist therapy, as well as the 
cost-effectiveness of such programs.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( 
NCT01857245 ). Trial registration was obtained prospectively on May 20th, 2013.

Leishmania infantum is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by 
phlebotomine sand flies and dogs are considered the main reservoir of the 
parasite. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infantum is an emergent feline 
disease more and more frequently reported in endemic areas. This review 
summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities and differences with canine 
leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by the same Leishmania species than dogs 
but prevalence of the infection is lower and cases of disease are less 
frequently reported. Scarce information is available on adaptive immune response 
of cats naturally exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible 
for susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of 
clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired 
immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected in sick 
cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical FeL albeit 
lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have been detected in skin, 
lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral mucosa, stomach, large bowel, 
kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are 
the most common reason for veterinary consultation and finding on physical 
examination in cats with leishmaniosis. Molecular investigations of Leishmania 
DNA and anti- Leishmania antibody detection are largely used with the same 
methodologies for both CanL and FeL, however few information is available about 
their diagnostic performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical 
FeL is still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs 
prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually good 
unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis does not seem 
significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral coinfection. According to 
current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional reservoir host of L. 
infantum and, in a « One Health » perspective, preventative measures should be 
taken. In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease 
caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have many 
similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is not available 
and we cannot exclude that important differences between dogs and cats exist 
about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best practice for management and 
prevention.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis continues to disproportionately affect many Indigenous 
populations in the USA, Canada, and Greenland. We aimed to investigate whether 
population-based tuberculosis-specific interventions or changes in general 
health and socioeconomic indicators, or a combination of these factors, were 
associated with changes in tuberculosis incidence in these Indigenous 
populations.
METHODS: For this population-based study we examined annual tuberculosis 
notification rates between 1960 and 2014 in six Indigenous populations of the 
USA, Canada, and Greenland (Inuit [Greenland], American Indian and Alaska Native 
[Alaska, USA], First Nations [Alberta, Canada], Cree of Eeyou Istchee [Quebec, 
Canada], Inuit of Nunavik [Quebec, Canada], and Inuit of Nunavut [Canada]), as 
well as the general population of Canada. We used mixed-model linear regression 
to estimate the association of these rates with population-wide interventions of 
bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination of infants, radiographic screening, 
or testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and with 
other health and socioeconomic indicators including life expectancy, infant 
mortality, diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, crowded housing, employment, 
education, and health expenditures.
FINDINGS: Tuberculosis notification rates declined rapidly in all six Indigenous 
populations between 1960 and 1980, with continued decline in Indigenous 
populations in Alberta, Alaska, and Eeyou Istchee thereafter but recrudescence 
in Inuit populations of Nunavut, Nunavik, and Greenland. Annual percentage 
reductions in tuberculosis incidence were significantly associated with two 
tuberculosis control interventions, relative to no intervention, and after 
adjustment for infant mortality and smoking: BCG vaccination (-11%, 95% CI -6 to 
-17) and LTBI screening and treatment (-10%, -3 to -18). Adjusted associations 
were not significant for chest radiographic screening (-1%, 95% CI -7 to 5). 
Declining tuberculosis notification rates were significantly associated with 
increased life expectancy (-37·8 [95% CI -41·7 to -33·9] fewer cases per 100 000 
for each 1-year increase) and decreased infant mortality (-9·0 [-9·5 to -8·6] 
fewer cases per 100 000 for each death averted per 1000 livebirths) in all six 
Indigenous populations, but no significant associations were observed for other 
health and socioeconomic indicators examined.
INTERPRETATION: Population-based BCG vaccination of infants and LTBI screening 
and treatment were associated with significant decreases in tuberculosis 
notification rates in these Indigenous populations. These interventions should 
be reinforced in populations still affected by tuberculosis, while also 
addressing the persistent health and socioeconomic disparities.

The elderly population is increasing and the response of the society was to 
provide them with services directed to them to cope with their needs. One of the 
oldest solutions is the retirement home, providing housing and permanent 
assistance for the elderly. Furthermore, most of the retirement homes are 
inhabited by multiple elderly people, thus creating a community of people who 
are somewhat related in age and medical issues. The ambient assisted living 
(AAL) area tries to solve some of the elderly issues by producing technological 
products, some of them dedicated to elderly homes. One of the identified problem 
is that elderly people are sometimes discontent about the activities that 
consume most of their day promoted by the retirement home social workers. The 
work presented in this paper attempts to improve how these activities are 
scheduled taking into account the elderlies' emotional response to these 
activities. The aim is to maximize the group happiness by promoting the 
activities the group likes, minding if they are bored due to activities 
repetition. In this sense, this paper presents an extension of the Cognitive 
Life Assistant platform incorporating a social emotional model. The proposed 
system has been modelled as a free time activity manager which is in charge of 
suggesting activities to the social workers.

Cost-effectiveness (CE) thresholds are being discussed more frequently and there 
have been many new developments in this area; however, there is a lack of 
understanding about what thresholds mean and their implications. This paper 
provides an overview of the CE threshold literature. First, the meaning of a CE 
threshold and the key assumptions involved (perfect divisibility, marginal 
increments in budget, etc.) are highlighted using a hypothetical example, and 
the use of historic/heuristic estimates of the threshold is noted along with 
their limitations. Recent endeavours to estimate the empirical value of the 
thresholds, both from the supply side and the demand side, are then presented. 
The impact on CE thresholds of future directions for the field, such as 
thresholds across sectors and the incorporation of multiple criteria beyond 
quality-adjusted life-years as a measure of 'value', are highlighted. Finally, a 
number of common issues and misconceptions associated with CE thresholds are 
addressed.

The expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat, translated into a polyglutamine 
expanded sequence in the protein encoded by the MJD gene, was identified over 
20 years ago as the causative mutation in a severe neurodegenerative disorder 
originally diagnosed in individuals of Portuguese ancestry. This incapacitating 
disease, called Machado-Joseph disease or spinocebellar ataxia type 3, is 
integrated into a larger group of neurodegenerative disorders-the polyglutamine 
expansion disorders-caused by extension of a CAG repeat in the coding sequence 
of otherwise unrelated genes. These diseases are generally linked with the 
appearance of intracellular inclusions , which despite having a controversial 
role in disease appearance and development represent a characteristic common 
fingerprint in all polyglutamine-related disorders. Although polyglutamine 
expansion is an obvious trigger for neuronal dysfunction, the role of the 
different domains of these complex proteins in the function and aggregation 
properties of the carrier proteins is being uncovered in recent studies. In this 
review the current knowledge about the structural and functional features of 
full-length ataxin-3 protein will be discussed. The intrinsic conformational 
dynamics and interplay between the globular and intrinsically disordered regions 
of ataxin-3 will be highlighted, and a perspective picture of the role of known 
ataxin-3 post-translational modifications on regulating ataxin-3 aggregation and 
function will be drawn.

The thalassemias are the most common single gene disorder in the world. 
Nowadays, the average life expectancy of patients in developed countries has 
increased significantly, while, there was an increase of complications. We aimed 
to investigate peripheral neuropathy and myopathy in this patient group using a 
neurophysiological study. We performed nerve conduction studies and 
electromyography of upper and lower extremities on 36 beta-thalassemia major 
(β-thal) patients. The electrophysiological findings were correlated with 
demographic data and laboratory parameters of the disease. Patients with β-thal 
present polyneuropathy or myopathy at (50%). Polyneuropathy was detected in 
(38.9%) and myopathy in (27.8%), while polyneuropathy and myopathy were present 
at (16.7%) with an overlap of the diseases in 1/3 of the patients. There was not 
a statistically significant correlation of polyneuropathy and myopathy with age, 
sex, splenectomy, nor with respect to laboratory parameters, hemoglobin, and 
ferritin. However, there was a statistically significant correlation of 
polyneuropathy and myopathy with iron overload, as recorded by the magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart and the liver. Our findings suggest that 
iron overload plays a key role in the pathogenesis of polyneuropathy and 
myopathy in β-thal patients, and performing heart and liver MRI for the 
prediction of such lesions in an annual basis is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Honeydew is a sugar-rich excretion produced by sap-feeding 
Sternorrhyncha and is an important source of carbohydrates for natural enemies, 
especially for parasitoids. Honeydew derived from genetically modified (GM) 
crops can contain amounts of the transgene product. Thus, it is a possible route 
of exposure for natural enemies feeding on honeydew. In the present study, the 
potential effects of Nilaparvata lugens honeydew derived from Cry1C and Cry2A 
rice on different life-table parameters and parasitism dynamics of the egg 
parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae were evaluated under laboratory and field 
conditions. Furthermore, the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) levels and the sugar 
and amino acid composition of honeydew were analyzed.
RESULTS: Results indicated that A. nilaparvatae was exposed to Bt proteins by 
feeding on N. lugens honeydew produced from Bt rice. However, honeydew derived 
from the tested Cry1C and Cry2A rice lines did not affect the development, 
longevity, emergence rate and fecundity of A. nilaparvatae. Also, the parasitism 
dynamics in the field remained unaffected. In addition, the sugar and amino acid 
composition of N. lugens honeydew was not significantly altered for the tested 
Bt rice lines compared with the parental non-Bt plant.
CONCLUSION: The quality of honeydew derived from the tested Bt rice lines as a 
food resource for natural enemies was maintained. © 2018 Society of Chemical

Life expectancy is continuously increasing due to major progress in preventing, 
delaying or curing various pathologies normally encountered in old age. However, 
both scientific and medical advances are still required to understand underlying 
cause of the disparate comorbidities occurrence with aging. In one hand, aging 
profoundly impairs the immune system; it is characterized by many changes in 
haematopoiesis, adaptive and innate systems, associated with pro-inflammatory 
environment. In another hand, stressful events (acute or chronic) can also 
impact the immune system through the secretion of hormones, which are also 
altered with aging. The field of psychoneuroimmunology is now providing 
evidences that in acute medical conditions, elderly people are not equal in 
their responses to stressors depending on many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. 
These parameters could interfere with elderly's ability to mount an effective 
immune response. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the 
literature (from fundamental to clinical observations) to draw a parallel 
between immune dysregulation caused by stress or by aging. Understanding this 
entanglement could enable us to target fundamental age-related pathways and thus 
open new avenues in improving both lifespan and health span.

A questionnaire-based study was undertaken to assess health problems affecting 
the Dogue de Bordeaux breed of dog and, in particular, the potential impact of 
cardiac disease. An online survey tool was used to design a questionnaire for 
Dogue de Bordeaux owners and breeders. After 1year of response time, information 
was collected on 278 dogs owned by 215 individuals, mostly based in the United 
Kingdom. Of the 278 dogs, veterinary attention had been sought for chronic skin 
disease in 63 (22.7%), lameness in 43 (15.5%), gastrointestinal signs in 37 
(13.3%) and neoplasia in 28 (10.1%). Cardiac disease was reported in 13/278 dogs 
(4.7%). At the time of completion of the survey, 55 (19.8%) dogs were dead, 17 
(31%) of which were reported to have died suddenly and unexpectedly. Respondents 
expressed interest in a formal cardiac health screening scheme in the Dogue de 
Bordeaux breed, but would be reluctant to volunteer for such a scheme if 
information on disease detected during screening was open access. The incidence 
of sudden unexpected death was high; although there was no corroboration that 
the sudden deaths were related to cardiac disease, a possible connection should 
be explored further.

According to statistical data, the number of healthy life years is not 
increasing in proportion with the longer average life expectancy. In the ageing 
societies, the long-term care systems are increasingly overburdened; 
cost-efficient operation and the related coordination of services is one of the 
key questions for their sustainability. The present separation of the health 
care and social care systems causes numerous difficulties. One aim of the online 
research by questionnaire was to survey the attitude of general practitioners - 
who play a very important part in care for the elderly - towards their elder 
patients, the patients' family members, and social workers providing eldercare. 
The other aim was to gather information on shortcomings experienced by doctors 
in the care system and on what possibilities general practitioners see for the 
improvement of eldercare. Semi-structured questionnaires were applied and 
analysed by descriptive and content methodology. The questionnaires were sent 
out to 5060 addresses around the country: a total of 145 were returned filled 
in. The respondents made many recommendations for the improvement of eldercare 
in the categories of development of social services, family support, development 
of health services, and societal cooperation. The areas in need of development
