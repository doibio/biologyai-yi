Educational inequalities in all-cause mortality have been observed for decades. 
However, the underlying biological mechanisms are not well known. We aimed to 
assess the role of DNA methylation changes in blood captured by epigenetic 
clocks in explaining these inequalities. Data were from 8 prospective 
population-based cohort studies, representing 13 021 participants. First, 
educational inequalities and their portion explained by Horvath DNAmAge, Hannum 
DNAmAge, DNAmPhenoAge, and DNAmGrimAge epigenetic clocks were assessed in each 
cohort via counterfactual-based mediation models, on both absolute (hazard 
difference) and relative (hazard ratio) scales, and by sex. Second, estimates 
from each cohort were pooled through a random effect meta-analysis model. Men 
with low education had excess mortality from all causes of 57 deaths per 10 000 
person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38, 76) compared with their more 
advantaged counterparts. For women, the excess mortality was 4 deaths per 10 000 
person-years (95% CI: -11, 19). On the relative scale, educational inequalities 
corresponded to hazard ratios of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.57) for men and 1.15 (95% 
CI: 0.96, 1.37) for women. DNAmGrimAge accounted for the largest proportion, 
approximately 50%, of the educational inequalities for men, while the proportion 
was negligible for women. Most of this mediation was explained by differential 
effects of unhealthy lifestyles and morbidities of the World Health Organization 
(WHO) risk factors for premature mortality. These results support DNA 
methylation-based epigenetic aging as a signature of educational inequalities in 
life expectancy emphasizing the need for policies to address the unequal social 
distribution of these WHO risk factors.

Metal wear debris generation in primary total knee arthroplasty: is it an issue?

Kellens J, Berger P, Vandenneucker H.

More durable total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) are needed, due to the rising life 
expectancy, the higher activity levels of patients and the growing concerns 
about aseptic loosening being caused by metal hypersensitivity. In response, 
different hypoallergenic metal coatings have been developed for TKAs. However, 
possible adverse effects of these different metals (cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, 
zirconium, titanium and tantalum) have been neglected. The aim was to summarize 
the local and systemic adverse effects (including metal hypersensitivity), 
survival ratios, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and the plasma metal 
ion concentrations of the different TKA coatings. A literature search on PubMed 
and EMBASE was performed. In total, 15 studies were found eligible. Common 
adverse effects of TKA were infection, loosening, pain, instability and hyper- 
coagulation disorders. Serious adverse effects related to TKA implants were not 
reported. The survival ratios and patient-reported outcome measures seem to 
confirm these good results. In contrast with chromium and cobalt, no significant 
differences were reported in the nickel, molybdenum and titanium concentrations. 
No significant differences between the hypoallergenic and standard TKA implants 
were found in terms of adverse effects, survival ratios and PROMs. A causal 
relationship between the common adverse effects and the different metals is 
unlikely. Due to the heterogeneity of the TKA implants used, no firm conclusions 
could be made. Further research with longer follow-up studies are needed to find 
possible adverse effects and differences. Thus far, the hypoallergenic implants 
seem to perform equal to the standard implants.

Objective: To explore the trend of disease burden of degenerative mitral valve 
disease (DMVD) in the Chinese population from 1990 to 2019. Methods: Based on 
the 2019 Global Burden of Disease database (GBD 2019), the number of patients, 
the number of new cases, the number of deaths, the disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY) as well as the prevalence, incidence and death rate, DALY rate and 
their age-standardized rates were used to analyze the trend of the burden of 
DMVD in the Chinese population from 1990 to 2019. Results: In 2019, the number 
of patients, the number of new cases, and the number of deaths with DMVD in 
China were 461.2, 27.0 and 0.129 ten thousand, respectively, which increased by 
209.0%, 199.1% and 13.2% when compared with 1990. In 2019, the age-standardized 
prevalence, incidence and death rate were 228.1/100 000, 12.7/100 000 and 
0.075/100 000, respectively. Compared with 1990, the change of the 
age-standardized prevalence, incidence and death rate were 32.6%, 42.8% and 
-54.1%, respectively. In addition, the 2019 data also showed that the 
age-standardized prevalence and incidence were higher in females than in males 
(the age-standardized prevalence was 190.1 (181.5-198.9)/100 000 for males and 
262.0 (250.3-273.9)/100 000 for females); the age-standardized incidence was 
10.5 (10.0-11.0)/100 000 for males and 14.9 (14.3-15.6)/100 000 for females. The 
age group with the largest number of DMVD patients was 65 to 69 years old, and 
the highest incidence was 60 to 64 years old. From 1990 to 2019, DALY caused by 
DMVD showed an upward trend in China, from 46 439 person-years in 1990 to 69 402 
person-years in 2019, with an increase of 49.4%. While the age-standardized DALY 
rate continued to decline, from 5.5/100 000 in 1990 to 3.8/100 000 in 2019, with 
a drop of 30.8%. The DALY and the age-standardized DALY rate of females were 
always higher than that of males in different years. Conclusion: From 1990 to 
2019, DALY and the age-standardized prevalence and incidence of DMVD in China 
shows an increasing trend, and the disease burden caused by DMVD is severe in 
China.

Segmented negative-strand RNA bunyaviruses encode a multi-functional polymerase 
that performs genome replication and transcription. Here, we establish 
conditions for in vitro activity of La Crosse virus polymerase and visualize its 
conformational dynamics by cryo-electron microscopy, unveiling the precise 
molecular mechanics underlying its essential activities. We find that 
replication initiation is coupled to distal duplex promoter formation, 
endonuclease movement, prime-and-realign loop extension and closure of the 
polymerase core that direct the template towards the active site. Transcription 
initiation depends on C-terminal region closure and endonuclease movements that 
prompt primer cleavage prior to primer entry in the active site. Product 
realignment after priming, observed in replication and transcription, is 
triggered by the prime-and-realign loop. Switch to elongation results in 
polymerase reorganization and core region opening to facilitate template-product 
duplex formation in the active site cavity. The uncovered detailed mechanics 
should be helpful for the future design of antivirals counteracting bunyaviral 
life threatening pathogens.

A Conservative Approach to the Treatment of a Rare Case of Cervical Spine Double 
Expressor Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: A Case Report.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are a group of lymphoid neoplasms, with diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most common subtype. Genetic alterations 
involving c-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
subtypes of DLBCL with poor prognostic implications. This case report 
demonstrates a retropharyngeal mass with extension through the bilateral 
neuroforamina into the epidural space and posterior elements of the cervical 
spine (C2-C3), for which biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Here we 
present a unique case as it provides a solution for the dilemma on how to treat 
a patient with a known prior malignancy (gastrointestinal [GI] melanoma) with a 
retropharyngeal mass with epidural extension (dumbbell-shaped tumor) with an 
inconclusive initial CT-guided needle-core biopsy. A CT-guided biopsy only 
yielded that the mass was neoplasm; we had a choice between attempting gross 
total resection of the mass or open biopsy. Attempting gross total resection 
would have entailed an anterior approach (transoral with possible odontoidectomy 
or endoscopic endonasal with possible odontoidectomy) along with posterior 
instrumentation and fusion from occiput to C3, which is a rather morbid 
procedure that would subject the patient to a decreased quality of life as well 
as risks of vascular injury, dysphagia, and infection. We elected to perform an 
open biopsy of the epidural component of the mass through a decompressive 
laminectomy, which allowed for decompression of the spinal cord as well as a 
sampling of the mass. This provided treatment for possible increasing epidural 
compression from the mass, as well as diagnostic tissue. A multidisciplinary 
team discussed the case and developed a treatment plan for the patient with 
systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: Metabolic risks including high body mass index, high fasting 
plasma glucose, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high systolic blood 
pressure, kidney dysfunction and low bone mineral density, contribute heavy 
burden to the US health systems. We aimed to investigate the burden attributable 
to metabolic risks in the US from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Using methodology of Global Burden of Disease Study, the deaths and 
DALYs attributable to metabolic risks were analyzed by age, gender, states, 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and diseases from 1990 to 2019 in the US.
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized death and DALY rates attributable to 
metabolic risks were 174.9 and 4738.7 per 100,000 people, accounting for 33.1% 
and 18.2% of death and DALY rates from all causes in the US, and there was a 
decrease by -32.5% and -21.2% in age-standardized death and DALY rates since 
1990. The burden attributable to metabolic risks increased with age, and was 
higher in males than females. In addition, the burden varied widely across the 
states, generally in inverse proportion to the SDI levels, and the heaviest 
burden was observed in East and West South-Central of the US. Cardiovascular 
diseases carried heavy burden attributable to metabolic risks.
CONCLUSION: The burden attributable to metabolic risks remained major public 
health concerns in the US. Prevention of metabolic risks should be a high 
priority in the US.

In this study, our main objective is to find the impact of FDI and external debt 
on health outcomes in emerging Asian economies from 1991 to 2019. To that end, 
we have collected data for seven economies: Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, 
Thailand, Sri Lanka, China, and India. We have relied on the panel ARDL (PARDL) 
method for empirical analysis. The study's findings confirmed that the debt has 
increased infant mortality and decreased life expectancy in emerging Asian 
economies in the long run. On the other side, the FDI causes infant mortality to 
fall and life expectancy to rise in the long run in emerging Asian economies. 
Similarly, the health expenditures also reduced the infant mortality rate, 
though the impact is insignificant, and improved the life expectancy in emerging 
Asian economies. The causal analysis confirmed the two-way causality between 
health expenditure, infant mortality, and health expenditure and debt.

BACKGROUND: Swimming is used for rehabilitation and conditioning purposes in 
equine sports medicine. We described the swimming kinematics of the equine 
forelimbs in Part 1. The aim of Part 2 is to assess stifle, tarsus, and hind 
fetlock joints kinematics in swimming horses. The objectives were 1- to 
calculate and compare joint angles during swimming against passive mobilizations 
(PM), 2- to determine joints angular velocities during a swimming stride cycle.
METHODS: Eleven elite endurance horses were used to swim in a 100-meter straight 
pool. Underwater (swimming) and overground PM videos were recorded from the 
horses' left side. Joint markers were applied on the lateral hoof wall, lateral 
metatarsal epicondyle, lateral aspect of the talus, lateral femoral epicondyle, 
and great trochanter of the femur. As a reference, maximal fetlock, tarsus, and 
stifle flexion/extension angles were determined during PM overground. 
Differences between angle extrema, angular velocities, and range of motion (ROM) 
were statistically compared.
RESULTS: The tarsus ROM was similar during PM and swimming. The stifle and 
fetlock ROM were greater during PM, although the stifle flexion was greater 
during swimming. The stifle and tarsus had the greatest hindlimb angular 
velocity during the swimming cycle. Greater angular velocities were observed 
during the retraction phase for all the hindlimb joints.
CONCLUSION: A short retraction phase with great angular velocity for the joints 
of interest characterized the swimming pattern observed. Swimming may be 
beneficial in horses when an increased ROM of the tarsus and stifle or a reduced 
fetlock extension is indicated for rehabilitation purposes.

BACKGROUND: Risankizumab has demonstrated durable, high rates of efficacy in 
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as assessed by the achievement 
of relative Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement and Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this post hoc analysis is to assess the achievement of 
absolute PASI thresholds and related improvements in health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with 
(i) risankizumab compared with ustekinumab, and (ii) long-term (>52 weeks to 
172 weeks) risankizumab.
METHODS: Data from patients randomised to 150 mg risankizumab or 45 or 90 mg 
ustekinumab in replicate randomised controlled trials UltIMMa-1 and UltIMMa-2 
were analysed for the achievement of absolute PASI thresholds PASI ≤ 3, PASI ≤ 
1, and PASI = 0, time to achieve these thresholds, and combined PASI and DLQI 
endpoints. Data from pat ients initially randomised to risankizumab who 
continued on risankizumab in the open-label extension study LIMMitless were 
analysed for the achievement of absolute PASI levels, mean DLQI scores, and DLQI 
0/1.
RESULTS: Significantly greater proportions of patients treated with risankizumab 
compared with ustekinumab achieved PASI ≤ 3, PASI ≤ 1, and PASI = 0, as well as 
combined endpoints for absolute PASI and DLQI [(PASI ≤ 3 and DLQI ≤ 5) or (PASI 
≤ 1 and DLQI 0/1)]. The median time to first achieve PASI ≤ 3, PASI ≤ 1, and 
PASI = 0 was significantly lower for risankizumab-treated patients compared with 
ustekinumab-treated patients. Among patients treated with long-term 
risankizumab, more than 90% achieved PASI ≤ 3 though week 172 and more than 80% 
achieved DLQI 0/1. Low absolute PASI scores corresponded with low mean absolute 
DLQI scores through week 172 of continuous risankizumab treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Risankizumab treatment demonstrated high rates of rapid and durable 
efficacy as measured by absolute PASI thresholds and improvements in patient 
HRQoL.

Carbon dots (CDs) have two unique advantages: one is ease of synthesis at low 
price, the other is desirable physical and chemical properties, such as 
ultra-small size, abundant surface functional groups, nontoxic/low-toxicity, 
good biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial and antioxidant activities etc. 
These advantages provide opportunities for the development of new food packaging 
enhancers and food preservatives. This paper systematically reviews the studies 
of CDs used to strengthen the physical properties of food packaging, including 
strengthen mechanical strength, ultraviolet (UV) barrier properties and water 
barrier properties. It also reviews the researches of CDs used to fabricate 
active packaging with antioxidant and/or antibacterial properties and 
intelligent packaging with the capacity of sensing the freshness of food. In 
addition, it analyzes the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of CDs as 
preservatives, and discusses the effect of CDs applied as coating agents and 
nano-level food additives for extension the shelf life of food samples. It also 
provides a brief review on the security and the release behavior of CDs.

Plain Language Summary: Collect and analyze the effect of CDs on enhancing the 
physical properties of protective food packaging.Discuss the active of CDs and 
their application in active intelligent packaging.Analyze the application of CDs 
as coating agent and nano-level food additives.Discuss the security of CDs, 
including toxicity and the release behavior.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the responsiveness of the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Clinical Functioning Information Tool 
(ClinFIT) in routine clinical practice in an Australian context.
METHODS: A prospective observational study with consecutive recruitment of 
inpatients at a tertiary rehabilitation facility. The assessments were at 
admission (T0), discharge (T1) and 3-month postdischarge (T2), using the 
following questionnaires: ClinFIT, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and 
European Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L). Extension Indices (EI) were calculated for 
the ClinFIT set, and responsiveness measured as a change in scores over time. 
The association between FIM and ClinFIT scores was explored.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 91, mean age 66.8±13.0 years, 52% male, 48% following 
stroke) reported ≥ 1 issue related to ClinFIT categories. ClinFIT total raw 
scores improved significantly across all health conditions compared with T0 
(median (interquartile range): 196 (110, 228)) at both T1: 69 (37, 110); p < 
0.001 and T2: 46.5 (20.8, 77); p < 0.001, with a medium effect size (r = 0.61 
for both). There were significant changes in EI in the entire ClinFIT set from 
T0 to T1, and from T0 to T2 (p < 0.001 for both), with small to medium effect 
sizes. Analyses confirmed significant correlation in improvements between 
ClinFIT and FIM scores.
CONCLUSION: ClinFIT is useful in evaluating patient functioning and can detect 
changes in functioning over time and across different health conditions.

As human life expectancy increases, neurodegenerative diseases present a growing 
public health threat, for which there are currently few effective treatments. 
There is an urgent need to understand the molecular and genetic underpinnings of 
these disorders so new therapeutic targets can be identified. Here we present 
the argument that the simple nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful 
tool to rapidly study neurodegenerative disorders due to their short lifespan 
and vast array of genetic tools, which can be combined with characterization of 
conserved neuronal processes and behavior orthologous to those disrupted in 
human disease. We review how pre-existing C. elegans models provide insight into 
human neurological disease as well as an overview of current tools available to 
study neurodegenerative diseases in the worm, with an emphasis on genetics and 
behavior. We also discuss open questions that C. elegans may be particularly 
well suited for in future studies and how worms will be a valuable preclinical 
model to better understand these devastating neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND: By explaining the development of health inequalities, eco-social 
theories highlight the importance of social environments that children are 
embedded in. The most important environment during early childhood is the 
family, as it profoundly influences children's health through various 
characteristics. These include family processes, family structure/size, and 
living conditions, and are closely linked to the socioeconomic position (SEP) of 
the family. Although it is known that the SEP contributes to health inequalities 
in early childhood, the effects of family characteristics on health inequalities 
remain unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to synthesise existing 
research on the mediating and moderating effects of family characteristics on 
socioeconomic health inequalities (HI) during early childhood in high-income 
countries.
METHODS: This review followed the methodology of "Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews". To identify 
German and English scientific peer-reviewed literature published from January 
1st, 2000, to December 19th, 2019, the following search term blocks were linked 
with the logical operator "AND": (1) family structure/size, processes, living 
conditions, (2) inequalities, disparities, diversities, (3) income, education, 
occupation, (4) health and (5) young children. The search covered the electronic 
databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus.
RESULTS: The search yielded 7,089 records. After title/abstract and full-text 
screening, only ten peer-reviewed articles were included in the synthesis, which 
analysed the effects of family characteristics on HI in early childhood. Family 
processes (i.e., rules /descriptive norms, stress, parental screen time, 
parent-child conflicts) are identified to have mediating or moderating effects. 
While families' living conditions (i.e., TVs in children's bedrooms) are 
suggested as mediating factors, family structure/size (i.e., single parenthood, 
number of children in the household) appear to moderate health inequalities.
CONCLUSION: Family characteristics contribute to health inequalities in early 
childhood. The results provide overall support of models of family stress and 
family investment. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the role of family 
health literacy, regarding a wide range of children's health outcomes (e.g., 
oral health, inflammation parameters, weight, and height), and the development 
of health inequalities over the life course starting at birth.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of dapagliflozin, as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SoC), for 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Spain, based on the results 
of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model (Cardiff T2DM) based on the data 
observed in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial was adapted to the Spanish setting to 
estimate the costs and health outcomes of treatment with dapagliflozin in 
patients with T2DM who had or were at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. Macrovascular events (hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and unstable angina), end-stage renal disease and 
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality were modeled according to the 
survival equations of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study. Microvascular events (blindness 
and ulcers) were estimated based on the risk equations of the UK Prospective 
Diabetes Study. The analysis was conducted from the Spanish National Health 
System perspective and the time horizon was 30 years. The results were evaluated 
in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Only direct 
health costs were included, and a 3% discount rate was applied to costs and 
health outcomes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were 
made to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In the main analysis, dapagliflozin was a dominant therapeutic option 
compared with placebo, with greater effectiveness (0.08 QALYs) and lower 
associated total costs per patient (€ -2,921). The univariate sensitivity 
analysis and the PSA confirmed the robustness of the results. The PSA showed the 
probability that dapagliflozin was a dominant alternative compared with placebo 
was 84.2% and that it was cost-effective of 92.1%, under a willingness-to-pay of 
€ 20,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial shows that 
dapagliflozin would be a cost-effective option in Spain for the treatment of 
adult patients with T2DM, as an add-on therapy to SoC, compared with placebo.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is a head-to-head comparison of the instrument 
performance and responsiveness of the EQ-5D-Y-3L and the expanded English 
version of the EQ-5D-Y-5L in children/adolescents receiving acute orthopaedic 
management in South Africa.
METHODS: Children/adolescents aged 8-15 years completed the EQ-5D-Y-5L, 
EQ-5D-Y-3L, self-rated health (SRH) question and PedsQL at baseline. The 
EQ-5D-Y-5L, EQ-5D-Y-3L and SRH question were repeated after 24 and 48 h. 
Performance of the EQ-5D-Y-5L and EQ-5D-Y-3L was determined by comparing 
feasibility (missing responses), redistribution of dimensions responses, 
discriminatory power, concurrent validity, and responsiveness.
RESULTS: Eighty-three children/adolescents completed baseline measures and 
seventy-one at all three time-points. Reporting of 11111 decreased by 20% from 
the EQ-5D-Y-3L to the EQ-5D-Y-5L. Informativity of dimensions improved on 
average by 0.267 on the EQ-5D-Y-5L with similar evenness. There was a range of 
11-27% inconsistent responses when moving from the EQ-5D-Y-3L to the EQ-5D-Y-5L. 
There was a low to moderate and significant association on the EQ-5D-Y-3L and 
EQ-5D-Y-5L to similar items on the PedsQL and SRH scores. Percentage change over 
time was greater for the EQ-5D-Y-5L (range 0-182%) than EQ-5D-Y-3L (range 
0-100%) with the largest reduction for both measures between 0 and 48 h. For 
those who respondents who showed an improved SRH the EQ-5D-Y-5L and EQ-5D-Y-3L 
showed significant paired differences.
CONCLUSION: The English version of the EQ-5D-Y-5L appears to be a valid and 
responsive extension of the EQ-5D-Y-3L for children receiving acute orthopaedic 
management. The expanded levels notably reduce the ceiling effect and has 
greater discriminatory power. Concurrent validity of the EQ-5D-Y-3L and 
EQ-5D-Y-5L was low to moderate with similar PedsQL items and SRH. The EQ-5D-Y-5L 
generally showed greater change than the EQ-5D-Y-3L across all dimensions with 
the greatest change observed for 0-48 h. Responsiveness was comparable across 
the EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L for those with improved SRH. Greater sensitivity 
to change may be observed on comparison of utility scores, once preference-based 
value sets are available for the EQ-5D-Y-5L.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity across the globe. 
Providing comprehensive data on the burden of stroke in the Middle East and 
North Africa (MENA) could be useful for health policy makers in the region. 
Therefore, this article reported the burden of stroke and its attributable risk 
factors between 1990 and 2019 by age, sex, type of stroke, and socio-demographic 
index. Data on the point prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), due to stroke, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease study 
2019 for the 21 countries located in the MENA region from 1990 to 2019. The 
counts and age-standardised rates (per 100,000) were presented, along with their 
corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2019, the regional 
age-standardised point prevalence and death rates of stroke were 1537.5 (95% UI: 
1421.9-1659.9) and 87.7 (78.2-97.6) per 100,000, which represent a 0.5% (- 2.3 
to 1.1) and 27.8% (- 35.4 to - 16) decrease since 1990, respectively. Moreover, 
the regional age-standardised DALY rate in 2019 was 1826.2 (1635.3-2026.2) per 
100,000, a 32.0% (- 39.1 to - 23.3) decrease since 1990. In 2019, Afghanistan 
[3498.2 (2508.8-4500.4)] and Lebanon [752.9 (593.3-935.9)] had the highest and 
lowest age-standardised DALY rates, respectively. Regionally, the total number 
of stroke cases were highest in the 60-64 age group and was more prevalent in 
women in all age groups. In addition, there was a general negative association 
between SDI and the burden of stoke from 1990 to 2019. Also, in 2019, high 
systolic blood pressure [53.5%], high body mass index [39.4%] and ambient 
particulate air pollution [27.1%] made the three largest contributions to the 
burden of stroke in the MENA region. The stroke burden has decreased in the MENA 
region over the last three decades, although there are large inter-country 
differences. Preventive programs should be implemented which focus on metabolic 
risk factors, especially among older females in low SDI countries.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem, and prevalence rates are expected 
to rise as life expectancy increases worldwide. In more severe cases of ED, 
penile prosthesis implantation has been an excellent option for patients. Over 
the past few decades, significant design improvements have been made to the 
penile prosthesis and modifications to surgical technique to improve clinical 
outcomes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the safety and efficacy of 
FDA-approved penile implants in the US market. Design modifications have greatly 
improved the safety and reliability of the implant. Development of improved 
surgical techniques has decreased intraoperative injuries and reservoir-related 
complications. With its high overall satisfaction rates and low risk of 
complications, the inflatable penile prosthesis remains an excellent option for 
patients with erectile dysfunction.

Hypopharyngeal carcinoma is usually present at late stages, necessitating an 
aggressive line of management consisting of surgical procedures, chemotherapy, 
and radiation therapy, depending on the case. Practitioners tend to support 
total laryngectomies or total esophagostomies for most cases of hypopharyngeal 
carcinoma. The extensive procedures needed will most probably require, depending 
on the residual defect, a follow-up reconstructive procedure that might require 
utilizing flaps. Types of reconstructive methods and types of grafts or flaps 
used could be divided into a multitude of categories depending on the magnitude, 
shape, extension, and whether the underlying defect that is being reconstructed 
is circumferential or not. These reconstructive procedures are aimed at 
improving the quality of life, improving the aesthetic outcome, and restoring 
the functionality of the pharyngoesophageal segment. When it comes to 
hypopharyngeal cancer, the most common kind is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 
which has the worst prognosis of all the head and neck malignancies. Overall, 
the 5-year survival rate remains low, despite recent advancements in diagnostic 
imaging, radiation, and chemotherapy, as well as enhanced surgical methods and 
techniques. Hypopharyngeal malignancies are more probable than other tumors to 
present with advanced primary illness, with nodal metastasis a distinct 
possibility. The size and amount of local dissemination of the original 
carcinoma, as well as the extent of involvement of regional lymph nodes, are the 
most critical factors in predicting prognosis. Hypopharyngeal cancers are more 
likely than other head and neck cancers to manifest with distant metastases at 
the time of diagnosis. The appearance of second primary tumors, as well as the 
development of distant metastases, is a contributing factor to poor survival 
rate. Imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with contrast remain the gold standard for evaluating 
hypopharyngeal carcinoma in the early stages. In most cases, imaging leads to an 
increase in the tumor stage at the time of presentation. Objectives. The main 
objectives are to review the research published about flaps, outline the optimum 
situations that will dictate the usage of a few of the most often used flaps for 
the rebuilding of the hypopharyngeal segment defects, and outline some of the 
complications associated with reconstruction. Methods. The processing was 
carried out with the title-specific search of the PubMed database using the
