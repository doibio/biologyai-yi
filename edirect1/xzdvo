RESULTS: SOBI003 was generally well tolerated. Serum concentrations of SOBI003 
increased in proportion to dose, and presence in CSF confirmed that SOBI003 
crosses the BBB. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in serum and CSF in 
all patients, with subsequent reductions in serum SOBI003 exposure at high ADA 
titers. SOBI003 exerted a clear PD effect: a mean reduction in HS levels in CSF 
of 79% was recorded at the last assessment, together with reductions in HS 
levels in serum and urine. Neurocognitive development age-equivalent scores 
showed a stabilization of cognition for all patients, whereas no clear overall 
clinical effect was observed on adaptive behavior, sleep pattern or quality of 
life.
CONCLUSION: SOBI003 was well tolerated when administered as weekly intravenous 
infusions at doses of up to 20 mg/kg for up to 104 weeks. ADA development was 
common and likely affected both PK and PD parameters. SOBI003 crossed the BBB 
and showed pharmacological activity on HS in CSF.

OBJECTIVE: The use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) has increased dramatically over the past 
decade. ECPR is resource intensive and costly, presenting challenges for 
policymakers. We sought to review the cost-effectiveness of ECPR compared with 
conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) in OHCA.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Tufts CEA registry and NHS EED databases 
from database inception to 2021 or 2015 for NHS EED. Cochrane Covidence was used 
to screen and assess studies. Data on costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of 
included studies were extracted by two independent reviewers. Costs were 
converted to USD using purchasing power parities (OECD, 2022).1 The Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist (Husereau et 
al., 2022)2 was used for reporting quality and completeness of 
cost-effectiveness studies; the review was registered on PROSPERO, and reported 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS: Four studies met the inclusion criteria; three cost-effectiveness 
studies reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for OHCA 
compared with conventional care, and one reported the mean operating cost of 
ECPR. ECPR was more costly, accrued more life years (LY) and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) than CCPR and was more cost-effective when compared with CCPR 
and other standard therapies. Overall study quality was rated as moderate.
CONCLUSION: Few studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of ECPR for OHCA. 
Of those, ECPR for OHCA was cost-effective. Further studies are required to 
validate findings and assess the cost-effectiveness of establishing a new ECPR 
service or alternate ECPR delivery models.

Chemical agents are effective treatment methods for anthracnose induced by 
pathogenic Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on Stylosanthes. However, excess 
consumption of chemical agents destroys the environment, synthetic biology was 
capable of conquering the issue. The antifungal agent is developed by enclosing 
a bio-synthesized peptide aptamer with layered montmorillonite via electrostatic 
interaction. Compared with free peptide aptamer, the nanocomposite exhibits 
higher antifungal activity against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, further 
improving the utilization of peptide aptamer. The nanocomposite killed 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides by releasing peptide aptamer after they entered 
the spore. Moreover, montmorillonite enhances the adhesion ability of peptide 
aptamer via hydrophobic interactions between nanomaterials and leaves, 
prolonging the extension time of nanocomposite on leaves. Consequently, 0.1 mg 
of nanocomposite demonstrates a comparable effect to commercial carbendazim 
(1 %) to prevent anthracnose on leaves of Stylosanthes induced by HK-04 at room 
temperature. This work demonstrates an alternative to commercial antifungal 
agents and proposes a versatile approach to preparing environmental-friendly 
antifungal agents to inhibit fungal infections on crops.

Has the share of the working life expectancy that is spent receiving a partial 
or full disability pension changed in Finland over the period 2005-2018? A 
longitudinal register-based study.

OBJECTIVES: The share of the overall working careers that is spent receiving 
disability benefits is unclear. We examined trends in full-time equivalent 
working life expectancy (FTE-WLE) among those with and without receiving a 
permanent full or partial disability pension in Finland, where certain amounts 
of work are allowed while receiving these pensions.
DESIGN: Longitudinal register-based study.
SETTING: Finnish population.
PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative 70% samples of the working-age 
population.
OUTCOME: Using the Sullivan method, we examined annual FTE-WLE at age 45, 
truncated at age 63, in 2005-2018 by disability pension status. Full-time 
equivalent work participation was based on combined information on annual 
employment days and work income.
RESULTS: Compared with those with no disability pension, disability pensioners 
had a larger relative (full and partial pensioners of both genders) and absolute 
(male partial pensioners) increase in the FTE-WLE between 2005 and 2018. In 
2018, the FTE-WLE of both male and female full disability pensioners was around 
3.5 months, being 6 months at its highest in musculoskeletal diseases. The 
FTE-WLE of partial disability pensioners was around 6.5 and 8 years among men 
and women, respectively, being around half of the corresponding expectancies of 
non-pensioners. The FTE-WLE of partial disability pensioners was considerable in 
musculoskeletal diseases and mental disorders and even higher in other diseases. 
Full disability pensioners spent a disproportionately large time in manual work, 
increasingly in the private sector, and partial pensioners in the public sector 
with lower non-manual and manual work, increasingly with the former. At the 
population level, the share of the FTE-WLE that is spent receiving a disability 
pension remained relatively small.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased work participation while receiving a disability pension 
is likely to have had important implications for prolonging individual working 
careers but only minor contribution to the length of working lives at the 
population level.

NSCLC is the first cause of cancer-related deaths in China and threatens life 
expectancy of the people. Novel drugs and treatment strategies are urgently 
required. Capsaicin is noticed as a potential new drug for lots of tumors due to 
its anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells. Our study evaluated the roles of 
capsaicin in NSCLC cells (A549 and NCI-H23) and further explored its underlying 
mechanisms. Effect of capsaicin treatment on cell viability was determined by 
MTT assay and IC50 values for A549 and NCI-H23 cells were ascertained. The iron 
kit detected the total iron levels and the ferric divalent ions levels in A549 
and NCI-H23 cells. GSH kit was used to detect the expression of GSH in A549 and 
NCI-H23 cells. Additionally, mRNA and protein levels of SLC7A11 and GPX4 were 
analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Through MTT assay, we found 
that 200 μM capsaicin in cultured A549 cells for 48 h could reach the IC50 
value, and the condition was 100 μM and 48 h for NCI-H23 cells. Capsaicin 
increased total iron levels and ferrous ion levels in A549 and NCI-H23 cells in 
contrast with the control group, whereas the levels of GSH was reduced in 
contrast with the control group. Besides, mRNA and protein levels of SLC7A11 and 
GPX4 were decreased significantly in A549 and NCI-H23 cells treated with 
capsaicin in contrast with the control group. Our study indicated that capsaicin 
inhibited the proliferation of A549 and NCI-H23 cells and induced ferroptosis by 
inactivating SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling. Capsaicin could be used as a potential 
anticancer agent in the treatment of NSCLC.

With the exception of HIV-associated lipodystrophy, lipodystrophy syndromes are 
rare conditions characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, which is not 
generally recovered. As a consequence, an ectopic deposition of lipids 
frequently occurs, which usually leads to insulin resistance, atherogenic 
dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. These disorders include certain accelerated 
aging syndromes or progeroid syndromes. Even though each of them has unique 
clinical features, most show common clinical characteristics that affect growth, 
skin and appendages, adipose tissue, muscle, and bone and, in some of them, life 
expectancy is reduced. Although the molecular bases of these Mendelian disorders 
are very diverse and not well known, genomic instability is frequent as a 
consequence of impairment of nuclear organization, chromatin structure, and DNA 
repair, as well as epigenetic dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In 
this review, the main clinical features of the lipodystrophy-associated 
progeroid syndromes will be described along with their causes and pathogenic 
mechanisms, and an attempt will be made to identify which of López-Otín's 
hallmarks of aging are present.

BACKGROUND: Research has generally found a significant inverse relationship in 
mortality risk across socioeconomic (SE) groups. This paper focuses on Spain, a 
country for which there continues to be very little evidence available 
concerning retirement pensioners. We draw on the Continuous Sample of Working 
Lives (CSWL) to investigate disparities in SE mortality among retired men aged 
65 and above over the longest possible period covered by this data source: 
2005-2018. We use the initial pension income (PI) level as our single indicator 
of the SE status of the retired population.
METHODS: The mortality gradient by income is quantified in two ways: via an 
indicator referred to as "relative mortality", and by estimating changes in 
total life expectancy (LE) by PI level at ages 65 and 75 over time. We show 
that, should the information provided by the relative mortality ratio not be 
completely clear, a second indicator needs to be introduced to give a broad 
picture of the true extent of inequality in mortality.
RESULTS: The first indicator reveals that, for the period covered and for all 
age groups, the differences in death rates across PI levels widens over time. At 
older age groups, these differences across PI levels diminish. The second 
indicator shows that disparities in LE at ages 65 and 75 between pensioners in 
the lowest and highest income groups are relatively small, although slightly 
higher than previously reported for Spain. This gap in LE widens over time, from 
1.49 to 2.54 years and from 0.71 to 1.40 years respectively for pensioners aged 
65 and 75. These differences are statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Along with other behavioral and structural aspects, a combination 
of factors such as the design of the pension system, the universality and 
quality of the health system, and high levels of family support could explain 
why LE inequalities for retired Spanish men are relatively small. To establish 
the reasons for this increased inequality in LE, more research needs to be 
carried out. An analysis of all Spanish social security records instead of just 
a sample would provide us with more information.

OBJECTIVES: Along with the development of the times and progress of the society, 
the total fertility rate (TFR) markedly changed in each country. Therefore, it 
is critical to describe the trend of TFR and explore its influencing factors. 
However, previous studies did not consider the time lag and cumulative effect in 
the associations between the influencing factors and TFR. Thus, our study aimed 
to analyze the associations from a new dimension.
METHODS: The study was employed using national-level data from the World Bank 
and United Nations Development Programme. Distributed lag non-linear models with 
5-year lag were used to examine the independent associations between the 
relevant factors and TFR.
RESULTS: The cumulative exposure-TFR curves were inverted U-shaped for log gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita and life expectancy at birth, while the 
cumulative exposure-response curves were approximately linear for female 
expected years of schooling and human development index (HDI). However, it is 
worth noting that in the developed regions, TFR increased slightly with the high 
level of GDP per capita, female expected years of schooling and HDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Nowadays, with the growth of GDP per capita, life expectancy at 
birth, female expected years of schooling and HDI, TFR are on a drastic downward 
trend in most regions. Besides, with the development of society, when levels of 
the factors continued to increase, TFR also showed a slight rebound. Therefore, 
governments, especially those in developing countries, should take measures to 
stimulate fertility and deal with a series of problems caused by declining TFR.

Is State-Wise Healthcare Budget Allocation Consistent With the Disease Burden in 
India? A Quinquennial Account (2015-2019).

Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, India.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence-based resource allocation may help to achieve immense 
health gains in resource-limited settings like India. Understanding healthcare 
expenditure and the corresponding disease burden could provide insights to plan 
optimal allocation of limited resources. Hence, we aimed to investigate the 
status and trends of state-wise healthcare budget allocation and the 
corresponding disease burden.
METHODS: We retrieved state-wise healthcare budget allocation information in 
India for the years 2015 to 2019. Corresponding state-wise 
disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of 
Disease, injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) was used to measure disease 
burden. The allocated budget (in rupees) per DALY was calculated for overall, 
communicable, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Descriptive statistics, 
correlation and graphical representations were used to identify and evaluate the 
trends and relationships between state-wise health budget allocation and disease 
burden.
RESULTS: The allocated budget per DALY in 2019 was highest for Goa ( 34,260 or 
US$ 486.66) and lowest for Bihar ( 2,408 or US $ 34.20). Smaller, less populous 
states had higher budget allocations per DALY than larger states. Health budget 
allocation had an inverse relationship with infectious diseases and an identical 
linear relationship with NCDs. Most state-wise health budget allocations, as 
well as total disease burden, increased over the years except for Assam, 
Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh. Also, such trends are not similar for the 
injuries and NCD disease burden.
DISCUSSION: The health budget allocation is variable across states as well as 
between infectious and NCDs. The current increase in the allocated budget is 
incongruent with the increasing disease burden. There is a need for rapid 
expansion of healthcare resource allocation guided by evidence in India.

Non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, are the leading 
cause of decreased life expectancy and death in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Although a lifestyle, which includes no tobacco use, good nutrition, and regular 
physical activity is touted as key to health, the environmental, racial, social 
and economic conditions, which underpin lifestyle are often ignored or 
considered only secondarily. Placing the main responsibility on a patient to 
change their lifestyle or to simply comply with pharmacological treatment 
ignores the specific conditions in which the individual lives. Furthermore, 
there are major disparities in access to both healthy living conditions as well 
as access to medical care. There is sufficient evidence to support advocating 
for policies that support healthy living, particularly healthy food choices. 
Progress is being made to improve the food environment with enactment of front 
of package nutritional labels. However, policies were enacted only after intense 
regional research and advocacy supporting their implementation. Government 
officials must rise above the pressures of commercial interests and support 
health-promoting policies or be exposed as self-interest groups themselves. 
Strong advocacy is required to persuade officials that all policies should take 
health into consideration both to improve lives and economies.

Novel insights in fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis.

Comes A(1), Sofia C, Richeldi L.

del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis, the transition from the 
inflammatory to the fibrotic stage of the lungs occurs in about 10-20% of cases, 
eventually causing end-stage fibrotic disease. To date, pathogenetic mechanisms 
and clinical management remain challenging; thus, we highlight the recent 
evidence in pulmonary fibrotic processes, clinical signs for an early detection 
and the potential role of the current investigated antifibrotic agents and 
promising targeted therapies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings of relevant key cellular pathways can be 
considered as a glimmer of light in the complexity of sarcoidosis. In some 
patients, granulomas persist and serve as a nidus for fibrosis growth, sustained 
by several fibrosis-stimulating cytokines. Preclinical studies have detected 
profibrotic, antifibrotic and pleiotropic T cells as promoters of fibrosis. 
Epigenetics, genetics and transcriptomics research can lead to new target 
therapies. Antifibrotic drug nintedanib has shown a positive effect on 
non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis fibrotic lung diseases including fibrotic 
sarcoidosis; other antifibrotic drugs are under investigation.
SUMMARY: Pulmonary fibrosis strongly impacts the outcome of sarcoidosis, and a 
better understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms can facilitate the 
development of novel treatments, improving clinical care and life expectancy of 
these patients. The greatest challenge is to investigate effective antifibrotic 
therapies once fibrosis develops. The role of these findings in fibrotic 
sarcoidosis can be translated into other interstitial lung diseases 
characterized by the coexistence of inflammatory and fibrotic processes.

BACKGROUND: Congenital conditions comprise a significant portion of the global 
burden of surgical conditions in children. In Somaliland, over 250,000 children 
do not receive required surgical care annually, although the estimated costs and 
benefits of scale-up of children's surgical services to address this disease 
burden is not known.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model using a decision tree template to project 
the costs and benefits of scale-up of surgical care for children across 
Somaliland. We used a proxy set of congenital anomalies across Somaliland to 
estimate scale-up costs using three different scale-up rates. The 
cost-effectiveness ratio and net societal monetary benefit were estimated using 
these models, supported by disability weights in existing literature.
RESULTS: Overall, we found that scale-up of surgical services at an aggressive 
rate (22.5%) over a 10-year time horizon is cost effective. Although the 
scale-up of surgical care for most conditions in the proxy set was cost 
effective, scale-up of hydrocephalus and spina bifida are not as cost effective 
as other conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis concludes that it is cost effective to scale-up 
surgical services for congenital anomalies for children in Somaliland.

Adoptive cell treatment (ACT) utilizing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) diverts 
the specificity of safe cells against a target-specific antigen and portrays 
exceptional potential for cancer treatment. While CAR T cell treatment has risen 
as a breakthrough with unprecedented results within the therapeutic procedures 
of human malignancies, different deficiencies including challenging and costly 
generation processes, strict patient qualification criteria, and undesirable 
toxicity have ruined its application. Unlike T cells, the application of natural 
killer (NK) cells has attracted consideration as a reasonable alternative owing 
to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independency, shorter life 
expectancy, the potential to create an off-the-shelf immune product, and potent 
antitumor properties. In this article, we provide an updated review of the 
differences between CAR T and CAR NK cells, current enhancements in CAR NK 
design, the available sources for collecting NK cells, and strategies for the 
transduction step of the CARs to NK cells. Furthermore, we focus on the 
published and ongoing preclinical and clinical studies of CAR NK treatment 
strategies both in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We also discuss 
limitations and plausible solutions to improve the perseverance, function, 
safety, and efficacy of CAR NK cells with a special focus on solid tumors.

2-Methylimidazole (MIM) is a classic organic ligand that shows excellent thermal 
stability and chemical robustness and is widely used in ZIFs. Recently, 
transformations of MOFs have been realized by using metals or ligands. In this 
study, we propose a new strategy-adjusting MIM by extending the alkyl chain 
length -to change the properties of related MOFs. Furthermore, we used copper as 
the metal core to replace zinc to mimic the active sites of laccases (electron 
transfer between copper and imidazole ring). As a result, the nanostructures 
transformed from nanoleaves to nanovesicles, which changed the Cu(II)/Cu(I) 
ratio from 3.7 to 1.7, as well as the lattice constant (decreased the 
diffraction angle) and enzyme-like activity (inhibition). In addition, we 
revealed that superoxidase anions were the main factors responsible for its 
laccase-like activity. We applied it to detect and discriminate phenolics. 
Laccase-mimicking activity was best at pH 7.0. When compared to protein laccase, 
the Cu-MeIm nanozyme had a greater Vmax at the same mass concentration. It was 
used to identify and distinguish phenolics. In the presence of Cu-MeIm 
nanozymes, the linear range is 0.1-2 mM and the detection limit of 2,4-DCP is 
0.034 mM.

BACKGROUND: The most effective treatment for advanced AIDS-associated Kaposi 
sarcoma is paclitaxel or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD); neither is 
routinely used in sub-Saharan Africa due to limited availability and high cost. 
We examined the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel or 
PLD in Kenya, compared with etoposide or bleomycin-vincristine.
METHODS: In this study, we use the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS 
Complications (CEPAC)-International Model to project clinical outcomes and costs 
among people living with HIV and advanced Kaposi sarcoma on antiretroviral 
therapy. We compared four different treatment strategies: etoposide, 
bleomycin-vincristine, paclitaxel, or PLD. We derived cohort characteristics and 
costs from the Kenyan Academic Model for Providing Access to Healthcare network, 
and adverse events, efficacy, and mortality from clinical trials. We projected 
model outcomes over a lifetime and included life expectancy, per-person lifetime 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We conducted budget 
impact analysis for 5-year total costs and did deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in input parameters.
FINDINGS: We found that paclitaxel would be more effective than 
bleomycin-vincristine and would increase life expectancy by 4·2 years per 
person. PLD would further increase life expectancy by 0·6 years per person. 
Paclitaxel would be the most cost-effective strategy (ICER US$380 per 
year-of-life-saved compared with bleomycin-vincristine) and would remain 
cost-effective across a range of scenarios. PLD would be cost-effective compared 
with paclitaxel if its price were reduced to $100 per cycle (base case $180 per 
cycle). Implementing paclitaxel instead of bleomycin-vincristine would save 
approximately 6400 life-years and would increase the overall 5-year Kenyan 
health-care costs by $3·7 million; increased costs would be primarily related to 
ongoing HIV care given improved survival.
INTERPRETATION: Paclitaxel would substantially increase life expectancy and be 
cost-effective compared with bleomycin-vincristine for advanced AIDS-associated 
Kaposi sarcoma in Kenya and should be the standard of care. PLD would further 
improve survival and be cost-effective with a 44% price reduction.

PURPOSE: A subset of patients with oligometastatic cancer experience early 
widespread cancer dissemination and do not benefit from metastasis-directed 
therapy such as SABR. This study aimed to identify factors associated with early 
polymetastatic relapse (PMR).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The SABR-5 trial was a single arm phase 2 study conducted 
at all 6 regional cancer centers across British Columbia (BC), Canada. SABR for 
oligometastases was only offered on trial. Patients with up to 5 oligometastatic 
lesions (total, progressing, or induced) received SABR to all lesions. Patients 
were 18 years of age or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2 and 
life expectancy ≥6 months. This secondary analysis evaluated factors associated 
with early PMR, defined as disease recurrence within 6 months of SABR, which is 
not amenable to further local treatment. Univariable and multivariable analyses 
were performed using binary logistic regression. The Kaplan-Meier method and 
log-rank tests assessed PMR-free survival and differences between risk groups, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Between November 2016 and July 2020, 381 patients underwent treatment 
on SABR-5. A total of 16% of patients experienced PMR. Worse performance status 
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1-2 vs 0; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.01, 
P = .018), nonprostate/breast histology (HR = 3.64, P <.001), and 
oligoprogression (HR = 3.84, P <.001) were independent predictors for early PMR. 
Risk groups were identified with median PMR-free survival ranging from 5 months 
to not yet reached at the time of analysis. Rates of 3-year overall survival 
were 0%, 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-58), 77% (95% CI, 73-81), and 93% 
(95% CI, 90-96) in groups 1 to 4, respectively (P <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Four distinct risk groups for early PMR are identified, which 
differ significantly in PMR-free survival and overall survival. The group with 
all 3 risk factors had a median PMR-free survival of 5 months and may not 
benefit from local ablative therapy alone. This model should be externally 
validated with data from other prospective trials.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery programs have improved patient 
outcomes following colorectal surgery. This has provided a platform for the 
consideration of ambulatory colectomies where patients are discharged within 24 
hours after surgery. Although some studies have demonstrated its feasibility, 
the safety profile and patient eligibility criteria for discharge within 24 
hours after surgery remain relatively ill-defined. This study provided a review 
of the patient selection criteria and postoperative outcomes shown in patients 
discharged within 24 hours after surgery.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines were adhered to. A comprehensive search 
was performed on 3 electronic databases, and the relevant articles were 
identified. The primary outcome measures were postoperative morbidity and 
readmission rates. The different domains relevant to the selection of patients 
and perioperative care of patients discharged within 24 hours after surgery were 
also qualitatively assessed.
RESULTS: Eight studies were included, which involved a total of 1,229 patients. 
The majority of selected patients underwent elective laparoscopic colonic 
surgeries. The patient characteristics, such as age, comorbidities, obesity, and 
psychosocial environment, were important considerations. A close follow-up with 
home-based medical services was ideal in patients discharged within 24 hours 
after surgery. The readmission rates ranged from 0.0% to 9.0%. Despite morbidity 
rates of up to 26.7%, the majority of them were minor and classified as 
Clavien-Dindo Grade I to II.
CONCLUSION: The use of programs related to discharge within 24 hours after 
surgery in colorectal surgery is safe, feasible, and practical in a select group 
of patients within a well-designed clinical framework and pathway. Future 
studies should compare patient outcomes following discharge within 24 hours 
after surgery with conventional enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. In 
addition, patient and caregiver perceptions, quality of life, and 
cost-effectiveness analysis should also be performed.

Arthropods can host well-developed microbial communities, and such microbes can 
degrade pesticides and confer tolerance to most types of pests. Two cultures of 
the stored-product mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae, one with a symbiotic 
microbiome containing Wolbachia and the other without Wolbachia, were compared 
on pesticide residue (organophosphate: pirimiphos-methyl and pyrethroid: 
deltamethrin, deltamethrin + piperonyl butoxide)-containing diets. The 
microbiomes from mite bodies, mite feces and debris from the spent mite diet 
were analyzed using barcode sequencing. Pesticide tolerance was different among 
mite cultures and organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides. The pesticide 
residues influenced the microbiome composition in both cultures but without any 
remarkable trend for mite cultures with and without Wolbachia. The most 
influenced bacterial taxa were Bartonella-like and Bacillus for both cultures 
and Wolbachia for the culture containing this symbiont. However, there was no 
direct evidence of any effect of Wolbachia on pesticide tolerance. The high 
pesticide concentration residues in diets reduced Wolbachia, Bartonella-like and 
Bacillus in mites of the symbiotic culture. This effect was low for 
Bartonella-like and Bacillus in the asymbiotic microbiome culture. The results 
showed that the microbiomes of mites are affected by pesticide residues in the 
diets, but the effect is not systemic. No actual detoxification effect by the 
microbiome was observed for the tested pesticides.

Osteoporosis does not only affect postmenopausal women, but also ageing men. The 
burden of disease is projected to increase with higher life expectancy both in 
females and males. Importantly, osteoporotic men remain more often undiagnosed 
and untreated compared to women. Sex steroid deficiency is associated with bone 
loss and increased fracture risk, and circulating sex steroid levels have been 
shown to be associated both with bone mineral density and fracture risk in 
elderly men. However, in contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, the 
contribution of relatively small decrease of circulating sex steroid 
concentrations in the ageing male to the development of osteoporosis and related 
fractures, is probably only minor. In this review we provide several clinical 
and preclinical arguments in favor of a 'bone threshold' for occurrence of 
hypogonadal osteoporosis, corresponding to a grade of sex steroid deficiency 
that in general will not occur in many elderly men. Testosterone replacement 
therapy has been shown to increase bone mineral density in men, however data in 
osteoporotic ageing males are scarce, and evidence on fracture risk reduction is 
lacking. We conclude that testosterone replacement therapy should not be used as 
a sole bone-specific treatment in osteoporotic elderly men.

PURPOSE: Type-2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of death 
and disability worldwide. This study examines temporal patterns of the global, 
regional, and national burden of T2DM in the last three decades.
DATA AND METHODS: The estimates of age, sex and location-wise incident cases, 
deaths, prevalent cases, and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) and risk 
factors for 21 regions and 204 countries are retrieved from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2019 study from 1990 to 2019. Socio-demographic index (SDI) is used as 
the indicator of the development status of countries, and quadratic regression 
is employed to examine the relationship between country-level age-standardized 
rates and SDI.
RESULTS: Globally, incident cases of T2DM more than doubled from 8.4 million[95% 
uncertainty interval, 7.8-9.1 million] in 1990 to 21.7 million[20.0-23.5 
million] in 2019, and deaths more than doubled from 606,407[573,069-637,508] to 
1.5 million[1.4-1.6 million] between 1990 and 2019. Global T2DM prevalence 
increased from 148.4 million[135.5-162.6 million] in 1990 to 437.9
