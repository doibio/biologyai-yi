Multiple myeloma (MM) is an aggressive incurable plasma cell malignancy with a 
median life expectancy of less than seven years. Antibody-based therapies have 
demonstrated substantial clinical benefit for patients with hematological 
malignancies, particular in B cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The lack of 
immunotherapies specifically targeting MM cells led us to develop a human-mouse 
chimeric antibody directed against the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which 
is almost exclusively expressed on plasma cells and multiple myeloma cells. The 
high affinity antibody blocks the binding of the native ligands APRIL and BAFF 
to BCMA. This finding is rationalized by the high resolution crystal structure 
of the Fab fragment in complex with the extracellular domain of BCMA. Most 
importantly, the antibody effectively depletes MM cells in vitro and in vivo and 
substantially prolongs tumor-free survival under therapeutic conditions in a 
xenograft mouse model. A BCMA-antibody-based therapy is therefore a promising 
option for the effective treatment of multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases.

PopPlanner: visually constructing demographic models for simulation.

Switzerland.

Currently there are a number of coalescent simulation programs that support a 
wide range of features, such as arbitrary demographic models, migration, and sub 
structure. Defining the model is done typically with either text files or 
command line switches. Although this has proven to be a powerful method of 
defining models of high complexity, it is often error prone and difficult to 
read without familiarity both with command lines and the program in question. A 
intuitive GUI based population structure program that can both read and write 
applicable command lines would dramatically simplify the construction, 
modification, and error checking of such models by a wider user base.
RESULTS: PopPlanner is a tool to both construct and inspect complicated 
demographic models visually with a GUI where the user's primary interaction is 
through mouse gestures. Because of their popularity, we focus on ms and by 
extension msms, command line coalescent simulation programs. Our program can be 
used to find errors with existing command lines, or to build original command 
lines. Furthermore, the graphical output supports a number of editing and output 
features including export of publication quality figures.

Can we convert between outcome measures of disability for chronic low back pain?

(1)*Leicester Clinical Trials Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, United 
Kingdom; and †Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, United 
Kingdom.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis.
OBJECTIVE: A range of patient-reported outcomes were used to measure disability 
due to low back pain. There is not a single back pain disability measurement 
commonly used in all randomized controlled trials. We report here our assessment 
as to whether different disability measures are sufficiently comparable to allow 
data pooling across trials.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We used individual patient data from a repository of 
data from back pain trials of therapist-delivered interventions.
METHODS: We used data from 11 trials (n=6089 patients) that had at least 2 of 
the following 7 measurements: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Chronic 
Pain Grade disability score, Physical Component Summary of the 12- or 36-Item 
Short Form Health Survey, Patient Specific Functional Scale, Pain Disability 
Index, Oswestry Disability Index, and Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire. 
Within each trial, the change score between baseline and short-term follow-up 
was computed for each outcome and this was used to calculate the correlation 
between the change scores and the Cohen's κ for the 3-level outcome of change 
score of less than, equal to, and more than zero. It was considered feasible to 
pool 2 measures if they were at least moderately correlated (correlation>0.5) 
and have at least moderately similar responsiveness (κ>0.4).
RESULTS: Although all pairs of measures were found to be positively correlated, 
most correlations were less than 0.5, with only 1 pair of outcomes in 1 trial 
having a correlation of more than 0.6. All κ statistics were less than 0.4 so 
that in no cases were the criteria for acceptability of pooling measures 
satisfied.
CONCLUSION: The lack of agreement between different outcome measures means that 
pooling of data on these different disability measurements in a meta-analysis is 
not recommended.

Drosophila ovipositor extension in mating behavior and egg deposition involves 
distinct sets of brain interneurons.

Oviposition is a female-specific behavior that directly affects fecundity, and 
therefore fitness. If a fertilized female encounters another male that she has 
evaluated to be of better quality than her previous mate, it would be beneficial 
for her to remate with this male rather than depositing her eggs. Females who 
decided not to remate exhibited rejection behavior toward a courting male and 
engaged in oviposition. Although recent studies of Drosophila melanogaster 
identified sensory neurons and putative second-order ascending interneurons that 
mediate uterine afferents affecting female reproductive behavior, little is 
known about the brain circuitry that selectively activates rejection versus 
oviposition behaviors. We identified the sexually dimorphic pC2l and 
female-specific pMN2 neurons, two distinct classes of doublesex (dsx)-expressing 
neurons that can initiate ovipositor extension associated with rejection and 
oviposition behavior, respectively. pC2l interneurons, which induce ovipositor 
extrusion for rejection in females, have homologues that control courtship 
behavior in males. Activation of these two classes of neurons appears to be 
mutually exclusive and each governs hierarchical control of the motor program in 
the VNC either for rejection or oviposition, contributing centrally to the 
switching on or off of the alternative motor programs.

Nutrition myths and healthy dietary advice in clinical practice.

Healthy dietary intake is important for the maintenance of general health and 
wellness, the prevention of chronic illness, the optimization of life 
expectancy, and the clinical management of virtually all disease states. Dietary 
myths (i.e., concepts about nutrition that are poorly supported or contradicted 
by scientific evidence) may stand in the way of healthy dietary intake. Dietary 
myths exist about micronutrients, macronutrients, non-nutrients, and food 
energy. Representative myths of each type include that patients need to focus on 
consuming enough calcium to ensure bone health, dietary fat leads to obesity and 
is detrimental to vascular health, all fiber (whether naturally occurring or 
artificially added) is beneficial, and food calories translate to pounds of body 
weight through a linear relationship and simple arithmetic. A common theme for 
dietary myths is a reductionist view of diet that emphasizes selected food 
constituents as opposed to whole foods. Healthy dietary advice takes a more 
holistic view; consistent evidence supports recommendations to limit the 
consumption of ultraprocessed foods and to eat whole or minimally processed 
foods, generally in a form that is as close to what occurs in nature as 
possible. Family physicians can help dispel myths for patients and give sound 
nutritional advice by focusing on actual foods and broader dietary patterns.

BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines for breast cancer chemoprevention and MRI 
screening involve estimates of remaining lifetime risk (RLR); in the United 
States, women with an RLR of 20% or higher meet "high-risk" criteria for MRI 
screening.
METHODS: We prospectively followed 1764 women without breast cancer to compare 
the RLRs and 10-year risks assigned by the risk models International Breast 
Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS) and Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease 
Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) and to compare both sets 
of model-assigned 10-year risks to subsequent incidence of breast cancer in the 
cohort. We used chi-square statistics to assess calibration and the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. All 
statistical tests are two-sided.
RESULTS: The models classified different proportions of women as high-risk (IBIS 
= 59.3% vs BOADICEA = 20.1%) using the RLR threshold of 20%. The difference was 
smaller (IBIS = 52.9% vs BOADICEA = 43.2%) using a 10-year risk threshold of 
3.34%. IBIS risks (mean = 4.9%) were better calibrated to observed breast cancer 
incidence (5.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.2% to 6.4%) than were those of 
BOADICEA (mean = 3.7%) overall and within quartiles of model risk (P = .20 by 
IBIS and P = .07 by BOADICEA). Both models gave similar discrimination, with 
AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.61 to 0.73) using IBIS and 0.68 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.74) 
using BOADICEA. Model sensitivities at thresholds for a 20% false-positive rate 
were also similar, with 41.8% using IBIS and 38.0% using BOADICEA.
CONCLUSION: RLR-based guidelines for high-risk women are limited by discordance 
between commonly used risk models. Guidelines based on short-term risks would be 
more useful, as models are generally developed and validated under a short fixed 
time horizon (≤10 years).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the 
pancreas occur mostly in older individuals. Individual life expectancy and risk 
of death from other factors must be carefully considered in analyzing the risks 
that IPMNs pose. We investigated whether there is a subset of patients with 
IPMNs and a high risk of dying from other causes who would not benefit from 
pancreatic surgery.
METHODS: We collected data from 725 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital 
who underwent resection or have been under observation for IPMNs from 1992 
through 2012. Comorbidities were classified according to the age-adjusted 
Charlson comorbidity index (CACI). Causes of death were recorded, and survival 
data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The patients' median CACI score was 3; 10% of patients had CACI of 7 or 
more. Of the entire cohort, 55% underwent resection, and the remaining 45% have 
been under observation. After a median follow-up period of 5 years, 177 patients 
died (24%, 55% of deaths within 5 years of diagnosis); 78% of deaths were not 
related to IPMNs. The median survival time for all patients with CACI score of 7 
or more was 43 months. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the chance 
of non-IPMN-related death within 3 years of diagnosis is 11-fold higher for 
patients with CACI score of 7 or more than for patients with lower scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The CACI can be used to identify patients with a high risk of death 
from factors other than IPMNs within a few years after diagnosis. These patients 
are therefore not likely to benefit from further IPMN observation or pancreatic 
resection.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The literature has shown that different baseline 
adjustment approaches lead to different results when examining cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years. To our knowledge, the concept of baseline 
adjustment in a net benefit (NB) regression has not been studied. The purpose of 
the study was to explore the impact of different baseline adjustment approaches 
in an NB framework on the cost effectiveness of an intervention using 
person-level data.
METHODS: This study used data from a randomized controlled trial that evaluated 
the effectiveness of a multifactorial falls prevention intervention for older 
home care clients. The outcome was the number of falls at the 6-month follow-up. 
The cost variable was the total healthcare costs from a societal perspective. 
Incremental NB values were estimated using four baseline adjustment approaches: 
(1) the change in NB is the dependent variable; (2) the NB at follow-up is the 
dependent variable without adjusting for baseline values; (3) the NB at 
follow-up is the dependent variable adjusting for baseline NB; and (4) the NB at 
follow-up is also the dependent variable adjusting for baseline cost and effect 
separately.
RESULTS: With adjustment of baseline values (Approach 1, 3, 4), the intervention 
was not cost effective when compared to usual care. Conversely, without baseline 
adjustment (Approach 2), the intervention was cost effective if decision-makers' 
willingness-to-pay per fall prevented was CAN$10,000 or greater.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that different baseline adjustment approaches in 
a cost-effectiveness analysis can lead to different results. Future research is 
needed to determine the most appropriate adjustment approach in planning 
economic evaluation using NB regression.

Housing interventions for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission 
reduction have the potential to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution if they 
are implemented correctly. This work assessed the health impacts of home energy 
efficiency measures in England and Wales resulting in a reduction in average 
indoor PM2.5 exposures of 3 μg m(-3). The assessment was performed using a new 
multistate life table model which allows transition into and between multiple 
morbid states, including recovery to disease-free status and relapse, with 
transition rates informed by age- and cause-specific disease prevalence, 
incidence and mortality data. Such models have not previously included disease 
recovery. The results demonstrate that incorporation of recovery in the model is 
necessary for conditions such as asthma which have high incidence in early life 
but likelihood of recovery in adulthood. The impact assessment of the home 
energy efficiency intervention showed that the reduction in PM2.5 exposure would 
be associated with substantial benefits for mortality and morbidity from asthma, 
coronary heart disease and lung cancer. The overall impact would be an increase 
in life expectancy of two to three months and approximately 13 million QALYs 
gained over the 90 year follow-up period. Substantial quality-of-life benefits 
were also observed, with a decrease in asthma over all age groups and larger 
benefits due to reduced coronary heart disease and lung cancer, particularly in 
older age groups. The multistate model with recovery provides important 
additional information for assessing the impact on health of environmental 
policies and interventions compared with mortality-only life tables, allowing 
more realistic representation of diseases with substantial non-mortality 
burdens.

BACKGROUND: Reductions in prices following the expiry of patents on 
second-generation antipsychotics means that they could be made available to 
patients with schizophrenia in low-income countries. In this study we examine 
the cost effectiveness of antipsychotics for schizophrenia in Uganda.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic 10-state Markov model to represent the 
clinical and treatment course of schizophrenia and the experience of the average 
patient within the Uganda healthcare system. The model was run for a base 
population of 25-years-old patients attending Butabika National Referral Mental 
Hospital, in annual cycles over a lifetime horizon. Parameters were derived from 
a primary chart abstraction study, a local community pharmacy survey, published 
literature, and expert opinion where necessary. We computed mean 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs (in US$ 2012) for each 
antipsychotic, incremental cost, and DALYs averted as well as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, mean DALYs were highest with chlorpromazine 
(27.608), followed by haloperidol (27.563), while olanzapine (27.552) and 
risperidone had the lowest DALYs (27.557). Expected costs were highest with 
quetiapine (US$4943), and lowest with risperidone (US$4424). Compared to 
chlorpromazine, haloperidol was a dominant option (i.e. it was less costly and 
more effective); and risperidone was dominant over both haloperidol and 
quetiapine. The ICER comparing olanzapine to risperidone was US$5868 per DALY 
averted.
CONCLUSION: When choosing between first-generation antipsychotics, clinicians 
should consider haloperidol as the first-line agent for schizophrenia. However, 
overall, risperidone is a cost-saving strategy; policymakers should consider its 
addition to essential medicines lists for treatment of schizophrenia in Uganda.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for the burden of disease 
globally. This burden is estimated using Relative Risk (RR) functions for 
alcohol from meta-analyses that use data from all countries; however, for Russia 
and surrounding countries, country-specific risk data may need to be used. The 
objective of this paper is to compare the estimated burden of alcohol 
consumption calculated using Russia-specific alcohol RRs with the estimated 
burden of alcohol consumption calculated using alcohol RRs from meta-analyses.
METHODS: Data for 2012 on drinking indicators were calculated based on the 
Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. Data for 2012 on mortality, 
Years of Life Lost, Years Lived with Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) lost by cause were obtained by country from the World Health 
Organization. Alcohol Population-Attributable Fractions (PAFs) were calculated 
based on a risk modelling methodology from Russia. These PAFs were compared to 
PAFs calculated using methods applied for all other countries. The 95% 
Uncertainty Intervals (UIs) for the alcohol PAFs were calculated using a Monte 
Carlo-like method.
RESULTS: Using Russia-specific alcohol RR functions, in Russia in 2012 alcohol 
caused an estimated 231,900 deaths (95% UI: 185,600 to 278,200) (70,800 deaths 
among women and 161,100 deaths among men) and 13,295,000 DALYs lost (95% UI: 
11,242,000 to 15,348,000) (3,670,000 DALYs lost among women and 9,625,000 DALYs 
lost among men) among people 0 to 64 years of age. This compares to an estimated 
165,600 deaths (95% UI: 97,200 to 228,100) (29,700 deaths among women and 
135,900 deaths among men) and 10,623,000 DALYs lost (95% UI: 7,265,000 to 
13,754,000) (1,783,000 DALYs lost among women and 8,840,000 DALYs lost among 
men) among people 0 to 64 years of age caused by alcohol when 
non-Russia-specific alcohol RRs were used.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that if the Russia-specific RRs are used when 
estimating the health burden attributable to alcohol consumption in Russia, then 
the total estimated burden will be more than if RRs from meta-analyses are used. 
Furthermore, additional research is needed to understand which aspects of the 
Russian style of drinking cause the most harm.

Very high cycle fatigue behavior of SAE52100 bearing steel by ultrasonic 
nanocrystalline surface modification.

Cho IS, He Y, Li K, Oh JY, Shin K, Lee CS, Park IG.

In this paper, the SAE52100 bearing steel contained large quantities of 
cementite dispersed in ferrite matrix was subjected to the ultrasonic 
nanocrystalline surface modification (UNSM) treatment that aims for the 
extension of fatigue life. The microstructure and fatigue life of the untreated 
and treated specimens were studied by using electron backscattered diffraction 
(EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and a developed ultra-high 
cycle fatigue test (UFT). After UNSM treatment, the coarse ferrite grains (- 10 
μm) were refined to nanosize (- 200 nm), therefore, nanostructured surface 
layers were fabricated. Meanwhile, in the deformed layer, the number density and 
area fraction of cementite were increased up to - 400% and - 550%, respectively, 
which increased with the decrease in depth from the topmost treated surface. The 
improvement of hardness (from 200 Hv to 280 Hv) and high cycles fatigue strength 
by - 10% were considered the contribution of the developed nanostructure in the 
UNSM treated specimen.

INTRODUCTION: The Oncology field is characterised by a steady increase in demand 
and a consistent launching of innovative and expensive products. Therefore, 
cost-effectiveness analysis can contribute as a significant decision-making tool 
by elucidating the most economically efficient ways to satisfy compelling health 
needs.
AREAS COVERED: The scope of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
axitinib versus sorafenib, for the second-line treatment of renal cell 
carcinoma. A literature review for evidence synthesis was performed and a 
probabilistic Markov Model was employed to simulate disease progression. This 
study will also assess Value of Information.
EXPERT OPINION: Compared to sorafenib, axitinib resulted in an incremental cost 
of 87,936 euro per quality adjusted life year. The probability of axitinib to 
being cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 60,000 euro was 13%, 
while the corresponding probability of being cost-effective at the highest 
recommended willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000 euro was 69.9%. Uncertainty 
was primarily attributed to the price of the product, the utility values, the 
progression-free survival and to a lesser degree to the overall survival. 
Axitinib can be considered as a cost-effective therapeutic option for 
second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: Acquiring a diagnosis of schizophrenia reduces life expectancy for 
many reasons including poverty, difficulties in communication, side-effects of 
medication and access to care. This mortality gap is driven by natural deaths; 
cardiovascular disease is a major cause, but outcomes for people with severe 
mental illness are worse for many physical health conditions, including cancer, 
fractures and complications of surgery. We set out to examine the literature on 
disparities in medical and dental care experienced by people with schizophrenia 
and suggest possible approaches to improving health.
METHOD: This narrative review used a targeted literature search to identify the 
literature on physical health disparities in schizophrenia.
RESULTS: There is evidence of inequitable access to and/or uptake of physical 
and dental health care by those with schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: The goal was to reduce the mortality gap through equity of access to 
all levels of health care, including acute care, long-term condition management, 
preventative medicine and health promotion. We suggest solutions to promote 
health, wellbeing and longevity in this population, prioritising identification 
of and intervention for risk factors for premature morbidity and mortality. 
Shared approaches are vital, while joint education of clinicians will help break 
down the artificial mind-body divide.

Buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (BTI) is a low molecular weight polypeptide 
extracted from buckwheat. This study examined the effects of BTI on the lifespan 
of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and investigated the mechanism involved. 
Our results showed that recombinant BTI (rBTI) extended life expectancy by 
mimicking calorie restriction (CR) in C. elegans. rBTI promoted formation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) via increasing respiration, induced activities of 
ROS defense enzymes by activating DAF-16, and increased oxidative stress 
resistance and survival rates. The inhibition of ROS signal by antioxidants 
reduced rBTI-mediated longevity by up to 65%. Moreover, it was shown that the 
disruption of daf-2 abolished the extension of the lifespan and the increased 
ROS. Taken together, these data indicate that rBTI-mediated longevity mimics CR 
by down-regulating insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, implying that BTI has 
the potential to be a novel anti-aging drug.

OA58 Community capacity development for enhanced hospice palliative care: 
exploring the value of community engagement.

Whitfield K(1), LaBrie M(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Alberta, Faculty of Extension, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Over time, palliative care has become "professionalised", placing a 
burden on health care systems to manage the suffering of individuals and 
families with advancing, life-limiting illness. The need to develop resources, 
infrastructure and policy to enhance the capacity for communities to facilitate 
and support individuals and families can add value to communities, enrich 
hospice-palliative care and reduce health care system burden.
AIM: Few examples of communities developing such capacity exist, however, this 
oral presentation will describe the results of one study that examined, in one 
rural community in western Canada, key factors that influenced their ability to 
address their own hospice palliative care needs. We will report on factors that 
helped and factors that hindered them in their initial stages of planning for 
better care. A follow up study that is just at its initial stages (i.e. to start 
in Jan./Feb., 2015) will examine the value and outcomes of a model where 
communities collaborate with health care providers to strengthen their hospice 
palliative care community level capacities. In two rural communities in western 
Canada, such questions asked will be: What expertise and infrastructure is 
required to nurture community-based palliative care initiatives? What criteria 
constitute community engagement and leadership in hospice palliative care 
development? When using a model where communities collaborate with health care 
providers to strengthen their hospice palliative care, what are the direct 
outcomes? And are these of value, and if so, in what way, and if not why not?
METHODS: The two studies use multiple research methods. Both use a case study 
approach and framework. Results are also generated from a systematic literature 
review; semi-structured key informant interviews and focus group interviews.
RESULTS: Results from the first study reveal significant barriers to a community 
planning their hospice palliative care needs, such as: a lack of provincial 
guidelines or funds; unforeseen workload; community expectations for a hospice 
building versus improved care; and an overall fear of failure. Key factors 
supporting their planning were: improved community awareness; putting hospice 
palliative 'on the map' at a provincial level; substantial donations for new 
services etc. Although our second, follow study to determine more concrete 
outcomes to community leadership and collaboration with health care providers 
are unknown, we imagine results will speak to the need for specific and tangible 
resources, infrastructure and specific policy direction.

This paper presents a quantitative representation method for the upper-limb 
elbow joint angle using only electromyography (EMG) signals for continuous elbow 
joint voluntary flexion and extension in the sagittal plane. The dynamics 
relation between the musculotendon force exerted by the biceps brachii muscle 
and the elbow joint angle is developed for a modified musculoskeletal model. 
Based on the dynamics model, a quadratic-like quantitative relationship between 
EMG signals and the elbow joint angle is built using a Hill-type-based muscular 
model. Furthermore, a state switching model is designed to stabilize the 
transition of EMG signals between different muscle contraction motions during 
the whole movement. To evaluate the efficiency of the method, ten subjects 
performed continuous experiments during a 4-day period and five of them 
performed a subsequent consecutive stepping test. The results were calculated in 
real-time and used as control reference to drive an exoskeleton device 
bilaterally. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can 
provide suitable prediction results with root-mean-square (RMS) errors of below 
10° in continuous motion and RMS errors of below 10° in stepping motion with 20° 
and 30° increments. It is also easier to calibrate and implement.

The antihormonal preventive therapy of breast cancer and prostate cancer.

Senn HJ, Morant R, Otto F.

With the continuing increase of median life expectancy of important segments of 
the world's population, cancer incidence, as well as cancer related morbidity 
and mortality, are constantly increasing, especially for developing countries 
and for breast and prostate cancer, the predominant gender-associated cancer 
types. In addition to continuing, with more and more expensive efforts to 
develop new and more effective cancer treatments, it is health-politically and 
medico-professionally important to realise that only successful approaches to 
primary cancer prevention of major and frequent cancer types will be able to 
change this socially and economically unfavourably outlook. It is therefore 
encouraging to see that primary (or pharmacologic, interventional) cancer 
prevention programs have been successfully developed over the past decade for 
individuals at elevated risk for breast and prostate cancer on the basis of 
several scientifically well-conducted, prospective chemoprevention trials, 
mainly with synthetic anti-hormones (anti-estrogens and anti-androgens) in the 
USA, in Europe and Australia. This paper summarises the presently published 
results and design of several completed and some currently running primary 
cancer prevention trials in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and also points 
to the important obstacles for their conduct and translation into general 
practice in the broader populations at risk outside of clinical prevention 
research.

Longitudinal investigation of the neural correlates of reward processing in 
depression may represent an important step in defining effective biomarkers for 
antidepressant treatment outcome prediction, but the reliability of 
reward-related activation is not well understood. Thirty-seven healthy control 
participants were scanned using fMRI while performing a reward-related guessing 
task on two occasions, approximately one week apart. Two main contrasts were 
examined: right ventral striatum (VS) activation fMRI BOLD signal related to 
signed prediction errors (PE) and reward expectancy (RE). We also examined 
bilateral visual cortex activation coupled to outcome anticipation. Significant 
VS PE-related activity was observed at the first testing session, but at the 
second testing session, VS PE-related activation was significantly reduced. 
Conversely, significant VS RE-related activity was observed at time 2 but not 
time 1. Increases in VS RE-related activity from time 1 to time 2 were 
significantly associated with decreases in VS PE-related activity from time 1 to 
time 2 across participants. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) in VS were very low. 
By contrast, visual cortex activation had much larger ICCs, particularly in 
individuals with high quality data. Dynamic changes in brain activation are 
widely predicted, and failure to account for these changes could lead to 
inaccurate evaluations of the reliability of functional MRI signals. 
Conventional measures of reliability cannot distinguish between changes 
specified by algorithmic models of neural function and noisy signal. Here, we 
provide evidence for the former possibility: reward-related VS activations 
follow the pattern predicted by temporal difference models of reward learning 
but have low ICCs.
