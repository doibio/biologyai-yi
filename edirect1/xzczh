defined as the fluorescence signal of the tumour divided by the fluorescence 
signal of the surrounding healthy tissue. The dose-finding part of this study 
has been completed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT03384238.
FINDINGS: Between April, 2018, and July, 2019, 16 patients were screened for 
enrolment onto the study. Of the 16 screened patients, two (12%) patients 
withdrew from the study and three (19%) were not eligible; 11 (69%) patients 
completed the trial, all of whom were clinically diagnosed with pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma. The mean tumour-to-background ratio of primary tumours 
was 3·0 (SD 0·5) in the 25 mg group, 4·0 (SD 0·6) in the 50 mg group, and 3·7 
(SD 0·4) in the 75 mg group; the optimal dose was identified as 50 mg. 
Intraoperatively, near-infrared fluorescence imaging provided enhanced 
visualisation of the primary tumours, metastatic lymph nodes, and small (<2 mm) 
peritoneal metastasis. Intravenous administration of panitumumab-IRDye800CW at 
the doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg did not result in any grade 3 or higher 
adverse events. There were no serious adverse events attributed to 
panitumumab-IRDye800CW, although four possibly related adverse events (grade 1 
and 2) were reported in four patients.
INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this study presents the first clinical use of 
panitumumab-IRDye800CW for detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and shows 
that panitumumab-IRDye800CW is safe and feasible to use during pancreatic cancer 
surgery. Tumour-specific intraoperative imaging might have added value for 
treatment of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas through improved 
patient selection and enhanced visualisation of surgical margins, metastatic 
lymph nodes, and distant metastasis.

Alcohol use has been determined to be one of the main risk factors of, and 
contributors to, premature mortality in Russia, but no formal analysis of the 
impact of alcohol control policies has been undertaken so far. The present 
contribution is a commentary on a policy impact study undertaken by the World 
Health Organization on the effects of alcohol control measures on mortality and 
life expectancy in the Russian Federation. As part of the case study, all 
alcohol control policies in Russia from 1990 to 2018 were examined, and periods 
with differing policy intensity were distinguished based on the known 
effectiveness of different measures. Trends in all-cause mortality during these 
periods, and the shifts in trends between periods, were analysed using 
interrupted-time series methodology. As predicted, the intensity of alcohol 
control policies strongly impacted all-cause mortality. The experience of the 
Russian Federation in reducing the burden of disease caused by alcohol is a 
strong argument that effective alcohol policies are essential for improving the 
prospects for long and healthy lives.

A Systematic Review of Medication Adherence Interventions in Pediatric Sickle 
Cell Disease.

Comment in
    J Pediatr Psychol. 2020 Jul 1;45(6):607-609.

OBJECTIVE: Adherence to medication regimens is of critical importance in sickle 
cell disease (SCD). Most notably, data indicate that hydroxyurea, penicillin, 
and iron chelators increase life expectancy and decrease comorbid medical 
problems (e.g., strokes). However, average pediatric SCD adherence rates are 
only 55-74%. Studies have introduced interventions for pediatric SCD adherence, 
but no review has synthesized these data.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of interventions for enhancing 
medication adherence in pediatric SCD. There were 9 studies that met inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. The Pediatric Self-Management Model provided a framework 
for organizing the modifiable factors targeted by existing interventions.
RESULTS: The 9 studies had high risk of bias levels and most targeted 
hydroxyurea. All studies used multiple measures of adherence, the interventions 
were multicomponent, and most included behavioral or technological 
interventions. There was variability in terms of whether the intervention 
targeted the individual, family, community, or healthcare system.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the broader adherence literature, targeting 
knowledge alone was insufficient in increasing adherence. Findings suggest that 
reminders and targeting self-efficacy were key to success. In addition, 
addressing multiple domains in an intervention yielded larger effects on 
adherence. Although these results are promising, this review highlights several 
limitations of the extant literature, including a paucity of intervention 
studies and several methodological weaknesses, such as small sample sizes, few 
randomized controlled trials, and variable measures of adherence. 
Recommendations for advancing scientific understanding of adherence promoting 
interventions in pediatric SCD are provided.

Studies of morbidity compression routinely report the average number of years 
spent in an unhealthy state but do not report variation in age at morbidity 
onset. Variation was highlighted by Fries (1980) as crucial for identifying 
disease postponement. Using incidence of first hospitalization after age 60, as 
one working example, we estimate variation in morbidity onset over a 27-year 
period in Denmark. Annual estimates of first hospitalization and the population 
at risk for 1987 to 2014 were identified using population-based registers. 
Sex-specific life tables were constructed, and the average age, the threshold 
age, and the coefficient of variation in age at first hospitalization were 
calculated. On average, first admissions lasting two or more days shifted 
towards older ages between 1987 and 2014. The average age at hospitalization 
increased from 67.8 years (95% CI 67.7-67.9) to 69.5 years (95% CI 69.4-69.6) in 
men, and 69.1 (95% CI 69.1-69.2) to 70.5 years (95% CI 70.4-70.6) in women. 
Variation in age at first admission increased slightly as the coefficient of 
variation increased from 9.1 (95% CI 9.0-9.1) to 9.9% (95% CI 9.8-10.0) among 
men, and from 10.3% (95% CI 10.2-10.4) to 10.6% (95% CI 10.5-10.6) among women. 
Our results suggest populations are ageing with better health today than in the 
past, but experience increasing diversity in healthy ageing. Pensions, social 
care, and health services will have to adapt to increasingly heterogeneous 
ageing populations, a phenomenon that average measures of morbidity do not 
capture.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the past 5 years, adjuvant treatment options for 
surgically resected stage III melanoma have expanded with the introduction of 
several novel immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies. 
Pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, received US Food and 
Drug Administration approval in 2019 for resected high-risk stage III melanoma 
based on significantly longer recurrence-free survival versus placebo. This 
study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus other adjuvant 
treatment strategies for resected high-risk stage III melanoma from a US health 
system perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort-level model with four states (recurrence-free, 
locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, death) estimated costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pembrolizumab versus routine observation 
and other adjuvant comparators: ipilimumab in the overall population; and 
dabrafenib + trametinib in the BRAF-mutation positive (BRAF+) subgroup. 
Transition probabilities starting from recurrence-free were estimated through 
parametric multi-state modeling based on phase 3 KEYNOTE-054 (NCT02362594) trial 
data for pembrolizumab and observation, and network meta-analyses for other 
comparators. Post-recurrence transitions were modeled based on electronic 
medical records data and trials in advanced/metastatic melanoma. Utilities were 
derived using quality-of-life data from KEYNOTE-054 and literature. Costs of 
treatment, adverse events, disease management, and terminal care were included.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and observation were 
associated with QALYs of 9.24, 7.09, and 5.95 and total costs of $511,290, 
$992,721, and $461,422, respectively (2019 US dollars). Pembrolizumab was thus 
dominant (less costly, more effective) versus ipilimumab, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,155/QALY versus observation. In the BRAF+ 
subgroup, pembrolizumab dominated dabrafenib + trametinib and observation, 
decreasing costs by $62,776 and $11,250 and increasing QALYs by 0.93 and 3.10 
versus these comparators, respectively. Results were robust in deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: As adjuvant treatment for resected stage III melanoma, 
pembrolizumab was found to be dominant and therefore cost-effective compared 
with the active comparators ipilimumab and dabrafenib + trametinib. 
Pembrolizumab increased costs relative to observation in the overall population, 
with sufficient incremental benefit to be considered cost-effective based on 
typical willingness-to-pay thresholds.

As improvements in nutritional and pulmonary care increase the life expectancy 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) is emerging 
as a cause of mortality. CFLD is the third leading cause of death in CF 
patients. We performed a search on PubMed and Google Scholar for published 
articles on CFLD. We reviewed the articles found in the literature search and 
gave priority to recent publications and studies with larger sample sizes. The 
prevalence of CFLD in the CF population is around 23% with a range of 2-62% and 
that prevalence increases linearly with age from 3.7% at age 5 to 32.2% at age 
30. CFLD can present clinically in various ways such as hepatomegaly, variceal 
hemorrhage, persistent elevation of liver enzymes, and micro-gallbladder. Due to 
the focal nature of fibrosis in majority cases of CFLD, liver biopsies are 
sparsely performed for diagnosis or the marker of liver fibrosis. Although the 
mechanism of CFLD development is still unknown, many potential factors are 
reported. Some mutations of CFTR such as having a homozygous F508del mutation 
has been reported to increase the risk of developing CFLD and its severity. 
Having the SERPINA1 Z allele, a history of pancreatic insufficiency, a history 
meconium ileus, CF-related diabetes, or being male increases the risk of 
developing CFLD. Environmental factors do not appear to have significant effect 
on modulating CFLD development. Ursodeoxycholic acid is commonly used to treat 
or prevent CFLD, but the efficacy of this treatment is questionable.

Aim: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib in the 
treatment of patients with nonresected hepatocellular carcinoma in China. 
Materials & methods: Markov model was used to simulate the direct medical cost 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Clinical data were derived from the Phase 3 randomized clinical trial 
in a Chinese population. Results: Sorafenib treatment resulted in 1.794 QALYs at 
a cost of $43,780.73. Lenvatinib treatment resulted in 2.916 QALYs for patients 
weighing <60 and ≥60 kg at a cost of $57,049.43 and $75,900.36, The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio to the sorafenib treatment group was $11,825.94/QALY 
and $28,627.12/QALY, respectively. Conclusion: According to WHO's triple GDP per 
capita, the use of lenvatinib by providing drugs is a cost-effective strategy.

BACKGROUND: When psoriasis affects scalp, nails, palms and soles, it is 
considered difficult to treat and causes severe impairment of life quality.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated which difficult site most impacts on the patient's 
quality of life and how quality of life changes during treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study in patients receiving 
adalimumab over a 24 weeks period, through assessment at weeks 0, 4 and 24 using 
PASI, PAIN VAS, ITCH VAS, DLQI, NAPSI, PSSI. Pearson correlation was used to 
evaluate the relationship between the various measurements on the basis of three 
different deltas (between T0 and T24, between T0 and T4, between T0 and average 
between T4 and T24).
RESULTS: The correlation matrix between T0 and T24 shows a significant 
correlation between delta PASI and delta ITCH and delta ITCH and delta DLQI and 
a significant correlation between ITCH delta and DLQI delta and a correlation 
close to significance between DLQI and NAPSI.
CONCLUSION: We identified itching as a mediator between the cutaneous extension 
of psoriasis and the impact on quality of life. We also documented the 
predominant role of nail psoriasis in defining the impact on the quality of life 
of the psoriatic patient.

Introduction: The Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is a devastating complication 
of diabetes, with negative impact on both prognosis and quality of life. 
Moreover, the diagnostic is often missed or delayed. Case report: A 50 years old 
male patient with dyslipidemia, overweight and hypertension was referred to our 
Diabetes Department in the context of newly diagnosed diabetes (HbA1C=11.7%), 
four days after left hallux trans-metatarsal amputation and debridement of the 
dorsal collection, for wet gangrene of the left hallux, with dorsal extension. 
The diagnostic of diabetic neuro-osteoarthropathy of the left foot was delayed 
several months. A good glycemic control was achieved with insulin glargine and 
metformin. We look further to introducing modern antidiabetic drugs with not 
only proven cardiovascular benefit but also good impact on weight. The patient 
needs to be managed by a multidisciplinary team, which has to include a 
podiatrist and a vascular surgeon. Conclusions: This case suggest the importance 
of rising diabetes and diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy awareness in all 
medical fields.

The instability and strong flavor or odor of essential oils (EO) limit their 
direct incorporation into food products. In this study, the antioxidant and 
antimicrobial Heracleum lasiopetalum essential oil (HLEO) was added to Lepidium 
sativum seed mucilage (LSSM) solution at four concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, and 
1.5%) to develop a novel edible coating and expand its food application. 
HLEO-loaded LSSM coating was then used to improve the shelf life and quality of 
beef as a model food system. The coated and control beef samples were 
periodically analyzed for physicochemical analysis, microbiological, and sensory 
characteristics over a period of 9 days at 4 °C. The HLEO-enriched LSSM coating, 
particularly 1.5% loaded one resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 
oxidative and microbiological stability and overall acceptance of the beef 
samples, compared to the control counterpart. HLEO-loaded LSSM coating, 
therefore, provides a promising alternative to preserve the meat products under 
cold storage.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating, progressive disease with 
increasingly debilitating symptoms and usually shortened overall life 
expectancy. This article reviews the global epidemiology of PH with focus on 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and sub-Sahara African in particular. 
Although left ventricular heart disease is the most common cause globally, the 
main contributing risk factors in LMICs are chronic infectious diseases 
especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and schistosomiasis. Other 
important risk factors of PH are rheumatic heart disease, untreated congenital 
heart disease (CHD), and sickle cell disease. Despite existing epidemiological 
data of PH risk factors suggesting a high prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA), the available literature is limited. International registries in LMICs 
like the pan African pulmonary hypertension cohort (PAPUCO) study are essential 
to provide information about the causes, treatment, outcome, and the natural 
course of PH in Africa and other parts of the world. In addition, there is a 
need to track diagnostic and management practices in order to develop suitable 
algorithms to diagnose PH in LMICs.

With advances in medicine and healthcare systems, the average life expectancy of 
human beings has increased to more than 80 yrs. As a result, the demographic 
old-age dependency ratio (people aged 65 or above relative to those aged 15-64) 
is expected to increase, by 2060, from ∼28% to ∼50% in the European Union and 
from ∼33% to ∼45% in Asia (Ageing Report European Economy, 2015). Therefore, the 
percentage of people who need additional care is also expected to increase. For 
instance, per studies conducted by the National Program for Health Care of the 
Elderly (NPHCE), elderly population in India will increase to 12% of the 
national population by 2025 with 8%-10% requiring utmost care. Geriatric 
healthcare has gained a lot of prominence in recent years, with specific focus 
on fall detection systems (FDSs) because of their impact on public lives. 
According to a World Health Organization report, the frequency of falls 
increases with increase in age and frailty. Older people living in nursing homes 
fall more often than those living in the community and 40% of them experience 
recurrent falls (World Health Organization, 2007). Machine learning (ML) has 
found its application in geriatric healthcare systems, especially in FDSs. In 
this paper, we examine the requirements of a typical FDS. Then we present a 
survey of the recent work in the area of fall detection systems, with focus on 
the application of machine learning. We also analyze the challenges in FDS 
systems based on the literature survey.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rhinocerebral mycosis is a rapidly invasive infection in 
diabetic patients with an unfavorable course. Herein, we report a rare case of 
orbital cellulitis caused by Curvularia lunata following fungal rhinosinusitis 
in a diabetic male patient.
CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes presented to the 
emergency department of our center with high-grade fever accompanied by chills 
and rigors, severe diffuse headache, and projectile vomiting with swelling and 
loss of vision in the right eye. The tissue sample from surgical debridement 
showed pigmented hyphae; in addition, Curvularia lunata was isolated in culture. 
Imaging was indicative of orbital extension. Therefore, the patient was 
diagnosed with fungal rhinosinusitis with orbital cellulitis. The patient was 
subjected to extensive surgical debridement, along with antifungals. 
Rhinosinusitis resolved; however, the loss of vision was irreversible.
CONCLUSION: Orbital cellulitis is a very rare but life-threatening complication 
of fungal rhinosinusitis. Very few cases of orbital cellulitis following fungal 
rhinosinusitis have been reported in the literature. Early and prompt diagnosis 
can save the life of a patient.

BACKGROUND: Functional reconstruction after resection of pelvic malignancies 
involving the acetabulum remains challenging. Numerous reconstruction methods 
have been proposed, but they are generally associated with mechanical and 
nonmechanical complications. To improve the function of patients with primary 
malignancies of the acetabulum after internal hemipelvectomy and reduce the 
complication rate after this procedure, we designed a series of 
three-dimensionally (3D) printed, custom-made, integrative hemipelvic 
endoprostheses with a porous structure and wanted to present the early results 
of using this construct to determine whether it could be considered a reasonable 
reconstruction option.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We performed this study to (1) evaluate, in a small group of 
patients, whether the new endoprosthesis restores short-term lower-limb 
function; (2) identify short-term complications associated with the use of this 
endoprosthesis; and (3) assess osseointegration between the host bone and the 
3D-printed integrative hemipelvic endoprosthesis with a porous structure.
METHODS: Between October 2016 and May 2017, our center treated 26 patients with 
malignancies involving the acetabulum. Thirteen of these patients received 
hemipelvic replacement with a 3D-printed, custom-made, integrative 
endoprosthesis, six received hemipelvic replacement with a modular 
endoprosthesis, four received radiotherapy, and three received external 
hemipelvectomy. Resection and reconstruction with a 3D-printed, custom-made, 
integrative endoprosthesis were indicated if the resection margin was the same 
as that achieved in hemipelvectomy, if reconstruction would preserve reasonable 
function after resection, if the patient had a good physical status and life 
expectancy longer than 6 months, and if the patient was willing to accept the 
potential risk of a 3D-printed, custom-made, endoprosthesis. The exclusion 
criteria were an inability to achieve a satisfactory surgical margin with limb 
salvage, inability to preserve the function of the limb because of tumor 
involvement of the sacral nerve or sciatic nerve, and unresectable and/or widely 
metastatic disease on presentation. Pain and function were evaluated with the 
10-cm VAS score (range 0 to 10; a lower score is desirable), the 1993 version of 
the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS-93) score (range 0 to 30; a higher score 
is desirable), and the Harris hip score ([HHS]; range 0 to 100; a higher score 
is desirable) were evaluated preoperatively and at a median of 27 months after 
reconstruction (range 24 to 31 months). The functional scores and complications 
were recorded after reviewing the patients' records. Osseointegration was 
assessed with digital tomosynthesis by two senior surgeons. We observed the 
trabecular structures connected to the implant surface to assess whether there 
was good osseointegration.
RESULTS: The median preoperative VAS score, MSTS-93 score, and HHS were 5 (range 
2 to 8), 14 (range 3 to 18), and 64 (range 20 to 76) points, respectively. At 
the latest follow-up interval, the median VAS score, MSTS-93 score, and HHS were 
2 (range 0 to 6), 23 (range 15 to 27), and 82 (range 44 to 93) points, 
respectively. No deep infection, dislocation, endoprosthetic breakage, aseptic 
loosening, or local recurrence occurred. Two patients experienced delayed wound 
healing; the wounds healed after débridement. Using digital tomography, we found 
that all implants were well-osseointegrated at the final follow-up examination.
CONCLUSIONS: A 3D-printed, custom-made, integrative hemipelvic endoprosthesis 
provides acceptable early outcomes in patients undergoing pelvic reconstruction. 
Osseointegration is possible, and we anticipate this will lead to biologic 
stability with a longer follow-up interval. The custom-made integrative design 
ensured precise implantation. Although a few patients in this study had only a 
short follow-up duration, the functional results were reasonable. We have 
observed no major complications so far, but this was a very small series and we 
caution that these are large reconstructions that will certainly result in 
complications for some patients. Our method uses a precise preoperative 
simulation and endoprosthesis design to aid the surgeon in performing 
challenging operations. If our early results are confirmed with more patients 
and longer follow-up and are replicated at other centers, this may be a 
reconstruction option for patients with periacetabular malignancies.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

The assessment of the radiological impact of decommissioning activities at a 
nuclear power plant requires a detailed analysis of the distribution of 
radionuclides in the environment surrounding it. The present work concerns data 
of three campaigns carried out during the last twenty years in the plain of the 
Garigliano river surrounding the Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant (GNPP), which is 
located in Southern Italy and shut down in 1979. Moreover, some data from 
surveys held in the eighties, across the Chernobyl accident, have been taken in 
account. The results for the soil samples, in particular for 137Cs and 236U 
specific activity, were analyzed for their extension in space and in time. Some 
of the problems related to the classical analysis of environmental radiological 
data (non-normal distribution of the values, small number of sample points, 
multiple comparison and presence of values lesser than the minimum detectable 
activity) have been overcome with the use of Bayesian methods. The scope of the 
paper is threefold: (1) to introduce the data of the last campaign held in the 
Garigliano plain; (2) to insert these data in a larger spatio-temporal frame; 
(3) to show how the Bayesian approach can be applied to radiological 
environmental surveys, stressing out its advantages over other approaches, using 
the data of the campaigns. The results show that radionuclides specific activity 
in soil is dominated by the natural sources with the contribution of the 
atmospheric fallout. A detailed study was performed on the 137Cs data to 
evaluate both their statistical distribution and the trend over the space and 
the time. It results that (i) no new contribution there was in the last decades, 
(ii) specific activity values of the area surrounding the GNPP are consistent 
with those obtained in other farther areas, (iii) the effective depletion 
half-life factor for 137Cs is much lower than the half-life of the radionuclide.

AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of stent insertion alone to stent 
insertion combined with any active oncological treatment in the palliative care 
of esophageal cancer.
METHODS: A meta-analysis and systematic review were performed according to the 
PRISMA Statement. Comparative studies with patients receiving stent insertion 
alone (control group) were compared to patients receiving oncological therapy in 
addition to stent placement (intervention group). For mean dysphagia grade 
before stenting, weighted mean differences (WMD), for the complications of 
stenting, risk ratios (RR) were calculated, both were interpreted with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Whenever possible, subgroup analyses were performed 
for studies with irradiation stents as intervention. Survival, late dysphagia, 
esophageal perforation and medical costs were analyzed via systematic review. 
The protocol of the study was registered prior on PROSPERO.
RESULTS: 17 studies with 1177 esophageal cancer patients were included in the 
final analysis, with 629 and 548 in the control and intervention groups, 
respectively. We found no significant difference in any complications of 
stenting between the two groups. 13 studies reported mean or median survival, 
and 8 found that combined therapy resulted in a significantly longer life 
expectancy. In the other 5 studies, there was no difference in survival between 
the two groups. Furthermore, additional treatment may be more effective in the 
long-term relief of dysphagia than stenting alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation stents may prolong survival, and stenting combined with 
oncological treatment does not increase the risk of complications as compared to 
stenting alone. However, further studies are warranted.
CORE TIP: Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common type of malignancy 
worldwide, and its prognosis is very poor. This suggests that palliative 
treatment modalities are paramount in its treatment. Self-expanding metal stents 
play an important role in the management of dysphagia caused by the tumor. 
However, it is unclear whether any additional oncological therapy should be 
administered to patients besides stenting. In this meta-analysis and systematic 
review, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of additional oncological therapies 
alongside stenting versus stenting alone in case of unresectable esophageal 
cancer.

Background: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and chronic respiratory diseases 
(CRDs) are the main causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Methods: The 
main evidences about the NCDs and CRDs burden and related risk factors, from 
updated international reports and results of original researches, were collected 
and described in this review. Results: Most recent evidence is available from 
the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2017 reports. There were 3.2 million 
deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 495,000 deaths 
due to asthma. COPD was the seventh leading cause of years of life lost (YLLs). 
Overall, prevalent cases of CRDs were 545 million: about 50% for COPD and 50% 
for asthma. Incident cases of CRDs were 62 million, mostly due to asthma (69%) 
and COPD (29%). COPD accounted for 81.6 million disability-adjusted life years, 
asthma for 22.8 million. COPD prevalence of 9.1% has been found in a recent 
general population sample of North-Eastern Italy, while in Central Italy a 
25-year follow-up of a general population sample has shown an increased 
prevalence of COPD and asthma up to 6.8% and 7.8%, respectively. In Central 
Italy, a COPD incidence of 8% and an asthma incidence of 3.2% have been found in 
adult subjects at an 18-year follow-up. Among the risk factors, a relevant role 
is played by smoking and high body mass index for asthma, while smoking, 
particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, occupational exposure to 
particulate matter, gases and fumes, as well as second-hand smoke, play an 
important role for COPD. Forecasting the YLLs by 2040 indicates a rising toll 
from several NCDs due to population growth and aging, with COPD expected to 
reach the fourth leading cause. Conclusions: Several recent studies and 
international reports highlighted the huge global health burden of CRDs and 
other major NCDs, pointing out the need for implementing international 
collaborations to fight this epidemic trend.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness from a Canadian perspective of 
index patient germline BRCA testing and then, if positive, family members with 
subsequent risk-reducing surgery (RRS) in as yet unaffected mutation carriers 
compared with no testing and treatment of cancer when it develops.
METHODS: A patient level simulation was developed comparing outcomes between two 
groups using Canadian data. Group 1: no mutation testing with treatment if 
cancer developed. Group 2: cascade testing (index patient BRCA tested and 
first-/second-degree relatives tested if index patient/first-degree relative is 
positive) with RRS in carriers. End points were the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact.
RESULTS: There were 29,102 index patients: 2,786 ovarian cancer and 26,316 
breast cancer (BC). Using the base-case assumption of 44 percent and 21 percent 
of women with a BRCA mutation receiving risk-reducing bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy and risk-reducing mastectomy, respectively, testing was 
cost effective versus no testing and treatment on cancer development, with an 
ICER of CAD 14,942 (USD 10,555) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 127 and 
104 fewer cases of ovarian and BC, respectively, and twenty-one fewer all-cause 
deaths. Testing remained cost effective versus no testing at the commonly 
accepted North American threshold of approximately CAD 100,000 (or USD 100,000) 
per QALY gained in all scenario analyses, and cost effectiveness improved as RRS 
uptake rates increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention via testing and RRS is cost effective at current RRS 
uptake rates; however, optimization of uptake rates and RRS will increase cost 
effectiveness and can provide cost savings.

Histone ubiquitination plays an important role in the DNA damage response (DDR) 
pathway. RNF168 catalyzes H2A and H2AX ubiquitination on lysine 13/15 (K13/K15) 
upon DNA damage and promotes the accrual of downstream repair factors at damaged 
chromatin. Here, we report that RNF168 ubiquitinates the non-canonical H2A 
variants H2AZ and macroH2A1/2 at the divergent N-terminal tail lysine residue. 
In addition to their evolutionarily conserved nucleosome acidic patch, we 
identify the positively charged alpha1-extension helix as essential for 
RNF168-mediated ubiquitination of H2A variants. Moreover, mutation of the RNF168 
UMI (UIM- and MIU-related UBD) hydrophilic acidic residues abolishes 
RNF168-mediated ubiquitination as well as 53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing 
radiation-induced foci formation. Our results reveal a juxtaposed bipartite 
electrostatic interaction utilized by the nucleosome to direct RNF168 
orientation towards the target lysine residues in proximity to the H2A 
alpha1-extension helix, which plays an important role in the DDR pathway.

BACKGROUND: Rhinoplasty is one of the most popular procedures in facial plastic 
surgery. It is a technically demanding surgery with a long learning curve. The 
outcome may be very beneficial to the function of the nasal breathing as well as 
the patient's social life but harbors many pitfalls and sequelae from minor to 
devastating. This grants a high demand on the knowledge of the nose's anatomy 
and the implication of each conducted maneuver or grafting during the surgery 
both short and long term.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the presented case report, we demonstrate the sequelae 
of a secondary rhinoplasty case, analyze the outcomes, present the revision 
surgery in detail, and show the follow-ups. Most negative outcomes of primary 
rhinoplasty may be led back to the particular techniques applied. Leading causes 
of revision surgery include loss of tip projection, inverted-V-deformity, axis 
deviation, dorsal irregularities, internal and external nasal valve collapse, 
damage to the soft tissue envelope, and many more.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that through such an illustrative case discussion, we 
may enhance the skills and critical appraisal of young surgeons in 
decision-making.
