OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of a novel screening strategy using a 
microRNA (miRNA) blood test as a screen, followed by endoscopy for diagnosis 
confirmation in a 3-yearly population screening program for gastric cancer.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model has been developed in Microsoft Excel 2016 for 
the population identified to be at intermediate risk (Singaporean men, aged 
50-75 years with Chinese ethnicity). The interventions compared were (1) initial 
screening using miRNA test followed by endoscopy for test-positive individuals 
and a 3-yearly follow-up screening for test-negative individuals (proposed 
strategy), and (2) no screening with gastric cancer being diagnosed clinically 
(current practice). The model was evaluated for 25 years with a healthcare 
perspective and accounted for test characteristics, compliance, disease 
progression, cancer recurrence, costs, utilities, and mortality. The outcomes 
measured included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cancer stage at 
diagnosis, and thresholds for significant variables.
RESULTS: The miRNA-based screening was found to be cost-effective with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 971/quality-adjusted life-year. Key 
drivers included test costs, test accuracy, cancer incidence, and recurrence 
risk. Threshold analysis highlights the need for high accuracy of miRNA tests 
(threshold sensitivity: 68%; threshold specificity: 77%). A perfect compliance 
to screening would double the cancer diagnosis in early stages compared to the 
current practice. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported the miRNA-based 
screening to be cost-effective in >95% of iterations for a willingness to pay of 
$70 000/quality-adjusted life-year (approximately equivalent to 1 gross domestic 
product/capita) CONCLUSIONS: The miRNA-based screening intervention was found to 
be cost-effective and is expected to contribute immensely in early diagnosis of 
cancer by improving screening compliance.

OBJECTIVE: Very few cost-utility analyses have either evaluated direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 patients or undertaken 
societal perspective. Recently, DAAs have been introduced into the Vietnamese 
health insurance drug list for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment without 
empirical cost-effectiveness evidence. This study was conducted to generate 
these data on DAAs among CHC patients with genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam.
METHODS: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov model was employed to compare costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of available DAAs, including (1) 
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, (2) sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and (3) sofosbuvir plus 
daclatasvir, with pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (PR). Primary data 
collection was conducted in Vietnam to identify costs and utility values. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated from societal and payer 
perspectives. Uncertainty and scenario analyses and value of information 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: All DAAs were cost-saving as compared with PR in CHC patients with 
genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was the most 
cost-saving regimen, from both societal and payer perspectives. From the 
societal perspective, DAAs were associated with the increment of 
quality-adjusted life-years by 1.33 to 1.35 and decrement of costs by $6519 to 
$7246. Uncertainty and scenario analyses confirmed the robustness of base-case 
results, whereas the value of information analyses suggested the need for 
further research on relative treatment efficacies among DAA regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Allocating resources for DAA treatment for HCV genotype 1 and 6 is 
surely a rewarding public health investment in Vietnam. It is recommended that 
the government rapidly scale up treatment and enable financial accessibility for 
HCV patients.

OBJECTIVES: Patient preferences are increasingly important in informing clinical 
and policy decisions. Health-state utility values (HSUVs) are quantitative 
measures of people's preferences over different health states. In schizophrenia, 
there is no clarity about HSUVs across the symptoms' severity spectrum. This 
meta-analysis aims to synthesize the literature on HSUVs in people with 
schizophrenia.
METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, EconLit, The Cochrane Library, 
and specialized databases. The studies reporting HSUVs in people with 
schizophrenia were selected and pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. The 
primary outcome was the mean HSUV obtained from participants.
RESULTS: A total of 54 studies involving 87 335 participants were included. The 
pooled estimate using direct elicitation was a mean HSUV of 0.79 (95% CI: 
0.70-0.88) for mild symptomatic states, 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54-0.85) in moderate 
states, and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.13-0.56) in severe states. Studies using indirect 
techniques resulted in a pooled mean HSUV of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.78) applying 
the EuroQol 5-dimension, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62-0.71) in the Short-Form 6-dimension, 
and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.57-0.61) using the Quality of Well-Being scale. All the 
estimates resulted in considerable heterogeneity, partially reduced by 
meta-regression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the severity of psychotic symptoms has an 
important effect on HSUVs in schizophrenia, with values mirroring patients with 
disabling physical conditions such as cancer and stroke. Decision makers should 
be aware of these results when including people's preferences in trials, models, 
and policy decisions.

With a growing ageing population and increased life expectancy in the UK, oral 
healthcare professionals will be exposed to a greater number of patients with 
health conditions which may affect cognitive function, communication and 
capacity to consent to treatment. This often gives rise to a conundrum which 
clinicians may face when considering capacity, consent and the legal 
implications and frameworks surrounding this. Assessing patient capacity is 
encountered routinely in dental practice and so oral healthcare professionals 
should be well informed of their responsibilities in this context. This article 
summarises and introduces readers to key concepts regarding consent and capacity 
with reference to relevant cross-jurisdictional legislation.

BACKGROUND: Apps for real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on 
smartphones and other devices linked to CGM systems have recently been 
developed, and such CGM apps are also coming into use in Japan. In comparison 
with conventional retrospective CGM, the use of CGM apps improves patients' own 
blood glucose control, which is expected to help slow the progression of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (DM) and prevent complications, but the effect of their 
introduction on medical costs remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study was to perform an economic appraisal of 
CGM apps from the viewpoint of assessing public medical costs associated with 
type 2 DM, using the probability of developing type 2 DM-associated 
complications, and data on medical costs and utility value to carry out a 
medical cost simulation using a Markov model in order to ascertain the 
cost-effectiveness of the apps.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with the transition states of insulin 
therapy, nephrosis, dialysis, and cardiovascular disease, all of which have a 
major effect on medical costs, to identify changes in medical costs and utility 
values resulting from the introduction of a CGM app and calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The ICER for CGM app use was US $33,039/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity analyses showed that, with the exception of conditions 
where the transition probability of insulin therapy, utility value, or increased 
medical costs increases, the ICER for the introduction of CGM apps was below the 
threshold of US $43,478/QALY used by the Central Social Insurance Medical 
Council. Our results provide basic data on the cost-effectiveness of introducing 
CGM apps, which are currently starting to come into use.

BACKGROUND: N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol; Esperoct® , Novo Nordisk A/S, 
Bagsvaerd, Denmark) is a glycoPEGylated, extended half-life human recombinant 
factor VIII (FVIII).
OBJECTIVE: Here, we report end-of-trial safety and efficacy results from the 
completed N8-GP pathfinder5 trial.
METHODS: pathfinder5 (NCT01731600) was a multi-national, open-label, single-arm, 
non-randomized, non-controlled trial in previously treated male patients aged 
<12 years old with severe hemophilia A that comprised a main and an extension 
phase. During the main phase, patients received twice-weekly N8-GP 60 IU/kg for 
50 exposure days (~26 weeks). During the extension phase, patients received the 
same regimen until the end of trial (first patient in main phase, 20 February 
2013; trial end, 28 September 2018).
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were exposed to N8-GP for a median time of 
~4.9 years on regimen. Of the 63 patients who started in the extension phase, 62 
completed the trial. No FVIII inhibitors (≥0.6 BU) or other safety concerns were 
detected. The overall estimated annualized bleeding rate was 1.08 (median 0.81), 
and nearly 20% of patients had no bleeds during the entire trial. The proportion 
of patients with no annual bleeds increased with time, with 56% of patients 
experiencing no bleeds and 86% experiencing no spontaneous bleeds during the 
fourth year of exposure. All baseline target joints of patients who participated 
in both phases of this trial were resolved in slightly over 2 years.
CONCLUSION: Overall, data from the completed pathfinder5 trial show that 
long-term (median 4.9 years) N8-GP treatment was efficacious and well tolerated 
in previously treated pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A.

Osteoporosis is a common condition in older people. This condition leads to 
increased risk of fractures and is associated with morbidity and mortality. The 
number of patients with osteoporosis will increase significantly in the years to 
come due to the increasing numbers of older people and increasing life 
expectancy. This will be accompanied by increasing demand for care and clinical 
practice will be faced with questions about therapeutic options and the optimal 
treatment duration for patients with osteoporosis or increased risk of 
fractures. In this educational article, we are using practical questions to 
provide an overview of pathophysiology, diagnostics and treatment of 
osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures.

Current management of the vascular subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Benrashid E(1), Ohman JW.

Author information:
(1)Section of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, 
Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is the most severe 
form of EDS, affecting the synthesis of type III collagen. It is notable for 
decreased life expectancy and morbidity, including spontaneous vessel rupture. 
The present review summarizes recent findings that have improved the ability to 
manage and delineate the natural history of vEDS.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent EDS consortium guidelines for the diagnosis of vEDS have 
emerged and outlined clinical features and molecular diagnostic tools to help 
facilitate rapid diagnosis. Although medical interventions to help halt the 
disease progression remain limited, improved awareness of vEDS by patients and 
practitioners have resulted in increased average life expectancy. Early 
excitement with celiprolol has been tempered by a lack of high-quality studies. 
Likewise, the creation of multidisciplinary care teams and tertiary referral 
centers is helping improve outcomes. Unfortunately, there remain limitations in 
terms of the surgical management (including more advanced endovascular 
techniques) of these patients and the morbidity associated with these 
interventions.
SUMMARY: Although new consensus guidelines have emerged to facilitate the 
diagnosis of those with vEDS, there remain limitations in terms of interventions 
and medical therapy that can be provided for these patients. Life expectancy 
does appear to be improving however with increased awareness and coordinated 
multidisciplinary efforts among medical geneticists, general practitioners, and 
interventionalists alike.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the economic case for nationwide scale-up of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist using cost-effectiveness and 
benefit-cost analyses.
BACKGROUND: The Checklist improves surgical outcomes but the economic case for 
widespread use remains uncertain. For perioperative quality improvement 
interventions to compete successfully against other worthwhile health and 
nonhealth interventions for limited government resources they must demonstrate 
cost-effectiveness and positive societal benefit.
METHODS: Using data from 3 countries, we estimated the benefits as the total 
years of life lost (YLL) due to postoperative mortality averted over a 3 year 
period; converted the benefits to dollar equivalent values using estimates of 
the economic value of an additional year of life expectancy; estimated total 
implementation costs; and determined incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
and benefit-cost ratio (BCR). Costs are reported in international dollars using 
Word Bank purchasing power parity conversion factors at 2016 price-levels.
RESULTS: In Benin, Cameroon, and Madagascar ICERs were: $31, $138, and $118 per 
additional YLL averted; and BCRs were 62, 29, and 9, respectively. Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that the associated mortality reduction and increased 
usage due to Checklist scale-up would need to deviate approximately 10-fold from 
published data to change our main interpretations.
CONCLUSIONS: According to WHO criteria, Checklist scale-up is considered "very 
cost-effective" and for every $ 1 spent the potential return on investment is $9 
to $62. These results compare favorably with other health and nonhealth 
interventions and support the economic argument for investing in Checklist 
scale-up as part of a national strategy for improving surgical outcomes.

Cost-effectiveness of Surgical Treatment Pathways for Prolapse.

Wang R, Hacker MR, Richardson M.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment pathways for 
apical prolapse.
STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a stochastic Markov model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of vaginal apical suspension, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, 
and robotic sacrocolpopexy. We modeled over 5 and 10 years, with 9 pathways 
accounting for up to 2 separate surgical repairs, recurrence of symptomatic 
apical prolapse, reoperation, and complications, including mesh excision. We 
calculated costs from the health care system's perspective.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, compared with expectant management, all surgical 
treatment pathways cost less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50,000 
per quality adjusted life-years. However, among surgical treatments, all but 2 
pathways were dominated. Of the remaining 2, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy 
followed by vaginal repair for apical recurrence was not cost-effective compared 
with the vaginal-only approach (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], 
>$500,000). Over 10 years, all but the same 2 pathways were dominated. However, 
starting with the laparoscopic approach in this case was more cost-effective 
with an ICER of US $6,176. If the laparoscopic approach was not available, 
starting with the robotic approach similarly became more cost-effective at 10 
years (ICER, US $35,479).
CONCLUSIONS: All minimally invasive surgical approaches for apical prolapse 
repair are cost-effective when compared with expectant management. Among 
surgical treatments, the vaginal-only approach is the only cost-effective option 
over 5 years. However, over a longer period, starting with a laparoscopic (or 
robotic) approach becomes cost-effective. These results help inform discussions 
regarding the surgical approach for prolapse.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With improving life expectancy and quality of life, sexual 
and reproductive health (SRH) has become an increasingly important aspect of 
patient-centered cystic fibrosis care. This review aims to describe advances in 
cystic fibrosis-related SRH and highlight optimal practices.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications suggest that people with cystic fibrosis 
follow a similar trajectory of sexual development and activity as their 
noncystic fibrosis peers, although contraception use is lower. Although 
fertility is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis, improved survival and 
assisted reproductive technologies have led to an increasing pursuit and 
incidence of pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulators that 
correct the underlying cystic fibrosis defect might improve fertility and thus 
far appear safe in pregnancy, though data are limited.Despite medical knowledge 
of SRH in cystic fibrosis, patients continue to report they lack sufficient 
education about these aspects of their healthcare, and cystic fibrosis 
multidisciplinary teams are ill prepared to counsel their patients.
SUMMARY: Understanding of the effects of cystic fibrosis on SRH continues to 
improve, although many questions remain regarding optimal care from the choice 
of contraception to the safety of cystic fibrosis-specific medications in 
pregnancy. Further development of cystic fibrosis-informed interdisciplinary 
specialist networks and a wider framework of practice would both enhance health 
outcomes and better support patients.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 virus pandemic has caused a significant number of 
deaths worldwide. If the prevalence of the infection continues to grow, this 
could impact life expectancy. This paper provides first estimates of the 
potential direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on period life expectancy.
METHODS: From the estimates of bias-adjusted age-specific infection fatality 
rates in Hubei (China) and a range of six prevalence rate assumptions ranging 
from 1% to 70%, we built a discrete-time microsimulation model that simulates 
the number of people infected by COVID-19, the number dying from it, and the 
number of deaths from all causes week by week for a period of one year. We 
applied our simulation to four broad regions: North America and Europe; Latin 
America and the Caribbean; Southeastern Asia; and sub-Saharan African. For each 
region, 100,000 individuals per each 5-year age group are simulated.
RESULTS: At a 10% COVID-19 prevalence rate, the loss in life expectancy at birth 
is likely above 1 year in North America and Europe and in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. In Southeastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, one year lost in life 
expectancy corresponds to an infection prevalence of about 15% and 25%, 
respectively. Given the uncertainty in fatality rates, with a 50% prevalence of 
COVID-19 infections under 95% prediction intervals, life expectancy would drop 
by 3 to 9 years in North America and Europe, by 3 to 8 years in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, by 2 to 7 years in Southeastern Asia, and by 1 to 4 years in 
sub-Saharan Africa. In all prevalence scenarios, as long as the COVID-19 
infection prevalence rate remains below 1 or 2%, COVID-19 would not affect life 
expectancy in a substantial manner.
INTERPRETATION: In regions with relatively high life expectancy, if the 
infection prevalence threshold exceeds 1 or 2%, the COVID-19 pandemic will break 
the secular trend of increasing life expectancy, resulting in a decline in 
period life expectancy. With life expectancy being a key indicator of human 
development, mortality increase, especially among the vulnerable subgroups of 
populations, would set a country back on its path of human development.

BACKGROUND: Identifying determinants of health and understanding their role in 
health production constitutes an important research theme. We aimed to document 
the state of recent multi-country research on this theme in the literature.
METHODS: We followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines to systematically identify, 
triage and review literature (January 2013-July 2019). We searched for studies 
that performed cross-national statistical analyses aiming to evaluate the impact 
of one or more aggregate level determinants on one or more general population 
health outcomes in high-income countries. To assess in which combinations and to 
what extent individual (or thematically linked) determinants had been studied 
together, we performed multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty studies were selected, out of an original yield of 3686. 
Life-expectancy and overall mortality were the most widely used population 
health indicators, while determinants came from the areas of healthcare, 
culture, politics, socio-economics, environment, labor, fertility, demographics, 
life-style, and psychology. The family of regression models was the predominant 
statistical approach. Results from our multidimensional scaling showed that a 
relatively tight core of determinants have received much attention, as main 
covariates of interest or controls, whereas the majority of other determinants 
were studied in very limited contexts. We consider findings from these studies 
regarding the importance of any given health determinant inconclusive at 
present. Across a multitude of model specifications, different country samples, 
and varying time periods, effects fluctuated between statistically significant 
and not significant, and between beneficial and detrimental to health.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms of 
population health are far from settled, and the present state of research on the 
topic leaves much to be desired. It is essential that future research considers 
multiple factors simultaneously and takes advantage of more sophisticated 
methodology with regards to quantifying health as well as analyzing 
determinants' influence.

Messages to promote health behavior are essential when considering health 
promotion, disease prevention, and healthy life expectancy. The present study 
aimed to examine whether (1) positive and negative goal-framing messages affect 
message memory and behavioral intention differently in younger, middle-aged, and 
older adults, (2) framing effects are mediated by interest in health (health 
promotion and disease prevention) and emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal 
and expressive suppression), and (3) mediation effects differ between positive 
and negative frames. Participants (N = 1248) aged 20 to 70 years were divided 
into positive and negative frame conditions. Framing demonstrated interactive 
effects on message memory; all age groups showed higher recognition accuracy in 
the positive than the negative frame. The accuracy of younger adults was higher 
than that of older adults in the negative frame, while older adults showed 
higher accuracy than younger adults in the positive frame. Additionally, 
recognition accuracy was higher in the positive frame, as participants had 
higher interest in health promotion and used cognitive reappraisal more 
frequently. Contrariwise, emotion regulation and interest in health promotion 
did not have significant effects on memory in negative frames. Moreover, 
regardless of the message valence, age did not influence behavioral intention 
directly but was mediated by interest in health and emotion regulation, while 
the older the participants were, the higher their interest in health, resulting 
in higher intention. For emotion regulation, intention increased with higher 
reappraisal scores and decreased with increasing suppression. Our results 
suggest that interest in health and emotion regulation should be considered when 
examining the relationship between age and goal-framing for health messages.

The majority of patients with refractory, advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) 
or Sézary syndrome (SS) have a life expectancy of <5 years. Here, we report a 
phase 2 study of a novel nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation strategy 
tailored for this patient population. This study has completed the enrollment, 
and 35 patients (13 MF, 22 SS) have undergone transplant as planned. The 
majority (80%) of the patients had stage IV disease and received multiple 
previous systemic therapies. All patients had active disease at the time of 
conditioning using total skin electron beam therapy, total lymphoid irradiation, 
and antithymocyte globulin, and received allograft infusion as outpatients. 
Cyclosporine or tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients tolerated the transplant 
well, with 1- and 2-year nonrelapse mortality of 3% and 14%, respectively. The 
day +180 cumulative incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was 16%, and the 2-year 
incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 32%. With a median posttransplant 
follow-up of 5.4 years, the 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 68%, 
62%, and 56%. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor for 
minimal residual disease monitoring, we observed that 43% achieved molecular 
remission, which was associated with a lower incidence of disease progression or 
relapse (9% vs 87%; P = .02). Our study also showed that patients who were aged 
≥65 years at the time of allotransplant had similar clinical outcomes compared 
with younger patients. Thus, we have developed an alternative and potentially 
curative nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen for patients with 
advanced stage MF/SS. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as 
#NCT00896493.

Chronic pruritus (CP) has considerable implications for QOL. However, its impact 
on health-related QOL and economic burden is not fully characterized. We 
administered a cross-sectional survey on 132 patients with CP using the Health 
Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument. Normative data from healthy adults (n = 
4,187) were obtained from the Joint Canada/US Survey of Health. Quality-adjusted 
life-year loss and economic costs were estimated on the basis of Health 
Utilities Index Mark 3 scores of patients with CP versus controls. Patients with 
CP had lower overall health performance than the control (0.56 ± 0.03 vs. 0.86 ± 
0.003, P < 0.001). In multivariable regression, CP was associated with worse 
overall health performance (coefficient = -0.30, 95% confidence interval = -0.33 
to -0.27), most accentuated in the domains of pain (coefficient = -0.24, 
confidence interval = -0.28 to -0.21) and emotion (coefficient = -0.11, 
confidence interval = -0.13 to -0.10). The reduced Health Utilities Index Mark 3 
score correlated with 5.5 average lifetime quality-adjusted life-years lost per 
patient. Using conservative estimates for willingness to pay, the 
quality-adjusted life-year loss translated to an individual lifetime economic 
burden of $274,921 and a societal burden of $88.8 billion. CP is associated with 
significant QOL impairment. The economic burden of CP highlights the necessity 
for further research into management options.

OBJECTIVE:  The aims of this study were to describe the elastosonographic 
findings of the patellar ligament in healthy dogs >15 kg in different positions 
and determine the most appropriate stifle angle to perform elastosonography of 
the patellar ligament.
STUDY DESIGN:  Eighteen clinically healthy dogs, weighing >15 kg, were 
prospectively recruited. B-mode ultrasound and real-time elastosonography of 
both patellar ligaments were performed on days 0 and 14. Elastosonography 
examinations were performed with the stifle in four positions: standing 
position, lateral recumbency with the stifle positioned at 135 degrees extension 
and in full passive flexion and extension.
RESULTS:  The percentage hardness of the patellar ligament was significantly 
lower when the elastosonographic examination was performed with the dog 
standing, compared with the other positions (p < 0.005). The variability in the 
elastosonography readings for each stifle position was lowest when the dog was 
standing (89.32%).
CONCLUSION:  Elastosonography is a feasible technique for evaluating the 
elasticity of the normal canine patellar ligament in dogs >15 kg and would be a 
useful technique for investigating the mechanical changes within the patellar 
ligament following stifle surgery. Elastosonography of the patellar ligament 
should be performed with the dog standing to provide the most accurate 
elastosonograms with lowest variability between readings.

Human life expectancy is increasing significantly over time thanks to the 
improved possibility for people to take care of themselves and the higher 
availability of food, drugs, hygiene, services, and assistance. The increase in 
the average age of the population worldwide is, however, becoming a real 
concern, since aging is associated with the rapid increase in chronic 
inflammatory pathologies and degenerative diseases, very frequently dependent on 
senescent phenomena that occur alongside with senescence. Therefore, the search 
for reliable biomarkers that can diagnose the possible onset or predict the risk 
of developing a disease associated with aging is a crucial target of current 
medicine. In this review, we construct a synopsis of the main addressable 
biomarkers to study the development of aging and the associated ailments.

BACKGROUND: Road traffic fatalities (RTF) is the 8th cause of mortality around 
the world. At the end of the Decade of Action, it would be of utmost importance 
to revisit our knowledge on the determinants of RTF. The aim of this study is to 
assess factors related to RTF at global level.
METHODS: We used road safety development index which accounts for the 
interactions between system, human and products to assess the RTF in 115 and 113 
countries in 2013 and 2016, respectively. To analyze data, three statistical 
procedures (linear regression, classification and regression trees, and 
multivariate adaptive regression splines) were employed.
RESULTS: Classification and regression trees has the best performance amongst 
all others followed by multivariate adaptive regression splines for 2013 and 
2016 data set with an R2 around 0.83. Results show that any increase in human 
development index was associated with RTF reduction. Comparing RTF data of 2013 
and 2016, 8 countries experienced a change of more than 30%, which demonstrated 
a significant relationship with GINI index (named after Corrado Gini). 
Considering the three components of human development index, it is revealed that 
education explained most of RTF variation in classification and regression trees 
model followed by income and life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Policymakers should consider road collisions as a socio-economic 
issue. In this regard, they can make provisions to reduce RTF in the long run by 
focusing on enhancing the three components of human development index, mainly 
education. However, there is a need to investigate the causation pathway among 
these three components with RTF with different time-trend procedures.

BACKGROUND: Prevention and treatment for locomotive syndrome (LS) are important 
for extending healthy life expectancy. The 25-question geriatric locomotive 
function scale (GLFS-25) was developed to diagnose LS. The Fear-Avoidance model 
was proposed to explain pain chronicity. LS and chronic pain decrease activities 
of daily living; however, the relationships between LS and factors related to 
chronic pain in the Fear-Avoidance model are unknown. Objective of the current 
study was to assess the prevalence of LS and examine the factors of the 
Fear-Avoidance model and the GLFS-25 that affect the prevalence of LS in 
patients with chronic pain.
METHODS: Participants included 281 patients (99 men, 182 women) aged over 40 
years with chronic pain who visited our outpatient clinic for chronic pain. All 
participants completed the GLFS-25, numeric rating scale (NRS), pain 
catastrophizing scale (PCS), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and 
Athene insomnia scale (AIS). According to a GLFS-25 cutoff point, participants
