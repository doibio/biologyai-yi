The demand for regeneration of a degenerated dentition has been increasing as a 
result of the development of societies, where the life expectancy is increasing 
and fighting age-related changes is in focus. Whereas removable dentures were 
acceptable and considered a norm earlier, patients do, to an increasing 
degree,demand fixed prosthetics; consequently, the development of implants has 
had an important impact. The balance in the chewing organ will change with time, 
due to age-related changes within the bone and the loss of teeth due to caries 
or periodontal disease, and malocclusions may develop or aggravate. The 
re-establishment of an aesthetical and functional satisfactory solution cannot 
be reached by replacing teeth by fixed prosthodontics and implants. The aim of 
this update was threefold: firstly, to demonstrate that age-related changes, 
often unnoticed by both the patient and the general dentist, can lead to 
degeneration of the dentition; secondly, to explain how an interdisciplinary 
approach can make regeneration of even severe degeneration possible; and 
finally, to show the importance of the general dentist in the maintenance of the 
obtained results. Treatments should not aim for short-term results but focus on 
maintainable results.

BACKGROUND: Although helicopters are presently an integral part of trauma 
systems in most developed nations, previous reviews and studies to date have 
raised questions about which groups of traumatically injured people derive the 
greatest benefit.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) 
transport, compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) transport, is 
associated with improved morbidity and mortality for adults with major trauma.
SEARCH METHODS: We ran the most recent search on 29 April 2015. We searched the 
Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials; CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE 
Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost), four other sources, and 
clinical trials registers. We screened reference lists.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Eligible trials included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
and nonrandomized intervention studies. We also evaluated nonrandomized studies 
(NRS), including controlled trials and cohort studies. Each study was required 
to have a GEMS comparison group. An Injury Severity Score (ISS) of at least 15 
or an equivalent marker for injury severity was required. We included adults age 
16 years or older.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently extracted data 
and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We applied the Downs and 
Black quality assessment tool for NRS. We analyzed the results in a narrative 
review, and with studies grouped by methodology and injury type. We constructed 
'Summary of findings' tables in accordance with the GRADE Working Group 
criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: This review includes 38 studies, of which 34 studies examined 
survival following transportation by HEMS compared with GEMS for adults with 
major trauma. Four studies were of inter-facility transfer to a higher level 
trauma center by HEMS compared with GEMS. All studies were NRS; we found no 
RCTs. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge. We calculated 
unadjusted mortality using data from 282,258 people from 28 of the 38 studies 
included in the primary analysis. Overall, there was considerable heterogeneity 
and we could not determine an accurate estimate of overall effect.Based on the 
unadjusted mortality data from six trials that focused on traumatic brain 
injury, there was no decreased risk of death with HEMS. Twenty-one studies used 
multivariate regression to adjust for confounding. Results varied, some studies 
found a benefit of HEMS while others did not. Trauma-Related Injury Severity 
Score (TRISS)-based analysis methods were used in 14 studies; studies showed 
survival benefits in both the HEMS and GEMS groups as compared with MTOS. We 
found no studies evaluating the secondary outcome, morbidity, as assessed by 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
Four studies suggested a small to moderate benefit when HEMS was used to 
transfer people to higher level trauma centers. Road traffic and helicopter 
crashes are adverse effects which can occur with either method of transport. 
Data regarding safety were not available in any of the included studies. 
Overall, the quality of the included studies was very low as assessed by the 
GRADE Working Group criteria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to the methodological weakness of the available 
literature, and the considerable heterogeneity of effects and study 
methodologies, we could not determine an accurate composite estimate of the 
benefit of HEMS. Although some of the 19 multivariate regression studies 
indicated improved survival associated with HEMS, others did not. This was also 
the case for the TRISS-based studies. All were subject to a low quality of 
evidence as assessed by the GRADE Working Group criteria due to their 
nonrandomized design. The question of which elements of HEMS may be beneficial 
has not been fully answered. The results from this review provide motivation for 
future work in this area. This includes an ongoing need for diligent reporting 
of research methods, which is imperative for transparency and to maximize the 
potential utility of results. Large, multicenter studies are warranted as these 
will help produce more robust estimates of treatment effects. Future work in 
this area should also examine the costs and safety of HEMS, since multiple 
contextual determinants must be considered when evaluating the effects of HEMS 
for adults with major trauma.

Autophagy-dependent longevity models in C. elegans display altered lipid storage 
profiles, but the contribution of lipid distribution to life-span extension is 
not fully understood. Here we report that lipoprotein production, autophagy and 
lysosomal lipolysis are linked to modulate life span in a conserved fashion. We 
find that overexpression of the yolk lipoprotein VIT/vitellogenin reduces the 
life span of long-lived animals by impairing the induction of autophagy-related 
and lysosomal genes necessary for longevity. Accordingly, reducing 
vitellogenesis increases life span via induction of autophagy and lysosomal 
lipolysis. Life-span extension due to reduced vitellogenesis or enhanced 
lysosomal lipolysis requires nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) NHR-49 and NHR-80, 
highlighting novel roles for these NHRs in lysosomal lipid signaling. In 
dietary-restricted worms and mice, expression of VIT and hepatic APOB 
(apolipoprotein B), respectively, are significantly reduced, suggesting a 
conserved longevity mechanism. Altogether, our study demonstrates that 
lipoprotein biogenesis is an important mechanism that modulates aging by 
impairing autophagy and lysosomal lipolysis.

BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common complication in people with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and mainly develops as a consequence of relative erythropoietin 
(EPO) deficiency. Anaemia develops early in the course of disease and peaks 
among people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Many types of EPO - also 
called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) - are used to treat anaemia in 
people with ESKD.ESAs have changed treatment of severe anaemia among people with 
CKD by relieving symptoms and avoiding complications associated with blood 
transfusion. However, no benefits have been found in relation to mortality rates 
and non-cardiac fatal events, except quality of life. Moreover, a relationship 
between ESA use and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients 
with CKD has been reported in studies with fully correcting anaemia comparing 
with partial anaemia correction. Until 2012, guidelines recommended commencing 
ESA treatment when haemoglobin was less than 11 g/dL; the current recommendation 
is EPO commencement when haemoglobin is between 9 and 10 g/dL. However, 
advantages in commencing therapy when haemoglobin levels are greater than 10 
g/dL but less than 11 g/dL remain unknown, especially among older people whose 
life expectancy is limited, but in whom EPO therapy may improve quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical benefits and harms of early versus delayed 
EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised 
Register to 8 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator 
using search terms relevant to this review.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
and quasi-RCTs evaluating at the clinical benefits and harms of early versus 
delayed EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. Studies comparing EPO with another EPO, placebo or no 
treatment were eligible for inclusion.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: It was planned that two authors would 
independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using 
the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For dichotomous outcomes (all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality, overall myocardial infarction, overall stroke, 
vascular access thrombosis, adverse effects of treatment, transfusion), we 
planned to use the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We 
planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) and CI 95% for continuous data 
(haemoglobin level) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with CI 95% for 
quality of life if different scales had been used.
MAIN RESULTS: Literature searches yielded 1910 records, of these 1534 were 
screened after duplicates removed, of which 1376 were excluded following title 
and abstract assessment. We assessed 158 full text records and identified 18 
studies (66 records) that were potentially eligible for inclusion. However, none 
matched our inclusion criteria and were excluded.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of 
early versus delayed EPO for the anaemia of ESKD.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a heterogeneous and severe autosomal recessive 
inborn error of metabolism most commonly caused by the deficient activity of the 
vitamin B12 dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). The main treatment 
for MMA patients is the dietary restriction of propiogenic amino acids and 
carnitine supplementation. Despite treatment, the prognosis for vitamin B12 
non-responsive patients remains poor and is associated with neonatal lethality, 
persistent morbidity and decreased life expectancy. While multi-organ pathology 
is a feature of MMA, the liver is severely impacted by mitochondrial dysfunction 
which likely underlies the metabolic instability experienced by the patients. 
Liver and/or combined liver/kidney transplantation is therefore sometimes 
performed in severely affected patients. Using liver specimens from donors and 
MMA patients undergoing elective liver transplantation collected under a 
dedicated natural history protocol (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00078078), we 
employed proteomics to characterize the liver pathology and impaired hepatic 
metabolism observed in the patients. Pathway analysis revealed perturbations of 
enzymes involved in energy metabolism, gluconeogenesis and Krebs cycle 
anaplerosis. Our findings identify new pathophysiologic and therapeutic targets 
that could be valuable for designing alternative therapies to alleviate clinical 
manifestations seen in this disorder.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the comparative 
effectiveness of esophagectomy versus endoscopic mucosal resection followed by 
radiofrequency ablation (EMR-RFA) for the treatment of Barrett esophagus with 
high-grade dysplasia (HGD).
BACKGROUND: HGD of the esophagus may be managed by surgical resection or 
EMR-RFA. National guidelines suggest that EMR-RFA is effective at eradicating 
HGD. The comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EMR-RFA versus 
esophagectomy for HGD remains unclear.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model was constructed to represent 3 management 
strategies for HGD: (1) esophagectomy, (2) EMR-RFA, and (3) endoscopic 
surveillance. Estimates for model variables were obtained from literature 
review, and costs were estimated from Medicare fee schedules. Costs and 
utilities were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The baseline model was 
adjusted for alternative age groups and high-risk dysplastic variants. One-way 
and multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: For a 65-year-old patient, compared to esophagectomy, EMR-RFA yields 
equivalent utility (11.5 vs 11.4 discounted quality-adjusted life years) with 
lower total cost ($52.5K vs $74.3K) over the first 20 years. Dominance of 
EMR-RFA over esophagectomy persists for all age groups. Patients with diffuse or 
ulcerated HGD are more effectively treated with esophagectomy. Model outcomes 
are sensitive to estimated rates of disease progression and postintervention 
utility parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence supports EMR-RFA over esophagectomy for the 
treatment of esophageal HGD. Long-term outcomes and more definitive 
quality-of-life studies for both interventions are crucial to better inform 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: In spite of experiencing a large decline in the spread and burden of 
infectious diseases, the Global Burden of Disease Project suggests that about 
30% of the disease burden in India is attributable to infections. The hospital 
data constitute a basic and primary source of information for continuous follow 
up of this changing pattern of morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To identify the pattern and trend of different infectious diseases among 
admissions in the Infectious Disease ward of North Bengal Medical College and 
Hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of inpatient hospital database 
over 5 years period (January 2008 - December 2012) of Infectious Disease ward of 
North Bengal Medical College & Hospital.
RESULTS: Among 3277 admissions in the Infectious Disease ward during 2008-12, 
diarrhoeal diseases (84.3%) were most common. The highest mortality was recorded 
for rabies cases (83.9%), followed by tetanus (32.6%) and diphtheria (27.3%). 
The majority cases of diphtheria (78.9%) and measles (53.1%) belonged to below 9 
years age. Except the year 2010, there was a gradual rise in admissions from 
2008 to 2012.
CONCLUSION: Review of hospital records provided information regarding the 
pattern of diseases but no definite trend among admissions in the infectious 
diseases ward.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing employment among older workers is a policy priority 
given the increase in life expectancy and the drop in labour force participation 
after the age of 50. Reasons for this drop are complex but include poor health, 
age discrimination, inadequate skills/qualifications and caring roles; however, 
limited evidence exists on how best to support this group back to work. The Work 
Programme is the UK Government's flagship policy to facilitate return to work 
(RTW) among those at risk of long-term unemployment. 'Supporting Older People 
Into Employment' (SOPIE) is a mixed-methods longitudinal study involving a 
collaboration between academics and a major Work Programme provider (Ingeus). 
The study will investigate the relationship between health, worklessness and the 
RTW process for the over 50s.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: There are three main study components. Embedded fieldwork 
will document the data routinely collected by Ingeus and the key 
interventions/activities delivered. The quantitative study investigates 
approximately 14,000 individuals (aged 16-64 years, with 20% aged over 50) who 
entered the Ingeus Work Programme (referred to as 'clients') in a 16-month 
period in Scotland and were followed up for 2 years. Employment outcomes 
(including progression towards work) and how they differ by client 
characteristics (including health), intervention components received and 
external factors will be investigated. The qualitative component will explore 
the experiences of clients and Ingeus staff, to better understand the 
interactions between health and (un)employment, Work Programme delivery, and how 
employment services can be better tailored to the needs of the over 50s.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was received from the University of 
Glasgow College of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (application number 
400140186).
RESULTS: Results will be disseminated through journal articles, national and 
international conferences. Findings will inform current and future 
welfare-to-work and job retention initiatives to extend healthy working lives.

[The time of our lives].

Prior to the industrial revolution in the mid-1800 s, the modal lifespan for 
humans was somewhat less than 75 years. Natural life expectancy was 
approximately 35 years, with a high child mortality rate strongly contributing 
to this low figure. At that time, natural life expectancy of someone aged 75 was 
6 years, whereas the current life expectancy of, for example, a 75-year-old 
French woman is 14.5 years. The sharp increase in longevity means an added eight 
years of life in old age. Nevertheless, the rate of ageing, i.e. the degree of 
mortality-risk increase related to age, remains astonishingly constant. 
Preventive strategies that use the absolute risk of age-related diseases for 
setting treatment goals, in fact treat increasing age. For each population, the 
risk reaches its peak at a certain age; over a lifetime, the risk of death is 
always 100%. Under pressure from modern society and medicine, old age is now 
treated as a disease and medicalised to a great degree. To improve medical 
management of elderly patients, we will have to accustom ourselves to consider 
the goals of these actions, to ask ourselves: what is called wisdom?

The coccinellids Eriopis connexa (Germar), Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Olla 
v-nigrum (Mulsant) are important natural biological control agents. The purpose 
of this paper was to study the biology and create a fertility life table of 
these three coccinellid species. For the biology study, 50 insects/species were 
used and kept in groups of 10 in glass vials (2300 cm3). For the three species 
studied, the viability of the total cycle varied from 45 to 50%. O. v-nigrum was 
the species which presented the longest oviposition period. However, H. axiridis 
demonstrated the best reproductive performance and ability of population growth 
in each generation. In conclusion, the use of commercially obtained pollen and 
A. kuenhiella eggs enables the development of coccinellids E. connexa, H. 
axyridis and O. v-nigrum under laboratory conditions, since the insects 
completed their biological cycle and originated adults with good reproductive 
performance.

BACKGROUNDS: Cost-effectiveness analysis plays an important role to guide 
resource allocation decisions, however, information on cost per 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by health facilities is not 
available in many developing economies, including India. We estimated cost per 
DALY averted for 2611 patients admitted for surgical interventions in a 106-bed 
private for-profit hospital in northern India.
METHODS: Costs were calculated using standard costing methods for the financial 
year 2012-2013, and effectiveness was measured in DALYs averted using risk of 
death/disability, effectiveness of treatment and disability weights from 2010 
global burden of disease study.
RESULTS: During the study period, total operating cost of the hospital for 
treating surgical patients was USD 1,554,406 and the hospital averted 9401 DALYs 
resulting in a cost per DALY averted of USD 165.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though this study was based on one hospital in India, however, 
the hospital is a private hospital which is expected to have less surgical case 
load compared to government health facilities, cost per DALY averted for the 
surgical interventions is much lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold for 
India (USD 1508 in 2012). This study therefore provides evidence to re-think the 
common notion that surgical care is expensive and therefore of lower value than 
other health interventions.

BACKGROUND: A validated breast cancer model can be used to compare health 
outcomes associated with different screening strategies.
DATA AND METHODS: The University of Wisconsin Cancer Intervention and 
Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) breast cancer microsimulation model was 
adapted to simulate breast cancer incidence, screening performance and delivery 
of optimal therapies in Canada. The model considered effects of breast density 
on incidence and screening performance. Model predictions of incidence, 
mortality and life-years (LY) gained for a 1960 birth cohort of women for No 
Screening were compared with 11 digital mammography screening strategies that 
varied by starting and stopping age and frequency.
RESULTS: In the absence of screening, the estimate of LYs lost from breast 
cancer was 360.1 per 1,000 women, and each woman diagnosed with breast cancer 
after age 40 who dies of breast cancer would lose an average of 19.1 years. 
Biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 resulted in 116.3 LYs saved. Annual 
screening at ages 40 to 49, followed by biennial screening to age 74, resulted 
in 170.3 LY saved. Screening annually at ages 40 to 74 recovered the most: 214 
LY saved. Annual screening at age 40 resulted in 54 LY gained per 1,000 women. 
More frequent screening was associated with an increased ratio of detection of 
ductal in situ to invasive cancers, more abnormal recalls and more negative 
biopsies, but a reduction in the number of women required to be screened per 
life saved or per LY saved.
INTERPRETATION: In general, mortality reduction was found to be associated with 
the total number of lifetime screens for breast cancer. However, for the same 
number of screens, more frequent screening after age 50 appeared to have a 
greater impact than beginning screening earlier. When the number of LYs saved by 
screening was considered, a greater impact was achieved by screening women in 
their 40s than by reducing the interval between screens.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer screening technology and treatment have improved over 
the past decade. This analysis evaluates the total cost-effectiveness of various 
breast cancer screening strategies in Canada.
DATA AND METHODS: Using the Wisconsin Cancer Intervention and Surveillance 
Monitoring Network (CISNET) breast cancer simulation model adapted to the 
Canadian context, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were evaluated 
for 11 mammography screening strategies that varied by start/stop age and 
screening frequency for the general population. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios are presented, and sensitivity analyses are used to assess the robustness 
of model conclusions.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed that triennial screening 
at ages 50 to 69 was the most cost-effective at $94,762 per QALY. Biennial 
($97,006 per QALY) and annual ($226,278 per QALY) strategies had higher 
incremental ratios.
INTERPRETATION: The benefits and costs of screening rise with the number of 
screens per woman. Decisions about screening strategies may be influenced by 
willingness to pay and the rate of recall for further examination after positive 
screens.

Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) results from an X-linked misexpression of 
proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). This leukodystrophy causes severe hypomyelination 
with progressive inflammation, leading to neurological dysfunctions and 
shortened life expectancy. While no cure exists for PMD, experimental cell-based 
therapy in the dysmyelinated shiverer model suggested that human oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells (hOPCs) or human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) are promising 
candidates to treat myelinopathies. However, the fate and restorative advantages 
of human NPCs/OPCs in a relevant model of PMD has not yet been addressed. Using 
a model of Plp1 overexpression, resulting in demyelination with progressive 
inflammation, we compared side-by-side the therapeutic benefits of 
intracerebrally grafted hNPCs and hOPCs. Our findings reveal equal integration 
of the donor cells within presumptive white matter tracks. While the onset of 
exogenous remyelination was earlier in hOPCs-grafted mice than in hNPC-grafted 
mice, extended lifespan occurred only in hNPCs-grafted animals. This improved 
survival was correlated with reduced neuroinflammation (microglial and 
astrocytosis loads) and microglia polarization toward M2-like phenotype followed 
by remyelination. Thus modulation of neuroinflammation combined with myelin 
restoration is crucial to prevent PMD pathology progression and ensure 
successful rescue of PMD mice. These findings should help to design novel 
therapeutic strategies combining immunomodulation and stem/progenitor cell-based 
therapy for disorders associating hypomyelination with inflammation as observed 
in PMD.

The objective of this study was to analyze the burden of disease due to suicide 
in Mexico using years of life lost (YLL) between 2000 and 2012 by sex, age group 
(for those under 85 years of age) and jurisdiction. Vital statistics on 
mortality and population estimates were used to calculate standardized mortality 
rates and years of life lost due to suicide. Between 2000 and 2012 a sustained 
increase in the suicide mortality rate was observed in Mexico. The age group 
with the highest rate was 85 years of age or older for men, and 15-19 years of 
age for women. The highest impact in life expectancy due to suicide occurred at 
20 to 24 years of age in men and 15 to 19 years of age in women. The states with 
the highest mortality due to suicide were located in the Yucatan Peninsula 
(Yucatan, Quintana Roo and Campeche). Mortality due to suicide in Mexico has 
increased continually. As suicides are preventable, the implementation of health 
public policies through timely identification, integral prevention strategies 
and the detailed study of associated risk factors is imperative.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy, safety, and dose response of tadalafil once 
daily in Japanese men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS).
METHODS: Men ≥45 years with moderate-to-severe BPH-LUTS were randomized to 
once-daily placebo (N = 140), tadalafil 2.5 mg (N = 142), or tadalafil 5.0 mg (N 
= 140), in a 12-week double-blind phase, followed by a 42-week, tadalafil 5.0 mg 
open-label extension (OLE) phase (N = 394). The primary outcome was total 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) change from baseline to last 
available observation in the double-blind phase.
RESULTS: The least squares (LS) mean difference between placebo and tadalafil in 
total IPSS change from baseline was -0.7 (P = 0.201) and -1.1 (P = 0.062) for 
tadalafil 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively (ANCOVA; a dose-dependent improvement in 
placebo-adjusted total IPSS for tadalafil 5 mg versus 2.5 mg of 57%). 
Repeated-measures analyses identified a significant total IPSS change for 
tadalafil 5 mg (LS mean difference between placebo and tadalafil 5 mg: -1.2; P = 
0.035), but not tadalafil 2.5 mg, at week 12. Significant improvements for 
tadalafil 5 mg were demonstrated (ANCOVA) for IPSS obstructive subscore (P = 
0.033) and IPSS quality of life index (P = 0.022). Numerical improvements in 
IPSS scores were maintained over the OLE phase. Tadalafil was well tolerated 
with no unexpected adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Tadalafil (5.0 mg) had a favorable benefit-to-risk profile, 
supporting further investigation of tadalafil (5.0 mg) in Japanese men with 
BPH-LUTS.

Toll-like receptor 13 (TLR13) recognizes a conserved 10-nucleotide sequence from 
bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA, and binding of TLR13 to the target rRNA molecule 
triggers immune responses. Recently, the crystal structure of the TLR13 
ectodomain bound by a 13-nucleotide single-stranded RNA (ssRNA13) was determined 
by using the initial phases provided by a cryo-electron microscopy map of TLR13 
in complex with a 25-nucleotide ssRNA (ssRNA25). This structural snapshot 
describes a unique method for solving the crystal structure of the TLR13-ssRNA13 
complex based on medium-resolution reconstruction of TLR13-ssRNA25 cryo-electron 
microscopy images.

The consideration of patient preferences in decision-making has become more 
important, especially for life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer. This 
paper aims to identify the preferences of lung cancer patients with regard to 
their treatment and involvement in the decision-making process. We conducted a 
systematic literature review from 12 electronic databases and included studies 
published between 2000 and 2012. A total of 20 studies were included in this 
review. These revealed that lung cancer patients do have preferences that should 
be considered in treatment decisions; however, these preferences are not 
homogenous. We found that patients often consider life extension to be more 
important than the health-related quality of life or undesirable side effects. 
This preference seems to depend on patient age. Nausea and vomiting are the most 
important side effects to be avoided; the relevance of other side effects 
differs highly between subgroups. The majority of lung cancer patients, 
nevertheless, seem to prefer a passive rather than an active role in 
decision-making, although the self-reported preferences differed partly from the 
physicians' perceptions. Overall, we identified an urgent need for larger 
studies that are suitable for subgroup analyses and incorporate 
multi-attributive measurement techniques.

Caloric restriction (CR), a reduction in calorie intake without malnutrition, 
retards aging in several animal models from worms to mammals. Developing CR 
mimetics, compounds that reproduce the longevity benefits of CR without its side 
effects, is of widespread interest. Here, we employed the Connectivity Map to 
identify drugs with overlapping gene expression profiles with CR. Eleven 
statistically significant compounds were predicted as CR mimetics using this 
bioinformatics approach. We then tested rapamycin, allantoin, trichostatin A, 
LY-294002 and geldanamycin in Caenorhabditis elegans. An increase in lifespan 
and healthspan was observed for all drugs except geldanamycin when fed to 
wild-type worms, but no lifespan effects were observed in eat-2 mutant worms, a 
genetic model of CR, suggesting that life-extending effects may be acting via 
CR-related mechanisms. We also treated daf-16 worms with rapamycin, allantoin or 
trichostatin A, and a lifespan extension was observed, suggesting that these 
drugs act via DAF-16-independent mechanisms, as would be expected from CR 
mimetics. Supporting this idea, an analysis of predictive targets of the drugs 
extending lifespan indicates various genes within CR and longevity networks. We 
also assessed the transcriptional profile of worms treated with either rapamycin 
or allantoin and found that both drugs use several specific pathways that do not 
overlap, indicating different modes of action for each compound. The current 
work validates the capabilities of this bioinformatic drug repositioning method 
in the context of longevity and reveals new putative CR mimetics that warrant 
further studies.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or 
sorbitol, untreated hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is characterized by 
metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hypophosphatemia, 
hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperalaninemia) and clinical findings (nausea, 
vomiting, and abdominal distress; chronic growth restriction / failure to 
thrive). While untreated HFI typically first manifested when fructose- and 
sucrose-containing foods were introduced in the course of weaning young infants 
from breast milk, it is now presenting earlier, due to the addition of 
fructose-containing nutrients in infant formulas. If the infant ingests large 
quantities of fructose, the infant may acutely develop lethargy, seizures, 
and/or progressive coma. Untreated HFI may result in renal and hepatic failure. 
If identified and treated before permanent organ injury occurs, individuals with 
HFI can experience a normal quality of life and life expectancy.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of HFI is established in a proband with 
suggestive metabolic disturbances and clinical findings following dietary 
exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol and either biallelic pathogenic 
variants in ALDOB identified on molecular genetic testing or – now rarely – 
deficient hepatic fructose 1-phosphate aldolase (aldolase B) activity on liver 
biopsy. Note: Fructose tolerance testing ("fructose challenge") in the diagnosis 
of HFI should be avoided because it is dangerous and, when used in the past, 
could result in death. Potential sources of fructose should be removed 
immediately if HFI is suspected.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Acute manifestations (e.g., lethargy, 
seizures, or progressive coma and/or renal and hepatic failure) should be 
managed symptomatically in a hospital setting, including administration of 
intravenous glucose (dextrose), supportive treatment of hepatic and/or renal 
insufficiency, and treatment of metabolic acidosis, if present. Prevention of 
primary manifestations: Dietary restriction of fructose, sucrose, sucralose, and 
sorbitol is the cornerstone of HFI treatment. During hospitalizations, special 
caution is advised to avoid use of fructose-containing intravenous fluids, as 
well as fructose-containing infant formulas and pharmaceuticals. Given that 
reduced fruit and vegetable intake is a dietary requirement, daily
