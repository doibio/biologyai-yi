BACKGROUND: Indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
aortic stenosis are expanding and the life expectancy of patients following TAVI 
is increasing. Determining the long-term durability of TAVI valves is therefore 
important. Rates of long-term (≥5 years) structural valve deterioration (SVD) 
vary widely and there are currently no comparable data from Australia. The aim 
herein was to determine the incidence of haemodynamic SVD and bioprosthetic 
valve failure (BVF) using recently standardised definitions in a Western 
Australian cohort after at least 5 years.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing 
TAVI at Royal Perth Hospital between January 2009 and January 2015. Of 211 
patients, 55 survived ≥5 years and had echocardiographic data available for 
review. Median time to the echocardiogram was 5.9 years (max 7.8 years); 49% 
male, mean age 83 years.
RESULTS: Of the 55 survivors who had echocardiograms available ≥5 years after 
TAVI, four (9%) had moderate haemodynamic SVD and one (2%) had severe SVD and 
BVF.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest excellent long-term durability of contemporary 
TAVI valves in an Australian cohort with very low incidence of SVD and BVF. 
These findings add confidence to the expanding applications of TAVI valves.

BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant genetic 
tumour syndrome with poor prognosis. The clinical manifestation was found to be 
more serious in affected offspring of patients with VHL disease, but the risk 
factors and survival for them have never been reported before. We aimed to 
explore how these patients were influenced by genetic and clinical factors.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected 372 affected offspring of VHL 
patients from 118 unrelated VHL families. Patients were stratified into 
different groups based on sets of variables. The age-related risk, overall 
survival and central nervous systemhaemangioblastoma (CHB)-specific survival 
were analysed between different groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and 
Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: The estimated median life expectancy and median age of onset for 
affected offspring of VHL patients were 66 years and 28 years, respectively. The 
later generation and patients with mutations in exon 3 had an earlier onset age. 
The first presenting symptom was the only independent risk factor influencing 
overall survival and CHB-specific survival. Patients that the first presenting 
symptom is central nervous system (CNS) significantly had a lower life 
expectancy both in overall survival and CHB-specific survival analysis than 
abdominal lesions group.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that affected offspring of VHL patients with 
CNS as the first presenting symptom was an independent risk factor for overall 
survival and CHB-specific survival. Generation and mutation region only had an 
effect on the onset age, which is helpful to clinical decision-making and 
generate a more precise surveillance protocol.

Nowadays, the health level of residents has become the focus of people's 
attention. Under the background of the development of health service from 
"disease-centered" to "health-centered," it is very important to improve the 
level of urban health and clarify the factors affecting urban health. Therefore, 
this paper quantifies the relationship between residents' health literacy level 
and environment, average life expectancy, infectious disease mortality, and 
other indicators by selecting appropriate indicators and establishing a 
mathematical model. Based on the reciprocal linear combination of the collected 
index data and the corresponding health level value, the prediction model of 
social health literacy level (SPM) was established, and the qualitative 
prediction and quantitative analysis of citizens' health literacy level were 
studied in depth. Based on the SPM model, we can roughly predict the level of 
health literacy in a region only based on the main variables identified in this 
paper. The consistency of the experiment shows that the model is effective and 
robust, and it reveals that environmental factors are the most important factors 
affecting residents' health literacy level. The actual data show that THE SPM 
model is a timely and reasonable framework to measure the health literacy level 
of residents.

BACKGROUND: Large disparities in life expectancy exist across US states and the 
gaps have been widening in recent decades. Less is known about the lifespan 
variability - a measure that can provide important insights into mortality 
inequalities both between and within states.
METHOD: Using yearly lifetables from the United States Mortality Database, we 
explore geographic and temporal patterns in lifespan variation (unconditional 
and conditional on survival to age 10, 35 and 65) across US states between 1959 
and 2017. We also examine the contribution of state differences in life 
expectancy to overall lifespan variation using standard decomposition 
techniques.
RESULTS: Despite overall convergence in lifespan variation across states over 
the last six decades, in more recent years there has been notable divergence. 
Gender-specific analyses show that lifespan variation was generally greater 
among males than among females; but this pattern reverses for mortality past age 
65. Much of the state disparities in lifespan variation, unconditional and 
conditional on survival to age 10 and 35, were due to mortality differences 
under the age 65. Decomposition analysis shows that while within-state 
variability remains the primary driver of overall lifespan variation, the 
contribution of cross-state differences in life expectancy is growing.
CONCLUSIONS: Variation in longevity is greater within US States than between 
them, yet cross-states disparities in mortality are increasing. This likely 
reflects the long-term consequences of rising social, economic, and political 
stratification for health inequalities both within and across states.

The Hawaiian flower thrips, Thrips hawaiiensis (Morgan), a common 
flower-inhabiting thrip, is now a potential pest globally. Effective control of 
T. hawaiiensis requires information about the effects of temperature on its 
ontogeny and population growth. In this study, the life history characteristics 
and demography of T. hawaiiensis were defined at eight temperatures (9-35°C). 
Additionally, the thermal constant and temperature threshold were estimated by 
regression analysis. The developmental duration and longevity of T. hawaiiensis 
decreased with an increase in temperature between 16°C and 32°C; females 
survived for longer than males at all temperatures. The lower temperature 
threshold and thermal constant of preadult T. hawaiiensis were 10.5°C and 132.5 
degree-days, respectively. The oviposition days of the females gradually 
decreased from 16°C to 32°C, and net maternity was higher at 20°C than at 16°C, 
even though the same number of eggs were laid at both temperatures. The mean 
longevities of the populations were greatest at 20°C; the life expectancy and 
reproductive value decreased with temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase 
and finite rate of increase were significantly highest at 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. 
Population growth was triggered at 12.3°C, and reached a peak at approximately 
27°C when it proliferated to the largest population size. Therefore, the results 
suggest that although the population of T. hawaiiensis starts to grow at lower 
temperatures, it adapts to a wide range of temperatures, and these findings 
facilitate prediction of different stages of damage, population size, and 
seasonal occurrence of T. hawaiiensis.

INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory skin disease 
affecting 2-4% of the general population, which nowadays is even perceived as a 
systemic illness. The nature of this dermatosis may negatively influence 
patients' general condition, life expectancy, and quality of life, which 
highlights the severity of the problem and the need to perform further 
investigation. We aimed to assess quality of life, stress severity, and physical 
activity of patients with psoriasis in relation to demographic and clinical data 
and comparison to the control group without dermatoses.
METHODS: A set of surveys was conducted in 56 patients with psoriasis 
hospitalized at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Bialystok. 
Questionnaires used involved the Dermatology Life Quality Index, WHO Quality of 
Life questionnaire, International Questionnaire of Physical Activity, and a 
self-invented stress survey. Obtained data were compared to a sex- and 
age-matched control group without dermatoses. Statistical analysis was performed 
using GraphPad Prism.
RESULTS: Patients with psoriasis were found to be significantly less satisfied 
with their health and had lower scores in WHO social, environmental, and 
psychological domains, comparing to controls. Patients reported higher stress 
severity and lower satisfaction with sex life and physical appearance than 
controls. Patients with psoriasis also tended to perform less intensive physical 
activity than controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the perception of psoriasis as not only 
affecting skin but also having a multifactorial impact on psychological and 
internal condition. Described lifestyle abnormalities can be easily evaluated 
with validated questionnaires, which could be introduced to patients in order to 
raise their awareness of comorbidities and mobilize them to modify incorrect 
lifestyle habits. Screening for other disorders and introduction of a holistic 
approach to every patient could be beneficial because the improvement of 
patients' life quality is one of the most important issues.

Gregarious behaviours are common in animals and provide various benefits such as 
food acquisition and protection against predators. Many gregarious tropical 
species are shifting poleward under current ocean warming, creating novel 
species and social interactions with local temperate taxa. However, how the 
dynamics of these novel shoals might be altered by future ocean warming and 
acidification remains untested. Here we evaluate how novel species interactions, 
ocean acidification and warming affect shoaling dynamics, motor lateralization 
and boldness of range-extending tropical and co-shoaling temperate fishes under 
controlled laboratory conditions. Fishes were exposed to 1 of 12 treatments 
(combinations of three temperature levels, two pCO2  levels and two shoal type 
levels: mixed species or temperate only) for 38 days. Lateralization (a measure 
of asymmetric expression of cognitive function in group coordination and 
predator escape) of tropical and temperate species was right-side biased under 
present-day conditions, but side bias significantly diminished in tropical and 
temperate fishes under ocean acidification. Ocean acidification also decreased 
shoal cohesion irrespective of shoaling type, with mixed-species shoals showing 
significantly lower cohesion than temperate-only shoals irrespective of climate 
stressors. Tropical fish became bolder under ocean acidification (after 4 
weeks), and temperate fish became bolder with increasing temperature, while 
ocean acidification dampened temperate fish boldness. Our findings highlight the 
direct effect of climate stressors on fish behaviour and the interplay with the 
indirect effects of novel species interactions. Because strong shoal cohesion 
and lateralization are key determinants of species fitness, their degradation 
under ocean warming and acidification could adversely affect species performance 
in novel assemblages in a future ocean, and might slow down tropical species 
range extensions.

BACKGROUND: Extending endocrine therapy from 5 to 10 years is recommended for 
women with invasive estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. We evaluated 
the benefits and harms of the five additional years of therapy.
METHODS: An established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) 
model used a lifetime horizon with national and clinical trial data on treatment 
efficacy and adverse events and other-cause mortality among multiple birth 
cohorts of U.S. women ages 25-79 newly diagnosed with ER+, non-metastatic breast 
cancer. We assumed 100% use of therapy. Outcomes included life years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and breast cancer mortality. Results were 
discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses tested a 15-year time horizon and 
alternative assumptions.
RESULTS: Extending tamoxifen therapy duration among women ages 25-49 reduced the 
lifetime probability of breast cancer death from 11.9% to 9.3% (absolute 
difference 2.6%). This translates to a gain of 0.77 LYs (281 days)/woman 
(undiscounted). Adverse events reduce this gain to 0.44 QALYs and after 
discounting, gains are 0.20 QALYs (73 days)/woman. Extended aromatase inhibitor 
therapy in women 50-79 had small absolute benefits and gains were offset by 
adverse events (loss of 0.06 discounted QALYs). There were greater gains with 
extended endocrine therapy for women with node-positive versus negative cancers, 
but only women ages 25-49 and 50-59 had a net QALY gain. All gains were reduced 
with less than 100% treatment completion.
CONCLUSION: The extension of endocrine therapy from 5 to 10 years modestly 
improved lifetime breast cancer outcomes, but in some women, treatment-related 
adverse events may outweigh benefits.

In a Stationary Population, the Average Lifespan of the Living Is a 
Length-Biased Life Expectancy.

What is the average lifespan in a stationary population viewed at a single 
moment in time? Even though periods and cohorts are identical in a stationary 
population, we show that the answer to this question is not life expectancy but 
a length-biased version of life expectancy. That is, the distribution of 
lifespans of the people alive at a single moment is a self-weighted distribution 
of cohort lifespans, such that longer lifespans have proportionally greater 
representation. One implication is that if death rates are unchanging, the 
average lifespan of the current population always exceeds period life 
expectancy. This result connects stationary population lifespan measures to a 
well-developed body of statistical results; provides new intuition for 
established demographic results; generates new insights into the relationship 
between periods, cohorts, and prevalent cohorts; and offers a framework for 
thinking about mortality selection more broadly than the concept of demographic 
frailty.

Insect epithelial cells contain unique cellular extensions such as bristles, 
hairs, and scales. In contrast to bristle and hair, which are not divergent in 
their shape, scale morphology shows high diversity. In our attempt to 
characterize the role of the insect-specific gene, Spindle-F (spn-F), in 
mosquito development, we revealed a scale-type specific requirement for the 
mosquito Aedes aegypti spn-F homologue. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated Ae-spn-F 
mutants and found that Ae-spn-F is an essential gene, but we were able to 
recover a few adult escapers. These escapers could not fly nor move, and died 
after 3 to 4 days. We found that in Ae-spn-F mutants, only the tip part of the 
bristle was affected with bulbous with misoriented ribs. We also show that in 
Ae-spn-F mutants, only in falcate scales, which are curved with a sharp or 
narrowly rounded apex, and not in other scale types, the tip region is strongly 
affected. Our analysis also revealed that in contrast to Drosophila spn-F, which 
show strong defects in both the actin and microtubule (MT) network in the 
bristle, the Ae-spn-F gene is required only for MT organization in scales and 
bristles. In summary, our results reveal that Ae-spn-F is required for shaping 
tapered epithelial cellular extension structures, namely, the bristle and 
falcate scales by affecting MT organization.

If somatic stem cells would be able to maintain their regenerative capacity over 
time, this might, to a great extent, resolve rejuvenation issues. Unfortunately, 
the pool of somatic stem cells is limited, and they undergo cell aging with a 
consequent loss of functionality. During the last decade, low molecular weight 
compounds that are able to induce or enhance cell reprogramming have been 
reported. They were named "Small Molecules" (SMs) and might present definite 
advantages compared to the exogenous introduction of stemness-related 
transcription factors (e.g. Yamanaka's factors). Here, we undertook a systemic 
analysis of SMs and their potential gene targets. Data mining and curation lead 
to the identification of 92 SMs. The SM targets fall into three major functional 
categories: epigenetics, cell signaling, and metabolic "switchers". All these 
categories appear to be required in each SM cocktail to induce cell 
reprogramming. Remarkably, many enriched pathways of SM targets are related to 
aging, longevity, and age-related diseases, thus connecting them with cell 
reprogramming. The network analysis indicates that SM targets are highly 
interconnected and form protein-protein networks of a scale-free topology. The 
extremely high contribution of hubs to network connectivity suggests that (i) 
cell reprogramming may require SM targets to act cooperatively, and (ii) their 
network organization might ensure robustness by resistance to random failures. 
All in all, further investigation of SMs and their relationship with longevity 
regulators will be helpful for developing optimal SM cocktails for cell 
reprogramming with a perspective for rejuvenation and life span extension.

The present study was done to identify the viral diversity, seasonality and 
burden associated with childhood acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in Sri 
Lanka. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of hospitalized children (1 month-5 years) 
with ARTI were collected in 2 centers (wet and dry zones) from March 2013 to 
August 2014. Respiratory viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence assay 
(IFA) was used to identify the infecting viruses. IFA negative 100 NPA samples 
were tested for human metapeumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus and corona viruses 
by polymerase chain reaction. Of the 443 and 418 NPAs, 37.2% and 39.4% were 
positive for any of the 8 different respiratory viruses tested from two centers 
studied. Viral co-infection was detected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
in both centers. Peak viral detection was noted in the wet zone from May-July 
2013 and 2014 and in the dry zone from December-January 2014 suggesting a local 
seasonality for viral ARTI. RSV showed a clear seasonality with a direct 
correlation of monthly RSV infections with rainy days in the wet zone and an 
inverse correlation with temperature in both centers. The case fatality rate was 
2.7% for RSV associated ARTI. The overall disability adjusted life years was 
335.9 and for RSV associated ARTI it was 241.8. RSV was the commonly detected 
respiratory virus with an annual seasonality and distribution in rainy seasons 
in the dry and wet zones of Sri Lanka. Identifying the virus and seasonality 
will contribute to employ preventive measures and reduce the empirical use of 
antibiotics in resource limited settings.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a severe illness that frequently 
manifests before the age of 18 years, often recurring later in life. Paediatric 
medical treatment options are scarce. The melatonin receptor agonist and 
5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptor antagonist agomelatine is used to treat adults, 
and could offer a new therapeutic option for paediatric patients. Therefore, we 
aimed to investigate the short-term antidepressant efficacy and safety of 
agomelatine in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder.
METHODS: We performed a 12 week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 
multicentre, phase 3 trial in 46 specialist psychiatric units or centres in 
Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, and 
Ukraine. Participants (aged 7-17 years) were eligible if they were unresponsive 
to psychosocial therapy during the 3-week run-in period (Children's Depression 
Rating Scale-revised [CDRS-R] score of ≥45). Ethnicity was not recorded. We 
investigated short-term antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine (10 mg or 25 mg 
per day) versus placebo with an active control (fluoxetine 10-20 mg depending on 
symptom severity) after 12 weeks of treatment in children (aged 7-11 years) and 
adolescents (12-17 years) with major depressive disorder. Patients were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1:1) to agomelatine 10 mg, agomelatine 25 mg, placebo, or 
fluoxetine via an interactive response system with permuted-block randomisation. 
Standardised manualised psychosocial counselling, developed for this trial, was 
initiated from selection and continued throughout the study, including the 
open-label extension. All people involved in the conduct of the clinical trial 
and patients were masked to treatment allocation. Study outcomes were measured 
using standardised interviews at each study visit. The primary endpoint was 
change in CDRS-R raw score from baseline to week 12. This study is registered 
with EudraCT, 2015-002181-23.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 2016, and Jan 14, 2020, 466 individuals were assessed 
for eligibility and of 400 included patients, 396 (247 [62%] girls, 149 [38%] 
boys; mean age 13·7 years [SD 2·7]) were analysed (full analysis set). The 
primary objective was met; 25 mg/day agomelatine (n=94, with n=102 receiving 10 
mg/day) resulted in an improvement versus placebo (n=101) in CDRS-R raw score of 
4·22 (95% CI 0·63-7·82; p=0·040) at 12 weeks, with a similar effect for 
fluoxetine (n=99), establishing assay sensitivity. The overall effect was 
confirmed in adolescents (n=317), but not in children (n=79). No unexpected 
safety signals were observed with agomelatine, with no significant weight gain 
or effect on suicidal behaviours.
INTERPRETATION: This first study in a paediatric population supports the 
efficacy of 25 mg/day agomelatine, in addition to psychosocial counselling, in 
treating adolescent patients with major depressive disorder, with no unexpected 
safety signals. This medication could provide another option in the limited 
psychopharmaceutical repertoire for management of major depressive disorder.

OBJECTIVES: Degenerative diseases are associated with lower healthy life 
expectancy and higher mortality. Physical activity (PA) has demonstrated a 
fundamental role in the prevention and control of several pathologies associated 
to the aging process. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of PA 
with the prevalence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in 
non-institutionalized American population.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out in participants aged ≥50 years from 
the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 
Sarcopenia was defined using appendicular lean mass adjusted for body mass index 
(ALM:BMI; men <0.789 kg/m2, women <0.512 kg/m2). Osteoporosis was defined as 
bone mineral density T-score ≤-2.5 of femur neck. Osteoarthritis and PA were 
self-reported, and total PA was used to classify participants in groups. The 
Odds Ratios among the different PA levels for each disease were examined.
RESULTS: Performing at least 150 MET-min/week of PA was associated with reduced 
odds for sarcopenia; performing >1800 MET-min/week was associated with reduced 
odds for osteoporosis; and performing 150-1800 MET-min/week of PA was associated 
with reduced odds for osteoarthritis after adjust the results by several 
confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of PA in sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis 
prevention are evident among Americans aged ≥50 years.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate that splenic artery embolization (SAE) is more 
cost-effective than splenectomy from a societal perspective in the Netherlands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-level data obtained from the SPLENIQ study were 
used to populate a health economic model and were supplemented with expert 
opinion when necessary. Propensity score matching was used to correct for 
baseline differences in injury severity scores. The health economic model 
consisted of 3 health states (complications after intervention, SAE failure, and 
recovery) and a dead state. Model outcomes were incremental quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and incremental costs of SAE over splenectomy. The Dutch 
health economic guidelines were followed. The model used a lifetime time 
horizon. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing SAE had a higher life expectancy than patients 
undergoing splenectomy. Incremental QALYs were 3.1 (mostly explained by 
difference in life expectancy), and incremental costs were €34,135 (explained by 
costs related to medical consumption and lost productivity in additional life 
years), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €11,010 per QALY. 
SAE was considered cost-effective in >95% of iterations using a threshold of 
€20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: SAE results in more QALYs than splenectomy. Intervention costs for 
SAE are lower than that for splenectomy, but medical consumption and 
productivity costs in later years are higher for SAE due to better survival. SAE 
was found to be cost-effective compared with splenectomy under appropriate Dutch 
cost-effectiveness thresholds.

The development towards targeted treatments in oncology has been accompanied by 
significant improvements in molecular imaging. Yet, broad application of novel 
imaging techniques has partly been slowed down due to economical considerations. 
Building on the broad positive evidence of its diagnostic accuracy, modelling of 
effects on long-term costs and effectiveness may help to foster a broader 
application and acceptance of comprehensive molecular imaging techniques, such 
as PET/MRI. In this article, common economic evaluation techniques and 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) evaluation methods will be introduced 
including Markov models and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). This 
is complemented with a review of literature on recently published 
cost-effectiveness of molecular imaging. Additionally, the strategic relevance 
of CEAs for the molecular imaging community is discussed and combined with a 
global outlook.

GROUNDPLANS AND EXEMPLARS: PATHS TO THE TREE OF LIFE.

Australia.

- During cladistic analysis of a diverse higher taxon it is impractical to code 
every species as a separate terminal. In such cases, workers proceed in one of 
two distinct ways: (1) examine a number of member species in order to deduce 
groundplan character states of the higher group before the analysis is begun, 
here called the intuitive method, or (2), code a number of real species 
belonging to the group as terminals in the analysis, called the exemplar method. 
Both methods have the same aim, to estimate the groundplan of the higher taxon 
concerned. Both groundplan estimation methods will lead to identical results 
when the character in question has the same state in all members of the terminal 
group, however when the character has two or more states, the two methods may 
give different results. The precise methods employed in the intuitive approach 
have not been articulated in the literature, but possible techniques may result 
in non-parsimonious ancestral state assignments, even in simple cases. 
Groundplan estimation in the exemplar method is an extension of parsimony. The 
exemplar method allows groundplan state/s at internal nodes to be calculated 
during tree search. In many cases the exemplar method assigns a number of 
possible states to the groundplan, and the state assignment is therefore 
equivocal. This is not a deficiency of the method but reflects the notion that 
the parsimony criterion alone cannot always distinguish a single state present 
in a hypothetical ancestor. The optimal choice of exemplars required to estimate 
the groundplan most efficiently is discussed under a simple and common 
hypothesis of character transformation. For complex character distributions up 
to three exemplars may be required, each from a separate lineage of the group 
close to its hypothetical common ancestral node.

OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of pembrolizumab for persistent, recurrent, or 
metastatic cervical cancer has been demonstrated. We aimed to evaluate its 
cost-effectiveness from the United States (US) healthcare payers perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model over a 30-year lifetime horizon was 
developed to compare the cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus placebo 
based on clinical data from the KEYNOTE-826 phase 3 randomized trial. Costs and 
health state utilities were obtained from literature and publicly available 
databases. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: For the Intention-to-Treat patients, pembrolizumab was associated with 
an additional 0.74 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at an additional cost of 
$182,271 when compared with placebo. The ICER was $247,663/QALY. For patients 
with a programmed death-ligand 1 combined positive score ≥ 1 and 10, the ICER 
was $253,322/QALY and $214,212/QALY, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses 
showed that pembrolizumab had the greatest impact on the ICER. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses showed that the probability of pembrolizumab being 
cost-effective was zero at the current willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$150,000/QALY. The price of pembrolizumab had to reduce at least to $28.336 
(55.8% of the current price) for it to be cost-effective in a 50% of chance.
CONCLUSION: The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is costly and might 
not be cost-effective for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer 
at the current price in the US.

Direct RNA detection is critical for providing the RNA insights into gene 
expression profiling, noncoding RNAs, RNA-associated diseases and pathogens, 
without reverse transcription. However, classical RNA analysis usually requires 
RT-PCR, which can cause bias amplification and quantitation errors. To address 
this challenge, herein we report a microfluidic RNA chip (the microchip 
prototype) for direct RNA detection, which is primarily based on RNA extension 
and labeling with DNA polymerase. This detection strategy is of high specificity 
(discriminating against single-nucleotide differences), rapidity, accuracy, 
nuclease resistance, and reusability. Further, we have successfully detected 
disease-associated RNAs in clinical samples, demonstrating its great potentials 
in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) significantly reduces inappropriate 
antibiotic use and improves patient outcomes. In low-resource settings, AMS 
implementation may require concurrent strengthening of clinical microbiology 
capacity therefore additional investments. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of
