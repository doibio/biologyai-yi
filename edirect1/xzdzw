and refusal of RT. The primary outcomes were breast cancer-specific survival 
(BCSS) and overall survival (OS). Chi-squared tests, Kaplan-Meier method, and 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to minimize the potential 
selection bias.
RESULTS: A total of 26586 patients were included in this analysis. The median 
follow-up was 66 months. Of these patients, 15591 (58.6%) patients received RT, 
RT was recommended but not performed due to patient refusal for 1270 (4.8%) 
patients, and RT was not recommended for 9725 (36.6%) patients. The 5-year BCSS 
was 98.3% for patients receiving RT, 97.1% for patients refusal of RT, and 96.4% 
for patients not recommended RT (P<0.001). The 5-year OS was 88.6% for patients 
receiving RT, 77.6% for patients who refused RT, and 72.1% for patients not 
recommended RT (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 
patients who received adjuvant RT after BCS had significantly better BCSS 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.523, 95%confidence interval [CI] 0.447-0.612, P<0.001) and 
OS (HR 0.589, 95%CI 0.558-0.622, P<0.001) compared to those without RT. A total 
of 7721 pairs of patients were matched successfully between those with and 
without RT using PSM. The results also showed that patients who received RT 
after BCS had significantly better BCSS (HR 562, 95%CI 0.467-0.676, P<0.001) and 
OS (HR 0.612, 95%CI 0.0.575-0.652, P<0.001) compared to those without RT.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that individual counseling is important for 
treatment decision-making in elderly breast cancer patients with T1-2N0 and 
ER-positive disease. Given the relatively lower toxicity of modern RT 
techniques, adjuvant RT should be recommended in patients with high life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: β-thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder resulting in 
ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. Management of anemia with regular blood 
transfusions is associated with complications including iron overload. Here, we 
report long-term safety and efficacy results of the first clinical study of 
luspatercept in β-thalassemia, initiated in 2013, enrolling adults with both 
nontransfusion-dependent (NTD) and transfusion-dependent (TD) β-thalassemia.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to report long-term safety data, for up to 5 years 
of treatment, for 64 patients with TD or NTD β-thalassemia, and long-term 
efficacy data for a subset of 63 patients with β-thalassemia who received 
high-dose luspatercept (0.6-1.25 mg/kg): 31 NTD and 32 TD patients.
DESIGN: The study was a phase 2, noncontrolled, open-label trial comprising a 
dose-finding base phase and a 5-year extension phase.
METHODS: Endpoints include safety; erythroid response over a continuous 12-week 
period [NTD: hemoglobin increase from baseline ⩾1.0 or ⩾1.5 g/dl; TD: red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion burden reduction, ⩾20%, ⩾33%, or ⩾50%]; and changes in 
biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis, iron metabolism parameters, Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) scores, and 6-min 
walking distance.
RESULTS: Median duration of luspatercept exposure for NTD and TD patients was 
910 days (range, 40-1850) and 433 days (range, 21-1790), respectively. Seventeen 
of 31 (54.8%) NTD patients achieved a mean hemoglobin increase of ⩾1.5 g/dl and 
19 of 32 (59.4%) TD patients achieved ⩾50% reduction in RBC transfusion burden, 
during any continuous 12-week period. Median cumulative duration of response was 
1126 days (range, 127-1790) for NTD patients and 909 days (range, 87-1734) for 
TD patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were 
bone pain, headache, and myalgia.
CONCLUSION: Long-term assessment of patients with β-thalassemia showed 
luspatercept was associated with sustained increases in hemoglobin levels in NTD 
patients and sustained transfusion burden reductions in TD patients.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01749540 and 
NCT02268409).
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Long-term safety and erythroid response with 
luspatercept treatment in patients with β-thalassemia Background: β-thalassemia 
is a genetic blood disorder caused by mutations in the β-globin gene, which 
encodes one of the proteins that comprise hemoglobin, a key constituent of red 
blood cells. Patients with β-thalassemia experience anemia, the main treatment 
for which is blood transfusions. Long-term repeated blood transfusions lower 
patients' quality of life, use hospital resources, and the resulting 
accumulation of excess iron can cause organ failure and decrease life 
expectancy. The severity of the anemia experienced by patients with 
β-thalassemia varies; patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia require 
regular blood transfusions, compared with those with nontransfusion-dependent 
β-thalassemia who require infrequent transfusions, or even none at all, to 
manage their symptoms. Luspatercept (Reblozyl®) is an agent that stimulates the 
production of red blood cells and is used to treat anemia caused by 
β-thalassemia. However, the long-term effects of luspatercept treatment on 
patients with β-thalassemia are not known.Objective: In this study, we report 
the long-term safety of luspatercept in 64 adult patients with either 
transfusion-dependent or nontransfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, and the 
long-term efficacy of high-dose luspatercept (0.6-1.25 mg/kg) in a subset of 63 
patients.Results: The average time period that patients were treated with 
luspatercept was 910 days for nontransfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and 
433 days for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. We report that in patients 
with nontransfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, luspatercept treatment was 
associated with sustained increases, just over 3 years, in hemoglobin levels. 
Likewise, in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, luspatercept treatment was 
associated with a sustained reduction, 2.5 years, in the amount of blood 
transfusion required to manage their anemia. Long-term treatment with 
luspatercept was not associated with any new side effects compared with previous 
short-term treatment studies. The most common side effects were headache (27 
patients), bone pain (20 patients), and muscle pain (14 patients) with more than 
90% of these patients experiencing these side effects as mild 
severity.Conclusion: The results of this study show that in patients with either 
transfusion-dependent or nontransfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, luspatercept 
provides lasting reduction in anemia with mostly mild and predictable side 
effects.

Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure worldwide. Patients with 
diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also at markedly higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure (HF), and death. Through the 
processes of gluconeogenesis and glucose reabsorption, the kidney plays a 
central role in glucose homeostasis. Insulin resistance is an early alteration 
observed in CKD, worsened by the frequent presence of hypertension, obesity, and 
ongoing chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Management of diabetes in 
moderate to severe CKD warrants special consideration because of changes in 
glucose and insulin homeostasis and altered metabolism of glucose-lowering 
therapies. Kidney failure and initiation of kidney replacement therapy by 
dialysis adds to management complexity by further limiting therapeutic options, 
and predisposing individuals to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Glycemic goals 
should be individualized, considering CKD severity, presence of macrovascular 
and microvascular complications, and life expectancy. A general hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) goal of approximately 7% may be appropriate in earlier stages of CKD, 
with more relaxed targets often appropriate in later stages. Use of sodium 
glucose cotransporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists (GLP-1RAs) meaningfully improves kidney and heart outcomes for patients 
with diabetes and CKD, irrespective of HbA1c targets, and are now part of 
guideline-directed medical therapy in this high-risk population. Delivery of 
optimal care for patients with diabetes and CKD will require collaboration 
across health care specialties and disciplines.

BACKGROUND: There has been little systematic research on the mortality impact of 
COVID-19 in the Native American population.
OBJECTIVE: We provide estimates of loss of life expectancy in 2020 and 2021 
relative to 2019 for the Native American population.
METHODS: We use data on age-specific all-cause mortality rates from CDC WONDER 
and the 2019 life table recently released by the National Vital Statistics 
System for Native Americans to calculate life tables for the Native American 
population in 2020 and 2021 and to obtain estimates of life expectancy 
reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The pandemic has set Native Americans further behind other major 
racial/ethnic groups in terms of life expectancy. The estimated loss in life 
expectancy at birth for Native Americans is 4.5 years in 2020 and 6.4 years in 
2021 relative to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the disproportionate share of deaths 
experienced by Native Americans: a loss in life expectancy at birth in 2020 that 
is more than three years above that for Whites and about 1.5 years above the 
losses for the Black and Latino populations. Despite a successful vaccination 
campaign among Native Americans, the estimated loss in life expectancy at birth 
in 2021 unexpectedly exceeds that in 2020.
CONTRIBUTION: The increased loss in life expectancy in 2021, despite higher 
vaccination rates than in other racial/ethnic groups, highlights the huge 
challenges faced by Native Americans in their efforts to control the deleterious 
consequences of the pandemic.

In Europe, the epidemiological transition has already taken place, while the 
demographic transition continues. Life expectancy at 65 is expanding for both 
women and men. The primary aim of this work is to identify the factors 
associated with life expectancy at 65 for women and men in Europe. The second 
aim is to confirm the influence of cultural factors on life expectancy. Finally, 
the link between spending on pensions, soil pollution, and life expectancy is 
also tested. Data for 31 European countries for the period 2004-2018 have been 
collected to estimate a linear panel data model. Life expectancy at 65 for women 
and men is the dependent variable. Independent variables are grouped into 
socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental conditions. The main result of this 
work is the importance of GDP per capita, and education and pension expenditure 
in explaining the heterogeneity of life expectancy at 65 across countries. Other 
significant results include the association of cultural characteristics, air 
pollution, and soil pollution with life expectancy. The design of policies for 
older adults and the improvement of their health and active life should consider 
not only differences in education but cultural characteristics, too. European 
directives that disregard people's cultural differences may not have the 
expected result.

Population ageing poses growing challenges to social security systems, in 
particular to public pension funds. The study analyses how Working Life 
Expectancy (WLE) and Healthy Working Life Expectancy (HWLE) in terms of three 
health indicators developed in Germany. Based on the German Socio-Economic Panel 
(GSOEP) from 2002 to 2018 (n = 211,141), time trends in labour force rates, 
mental and physical Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), self-rated health 
(SRH) and the respective combinations (health indicator*labour force) were 
analysed for all respondents aged 18-74. WLE and HWLE were calculated using the 
Sullivan method. WLE and HWLE in men and women at age 18 and 50 clearly 
increased over time. These increases in HWLE were found in terms of all three 
health indicators. This development was mainly driven by the clear increase of 
the labour force rates, since the shares of individuals with good and 
satisfactory SRH or average and good HRQoL remained largely stable over time. 
The results show that from a health perspective there have been potentials for 
increases in WLE during the past two decades and that increasingly more healthy 
life years are spent economically active. However, life years in the labour 
force but in poor health have increased, too. The absence of clear improvements 
in health emphasises the importance of current and future preventive measures to 
maintain health, especially among the middle-aged and older labour force.

This study investigated how individual trajectories of self-rated health (SRH) 
and working hours among older workers in Switzerland are interrelated and how 
this relationship varies based on occupation. We used data from the Swiss 
Household Panel to analyze the long-term trajectories of older workers measured 
in terms of working hours and SRH. The sample included more than 4000 workers 
aged 50 to 65(men)/64(women). We ran a bivariate response multilevel model for 
growth that allowed the examination of between- and within-individual changes 
over time. On a between-individual level, we found that the upper non-manual 
workers were the most heterogeneous occupational group in terms of working hours 
and the lower non-manual workers were the most heterogeneous occupational group 
in terms of health. Within all occupational groups, we found a significant 
relationship between the level of working hours and level of SRH. The 
individual-level statistics showed consistently strongest effects for manual 
workers. This result confirms our hypothesis that labor force participation in 
individuals of the manual occupational group is more sensitive to their health 
status. Our findings contribute to the debate regarding the importance of older 
workers' health in the context of the extension of working life.

We adopt a time series approach to investigate the historical relation between 
unemployment, life expectancy, and mortality rates. We fit 
Vector-autoregressions for the overall US population and for groups identified 
based on gender and race. We use our results to assess the long-run effects of 
the COVID-19 economic recession on mortality and life expectancy. We estimate 
the size of the COVID-19-related unemployment shock to be between 2 and 5 times 
larger than the typical unemployment shock, depending on race and gender, 
resulting in a significant increase in mortality rates and drop in life 
expectancy. We also predict that the shock will disproportionately affect 
African-Americans and women, over a short horizon, while the effects for white 
men will unfold over longer horizons. These figures translate in more than 0.8 
million additional deaths over the next 15 years.

The parahippocampal cingulum bundle (PHCB) interconnects regions known to be 
vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, including posteromedial 
cortex and medial temporal lobe. While AD-related pathology has been robustly 
associated with alterations in PHCB microstructure, specifically lower 
fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD), emerging evidence 
indicates that the reverse pattern is evident in younger adults at increased 
risk of AD. In one such study, Hodgetts et al. (2019) reported that healthy 
young adult carriers of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) ε4 allele - the strongest 
common genetic risk factor for AD - showed higher FA and lower MD in the PHCB 
but not the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). These results are consistent 
with proposals claiming that heightened neural activity and intrinsic 
connectivity play a significant role in increasing posteromedial cortex 
vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau spread beyond the medial temporal lobe. Given 
the implications for understanding AD risk, here we sought to replicate Hodgetts 
et al.'s finding in a larger sample (N = 128; 40 APOE ε4 carriers, 88 APOE ε4 
non-carriers) of young adults (age range = 19-33). Extending this work, we also 
conducted an exploratory analysis using a more advanced measure of white matter 
microstructure: hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA). Contrary to 
the original study, we did not observe higher FA or lower MD in the PHCB of APOE 
ε4 carriers relative to non-carriers. Bayes factors (BFs) further revealed 
moderate-to-strong evidence in support of these null findings. In addition, we 
observed no APOE ε4-related differences in PHCB HMOA. Our findings indicate that 
young adult APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers do not differ in PHCB 
microstructure, casting some doubt on the notion that early-life variation in 
PHCB tract microstructure might enhance vulnerability to amyloid-β accumulation 
and/or tau spread.

[Purpose] Arm choice is an unconscious action selection performed in daily life. 
Even if hemiparetic stroke patients can use their paretic arm, they compensate 
for their movements with their non-paretic arm, leading to decreased function of 
their paretic arm. Therefore, we need to encourage stroke patients to actively 
use their paretic arm. For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the 
process of selection of the left or right hand by patients. Here, we conducted a 
scoping review to summarize the findings of previous studies on factors and 
brain regions related to choice of arm. [Methods] We used PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, 
and the Cochrane Library to obtain research literature according to the PRISMA 
Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. [Results] Twenty-five of the 81 
articles obtained from the search met the defined criteria. Cost, success, and 
dominance were investigated as relevant factors for arm choice. We also 
extracted articles examining the relationship between the posterior parietal and 
premotor cortex activity and arm choice. [Conclusion] From these results, we 
considered ways to facilitate the use of the paretic arm, such as the use of 
virtual reality systems or exoskeletal robots to modulate the reaching cost and 
success rates, or non-invasive brain stimulation methods to modulate brain 
activity.

Global and regional trends of population aging spotlight major public health 
concerns. As one of the most common adverse prognostic factors, advanced age is 
associated with a remarkable incidence risk of many non-communicable diseases, 
affecting major organ systems of the human body. Age-dependent factors and 
molecular processes can change the nervous system's normal function and lead to 
neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress results from of a shift toward 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the equilibrium between ROS 
generation and the antioxidant defense system. Oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation caused by Amyloid-ß protein deposition in the human brain are 
the most likely pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Walnut extracts could 
reduce Amyloid-ß fibrillation and aggregation, indicating their beneficial 
effects on memory and cognition. Walnut can also improve movement disabilities 
in Parkinson's disease due to their antioxidant and neuroprotective effect by 
reducing ROS and nitric oxide (NO) generation and suppressing oxidative stress. 
It is noteworthy that Walnut compounds have potential antiproliferative effects 
on Glioblastoma (the most aggressive primary cerebral neoplasm). This effective 
therapeutic agent can stimulate apoptosis of glioma cells in response to 
oxidative stress, concurrent with preventing angiogenesis and migration of tumor 
cells, improving the quality of life and life expectancy of patients with 
glioblastoma. Antioxidant Phenolic compounds of the Walnut kernel could explain 
the significant anti-convulsion ability of Walnut to provide good prevention and 
treatment for epileptic seizures. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of 
Walnut oil could be beneficial in treating multiple sclerosis. In this study, we 
review the pharmaceutical properties of Walnut in age-related neurological 
disorders.

Well-Being Adjusted Health Expectancy: A New Summary Measure of Population 
Health.

We propose a new summary measure of population health (SMPH), the 
well-being-adjusted health expectancy (WAHE). WAHE belongs to a subgroup of 
health-adjusted life expectancy indicators and gives the number of life years 
equivalent to full health. WAHE combines health and mortality information into a 
single indicator with weights that quantify the reduction in well-being 
associated with decreased health. WAHE's advantage over other SMPHs lies in its 
ability to differentiate between the consequences of health limitations at 
various levels of severity and its transparent, simple valuation function. 
Following the guidelines of a Committee on Summary Measures of Population 
Health, we discuss WAHE's validity, universality, feasibility sensitivity and 
ensure its reproducibility. We evaluate WAHE's performance compared to life 
expectancy, the most commonly used indicators of health expectancy (HE) and 
disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALE) in an empirical application for 29 
European countries. Data on health and well-being are taken from the 2018 
EU-SILC, and the life tables are from Eurostat. DALE is taken from the database 
of the Global Burden of Disease Programme. WAHE's sensitivity to univariate and 
multivariate state specifications is studied using the three Minimum European 
Health Module health dimensions: chronic morbidity, limitations in activities of 
daily living, and self-rated health. The empirical tests of the indicators' 
correspondence reveal that WAHE has the strongest correlation with the other 
SMPHs. Moreover, WAHE estimates are in agreement with all other SMPHs. 
Additionally, WAHE and all other SMPHs form a group of reliable indicators for 
studying population health in European countries. Finally, WAHE estimates are 
robust, regardless of whether health is defined across one or multiple 
simultaneous dimensions of health. We conclude that WAHE is a useful and 
reliable indicator of population health and performs at least as well as other 
commonly used SMPHs.

Niche for stem cells profoundly influences their maintenance and fate during 
tissue homeostasis and pathological disorders; however, the underlying 
mechanisms and tissue-specific features remain poorly understood. Here, it is 
reported that fatty acid desaturation catabolized by stearoyl-coenzyme A 
desaturase 1 (SCD1) regulates hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and hair growth 
by maintaining the bulge, niche for HFSCs. Scd1 deletion in mice results in 
abnormal hair growth, an effect exerted directly on keratin K14+ keratinocytes 
rather than on HFSCs. Mechanistically, Scd1 deficiency impairs the level of 
integrin α6β4 complex and thus the assembly of hemidesmosomes (HDs). The 
disruption of HDs allows the aberrant activation of focal adhesion kinase and 
PI3K in K14+ keratinocytes and subsequently their differentiation and 
proliferation. The overgrowth of basal keratinocytes results in downward 
extension of the outer root sheath and interruption of bulge formation. Then, 
inhibition of PI3K signaling in Scd1-/- mice normalizes the bulge, HFSCs, and 
hair growth. Additionally, supplementation of oleic acid to Scd1-/- mice 
reestablishes HDs and the homeostasis of bulge niche, and restores hair growth. 
Thus, SCD1 is critical in regulating hair growth through stabilizing HDs in 
basal keratinocytes and thus sustaining bulge for HFSC residence and periodic 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) poses a substantial 
socioeconomic burden and is becoming the fastest growing driver of chronic liver 
disease, potentially accompanied by a poor prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to elucidate the global and regional epidemiologic changes in 
NAFLD during the past 30 years and explore the interconnected diseases.
METHODS: Data on NAFLD incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
The age-standardized incident rate (ASIR), age-standardized prevalent rate 
(ASPR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and age-standardized DALYs were 
calculated to eliminate the confounding effects of age when comparing the 
epidemiologic changes between different geographical regions. In addition, we 
also investigated the correlation between the NAFLD burden and the 
sociodemographic index (SDI). Finally, the associations of the 3 common 
comorbidities with NAFLD were determined.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence and prevalence of NAFLD both increased 
drastically during the past 3 decades (incidence: from 88,180 in 1990 to 172,330 
in 2019, prevalence: from 561,370,000 in 1990 to 1,235,700,000 in 2019), mainly 
affecting young adults who were aged from 15 to 49 years. The ASIR increased 
slightly from 1.94 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 2.08 per 100,000 population 
in 2019, while ASPR increased from 12,070 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 
15,020 per 100,000 population in 2019. In addition, the number of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to NAFLD increased significantly as well from 93,760 in 1990 
to 168,970 in 2019 and from 2,711,270 in 1990 to 4,417,280 in 2019, 
respectively. However, the ASDR and age-standardized DALYs presented decreasing 
trends with values of estimated annual percentage change equaling to -0.67 and 
-0.82, respectively (ASDR: from 2.39 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 2.09 per 
100,000 population in 2019; age-standardized DALYs: from 63.28 per 100,000 
population in 1990 to 53.33 per 100,000 population in 2019). Thereinto, the 
burden of death and DALYs dominated the patients with NAFLD who are older than 
50 years. Moreover, SDI appeared to have obvious negative associations with 
ASPR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs among 21 regions and 204 countries, 
although there is no marked association with ASIR. Finally, we found that the 
incidence and prevalence of NAFLD were positively related to those of diabetes 
mellitus type 2, stroke, and ischemic heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is leading to increasingly serious health challenges 
worldwide. The morbidity presented a clear shift toward the young populations, 
while the heavier burden of death and DALYs in NAFLD was observed in the aged 
populations and in regions with relatively low SDI. Comprehensive acquisition of 
the epidemiologic pattern for NAFLD and the identification of high-risk 
comorbidities may help policy makers and clinical physicians develop 
cost-effective prevention and control strategies, especially in countries with a 
high NAFLD burden.

Health results from the intricate interplay among genetic predisposition, 
socio-behavioral-environmental influences, and access to health care. The World 
Health Organization defines mental wellness as “a state of well-being in which 
the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses 
of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her 
community.”  In the United States, people are increasingly sedentary, consume a 
less nutritious diet, are more socially isolated, and experience more sleep-wake 
cycle abnormalities than previous generations. The consequence is our mental 
health, evidenced by major depressive disorder becoming the leading cause of 
disability worldwide.  Mental illness, in turn, is associated with a high 
prevalence of comorbid substance use, physical inactivity, and poor diet, all of 
which are also known contributors to poor physical health. Primary care 
physicians are the first point of medical contact for most psychiatric patients 
and continue to be the leading med management providers for most of these 
patients. Mental illness also complicates co-existing medical conditions, making 
them more challenging and expensive to manage. These factors, in combination, 
make mental health an essential issue for primary care physicians. In Australian 
populations, those with severe mental illness have a 10 to 20-year decrease in 
life expectancy compared to the general population. These patients are 2 to 3 
times more likely to have respiratory and cardiovascular disease, with up to 67% 
having metabolic syndrome. Mental health and affective symptoms play a critical 
role in choosing optimal health behaviors, which add to preventable chronic 
diseases over months and years. While medication and therapy are used as 
first-line treatments to treat the symptoms of mental illness, as the name 
indicates, Lifestyle Medicine can address patients’ habits that are modifiable 
risk factors. Lifestyle Medicine seeks to address the root causes of disease by 
helping individuals find and incorporate healthy habits that affect health and 
quality of life, with the explicit purpose of preventing, treating, and 
reversing chronic disease. Therefore, Lifestyle Medicine offers an approach to 
reducing the burden of physical and mental illness, which are intimately 
related.

INTRODUCTION: A 'learning healthcare system', based on electronic health records 
and other routinely collected healthcare data, would allow Real World Data (RWD) 
to be continuously fed into the system, ensuring that with every new patient 
treated, we know more overall about the practice of medicine. A judicious use of 
RWD would complement the traditional evidence from clinical research, for the 
benefit of all stakeholders involved in healthcare. Lack of data on disease 
epidemiology in Kazakhstan resonates with lower life expectancy and poorer 
health indicators compared to countries with analogous income per capita. Usage 
of primary data collection methods to fill these gaps require additional 
financial and human resources. Usage of big data, which is routinely collected 
though healthcare information systems, is considered as a competitive 
alternative in described circumstances.
OBJECTIVE: Development of the Unified National Electronic Healthcare System 
(UNEHS) in Kazakhstan allowed the creation of research databases to investigate 
epidemiology of numerous diseases. UNEHS research databases endorse extensive 
research activities due to a prospective follow-up, coverage of the whole 
Kazakhstani population and relatively lower expenses to conduct epidemiological 
studies. This review paper aims to introduce the content and descriptive data on 
research databases on population-based registries of UNEHS and to discuss 
opportunities and limitations of its usage.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: UNEHS databases include medical data on 36.4% of an 
adult population of Kazakhstan. Research databases presented in this paper 
contain critical variables that can be utilized for investigation of disease 
epidemiology, effectiveness of provided medical procedures and infectious 
disease epidemiology. A few examples accompany a detailed elaboration on the 
possibilities of research database utilization in epidemiological research.
CONCLUSION: Considering numerous advantages, the UNEHS research databases are 
expected to greatly contribute to healthcare in Kazakhstan by providing critical 
data on disease epidemiology. To warrant long-term usage and high research 
output several concerns and limitations should be addressed as well.

BACKGROUND: Severe asthma impacts quality of life (QoL), including dyspnea, 
sleep, and activity limitation. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, 
blocks the shared receptor component for interleukins-4 and -13, which are key 
and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. Phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE 
(NCT02528214) and LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSE open-label extension (NCT02134028) 
evaluated dupilumab 300 mg vs placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks (VENTURE) and 
dupilumab only for an additional 48 to 96 weeks (TRAVERSE) in patients with oral 
corticosteroid (OCS)-dependent severe asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To assess dupilumab's impact on Asthma QoL Questionnaire (AQLQ) items 
related to breathing symptoms, sleep, and activity limitation, and on OCS 
reduction.
METHODS: The proportion of patients with AQLQ scores of 6 or 7 for breathing 
symptoms-, sleeping-, and activity-related items in VENTURE and TRAVERSE, 
together with OCS dose reductions in VENTURE.
RESULTS: In VENTURE, significantly greater proportions of dupilumab- vs 
placebo-treated patients achieved scores of 6 or 7 by week 24 in breathing 
symptoms-related (42.7%-60.2% vs 22.4%-39.3%), sleeping-related (45.6%-65.0% vs 
27.1%-47.7%), and activity-related (44.7%-51.5% vs 22.4%-34.6%) AQLQ items. 
Improvements were maintained through TRAVERSE in the dupilumab/dupilumab group 
and increased to dupilumab treatment levels in the placebo/dupilumab group. 
Significant OCS dose reductions were observed in VENTURE; up to 90% and 60% of 
dupilumab-treated vs 65% and 41% of placebo-treated patients with AQLQ scores of 
6 or 7 in breathing symptoms-, sleeping-, and activity-related items achieved 
greater than or equal to 50% dose reduction and eliminated OCS at week 24, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe OCS-dependent asthma, dupilumab improved QoL 
related to breathing symptoms, sleep, and activity limitation, and reduced OCS 
use.

AIM: In India, more than 70% patients present as locally advanced head-and-neck 
cancers (LAHNC), with poor performance status and are suitable candidates for 
palliative radiotherapy (RT) aimed at symptom relief. This prospective study 
aims to compare two different short course hypo-fractionated RT regimens in 
patients of LAHNC at a regional cancer centre of north-west India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 70 patients of LAHNC were randomized to 
receive palliative RT in two groups of 35 each. Group A received 30 Gy/10# over 
2 weeks and Group B received 20 Gy/5# over 1 week. Baseline symptoms of pain, 
dysphagia, insomnia, dysphonia, bleeding, fungation, and dyspnea were assessed 
before the start of study. The first assessment for toxicities, subjective and 
objective response was done at the conclusion of RT and then after 4-6 weeks.
RESULTS: Out of total 70 patients, 71% were males and 29% were females with a 
median age of 54 years. The most common sites were oropharynx (39%) followed by 
larynx (24%), oral cavity (20%), and hypopharynx (17%). Nearly 60% of the 
patients in both groups presented in stage IV and 40% in stage III. At 
conclusion of RT and at 4-6 weeks follow-up, both groups showed similar results 
in terms of symptom palliation, objective response, and acute toxicities. Group 
B showed higher incidence of Grade III and above mucositis (P = 0.027). Median 
overall survival was found to be 5.9 months (range 1-15 months) in group A and 
6.1 months (range 1-18 months) in Group B.
CONCLUSION: Hypo-fractionated RT promises to effectively relieve symptoms in 
LAHNC and reduces the need of analgesics and hospital visits. Furthermore, a 
shorter overall treatment time is beneficial at high volume centers and is also 
welcomed by patients with shorter life expectancy.
