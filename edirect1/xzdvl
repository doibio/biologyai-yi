the shorter life expectancy of people with depression, yet no study has 
quantified their contribution. We quantify the contribution of alcohol-related 
deaths to the life-expectancy gap in depression in four European countries with 
differing levels of alcohol-related mortality.
METHODS: We used cohort data linking population registers with health-care and 
death records from Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Turin, Italy, in 1993-2007 
(210,412,097 person years, 3046,754 deaths). We identified psychiatric 
inpatients with depression from hospital discharge registers in Denmark, 
Finland, and Sweden and outpatients with antidepressant prescriptions from 
prescription registers in Finland and Turin. We assessed alcohol-related and 
non-alcohol-related deaths using both underlying and contributory causes of 
death, stratified by sex, age and depression status. We quantified the 
contribution of alcohol-related deaths by cause-of-death decomposition of the 
life-expectancy gap at age 25 between people with and without depression.
RESULTS: The gap in life expectancy was 13.1-18.6 years between people with and 
without inpatient treatment for depression and 6.7-9.1 years between those with 
and without antidepressant treatment. The contribution of alcohol-related deaths 
to the life-expectancy gap was larger in Denmark (33.6%) and Finland 
(18.1-30.5%) - i.e., countries with high overall alcohol-related mortality - 
than in Sweden (11.9%) and Turin (3.2%), and larger among men in all countries. 
The life-expectancy gap due to other than alcohol-related deaths varied little 
across countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol contributes heavily to the lower life expectancy in 
depression particularly among men and in countries with high overall 
alcohol-related mortality.

PURPOSE: Lung cancer accounts for the largest number of deaths among malignant 
tumors. Recently, more and more patients are concerned about their own life 
expectancy. CT examination is essential for the diagnosis of lung cancer. 
However, it is difficult to accurately predict the prognosis using CT images. In 
this study, we developed a method to predict the prognosis of lung cancer 
patients from CT images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a machine 
learning method.
METHODS: In this study, the CT images of 173 lung cancer patients were 
collected. First, we selected the slice with the largest tumor size in each case 
and extracted features using a CNN. Next, we performed feature selection using 
information gain and predicted alive or death by classifiers. An artificial 
neural network or Naïve Bayes was used as a classifier and alive and death were 
predicted at one-year intervals from one year to five years later.
RESULTS: We evaluated the prediction accuracy via the three-fold 
cross-validation method and found that the prediction accuracies were around 80% 
for all periods from 1 to 5 years. In the evaluation of the survival curve, the 
shape of the curve was close to the actual curve.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that feature extraction by a CNN and 
classification by the machine learning method may be effective in predicting the 
prognosis of lung cancer patients using CT images.

Effective management of gout includes the following: appropriate control of gout 
flares; lifestyle modifications; management of comorbidities; and long-term 
urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent subsequent gout flares, structural joint 
damage, and shortening of life expectancy. In addition to traditional treatments 
for gout, novel therapies have been introduced in recent years. Indeed, new 
recommendations for the management of gout have been proposed by various 
international societies. Although effective and safe medications to treat gout 
have been available, management of the disease has continued to be suboptimal, 
with poor patient adherence to ULT and failure to reach serum urate target. This 
review outlines recent progress in gout management, mainly based on the latest 
published guidelines, and specifically provides an update on efficient 
strategies for implementing treatment, efficacy and safety of specific 
medications for gout, and cardiovascular outcomes of ULT. In particular, we 
reviewed gout management approaches that can be applied to a Korean population.

OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of hearing loss in autoinflammatory disorders due to 
activation of the inflammasome remains incompletely understood. Previously no 
animals expressing mutant Nlrp3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 
3) survived to an age when hearing evaluation was possible due to embryonic 
lethality. We aimed to establish a novel mouse model that manifests quantifiable 
hearing loss with other syndromic features due to alteration of Nlrp3 and 
investigate the audiologic and histopathologic phenotype in the cochlea to 
clarify how the genetic alterations of NLRP3 could induce autoinflammatory 
hearing loss.
METHODS: To induce inner ear expression of the mutant Nlrp3, Nlrp3 D301NneoR 
mice were bred with Gfi1 Cre knock-in mice for conditional mutant Nlrp3 
activation in the cochlea and hematopoietic cells. Hearing thresholds were 
measured. Hematoxylin-eosin sections of the cochlea, brain, kidney, and liver 
were examined under light microscopy. Immunohistochemical analyses using 
polyclonal anti-NLRP3 antibodies on cochlear whole-mount preparations and frozen 
sections were performed.
RESULTS: We, for the first time in the literature, established a mouse model 
that manifests quantifiable hearing loss due to Nlrp3 alteration. ABR recordings 
of Nlrp3 D301NneoR/+; Gfi1 Cre/+ mice, albeit with limited life expectancy, 
exhibited severe to profound hearing loss at postnatal day 20 (P20). There was 
overall overexpression of mutant Nlrp3, and mutant Nlrp3 expression was noted in 
the spiral prominence, the outer sulcus region (Claudius cells and outer sulcus 
cells), the organ of Corti, the inner sulcus, and the spiral ganglion neurons in 
the cochlea. The hematoxylin-eosin sections of Nlrp3 D301NneoR/+; Gfi1 Cre/+ 
mice cochleae at P12 exhibited a disorganized organ of Corti between the outer 
hair cells/supporting Deiters' cells and basilar membrane compared with the 
normal phenotype mice, leading to a collapsed Nuel's space. This morphologic 
feature gradually returned to normal by P15. Varying degrees of inflammation 
with lymphocytic infiltrations were observed in the brain, kidney, and liver.
CONCLUSION: We report the first mutant Nlrp3 overexpression mouse model (Nlrp3 
D301NneoR/+; Gfi1 Cre/+) that shows obvious overexpression of Nlrp3 in the 
cochlea, a transient developmental lag of the cochlea, and severe to profound 
hearing loss. We expect that this mouse line, which models human 
autoinflammatory hearing loss, could provide a valuable tool to elucidate the 
underlying pathogenic mechanism of inflammasome activation-mediated hearing 
loss.

Hospitalized Women's Perspective on Willingness-to-Screen for Cancers in 
Relation to Life Expectancy.

Shubella J(1), Kauffman G(1), Khaliq W(1).

Baltimore, USA.

OBJECTIVE:  Life expectancy is an important tool for physicians and patients to 
determine when medical services for disease prevention should be rendered. Since 
patients' preference is an important predictor for cancer screening compliance, 
incorporating life expectancy with cancer screening preferences becomes 
essential. The purpose of the study is to explore the mean life expectancy 
duration that hospitalized women expect in order to undergo cancer screening 
tests.
METHODS:  A cross-sectional bedside survey including the contingent valuation 
method was used to assess the mean life expectancy among 475 cancer-free 
hospitalized women aged 50-75 years, which justified their willingness to 
undergo cancer screening tests. The probit and logistic regression models were 
used for the analysis in October 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 74% of women were willing to undergo cancer screening if the 
mean life expectancy was 24.3 months (SE = 12.8, p = 0.058). After adjustment 
for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, hospitalized women were willing to 
undergo cancer screening if the mean life expectancy was 26.6 months (SE = 13.3, 
p = 0.045). Race (African American and others vs Caucasians, OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 
1.43-3.81) and annual household income <$20,000 (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.02-2.86) 
were associated with the willingness to undergo cancer screening among 
hospitalized women.
CONCLUSION:  The study's findings suggest that hospitalized women value the 
prospect of cancer screening tests, given the mean life expectancy of 
approximately 27 months. Therefore, offering screening tests to nonadherent 
hospitalized women with a mean life expectancy of 2¼ years, especially to those 
at high risk for developing cancer, with low income, or women of color, may 
improve adherence to cancer screening recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is an alternative placental transfusion 
method for delayed umbilical cord clamping in routine obstetric practice, 
allowing prompt resuscitation of an infant. Thus, UCM has been adopted at some 
tertiary neonatal centers for preterm infants to enhance placental-to-fetal 
transfusion. It is not suggested for babies less than 28 wk of gestational age 
because it is associated with severe brain hemorrhage. For late preterm or term 
infants who do not require resuscitation, cord management is recommended to 
increase iron levels and prevent the development of iron deficiency anemia, 
which is associated with impaired motor development, behavioral problems, and 
cognitive delays. Concerns remain about whether UCM increases the incidence of 
intraventricular hemorrhage. However, there are very few reports of late preterm 
infants presenting with neonatal hemorrhage stroke (NHS) and severe coagulopathy 
after receiving UCM. Here, we report a case of a late preterm infant born at 34 
wk of gestation. She abruptly deteriorated, exhibiting signs and symptoms of NHS 
and severe coagulopathy after receiving UCM on the first day of life.
CASE SUMMARY: A female preterm infant born at 34 wk of gestation received UCM 
after birth. She was small for her gestational age and described as vigorous 
with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at one minute and five minutes of life, 
respectively. After hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit, she 
showed hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The baby was administered glucose 
and sodium bicarbonate infusions. Intramuscular vitamin K1 was also used to 
prevent vitamin K deficiency. The baby developed umbilical cord bleeding and 
gastric bleeding on day 1 of life; a physical examination showed bilateral 
conjunctival hemorrhage, and a blood test showed thrombocytopenia, prolonged 
prothrombin time, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, low 
fibrinogen, raised D-dimer levels and anemia. A subsequent cranial ultrasound 
and computed tomography scan showed a left parenchymal brain hemorrhage with 
extension into the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces. The patient was 
diagnosed with NHS in addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrate were given for 
coagulopathy. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions were provided for 
thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bolus of midazolam, intravenous calcium and 
phenobarbital sodium were administered to control seizures. The baby's clinical 
condition improved on day 5 of life, and the baby was hospitalized for 46 d and 
recovered well without seizure recurrence. Our case report suggests that preterm 
infants who receive UCM should undergo careful clinical assessment for 
intracranial hemorrhage, NHS and severe coagulopathy that may develop under 
certain circumstances. Supportive management, such as intensive care, FFP and 
blood transfusion, is recommended when the development of massive NHS and 
associated DIC is suspected.
CONCLUSION: Our case report suggests that for late preterm infants who are small 
for gestational age and who receive UCM for alternative placental transfusion, 
neonatal health care professionals should be cautious in assessing the 
development of NHS and severe coagulopathy. Neonatal health care professionals 
should also be more cautious in assessing the complications of late preterm 
infants after they receive UCM.

An Analysis of Life-Year Lost Due to COVID-19 - 34 Countries, December 
2019-March 2021.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC? The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic has caused severe health consequences. Though most COVID-19 deaths 
occurred among very old people, their life-year loss might be very large because 
of their life expectancy at that age.
WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? This study quantified how many years of life were 
lost due to COVID-19 in 34 countries. COVID-19 caused 9 to 21 years of life lost 
(YLL) per deceased patient. East Asia and Oceania had substantially lower per 
capita YLL than North America and Europe. Among all countries included, the 
United States had the greatest total YLL, Peru had the largest YLL per 100,000 
people, and Mexico had the largest YLL per 100,000 COVID-19 patients.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? The YLL quantification 
indicated that the vulnerable population, especially the elderly, should be 
protected under careful public health measures to reduce their YLL. It also 
implied that it might be too early to lift anti-epidemic restrictions now, since 
the extreme disproportionate consequences (total and per-capita YLL) in 
different countries underscored the scrutinization over the variation in disease 
control strategies to optimize future disease control and prevention.

Measuring the Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mortality: Review and Prospect - 
China, 2021.

Current progress in measuring the effect of the pandemic on mortality is 
limited. Few studies have comprehensively and systematically elucidated the 
mechanism through which the pandemic affects mortality and what indicators are 
valid to capture such an effect. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis 
regarding the multifaceted effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 
mortality and its measurements [i.e., confirmed deaths per million people 
(CDPMP), case fatality rate (CFR), infection fatality risk (IFR), excess 
mortality P-score (EMPS), and life expectancy (LE)]. It was revealed that both 
data collection efforts and measurements on mortality due to COVID-19 were far 
from perfect and discussed the importance of accurate, prompt, and accessible 
data by any government over the course of fighting against the COVID-19 
pandemic. It is believed that the biggest challenge in measuring the effect of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality lies not in the construction of indicators at 
the academic level, but in the collection of data at the practical level. Thus, 
it is suggested to take measures to better monitor the development of the 
pandemic and mitigate the increasing burdens borne by the public health systems 
by improving the tracking system of mortality, standardizing the diagnosis of 
COVID-19's deaths, and disclosing mortality data.

Pace and shape of senescence in three species of duckweed.

Paiha AP(1), Laird RA(1).

Author information:

Canada.

Senescence is progressive bodily deterioration associated with declines in 
survival and fecundity in older age classes. There is great diversity in 
patterns of senescence across species, but these patterns can be difficult to 
compare formally due to variation in the absolute time scales in which species 
live and die: members of some species live for a matter of days, others for 
millennia. To address this issue, the "pace-shape" approach was developed to 
decouple absolute time from analyses and instead standardize life history traits 
in terms of average life expectancy, facilitating intra- and interspecific 
comparisons. Here, we use this approach to distinguish the generic form of 
demographic trajectories (shape) from the time scale on which the trajectories 
occurred (pace) in three species of tiny, free-floating aquatic plants known as 
duckweeds (Lemna gibba L., L. minor L., and L. turionifera Landolt), which have 
mean lifespans of less than a month under typical lab conditions, and exhibit 
age-related declines in survivorship and reproduction. Using a randomized block 
design in which we tracked a final total of 430 individuals, we report 
differences in pace and shape among the three species. Specifically, the 
largest, least-fecund, and typically longest-lived species, L. gibba, tended to 
exhibit more rapid decreases in time-standardized survivorship and fecundity 
compared with the other two species. This study emphasizes variation in aging 
patterns that can be found among plant species, including those in the same 
genus, and provides further validation for the utility of applying the pace and 
shape approach in interspecific comparisons.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of home-based cardiac rehabilitation and 
traditional outpatient rehabilitation in stage II after percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: From September 2019 to March 2020, 80 AMI patients in Cangzhou Central 
Hospital were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: the control group or 
the observation group, 40 cases in each group. The control group received 
old-fashioned outpatient rehabilitation treatment, and the study group received 
long-distance family rehabilitation nursing intervention. The blood pressure, 
examination results, compliance, satisfaction evaluation, incidence of cardiac 
events, heart rate, quality of life score, and 6-minute walking test were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There were no deaths in both groups. There were significant differences 
in heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unplanned readmission rate, walking 
compliance, and 6-minute walking test at 6 months after discharge (P < 0.05). 
There were substantial variances in left ventricular discharge portion, 
low-density lipoprotein, medication compliance, satisfaction, and quality of 
life (P < 0.05); there was substantial inconsistency in the 6-minute walking 
test concerning the two groups afterwards discharge for 3 months (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Home rehabilitation is a new home cardiac rehabilitation model with 
high efficiency, convenience, and whole process monitoring and barrier-free 
follow-up management. It can effectively improve the cardiac function, workout 
patience and worth of life expectancy of victims with AMI, improve their 
self-management awareness and rehabilitation compliance, reduce the risk of 
cardiac events, and have a positive impact on the prognosis and rehabilitation 
of patients with AMI.

Background The deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry is defined as 
fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and is a common phenomenon among living organisms. 
This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the environmental pressures 
experienced during development and, therefore, the FA represents an epigenetic 
measure of the environmental stress, which affects all living beings from 
conception, progressively affecting all aspects of life. Rinaldi and Fontani 
hypothesized that the FA morpho-functional changes are originated by an adaptive 
motor behavior determined by functional alterations in the cerebellum and neural 
circuits, not caused by a lesion, but induced by the experienced environmental 
stress. They identified in the asymmetric activation of symmetrical muscle 
groups, detectable even in healthy subjects, the expression of the dysfunctional 
adaptation state of the subject and named this clinical semeiotic phenomenon 
functional dysmetria (FD). On these premises, they developed the radio electric 
asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology, a neuromodulation technology aimed at 
optimizing the best neuro-psycho-motor strategies in relation to environmental 
interaction. Neuro postural optimization (NPO) is a neurobiological stimulation 
treatment administered with the REAC technology and it has been specifically 
studied to treat the state of dysfunctional adaptation that is revealed through 
the presence of FD. Aim The purpose of this study was to verify whether a single 
administration of the REAC NPO treatment can trigger the improvement of the 
capacity of stress management and the quality of life in a population of 
children housed in a group home in Macapá, Brazil. Materials and methods The 
sample of this study consisted of nine children (six boys and three girls) in 
the age group of 6-11 years, which represented the totality of the children 
present in the structure. The children was investigated for the assessment of 
the presence of functional dysmetria and with the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory TM 4.0 (PedsQL) before and one week after the administration of the 
REAC NPO. Results The stable disappearance of FD was found in all children at 
follow-up. In addition, improvements were found in stress management and quality 
of life, in the physical, emotional, social, and scholastic aspects evaluated 
with PedsQL. Conclusions It was seen that the REAC NPO neurobiological 
modulation treatment induced the stable disappearance of FD and triggered the 
initial improvement of neurophysical aspects also in a population of children 
housed in a group home in the Amazon region of Macapá, Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel (a 
CAR T-cell therapy), versus blinatumomab, for the treatment of pediatric and 
young adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R 
ALL) in the Irish healthcare setting. The value of conducting further research, 
to investigate the value of uncertainty associated with the decision problem, is 
assessed by means of expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and partial 
EVPI (EVPPI) analyses.
METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model was developed. A short-term 
decision tree partitioned patients in the tisagenlecleucel arm according to 
infusion status. Survival was extrapolated to 60 months; general population 
mortality with a standardized mortality ratio was then applied. Estimated EVPI 
and EVPPI were scaled up to population according to the incidence of the 
decision.
RESULTS: At list prices, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was EUR 73,086 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (incremental costs EUR 156,928; 
incremental QALYs 2.15). The probability of cost-effectiveness, at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 45,000 per QALY, was 16 percent. At this 
threshold, population EVPI was EUR 314,455; population EVPPI was below EUR 
100,000 for each parameter category.
CONCLUSIONS: Tisagenlecleucel is not cost effective, versus blinatumomab, for 
the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with R/R ALL in Ireland (at 
list prices). Further research to decrease decision (parameter) uncertainty, at 
the defined willingness-to-pay threshold, may not be of value. However, there is 
a high degree of uncertainty underpinning the analysis, which may not be 
captured by EVPI analysis.

A Long-Term Study of the Safety and Efficacy of a Nutraceutical Supplement for 
Promoting Hair Growth in Perimenopausal, Menopausal, and Postmenopausal Women.

Ablon G, Kogan S, Raymond I.

The prevalence of female hair loss and hair thinning increases with advancing 
age and is most common among post-menopausal women. Recent statistics show that 
by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. A previous 
publication detailing the results of the 6-month randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase of this study demonstrated the ability of a 
nutraceutical supplement to significantly improve hair growth and shedding 
compared to placebo. Here, we present results from a subsequent 6-month, 
open-label extension phase assessing the continued safety and efficacy of this 
nutraceutical for promoting and improving hair growth and evaluate potential 
long-term benefits on quality of life and menopausal symptoms. After a total of 
12 months with the active nutraceutical, subjects had progressive improvements 
in hair growth, quality, and shedding. Quality of life measures and menopausal 
symptoms also improved over the duration of the study. When transitioned to 
daily intake of the supplement, subjects previously treated with placebo 
achieved significant increases in all hair counts, a significant decrease in 
shedding, and significant improvement in blinded investigator global hair growth 
and quality assessments. The results of this long-term study demonstrate that 
continued use of a novel nutraceutical provides significant incremental 
improvement over the beneficial effects achieved during the initial 6-month 
randomized, placebo-controlled phase. Continued use may provide ongoing 
improvements in hair growth and exert a positive effect on secondary symptoms of 
menopause, and quality of life in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal 
women with selfperceived thinning hair (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT04048031). J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(7):776-783. doi:10.36849/JDD.6912.

With increasing life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 
gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease have been increasingly brought 
into focus. This was a systematic review of the PubMed database and ongoing 
phase III clinical trials that aimed to summarize recent (published after June 1 
2016) studies reporting the effects of nutritional interventions on 
anthropometric measures (weight, height, and body mass index) in patients with 
CF. Two ongoing trials and 40 published studies (18 interventional and 22 
observational) were identified. Key results supported the benefits of 
comprehensive, individualized nutritional plans, high-fat, high-calorie diet 
including high-quality carbohydrates, and enteric tube feeding (albeit the 
latter was derived from observational studies only). In contrast, the 
supplementation of probiotics, lipids, docosahexaenoic, glutathione, or 
antioxidant-enriched multivitamin appeared to have little effect on 
anthropometric measures.

Ovarian aging occurs approximately 10 years prior to the natural age-associated 
functional decline of other organ systems. With the increase of life expectancy 
worldwide, ovarian aging has gradually become a key health problem among women. 
Therefore, understanding the causes and molecular mechanisms of ovarian aging is 
very essential for the inhibition of age-related diseases and the promotion of 
health and longevity in women. Recently, studies have revealed an association 
between adipose tissue (AT) and ovarian aging. Alterations in the function and 
quantity of AT have profound consequences on ovarian function because AT is 
central for follicular development, lipid metabolism, and hormonal regulation. 
Moreover, the interplay between AT and the ovary is bidirectional, with 
ovary-derived signals directly affecting AT biology. In this review, we 
summarize the current knowledge of the complex molecular mechanisms controlling 
the crosstalk between the AT and ovarian aging, and further discuss how 
therapeutic targeting of the AT can delay ovarian aging.

To study the effects of dietary methionine on growth performance, immunity, 
antioxidant capacity, protein metabolism, inflammatory response and apoptosis 
factors in Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis). Five diets with different 
methionine levels (0.63%, 0.85%, 1.06%, 1.25% and 1.47%) were fed to E. sinensis 
for 8 weeks. Results showed that in the 1.25% Met group, both growth performance 
and feed utilization were significantly increased. The crude protein content of 
crab muscle in the 1.06% and 1.25% Met groups was significantly higher than that 
in the control group. The immune and antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as 
gene expression levels of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor 1 (ALF1), Crustin-1, 
prophenoloxidase (proPO), cap 'n' collar isoform C (CncC) in 1.25% Met group 
were significantly higher than other groups. The activities of adenosine 
deaminase (ADA) and glutamate transaminase (GPT) in serum decreased first and 
then increased with the increase of methionine content, while the changes of ADA 
and GPT in hepatopancreas increased first and then decreased. 1.25% Met group 
exhibited significantly increased levels of GOT, GPT, and ADA compared to the 
control group. 1.25% Met diet group significantly up-regulated protein synthesis 
and anti-apoptotic factors, and significantly down-regulated inflammatory and 
pro-apoptotic factors in hepatopancreas. At 1.25% in the diet, methionine was 
found to boost E. sinensis growth, muscle protein deposition and immunity, as 
well as its antioxidant capacity. Combined with the above results, based on the 
expression of factors involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling 
pathway, it is proved that methionine can not only promote protein metabolism, 
improve feed utilization, but also alleviate the inflammatory response and 
apoptosis caused by oxidative stress in the body.

Prostate cancer is a common clinical disease in men. It is known that prostate 
cancer ranks 3rd in the incidence of malignant tumors of the male genitourinary 
system in China, which is able to evaluate the riskiness of life expectancy of 
male patients. Therefore, we investigated the expression of CD133, recombinant 
human kallikrein 3 (Klk3), grainy head like 2 (grhl2) in prostate cancer, and 
correlation with tumor characteristics in the present study. A total of 167 
prostate cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from 
February 2017 to April 2021 were selected. Their cancer and adjacent tissues 
were resected, and CD133 was detected by double staining using 
immunohistochemistry, Klk3 and grhl2 were detected by RT-PCR analysis, and 
CD133, Klk3 were analyzed by Pearson's method in different clinical stages, 
Gleason grade Correlation of grhl2 with tumor characteristics. The expression of 
CD133, KLK3, and GRHL2 in cancer tissue was increased compared with adjacent 
tissue (P < 0.05). The expression of CD133, KLK3, and GRHL2 increased with the 
aggravation of the clinical stage and Gleason grade (P < 0.05). CD133, KLK3, and 
GRHL2 showed a positive correlation in prostate cancer. The Pearson method found 
a positive correlation between CD133, KLK3, GRHL2 and clinical stage, Gleason 
grade, and lymph node metastasis. In general, high CD133, Klk3, and grhl2 
expression was observed in prostate cancer and increased with the disease. They 
presented a positive correlation in prostate cancer presence, and these three 
gene products correlated with tumor characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Despite treatment with statins, dyslipidaemia patients with elevated 
cholesterol- and triglyceride-levels remain at high residual risk for major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). New lipid-lowering drugs must prevent the 
occurrence of MACE and exhibit cost-effectiveness for their successful adoption 
to clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of icosapent ethyl, fenofibrate, 
ezetimibe, evolocumab, and alirocumab in combination with statins compared to 
statin monotherapy for cardiovascular prevention from the perspective of UK's 
National Health Service.
METHODS: A Markov model simulated the progression of cardiovascular disease and 
MACE, including myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, and coronary 
revascularisation, in dyslipidaemia patients. The model was populated with 
cardiovascular outcome trial data for each drug. Cost and utility data were 
extracted from peer-reviewed literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) is reported per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained in 2021 
Great Britain Pounds (£).
RESULTS: For primary cardiovascular prevention, icosapent ethyl increased QALYs 
by 0.79 and costs by £15,421 compared to statin monotherapy (ICER = 
£19,485/QALY). Fenofibrate yielded 0.62 additional QALYs at cost-savings of 
- £6127 (ICER = - £9932/QALY). For secondary prevention, the omega-3 fatty acid 
icosapent ethyl extended QALYs by 0.98 at costs of £12,981 compared to statin 
monotherapy (ICER = £13,285/QALY). Fenofibrate added 0.85 QALYs whilst saving 
- £637 (ICER = - £7472/QALY). Ezetimibe increased QALYs by 0.60 at cost 
reductions of - £2529 (ICER = - £4231/QALY). PCSK9 inhibitors provided QALYs of 
0.53 and 0.86 at costs of £45,279 and £46,375 for evolocumab (ICER = 
£85,193/QALY) and alirocumab (ICER = £54,211/QALY), respectively. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £25,000/QALY, there is a probability of 100% for 
icosapent ethyl (98% in primary prevention) and 0% for PCSK9 inhibitors to be 
cost effective in secondary prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: Icosapent ethyl is cost effective for primary and secondary 
cardiovascular prevention at an annual price of £2064 in the UK. For PCSK9 
inhibitors, price discounts or prescription restrictions are necessary to 
achieve cost effectiveness.

Beyond COP26: can income level moderate fossil fuels, carbon emissions, and 
human capital for healthy life expectancy in Africa?

The growing concerns on the need to moderate the unceasing surge in global 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions believed to be detrimental to the environment and 
wellbeing of the human race have generated concerted efforts from governments 
and policymakers worldwide. Among many other factors, fossil fuels which remain 
the most consumed energy resource have been identified as the primary culprit to 
demeaning life expectancy. To this end, this study probes how income mediates 
between fossil fuels and carbon emissions to promote life expectancy in selected 
oil-abundant African economies from 1980 to 2019. The roles of human capital 
through investment in education are considered in the current inquiry. The 
empirical evidence is anchored on second-generation tests comprising 
cross-sectional dependence, slope homogeneity, and Westerlund cointegration 
tests. The empirical model is estimated based on advanced panel techniques 
comprising cross-sectional dependence autoregressive distributed lag model, 
common correlated effects mean group, augmented mean group, and quantile 
regression. Findings from the study reveal that fossil fuels and carbon 
emissions reduce life expectancy. Besides, income level promotes healthy life 
expectancy while equally subduing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on it. 
Additionally, the life-improving roles of human capital are empirically 
confirmed. Based on the findings, withdrawing the subsidies on fossil fuels and 
making aggregate income inclusive are among the key policies formulated.

In recent years, the medical field had significantly progressed to a greater 
extent which was evidenced with increased life expectancy and decreased 
mortality rate. Due to the growth of medical field, numerous communicable 
diseases are prevented and eradicated, whereas the non-communicable disease 
incidence has been increased globally. One such non-communicable disease which 
threatens the global population is stroke. Stroke tends to be the second leading 
cause of death and disability in older population. In lower- and middle-income 
countries, increased incidence rate of stroke was also evidenced in younger 
population which is alarming. Lifestyle changes, poor physical activity, stress, 
consumption of alcohol, oral contraception, and smoking tend to be the causative 
agents of stroke. Since thrombus formation is the major pathology of stroke, 
drugs were targeted to thrombolysis. Currently thrombolytic, antiplatelet, and 
anticoagulant therapies were given for the stroke patients. But the recovery 
rate of stroke patients with available drugs is very slow. Hence, it is a need 
of today to discover a drug with increased recovery rate and decreased or nil 
side effects. Phytochemicals are the best options to treat such non-communicable 
chronic diseases. Visnagin is one such compound which is used to regulate blood 
pressure, treat kidney stones, tumors of bile duct, renal colic, and whooping 
cough. It possesses anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective 
properties; it was also proven to treat epileptic seizures. In this study, the 
anti-ischemic effect of a furanochrome visnagin was assessed in in vivo rat 
model. Middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion was induced in healthy male Sprague 
Dawley rats and treated with different concentrations of visnagin. The 
neuroprotective effect of visnagin against cerebral ischemia-induced rats was 
assessed by analyzing the neurological score, brain edema, infract volume, and 
Evans blue leakage. The anti-inflammatory property of visnagin was assessed by 
quantifying proinflammatory cytokines in serum and brain tissues of cerebral 
ischemia-induced rats. Prostaglandin E-2, COX-2, and NFκ-β were estimated to 
assess the anti-ischemic effect of visnagin. Histopathological analysis with H&E 
staining was performed to confirm the neuroprotective effect of visnagin against 
cerebral ischemia. Our results authentically confirm that visnagin has prevented 
the inflammation in brain region of cerebral ischemia-induced rats. The 
neurological scoring and the quantification of PGE-2, COX-2, and NFκ-β prove the 
anti-ischemic effect of visnagin. Furthermore, the histopathological analysis of 
hippocampal region provides evidence to the neuroprotective effect of visnagin 
against cerebral ischemia. Overall, our study confirms visnagin as a potent 
alternative drug to treat stroke.
