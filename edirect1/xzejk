this study, we resequenced the genomes of NIH normal mice and NIH hairless mice 
and obtained 3,575,560 high-quality, plausible SNP loci and 995,475 InDels. The 
Euclidean distance algorithm was used to assess the association of SNP loci with 
the hairless phenotype, at a threshold of 0.62. Two regions of chromosome 18 
having the highest association with the phenotype contained 345 genes with a 
total length of 13.98 Mb. The same algorithm was used to assess the association 
of InDels with the hairless phenotype at a threshold of 0.54 and revealed a 
region of 25.45 Mb in length, containing 518 genes. The mutation candidate gene 
Lama3 (NM_010680.2: c.652C>T; NP_034810.1: p. Arg217Cys) was selected based on 
the results of functional gene analysis and mutation prediction screening. Lama3 
(R217C) mutant mice were further constructed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and 
the relationship between Lama3 point mutations and the hairless phenotype were 
clarified by phenotypic observation. The results showed that male Lama3 point 
mutation mice started to lose hair on the 80th day after birth, and the hair 
loss area gradually expanded over time. H&E staining of skin sections showed 
that the point mutation mice had increased sebaceous glands in the dermis and 
missing hair follicle structure (i.e., typical symptoms of androgenetic 
alopecia). This study is a good extension of the current body of knowledge about 
the function of Lama3, and the constructed Lama3 (R217C) mutant mice may be a 
good animal model for studying androgenetic alopecia.

The increasing rate of obesity and life expectancy will lead to increasing 
numbers of bariatric procedures in the elderly. We aim to report the early 
(≤ 30 days) adverse events of One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) in this 
patient population. Assuta Bariatric Centers in Israel. Retrospective review of 
perioperative OAGB outcomes between elderly group (≥ 65 years) and non-elderly 
group (18-64 years) at high-volume bariatric centers between January 
2017-December 2021. Operative time, length of stay (LOS), and overall ≤ 30 days 
complication rates, as ranked by the Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) were 
compared. There were 6618 patients (non-elderly group) and 104 (elderly group) 
who underwent OAGB. Gender and preoperative BMI were comparable between the two 
age groups. The elderly group had significantly higher rate of ischemic heart 
disease and chronic renal failure. The number of patients with LOS ≥ 3 days was 
significantly higher in the elderly group [19.4% (n = 20) vs. 6.6% (n = 331), 
respectively; p < 0.001]. The total early adverse events were higher in the 
elderly group with no statistical significance [7.7% (n = 8) vs. 3.8% (n = 250), 
respectively; p = 0.062]. The rate of minor and major adverse events and 
reoperation rate was comparable between the two groups. The rate of readmissions 
was significantly higher in the elderly group 5.8% (n = 6) vs. 1.9% (n = 124), 
respectively p = 0.015. There was 0.06% mortality (n = 2) in the non-elderly 
group. OAGB is a relatively safe metabolic and bariatric surgery for elderly 
obese patients with early (≤ 30 days) morbidity rates similar to the non-elderly 
population.

OBJECTIVE: The data provided herein represent the whole-genome sequencing data 
associated with three sheep breeds of Iranian native breeds. Sheep are the first 
domesticated animals that, during the long path of the evolution process, have 
created gene variants with desirable phenotypic effects, so they can be suitable 
models for biomedical research. In addition, sheep have a vital role in 
providing protein to a notable part of the human population around the world.
DATA DESCRIPTION: Ten blood samples were taken from three Iranian native sheep 
breeds, the Zel, Karakul, and Kermani kinds. Blood samples genomes were 
extracted using the salting-out technique. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform 
was used to carry out sequencing of the whole genome in a laboratory in China. 
All sequence information is available through the NCBI database in the sequence 
read archive (SRA) format under the accession number PRJNA904537. The dataset 
presented here can provide a useful resource for genome analysis of livestock 
breeds adapted to hot and dry regions.

The correct alignment of the knee joint is considered to be one of the most 
influential factors in determining the long-term prognosis after total knee 
arthroplasty(TKA). In order to achieve the correct alignment goal, many 
different alignment concepts and surgical techniques have been established. For 
example, mechanical alignment(MA), kinematic alignment(KA) and functional 
alignment(FA) have their own characteristics. MA focuses on achieving neutral 
alignment of the limbs, parallel and equal bone gaps during stretching and 
flexion. KA aims to restore the patient 's natural joint line, make the joint 
level and angle normal and improve the physiological soft tissue balance, and 
strive to reproduce the normal knee function;among them, functional 
alignment(FA) developed with robot-assisted surgery technology is a relatively 
new alignment concept. It not only considers the alignment of the body, but also 
aims to achieve flexion and extension balance, while respecting the native soft 
tissue capsule. It not only restores the plane and slope of the in situ joint 
line accurately during the operation, but also takes into account the balance of 
soft tissue, which is a better alignment method. Therefore, it is of great 
significance to correctly construct the lower limb force line of patients, which 
is helpful to restore knee joint function, relieve pain symptoms and prolong the 
service life of prosthesi. However, compared with traditional TKA, the operation 
time of robot-assisted FA-TKA is prolonged, which means that the probability of 
postoperative infection will be greater. At present, most studies of FA 
technology report short-term results, and the long-term efficacy of patients is 
not clear. Therefore, long-term research results are needed to support the 
application of this technology. Therefore, the author makes a review on the 
research status of functional alignment.

A, Marquez E, D'Andrea D, Franz C, Pichika R, Dwinell MB, Jayabalan P, Lieber 
RL.

BACKGROUND: Progressive functional decline is a key element of cancer-associated 
cachexia. No therapies have successfully translated to the clinic due to an 
inability to measure and improve physical function in cachectic patients. Major 
barriers to translating pre-clinical therapies to the clinic include lack of 
cancer models that accurately mimic functional decline and use of non-specific 
outcome measures of function, like grip strength. New approaches are needed to 
investigate cachexia-related function at both the basic and clinical science 
levels.
METHODS: Survival extension studies were performed by testing multiple cell 
lines, dilutions, and vehicle-types in orthotopic implantation of K-ras 
LSL.G12D/+ ; Trp53 R172H/+ ; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) derived cells. 128 animals in this 
new model were then assessed for muscle wasting, inflammation, and functional 
decline using a battery of biochemical, physiologic, and behavioral techniques. 
In parallel, we analyzed a 156-subject cohort of cancer patients with a range of 
cachexia severity, and who required rehabilitation, to determine the 
relationship between gait speed via six-minute walk test (6MWT), grip strength 
(hGS), and functional independence measures (FIM). Cachectic patients were 
identified using the Weight Loss Grading Scale (WLGS), Fearon consensus 
criteria, and the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI).
RESULTS: Using a 100-cell dose of DT10022 KPC cells, we extended the survival of 
the KPC orthotopic model to 8-9 weeks post-implantation compared to higher doses 
used (p<0.001). In this Low-dose Orthotopic (LO) model, both progressive 
skeletal and cardiac muscle wasting were detected in parallel to systemic 
inflammation; skeletal muscle atrophy at the fiber level was detected as early 
as 3 weeks post-implantation compared to controls (p<0.001). Gait speed in LO 
animals declined as early 2 week post-implantation whereas grip strength change 
was a late event and related to end of life. Principle component analysis (PCA) 
revealed distinct cachectic and non-cachectic animal populations, which we 
leveraged to show that gait speed decline was specific to cachexia (p<0.01) 
while grip strength decline was not (p=0.19). These data paralleled our 
observations in cancer patients with cachexia who required rehabilitation. In 
cachectic patients (identified by WLGS, Fearon criteria, or PNI, change in 6MWT 
correlated with motor FIM score changes while hGS did not (r 2 =0.18, p<0.001). 
This relationship between 6MWT and FIM in cachectic patients was further 
confirmed through multivariate regression (r 2 =0.30, p<0.001) controlling for 
age and cancer burden.
CONCLUSION: Outcome measures linked to gait are better associated with cachexia 
related function and preferred for future pre-clinical and clinical cachexia 
studies.

plaque psoriasis: A novel topical therapy targeting the aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor.

Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, immunemediated skin disease characterized by 
scaly, erythematous, pruritic plaques. The effects of psoriasis are often 
debilitating and stigmatizing, significantly impacting patients' physical and 
psychological well-being and quality of life. Current guideline-recommended 
psoriasis therapies (topicals, oral systemics, and biologics) have substantial 
limitations that include overall efficacy, safety, tolerability, sites of 
application, disease severity, and duration and extent of body surface area 
treated. Due to these limitations, psoriasis treatment regimens often require 
combination therapy, especially for moderate to severe disease, leading to 
increased treatment burden. Psoriasis is also associated with increased indirect 
costs (eg, reduced work productivity), leading to greater total costs 
expenditures. Thus, more effective, safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective 
therapeutic options are needed. Tapinarof cream 1% once daily is a 
first-in-class, nonsteroidal, topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist approved 
by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2022 for the treatment of plaque 
psoriasis in adults. Tapinarof cream has been evaluated in plaque psoriasis, 
including 2 pivotal phase 3 trials (NCT03956355 and NCT03983980) and a long-term 
extension trial (NCT04053387). These trials demonstrated high rates of complete 
skin clearance with tapinarof cream, durable effects while on treatment (a lack 
of tachyphylaxis for up to 52 weeks), an approximately 4-month remittive effect 
off therapy after achieving complete clearance and stopping treatment (ie, 
duration during which psoriasis does not recur off therapy), and no rebound 
effects after cessation of therapy. According to the US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved prescribing information, tapinarof may be used to treat 
plaque psoriasis of any severity and in any location, has no restrictions on 
duration of use or extent of total body surface area treated, and has no 
contraindications, warnings, precautions, or drug-drug interactions. Tapinarof 
cream is thus an efficacious, well-tolerated, steroid-free topical option that 
addresses many of the limitations of current recommended therapies. Here we 
review current knowledge on the physical, psychological, and financial burdens 
of plaque psoriasis and identify how the clinical profile of tapinarof cream can 
address key treatment gaps important in the management of plaque psoriasis and 
patient quality of life. In this article, we aim to assist pharmacists and other 
managed care practitioners by providing an evidence-based overview of tapinarof 
cream to support patient-centric decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Innovative restructuring of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery 
remains critical to reduce barriers and improve access to diverse populations. 
Destination Cardiac Rehab is a novel virtual world technology-based CR program 
delivered through the virtual world platform, Second Life, which previously 
demonstrated high acceptability as an extension of traditional center-based CR. 
This study aims to evaluate efficacy and adherence of the virtual world-based CR 
program compared with center-based CR within a community-informed, 
implementation science framework.
METHODS: Using a noninferiority, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation, 
randomized controlled trial, 150 patients with an eligible cardiovascular event 
will be recruited from 6 geographically diverse CR centers across the United 
States. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the 12-week Destination 
Cardiac Rehab or the center-based CR control groups. The primary efficacy 
outcome is a composite cardiovascular health score based on the American Heart 
Association Life's Essential 8 at 3 and 6 months. Adherence outcomes include CR 
session attendance and participation in exercise sessions. A diverse 
patient/caregiver/stakeholder advisory board was assembled to guide recruitment, 
implementation, and dissemination plans and to contextualize study findings. The 
institutional review board-approved randomized controlled trial will enroll and 
randomize patients to the intervention (or control group) in 3 consecutive 
waves/year over 3 years. The results will be published at data collection and 
analyses completion.
CONCLUSIONS: The Destination Cardiac Rehab randomized controlled trial tests an 
innovative and potentially scalable model to enhance CR participation and 
advance health equity. Our findings will inform the use of effective virtual CR 
programs to expand equitable access to diverse patient populations.

Light-harvesting (LH) complexes in photosynthetic organisms absorb photons 
within limited wavelength ranges over a broad solar spectrum. Extension of the 
LH wavelength has been realized by attaching artificial fluorophores to LH 
complexes (biohybrid LH complexes) for complementing the limited-wavelength 
regions. However, how efficiently such fluorophores in biohybrid LH complexes 
function to drive the photocatalytic reaction center (RC) has not been 
quantitatively evaluated, specifically in comparison with native LH antenna 
complexes. In this study, we prepared various biohybrid LH1-RC complexes (from 
Rhodopseudomonas palustris), to quantitatively evaluate the LH activity of the 
attached external chromophores through a photocurrent generation reaction by 
LH1-RC on an electrode. For a direct comparison of the LH activity among the LH 
chromophores that were examined, we introduced the k1 term, which represents the 
extent of the functional coupling of LH and the photochemical reactions in the 
RC. We determined that the hydrophobic fluorophore ATTO647N attached to LH1 
possesses the highest LH activity among the examined hydrophilic fluorophores 
such as Alexa647, and its activity is comparable to that of native LH1(-RC). The 
LH activity of LH2 (from Rhodoblastus acidophilus strain 10050) and its 
biohybrid LH2s were examined for the comprehensive assessment of their LH 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Identifying the underlying mechanisms through which adverse 
childhood experiences affect (ACEs) the mental health of adolescents is of 
paramount importance for disease prevention in later stages of life.
OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the relationship between ACEs and 
psychopathology in adolescents from northern Chile and how attachment style 
(abandonment anxiety and intimacy avoidance) may moderate this relationship. A 
total of 154 schooled adolescents aged 12 to 17 (M = 15.08, SD = 1.64) completed 
a series of self-report questionnaires including the Adverse Childhood 
Experience Questionnaire (ACEs), Experiences in Close Relationships- 
Relationship Structures (ECR-RS), and Youth Self Report (YSR-18).
RESULTS: The data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 25, which included 
descriptive analysis, one-way ANOVA, and Spearman correlation analysis. To 
address moderation analysis, the PROCESS macro extension version 4.1 was 
employed. In this process, the bootstrap method was applied to construct 
confidence intervals, and the pick-a-point approach was used to define the 
levels of the moderating variable. According to the results, 80.3% of the sample 
experienced one or more ACEs, and 16.4% reported experiencing at least three. 
Furthermore, the variables under study exhibited significant correlations with 
each other, except for intimacy avoidance, which showed no correlation with ACEs 
(rho = -0.10; p = 0.273). When considering abandonment anxiety as a moderating 
variable, the direct effect of ACEs on externalizing symptoms showed 
statistically significant changes (β = 0.60, p = 0.03). No other moderating 
effects were found according to the proposed models.
CONCLUSION: In childhood, the accumulation of ACEs is associated with the 
development of psychopathology in adolescents from northern Chile, specifically 
with the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These findings 
suggest that lower levels of abandonment anxiety could mitigate the effects of 
ACEs on adolescent psychopathology, while higher levels of abandonment anxiety 
could exacerbate these effects on psychopathology.

IMPORTANCE: Substantial racial inequities exist across the HIV care continuum 
between non-Hispanic Black and White men who have sex with men (MSM) in the US.
OBJECTIVES: To project years of life gained (YLG) with improving the HIV care 
continuum among Black MSM and White MSM in the US and to determine the outcomes 
of achieving health equity goals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS 
Complications microsimulation model was used and populated with 2021 
race-specific data to simulate HIV care among Black MSM and White MSM in the US 
who have acquired HIV. Analyses were completed from July 2021 to October 2023.
INTERVENTION: The study simulated status quo care using race-specific estimates: 
age at infection, time to diagnosis, receipt of care, and virologic suppression. 
The study next projected the outcomes of attaining equity-centered vs 
non-equity-centered goals by simulating 2 equal improvements in care goals: 
(10-point increased receipt of care and 5-point increased virologic 
suppression), 3 equity-centered goals (annual HIV testing, 95% receiving HIV 
care, and 95% virologic suppression) and lastly, an equitable care continuum 
that achieves annual HIV testing, 95% receiving care, and 95% virologic 
suppression in Black MSM and White MSM. One-way and multiway sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean age at death and YLG.
RESULTS: In the simulated cohort, the mean (SD) age at HIV infection was 27.0 
(10.8) years for Black MSM and 35.5 (13.6) years for White MSM. In status quo, 
mean age at death would be 68.8 years for Black MSM and 75.6 years for White 
MSM. The equal improvements in care goals would result in 0.5 YLG for Black MSM 
and 0.5 to 0.9 YLG for White MSM. Achieving any 1 equity-centered goal would 
result in 0.5 to 1.7 YLG for Black MSM and 0.4 to 1.3 YLG for White MSM. With an 
equitable care continuum compared with the nationally reported status quo, Black 
MSM and White MSM would gain 3.5 and 2.1 life-years, respectively. If the status 
quo HIV testing was every 6 years with 75% retained in care and 75% 
virologically suppressed, Black MSM would gain 4.2 life-years with an equitable 
care continuum.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation modeling study of HIV care goals, 
equal improvements in HIV care for Black and White MSM maintained or worsened 
inequities. These results suggest that equity-centered goals for the HIV care 
continuum are critical to mitigate long-standing inequities in HIV outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is becoming more of a chronic disease due to improvements in 
treatment and early detection for multiple cancer sites. To gain insight on 
increased life expectancy due to these improvements, we quantified trends in the 
loss in expectation of life (LEL) due to a cancer diagnosis for six cancer sites 
from 1975 through 2018.
METHODS: We focused on patients diagnosed with female breast cancer, chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML), colon and rectum cancer (CRC), diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), lung cancer, or melanoma between 1975 and 2018 from nine 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries. Life 
expectancies for cancer patients aged 50+ were modeled using flexible parametric 
survival models. LEL was calculated as the difference between general population 
life expectancy and life expectancy for cancer patients.
RESULTS: Over 2 million patients were diagnosed with one of the six cancers 
between 1975 and 2018. Large increases in life expectancy were observed between 
1990 and 2010 for female breast, DLBCL, and CML. Patients with CRC and melanoma 
had more gradual improvements in life expectancy. Lung cancer LEL only began 
decreasing after 2005. Increases in life expectancy corresponded with decreases 
in LEL for cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported gains in life expectancy largely correspond to 
progress in the screening, management, and treatment of these six cancers since 
1975.
IMPACT: LEL provides an important public health perspective on how improvements 
in treatment and early detection and their impacts on survival translate into 
changes in cancer patients' life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with life-limiting illnesses are prone to unnecessary 
polypharmacy. Deprescribing tools may contribute to minimizing negative 
outcomes. Thus, the aims of the study were to identify validated instruments for 
deprescribing inappropriate medications for patients with palliative care needs 
and to assess the impact on clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in LILACS, PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, 
and WEB OF SCIENCE databases (until May 2021). A manual search was performed in 
the references of enrolled articles. The screening, eligibility, extraction, and 
bias risk assessment were carried out by two independent researchers. 
Experimental and observational studies were eligible for inclusion.
RESULTS: Out of the 5,791 studies retrieved, after excluding duplicates (n = 
1,050), conducting title/abstract screening (n = 4,741), and full reading (n = 
41), only one study met the inclusion criteria. In this included study, a 
randomized controlled trial was conducted, which showed a high level of bias 
risk overall. Adults 75 years or older (n = 130) with limited life expectancy 
and polypharmacy were allocated to two groups [intervention arm (deprescribing); 
and control arm (usual care)]. Deprescribing was performed with the aid of the 
STOPPFrail tool. The mean number of inappropriate medications and monthly 
medication costs were significantly lower in the intervention arm. No 
statistically significant differences were found in terms of unscheduled 
hospital presentations, falls, fractures, mortality, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of several instruments to support 
deprescribing in patients with palliative care needs, only one of them has 
undergone validation and robust assessment for effectiveness in clinical 
practice. The STOPPFrail tool appears to reduce the number of inappropriate 
medications for older people with limited life expectancy (and probably 
palliative care needs) and decrease the monthly costs of pharmacotherapy. 
Nevertheless, the impact on patient safety and humanistic outcomes remain 
unclear.

PURPOSE: For patients with obesity and congestive heart failure (CHF) who 
require heart transplantation (HT), aggressive weight loss has been associated 
with ventricular remodeling, or subclinical alterations in left and right 
ventricular structure that affect systolic function. Many have suggested 
offering metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) for these patients. As such, we 
evaluated the role of MBS in HT for patients with obesity and CHF using 
predictive modelling techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov decision analysis was performed to simulate the 
life expectancy of 30,000 patients with concomitant obesity, CHF, and 30% 
ejection fraction (EF) who were deemed ineligible to be waitlisted for HT unless 
they achieved a BMI < 35 kg/m2. Life expectancy following diet and exercise 
(DE), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) was 
estimated. Base case patients were defined as having a pre-intervention BMI of 
45 kg/m2. Sensitivity analysis of initial BMI was performed.
RESULTS: RYGB patients had lower rates of HT and received HT quicker when 
needed. Base case patients who underwent RYGB gained 2.2 additional mean years 
survival compared with patients who underwent SG and 10.3 additional mean years 
survival compared with DE. SG patients gained 6.2 mean years of life compared 
with DE.
CONCLUSION: In this simulation of 30,000 patients with obesity, CHF, and reduced 
EF, MBS was associated with improved survival by not only decreasing the need 
for transplantation due to improvements in EF, but also increasing access to HT 
when needed due to lower average BMI.

BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, more than one million patients have type 2 
diabetes (T2D), and approximately 36% of these patients have chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Yearly medical costs related to T2D and CKD account for 
approximately €1.3 billion and €805 million, respectively. The FIDELIO-DKD trial 
showed that the addition of finerenone to the standard of care (SoC) lowers the 
risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with CKD 
stages 2-4 associated with T2D. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness 
of adding finerenone to the SoC of patients with advanced CKD and T2D compared 
to SoC monotherapy.
METHODS: The validated FINE-CKD model is a Markov cohort model which simulates 
the disease pathway of patients over a lifetime time horizon. The model was 
adapted to reflect the Dutch societal perspective. The model estimated the 
incremental costs, utilities, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the effect of 
parameter uncertainty on model robustness.
RESULTS: When used in conjunction with SoC, finerenone extended time free of CV 
events and renal replacement therapy by respectively 0.30 and 0.31 life years 
compared to SoC alone, resulting in an extension of 0.20 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). The reduction in renal and CV events led to a €6136 decrease in 
total lifetime costs per patient compared to SoC alone, establishing finerenone 
as a dominant treatment option. Finerenone in addition to SoC had a 83% 
probability of being dominant and a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000.
CONCLUSION: By reducing the risk of CKD progression and CV events, finerenone 
saves costs to society while gaining QALYs in patients with T2D and advanced CKD 
in the Netherlands.

Pythiosis is an infectious disease in humans and animals caused by an aquatic 
fungus-like micro-organism, Pythium insidiosum. Vascular pythiosis is a 
difficult condition to treat and can lead to loss of limb in addition to being a 
potentially life-threatening infection. The condition is furthermore unfamiliar 
among healthcare workers, which often results in delayed treatment or even 
misdiagnosis. In this study, we report our findings, which have been gathered 
over a 20-year period in caring for vascular pythiosis in Maharaj Nakorn Chiang 
Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand. We made a retrospective medical review of 32 
patients presented with arterial occlusion who have serum anti-Pythium 
insidiosum antibodies. All patients underwent computed tomography angiography to 
confirm the level of arterial occlusion and decided on a treatment plan. Twelve 
out of 22 patients with infrainguinal disease, femoropopliteal or below-knee 
vascular occlusion, survived. The mean survival time is 6.58 years. Eight in 10 
patients presented with suprainguinal disease died during the follow-up with a 
mean survival time of 31.6 months. The suprainguinal extension of the disease 
influenced the outcome, resulting in a higher mortality rate. However, patients 
presented with chronic limb ischemia had a much greater rate of survival 
compared to other clinical presentations. Extensive surgical resection combined 
with antifungal treatment and immunotherapy have proven to be effective in 
patients with vascular pythiosis in our findings.

Objectives: Research considered patient outcomes primarily over caregivers in 
end-of-life care settings. The importance of family caregivers (FCs) in 
end-of-life care draws growing awareness, evidenced by an increasing number of 
evaluations of caregiver-targeted interventions. Little is known of FCs' 
collateral benefits in patient-oriented home-based end-of-life care. The study 
aims to investigate FC outcomes and change mechanisms in patient-oriented care. 
Methods: A pre-post-test study. We recruited FCs whose patients with a life 
expectancy ≤ 6 months enrolled in home-based end-of-life care provided by 
service organizations in Hong Kong. Patients' symptoms, dimensions of caregiving 
strain (ie, perception of caregiving, empathetic strain, adjustment demands), 
and aspects of FCs' wellbeing (ie, perceived health, positive mood, life 
satisfaction, spiritual well-being) were measured at baseline (T0) and 3 months 
later (T1). Results: Of the 345 FCs at T0, 113 provided T1 measures. Three 
months after the service commenced, FCs' caregiving strain significantly 
reduced, and their positive mood improved. Alleviation of the patient's physical 
symptoms predicted FC better outcomes, including the perception of caregiving, 
empathetic strain, and wellbeing. Changes in perception of caregiving mediated 
the effects of changes in patients' physical symptoms on FCs' changes in life 
satisfaction and spiritual wellbeing. Changes in empathetic strain mediated the 
changes between patient's physical symptoms and FCs' positive mood. Conclusions: 
Collateral benefits of patient-oriented home-based end-of-life care were 
encouraging for FCs. Patient's physical symptom management matters to FCs' 
caregiving strain and wellbeing. The active ingredients modifying FCs' 
perception of caregiving and addressing empathetic strain may amplify their 
benefits in wellbeing.

(1)Y. B. Chavan College of Pharmacy, Roza Bagh, Aurangabad, MH, 431001, India.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is the predominant autosomal recessive disorder 
known to reduce life expectancy. Research findings indicate that around 60 to 
70% of adult individuals with this condition carry infections of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa.
OBJECTIVE: The ongoing research investigates the potential synergy of merging 
ivacaftor and ciprofloxacin to address bacterial infections.
METHODS: The two drugs were spray-dried into microparticles, which were then 
coated with Lsalbutamol and were to be delivered by a dry powder inhaler. 
Microparticles were generated by applying the spray drying method, utilizing 
bovine serum albumin and L-leucine in their preparation. Additionally, 
L-salbutamol was mixed and adsorbed onto the surface of the spray-dried 
microparticles, and it acted as a bronchodilator.
RESULTS: The microparticles produced via spray drying exhibited a particle size 
measuring 1.6 ± 0.04 μm, along with a polydispersity ratio of 0.33. Their zeta 
potential measured -27.3 ± 1.1 mV, while the mass median aerodynamic diameter of 
these microparticles was 3.74 ± 0.08 μm. SEM, XRD, and FTIR studies confirmed 
the entrapment of ivacaftor and ciprofloxacin. The morphology was observed by 
SEM and TEM scans. Antibacterial synergy was confirmed through the agar broth 
and dilution method, and the formulation's safety was established based on the 
outcomes of the MTT assay.
CONCLUSION: Using spray-dried microparticles containing ciprofloxacin, 
ivacaftor, and L-salbutamol presents a novel approach to the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the incidence and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of neurological disorders worldwide from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We obtained age-standardised incidence and DALY rates of neurological 
disorders in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) database. We determined trends stratified by age, sex, 
region, country, and Social Development Index (SDI) and the risk factors 
contributing to DALYs associated with these neurological disorders.
RESULTS: The largest increases in the age-standardised incidence rates of 
neurological disorders in 1990-2019 occurred in four regions (East Asia: 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = 0.19, tropical Latin America: 
EAPC = 0.07, Southern Latin America: EAPC = 0.03, Western Europe: EAPC = 0.03) 
and three countries (China: EAPC = 0.20, Ecuador: EAPC = 0.13, Italy: 
EAPC = 0.13). We observed the largest increases in age-standardised incidence 
rates for Parkinson disease, idiopathic epilepsy, and bipolar disorder, and in 
age-standardised DALY rates for Alzheimer disease and other dementias. High-SDI 
regions showed the highest EAPC for age-standardised incidence rates of 
Parkinson disease, depression, and motor neuron disease, and age-standardised 
DALY rates of neurological disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to control the increase in age-standardised 
incidence rates of neurological disorders in East Asia, tropical Latin America, 
Southern Latin America, and Western Europe, particularly in China, Ecuador, and 
Italy.

Ocular tumours may arise from various tissues and therefore present as a 
heterogeneous group of diseases with unspecific symptoms. Some of the tumours 
carry a high mortality with a life expectancy less than 50% after ten years. 
Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good outcome, and 
centralization has led to a decreased morbidity and increased survival in 
Denmark. Tumour-specific somatic mutations can be used for personalized 
follow-up programmes and may lead to new treatment modalities, as argued in this 
review.
