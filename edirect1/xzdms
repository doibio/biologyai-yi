Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) also known as 
spotted-wing drosophila (SWD), is a pest native to Southeast Asia. In the last 
few decades, the pest has expanded its range to affect all major European and 
American fruit production regions. SWD is a highly adaptive insect that is able 
to disperse, survive, and flourish under a range of environmental conditions. 
Infestation by SWD generates both direct and indirect economic impacts through 
yield losses, shorter shelf life of infested fruit, and increased production 
costs. Fresh markets, frozen berries, and fruit export programs have been 
impacted by the pest due to zero tolerance for fruit infestation. As SWD control 
programs rely heavily on insecticides, exceedance of maximum residue levels 
(MRLs) has also resulted in crop rejections. The economic impact of SWD has been 
particularly severe for organic operations, mainly due to the limited 
availability of effective insecticides. Integrated pest management (IPM) of SWD 
could significantly reduce chemical inputs but would require substantial changes 
to horticultural management practices. This review evaluates the most promising 
methods studied as part of an IPM strategy against SWD across the world. For 
each of the considered techniques, the effectiveness, impact, sustainability, 
and stage of development are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)-related pandemic 
represents a global source of societal and health burden. Yet, the impact of the 
pandemic on people with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder (BD), 
remains unclear, warranting scoping review on the matter.
METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from 
inception up to April 24, 2021, adopting broad inclusion criteria to assess a 
variety of clinical and public health themes related to people with a primary 
diagnosis of BD during the COVID-19 pandemics. The present work complying with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) 
repository (https://osf.io/7evpx/).
RESULTS: Fourteen papers informed the present scoping review. Four major themes 
were identified: (i) impact of COVID-19-related stressors on BD; (ii) impact of 
COVID-19 on mental health service utilization among people with BD; (iii) impact 
of BD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection; (iv) engagement in 
preventative behaviors among people with BD. Additional themes warranting 
further research were nonetheless detected.
LIMITATIONS: Further original studies are needed.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed the high-vulnerability hypothesis 
concerning people with BD versus the general population, reinforcing the need 
for further research related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information is 
warranted to compare the impact of the pandemic period among BD people against 
pre-pandemic records, the general population, and other severe mental illnesses, 
namely people with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, to inform the 
public health and the delivery of patient-tailored interventions.

Aim: To compare the cost-effectiveness of olaparib versus control treatment in 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with at least one gene 
mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM from the US payer perspective. Methods: A Markov 
model was constructed to assess the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses and scenario 
analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties. Results: The 
base-case result indicated that, for patients with specific gene mutations, 
olaparib gained 1.26 QALYs and USD$157,732 total cost. Compared with control 
treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olaparib was 
USD$248,248/QALY. The price of olaparib was the most influential parameter. 
Conclusion: Olaparib is not cost effective in comparison with control treatment 
in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with specific gene 
mutations.

BACKGROUND: Much of the current evidence of associations between long-term PM2.5 
and health outcomes relies on national or regional analyses using exposures 
derived directly from regulatory monitoring data. These findings could be 
affected by limited spatial coverage of monitoring data, particularly for time 
periods before spatially extensive monitoring began in the late 1990s. For 
instance, Pope et al. (2009) showed that between 1980 and 2000 a 10 μg/m3 
reduction in PM2.5 was associated with an average 0.61 year (standard error 
(SE) = 0.20) longer life expectancy. That analysis used 1979-1983 averages of 
PM2.5 across 51 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) computed from about 
130 monitoring sites. Our reanalysis re-examines this association using modeled 
PM2.5 in order to assess population- or spatially-representative exposure. We 
hypothesized that modeled PM2.5 with finer spatial resolution provides more 
accurate health effect estimates compared to limited monitoring data.
METHODS: We used the same data for life expectancy and confounders, as well as 
the same analysis models, and investigated the same 211 continental U.S. 
counties, as Pope et al. (2009). For modeled PM2.5, we relied on a 
previously-developed point prediction model based on regulatory monitoring data 
for 1999-2015 and back-extrapolation to 1979. Using this model, we predicted 
annual average concentrations at centroids of all 72,271 census tracts and 
12,501 25-km national grid cells covering the contiguous U.S., to represent 
population and space, respectively. We averaged these predictions to the county 
for the two time periods (1979-1983 and 1999-2000), whereas the original 
analysis used MSA averages given limited monitoring data. Finally, we estimated 
regression coefficients for PM2.5 reduction on life expectancy improvement over 
the two periods, adjusting for area-level confounders.
RESULTS: A 10 μg/m3 decrease in modeled PM2.5 based on census tract and national 
grid predictions was associated with 0.69 (standard error (SE) = 0.31) and 0.81 
(0.29) -year increases in life expectancy. These estimates are higher than the 
estimate of Pope et al. (2009); they also have larger SEs likely because of 
smaller variability in exposure predictions, a standard property of regression. 
Two sets of effect estimates, however, had overlapping confidence intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach for estimating population- and 
spatially-representative PM2.5 concentrations based on census tract and national 
grid predictions, respectively, provided generally consistent findings to the 
original findings using limited monitoring data. This finding lends additional 
support to the evidence that reduced fine particulate matter contributes to 
extended life expectancy.

IMPORTANCE: Hypertension is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income 
countries, and it is an important preventable risk factor for cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs). Understanding the economic benefits of a hypertension control 
program is valuable to decision-makers.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent 
hypertension management program compared with usual care among patients with 
hypertension receiving care in public clinics in Argentina from a health care 
system perspective.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used a Markov model 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypertension management program among 
adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension in a low-income setting. 
Patient-level data (743 individuals for multicomponent intervention; 689 for 
usual care) from the Hypertension Control Program in Argentina trial (HCPIA) 
were used to estimate treatment effects and the risk of CVD. Three health states 
were included in each strategy: (1) low risk of CVD, (2) high risk of CVD, and 
(3) death. The total time horizon was the lifetime, and each cycle lasted 6 
months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model inputs were based on trial data and other 
published sources. Cost and utilities were discounted at a rate of 5% annually. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the multicomponent 
intervention and usual care was calculated using the difference in costs in 2017 
international dollars (INT $) divided by the difference in effectiveness in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way sensitivity analysis and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the uncertainty and 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In the original trial, the 743 participants in the intervention group 
(349 [47.0%] men) had a mean (SD) age of 56.2 (12.0) years, and the 689 
participants in the control group (311 [45.1%] men) had a mean (SD) age of 56.2 
(11.7) years. In the base-case analysis, the HCPIA program yielded 8.42 
discounted QALYs and accrued INT $3096 discounted costs, while usual care 
yielded 8.29 discounted QALYs and accrued INT $2473 discounted costs. The ICER 
for the HCPIA program was INT $4907/QALY gained. The model results remained 
robust in sensitivity analyses, and the model was most sensitive to parameters 
of program costs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the HCPIA multicomponent intervention 
vs usual care was a cost-effective strategy to improve hypertension management 
and reduce the risk of associated CVD among patients with hypertension who 
received services at public clinics in Argentina. This intervention program is 
likely transferable to other settings in Argentina or other lower- and 
middle-income countries.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding the latest global spatio-temporal pattern of lung 
cancer burden attributable to ambient fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) 
is crucial to prioritize global lung cancer prevention, as well as environment 
improvement.
METHODS: Data on lung cancer attributable to ambient PM2.5 were downloaded from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The numbers and age-standardized 
rates on lung cancer mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) 
were estimated by age, sex, region, and country. We used estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) to quantify the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR from 
1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of global lung cancer deaths and DALYs attributable 
to ambient PM2.5 was approximately 0.31 million and 7.02 million respectively, 
among which more deaths and DALYs occurred in males. At GBD region level, the 
heaviest burden occurred in East Asia, accounting for over 50% worldwide, with 
China ranked first worldwide. The number of ambient PM2.5 attributable lung 
cancer deaths and DALYs has over doubled from 1990 to 2019, but high 
sociodemographic index (SDI) region had a rapid decrease, with EAPC -2.21 in 
ASMR (95% CI: -2.32, -2.09). The age-specific mortality rate or DALY rate has 
increased in all age groups in low to middle SDI regions from 1990 to 2019. The 
ASMR or ASDR showed an inverted V-shaped association with SDI. The EAPC in ASMR 
or ASDR was highly negatively correlated with ASMR or ASDR in 1990 and SDI in 
2019, with coefficients around 0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of ambient PM2.5-related lung cancer deaths and DALYs 
has largely increased because of the increase of exposure to PM2.5, population 
growth, and aging. Local governments should do economic activities under the 
consideration of public health, especially in high-burden areas.

Elegant protein assembly to generate new biomaterials undergoes extremely rapid 
development for wide extension of biotechnology applications, which can be a 
powerful tool not only for creating nanomaterials but also for advancing 
understanding of the structure of life. Unique biological properties of proteins 
bestow these artificial biomaterials diverse functions that can permit them to 
be applied in encapsulation, bioimaging, biocatalysis, biosensors, 
photosynthetic apparatus, electron transport, magnetogenetic applications, 
vaccine development and antibodies design. This review gives a perspective view 
of the latest advances in the construction of protein-based nanomaterials. We 
initially start with distinguishable, specific interactions to construct sundry 
nanomaterials through protein self-assembly and concisely expound the assembly 
mechanism from the design strategy. And then, the design and construction of 0D,

Maize lethal necrosis disease (MLND) is a serious disease of worldwide 
importance. It is caused by the co-infection of maize with maize chlorotic 
mottle virus (MCMV) and a potyvirus, such as sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), that 
acts synergistically to produce more severe symptoms and production losses. More 
recently, maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV) and maize-associated totivirus 
(MATV) were found to co-infect with MCMV and SCMV in maize plants. To facilitate 
the detection of these viruses in co-infected maize, a multiplex RT-PCR assay 
was developed in this study. The assay used five specific primer pairs and 
simultaneously amplified these four viruses as well as the elongation factor 1α 
(EF 1α) gene use as internal control in one tube. The concentration of the 
primers, annealing temperature, annealing time, extension time and amplification 
cycles were optimized for the multiplex RT-PCR. The detection limit of the assay 
was up to 100 pg of total cDNA template. This multiplex RT-PCR assay was shown 
to be a sensitive and effective tool for the screening of field samples for the 
presence of these viruses in co-infected maize.

BACKGROUND: Despite the growing incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, there is yet to be a study to map the current burden of the 
disease on the continent. This scoping review aims to outline the literature on 
TBI.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping 
reviews. A search string was developed to identify studies relating to TBI 
epidemiology, management, and outcomes. The search was applied to Medline, 
Embase, and Global Medicus Index.
RESULTS: In total, 107 studies were included in the final analysis. More than 
one half originated from South Africa. Seventy-five studies were published in 
2013 or later. Studies recruited a median of 115 patients: 83.5 male and 31 
female. TBI affected all age groups (range = 0-105 years) and sexes but was more 
common among young males aged 20-40. Road traffic accidents caused TBI in a 
median of 71 patients. Other major causes included assault (median = 39.5) and 
falls (median = 12.5). Craniectomies were the most commonly reported surgical 
treatment (18.7%) followed by burr holes (7.5%). Four studies (3.7%) reported 
delays in seeking neurotrauma care, with delays in reaching a neurotrauma 
facility and delays in receiving care being reported in 15 studies (14%) each. 
Glasgow Outcome Scale score was reported in 28 (26.1%) studies, whereas quality 
of life measures were reported in 2 (1%). Younger age was associated with 
favorable outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased need for TBI research, education, and 
training in Sub-Saharan Africa. This will aid stakeholders in optimizing patient 
management and outcome.

BACKGROUND: This economic evaluation and literature review was conducted with 
the primary aim to compare the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic assisted 
supracervical hysterectomy (LASH) with NICE's gold-standard treatment of 
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for menorrhagia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from an NHS 
perspective, using data from two European studies to compare the treatments. 
Individual costs and benefits were assessed within one year of having the 
intervention. An Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was calculated, 
followed by sensitivity analysis. Expected Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS) 
and costs to the NHS were calculated alongside health net benefits (HNB) and 
monetary net benefits (MNB).
RESULTS: A QALY gain of 0.069 was seen in use of LNG-IUS compared to LASH. This 
yielded a MNB between -£44.99 and -£734.99, alongside a HNB between -0.0705 
QALYs and -0.106 QALYS. Using a £20,000-£30,000/QALY limit outlined by NICE,this 
showed the LNG-IUS to be more cost-effective than LASH, with LASH exceeding the 
upper bound of the £30,000/QALY limit. Sensitivity analysis lowered the ICER 
below the given threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER demonstrates it would not be cost-effective to replace the 
current gold-standard LNG-IUS with LASH, when treating menorrhagia in the UK. 
The ICER's proximity to the threshold and its high sensitivity alludes to the 
necessity for further research to generate a more reliable cost-effectiveness 
estimate. However, LASH could be considered as a first line treatment option in 
women with no desire to have children.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with solid malignancies are more vulnerable to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than the healthy 
population. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in highly immunosuppressed 
populations, such as in patients with hematological malignancies, is a point of 
interest. We aimed to analyze the symptoms, complications, intensive care unit 
admissions, and mortality rates of patients with hematological malignancies 
infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter study, we included 340 adult and 
pediatric patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 from March to November 2020. 
Diagnosis and status of primary disease, treatment schedules for hematological 
malignancies, time from last treatment, life expectancy related to the 
hematological disease, and comorbidities were recorded, together with data 
regarding symptoms, treatment, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RESULTS: Forty four patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis of SARS-CoV- 2 
infection. Among symptomatic patients, fever, cough, and dyspnea were observed 
in 62.6%, 48.8%, and 41.8%, respectively. Sixty-nine (20%) patients had mild 
SARS-CoV-2 disease, whereas moderate, severe, and critical disease was reported 
in 101 (29%), 71 (20%), and 55 (16%) patients, respectively. Of the entire 
cohort, 251 (73.8%) patients were hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. Mortality related 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 26.5% in the entire cohort; this comprised 4.4% of 
those patients with mild disease, 12.4% of those with moderate disease, and 83% 
of those with severe or critical disease. Active hematological disease, lower 
life expectancy related to primary hematological disease, neutropenia at 
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and first-line therapy used for 
coronavirus disease-2019 treatment were found to be related to higher mortality 
rates. Treatments with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with 
azithromycin were associated with a higher rate of mortality in comparison to 
favipiravir use.
CONCLUSION: Patients with hematological malignancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 have 
an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.

Publisher: AMAÇ: Solid malignite hastalarının şiddetli akut solunum yolu 
enfeksiyonu-koronavirüs-2 (SARS-CoV-2) enfeksiyonuna sağlıklı bireylerden daha 
yatkın oldukları gösterilmiştir. Bu verilerin ardından oldukça yoğun 
immünosupresif olan hematolojik malignite hastalarında SARS-CoV-2 infeksiyonu 
sonuçları ilgi konusu olmuştur. Biz de bu makalede Türkiye’de hematolojik 
malignite tanısı ile takip ve tedavi edilirken SARS-CoV-2 enfeksiyonu saptanan 
hastaların semptom, komplikasyon, yoğun bakım ünitesine yatış ve mortalite 
oranlarını değerlendirmeyi amaçladık.
GEREÇ VE YÖNTEMLER: Çok merkezli çalışmamıza Mart-Kasım 2020 tarihleri arasında 
SARS-CoV-2 enfeksiyonu tanısı alan erişkin ve pediatrik 340 hastayı dahil ettik. 
Hastaların hematolojik malignite tanıları, hastalık statusları, tedavileri, son 
tedaviden enfeksiyona kadar geçen süre, komorbiditeleri, yaşam beklentileri 
değerlendirildi. Semptomları, oluşan komplikasyonlar ve sonuçlar analiz edildi.
BULGULAR: Kırk-dört hasta semptomsuz olarak enfeksiyonu geçirirken, semptomatik 
hastaların ateş, öksürük, ve dispne oranları sırasıyla %62,6, %48,8 ve %41,8 
idi. Altmış altı hasta (%20) hastalığı hafif geçirirken, orta, ciddi ve kritik 
hastalık tanısı alanların oranı sırasıyla %29, %20 ve %16 idi. Tüm kohortta ölüm 
oranı %26,6 idi; ölüm hafif hastalığı olanlarda %4,4 , orta derece hastalık 
geçirenlerde %12 ve ciddi/kritik hastalık geçirenlerde ise %83 olarak saptandı. 
Aktif hematolojik hastalık olması, primer hematolojik hastalığa bağlı düşük 
hayat beklentisi, SARS-CoV-2 tanısı aldığında nötropenik olmak, yoğun bakıma 
alınmış olmak ve ilk sıra koronavirüs hastalığı-2019 tedavisi yüksek ölüm riski 
ile ilişkilendirilen faktörlerdendi. Tek başına veya azitromisin ile kombine 
olarak hidroksiklorokin kullanan hastaların sadece favipiravir kullananlara göre 
ölüm riskleri daha yüksek saptandı.
SONUÇ: SARS-CoV-2 infeksiyonu geçiren hematolojik malignite hastalarında daha 
yüksek oranda ciddi hastalık ve ölüm riski gözlenmektedir.

Mainstay haemophilia treatment, namely intravenous factor replacement, poses 
several clinical challenges including frequent injections due to the short 
half-life of recombinant factors, intravenous administration (which is 
particularly challenging in those with difficult venous access), and the risk of 
inhibitor development. These impact negatively upon quality of life and 
treatment compliance, highlighting the need for improved therapies. Several 
novel pharmacological therapies developed for haemophilia aim to rebalance the 
clotting cascade and potentially circumvent the aforementioned challenges. These 
therapies utilise a range of different mechanisms, namely: the extension of the 
circulating half-life of standard recombinant factors; the mimicking of factor 
VIII cofactor activity; rebalancing of coagulation through targeting of natural 
anticoagulants such as antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor; and 
inducing the production of endogenous factors with gene therapy. These therapies 
carry the potential of revolutionising haemophilia treatment by alleviating the 
current challenges presented by mainstay factor replacement. This review will 
provide an overview of the key trial findings related to novel therapies based 
on the mechanisms described above.

The incidence of nonunion of fractures has been steadily rising owing to 
improved life expectancy following severe injuries along with rising cases of 
polytrauma. Once a nonunion is established, the chances of spontaneous healing 
are deemed to be quite low. Fracture nonunion continues to be a challenge in 
clinical practice with nonunions having a considerable impact on patient's 
quality of life causing both functional and psychosocial disability. 
Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy is being projected as a viable 
and non-interventional alternative to surgical management of nonunions and 
delayed unions. LIPUS therapy is being widely recommended as a standalone 
treatment option for the treatment of established nonunions and delayed unions 
as it is believed to promote healing in all phases of fracture healing viz., 
inflammatory, intramembranous ossification, chondrogenesis, endochondral 
ossification and remodelling. In the current scenario of varying results and 
unclear clinical role of LIPUS therapy, we present a prospective case series of 
fracture nonunions and delayed unions treated with LIPUS therapy at a large 
District General Hospital.

The Importance of Understanding Parental Perception When Treating Primary 
Nocturnal Enuresis: A Topic Review and an Institutional Experience.

Primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is a common childhood disorder that adversely 
affects a child's mental well-being and social life. Our clinical experience 
showed parents and their child often have significantly different perspective of 
enuresis, and these differences can affect family dynamics, treatment 
approaches, and treatment success. Parents' perception of PNE also influences 
the likelihood of seeking medical treatment, and we found parents of children 
with enuresis have markedly different beliefs regarding bedwetting than those of 
physicians. Because achieving remission for PNE requires parents and their child 
to actively participate in treatment, assessing their expectancy of success and 
their beliefs will allow clinicians to adjust treatment goals as necessary. When 
treating PNE, guidelines consistently recommend incorporating bed alarms as part 
of the therapy. However, through interviewing parents and treating their 
children, we found parents preferred medications or other behavioral strategies, 
such as limiting water intake, because of their convenience. Many parents would 
complain bed alarms woke them up instead of their child, and they would soon 
give up on bed alarms. Part of assessing their beliefs includes assessing their 
confidence in their child being able to wake up to alarms and to persist with 
treatment. Understanding how they manage and approach setbacks will also 
determine the treatment modality suited for their child. In this review paper, 
we detailed our experiences interviewing parents and treating their child with 
NE with urodynamics and medications at the Changhua Christian Hospital in 
Taiwan.

Immigration and improvements in American life expectancy.

Hendi AS(1), Ho JY(2).

Author information:

Despite the immigrant mortality advantage and the increasing share of the 
population born abroad, relatively little is known about how immigration has 
impacted trends in US life expectancy. How immigrants contribute to national 
life expectancy trends is of increasing interest, particularly in the context of 
an unprecedented stagnation in American mortality. We find that immigration 
increases US life expectancy by 1.5 years for men and 1.4 years for women. Over 
half of these contributions occur at the prime working ages of 25-64. The 
difference between foreign-born and US-born mortality has grown substantially 
since 1990, with the ratio of US-born to foreign-born mortality rates nearly 
doubling by 2017. In that year, foreign-born life expectancy reached 81.4 and 
85.7 years for men and women, respectively-7.0 and 6.2 years higher than their 
US-origin counterparts. These life expectancy levels are remarkable by most 
standards. Foreign-born male life expectancy exceeds that of Swiss men, the 
world leaders in male life expectancy. Life expectancy for foreign-born women is 
close to that of Japanese women, the world leaders in female life expectancy. 
The widening mortality difference between the US-born and foreign-born 
populations, coupled with an increase in the share of the population born 
abroad, has been responsible for much of the increase in national life 
expectancy in recent years. Between 2007 and 2017, foreign-born men and women 
were responsible for 44% and 60% of national life expectancy improvements. 
Between 2010 and 2017, immigrants experienced gains while the US-born 
experienced declines in life expectancy. Thus, nearly all of the post-2010 
mortality stagnation is due to adverse trends among the US-born. Without 
immigrants and their children, national life expectancy in 2017 would be reduced 
to its 2003 levels. These findings demonstrate that immigration acts to bolster 
American life expectancy, with particularly valuable contributions at the prime 
working ages.
