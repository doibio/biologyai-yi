OBJECTIVE: Aging and AD are associated in some way, then it is reasonable to ask 
whether or not it is possible to age without AD inexorably appearing at any 
moment, depending on the period of life. Therefore, the goal of this review is 
to verify, in light of some aging theories, the prevalence of AD.
METHODS: For the purpose of this manuscript, the indexers Alzheimer, aging, 
Alzheimer, and aging were considered; theories of aging were researched. The 
research was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Elsevier, and Google 
Scholar.
RESULTS: The most common subjects in the papers analyzed for this manuscript 
were aging and Alzheimer's disease. The association between Alzheimer and 
theories of aging seems inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, the general idea is that AD is associated with aging 
in such a way that almost all people will present this disease; however, it is 
plausible to consider that the increase in life expectancy will generate a high 
prevalence of AD. In a general sense, it seems that the theories of aging 
explain the origin of AD under superlative and catastrophic considerations and 
use more biomolecular data than social or behavioral data as the bases of 
analysis, which may be the problem.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with a lowered life expectancy due to 
cardiovascular disease. This is, at least in part, related to an increased 
vulnerability to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with 
schizophrenia. The dysregulation of apolipoproteins (Apos) may also play a role 
in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia via their effect on cerebral cholesterol 
processing.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate serum Apos A1, C3, E, A2 and C2 
concentration in schizophrenia patients with or without MetS in comparison to 
healthy donors.
METHODS: After obtaining informed consent, 53 patients with a diagnosis of 
paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria (F20) were included. 
Patients were divided into two groups with (N = 26) and without (N = 27) MetS 
according to the criteria of the International Diabetes Federation. The control 
group included 20 mentally and physically healthy subjects. Serum Apos A1, A2, 
C2, C3 and E were measured using xMAP technology (Luminex).
RESULTS: Serum ApoA1 was significantly decreased in patients with schizophrenia 
compared to healthy subjects (p = 0.002); ApoA2 was lower in patients without 
MetS in comparison to patients with MetS (p = 0.017) and the levels of ApoC3 and 
ApoC2 were increased in patients with schizophrenia with MetS in comparison with 
the control group and also with patients without MetS. No other significant 
differences were established concerning the other assayed apolipoproteins.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with literature data the results of our study suggest that 
while disturbances in ApoA1 level may play a role in the pathogenesis of 
schizophrenia, ApoA2, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE may be primarily related to 
metabolic imbalance.

PURPOSE: The role of parenteral nutrition in the treatment of malignant bowel 
obstruction is underestimated since palliative literature mainly focuses on 
gastric aspiration, nothing per os and antisecretory therapy. The purpose of 
this review is the appraisal of the literature with a focus on the potential 
contribution of parenteral nutrition.
METHODS: Literature included in a recent meta-analysis and in a Cochrane review 
on parenteral nutrition in malignant bowel obstruction and updated through 
PUBMED until March 2019 has been reviewed.
RESULTS: Prompt withholding of food intake, nasogastric aspiration and then the 
use of antisecretory agents represent the milestones of treatment which are 
applied to all patients with malignant bowel obstruction. After this initial 
approach, excluding few surgical patients and those defined as imminently dying, 
there is a heterogeneous group of patients achieving a benefit in a few days but 
with a prompt recurrence of symptoms as they attempt to reassume some food 
intake. Parenteral nutrition in hospital or at home addresses to these patients 
provided their life expectancy is likely to depend on progressive nutritional 
deterioration due to the prolonged starvation more than on the tumour spread. 
These patients on home parenteral nutrition can survive a few months with some 
indefinite benefit on quality of life whereas untreated patients have a survival 
of few weeks.
CONCLUSION: Parenteral nutrition should be considered in selected patients who 
benefit from standard palliative treatment of malignant obstruction and are 
obliged to maintain a total bowel rest for weeks or months.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to construct an early economic 
evaluation for acalabrutinib for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to 
assist early reimbursement decision making. Scenarios were assessed to find the 
relative impact of critical parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed comparing acalabrutinib 
and ibrutinib from a UK national health service perspective. This model included 
states for progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and 
death. PFS and overall survival (OS) were parametrically extrapolated from 
ibrutinib publications and a preliminary hazard ratio based on phase I/II data 
was applied for acalabrutinib. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed, and 1296 scenarios were assessed.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
£61,941/QALY, with 3.44 incremental QALYs and incremental costs of £213,339. 
Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that survival estimates, utilities 
and treatment costs of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib and resource use during PFS 
have the greatest influence on the ICER. Probabilistic results under different 
development scenarios indicated that greater efficacy of acalabrutinib would 
decrease the likelihood of cost effectiveness (from 63% at no effect to 2% at 
maximum efficacy). Scenario analyses showed that a reduction in PFS did not lead 
to great QALY differences (- 8 to - 14% incremental QALYs) although it did 
greatly affect costs (- 47 to - 122% incremental pounds). For OS, the opposite 
was true (- 89 to - 93% QALYs and - 7 to - 39% pounds).
CONCLUSIONS: Acalabrutinib is not likely to be cost effective compared with 
ibrutinib under current development scenarios. The conflicting effects of OS, 
PFS, drug costs and utility during PFS show that determining the cost 
effectiveness of acalabrutinib without insight into all parameters complicates 
health technology assessment decision making. Early assessment of the cost 
effectiveness of new products can support development choices and reimbursement 
processes through effective early dialogues between stakeholders.

AIMS: Although the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is 
still not completely understood, the deregulated microglia polarization and 
neuroinflammation have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis and 
progression of this disease. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether 
hirsutella sinensis (HS) could reduce neuroinflammatory and pathological changes 
in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A model mice of ALS and consequently ameliorate 
disease onset and progression.
METHODS: SOD1G93A mice were chronically treated with HS by gavage. Their 
lifespan was recorded, and motor behavior was evaluated by rotarod test. The 
pathological changes in skeletal muscles and motor neurons in spinal cords were 
assessed by immunofluorescent staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The 
microglia activation and neuroinflammation were determined by immunofluorescent 
staining and RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Our data suggested that repeated HS administration prolonged the 
lifespan and extended disease duration of ALS mice without significant delay on 
disease onset. HS ameliorated the pathological changes in the motor neurons and 
gastrocnemius muscles. Moreover, HS promoted the transition of microglia from 
pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in the spinal cord of ALS 
mice.
CONCLUSION: All these findings indicate that HS may serve as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALS.

Muscle wasting diseases are gradually increasing with the increase in global 
life expectancy. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of HIM-CHX, a 
herbal combination of Boswellia serrata, Cissus quadrangularis, and Withania 
somnifera, on Sarcopenia. The effects of HIM-CHX on parameters such as muscle 
mass, grip strength, motor coordination, gait, locomotor activity and endurance 
were measured in rats. In addition to this, inflammatory cytokines, myokine and 
growth hormone levels were also evaluated. In the first experiment, HIM-CHX was 
administered orally to rats at the dose of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg body weight 
for 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, muscle mass, grip strength, 
motor coordination and proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. In the second 
experiment, HIM-CHX was administered orally at a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight 
for 4 weeks and gait analysis, locomotor activity, endurance and endogenous 
antioxidant activity were evaluated. The animals treated with HIM-CHX showed a 
significant improvement in gastrocnemius muscle weight, carcass weight, gait, 
locomotor activity and endurance. HIM-CHX exerts its effect by reducing the 
levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and Myostatin while increasing the IGF-1 levels which are 
the typical biomarkers of muscle wasting. Furthermore, the study findings 
indicate that HIM-CHX has the potential to correct the pathophysiological 
changes associated with sarcopenia.

BACKGROUND: Proton radiation therapy offers advantages over photon therapy, 
assisting with severe side effect avoidance. Pediatric patients with 
medulloblastoma have demonstrated benefit from this technology in recently 
published cohort studies.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the costs and benefits between proton and photon therapy 
in treating pediatric medulloblastoma.
METHODS: The model was built with a lifetime horizon from the Brazilian health 
system perspective using a 3% discount rate. A microsimulation model was 
developed after a literature search, comparing scenarios of equipment life span 
and number of patients treated per year (50, 100, and 150 patients with 10, 25, 
and 20 years of equipment life span). The baseline parameters were 50 patients 
treated annually and 20 years of equipment life span.
RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life-year gain was 2.71, and the average 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $34 590.54 per quality-adjusted 
life-year. For the willingness-to-pay threshold of 1 gross domestic product per 
capita, it was observed that the incorporation of the technology would be 
cost-effective if more than 150 patients were treated per year. The weight of 
the equipment life span and other variables was limited when it varied in the 
sensitivity analysis, without significant changes to the model results.
CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is not cost-effective for pediatric medulloblastoma 
treatment from the Brazilian health system perspective. The investment is not 
worth when considering the number of potential patients and the country 
dimensions.

INTRODUCTION: Whether patients with early-onset dementia have poorer or improved 
survival compared with those with a late onset largely depends on the survival 
measure. Survival estimates for early-onset mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
diagnosis are particularly scarce. We aimed to estimate life expectancy (LE) in 
patients with early-onset dementia or early MCI, and loss in expectation of life 
(LEL) for these groups. Comparisons were made with the general Norwegian 
population and a subgroup of patients with late-onset dementia.
METHODS: Early onset was defined as receiving a diagnosis of MCI or dementia 
before age 65 years. LE and LEL were predicted using flexible parametric 
survival models. Our study population was comprised of newly diagnosed 
(incident) cases (n = 4,906), aged 50-90 years at the time of diagnosis (672 
were diagnosed before age 65 years, of which 291 were diagnosed with dementia), 
in the Norwegian register of persons assessed for cognitive symptoms (NorCog) 
between 2009 and 2017, and patients were followed up for mortality or censorship 
until January 2018.
RESULTS: Among the early-onset patients, 8 and 23% died during follow-up, in the 
MCI and dementia groups, respectively. Both early-onset MCI and especially 
early-onset dementia were associated with lower LE than in the general Norwegian 
population; LE for 60-year-old women in 2016 was 26 years in the general 
population, 20 years in MCI patients, and 7 years in dementia patients. The 
corresponding LE at 80 years was 10, 6, and 5 years. Thus, LEL were particularly 
pronounced for patients with early dementia. The diagnosis-specific LE pattern 
in men was similar to that in women.
DISCUSSION: Early-onset MCI was associated with substantial life years lost (5-6 
years), but the loss was particularly pronounced for those with early-onset 
dementia, reducing the expected life length by 2 decades.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs mainly in 
the elderly and presenile life stages. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 
135 million people will be affected by AD worldwide, representing a huge burden 
to society. The pathological hallmarks of AD mainly include intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) caused by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, 
formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, and massive neural cell death in the 
affected nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD is very complicated, and recent 
scientific research on AD is mainly concentrated on the cortex and hippocampus. 
Although the spinal cord is a pivotal part of the central nervous system, there 
are a limited number of studies focusing on the spinal cord. As an extension of 
the brain, the spinal cord functions as the bridge between the brain and various 
parts of the body. However, pathological changes in the spinal cord in AD have 
not been comprehensively and systematically studied at present. We here review 
the existing progress on the pathological features of AD in the spinal cord.

BACKGROUND: Caring for a partner with primary malignant brain tumour can be a 
dramatic life-changing event. Primary malignant brain tumour is known to give 
poor life expectancy and severe neurological and cognitive symptoms, such as 
changed behaviour and personality, which demand greater caring responsibilities 
from spouses.
AIM: The aim of the study is to explore ethical dilemmas spouses experience in 
the everyday care of a partner in treatment for primary malignant brain tumour.
RESEARCH DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A phenomenological and 
hermeneutic qualitative descriptive design was adopted as a method for 
collecting and analysing data. Ten spouses were interviewed twice using an 
in-depth, semi-structured interview guide. The interviews took place at the 
spouses' homes or at the hospital.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATION: Ethical matters were considered throughout the research 
process. Permission from The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and 
the Danish Data Protection Agency was obtained.
FINDINGS: The analysis showed that the spouses perceived daily ethical dilemmas 
in caring for a partner with primary malignant brain tumour. Their life as well 
as their partner's life had changed considerably. The main theme that emerged 
therefore was 'oscillating in a changing relationship'. This theme was further 
elaborated in three subthemes that in more detail demonstrated the dilemmas: 
'doing the right thing in unpredictable daily situations'; 'torn between 
patience and guilt'; and 'living in a time of uncertainty, hope and despair'.
CONCLUSION: Caring for a partner with changed behaviour and personality due to 
primary malignant brain tumour may involve exhausting ethical caring dilemmas. 
Spouses' married life may change to a semi-professional asymmetrical 
relationship, which is challenged by the oscillation between acting responsibly 
for their partners' well-being and caring dilemmas with no answer for what the 
right thing to do is. Mixed feelings of right and wrong, patience and guilt, 
hope and despair seem to be spousal companions through their partners' 
progressing illness.

A New Method for Model-Based Health Economic Evaluation Utilizing and Extending 
Moment-Generating Functions.

Snowsill T(1).

Author information:
(1)Health Economics Group, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.

Background. Health economic evaluations frequently include projections for 
lifetime costs and health effects using modeling frameworks such as Markov 
modeling or discrete event simulation (DES). Markov models typically cannot 
represent events whose risk is determined by the length of time spent in state 
(sojourn time) without the use of tunnel states. DES is very flexible but 
introduces Monte Carlo variation, which can significantly limit the complexity 
of model analyses. Methods. We present a new methodological framework for health 
economic modeling that is based on, and extends, the concept of 
moment-generating functions (MGFs) for time-to-event random variables. When 
future costs and health effects are discounted, MGFs can be used to very 
efficiently calculate the total discounted life-years spent in a series of 
health states. Competing risks are incorporated into the method. This method can 
also be used to calculate discounted costs and health effects when these payoffs 
are constant per unit time, one-off, or exponential with regard to time. MGFs 
are extended to additionally support costs and health effects which are 
polynomial with regard to time (as in a commonly used model of population norms 
for EQ-5D utility). Worked Example. A worked example is used to demonstrate the 
application of the new method in practice and to compare it with Markov modeling 
and DES. Results are compared in terms of convergence and accuracy, and 
computation times are compared. R code and an Excel workbook are provided. 
Conclusions. The MGF method can be applied to health economic evaluations in the 
place of Markov modeling or DES and has certain advantages over both.

Background: Six to 20% of thyroid cancer (TC) patients develop distant 
metastases, and one-third become radioiodine refractory (RAIR). Available 
targeted therapies increase progression-free survival but are associated with 
toxicities. This study aims to characterize clinical, pathological, and 
molecular profiles of patients with RAIR TC. Methods: Data of TC patients seen 
during 2013-2017 at two tertiary care centers were retrospectively analyzed. 
Patients were considered RAIR according to American Thyroid Association 
guidelines. The control cohort was sex matched and age matched and had either 
regression or stable disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 
on follow-up at least three years after initial therapy. Molecular profiles on a 
subset of RAIR patients were reviewed. Results: Compared with 22 matched 
controls, 54 RAIR patients had an average age of 57 years (standard deviation 
[SD] = 13), 56% were male (41% in the control group); the average tumor size was 
4 cm (SD = 2.5); tumors were multifocal in 54%, with involved surgical margins 
in 42%, focal invasion in 79%, and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) in 61%. 
Sixty-six percent had distant metastases at initial presentation with metastases 
to the lungs in 85%, bone in 56%, both sites in 43%, brain in 9%, and liver in 
4%. There were no statistically significant differences between RAIR and 
controls in tumor size, focal invasion, ETE, and histology. The RAIR group 
received a higher cumulative radioactive iodine (RAI) dose and number of 
therapies compared with the controls (518 mCi vs. 302 mCi, p = 0.002 and 2.2 vs. 
1.3 treatments, p = 0.001). Overall, patients >46 years had 4.5 times higher 
odds ratio (OR) of being RAIR; white race/ethnicity was associated with a 
reduced OR of RAIR disease (OR 0.33, p = 0.079). Molecular profiling data in the 
RAIR subgroup indicated that 50% of patients harbored mutations in the RAS/RAF 
pathway (11/22). Among 19 patients with a more extensive molecular panel, median 
tumor mutational burden was 5 megabase (range 3-16) and 26% (5/19) exhibited 
strong PD-L1 positivity. Conclusion: Among patients with metastatic 
differentiated thyroid carcinomas, patients with RAIR have similar 
histopathological and clinical characteristics as patients with RAI avid cancer. 
The risk of having RAIR TC is increased at age ≥46 and reduced in Caucasians.

BACKGROUND: The short-term course of burnout in healthcare workers in low- and 
middle-income countries has undergone limited evaluation. The aim of this study 
was to assess the short-term outcome of burnout symptoms in the context of 
implementation of a new mental health programme in a rural African district.
METHODS: We followed up 145 primary healthcare workers (HCWs) working in 66 
rural primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in Southern Ethiopia, where a new 
integrated mental health service was being implemented. Burnout was assessed at 
baseline, i.e. when the new service was being introduced, and after 6 months. 
Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires, including the 
Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and instruments measuring professional 
satisfaction and psychosocial factors. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) 
were used to assess the association between change in the core dimension of 
burnout (emotional exhaustion) and relevant work-related and psychosocial 
factors.
RESULTS: A total of 136 (93.8%) of HCWs completed and returned their 
questionnaires at 6 months. There was a non-significant reduction in the burnout 
level between the two time points. In GEE regression models, high depression 
symptom scores (adjusted mean difference (aMD) 0.56, 95% CI 0.29, 0.83, 
p < 0.01), experiencing two or more stressful life events (aMD 1.37, 95% CI 
0.06, 2.14, p < 0.01), being a community health extension worker vs. 
facility-based HCW (aMD 5.80, 95% CI 3.21, 8.38, p < 0.01), perceived job 
insecurity (aMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.08, 1.38, p = 0.03) and older age (aMD 0.36, 95% 
CI 0.09, 0.63, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with higher levels of 
emotional exhaustion longitudinally.
CONCLUSION: In the short-term, there was no significant change in the level of 
burnout in the context of adding mental healthcare to the workload of HCWs. 
However, longer term and larger scale studies are required to substantiate this. 
This evidence can serve as baseline information for an intervention development 
to enhance wellbeing and reduce burnout.

BACKGROUND: In 2011, England introduced the Public Health Responsibility Deal 
(RD), a public-private partnership (PPP) which gave greater freedom to the food 
industry to set and monitor targets for salt intakes. We estimated the impact of 
the RD on trends in salt intake and associated changes in cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and gastric cancer (GCa) incidence, mortality and economic costs in 
England from 2011-2025.
METHODS: We used interrupted time series models with 24 hours' urine sample data 
and the IMPACTNCD microsimulation model to estimate impacts of changes in salt 
consumption on CVD and GCa incidence, mortality and economic impacts, as well as 
equity impacts.
RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2010 mean salt intake was falling annually by 0.20 
grams/day among men and 0.12 g/d among women (P-value for trend both < 0.001). 
After RD implementation in 2011, annual declines in salt intake slowed 
statistically significantly to 0.11 g/d among men and 0.07 g/d among women 
(P-values for differences in trend both P < 0.001). We estimated that the RD has 
been responsible for approximately 9900 (interquartile quartile range (IQR): 
6700 to 13,000) additional cases of CVD and 1500 (IQR: 510 to 2300) additional 
cases of GCa between 2011 and 2018. If the RD continues unchanged between 2019 
and 2025, approximately 26 000 (IQR: 20 000 to 31,000) additional cases of CVD 
and 3800 (IQR: 2200 to 5300) cases of GCa may occur.
INTERPRETATION: Public-private partnerships such as the RD which lack robust and 
independent target setting, monitoring and enforcement are unlikely to produce 
optimal health gains.

The hawkmoth Manduca sexta and one of its preferred hosts in the North American 
Southwest, Datura wrightii, share a model insect-plant relationship based on 
mutualistic and antagonistic life-history traits. D. wrightii is the innately 
preferred nectar source and oviposition host for M. sexta Hence, the hawkmoth is 
an important pollinator while the M. sexta larvae are specialized herbivores of 
the plant. Olfactory detection of plant volatiles plays a crucial role in the 
behavior of the hawkmoth. In vivo, the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco) is an 
obligatory component for the function of odorant receptors (ORs), a major 
receptor family involved in insect olfaction. We used CRISPR-Cas9 targeted 
mutagenesis to knock out (KO) the MsexOrco gene to test the consequences of a 
loss of OR-mediated olfaction in an insect-plant relationship. 
Neurophysiological characterization revealed severely reduced antennal and 
antennal lobe responses to representative odorants emitted by D. wrightii In a 
wind-tunnel setting with a flowering plant, Orco KO hawkmoths showed disrupted 
flight orientation and an ablated proboscis extension response to the natural 
stimulus. The Orco KO gravid female displayed reduced attraction toward a 
nonflowering plant. However, more than half of hawkmoths were able to use 
characteristic odor-directed flight orientation and oviposit on the host plant. 
Overall, OR-mediated olfaction is essential for foraging and pollination 
behaviors, but plant-seeking and oviposition behaviors are sustained through 
additional OR-independent sensory cues.

Patients with stage I testicular germ cell tumors have a long life expectancy, 
but the tumors have a potential to relapse after treatment. Although relapse is 
observed within a few years in most cases, late relapse over 10 years after 
initial treatment has also been reported in patients with stage I testicular 
germ cell tumors. We encountered a case of testicular seminoma that developed 
mediastinal lymph node metastasis 13 years after radical surgery for the primary 
tumor. The relapsed disease progressed rapidly and the patient died within 1 
month due to respiratory failure without any chance for therapy. On postmortem 
examination, the thoracic lesions were pathologically confirmed to be metastases 
from the testicular seminoma with yolk sac tumor. Here, we report the clinical 
course and a review of the relevant literature. Based on our experience, we 
emphasize long-term follow-up and/or careful examination in patients with stage 
I testicular germ cell tumors.

OBJECTIVES: Developments in medical technology have increased life expectancy 
around the world thereby, the population of elderly patients increases. While 
diagnosing the elderly patients, besides factors like physiological changes, 
comorbidities, multiple medications and admittance to the Emergency Department 
(ED) for serious causes, a lack of information and experience complicate the 
work of emergency physicians. Elderly people are admitted to ED with medical or 
traumatic complaints; nevertheless, independent of the reason for admittance to 
the ED their presenting condition should be simultaneously assessed for 
comorbidities. In this study, we aimed to compare social support and stress 
levels in geriatric patients admitted to the ED for trauma and medical reasons.
METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, descriptive, epidemiologic trial 
conducted in the ED of a training and research hospital between October 1st, 
2015, and April 1st, 2016. Participants consisted 197 patients who were older 
than 65 years and presented to ED with medical reasons or trauma whose Emergency 
Severity Index (ESI) was ≥3. A socio-demographic and clinical data form, and the 
DUKE Social Support and Stress Scale (DUSOCS) were completed for each patient.
RESULTS: Patients presenting with medical problems had higher family support 
levels than patients presenting with traumatic incidents, and this difference 
was statistically significant (p = 0.028). Concurrently, when both groups' 
family stress and social stress levels are viewed, patients presenting with 
trauma had higher levels of stress, and this difference was also statistically 
significant (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the patients admitted to the ED for trauma 
have lower social support levels than patients admitted for medical reasons. 
Moreover, social stress levels were also higher in these patients.

PURPOSE: Optimal efficacy of a macromolecular prodrug requires balancing the 
rate of drug release with the rate of prodrug elimination. Since circulating 
macromolecules have different elimination rates in different species, a prodrug 
optimal for one species will likely not be for another. The objectives of this 
work were (a) to develop an approach to optimize pharmacokinetics of a PEG~SN-38 
prodrug in a particular species, (b) to use the approach to predict the 
pharmacokinetics of various prodrugs of SN-38 in the mouse and human, and (c) to 
develop a PEG~SN-38 conjugate that is optimized for mouse tumor models.
METHODS: We developed models that describe the pharmacokinetics of a drug 
released from a prodrug by the relationship between the rates of drug release 
and elimination of the prodrug. We tested the model by varying the release rate 
of SN-38 from PEG~SN-38 conjugates in the setting of a constant prodrug 
elimination rate in the mouse. Finally, we tested the antitumor efficacy of a 
PEG~SN-38 optimized for the mouse.
RESULTS: Optimization of a PEG~SN-38 prodrug was achieved by adjusting the rate 
of SN-38 release such that the ratio of t1/2,β of released SN-38 to the t1/2 of 
prodrug elimination was 0.2-0.8. Using this approach, we could rationalize the 
efficacy of previous PEGylated SN-38 prodrugs in the mouse and human. Finally, a 
mouse-optimized PEG~SN-38 showed remarkable antitumor activity in 
BRCA1-deficient MX-1 xenografts; a single dose gave tumor regression, 
suppression, and shrinkage of massive tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of a macromolecular prodrug can be optimized for a 
given species by balancing the rate of drug release from the carrier with the 
rate of prodrug elimination.

BACKGROUND: Due to the long life expectancy, retinal detachment is a special 
threat to visual acuity in children and adolescents. This study presents the 
clinical features of retinal detachment in childhood and adolescence up to the 
age of 20 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort was selected comprising 259 patients who suffered 
from unilateral or bilateral retinal detachment, were not older than 20 years of 
age at the first diagnosis of the first or only affected eye and had undergone 
surgery at least once at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University 
Medical Center of Munich during a period of 18 years (1980-1998). This patient 
collective was retrospectively analyzed with respect to the clinical features of 
the first retinal detachment. The group consisting of only one affected eye or 
the first affected eye (259 eyes) was included. The fellow eyes affected later 
were excluded (19 eyes).
RESULTS: The time period between the first visual symptoms and the diagnosis of 
retinal detachment was on average 9.6 weeks and the most commonly manifested 
symptom was loss of vision (36.3% of patients). In 40.2% of the patients the 
detachment was discovered fortuitously. The most frequent presentation (34.0%) 
was a 2-quadrant retinal detachment and was (sub)total in 27.0% of eyes. Macular 
detachment was found in 154 eyes (59.5%). The commonest type of retinal break 
was a tear near the ora serrata (36.1% of all breaks). Giant tears (12.8% of all 
breaks) occurred preferentially in the area of the ora serrata, round atrophic 
holes were identified especially in the area of the equator, often in the form 
of a chain of holes. Breaks most frequently occurred in the inferior temporal 
quadrant. In 22.4% of retinal detachments no break was found even 
intraoperatively. A primary proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) of at least 
stage C was involved in 25.5% of detachments.
CONCLUSION: In childhood and adolescence a characteristic delay of diagnosis 
enables a large sized expansion of the retinal detachment with frequent macular 
involvement and a high proportion with (sub)total detachment and severe primary 
PVR. Tears in the ora serrata area, giant tears, multiple round atrophic holes 
in the area of the equator and a high rate of undetectable breaks are the 
intrinsic characteristics of juvenile retinal detachment.

Self-management schemes and mobile apps can be used for the management of 
hypertension in the community, but the most appropriate patient population is 
unknown. To explore whether the Chinese Health Literacy Scale (CHLSH) can be 
used to screen for appropriate patients with hypertension for self-management 
and to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and health economic evaluation of 
three hypertension management schemes. This was a prospective study performed 
from March 2017 to July 2017 in consecutive patients with primary hypertension 
and of 50-80 years of age from the Jinyang community, Wuhou District, Chengdu. 
The CHLSH was completed and the patients were classified into the high (n = 283) 
and low (n = 315) health literacy groups. The patients were randomly divided 
into the self-management, traditional management, and mobile app management 
groups. The high-health literacy group was selected to construct the 
cost-effectiveness decision tree model. Blood pressure control rate and the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined. At the end of follow-up, 
the success rate of self-management was 83.4%. The costs for 6 months of 
treatment for each patient with hypertension in the self-management, traditional 
management, and mobile app groups were 1266, 1751, and 1856 yuan, respectively. 
The costs required for obtaining 1 QALY when managing for 6 months were: 30,869 
yuan for self-management; 48,628 yuan for traditional management; and 43,199 
yuan for the mobile app. The CHLSH can be used as a tool for screening patients 
with hypertension for self-management. The cost-effectiveness of self-management 
was optimal.
