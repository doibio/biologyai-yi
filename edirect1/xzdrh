INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have shown that hypnotherapy (HT) is effective in 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using traditional symptom severity end points. 
However, there is now interest in capturing the patient's perception of their 
illness and treatment because what patients expect from their treatment may 
differ from that of their healthcare provider.
OBJECTIVE: To record patient perceptions and expectations of hypnotherapy as 
well as their symptom response.
METHODS: 150 consecutive IBS patients (116 females, 34 males, aged 16-81 years) 
receiving hypnotherapy completed questionnaires recording IBS symptom severity, 
quality of life, noncolonic symptoms, anxiety and depression levels before and 
after treatment. Their expectations and perceptions of HT were also recorded, 
including a free text reflection.
RESULTS: 121 patients (81%) responded to treatment consistent with our previous 
experience. Symptom severity scores, noncolonic symptoms, quality of life, 
anxiety and depression significantly all improved after HT (p < 0.001). 
Expectancy of an improvement with hypnotherapy was greater in those who did not 
respond to treatment (63%) than those who did (57%, p < 0.001). Scepticism and 
apprehension were common before treatment and replaced with enthusiasm 
afterwards. Free text responses after treatment were overwhelmingly positive. 
Patients also reported a variety of other benefits and even 20 of 29 symptom 
nonresponders (70%) still considered treatment worthwhile.
CONCLUSION: Although initially perceived negatively, hypnotherapy improved 
symptoms and resulted in a wide range of additional benefits. Expectation did 
not necessarily influence outcome. Recording IBS symptoms alone does not fully 
capture the patient's experience of treatment and needs to be considered in 
future research.

Lack of awareness of a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients and 
physicians is a major contributor to fueling the CKD pandemic by also making it 
invisible to researchers and health authorities. This is an urgent matter to 
tackle if dire predictions of future CKD burden are to be addressed. CKD is set 
to become the fifth-leading global cause of death by 2040 and the second-leading 
cause of death before the end of the century in some countries with long life 
expectancy. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illustrated this invisibility: 
only after the summer of 2020 did it become clear that CKD was a major driver of 
COVID-19 mortality, both in terms of prevalence as a risk factor and of the risk 
conferred for lethal COVID-19. However, by that time the damage was done: news 
outlets and scientific publications continued to list diabetes and hypertension, 
but not CKD, as major risk factors for severe COVID-19. In a shocking recent 
example from Sweden, CKD was found to be diagnosed in just 23% of 57 880 persons 
who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for CKD. In the very same large cohort, 
diabetes or cancer were diagnosed in 29% of persons, hypertension in 82%, 
cardiovascular disease in 39% and heart failure in 28%. Thus, from the point of 
view of physicians, patients and health authorities, CKD was the least common 
comorbidity in persons with CKD, ranking sixth, after other better-known 
conditions. One of the consequences of this lack of awareness was that 
nephrotoxic medications were more commonly prescribed in patients with CKD who 
did not have a diagnosis of CKD. Low awareness of CKD may also fuel concepts 
such as the high prevalence of hypertensive nephropathy when CKD is diagnosed 
after the better-known condition of hypertension.

Countries around the world are presently confronted with gargantuan health care 
challenges and huge variability in health spending. In the literature, income 
has been recognized as a crucial predictor of health expenditure. However, there 
is no agreement on which other variables may be connected to the remaining 
largely unexplained variation in health expenditure. Therefore, the aim of the 
present study was to investigate the link between health expenditure and some 
important predictors among low-income and lower middle-income economies. 
Regularized regression methods including the Lasso and the Elastic net, and the 
2013 World Bank data were used to identify key predictors of health expenditure. 
The present study showed that the Elastic net algorithm produced a model with a 
better predictive power than the Lasso in the case of low-income economies. 
However, the Lasso produced a slightly superior predictive power compared to the 
Elastic net in the case of lower middle-income economies. Also, income remains a 
common predictor of health expenditure in both economies. Findings of the study 
would be valuable to governments seeking to lessen the impact of vast 
variability in health care spending on their economies by focusing on key 
predictors of health expenditure per capita, such as life expectancy and 
population density.

Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease of public health 
concern. Improved quality healthcare has increased the life expectancy of these 
patients; however, they also face an increased frequency of vaso-occlusive 
crises and other SCD complications. These complications affect their quality of 
life, an area of care, which healthcare providers often overlook. We sought to 
determine the health-related quality of life among patients living with sickle 
cell disease in Lagos, Nigeria.  Materials and methods We conducted a 
cross-sectional study of 198 patients with sickle cell disease who attended the 
adult sickle cell clinic at a tertiary hospital in Lagos, Nigeria, during the 
period from October 1, 2018, to February 28, 2019. A self-administered 
questionnaire was used to obtain the clinical and socio-demographic 
characteristics of the patients and the 35-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
questionnaire was used to determine their health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL). Determinants of HRQoL were established using bivariate and multivariate 
regression analysis.  Results The mean age of the 198 patients who participated 
in the study was 28.4±9.1 years, mean steady-state hemoglobin was 8.2 ± 1.3 
g/dl, and 85 (42.9%) patients had a monthly income of 150 USD or less. In the 
previous year, 65 (32.1 %) and 33 (16.6%) patients, respectively, suffered one 
to two episodes (s) of acute bone pain crises and acute chest syndrome, and 43 
(24.7%) had blood transfusion. Using the scoring system for SF-36 provided by 
RAND Health, role limitation due to physical health had the lowest median score 
of 50 (interquartile range {IQR}: 0-100). On bivariate analysis, bone pain 
crisis was associated with statistically significant low scores across all the 8 
HRQoL domains of the SF36 questionnaire. Other variables, including having 
received blood transfusion, recent hospitalization, acute chest syndrome, lower 
level of income, and younger age, were also associated with significantly low 
scores. On regression analysis, bone pain crisis, level of income, and acute 
chest syndrome were found to be independent determinants of quality of life in 
the patients. Conclusion Sickle cell disease has a negative impact on the 
health-related quality of life of those affected. The presence of bone pain 
crisis is an important predictor of health-related quality of life in sickle 
cell disease patients. To improve patient outcomes, healthcare providers should 
take a holistic approach in evaluating and managing this disease, taking into 
cognizance how the complications and the financial burden of this disease impact 
the quality of life of affected patients.

BACKGROUND: With the rise in human life expectancy, the prevalence of chronic 
disease has increased significantly. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can decrease 
the risk of chronic disease. Virtual coaching systems can help older adults 
adopt a healthy lifestyle.AimThe primary objective of this study was to assess 
the use, user experience and potential health effects of a conversational 
agent-based eHealth platform (Council of Coaches) implemented in a real-world 
setting among older adults.
METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted with older adults aged 
55 years or older in the Netherlands. Participants were enrolled for 5-9 weeks 
during which they had access to Council of Coaches. They completed three 
questionnaires: pre-test, post-test, and at follow-up. After five weeks, an 
interview was conducted, and participants chose whether they wanted to use the 
eHealth intervention for another four weeks during the facultative phase.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 51 older adults (70.6% female) with a 
mean age of 65.3 years (SD = 7.4). Of these, 94.1% started interacting with 
Council of Coaches, and most participants interacted once per week. During the 
facultative phase, 21 participants were still interacting with Council of 
Coaches. Minimal clinical important differences in quality of life were found 
among the study population after interacting with Council of Coaches.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that eHealth interventions with virtual 
coaching can be used among older adults. This may increase quality of life for 
older adults, and decrease their healthcare needs. Future research into such 
eHealth interventions should take into account the inclusion of sufficient 
personalised content and the use of a mixed methods study for assessing the 
eHealth intervention.

Fresh tomato juice was processed by hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) at 5 to 15 psi 
pressures for 5-30 min. A full factorial design was applied to optimize the HC 
treatment of tomato juice quality. Optimal conditions were recorded at 10 psi 
for 10 min, which showed no significant (p < 0.05) change in lycopene content to 
that of freshly obtained unprocessed tomato juice (control). After processing, 
the retention of 93% ascorbic acid and 96.6% of total phenolic compounds (TPC) 
was observed. Similarly, sedimentation and viscosity were mildly affected by HC 
processing (89.2 and 94.4% of values in the treated sample, respectively). While 
pH, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) of HC treated sample 
remained unchanged (p < 0.05). The results were also compared with the 
conventional thermally processed tomato juice (90 °C for 90 s). Although thermal 
treatment resulted in the inactivation of 92.2% of pectin methylesterase and a 5 
log reduction in total plate counts, it also showed significant reductions in 
ascorbic acid (61.4%), TPC (72.3%), and physical properties (37.7% of SI and 
83.2% viscosity). However, HC processing could achieve a maximum of 4.9% 
inactivation of PME and 1 log reduction at high treatment conditions, 
respectively (15 psi for 30 min). The shelf-life study showed more retention of 
bioactives and better physicochemical properties in tomato juice samples stored 
at 4 °C for 15 days than the control. Sensory evaluation revealed that the 
overall acceptability of the optimized HC treated (0.714) sample was better than 
the thermally treated sample (0.591). The observed results concluded that 
HC-treated tomato juice was comparatively better than thermally-treated tomato 
juice in retaining bioactive compounds. Consequently, HC constitutes a promising 
approach in food processing to improve and retain the beneficial properties of 
tomato juice.

PURPOSE: Cardiometabolic disease in patients with severe mental illness is a 
major cause of shortened life expectancy. There is sparse evidence of real-world 
clinical risk prevention practice. We investigated levels of assessments of 
cardiometabolic risk factors and risk management interventions in patients with 
severe mental illness in the Norwegian mental health service according to an 
acknowledged international standard.
METHODS: We collected data from 264 patients residing in six country-wide health 
trusts for: (a) assessments of cardiometabolic risk and (b) assessments of 
levels of risk reducing interventions. Logistic regressions were employed to 
investigate associations between risk and interventions.
RESULTS: Complete assessments of all cardiometabolic risk variables were 
performed in 50% of the participants and 88% thereof had risk levels requiring 
intervention according to the standard. Smoking cessation advice was provided to 
45% of daily smokers and 4% were referred to an intervention program. Obesity 
was identified in 62% and was associated with lifestyle interventions. 
Reassessment of psychotropic medication was done in 28% of the obese patients. 
Women with obesity were less likely to receive dietary advice, and use of 
clozapine or olanzapine reduced the chances for patients with obesity of getting 
weight reducing interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly nine out of the ten participants were identified as being at 
cardiometabolic high risk and only half of the participants were adequately 
screened. Women with obesity and patients using antipsychotics with higher 
levels of cardiometabolic side effects had fewer adequate interventions. The 
findings underscore the need for standardized recommendations for identification 
and provision of cardiometabolic risk reducing interventions in all patients 
with severe mental illness.

New drugs are expensive, in part due to excessive drug development costs. 
Governments are trying to reduce drug prices. This can delay access to effective 
agents. A country's access to new drugs correlates with prices they agree to 
pay. After Health Canada approves a drug, the Canadian Agency for Drug and 
Technologies in Health (CADTH) assesses it. CADTH's approval is usually 
contingent on it costing ≤CAD 50,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained. This value (unchanged from the 1970s) is inappropriately low. An 
inflation-adjusted CAD 50,000 1975 QALY should translate into a CAD 250,000 2021 
QALY. CADTH's target also does not consider that drug development costs have 
risen much faster than inflation or that new precision therapies may only be 
used in small populations. In a separate process, proposals from the Patented 
Medicines Price Review Board (PMPRB) would decrease initial Canadian drug prices 
by 20%, but prices would fall further as sales increased, with ultimate price 
reductions of up to 80%. PMPRB claims its proposal would not reduce drug access, 
but multiple analyses strongly suggest otherwise. Government price controls 
target the symptom (high prices), not the disease. They translate into shortages 
without solving the problem. CADTH and PMPRB approaches both threaten access to 
effective drugs.

Longer life expectancy has led to an increase in efforts directed to the 
discovery of new healing agents for disorders related to aging, such as bone 
diseases. Harboring an incredible variety of bioactive metabolites, marine 
organisms are standing out as fruitful sources also in this therapeutic field. 
On the other hand, the in vivo zebrafish model has proven to be an excellent 
low-cost screening platform for the fast identification of molecules able to 
regulate bone development. By using zebrafish larvae as a mineralization model, 
we have thus evaluated the effects of the crude acetonic extract from the marine 
sponge Aplysina aerophoba and its bromotyrosine components on bone development. 
Obtained results led to the selection of aerophobin-1 (1) as a promising 
candidate for applications in regenerative medicine, paving the way for the 
development of a novel therapeutic option in osteoporosis treatment.

IMPORTANCE: The initial assessment of pertuzumab use for treatment of metastatic 
breast cancer by health technology assessment agencies suggested that pertuzumab 
was not cost-effective. In Ontario, Canada, pertuzumab became funded in November 
2013 based on the substantial clinical benefit. To date, there is a paucity of 
analysis of pertuzumab using real-world data for cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and 
chemotherapy vs trastuzumab and chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast 
cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based retrospective economic 
evaluation was conducted in Ontario, Canada. Patients who received first-line 
treatments for metastatic breast cancer from January 1, 2008, to March 31, 2018, 
were identified. Patients were followed up from the start of treatment up to 5 
years, with maximum follow-up to March 31, 2019. Patients were identified from 
the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked to the New Drug Funding Program database 
to identify receipt of first-line treatment (N = 1158).
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy after 
public funding (November 25, 2013) compared with treatment with trastuzumab and 
chemotherapy before funding.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness, from a public payer perspective, 
was estimated from administrative data with a 5-year time horizon, adjusted for 
censoring, and discounted (1.5%). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 
life-years gained and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with bootstrapped 95% 
CIs were calculated. Sensitivity analysis with price reduction of pertuzumab 
alone or in combination with trastuzumab was conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 579 pairs of matched patients receiving pertuzumab and 
controls were included. The mean (SD) age of the matched study cohort was 58 
(12.97) years; 1151 were women (99.4%). Pertuzumab resulted in 0.61 life-years 
gained and 0.44 QALYs gained at an incremental cost of $192 139 (all costs 
measured in Canadian dollar values, CAD) with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $316 203 per life-year gained and $436 679 per QALY. The main factors 
associated with cost included the cost of pertuzumab (60%), outpatient cancer 
treatment delivery (24%), and trastuzumab (15%). With 100% price reduction of 
pertuzumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $174 027 per QALY. When 
the price of pertuzumab and trastuzumab were both reduced by more than 71%, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased below $100 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this population-based study suggest 
that pertuzumab may increase survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer 
but would not be considered cost-effective, even after 100% price reduction, 
under conventional thresholds.

INTRODUCTION: Men who receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate 
cancer (PCa) are a vulnerable falls population due to the side effects of 
treatment. The purpose of this paper is to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
exercise in preventing falls and fractures for this high-risk population in 
Australia.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate the cost utility 
of an exercise intervention compared to usual care from a health system 
perspective. The intervention comprised two 1-h sessions of supervised exercise 
per week over 1 year for men with non-metastatic PCa receiving curative 
radiation therapy and ADT. A Markov model simulated the transition between five 
health states: (1) at risk of falling; (2) at recurrent risk of falling; (3) 
fracture (minor or major); (4) non-fracture injury (minor or major); and (5) 
death. Model inputs including transition probabilities and utility scores were 
obtained from published meta-analyses, and costs were drawn from Australian data 
sources (e.g. Medical Benefits Schedule). The model time horizon was 3 years, 
and costs and effects were discounted at 5% annual rate. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were aggregated and compared between the 
intervention and control to calculate incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB). 
Uncertainty in the results was explored using deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay of AU$50,000 per QALY, the exercise 
intervention dominated, as it was less costly and more effective than usual 
care. The iNMB was $3010 per patient. The PSA showed a 58% probability the 
intervention was cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: This is the first modelled economic evaluation of exercise for men 
with PCa. Our results suggest supervised exercise is cost-effective in reducing 
the risks of falls and fractures in this population.

Cancer cachexia and the associated skeletal muscle wasting are considered poor 
prognostic factors, although effective treatment has not yet been established. 
Recent studies have indicated that the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle loss may 
involve dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the accompanying chronic 
inflammation or altered metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the possible 
effects of modifying the gut microenvironment with partially hydrolyzed guar gum 
(PHGG), a soluble dietary fiber, on cancer-related muscle wasting and its 
mechanism using a colon-26 murine cachexia model. Compared with a fiber-free 
(FF) diet, PHGG contained fiber-rich (FR) diet-attenuated skeletal muscle loss 
in cachectic mice by suppressing the elevation of the major muscle-specific 
ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, as well as the autophagy markers LC3 and 
Bnip3. Although tight-junction markers were partially reduced in both FR and FF 
diet-fed cachectic mice, the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and 
unclassified S24-7 family increased by FR diet, contributing to the retention of 
the colonic mucus layer. The reinforcement of the gut barrier function resulted 
in the controlled entry of pathogens into the host system and reduced 
circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and IL-6, which 
in turn led to the suppression of proteolysis by downregulating the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathway. These results suggest that 
dietary fiber may have the potential to alleviate skeletal muscle loss in cancer 
cachexia, providing new insights for developing effective strategies in the 
future.

COVID-19 Pneumonia and Lung Cancer: A Challenge for the RadiologistReview of the 
Main Radiological Features, Differential Diagnosis and Overlapping Pathologies.

The COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic represents the most severe health emergency of 
the 21st century and has been monopolizing health systems' economic and human 
resources world-wide. Cancer patients have been suffering from the health 
systems' COVID-19 priority management with evidence of late diagnosis leading to 
patients' poor prognosis and late medical treatment. The radiologist plays a 
pivotal role as CT represents a non-invasive radiological technique which may 
help to identify possible overlap and differential diagnosis between COVID-19 
pneumonia and lung cancer, which represents the most frequent cancer histology 
in COVID-19 patients. Our aims are: to present the main CT features of COVID-19 
pneumonia; to provide the main differential diagnosis with lung cancer, 
chemotherapy-, immunotherapy-, and radiotherapy-induced lung disease; and to 
suggest practical tips and key radiological elements to identify possible 
overlap between COVID-19 pneumonia and lung cancer. Despite similarities or 
overlapping findings, the combination of clinics and some specific radiological 
findings, which are also identified by comparison with previous and follow-up CT 
scans, may guide differential diagnosis. It is crucial to search for typical 
COVID-19 pneumonia phase progression and typical radiological features on HRTC. 
The evidence of atypical findings such as lymphadenopathies and mediastinal and 
vessel invasion, as well as the absence of response to therapy, should arouse 
the suspicion of lung cancer and require contrast administration. Ground-glass 
areas and/or consolidations bound to radiotherapy fields or pneumonitis arising 
during and after oncological therapy should always arouse the suspicion of 
radiation-induced lung disease and chemo/immunotherapy-induced lung disease. The 
radiological elements we suggest for COVID-19 and lung cancer differential 
diagnosis may be used to develop AI protocols to guarantee an early and proper 
diagnosis and treatment to improve patients' quality of life and life 
expectancy.

Melanocytic neoplasia is the most common form of ocular tumour in cats, 
accounting for 67% of cases in an analysis of 2614 cases of primary ocular 
neoplasia. Feline diffuse iris melanoma (FDIM) is by far the most common form of 
ocular melanocytic neoplasia, with limbal melanomas and atypical melanoma 
(melanoma affecting the choroid or ciliary body) infrequently recognised. Early 
lesions begin as flat areas of pigmentation of the iris, known as iris 
melanosis. This melanosis is a precursor lesion that can become FDIM when 
pigmented cells infiltrate the anterior iris stroma, commonly alongside a 
transition in cell morphology. The differentiation between FDIM and benign iris 
melanosis is only recognisable though histologic examination, with no in vivo 
means of identifying the malignant transformation. The behaviour of FDIM is 
variable and difficult to predict. Some FDIM lesions have a more benign 
progression and can slowly grow or remain static for years without affecting the 
ocular or systemic health of the individual, whilst other tumours behave 
aggressively, invading the ocular structures and significantly affecting the 
life expectancy of cats through metastatic disease. This makes management and 
timely enucleation of these cases challenging in practice. This article aims to 
review our current knowledge of FDIM.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also referred to as 
Ehlers-Danlos Type IV is an uncommon autosomal dominant genetic disorder linked 
to connective tissue abnormality. Its evolution is marked by the occurrence of 
severe vascular, digestive and obstetrical complications. The current case 
highlights the importance of early diagnosis and physician awareness about this 
disorder as it can improve the patient's prognosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 34-year-old woman, who presented at 
36 weeks of amenorrhea with labor pain. The labor evolution was marked by an 
increased fluctuating abdominal pain, a sudden loss of the fetal station 
detected during cervical examination and decelerations to 60 beats per min, 
leading to an emergency caesarean section. During the laparotomy, the patient 
presented a spontaneous bilateral extension of the cutaneous incision requiring 
the realization of stopping stitches. The fetus and placenta had been expelled 
via a 9 cm long uterine wall rupture also known as an open book uterine rupture. 
A live male infant weighting 2890 g was promptly delivered and transported to 
NICU for respiratory distress. Physical features typical of EDS-IV allowed us to 
suspect this disorder and genetic analysis identified the presence of COL3A1 
gene mutation, confirming the diagnosis.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome is of paramount importance to improve the prognosis of affected 
patients, who often present themselves with life-threatening situations. 
Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for the clinical signs of 
this inherited connective tissue disorder that is characterized by distinctive 
features.

Surgical Management of Valvular Heart Disease in Mucopolysaccharidoses: A Review 
of Literature.

Mucopolysaccharidoses are extremely rare diseases that are frequently presenting 
with structural heart problems of the aortic and mitral valve in combination 
with myocardial dysfunction. In a substantial proportion, this leads to heart 
failure and is a leading cause of death in these patients. As this 
glycosaminoglycan degradation defect is associated with other conditions 
strongly influencing the perioperative risk and choice of surgical technique, 
multidisciplinary planning is crucial to improve short- and long-term outcomes. 
The extensive variance in clinical presentation between different impaired 
enzymes, and further within subgroups, calls for personalised treatment plans. 
Enzyme replacement therapies and bone marrow transplantation carry great 
potential as they may significantly abrogate the progress of the disease and as 
such reduce the clinical burden and improve life expectancy. Nevertheless, 
structural heart interventions may be required. We reviewed the existing 
literature of the less than 50 published cases regarding surgical management, 
technique, and choice of prostheses. Although improvement in therapy has shown 
promising results in protecting valvar tissue when initiated in infancy, 
concerns regarding stability of this effect and durability of biological 
prostheses remain.

Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a heterogeneous group of congenital neuromuscular 
disorders whose clinical signs include myalgia, skeletal muscle weakness, 
hypotonia, and atrophy that leads to progressive muscle disability and loss of 
ambulation. MDs can also affect cardiac and respiratory muscles, impairing 
life-expectancy. MDs in clude Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss 
muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle 
muscular dystrophy. These and other MDs are caused by mutations in genes that 
encode proteins responsible for the structure and function of skeletal muscles, 
such as components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex that connect the 
sarcomeric-actin with the extracellular matrix, allowing contractile force 
transmission and providing stability during muscle contraction. Consequently, in 
dystrophic conditions in which such proteins are affected, muscle integrity is 
disrupted, leading to local inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, 
Ca2+-dyshomeostasis and muscle degeneration. In this scenario, dysregulation of 
connexin hemichannels seem to be an early disruptor of the homeostasis that 
further plays a relevant role in these processes. The interaction between all 
these elements constitutes a positive feedback loop that contributes to the 
worsening of the diseases. Thus, we discuss here the interplay between 
inflammation, oxidative stress and connexin hemichannels in the progression of 
MDs and their potential as therapeutic targets.

The risk of the development of tendon disorders or ruptures increases with age, 
but it is unclear whether intrinsic fitness during lifetime might also affect 
tendon properties. To investigate this, a contrasting rat model of high-capacity 
runners (HCR with high intrinsic fitness) and low-capacity runners (LCR with low 
intrinsic fitness) was employed. Histological and molecular changes in rotator 
cuff (RC) tendons from 10 weeks old (young; HCR-10 and LCR-10) and 100 weeks old 
(old; HCR-100 and LCR-100) female rats were investigated. Age-dependent changes 
of RC tendons observed in HCR and LCR were increase of weight, decrease of 
tenocytes and RNA content, reduction of the wavy pattern of collagen and elastic 
fibers, repressed expression of Col1a1, Eln, Postn, Tnmd, Tgfb3 and Egr1 and 
reduction of the Col1:Col3 and Col1:Eln ratio. The LCR rats showed less physical 
activity, increased body weight, signs of metabolic disease and a reduced life 
expectancy. Their RC tendons revealed increased weight (more than age-dependent) 
and enlargement of the tenocyte nuclei (consistent with degenerative tendons). 
Low intrinsic fitness led to repressed expression of a further nine genes 
(Col3a1, Fbn1, Dcn, Tnc, Scx, Mkx, Bmp1, Tgfb1, Esr1) as well as the rise of the 
Col1:Col3 and Col1:Eln ratios (related to the lesser expression of Col3a1 and 
Eln). The intrinsic fitness influences the female RC tendons at least as much as 
age. Lower intrinsic fitness accelerates aging of RC tendons and leads to 
further impairment; this could result in decreased healing potential and 
elasticity and increased stiffness.

The number of paediatric patients living with a prolonged Disorder of 
Consciousness (DoC) is growing in high-income countries, thanks to substantial 
improvement in intensive care. Life expectancy is extending due to the clinical 
and nursing management achievements of chronic phase needs, including 
infections. However, long-known pharmacological therapies such as amantadine and 
zolpidem, as well as novel instrumental approaches using direct current 
stimulation and, more recently, stem cell transplantation, are applied in the 
absence of large paediatric clinical trials and rigorous age-balanced and 
dose-escalated validations. With evidence building up mainly through case 
reports and observational studies, there is a need for well-designed paediatric 
clinical trials and specific research on 0-4-year-old children. At such an early 
age, assessing residual and recovered abilities is most challenging due to the 
early developmental stage, incompletely learnt motor and cognitive skills, and 
unreliable communication; treatment options are also less explored in early age. 
In middle-income countries, the lack of rehabilitation services and 
professionals focusing on paediatric age hampers the overall good assistance 
provision. Young and fast-evolving health insurance systems prevent universal 
access to chronic care in some countries. In low-income countries, rescue 
networks are often inadequate, and there is a lack of specialised and intensive 
care, difficulty in providing specific pharmaceuticals, and lower compliance to 
intensive care hygiene standards. Despite this, paediatric cases with DoC are 
reported, albeit in fewer numbers than in countries with better-resourced 
healthcare systems. For patients with a poor prospect of recovery, withdrawal of 
care is inhomogeneous across countries and still heavily conditioned by 
treatment costs as well as ethical and cultural factors, rather than reliant on 
protocols for assessment and standardised treatments. In summary, there is a 
strong call for multicentric, international, and global health initiatives on 
DoC to devote resources to the paediatric age, as there is now scope for funders 
to invest in themes specific to DoC affecting the early years of the life 
course.

Despite the great advances in medicine, mortality from cardiovascular diseases 
keeps on growing. This tendency is not likely to change considering the pandemic 
proportions of obesity and diabetes. Besides, the global population is more aged 
as life expectancy increases, and vascular aging plays a key role in the 
increased risk of vascular disease. In light of recent trials, namely the CANTOS 
study, showing the enormous potential of anti-inflammatory therapies and in 
particular those targeted to IL-1β, a change in therapeutical management of 
cardiovascular diseases is coming about. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a 
multiprotein complex that assembles to engage the innate immune defense by 
processing the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. 
Substantial evidence has positioned the NLRP3 inflammasome at the center of 
vascular disease progression, with a particular significance in the context of 
aging and the low-grade chronic inflammation associated (inflammaging). 
Therefore, pharmacological blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its end 
products has arisen as an extremely promising tool to battle vascular disease. 
In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome 
contributes to vascular disease, with particular attention to the consequences 
of aging, and we enumerate the therapeutic options available to combat this 
recurrent villain.
