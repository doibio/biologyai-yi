Mechanistic understanding of the topological cues delivered by biomaterials in 
promotion of oriented tissue regeneration (e.g., peripheral nerve regrowth) 
remains largely elusive. Here, we engineered nerve conduits composed of oriented 
microfiber-bundle cores and randomly organized nanofiber sheaths to particularly 
interrogate the regulatory mechanism of microfiber orientation on promoted 
peripheral nerve regeneration. With comprehensive yet systematic analyses, we 
were able to elucidate the intricate cascade of biological responses associated 
with conduit-assisted nerve regrowth, i.e., oriented microfibers facilitated 
macrophage recruitment and subsequent polarization toward a pro-healing 
phenotype, which in turn promoted Schwann cell (SC) migration, myelinization and 
axonal extension. Pronounced improvement of nerve regeneration in rat sciatic 
nerve injury was evidenced with enhanced electrophysiologic function, sciatic 
functional index and alleviated muscle atrophy 3 months post-implantation. The 
obtained results offer essential insights on the topological regulation of 
biomaterials in functional nerve tissue regeneration via immune modulation.

RATIONALE: Cannabidiol (CBD) has been reported to attenuate stress and anxiety, 
but little is known about the extent to which such effects result from 
pharmacological versus expectancy factors.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether CBD expectancy alone could influence stress, 
anxiety, and mood, and the extent to which beliefs regarding CBD effects 
predicted these responses.
METHODS: In this randomized crossover study, 43 health adults (23 women) 
attended two experimental laboratory sessions, where they self-administered 
CBD-free hempseed oil sublingually. During one session, they were (incorrectly) 
informed that the oil contained CBD and in the other session, that the oil was 
CBD-free. Following administration, participants engaged in the Maastricht Acute 
Stress Test (MAST). Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed continuously, and 
subjective state was assessed at baseline, 90-min following oil administration, 
immediately following the MAST, and after a 10-min recovery period.
RESULTS: The CBD expectancy condition was associated with increased sedation as 
well as with changes in HRV that were consistent with heightened anticipatory 
stress regulation. Overall, there were no systematic changes in subjective 
stress, or anxiety, according to expectancy condition. However, participants who 
endorsed strong a priori beliefs that CBD has anxiolytic properties reported 
significantly diminished anxiety in the CBD expectancy condition.
CONCLUSIONS: CBD expectancy alone impacted several subjective and physiological 
responses. Additionally, expectancy-related factors were implicated in 
anxiolytic effects of CBD for those who believed it was helpful for such 
purposes, emphasizing the need to measure and control for CBD-related 
expectancies in clinical research that involves the administration of CBD.

Little is known about the discrepancies in the burden of child mental disorders 
based on differences in prevalence between populations with and without care. 
Identifying such discrepancies may help to elucidate the unmet needs related to 
child mental disorders. We compared the years lived with disability (YLD) 
between children with and without care for mental disorders using a 
representative national survey, Taiwan's National Epidemiological Study of Child 
Mental Disorders (TNESCMD), and a national health facility database, the Taiwan 
National Health Insurance Research Database (TNHIRD). The comorbidity-adjusted 
YLD rate ratio (RR) was reported to quantify the YLD discrepancy. The overall 
YLD rate for all mental disorders in the TNESCMD was 9.05 times higher than that 
in the TNHIRD with the lowest and highest YLD RRs for autism spectrum disorder 
(RR 3.51) and anxiety disorders (RR 360.00). Unlike the YLD proportion explained 
by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, the 
proportions explained by anxiety disorders and conduct disorder/oppositional 
defiant disorder relative to the total YLD were relatively lower in the TNHIRD 
than in TNESCMD and the Global Burden of Disease 2016. The discrepancies in YLD 
between populations with and without care in child mental disorders ranged 
from ± 55% to 99% and had an overall value of ± 80.1%. High YLD discrepancies in 
child mental disorders between estimates based on the general population and 
those in health facilities suggest significant unmet needs for care in child 
mental disorders and that estimates of disease burden that rely heavily on a 
single source may result in unreliable results.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests benefits of orthogeriatric co-management (OGCM) 
for hip fracture patients. Yet, evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited and 
based on small datasets. The aim of our study was to conduct an economic 
evaluation of the German OGCM for geriatric hip fracture patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on German health and 
long-term care insurance data. Individuals were 80 years and older, sustained a 
hip fracture in 2014, and were treated in hospitals providing OGCM (OGCM group) 
or standard care (control group). Health care costs from payer and societal 
perspective, life years gained (LYG) and cost-effectiveness were investigated 
within 1 year. We applied weighted gamma and two-part models, and entropy 
balancing to account for the lack of randomisation. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and employed the net-benefit approach to 
construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: 14,005 patients were treated in OGCM, and 10,512 in standard care 
hospitals. Total average health care costs per patient were higher in the OGCM 
group: €1181.53 (p < 0.001) from payer perspective, and €1408.21 (p < 0.001) 
from societal perspective. The ICER equalled €52,378.12/ LYG from payer and 
€75,703.44/ LYG from societal perspective. The probability for 
cost-effectiveness would be 95% if the willingness-to-pay was higher than 
€82,000/ LYG from payer, and €95,000/ LYG from societal perspective.
CONCLUSION: Survival improved in hospitals providing OGCM. Costs were found to 
increase, driven by inpatient and long-term care. The cost-effectiveness depends 
on the willingness-to-pay. The ICER is likely to improve with a longer 
follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Emergency interhospital transfer of patients with stroke with large 
vessel occlusion to a comprehensive stroke center for mechanical thrombectomy is 
resource-intensive and can be logistically challenging. Imaging markers may 
identify patients in whom intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone is likely to 
result in thrombus resolution, potentially rendering interhospital transfers 
unnecessary. Here, we investigate how predicted probabilities to achieve 
IVT-mediated recanalization affect cost-effectiveness estimates of interhospital 
transfer.
METHODS: We performed a health economic analysis comparing emergency 
interhospital transfer of patients with acute large vessel occlusion stroke 
after administration of IVT with a scenario in which patients also receive IVT 
but remain at the primary hospital. Results were stratified by clinical 
parameters, treatment delays, and the predicted probability to achieve 
IVT-mediated recanalization. Estimated 3-month outcomes were combined with a 
long-term probabilistic model to yield quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
costs. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Depending on input parameters, marginal costs of interhospital transfer 
ranged from USD -61 366 (cost saving) to USD +20 443 and additional QALYs gained 
from 0.1 to 3.0, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of <USD 0 
(dominant) to USD 310 000 per QALY. For some elderly patients with moderate or 
severe stroke symptoms treated in a remote primary stroke center, transfer was 
unlikely to be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 100 000 
and 50 000 per QALY (20% and 1%, respectively) if the predicted probability to 
achieve IVT-related recanalization was high. On the other hand, in some younger 
patients, the analysis yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates 
below USD 20 000 per QALY independent of the predicted recanalization rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Predicted probabilities to achieve IVT-mediated recanalization 
significantly affect the cost-effectiveness of interhospital transfer for MT, in 
particular in elderly patients with moderate or severe stroke symptoms. However, 
high predicted recanalization rates alone do not generally imply that patients 
should not be considered for transfer.

BACKGROUND: Health utilities are commonly used as quality weights to calculate 
quality-adjusted life years in cost-utility analysis (CUA). However, if 
published health utilities are not properly used, the credibility of CUA could 
be affected.
OBJECTIVES: To identify discrepancies in using published health utilities in 
CUAs for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: CVD CUAs in the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry that 
reported health utilities were included in the analysis. References cited for 
health utilities in these CUAs were reviewed to identify the original health 
utility studies. The description and value of health utilities used in the CUA 
were compared with those reported in the original utility studies. Logistic 
regression was used to identify the factors that can predict the discrepancy.
RESULTS: A total of 585 eligible CUAs published between 1977 and 2016 were 
identified and reviewed. Of these studies, 74.5% were published between 2007 and 
2016. 442 CUAs that used a total of 2235 health utilities published in 203 
original utility studies were included for the comparison. As compared with 
those utilities originally reported, only 596 (26.7%) health utilities had the 
same description and value, whereas 991 health utilities (44.3%) differed in 
both description and value. Of 1290 health utilities with a different 
description, 69.1% were due to different severity or disease. No explanation or 
justification was provided for 1171 (87.4%) of 1340 health utilities with 
different value.
CONCLUSIONS: There are concerning discrepancies in using published health 
utilities for CVD CUAs. Given the important role health utilities play in CUAs, 
authors of CUAs should always refer to the original studies for health utilities 
and be transparent about how published health utilities are selected and 
incorporated into CUAs.

BACKGROUND: The EORTC QLU-C10D is a multiattribute utility measure derived from 
the cancer-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30. The 
QLU-C10D contains 10 dimensions (physical, role, social and emotional 
functioning, pain, fatigue, sleep, appetite, nausea, bowel problems). The 
objective of this study was to develop a United States value set for the 
QLU-C10D.
METHODS: A US online panel was quota recruited to achieve a representative 
sample for sex, age (≥18 y), race, and ethnicity. Respondents undertook a 
discrete choice experiment, each completing 16 choice-pairs, randomly assigned 
from a total of 960 choice-pairs. Each pair included 2 QLU-C10D health states 
and duration. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression, 
parameterized to fit the quality-adjusted life-year framework. Utility weights 
were calculated as the ratio of each dimension-level coefficient to the 
coefficient for life expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 2480 panel members opted in, 2333 (94%) completed at least 1 
choice-pair, and 2273 (92%) completed all choice-pairs. Within dimensions, 
weights were generally monotonic. Physical functioning, role functioning, and 
pain were associated with the largest utility weights. Cancer-specific 
dimensions, such as nausea and bowel problems, were associated with moderate 
utility decrements, as were general issues such as problems with emotional 
functioning and social functioning. Sleep problems and fatigue were associated 
with smaller utility decrements. The value of the worst health state was 0.032, 
which was slightly greater than 0 (equivalent to being dead).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the US-specific value set for the QLU-C10D. 
These estimated health state scores, based on responses to the EORTC QLQ-C30 
questionnaire, can be used to evaluate the cost-utility of oncology treatments.

U.S. State Life Tables, 2018.

Arias E, Bastian B, Xu J, Tejada-Vera B.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for each of the 50 
states and the District of Columbia by sex based on age-specific death rates in 
2018. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2018 state-specific life tables include 
2018 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2018 population estimates based on the 
2010 decennial census; and 2018 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The 
methodology used to estimate the state-specific life tables is the same as that 
used to estimate the 2018 national life tables, with some modifications. 
Results-Among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Hawaii had the highest 
life expectancy at birth, 81.0 years in 2018, and West Virginia had the lowest, 
74.4 years. Life expectancy at age 65 ranged from 17.5 years in Kentucky to 21.1 
years in Hawaii. Life expectancy at birth was higher for females in all states 
and the District of Columbia. The difference in life expectancy between females 
and males ranged from 3.8 years in Utah to 6.2 years in New Mexico.

Advancements in medical science and technology, along with global increases in 
life expectancy, are changing the way health care services are delivered to the 
aging society. Telerehabilitation refers to rehabilitation services involving 
evaluation and treatment. It is an attractive option for older adults who may 
have multiple comorbidities. Limited access to in-person services and the 
concern about potential exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 during this pandemic accelerated the implementation of 
telerehabilitation. This article review the scope, need, and implementation of 
telehealth and telerehabilitation in the aging population from the perspective 
of clinicians, patients, and caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammatory processes are common in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but current 
knowledge is limited as to whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
neuroinflammatory proteins are altered in these diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize neuroinflammatory signatures in CSF from 
patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and FTD.
METHODS: We used proximity extension assay and ANOVA to measure and compare 
levels of 92 inflammatory proteins in CSF from 42 patients with AD, 29 with MCI 
due to AD (MCI/AD), 22 with stable MCI, 42 with FTD, and 49 control subjects, 
correcting for age, gender, collection unit, and multiple testing.
RESULTS: Levels of matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) were increased in AD, 
MCI/AD, and FTD compared with controls (AD: fold change [FC] = 1.32, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.53, q = 0.018; MCI/AD: FC = 1.53, 95% CI 
1.20-1.94, q = 0.045; and FTD: FC = 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.83, q = 0.020). MMP-10 
and eleven additional proteins were increased in MCI/AD, compared with MCI 
(q < 0.05). In FTD, 36 proteins were decreased, while none was decreased in AD 
or MCI/AD, compared with controls (q < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional multi-center study, we found distinct 
patterns of CSF inflammatory marker levels in FTD and in both early and 
established AD, suggesting differing neuroinflammatory processes in the two 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Protecting the health of citizens is a central aim of sustainable 
development plans, due to the effect of health on social and economic 
development. However, studies show that environment-related diseases adversely 
affect the health status of a people, and this situation is worse for African 
countries. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets have included 
reducing environment-related deaths since 2015. However, there is a lack of 
empirical findings focused on the effects of environmental quality on life 
expectancy in Africa.
OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the impact of environmental quality on 
life expectancy in 24 African countries.
METHODS: Time-series data ranging from 2000 to 2016 was used and the panel 
autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-dynamic fixed effect (DFE) model was 
employed to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The results confirmed that, in the long run, improvements in 
environmental quality significantly increased life expectancy in the studied 
African countries during the study period. A unit increment in environmental 
performance index (EPI) and ecosystem vitality (EV) increased the life 
expectancy of Africans by 0.137 and 0.1417 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical 
(econometric) study using a broad measurement (indicator) of environmental 
quality to investigate its impact on life expectancy in African countries. The 
study recommends that the introduction of environmentally friendly economies 
(like renewable energy, land, water, and waste management), legal, 
socio-economic, demographic, and technological measures are essential to reduce 
environmental pollution and improve life expectancy in Africa.

Background Increased life expectancy across the world has resulted in an 
increase in the proportion of the elderly population who are lost to heart 
diseases. Advanced age and comorbidities are believed to change the response to 
treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of surgical and 
medical treatments on the mortality of stable coronary diseases. Methods A total 
of 150 geriatric patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) were followed 
up in our cardiology clinic. Patients who decided to undergo coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) surgery after CAG and were willing to undergo the operation 
were assigned to group 1, whereas those who were unwilling to undergo the 
operation were not eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention and were 
followed up medically, and were assigned to group 2. Keeping the primary goal as 
mortality rates, both the groups were compared using medical records for three 
years after the treatment. Results After three years, the overall mortality rate 
included six patients (16%) in the CABG group versus 63 patients (55%) in the 
medical therapy group (p < 0.001). The CABG therapy was found to be 
significantly and independently associated with first- and third-year mortality 
(risk ratio: 0.064, 95% confidence interval: 0.009-0.467, p = 0.007; risk ratio: 
0.305, 95% confidence interval: 0.151-0.615, p < 0.001, respectively). 
Kaplan-Meier analysis for first- and third-year all-cause mortality rates led to 
significant results and curves between the groups. Conclusion Our study revealed 
that compared to CABG surgery in the treatment of coronary artery disease in 
geriatric patients, medical treatment is associated with poor outcomes in terms 
of mortality in long-term follow-up.

Intellectual disability (ID) encompasses a wide variety of disorders that can 
severely affect an individual's cognitive, social, emotional, and physical 
development, even when identified early in life. Initially, individuals with 
such disorders had shorter life expectancies. However, medical advances have 
increased the life expectancy of individuals with ID similar to that of the 
general population. More attention must be paid to manage diseases affecting the 
intellectually disabled elderly, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
chronic constipation, and behavioral disorders.

Osteopetrosis refers to a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by 
generalized skeletal densification due to limited bone resorption by 
osteoclasts. The infantile autosomal recessive form represents the most 
malignant one with onset early in infancy and life expectancy less than 1-2 
years without therapy. Frequently, osteopetrosis is complicated by rickets, a 
condition called osteopetrorickets. Currently, bone marrow transplantation 
remains the only treatment option. We present a case of infantile autosomal 
recessive osteopetrosis complicated by rickets in a 2 and a half-month-old 
female infant with coexistent congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, 
successfully treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
Diagnostic procedure and differential diagnosis are discussed along with a short 
review of the literature. Diagnosis of osteopetrosis requires high clinical 
suspicion, which is enhanced by radiology and confirmed by bone biopsy and 
molecular analysis. Our patient has been successfully treated by HSCT and has 
remained in a good general condition thereafter.

Optic neuropathies, including glaucoma, are a group of neurodegenerative 
diseases, characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs), leading to irreversible vision loss. While previous studies demonstrated 
the potential to replace RGCs with primary neurons from developing mouse 
retinas, their use is limited clinically. We demonstrate successful 
transplantation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cell (miPSC)/mouse embryonic 
stem cell (mESC)-derived RGCs into healthy and glaucomatous mouse retinas, at a 
success rate exceeding 65% and a donor cell survival window of up to 12 months. 
Transplanted Thy1-GFP+ RGCs were able to polarize within the host retina and 
formed axonal processes that followed host axons along the retinal surface and 
entered the optic nerve head. RNA sequencing of donor RGCs re-isolated from host 
retinas at 24 h and 1 week post-transplantation showed upregulation of cellular 
pathways mediating axonal outgrowth, extension, and guidance. Additionally, we 
provide evidence of subtype-specific diversity within miPSC-derived RGCs prior 
to transplantation.

Population aging is one of the most important social trends of the 21st century 
and in the United States, the number of people aged ≥65 is projected to increase 
by nearly 50% in the next 15 years. Most biomedical and public health efforts 
have focused on reducing harmful risk factors when targeting chronic disease-an 
approach that has contributed greatly to prevention and treatment programs. 
However, evidence suggests that the number of years lost to disability is 
increasing and historic gains we have made in life expectancy are eroding, and 
even reversing in some groups. As our society ages and grapples with these 
issues, expanding the focus to include resilience, as well as psychosocial 
assets in our prevention and treatment programs might help inform the 
multidisciplinary response effort we need. Here we synthesize research 
evaluating associations between different dimensions of psychological well-being 
(e.g., purpose in life, optimism, life satisfaction) and social well-being 
(e.g., structural, functional, quality) with chronic conditions. We also 
evaluate evidence around three biopsychosocial pathways hypothesized to underlie 
these associations. These factors are meaningful, measurable, and potentially 
modifiable; thus, further pursuing this line of inquiry might unveil innovative 
paths to enhancing the health of our rapidly aging society.

With the advent of Anti-Retroviral Therapy, Human Immune Virus, and Acquire 
Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome is increasingly becoming a chronic disease as life 
expectancy among People Living With HIV/AIDS has increased. For Children Living 
With HIV/AIDS the role of the caregivers becomes essential as caregivers' 
decisions affect CLWH health. However, the experiences of these caregivers are 
often unnoticed while all interventions are directed at PLWH. This study aimed 
at exploring the experiences of caregivers of CLWH in some selected hospitals in 
northern Ghana. This study employed a qualitative descriptive phenomenological 
approach. Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit 9 participants from 3 
public hospitals in the Tamale Metropolis of Ghana. Data was manually analyzed 
using the approach of Collaizi and the findings were presented in themes and 
sub-themes. We conducted individual face to face interviews in English and 
Dagbani from September to November 2019. These interviews were conducted at the 
convenience of the participants in hospitals and at their homes. They were 
introduced to the study while awaiting to take antivirals for their CLWH. Five 
themes emerged: changed family dynamics, discovery of diagnosis, reaction to 
diagnosis, disclosure, stigma and discrimination, and burden and challenges of 
care. Caregivers were severely impacted by caring for CLWH and traumatized by 
changed family dynamics which exposed them to many difficulties. Stigma was 
widely perpetrated by immediate family members and majority reacted badly to 
their children HIV-positive status with fear, shame, guilt and even suicidal 
ideation.

Child welfare involvement reflects childhood adversity and is associated with 
increased adult mortality, but it remains unclear how this association changes 
over the life course. Drawing on the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational 
Study (Sweden) and the National Childhood Development Study (Great Britain) this 
study examines whether inequalities within these cohorts diverge or converge. 
Involvement with child welfare services (ICWS) is divided into two levels 
('child welfare contact' and 'out-of-home care'). For each cohort, we quantify 
absolute health inequalities as differences in cumulative probabilities of death 
(18-58 years) and temporary life expectancy; and relative inequalities as hazard 
ratios in ten-year intervals and ratios of lifetime lost. Persistently, ICWS was 
associated with premature mortality. The strength of the association varied by 
age, sex and level of ICWS. Consistently across both countries, the most robust 
relationship was between out-of-home care and mortality, with statistically 
significant age-specific hazard ratios ranging between 1.8 and 3.4 for males and 
1.8-2.1 for females. Child welfare contact that did not result in out-of-home 
placement showed less consistent results. Among females the mortality gap 
developed later compared to males. Estimates attenuate after controlling for 
family socioeconomic and other background variables but patterns remain intact. 
Our results show that absolute inequalities widen with increasing age, while 
relative inequalities might peak in early adulthood and then stabilize in 
midlife. The relative disadvantage among looked-after children in early 
adulthood is heightened by overall low rates of mortality at this age. Absolute 
inequality increases with age, highlighting the weight of the accumulation of 
disadvantage in mortality over time. The bulk of excess deaths that could be 
attributed to ICWS occurs from midlife onwards. Mechanisms that uphold the 
disadvantage after childhood experiences require further exploration. This study 
highlights that the association between out-of-home care and premature mortality 
seems to transcend welfare systems.

BACKGROUND: Identifying the cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is relevant 
to optimize its management. We aimed to assess the applicability and utility of 
the Edinburgh CT criteria for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in an unselected 
cohort of hospitalized patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively applied the Edinburgh criteria to the 
first available brain CTs of patients hospitalized for a first-ever lobar ICH in 
the district of L'Aquila from 2011 to 2017. ICH characteristics and outcomes 
were compared according to the presence of the Edinburgh CT criteria, including 
associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and finger-like projections (FLPs). 
The outcome of ICH in-hospital mortality was assessed with multivariate logistic 
regression analysis. We adopted the Edinburgh criteria, age, NIHSS and Glasgow 
Coma Scale scores, systolic blood pressure, antiplatelet treatment, ICH volume, 
and intraventricular extension on admission as covariates.
RESULTS: Of 178 patients with lobar ICH, 52 (29.2%) had aSAH+FLPs, 60 (33.7%) 
aSAH only, 1 (0.6%) FLPs, and 65 (36.5%) none. Patients with aSAH+FLPs were 
older (79.0 ± 9.2 years) than those with only one criterion or none (74.0 ± 15.3 
and 72.2 ± 13.8 years, respectively; P = 0.020). Patients with aSAH+FLPs also 
had more severe ICH at onset, higher in-hospital case-fatality (log rank test 
P = 0.003) and higher mRS scores at discharge (P < 0.001) as compared to those 
fulfilling one or none of the Edinburgh criteria. Low Glasgow Coma Scale score 
was the only factor independently associated to in-hospital case-fatality (odds 
ratio per point increase 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.91; P = 0.021).
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest the applicability of the Edinburgh CT criteria in a 
hospital setting. The presence of those criteria reflects ICH clinical severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying the Edinburgh CT criteria might help refining the 
diagnosis and improving the management of patients with lobar ICH.

BACKGROUND: With the successful introduction of ART, the life expectancy of 
children living with HIV (CLHIV) is substantially increased. However, strict 
compliance is a necessary step to begin with as noncompliance is again 
associated with its own demerits of incomplete suppression and decreasing the 
overall survival of the patients.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to measure factors associated with adherence to 
ART among CLHIV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 1-year follow-up study conducted from November 
2012 to December 2013. A total of 171 children between 18 months and 15 years 
living with HIV and on ART attending the two ART centers of Delhi were enrolled 
in the study. Adherence and factors affecting adherence were obtained from the 
study participants using a semi-structured interview schedule.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Collected data were transformed into variables and 
analyzed into SPSS. All observations were in terms of mean, median, standard 
deviations, percentages, and proportions. Tests of significance such as 
Chi-square test and t-test were applied wherever required.
RESULTS: In nearly 89% of the study participants, adherence to ART was ≥95% at 
the end of the study. The most common reason for nonadherence was forgetfulness 
(59%), and 57% of the parents/caretakers were facing monetary problems. Long 
distance, greater duration to reach center, and unavailability of the 
parents/caretakers were also quoted as problems.
CONCLUSION: Adherence is genesis to successful treatment outcome and is strongly 
associated with availability of support by their parents/caretakers. 
Professional help along with guidance and encouragement is required not only at 
the caretaker level but also to the family as a whole.

Right ventricular (RV) myxoma is a very rare finding. Its differential diagnosis 
includes cardiac thrombus, and its risk of life-threatening complications 
mandates early diagnosis followed by surgical resection. We report the case of a 
patient with an incidental RV mass and a difficult differential diagnosis. A 
66-year-old woman, first assessed in neurosurgery due to a lumbar herniated 
disc, was referred to cardiology for examination before proceeding to surgery. 
She complained of dyspnea on exertion present for the last few months and 
reported no fainting or syncope. Clinical examination showed intermittent 
pulmonary systolic murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an 
oval-shaped sessile mobile mass (42∕18 mm) attached to the anterior RV wall. 
Computed tomography confirmed the presence of a RV mass with lower attenuation 
than the myocardium and extension towards the pulmonary trunk, without other 
abdominal or pulmonary masses that would suggest a thrombus. Cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging described an ovoid mass (47∕16 mm) in the right ventricle, 
"clinging" to the apical trabeculae, swinging during the cardiac cycle, causing
