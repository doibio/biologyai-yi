The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of 
rapid and accurate diagnosis, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 
has become a popular method because of its powerful amplification ability using 
a simple instrument such as a heater or water bath. However, LAMP has 
limitations such as the complexity of primer design and the difficulty of 
designing sequence-specific probes, leading to non-specific amplicons and 
false-positive results. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel 
isothermal amplification system called the Extension-mediated self-folding 
Isothermal amplification Technology (ExIT). ExIT uses a newly designed, 
self-folding primer (SP) with two key functions. Hairpin structures are formed 
when the extended strand of the SP hybridizes, exposing the priming site for 
continuous binding of the new SP. This results in exponential amplification with 
only two primers, unlike conventional LAMP primer systems. Additionally, an 
unnatural base was introduced into the SP, which terminated the extension of 
polymerase and generated a ssDNA amplicon. This makes it easier to design and 
apply probes, reducing the possibility of false-positive results even if 
non-specific amplicons are produced. Through this strategy, we confirmed a 
sensitivity of 90 copies (3.6 copies/μL) and verified the specificity by testing 
for the presence or absence of non-complementary targets. Therefore, the 
validation of the ExIT was completed. In conclusion, ExIT will be key to solving 
the complexity of conventional LAMP design and offers great potential for 
successfully introducing sequence-specific probes to improve false positives.

The increase in life expectancy combined with greater bone fragility over the 
years is causing a rise in the bone fracture cases. Femur fractures are the most 
important due to their high mortality rate. This multidisciplinary work is 
carried out in this context and focuses on the experimental reproduction of 
human femur fractures by compression. We describe a sequence of steps supervised 
by orthopaedic surgeons for the correct arrangement of specimens on the system 
set up to perform the experiment. The device applies force by compression until 
the human bone is fractured. All tests performed have been monitored and 
evaluated from different knowledge perspectives. The results obtained have 
demonstrated the repeatability of the fracture type in a controlled environment 
as well as identifying the main features involved in this process. In addition, 
the fractured bones have been digitized to analyze the fracture zone to recreate 
and evaluate future simulations.

Social frailty, along with physical and psychological frailties, is one of the 
components of frailty that has been reported to increase the incidence of 
adverse health outcomes. Although the prevalence of social frailty is relatively 
high, consensus on how to define and measure it is insufficient. In considering 
social frailty, living alone, interaction with neighbors, and social 
participation are important indicators, and interaction with neighbors and 
social participation, which are modifiable factors, are important 
countermeasures. The promotion of these social activities will contribute to 
extending healthy life expectancy-for example, by promoting physical activity. 
However, older people's physical and social activities have been severely 
constrained by the coronavirus pandemic since 2020. In the future, it will be 
necessary to fully understand the characteristics and significance of social 
frailty and develop appropriate countermeasures.

INTRODUCTION: Quality of life (QoL) greatly influences the outcomes of patients 
with mental illnesses and there is evidence that there is an association between 
QoL and the relapse of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). However, no reviews elucidate 
the relationship between QoL and the relapse of OUD. This document provides a 
scoping review protocol that aims to systematically chart and synthesise the 
published, unpublished and grey literature about the relationship between QoL 
and relapse of OUD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The enhanced six-stage methodological framework for 
scoping reviews of Arksey and O'Malley will be used. The main research question 
guiding the review will be: What is the relationship between QoL and relapse of 
OUD? Peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles, reports, and policy documents 
will be eligible to be included in the review with no limits on publication 
date. PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Scopus, OVID and Cochrane Library will 
be among the databases searched. We shall identify grey literature from Google 
Scholar, ProQuest database, Grey Source Index, Open Grey and OpenDOAR. The 
reporting of the review will follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. 
Criteria for evidence inclusion and exclusion will be used during literature 
screening and mapping.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Patients and the public will not be involved in the 
interpretations of the findings, therefore, we shall not seek approval from an 
ethics committee. Results will be disseminated through publication in a 
peer-reviewed, scientific journal, conference presentations.

Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems are the optimal source 
for data on births, deaths and causes of death for health policy, programme 
evaluation and research. In Indonesia, indicators such as life expectancy at 
birth, childhood and maternal mortality rates and cause-specific death rates 
need to be routinely monitored for national health policy. However, the CRVS 
system is not yet producing reliable vital statistics, which creates a challenge 
for evidence-based health action. In 2019, the Indonesian government released a 
national strategy for the CRVS system, with targets for improved coverage and 
data quality by 2024. This article describes findings from a programme of 
formative and implementation research to guide the application of the national 
strategy. At first, a detailed CRVS assessment and gap analysis were undertaken 
using an international framework. The assessment findings were used to develop a 
revised business process model for reporting deaths and their causes at village, 
subdistrict and district level. In addition, a field instruction manual was also 
developed to guide personnel in implementation. Two field sites in Java-Malang 
District and Kudus Regency were selected for pilot testing the reporting 
procedures, and relevant site preparation and training were carried out. Data 
compilations for Malang in 2019 and Kudus in 2020 were analysed to derive 
mortality indicators. High levels of death reporting completeness (83% to 89%) 
were reported from both districts, along with plausible cause-specific mortality 
profiles, although the latter need further validation. The study findings 
establish the feasibility of implementing revised death reporting procedures at 
the local level, as well as demonstrate sustainability through 
institutionalisation and capacity building, and can be used to accelerate 
further development of the CRVS system in Indonesia.

High BMI related burden of knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) is on a significant 
rise worldwide. OA not only causes joint pain and stiffness, but it also leads 
to disability. This study investigated the trend and burden of OA attributable 
to high body mass index (BMI) in Iran. The age-standardized disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) rates of knee and hip OA due to high BMI, were estimated 
using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019. We evaluated DALYs rate trend 
of high BMI related OA by sex and age in span of 30 years from 1990-2019 across 
the 31 provinces of Iran. The age-standardized prevalence trend of OA in the 
knee and hip showed an increase from 1990 to 2019. In 2019 there were 29.92 (95% 
CI: 10.98-64.92) and 42.50 (95% CI: 16.32-97.37) DALYs/100,000 related to OA 
from high BMI in men and women, respectively. 2019 saw the greatest 
DALYs/100,000 rate in the 65-79 age group. From 2005 to 2019, men and women saw 
DALYs/100,000 rate changes of 24.87 and 17.43 percent, respectively. The burden 
of knee OA was significantly higher than that of hip OA. DALYs rate of OA due to 
high BMI was found to be positively associated with the Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI). The burden of knee and hip OA due to high BMI has increased significantly 
in recent years in Iran among all age groups of both men and women. It is 
recommended that health policymakers develop weight control strategies to reduce 
the burden of OA and implement them at the national level.

PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the vitamin D 
supplementation program in Iranian adolescents reducing adolescent depressive 
Symptoms.
METHODS: In the current cost-effectiveness analysis, the viewpoint of Iran's 
Ministry of Health was selected. The target population was 1,519,762 Iranian 
high school students (733,657 girls and 786,105 boys). The total costs of the 
vitamin D supplementations program were based on the reports of the Nutrition 
Improvement Office of Iran's Ministry of Health and were adjusted to 2018. The 
variable of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) was considered a suitable 
variable for estimating the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation. We chose 
one year as the time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed in TreeAge 
Pro. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis were reported in term of the 
Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The results of our study showed that the estimated cost per QALY gained 
of the vitamin D supplementation program is equal to 1528.6676 $, which 
indicates that vitamin D supplementation in adolescents(11-18Y) is a 
cost-effective and a dominant strategy in preventing depression through the 
cost-saving and QALYs increment compared to the no intervention. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that the possible variations in vitamin D supplement costs could 
not alter the results, and vitamin D supplementation may be a predominant and 
cost-effective strategy to prevent adulthood depression with a 100% probability.
CONCLUSION: The national program of vitamin D supplementation among Iranian 
adolescents was a cost-efficient strategy reducing adolescent depressive 
Symptoms through the cost-saving and QALYs increment compared to the no 
intervention.

Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is a highly aggressive, fast-growing asbestos-induced 
cancer with limited effective treatments. There has been interest in using 
naturally occurring anticancer agents derived from plant materials for the 
treatment of PM. However, it is unclear if an aqueous extract from Leptospermum 
polygalifolium (QV0) has activity against PM. Here we investigated the 
anti-cancer properties of QV0 and Defender® (QV0 dietary formula) in vitro and 
in vivo, respectively. QV0 suppressed the growth of eight PM cell lines in a 
dose-dependent manner, effective at concentrations as low as 0.02% w/v 
(equivalent to 0.2 mg/ml). This response was found to be associated with 
inhibited cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation but without 
evident cell cycle alteration. We observed mitochondrial dysfunction post-QV0 
treatment, as evidenced by significantly decreased basal and maximal oxygen 
consumption rates. Ten SCID mice were treated with 0.25 mg/g Defender® daily and 
exhibited reduced tumor size over 30 days, which was associated with an average 
extension of seven days of mouse life. There was no evidence of liver toxicity 
or increased blood glucose post-treatment in animals treated with Defender®. 
Significantly enhanced tumor apoptosis was observed in the Defender®-treated 
animals, correlating to mitochondrial dysfunction. Lastly, the high levels of 
polyphenols and antioxidant properties of QV0 and Defender® were detected in 
HPLC analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this study constitutes the first 
demonstration of an improved host survival (without adverse effects) response in 
a QV0-treated PM mouse model, associated with evident inhibition of PM cell 
growth and mitochondrial dysfunction-related enhancement of tumor apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the correlation between 
human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) infection and stroke, as well as to estimate 
the global, regional, and national burden of HIV-associated stroke.
METHODS: A registered meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, 
and Web of Science for relevant literature up to October 31, 2022. The pooled 
relative risk of stroke in HIV-infected people was calculated using a 
random-effects model. HIV prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
datasets were obtained from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, 
and the Global Health Data Exchange, respectively. The population attributable 
fraction was estimated and delivered to calculate the HIV-associated DALYs of 
stroke from 1990 to 2019, at the global, regional, and national levels. Pearson 
correlation analysis were conducted to assess the correlation between the 
age-standardized rate or estimated annual percentage changes and the 
sociodemographic index.
RESULTS: Out of 10 080 identified studies, 11 were included in this 
meta-analysis. Compared with individuals without HIV-infection, the pooled 
relative risk of stroke in HIV-infected individuals was 1.40 (95% CI, 
1.18-1.65). From 1990 to 2019, the global population attributable fraction of 
HIV-associated stroke increased almost 3-fold, while the HIV-associated DALYs 
increased from 18 595 (95% CI, 7485-31 196) in 1990 to 60 684 (95% CI, 
24 281-101 894) in 2019. Meanwhile, HIV-associated DALYs varied by region, with 
Eastern and Southern Africa having the highest value of 126 160 in 2019. 
Moreover, countries with middle social development index were shouldering the 
highest increase trend of the HIV-associated DALYs age-standardized rates.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected individuals face a significantly higher risk of 
stroke, and the global burden of HIV-associated stroke has increased over the 
past 3 decades, showing regional variations. Eastern and Southern Africa bear 
the highest burden, while Eastern Europe and Central Asia have seen significant 
growth. Health care providers, researchers, and decision-makers should give 
increased attention to stroke prevention and management in HIV-endemic areas.

BACKGROUND: eHealth monitoring technologies offer opportunities to more 
objectively assess symptoms when they appear in daily life. Asthma is the most 
common chronic disease in childhood with an episodic course, requiring close 
follow-up of pediatric asthma control to identify disease deterioration, prevent 
exacerbations, and enhance quality of life. eHealth technologies in pediatric 
asthma care show promising results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and 
asthma-related health outcomes. However, broad systematic evaluations of eHealth 
technologies in pediatric asthma are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify the types and 
applications of eHealth technologies for monitoring and treatment in pediatric 
asthma and explore which monitoring domains show the most relevance or potential 
for future research.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines. A systematic and comprehensive search was performed on 
English papers that investigated the development, validation, or application of 
eHealth technologies for home monitoring or treatment of pediatric asthma in the 
following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, IEEE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
and ACM Digital Library. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and 
extracted data. Data were presented by a descriptive analysis of characteristics 
and a narrative report for each eHealth domain.
RESULTS: The review included 370 manuscripts. The following 10 monitoring 
domains were identified: air quality, airway inflammation markers, lung 
function, physical activity, sleep, audiovisual, other physiological 
measurements, questionnaires, medication monitoring, and digital environment 
(ie, digital platforms, applications, websites, and software tools to monitor or 
support monitoring). Rising numbers of studies were seen, and the numbers 
accelerated in the last few years throughout most domains, especially medication 
monitoring and digital environment. Limited studies (35/370, 9.5%) of 
multiparameter monitoring strategies, using three or more domains, were found. 
The number of monitoring validation studies remained stable, while development 
and intervention studies increased. Intervention outcomes seemed to indicate the 
noninferiority and potential superiority of eHealth monitoring in pediatric 
asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic scoping review provides a unique overview of 
eHealth pediatric asthma monitoring studies, and it revealed that eHealth 
research takes place throughout different monitoring domains using different 
approaches. The outcomes of the review showed the potency for efficacy of most 
monitoring domains (especially the domains of medication monitoring, lung 
function, and digital environment). Future studies could focus on modifying 
potentially relevant hospital-based diagnostics for the home setting to 
investigate potential beneficial effects and focus on combining home-monitoring 
domains to facilitate multiparameter decision-making and personalized clinical 
decision support.

PURPOSE: For patients with cancer and their doctors, prognosis is important for 
choosing treatments and supportive care. Oncologists' life expectancy estimates 
are often inaccurate, and many patients are not aware of their general 
prognosis. Machine learning (ML) survival models could be useful in the clinic, 
but there are potential concerns involving accuracy, provider training, and 
patient involvement. We conducted a qualitative study to learn about patient and 
oncologist views on potentially using a ML model for patient care.
METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancer (n = 15) and their family members (n = 
5), radiation oncologists (n = 5), and medical oncologists (n = 5) were 
recruited from a single academic health system. Participants were shown an 
anonymized report from a validated ML survival model for another patient, which 
included a predicted survival curve and a list of variables influencing 
predicted survival. Semistructured interviews were conducted using a script.
RESULTS: Every physician and patient who completed their interview said that 
they would want the option for the model to be used in their practice or care. 
Physicians stated that they would use an AI prognosis model for patient triage 
and increasing patient understanding, but had concerns about accuracy and 
explainability. Patients generally said that they would trust model results 
completely if presented by their physician but wanted to know if the model was 
being used in their care. Some reacted negatively to being shown a median 
survival prediction.
CONCLUSION: Patients and physicians were supportive of use of the model in the 
clinic, but had various concerns, which should be addressed as predictive models 
are increasingly deployed in practice.

Biological therapeutics are major contributors to the pharmaceutical pipeline 
and continue to grow in sales and scope. Additionally, the field's understanding 
of cancer biology has advanced such that biopharmaceuticals can harness the 
power of the immune system for oncology treatments. Several of these novel 
therapeutics are engineered versions of naturally occurring proteins designed to 
improve therapeutic properties including potency, target engagement and 
half-life extension. Cytokines, such as interferons and interleukins, are a 
broad class of signaling proteins which modulate the body's immune response; 
engineered cytokines have entered the clinic as promising new immuno-oncology 
therapies. While these therapies hold great promise, their additional structural 
complexity introduces analytical challenges, and traditional analytical 
platforms may be ill-suited to effectively assess product development risks. 
Further, the pharmaceutical industry relies on streamlining approaches for 
high-throughput experimentation to achieve speed and efficiency for the 
discovery and development of new modalities. These demands necessitate the use 
of state-of-the-art techniques to rapidly characterize these new modalities and 
guide process development and optimization. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption 
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a rapid, sensitive and automatable 
technique amenable for high-throughput analysis of proteins. In this work, we 
have developed an automated MALDI-MS platform to prepare, acquire and analyze 
molecular degradation in engineered PEGylated cytokines formulation samples. 
This orthogonal technique integrated seamlessly with current developability risk 
assessment workflows, ultimately enabling selection of a final formulation 
strategy for clinical development.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is caused by defects in hepatic 
heme biosynthesis, leading to disabling acute neurovisceral attacks and chronic 
symptoms. In ENVISION (NCT03338816), givosiran treatment for 6 months reduced 
attacks and other disease manifestations compared with placebo. Herein, we 
report data from the 36-month final analysis of ENVISION.
METHODS: Ninety-four patients with AHP (age ≥12 years) and recurrent attacks 
were randomized 1:1 to monthly double-blind subcutaneous givosiran 2.5 mg/kg 
(n = 48) or placebo (n = 46) for 6 months. In the open-label extension (OLE) 
period, 93 patients received givosiran 2.5 or 1.25 mg/kg for 6 months or more 
before transitioning to 2.5 mg/kg. Endpoints were exploratory unless otherwise 
noted.
RESULTS: During givosiran treatment, the median annualized attack rate (AAR) was 
0.4. Through Month 36, annualized days of hemin use remained low in the 
continuous givosiran group (median, 0.0 to 0.4) and decreased in the placebo 
crossover group (16.2 to 0.4). At end of OLE, in the continuous givosiran and 
placebo crossover groups, 86% and 92%, respectively, had 0 attacks. AAR was 
lower than historical AAR in 98% and 100%, respectively (post hoc analysis), and 
there were 0 days of hemin use in 88% and 90%, respectively. The 12-item 
short-form health survey physical and mental component summary scores increased 
by 8.6 and 8.1, respectively (continuous givosiran) and 9.4 and 3.2, 
respectively (placebo crossover). EQ-5D health-related questionnaire scores 
increased by 18.9 (continuous givosiran) and 9.9 (placebo crossover). Lower 
urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen levels were sustained. 
Safety findings demonstrated a continued positive risk/benefit profile for 
givosiran.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term monthly givosiran treatment provides sustained and 
continued improvement in clinical manifestations of AHP.
GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03338816.
EUDRACT NUMBER: 2017-002432-17.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of rare, 
chronic, multisystem disorders associated with overproduction and accumulation 
of neurotoxic heme intermediates (delta-aminolevulinic acid and 
porphobilinogen), sometimes resulting in recurrent acute attacks and long-term 
complications. Givosiran, a small-interfering RNA that prevents accumulation of 
delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, is approved for the treatment of 
AHP. These final 36-month results of ENVISION, a phase III study of givosiran in 
patients with AHP and recurrent attacks, show that long-term monthly treatment 
with givosiran leads to continuous and sustained reductions in annualized attack 
rate and use of hemin over time, as well as improved quality of life, with an 
acceptable safety profile. These results are important for physicians, patients, 
families, and caregivers who are grappling with this debilitating and 
potentially life-threatening disease with few effective and tolerable treatment 
options.

Rice is a crucial food crop worldwide, but it is highly susceptible to 
Hirschmanniella mucronata, a migratory parasitic nematode. No rice variety has 
been identified that could resist H. mucronata infection. Therefore, it is very 
important to study the interaction between rice and H. mucronata to breed 
resistant rice varieties. Here, we demonstrated that protein OsWD40-193 
interacted with the extension factor OseEF1A1 and both were negative regulators 
inhibiting rice resistance to H. mucronata infection. Overexpression of either 
OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to enhance susceptibility to H. mucronata, whereas 
the absence of OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to resistance. Further transcriptomic 
analysis showed that OseEF1A1 deletion altered the expression of genes 
association with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and abolic acid signaling 
pathways and increased the accumulation of secondary metabolites to enhance 
resistance in rice. Our study showed that H. mucronata infection affected the 
expression of negative regulators in rice and inhibited rice resistance, which 
was conducive to the infection of nematode. Together, our data showed that H. 
mucronata affected the expression of negative regulators to facilitate its 
infection and provided potential target genes to engineering resistance 
germplasm via gene editing of the negative regulators.

An important step to improve outcomes for patients with schizophrenia is to 
understand treatment patterns in routine practice. The aim of the current study 
was to describe the long-term management of patients with schizophrenia treated 
with antipsychotics (APs) in real-world practice. This population-based study 
included adults with schizophrenia and who had received ≥3 deliveries of an AP 
from 2012-2017, identified using a National Health Data System. Primary 
endpoints were real-life prescription patterns, patient characteristics, 
healthcare utilization, comorbidities and mortality. Of the 456,003 patients 
included, 96% received oral APs, 17.5% first-generation long-acting injectable 
APs (LAIs), and 16.1% second generation LAIs. Persistence rates at 24 months 
after treatment initiation were 23.9% (oral APs), 11.5% (first-generation LAIs) 
and 20.8% (second-generation LAIs). Median persistence of oral APs, 
first-generation LAIs and second-generation LAIs was 5.0, 3.3, and 6.1 months, 
respectively. Overall, 62.1% of patients were administered anxiolytics, 45.7% 
antidepressants and 28.5% anticonvulsants, these treatments being more 
frequently prescribed in women and patients aged ≥50 years. Dyslipidemia was the 
most frequent metabolic comorbidity (16.2%) but lipid monitoring was 
insufficient (median of one occasion). Metabolic comorbidities were more 
frequent in women. Standardized patient mortality remained consistently high 
between 2013 and 2015 (3.3-3.7 times higher than the general French population) 
with a loss of life expectancy of 17 years for men and 8 years for women. Cancer 
(20.2%) and cardiovascular diseases (17.2%) were the main causes of mortality, 
and suicide was responsible for 25.4% of deaths among 18-34-year-olds. These 
results highlight future priorities for care of schizophrenia patients. The 
global persistence of APs used in this population was low, whereas rates of 
psychiatric hospitalization remain high. More focus on specific populations is 
needed, such as patients aged >50 years to prevent metabolic disturbances and 
18-34-year-olds to reduce suicide rates.

Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) is an economically important coniferous tree 
in Japan. However, abundant sugi pollen grains are dispersed and transported by 
the wind each spring and cause a severe pollen allergy syndrome (Japanese cedar 
pollinosis). The use of pollen-free sugi that cannot produce pollen has been 
thought as a countermeasure to Japanese cedar pollinosis. The sugi CjACOS5 gene 
is an ortholog of Arabidopsis ACOS5 and rice OsACOS12, which encode an acyl-CoA 
synthetase that is involved in the synthesis of sporopollenin in pollen walls. 
To generate pollen-free sugi, we mutated CjACOS5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
As a result of sugi transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens 
harboring the CjACOS5-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 vector, 1 bp-deleted homo biallelic 
mutant lines were obtained. Chimeric mutant lines harboring both mutant and 
wild-type CjACOS5 genes were also generated. The homo biallelic mutant lines had 
no-pollen in male strobili, whereas chimeric mutant lines had male strobili with 
or without pollen grains. Our results suggest that CjACOS5 is essential for the 
production of pollen in sugi and that its disruption is useful for the 
generation of pollen-free sugi. In addition to conventional transgenic 
technology, genome editing technology, including CRISPR/Cas9, can confer new 
traits on sugi.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, primary surgical treatment of older women with 
non-metastatic breast cancer has decreased in favor of primary endocrine therapy 
(PET). PET can be considered in women with a remaining life expectancy of less 
than five years. The aim of this study was to (1) assess the risk of distant 
metastases and other cause mortality over ten years in women aged 65 and older 
with stage I-III breast cancer treated with PET, (2) whether this was associated 
with geriatric characteristics and comorbidities and to (3) describe the reasons 
on which the choice for PET was made.
METHODS: Women were included from the retrospective FOCUS cohort, which 
comprises all incident women diagnosed with breast cancer aged 65 or older 
between January 1997 and December 2004 in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Region 
West in the Netherlands. We selected women (N = 257) with stage I-III breast 
cancer and treated with PET from this cohort. Patient characteristics (including 
comorbidity, polypharmacy, walking, cognitive and sensory impairment), treatment 
and tumor characteristics were retrospectively extracted from charts. Outcomes 
were distant metastasis and other cause mortality. Cumulative incidences were 
calculated using the Cumulative Incidence for Competing Risks method (CICR); and 
subdistribution hazard ratios (SHR) were tested between groups based on age, 
geriatric characteristics and comorbidity with the Fine and Gray model.
RESULTS: Women treated with PET were on average 84 years old and 41% had one or 
more geriatric characteristics. Other cause mortality exceeded the cumulative 
incidence of distant metastasis over ten years (83 versus 5.6%). The risk of 
dying from another cause further increased in women with geriatric 
characteristics (SHR 2.06, p < 0.001) or two or more comorbidities (SHR 1.72, 
p < 0.001). Often the reason for omitting surgery was not recorded (52.9%), but 
if recorded surgery was omitted mainly at the patient's request (18.7%).
DISCUSSION: This study shows that the cumulative incidence of distant metastasis 
is much lower than other cause mortality in older women with breast cancer 
treated with PET, especially in the presence of geriatric characteristics or 
comorbidities. This confirms the importance of assessment of geriatric 
characteristics to aid counseling of older women.

INTRODUCTION: Countries develop their EQ-5D-5L value sets using the EuroQol 
Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) protocol. This study aims to assess if extension in 
the conventional EQ-VT design can lead to development of value sets with 
improved precision.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in a representative sample of
