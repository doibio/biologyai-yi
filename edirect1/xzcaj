BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributed 
disease burden by DALYs (disability adjusted life years) in the BRICS countries 
(Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) between 1990 and 2013, and 
explore to what extent these countries have implemented evidence-based alcohol 
policies during the same time period.
METHODS: A comparative risk assessment approach and literature review, within a 
setting of the BRICS countries. Participants were the total populations (males 
and females combined) of each country. Levels of alcohol consumption, 
age-standardized alcohol-attributable DALYs per 100 000 and alcohol policy 
documents were measured.
RESULTS: The alcohol-attributed disease burden mirrors level of consumption in 
Brazil, Russia and India, to some extent in China, but not in South Africa. 
Between the years 1990-2013 DALYs per 100 000 decreased in Brazil (from 2124 to 
1902), China (from 1719 to 1250) and South Africa (from 2926 to 2662). An 
increase was observed in Russia (from 4015 to 4719) and India (from 1574 to 
1722). Policies were implemented in all of the BRICS countries and the most 
common were tax increases, drink-driving measures and restrictions on 
advertisement.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an overall decrease in alcohol-related DALYs in Brazil, 
China and South Africa, while an overall increase was observed in Russia and 
India. Most notably is the change in DALYs in Russia, where a distinct increase 
from 1990-2005 was followed by a steady decrease from 2005-2013. Even if 
assessment of causality cannot be done, policy changes were generally followed 
by changes in alcohol-attributed disease burden. This highlights the importance 
of more detailed research on this topic.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of childhood pneumonia is a key priority in low-income 
countries, with substantial resource implications. WHO revised their guidelines 
for the management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. We estimated and compared the 
resource requirements, total direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness of 
childhood pneumonia management in 74 countries with high burden of child 
mortality (Countdown countries) using the 2005 and 2013 revised WHO guidelines.
METHODS: We constructed a cost model using a bottom up approach to estimate the 
cost of childhood pneumonia management using the 2005 and 2013 WHO guidelines 
from a public provider perspective in 74 Countdown countries. The cost of 
pneumonia treatment was estimated, by country, for year 2013, including costs of 
medicines and service delivery at three different management levels. We also 
assessed country-specific lives saved and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
averted due to pneumonia treated in children aged below five years. The 
cost-effectiveness of pneumonia treatment was estimated in terms of cost per 
DALY averted by fully implementing WHO treatment guidelines relative to no 
treatment intervention for pneumonia.
RESULTS: Achieving full treatment coverage with the 2005 WHO guidelines was 
estimated to cost US$ 2.9 (1.9-4.2) billion compared to an estimated US$ 1.8 
(0.8-3.0) billion for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines in these countries. 
Pneumonia management in young children following WHO treatment guidelines could 
save up to 39.8 million DALYs compared to a zero coverage scenario in the year 
2013 in the 74 Countdown countries. The median cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY 
averted in 74 countries was substantially lower for the 2013 guidelines: US$ 
26.6 (interquartile range IQR: 17.7-45.9) vs US$ 38.3 (IQR: US$ 26.2-86.9) per 
DALY averted for the 2005 guideline respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Child pneumonia management as detailed in standard WHO guidelines 
is a very cost-effective intervention. Implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines 
is expected to result in a 39.5% reduction in treatment costs compared to the 
2005 guidelines which could save up to US$ 1.16 (0.68-1.23) billion in the 74 
Countdown countries, with potential savings greatest in low HIV burden countries 
which can implement effective community case management of pneumonia.

Plasmon rulers (PRs) exploit the potential of plasmon coupling between 
individual pairs of noble metal nanoparticles in biological processes, 
especially single-molecule detection. Herein, for the first time, we report a 
strategy based on Ag PRs for in situ monitoring of the extension process of 
telomerase primer (TSP) activated by a single telomerase.

This chapter begins with a brief review of descriptions and definitions of 
mystical-type experiences and the historical connection between classic 
hallucinogens and mystical experiences. The chapter then explores the empirical 
literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about 
mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated 
questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type 
experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies 
show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for 
expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the 
majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to 
psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have 
enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as 
assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. 
Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and 
therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance 
abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a 
life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical 
experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw 
parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences 
with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for 
which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these 
parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based 
on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed 
after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation 
practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.

Health system functionality in a low-income country in the midst of conflict: 
the case of Yemen.

BACKGROUND:  Although the literature on effects of armed conflict on population 
health is extensive, detailed assessments of effects on public health 'systems' 
are few. This article aims to help address this deficit through the medium of a 
case study on Yemen, describing health system and health outcome performance 
prior to the internationalisation of the conflict there in March 2015, before 
assessing the impact of war on health system functionality since that time.
METHOD: Review of peer- and non-peer reviewed literature from 2005 to 2016 from 
academic sources, multilateral organizations, donors and governmental and 
non-governmental organizations, augmented by secondary data analysis.
RESULTS: Despite significant health system weaknesses and structural 
vulnerabilities pre-conflict, there were important improvements in selected 
health outcome measures in Yemen up to early 2015 (life expectancy, and infant 
and maternal mortality, e.g.), partly driven by a fragile health sector that was 
heavily reliant on out-of-pocket expenditure, and hampered by weak service 
penetration especially in rural areas. High intensity conflict has resulted in 
rising mortality and injury rates since March 2015, the first decline in life 
expectancy and increase in child and maternal mortality in Yemen for some years, 
and worsening levels of malnutrition. Service delivery has become increasingly 
challenging in the context of a funding crisis, destruction of health 
facilities, widespread shortages of essential medicines and equipment across the 
country, and governance fragmentation.
CONCLUSION: Conflict in Yemen has resulted in humanitarian disaster on a wide 
scale in a short period of time, and crippled an already weak health system. 
Important areas of uncertainty remain, however, including the scale of health 
worker flight, and the extent to which alternative providers have stepped in to 
fill widening service gaps as the conflict has unfolded. Planning for 
longer-term health system reconstruction should begin as soon as possible.

Armillaria possesses several intriguing characteristics that have inspired wide 
interest in understanding phylogenetic relationships within and among species of 
this genus. Nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence-based analyses of Armillaria provide 
only limited information for phylogenetic studies among widely divergent taxa. 
More recent studies have shown that translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) 
sequences are highly informative for phylogenetic analysis of Armillaria species 
within diverse global regions. This study used Neighbor-net and 
coalescence-based Bayesian analyses to examine phylogenetic relationships of 
newly determined and existing tef1 sequences derived from diverse Armillaria 
species from across the Northern Hemisphere, with Southern Hemisphere Armillaria 
species included for reference. Based on the Bayesian analysis of tef1 
sequences, Armillaria species from the Northern Hemisphere are generally 
contained within the following four superclades, which are named according to 
the specific epithet of the most frequently cited species within the superclade: 
(i) Socialis/Tabescens (exannulate) superclade including Eurasian A. ectypa, 
North American A. socialis (A. tabescens), and Eurasian A. socialis (A. 
tabescens) clades; (ii) Mellea superclade including undescribed annulate North 
American Armillaria sp. (Mexico) and four separate clades of A. mellea (Europe 
and Iran, eastern Asia, and two groups from North America); (iii) Gallica 
superclade including Armillaria Nag E (Japan), multiple clades of A. gallica 
(Asia and Europe), A. calvescens (eastern North America), A. cepistipes (North 
America), A. altimontana (western USA), A. nabsnona (North America and Japan), 
and at least two A. gallica clades (North America); and (iv) Solidipes/Ostoyae 
superclade including two A. solidipes/ostoyae clades (North America), A. gemina 
(eastern USA), A. solidipes/ostoyae (Eurasia), A. cepistipes (Europe and Japan), 
A. sinapina (North America and Japan), and A. borealis (Eurasia) clade 2. Of 
note is that A. borealis (Eurasia) clade 1 appears basal to the 
Solidipes/Ostoyae and Gallica superclades. The Neighbor-net analysis showed 
similar phylogenetic relationships. This study further demonstrates the utility 
of tef1 for global phylogenetic studies of Armillaria species and provides 
critical insights into multiple taxonomic issues that warrant further study.

Widening economic inequality in the USA has been accompanied by increasing 
disparities in health outcomes. The life expectancy of the wealthiest Americans 
now exceeds that of the poorest by 10-15 years. This report, part of a Series on 
health and inequality in the USA, focuses on how the health-care system, which 
could reduce income-based disparities in health, instead often exacerbates them. 
Other articles in this Series address population health inequalities, and the 
health effects of racism, mass incarceration, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 
Poor Americans have worse access to care than do wealthy Americans, partly 
because many remain uninsured despite coverage expansions since 2010 due to the 
ACA. For individuals with private insurance, rising premiums and cost sharing 
have undermined wage gains and driven many households into debt and even 
bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the share of health-care resources devoted to care of the 
wealthy has risen. Additional reforms that move forward, rather than backward, 
from the ACA are sorely needed to mitigate health and health-care inequalities 
and reduce the financial burdens of medical care borne by non-wealthy Americans.

In this Series paper, we examine how mass incarceration shapes inequality in 
health. The USA is the world leader in incarceration, which disproportionately 
affects black populations. Nearly one in three black men will ever be 
imprisoned, and nearly half of black women currently have a family member or 
extended family member who is in prison. However, until recently the public 
health implications of mass incarceration were unclear. Most research in this 
area has focused on the health of current and former inmates, with findings 
suggesting that incarceration could produce some short-term improvements in 
physical health during imprisonment but has profoundly harmful effects on 
physical and mental health after release. The emerging literature on the family 
and community effects of mass incarceration points to negative health impacts on 
the female partners and children of incarcerated men, and raises concerns that 
excessive incarceration could harm entire communities and thus might partly 
underlie health disparities both in the USA and between the USA and other 
developed countries. Research into interventions, policies, and practices that 
could mitigate the harms of incarceration and the post-incarceration period is 
urgently needed, particularly studies using rigorous experimental or 
quasi-experimental designs.

Income inequality in the USA has increased over the past four decades. 
Socioeconomic gaps in survival have also increased. Life expectancy has risen 
among middle-income and high-income Americans whereas it has stagnated among 
poor Americans and even declined in some demographic groups. Although the 
increase in income inequality since 1980 has been driven largely by soaring top 
incomes, the widening of survival inequalities has occurred lower in the 
distribution-ie, between the poor and upper-middle class. Growing survival gaps 
across income percentiles since 2001 reflect falling real incomes among poor 
Americans as well as an increasingly strong association between low income and 
poor health. Changes in individual risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and 
substance abuse play a part but do not fully explain the steeper gradient. 
Distal factors correlated with rising inequality including unequal access to 
technological innovations, increased geographical segregation by income, reduced 
economic mobility, mass incarceration, and increased exposure to the costs of 
medical care might have reduced access to salutary determinants of health among 
low-income Americans. Having missed out on decades of income growth and 
longevity gains, low-income Americans are increasingly left behind. Without 
interventions to decouple income and health, or to reduce inequalities in 
income, we might see the emergence of a 21st century health-poverty trap and the 
further widening and hardening of socioeconomic inequalities in health.

Craniopharyngiomas are benign but aggressive epithelial tumors usually 
originating in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland from squamous remnants 
of an incompletely involuted craniopharingeal duct developing from the Rathke 
pouch. To the authors' knowledge only 1 patient of a primary isolated ethmoidal 
craniopharyngioma has been reported in the literature.The authors report the 
case of a 17-year-old boy with a primary extracranial ethmoidal 
craniopharyngioma. An endoscopic endonasal approach was employed to resect the 
tumor. After 2 years of clinical and radiological follow-up no recurrence of 
disease was observed.Primary ethmoidal craniopharyngiomas are rare entities and 
biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. However, a preoperative assessment by means 
of nasal endoscopy, computed tomography scan, and enhanced magnetic resonance 
imaging is mandatory to better evaluate the extension and characteristics of the 
tumor. The endoscopic endonasal technique is a safe and effective approach for 
the treatment of these lesions.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of home nursing interventions according to 
the satisfaction of the elderly users.
METHODS: Ex-post facto evaluative, qualitative and descriptive research, 
conducted from November 2015 to January 2016 with 12 dependent elderly 
individuals accompanied by an extension project in the city of Maringá, PR, 
Brazil. Data were collected after home interventions based on the Single-User 
Treatment Project, by means of semi-structured interviews subjected to content 
analysis and the theoretical framework of Donabedian.
RESULTS: The following thematic categories emerged: "home nursing intervention: 
synonymous with joy, distraction and bonding" and" home nursing intervention:

BACKGROUND: Cluster B personality disorders (PDs) are prevalent mental health 
conditions in the general population (1%-6% depending on the subtype and study). 
Affected patients are known to be heavier users of both mental and medical 
health care systems than patients with other clinical conditions such as 
depression.
METHODS: Several rates were estimated using data from the integrated monitoring 
system for chronic diseases in the province of Quebec, Canada. It provides a 
profile of annual and period prevalence rates, mortality rates, and years of 
lost life as well as health care utilisation rates for Quebec residents. All 
Quebec residents are covered by a universal publicly managed care health plan. 
It is estimated that the monitoring system includes 99% of Quebec's 8 million 
inhabitants.
RESULTS: Quebec residents aged 14 years and older were included in the study. 
The lifetime prevalence of cluster B PDs was 2.6%. The mean years of lost life 
expectancy were 13 for men and 9 for women compared to the provincial 
population. The 3 most important causes of death are suicide (20.4%), 
cardiovascular diseases (19.1%), and cancers (18.6%). In 2011 to 2012, 78% had 
consulted a general practitioner and 62% a psychiatrist, 44% were admitted to an 
emergency department, and 22% were hospitalised.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering mortality, cluster B personality disorder is a severe 
condition, is highly prevalent in the population, and is associated with heavy 
health care services utilisation, especially in emergency settings.

CONTEXTE: Les troubles de la personnalité (TP) du groupe B sont des conditions 
prévalentes dans la population générales (1 à 6% selon le sous-type et les 
études). Les patients qui en souffrent sont reconnus pour être de plus important 
utilisateurs des systèmes de santé mentale et médicale que les patients 
souffrant d’autres affections cliniques comme la dépression.
MÉTHODES: Le Système Intégré de Surveillance des Maladies Chroniques du Québec 
permet d’estimer plusieurs données concernant les TP du groupe B dans la 
province de Québec. Il donne ainsi leur prévalence annuelle et cumulée, leur 
taux de mortalité, leur nombre moyen d’années de vie perdu et aussi leurs taux 
d’utilisation de service. Tous les résidents de la province sont couverts par un 
système de santé universel et public. On estime que le système de surveillance 
inclut 99% des 8 millions d’habitants du Québec.
RÉSULTATS: Les résidents du Québec de 14 ans et plus ont été inclus dans 
l’étude. La prévalence cumulée des TP du groupe B est de 2,6%. Le nombre moyen 
d’années de vie perdues est de 13 pour les hommes et de 9 pour les femmes, 
comparativement à la population générale. Les 3 principales causes de décès sont 
le suicide (20,4%), les maladies cardiovasculaires (19,1%) et les cancers 
(18,6%). En 2011-2012, 78% ont consulté un omnipraticien, 62% un psychiatre, 44% 
ont été admis dans un service d’urgence, et 22% ont été hospitalisés.
CONCLUSIONS: Compte tenu de la mortalité, les TP du groupe B sont graves. Ils 
sont hautement prévalent dans la population, et ils sont associés à une 
importante utilisation des services de santé, en particulier dans les services 
d’urgence.

In the last decades, the extension of life expectancy and the increased 
consumption of foods rich in saturated fats and added sugars have exposed the 
general population to emerging health problems. The prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome (MS), composed of a cluster of factors as obesity, dyslipidemia, 
hyperglycemia, and hypertension, is rapidly increasing in industrialized and 
developing countries leading to precocious onset of age-related diseases. 
Indeed, oxidative stress, accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts, and a 
chronic low-grade inflammation are common features of MS and physiological 
ageing. In particular, the entire set of MS factors contributes to the 
development of an inflammatory status named metaflammation, which has been 
associated with activation of early innate immune response through the 
assembling of the multiprotein complex inflammasome. The most investigated 
family of inflammasome platforms is the NOD-like receptor pyridine containing 
(NLRP) 3, which is activated by several exogenous and endogenous stimuli, 
leading to the sequential cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, followed by secretion 
of active IL-1β. We here collect the most recent findings on NLRP3 activation in 
MS providing evidence of its central role in disease progression and organ 
dysfunction in target tissues of metaflammation, in particular in 
cardiovascular, hepatic and renal complications, with a focus on oxidative 
stress and advanced glycation endproducts. A wide overview of the most promising 
strategies for the modulation of NLRP3 activation and related metabolic 
repercussions is also provided, since the finding of specific pharmacological 
tools is an urgent requirement to reduce the social and economic burden of MS- 
and elderly-associated diseases.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by systemic 
metabolic abnormalities and the development of micro- and macrovascular 
complications, resulting in a shortened life expectancy. A recent cardiovascular 
(CV) safety trial, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, showed that empagliflozin, a 
sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, markedly reduced CV death and 
all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2DM 
and established CV disease (CVD). SGLT2 inhibitors are known to not only 
decrease plasma glucose levels, but also favorably modulate a wide range of 
metabolic and hemodynamic disorders related to CV pathways. Although some 
experimental studies revealed a beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
atherosclerosis, there is a paucity of clinical data showing that they can slow 
the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. Therefore, the EMBLEM 
trial was designed to investigate whether empagliflozin treatment can improve 
endothelial function, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis, in patients with T2DM and established CVD.
METHODS: The EMBLEM trial is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, 
placebo-controlled double-blind randomized, investigator-initiated clinical 
trial in Japan. A total of 110 participants with T2DM (HbA1c range 6.0-10.0%) 
and with established CVD will be randomized (1:1) to receive either 
empagliflozin 10 mg once daily or a placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial 
is change in the reactive hyperemia (RH)-peripheral arterial tonometry-derived 
RH index at 24 weeks from baseline. For comparison of treatment effects between 
the treatment groups, the baseline-adjusted means and their 95% confidence 
intervals will be estimated by analysis of covariance adjusted for the following 
allocation factors: HbA1c (<7.0 or ≥7.0%), age (<65 or ≥65 years), systolic 
blood pressure (<140 or ≥140 mmHg), and current smoking status (nonsmoker or 
smoker). Key secondary endpoints include the change from baseline for other 
vascular-related markers such as arterial stiffness, sympathetic nervous 
activity, and parameters of cardiac and renal function. Importantly, serious 
adverse effects independently on the causal relationship to the trial drugs and 
protocol will be also evaluated throughout the trial period.
DISCUSSION: EMBLEM is the first trial to assess the effect of empagliflozin on 
endothelial function in patients with T2DM and established CVD. Additionally, 
mechanisms associating empagliflozin-mediated actions with endothelial function 
and other CV markers will be evaluated. Thus, the trial is designed to elucidate 
potential mechanisms by which empagliflozin protects CV systems and improves CV 
outcomes. Trial registration Unique Trial Number, UMIN000024502 (

OBJECTIVE: People with psychotic disorders have an increased metabolic risk and 
a shortened life expectancy compared to the general population. Two large 
studies showed that metabolic disorders were untreated in a majority of the 
patients. Since then, guidelines have urged monitoring of metabolic health. This 
study examined the course of metabolic disorders over time in people with 
psychotic disorders and investigated current treatment rates.
METHODS: A total of 1,259 patients with psychotic disorders, as defined by the 
DSM-IV, from 4 Dutch mental health institutions participated in 3 yearly 
assessments of the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring and Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS) 
between 2006 and 2014. Patients' metabolic parameters were measured, and the use 
of pharmacologic treatment for hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg 
and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg), dyslipidemia (5% ≤ Systematic 
COronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE] risk < 10% and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] 
cholesterol level ≥ 2.5 mmol/L or SCORE risk ≥ 10% and LDL cholesterol level ≥ 
1.8 mmol/L and/or triglycerides ≥ 2.3 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia (hemoglobin A1c 
concentration > 7% and/or fasting glucose concentration ≥ 7.2 mmol/L) was 
recorded.
RESULTS: Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the National 
Cholesterol Education Program criteria, was > 50% at each assessment. On the 
basis of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, pharmacotherapy for 
metabolic disorders was recommended for 52%-59% of the patients at each 
assessment. Treatment rates with antihypertensive (from 31% to 38%, P < .001) 
pharmacotherapy increased throughout the assessments. However, half of the 
patients were not treated for their metabolic risk factors while being monitored 
for 3 years or longer. Older patients were more likely to receive treatment, and 
patients who received treatment had lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol 
and triglyceride concentrations than patients not receiving the recommended 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic risk factors are still seriously undertreated in people 
with psychotic disorders. Better adherence to and better implementation of 
guidelines about monitoring and treating metabolic disorders in psychiatry are 
crucial.

BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder 
with increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of a 
strategy of initiating BP treatment with oral doxycycline or oral prednisolone. 
We hypothesised that starting treatment with doxycycline gives acceptable 
short-term blister control while conferring long-term safety advantages over 
starting treatment with oral prednisolone.
DESIGN: Pragmatic multicentre two-armed parallel-group randomised controlled 
trial with an economic evaluation.
SETTING: A total of 54 dermatology secondary care centres in the UK and seven in 
Germany.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with BP [three or more blisters at two sites and positive 
direct and/or indirect immunofluorescence (immunoglobulin G and/or complement 
component 3 immunofluorescence at the dermal-epidermal junction)] and able to 
give informed consent.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated using online randomisation to initial 
doxycycline treatment (200 mg/day) or prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day). Up to 
30 g/week of potent topical corticosteroids was permitted for weeks 1-3. After 6 
weeks, clinicians could switch treatments or alter the prednisolone dose as per 
normal practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes: (1) the proportion of participants with 
three or fewer blisters at 6 weeks (investigator blinded) and (2) the proportion 
with severe, life-threatening and fatal treatment-related events at 52 weeks. A 
regression model was used in the analysis adjusting for baseline disease 
severity, age and Karnofsky score, with missing data imputed. Secondary outcomes 
included the effectiveness of blister control after 6 weeks, relapses, related 
adverse events and quality of life. The economic evaluation involved bivariate 
regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a NHS 
perspective.
RESULTS: In total, 132 patients were randomised to doxycycline and 121 to 
prednisolone. The mean patient age was 77.7 years and baseline severity was as 
follows: mild 31.6% (three to nine blisters), moderate 39.1% (10-30 blisters) 
and severe 29.3% (> 30 blisters). For those starting on doxycycline, 83 out of 
112 (74.1%) had three or fewer blisters at 6 weeks, whereas for those starting 
on prednisolone 92 out of 101 (91.1%) had three or fewer blisters at 6 weeks, an 
adjusted difference of 18.6% in favour of prednisolone [90% confidence interval 
(CI) 11.1% to 26.1%], using a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis. 
Per-protocol analysis showed similar results: 74.4% compared with 92.3%, an 
adjusted difference of 18.7% (90% CI 9.8% to 27.6%). The rate of related severe, 
life-threatening and fatal events at 52 weeks was 18.2% for those started on 
doxycycline and 36.6% for those started on prednisolone (mITT analysis), an 
adjusted difference of 19.0% (95% CI 7.9% to 30.1%; p = 0.001) in favour of 
doxycycline. Secondary outcomes showed consistent findings. There was no 
significant difference in costs or QALYs per patient at 1 year between 
doxycycline-initiated therapy and prednisolone-initiated therapy (incremental 
cost of doxycycline-initiated therapy £959, 95% CI -£24 to £1941; incremental 
QALYs of doxycycline-initiated therapy -0.024, 95% CI -0.088 to 0.041). Using a 
willingness-to-pay criterion of < £20,000 per QALY gained, the net monetary 
benefit associated with doxycycline-initiated therapy was negative but imprecise 
(-£1432, 95% CI -£3094 to £230).
CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of starting BP patients on doxycycline is non-inferior 
to standard treatment with oral prednisolone for short-term blister control and 
considerably safer in the long term. The limitations of the trial were the wide 
non-inferiority margin, the moderate dropout rate and that serious adverse event 
collection was unblinded. Future work might include inducing remission with 
topical or oral corticosteroids and then randomising to doxycycline or 
prednisolone for maintenance.

The consistent growth in human life expectancy during the recent years has 
driven governments and private organizations to increase the efforts in caring 
for the eldest segment of the population. These institutions have built 
hospitals and retirement homes that have been rapidly overfilled, making their 
associated maintenance and operating costs prohibitive. The latest advances in 
technology and communications envisage new ways to monitor those people with 
special needs at their own home, increasing their quality of life in a 
cost-affordable way. The purpose of this paper is to present an Ambient Assisted 
Living (AAL) platform able to analyze, identify, and detect specific acoustic 
events happening in daily life environments, which enables the medic staff to 
remotely track the status of every patient in real-time. Additionally, this 
tele-care proposal is validated through a proof-of-concept experiment that takes 
benefit of the capabilities of the NVIDIA Graphical Processing Unit running on a 
Jetson TK1 board to locally detect acoustic events. Conducted experiments 
demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by reaching an overall accuracy of 
82% when identifying a set of 14 indoor environment events related to the 
domestic surveillance and patients' behaviour monitoring field. Obtained results 
encourage practitioners to keep working in this direction, and enable health 
care providers to remotely track the status of their patients in real-time with 
non-invasive methods.

Road injuries, health burden, but not fatalities make 12- to 17-year olds a high 
risk group in the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: To explore the impact of road injuries for different age groups, 
this study compares the health burden of road injuries in young adolescents-12 
to 17 years of age-to those for older age groups. Young adolescents are 
underrepresented in road fatalities. However, their inexperience, developmental 
stage and use of bicycles may expose them to high levels of road risk, but their 
physical resilience may help them survive injuries which in older age groups 
would be fatal.
METHODS: To assess the impact of injuries compared with death, this study 
assessed by age group the health burden expressed in disability adjusted life 
years; years of life lost plus years lived with disability. Its analyses make 
use of existing data bases on road fatalities, serious injuries (maximum 
abbreviated injury score 2 or more), travel, life expectancy and disability 
weights.
RESULTS: For young adolescents, seriously injuries per distance travelled 
(injury risk) were higher than for any other age group, except for the elderly 
(75+). This was further amplified when health burden was taken into account, 
showing these young adolescents to be responsible for 15% of the total health 
burden associated with road crashes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results justify extra efforts to improve the understanding 
and prevention of injury-only crashes among young adolescents.
