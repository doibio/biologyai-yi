In vitro tests on the biomechanical properties of human spines are often 
performed using fresh frozen specimens. However, this carries the risk of 
pathogen transfer from specimen to the worker and the specimens can only be used 
for a limited amount of time. Human spinal specimens embalmed with formaldehyde 
carry an almost absent risk of transfer of pathogens and can be stored and used 
for a long time, but the tissue properties are strongly affected making this 
method inapplicable for biomechanical testing. In this study, a new embalming 
technique called Fix for Life (F4L), which claims to preserve the tissue 
properties, was tested. The range of motion (ROM) and stiffness of six fresh 
human spinal specimens was measured using a spinal motion simulator before and 
after F4L embalming. After F4L embalming, spinal stiffness increased in 
flexion-extension by 230%, in lateral bending by 284% and in axial rotation by 
271%. ROM decreased by 46% in flexion-extension, 56% in lateral bending and 54% 
in axial rotation. In conclusion, based on this study, F4L does not maintain 
physiological spinal biomechanical properties, and we propose that this method 
should not be used for biomechanical studies. Nevertheless, the method may be an 
alternative to formaldehyde fixation in situations such as training and 
education because the effect on spinal biomechanics is less detrimental than 
formaldehyde and tissue color is maintained.

BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown a 
significant but only marginally improved median overall survival when combined 
with gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer. Vandetanib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR2, RET, and 
EGFR, all of which are in involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. We 
investigated the clinical efficacy of vandetanib when used in combination with 
gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: The Vandetanib in Pancreatic Cancer (ViP) trial was a phase 2 
double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial in previously 
untreated adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with locally advanced or 
metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas confirmed by cytology or histology. 
Patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2 
and a documented life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients were randomly 
assigned 1:1 to receive vandetanib plus gemcitabine (vandetanib group) or 
placebo plus gemcitabine (placebo group) according to pre-generated sequences 
produced on the principle of randomly permuted blocks with variable block sizes 
of two and four. Patients were stratified at randomisation by disease stage and 
ECOG performance status. All patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a 
30-min intravenous infusion, weekly, for 7 weeks followed by a 1-week break, 
followed by a cycle of 3 weeks of treatment with a 1-week break, until disease 
progression, and either oral vandetanib 300 mg per day once daily or matching 
placebo. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The 
primary outcome measure was overall survival (defined as the difference in time 
between randomisation and death from any cause or the censor date) in the 
intention-to-treat population. This trial has been completed and the final 
results are reported. The study is registered at EudraCT, number 2007-004299-38, 
and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN96397434.
FINDINGS: Patients were screened and enrolled between Oct 24, 2011, and Oct 7, 
2013. Of 381 patients screened, 142 eligible patients were randomly assigned to 
treatment (72 to the vandetanib group and 70 to the placebo group). At database 
lock on July 15, 2015, at a median follow-up of 24·9 months (IQR 24·3 to not 
attainable), 131 patients had died: 70 (97%) of 72 in the vandetanib group and 
61 (87%) of 70 in the placebo group. The median overall survival was 8·83 months 
(95% CI 7·11-11·58) in the vandetanib group and 8·95 months (6·55-11·74) in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio 1·21, 80·8% CI 0·95-1·53; log rank χ21df 1·1, 
p=0·303). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (35 [49%] of 
72 patients in the vandetanib group vs 22 [31%] of 70 in the placebo group), 
thrombocytopenia (20 [28%] vs 16 [23%]), hypertension (nine [13%] vs 11 [16%]), 
leucopenia (12 [17%] vs 13 [19%]), and fatigue (17 [24%] vs 15 [21%]). No 
treatment-related deaths occurred during the study.
INTERPRETATION: The addition of vandetanib to gemcitabine monotherapy did not 
improve overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer. Tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors might still have potential in the treatment of pancreatic cancer but 
further development requires the identification of biomarkers to specifically 
identify responsive cancer subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Proximal fixation loss following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR) creates a clinical dilemma. Typically, endovascular salvage requires 
adequate aortic neck below the renal arteries, in cases with no infrarenal neck 
proximal extension into the paravisceral aorta using parallel grafts provides an 
alternative to open graft explant. We present our experience at a tertiary care 
center with endovascular management of proximal fixation loss following EVAR 
using parallel stent grafting techniques to preserve renal and visceral 
branches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of our type I 
endoleak database. Of 135 patients, 19 patients were identified that required 
Ch-EVAR as a salvage procedure for loss of proximal fixation or seal after a 
previous EVAR. Data from all procedures, as well as the entire hospital course, 
and documented follow-up were captured and analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the cohort was 83 (78-88) years. The average time 
from original EVAR to secondary treatment was 6.05 years. The most common 
primary endograft treated was the AneuRx stent graft at 37% (n = 7). Ninety-five 
percent of patients were treated for an expanding aneurysm sac with 21% of 
patients being symptomatic at the time of treatment. Open femoral access was 
used more commonly than a percutaneous approach (n = 14 vs. 5). Adjunctive 
proximal arterial access was required in 58% of cases; open axillary exposure 
(n = 4), percutaneous brachial (n = 4), and open brachial (n = 3) access. 
Eighteen patients received proximal cuffs in addition to parallel stent grafts, 
whereas 1 patient required an entire endograft relining in addition to the 
parallel visceral stents. Twenty-nine total parallel stent grafts were placed, 
most commonly in a single renal artery (n = 27). Primary technical success was 
achieved in 100% of cases with exclusion of all type IA endoleaks. 
Reintervention was required for 1 patient for a new type III endoleak. There was 
an average follow-up time of 520.5 days with 100% snorkel patency.
CONCLUSIONS: Although technically challenging, endovascular salvage of proximal 
fixation failure after EVAR is possible with extension to the paravisceral aorta 
using parallel graft techniques. Parallel chimney stent treatment for proximal 
fixation failure following EVAR can be performed with high technical success, 
low need for reintervention, and excellent midterm patency rates. Given these 
findings, chimney stent treatment should be considered the primary mode of 
therapy for those patients with limited life span and extensive medical 
comorbidities.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke. Previous 
studies have reported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) may exert 
beneficial effects on the treatment of ICH. However, it remains unknown whether 
the neuroprotection exerted by BMSCs on ICH is due to the differentiation of 
BMSCs, or the trophic factors secreted into their conditioned medium (CM). In 
addition, growth‑associated protein‑43 (GAP‑43) is a protein associated with 
neurite extension, which may be considered a prospective therapeutic target in 
the treatment of ICH. The present study investigated whether administration of 
BMSC‑CM could be considered as an alternative to the established treatment of 
direct BMSC transplantation; in addition, the underlying mechanisms were 
evaluated. Neurological function tests, brain water content, reverse 
transcription ‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were 
used in present study. The current study indicated that the neuroprotective 
effects of BMSC implantation and BMSC-CM treatment are similar, and that both 
decrease the severity of post‑ICH cerebral edema, as well as improving 
neurological functions. At the molecular level, treatment with BMSC‑CM resulted 
in a marked elevation in the expression of GAP‑43 and interleukin (IL)‑10, in 
addition to a significant reduction in the expression levels of IL‑1β, tumor 
necrosis factor‑α and IL‑6. Following application of a 
phosphorylated‑extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor, 
PD98059, in a BMSC‑CM rat model, the mRNA and protein expression levels of 
GAP‑43 were significantly attenuated. Therefore, the findings of the present 
study demonstrated that treatment with BMSC‑CM may be an alternative to direct 
BMSC transplantation in a rat model of ICH. The mechanism underlying 
BMSC‑CM‑mediated neuroprotection may be associated with anti-inflammatory 
effects, as well as activation of GAP‑43 transcription and expression through 
ERK‑1/2 phosphorylation. Therefore, the ERK-1/2-GAP-43 signaling pathway may be 
considered a potential novel application target of BMSC‑CM for the treatment of 
neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: Centenarians are the fastest rising age group in Ireland. Hip 
fractures most commonly affect older adults and are associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality, as well as the financial cost of healthcare resources. 
Despite this, very little is known regarding hip fractures in centenarians. The 
aim of this study was to investigate our experience with hip fractures in this 
group and to record the cost of treating these fractures to identify both the 
social and economic impact these injuries impose on the health system.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective data review at a major trauma centre. 
Nine proximal femoral fractures from June 2010-2016 were identified through a 
stepwise analysis of theatre data and patient notes. Time of death was recorded 
directly from patient records or by contacting the patient's general 
practitioner. With the assistance of the hospital finance department, individual 
inpatient costs were calculated using length of stay, theatre time and implant 
costs.
RESULTS: Over the 7-year period we examined nine patients over 100 years of age 
were managed operatively for hip fractures with an average inpatient cost of 
€14,898. The mean age at the time of fracture was 101 years and 7 months. Eight 
of the patients were female and there was one male. Our inpatient, 30-day and 
1-year mortality rate were 22, 22, and 71%.
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year mortality rate of any person aged 100 years or older is 
thought to be 67% for men and 59% for women. This suggests that the 1-year 
mortality rate of 71% in this current study is only slightly worse than the 
usual life expectancy of a person older than 100 years of age. Our data suggest 
that the extreme elderly should be offered operative management.

Widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) increased HIV patients' 
life expectancy, however, favored the development of kidney and cardiovascular 
diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) 
damage and its association with renal function in HIV patients receiving cART. 
This is a cross-sectional study with HIV-infected patients with no renal and 
cardiovascular disease, recruited in public health centers in Brazil. Clinical 
and laboratory parameters of HIV patients were compared according to cART use 
and with a healthy control group. Blood ICAM-1 and syndecan-1 levels were 
quantified by ELISA kit. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 
evaluated. A total of 69 HIV patients were included, with mean age of 33.4 ± 8.9 
years, and 77.3% were male. Serum urea, creatinine, and eGFR were similar in all 
groups. No HIV patient had decreased GFR <60 ml/min. All HIV patients had higher 
systemic syndecan-1 compared with healthy controls (71.8 ± 25.4 ng/ml vs. 
36.5 ± 14.3 ng/ml, p < .001). Syndecan-1 showed a significant positive 
correlation with serum creatinine (r = 0.437, p = .001), serum urea levels 
(r = 0.352, p = .006), and a negative correlation with eGFR (r = -0.315, 
p = .015) in HIV patients. Syndecan-1 remained independently associated with 
serum creatinine and reduced GFR even after we forced variables related with HIV 
infection status, tenofovir use, treatment time, dyslipidemia, and others in a 
multivariate analysis. HIV patients using cART with no clinical renal and 
cardiovascular disease presented eGC damage and it is associated with clinical 
markers of kidney dysfunction. Syndecan-1 may be a useful early biomarker to 
monitoring renal dysfunction in HIV patients in chronic use of cART. Further 
research is needed to evaluate this applicability.

BACKGROUND: Plants have been known as an integral part of traditional medicine 
because of their phytoconstituents with their miraculous substances. Tinospora 
cordifolia (Guduchi/ Giloy) is one such plant having pharmacological functions 
and medicinal values due to its several constituents such as terpenes, 
glycosides, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids. Thus, it has been rightly 
mentioned in old texts as "Amrita".
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present review is to extend the current 
knowledge, importance and beneficial pharmacological applications of guduchi in 
humans for safeguarding various health issues.
METHODS: We extensively reviewed, analyzed and compiled salient information from 
the published literature available in PubMed and other scientific databases.
RESULTS: The present review describes medicinal applications of T. cordifolia in 
countering various disorders and usages as anti-oxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, 
antihyperlipidemic, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular protective, 
neuroprotective, osteoprotective, radioprotective, anti-anxiety, adaptogenic 
agent, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, a thrombolytic agent, 
anti-diarrheal, anti-ulcer, anti-microbial and anti-cancer agent. The plant is 
also a source of micronutrients viz. copper, calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and 
manganese. A special focus has been made on its health benefits in treating 
endocrine and metabolic disorders and its potential as an immune booster. 
Several patents have been filed and granted to inventions encompassing T. 
cordifolia as a major component of therapeutics for ameliorating metabolic, 
endocrinal and several other ailments, aiding in the betterment of human life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The information presented would be beneficial for researchers, 
medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies to design and develop 
effective medicines, drugs and healthical products exploiting the multiple as 
well as specific modes of actions of T. cordifolia, and also help in promoting 
and popularizing this rich herb having promising potentials to prevent and treat 
various ailments.

Cuban Studies.

The senescence of the immune system and the risk of cancer increase with aging. 
Age itself entails changes in the immune system, which are related to a decrease 
in thymic output of naïve lymphocytes, an accumulation of chronic antigenic 
load, notably chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 
replicative senescence of lymphocytes. These changes could eventually contribute 
to cancer risk and affect the response to cancer treatment. However, several 
confounding factors make it difficult to draw a picture of causal relationships. 
Studies in diverse human populations could contribute to clarify these complex 
relationships. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about the senescence of 
the T cells, the relationship with CMV infection, cancer, and cancer treatment. 
We also review the results of a series of studies performed in Cuba whose 
population is characterized by the unusual combination of long life expectancy 
and high antigenic load, including high seroprevalence of CMV, typical of 
tropical countries. Although immunosenescence affects almost all components and 
functions of the immune response, its most salient feature is a decrease in 
numbers and proportions of naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes and an accretion of 
terminally differentiated CD8+ T lymphocytes. These features were confirmed by 
the Cuban studies, but interestingly a clear gender effect also appeared. 
Moreover, as aging is a global phenomenon, a fast increase in elderly with 
malignancies is expected; therefore, the evaluation of patient's immune status 
would support the decision of treating them with immunotherapy and predict the 
efficacy of such treatments, thereby improving benefits for the patients.

BACKGROUND: Short-term mortality after invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and 
pneumococcal pneumonia is high but data on long-term mortality (including the 
comparison between bacteremic and non-invasive/non-bacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia) within the first years after diagnosis are scarce.
METHODS: Adult patients with 'non-pneumonia' IPD and 'invasive pneumonia' (from 
2004 to 2012) and with 'bacteremic' vs 'non-invasive/non-bacteremic (NI/NB)' 
pneumococcal pneumonia (from 2008 to 2012) diagnosed by negative blood culture 
but a positive urinary antigen test (UAT) were identified in a Dutch hospital. 
Mortality of patients up to 10years after diagnosis was compared with age- and 
sex-matched life-expectancy data of the general population. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis was used to study predictors for mortality in invasive 
pneumonia patients and to adjust for confounders comparing mortality between 
bacteremic and NI/NB/UAT-positive pneumonia patients.
RESULTS: Of 228 invasive pneumonia patients 17% died within 30days and in 30-day 
survivors cumulative long-term mortality at 1 and 5years were 16% and 39% as 
compared with 3% and 15% in age- and sex-matched persons. High mortality was 
largely dependent on pre-existent comorbidities. In invasive pneumonia patients 
who survived the first 30days, age, male gender, chronic cardiovascular disease, 
malignancy and PCV7 serotype disease were independent predictors for higher 
long-term mortality. For bacteremic pneumonia patients (n=128) 30-day mortality 
was 16% and almost similar to 14% in NI/NB/UAT-positive pneumococcal pneumonia 
patients (n=170). In 30-day survivors of bacteremic pneumonia (n=108, median age 
66years), cumulative mortality at 1 and 3years were 13% and 29% as compared with 
18% and 40% in NI/NB/UAT-positive pneumococcal pneumonia patients (n=146, median 
age 67years) without a significant difference in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 40% of all patients, who survived the first 30days 
after presentation with non-pneumonia IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia died within 
the following 5years. High long-term mortality was largely dependent on 
pre-existent comorbidity.

Several unconventional myosins contain a highly charged single α helix (SAH) 
immediately following the calmodulin (CaM) binding IQ motifs, functioning to 
extend lever arms of these myosins. How such SAH is connected to the IQ motifs 
and whether the conformation of the IQ motifs-SAH segments are regulated by Ca2+ 
fluctuations are not known. Here, we demonstrate by solving its crystal 
structure that the predicted SAH of myosin VIIa (Myo7a) forms a stable SAH. The 
structure of Myo7a IQ5-SAH segment in complex with apo-CaM reveals that the SAH 
sequence can extend the length of the Myo7a lever arm. Although Ca2+-CaM remains 
bound to IQ5-SAH, the Ca2+-induced CaM binding mode change softens the 
conformation of the IQ5-SAH junction, revealing a Ca2+-induced lever arm 
flexibility change for Myo7a. We further demonstrate that the last IQ motif of 
several other myosins also binds to both apo- and Ca2+-CaM, suggesting a common 
Ca2+-induced conformational regulation mechanism.

    Lancet HIV. 2017 Jun;4(6):e236-e237.

BACKGROUND: We sought to understand whether people living with HIV (PLHIV) ever 
on highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) follow a pattern where morbidity 
is compressed into the last years of life or lessened as people age. We aimed to 
estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) among adults living with and 
without HIV, and examine dependency between causes of comorbidities.
METHODS: The Comparative Outcomes and Service Utilization Trends (COAST) study 
is a retrospective cohort of adults (≥20 years) including all known PLHIV and a 
10% random sample of the general population of British Columbia, and with 
longitudinal data spanning from April 1, 1996, to Dec 31, 2012. We determined 
the prevalence of select comorbidities (cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, and 
renal diseases, and non-AIDS defining cancers because of their high prevalence 
among PLHIV) by age and sex by use of case-finding algorithms. Deaths were 
obtained from a vital event registry from British Columbia, Canada. 
Comorbid-specific HALE was estimated from 20 years of age by HIV status and sex. 
For each comorbidity, a healthy state was defined as the proportion of life 
expectancy comorbid-free, and was adjusted on the probability of occurrence of 
other different comorbidities. The sensitivity of HALE estimates was assessed to 
the sequencing of select comorbidities for the dependent comorbidity 
adjustments.
FINDINGS: Our sample consisted of electronic health records from 9310 
HIV-infected and 510 313 uninfected adults over the period April 1, 1996, to Dec 
31, 2012. These individuals contributed 49 605 deaths and 5 576 841 person-years 
over the study period. At exactly age 20 years, HALE was about 31 years (SD 
0·16) among men living with HIV and 27 years (0·16) among women living with HIV. 
In the HIV-negative population, HALE was around 58 years (SD 0·02) for men and 
63 years (0·02) for women. These results seem independent of ordering. However, 
PLHIV, particularly women living with HIV, had much shorter overall life 
expectancies than did their HIV-negative counterparts in the general population 
[29·1 years (SD 0·1) vs 65·4 years (0·1)], and thus spent less time in a healthy 
state.
INTERPRETATION: Although we noted little differences in the levels of morbidity 
compression by HIV status, PLHIV-especially women living with HIV-spent less 
time in a healthy state. Expanded service delivery interventions to address 
complex care needs of ageing PLHIV are crucial to address shorter life 
expectancies, and improve their healthy states.

BACKGROUND: No high-quality trials have provided evidence of effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment adherence intervention strategies. We 
therefore examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Adherence 
Improving self-Management Strategy (AIMS) compared with treatment as usual.
METHODS: We did a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled 
trial in seven HIV clinics at academic and non-academic hospitals in the 
Netherlands. Eligible participants were patients with HIV who were either 
treatment experienced (ie, with ≥9 months on combination antiretroviral therapy 
[ART] and at risk of viral rebound) or treatment-naive patients initiating their 
first combination ART regimen. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either 
AIMS or treatment as usual (ie, containing a range of common adherence 
intervention strategies) using a computer-generated randomisation table. 
Randomisation was stratified by treatment experience (experienced vs naive) and 
included block randomisation at nurse level with randomly ordered blocks of size 
four, six, and eight. 21 HIV nurses from the participating clinics received 
three training sessions of 6 h each (18 h in total) on AIMS and a 1·5 h booster 
training session at the clinic (two to three nurses per session) after each 
nurse had seen two to three patients. AIMS was delivered by nurses during 
routine clinic visits. We did mixed-effects, intent-to-treat analyses to examine 
treatment effects on the primary outcome of log10 viral load collected at months 
5, 10, and 15. The viral load results were exponentiated (with base 10) for 
easier interpretation. Using cohort data from 7347 Dutch patients with HIV to 
calculate the natural course of illness, we developed a lifetime Markov model to 
estimate the primary economic outcome of lifetime societal costs per 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. This trial is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01429142).
FINDINGS: We recruited participants between Sept 1, 2011, and April 2, 2013; the 
last patient completed the study on June 16, 2014. The intent-to-treat sample 
comprised 221 patients; 109 assigned to AIMS and 112 to treatment as usual. 
Across the three timepoints (months 5, 10, and 15), log viral load was 1·26 
times higher (95% CI 1·04-1·52) in the treatment-as-usual group (estimated 
marginal mean 44·5 copies per mL [95% CI 35·5-55·9]) than in the AIMS group 
(estimated marginal mean 35·4 copies per mL [29·9-42·0]). Additionally, AIMS was 
cost-effective (ie, dominant: cheaper and more effective) since it reduced 
lifetime societal costs by €592 per patient and increased QALYs by 0·034 per 
patient.
INTERPRETATION: Findings from preparatory studies have shown that AIMS is 
acceptable, feasible to deliver in routine care, and has reproducible effects on 
medication adherence. In this study, AIMS reduced viral load, increased QALYs, 
and saved resources. Implementation of AIMS in routine clinical HIV care is 
therefore recommended.

Nitazoxanide (NTZ) induces autophagy in mammalian cells and also has 
mycobactericidal activity, displaying a two-pronged therapeutic effect, on the 
host as well as the pathogen. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 
inhaled NTZ were investigated. Particles containing NTZ in a matrix of PLGA were 
prepared by spray drying. HPLC and LC-MS/MS methods were developed and 
validated. Particles were administered as inhalations to mice. Drug 
concentrations in plasma and tissues were estimated at different time points. 
Drug loading (∼36%), entrapment efficiency (>90%), and the conversion of NTZ 
into metabolites in plasma and lung homogenates were assessed satisfactorily by 
HPLC. NTZ pharmacokinetics and biodistribution following intravenous 
administration or inhalation were established by LC-MS. NTZ converted into 
tizoxanide (99% in 30 min) and other metabolites. Pulmonary delivery of NTZ 
entrapped in particles increased the half-life of the drug by factors of 3, 12, 
and 200 in the plasma, lung tissue, and alveolar macrophages, respectively. 
Targeted delivery and prolonged lung retention along with dose sparing of the 
kidneys was observed upon pulmonary delivery as compared to intravenous 
administration.

Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Due to increased average life expectancy, the number of elderly 
patients requiring complex reconstructive microsurgical procedures is rising. 
Age, comorbid conditions, and location of operation are all possible risk 
factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical outcomes to set the right 
criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2014, the data of 30 patients over the 
age of 70, who were treated with microsurgical techniques in our clinic, were 
extracted from patient records and analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: In this patient population, flap success rate was 94%. Systemic and 
surgical complication rates were 40% and 48%, respectively. Complication rates 
were higher in head and neck cases but there was no statistically significant 
difference compared to reconstructions in other areas. Loss of oral lining, as a 
serious complication, had no effect on complications in head and neck 
reconstruction patients in our series. Conclusions: Flap success is comparable 
to younger age groups but procedures are associated with a high rate of 
complications Evaluating and controlling comorbid conditions is important. The 
American Society of Anesthesiologists scoring system is reliable in this patient 
population. Although complications are more common, these procedures can be 
performed safely in elderly populations with careful patient selection.

People living in Africa face a heavy and wide-ranging burden of disease that 
takes an incalculable toll on social and economic development as well as 
shortening life expectancy (life expectancy in Tanzania is about 60 vs. about 80 
in the United States and Europe. Further, the pharmaceutical market in 
developing countries is immature and may not support quality medicines. In many 
cases, a tender system is used, and medicines are bought by the government at 
the lowest price. In addition to access to medicines, a number of pharmaceutical 
sciences problems are apparent. The availability of infrastructure and 
especially standard instruments such as HPLC and X-ray diffraction is minimal. 
Additionally, there is an important need to increase access to advanced 
education for men and women in Africa, especially access to state-of-the-art 
scientific education. Utilizing the mandate of Nelson Mandela, Purdue's 
conceptual approach has been to utilize education to combat these problems.

Parapoynx crisonalis is an important pest of many aquatic vegetables including 
water chestnuts. Understanding the relationship between temperature variations 
and the population growth rates of P. crisonalis is essential to predicting its 
population dynamics in water chestnuts ponds. These relationships were examined 
in this study based on the age-stage, two-sex life table of P. crisonalis 
developed in the laboratory at 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36°C. The results showed 
that the values of Sxj (age-stage-specific survival rate), fxj 
(age-stage-specific fecundity), lx (age specific survival rate) and mx 
(age-specific fecundity) increased as the temperature rose from 21 to 27°C, then 
decreased from 30 to 36°C. Temperature also had a significant effect on the net 
reproductive rate (R0), gross reproductive rate (GRR), intrinsic rate of 
increase (r) and finite rate of increase (λ). The value of these parameters were 
at low levels at 21, 33, and 36°C. Further, the r value decreased as the 
temperature rose from 24 to 30°C, while the GRR reached its highest level at 
27°C. The results indicated that optimal growth and development of P. crisonalis 
occurred at temperatures between 24°C to 30°C when compared to the lowest 
temperature (21°C) and higher temperatures of 33°C and 36°C.

Bone Cement-Augmented Percutaneous Screw Fixation for Malignant Spinal 
Metastases: Is It Feasible?

(1)Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, 
Korea.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the validity of bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw 
fixation for treating malignant spinal metastases.
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2015, 14 patients (eight men and six women) who 
underwent bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation for malignant spinal 
metastases were enrolled in this study. Their life expectancy was considered to 
be more than one month and less than one year, based on the revised Tokuhashi 
scoring system. Clinical findings including the back pain scale score, 
functional outcome, procedure related complications, and survival were assessed 
preoperatively, postoperatively, and then six months after the procedure.
RESULTS: Twelve of the patients (86%) survived up to six months after the 
procedure. Three required mini-open decompressive laminectomy for severe 
epidural compression. Bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation was 
performed one level above, one level below, and at the pathologic level itself. 
The mean operation time was 60 minutes (45-180) and blood loss was less than 100 
mL. Prior to surgery, the mean pain score on the visual analogue scale was 8.8, 
while one month after the procedure, it had reduced to 3.0; this improvement was 
maintained until the six-month assessment in the surviving patients. All 
patients were able to sit within the first two days after surgery, and no 
patient experienced neurological deterioration at the one-month follow up after 
the surgery. No patient experienced screw loosening during the six months of 
follow-up. Asymptomatic cement leakage into the epidural space was observed in 
two patients, but no major complications were observed.
CONCLUSION: For selected patients with malignant spinal metastases, bone 
cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation can provide significant pain relief 
and improve quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung 
cancer and remains an important cause of cancer death worldwide. Platinum-based 
chemotherapy (PBC) for NSCLC can modify outcome while the risk of cardiotoxicity 
remains poorly researched. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and severity of 
cardiac injury during PBC in patients with NSCLC and to identify patients at 
risk.
METHODS: This was a single-centre, prospective, observational study of patients 
with early and advanced stage NSCLC referred for PBC. In addition to standard 
care, patients were examined and evaluated for cardiotoxicity before the first 
dose (visit 1), at the last dose (visit 2) and 6 months after the last dose of 
PBC (visit 3). Cardiotoxicity (at visit 2 and 3) was defined as increase in the 
ultrasensitive troponin T, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide or decrease 
in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients (mean age 61 ± 9; 54% men; 68% advanced lung 
cancer) were included. The median number of PBC cycles was 4. During the study 
period, there were no incidents of heart failure, and 3 deaths caused by tumour 
progression were recorded. The mean values of biomarkers and LVEF did not change 
significantly (p > 0.20). However, 10 (25%) had cardiotoxicity which was 
independently associated with a history of ischemic heart disease (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: In NSCLC, cardiac assessment and lifestyle modifications may be 
pursued in patients with a history of cardiac disease and in patients with 
longer life expectancy.
