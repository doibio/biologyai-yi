body mass-based squat movement in physically frail elders.
METHODS: Fourteen men and women aged 75 to 88 years who used the long-term care 
insurance system participated in the 12-week training program (48 reps/session, 
3 sessions/week). Isometric knee extension torque (KET) during a maximum 
voluntary contraction (MVC) and electromyogram (EMG) activities of the rectus 
femoris and vastus lateralis muscles during the MVC and a body mass-based squat 
task were determined at baseline, and following 4 and 12 weeks training. KET was 
expressed relative to body mass (KET/BM) and EMG activities during the squat 
task were normalized to that during a MVC and averaged (QF %EMGmax).
RESULTS: KET/BM increased from 1.07 ± 0.28 Nm/kg at baseline to 
1.26 ± 0.26 Nm/kg at week 4 and 1.31 ± 0.28 Nm/kg at week 12 (P < 0.001), and QF 
%EMGmax decreased from 67.2 ± 17.2% to 49.3% at week 4 (P < 0.001) and 
43.5 ± 7.7% at week 12 (P = 0.016). At each of the three measurement time points 
KET/BM was inversely correlated with QF %EMGmax (r = -0.78 to -0.86, P ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSION: For physically frail elders, a short-term conditioning program 
consisting of repeated sit-to-stand exercise is effective in increasing knee 
extensor strength and reducing the muscular effort required for lowering and 
raising the body.

BACKGROUND: Effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved life 
expectancy among people living with HIV-1 infection. Treated HIV-1infection 
increases the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS). Despite sub-Saharan Africa 
having among the highest rates of HIV-1 infection, the effects of MS in 
HIV-1-infected individuals on cardiovascular risk is poorly explored. The aim of 
the study was to assess whether MS and/or HIV-1 treatment correlates with large 
elastic artery stiffness in HIV-1-infected patients treated with first-line 
cART.
METHODS: The study sample comprised of 102 subjects free of cardiovascular 
disease and major risk factors divided into two groups based on HIV-1 infection, 
treatment, and MS status: HIV-1+/cART+/MS+ (n = 12); HIV-1+/cART-/MS+ (n = 16); 
HIV-1-/ MS+ (n = 10); HIV-1+/cART+/MS- (n = 42); HIV-1+/cART-/MS- (n = 32); 
HIV-1-/ MS- (n = 39). MS was established according the International Diabetes 
Federation definition. Large artery stiffness was measured using applanation 
tonometry to assess aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and aortic augmentation 
index at heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@HR75). cART included lamivudine/zidovudine 
and nevirapine or efavirenz.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MS in the HIV-1-infected patients was 28%. There were 
no significant differences in aPWV in the non-MS groups. However, in subjects 
with MS, aPWV was significantly higher in the HIV-1 cART patients 
(9.0 ± 1.9 m/s) compared with both controls (7.5 ± 1.8 m/s; P = 0.018) and 
untreated HIV-1 patients (7.7 ± 1.3 m/s; P = 0.023), and these differences 
remained after adjustment for blood pressure and sex. Aortic PWV was 
significantly elevated (P = 0.009) in HIV-1 cART patients with MS compared to 
their counterparts without MS. Untreated HIV-1 patients with MS also 
demonstrated increased aPWV compared to their counterparts without MS 
(P = 0.05). Aortic AIx@HR75 was, on average, ~ 5% higher in HIV-1 cART patients 
with MS (28.3 ± 62% compared with untreated HIV-1 patients with MS (23.5 ± 9%; 
P = 0.075). Sub-group multivariate analysis identified MS as an independent 
predictor of increased aPWV in HIV-1 cART patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study established that presence of MS in HIV-1 patients on 
treatment was associated with increased aPWV and hence increased arterial 
stiffness in sub-Saharan African HIV-1 patients on first-line cART.

The use of indicator species to test for environmental stability and functioning 
is a widespread practice. In aquatic systems, several daphniids (Cladocera: 
Daphniidae) are commonly used as indicator species; registration of new 
pesticides are mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency to be accompanied 
by daphniid toxicity data. This reliance upon a few species to infer ecosystem 
health and function assumes similar responses to toxicants across species with 
potentially very different life histories and susceptibility. Incorporating 
lab-derived life-history data into a simple mathematical model, we explore the 
reliability of three different daphniid species as surrogates for each other by 
comparing their responses to reductions in survivorship and fecundity after 
simulated exposure to toxicants. Our results demonstrate that daphniid species' 
responses to toxicant exposure render them poor surrogates for one another, 
highlighting that caution should be exercised in using a surrogate approach to 
the use of indicator species in risk assessment.

Advance directives emerged in the 1960s with the goal of empowering people to 
exert control over their future medical decisions. However, it has become 
apparent, over recent years, that advance directives do not sufficiently capture 
the temporal and relational aspects of planning treatment and care. Advance care 
planning (ACP) has been suggested as a way to emphasise communication between 
the patient, their surrogate decision maker and healthcare professional(s) in 
order to anticipate healthcare decisions in the event that the patient loses 
decision-making capacity, either temporarily or permanently. In more and more 
countries, ACP has become common practice in planning the treatment of terminal 
diseases such as cancer or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, even though 
neurodegenerative dementia results in the gradual loss of decision-making 
capacity, ACP is still extremely rare. There are several reasons for this. 
Firstly, some people have difficulties talking about illness and death, 
especially when this involves anticipation. Secondly, lay people and 
professionals alike struggle to consider Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and similar 
forms of dementia as terminal diseases. Thirdly, although patient 
decision-making capacity gradually decreases with the progression of dementia, 
the patient retains the ability to communicate and interact with surrogates and 
professionals until the later stages of the disease. Therefore, surrogates and 
professionals may feel unsure or even ambivalent when enforcing advance 
directives, in particular when those decisions may shorten a patient&rsquo;s 
life expectancy. Finally, to be effective, existing ACP interventions should be 
adapted to patient&rsquo;s cognitive impairments and lay out dementia-specific 
scenarios. Current WHO estimates indicate that by 2050 one out of four people 
will potentially have to take care of a relative with cognitive and 
communication impairments for several years. In Switzerland, the Federal Office 
of Public Health and the regional states have established national strategies on 
dementia and palliative care. These strategies emphasise the need for ACP as a 
means to prepare patients and their relatives for future decisions, as soon as 
someone is diagnosed with dementia. This moment is thus especially conducive to 
develop appropriate processes to prompt the elderly and people diagnosed with 
dementia to engage in ACP. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to 
identify the benefits and challenges of ACP in dementia care, outline strategies 
to design appropriate procedures and tools, and provide professionals, patients 
and their relatives with opportunities to engage in ACP.

Lymphatic filariasis causes global morbidity. Wolbachia, an endo-symbiotic 
intracellular bacterium of the filarial nematode helps in their growth and 
development, regulates fecundity in female worms and contributes to the 
immunopathogenesis of the disease. However, genes and proteins of Wolbachia that 
may act as putative vaccine candidates are not known. In this study, we cloned 
recombinase-A protein of Wolbachia from Brugia malayi (wBmRecA) and carried out 
its detailed biochemical and immunological characterization. Bioinformatics 
analysis, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectral studies showed 
significant sequence and structural similarities between wBmRecA and RecA of 
other alpha-proteo- bacterial species. wBmRecA was ubiquitously expressed in all 
the three major life stages of B. malayi, including excretory-secretory products 
of the adult worm. In silico studies suggested immunogenic potential of wBmRecA, 
and mice immunized with wBmRecA exhibited elevated levels of immunoglobulins 
IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in their serum along with increased percentages of 
CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in their spleens. Notably, splenocytes from 
immunized mice showed increased m-RNA expression of T-bet, elevated 
proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12, while peritoneal MФs exhibited 
increased levels of iNOS, downregulated Arg-1 and secreted copious amounts of 
nitric oxide which contributed to severely impaired development of the infective 
larvae (Bm-L3). Interestingly, sera from immunized mice promoted significant 
cellular adherence and cytotoxicity against microfilariae and Bm-L3. 
Importantly, wBmRecA demonstrated strong immuno-reactivity with bancroftian sera 
from endemic normal individuals. These results suggest that wBmRecA is highly 
immunogenic, and should be explored further as a putative vaccine candidate 
against lymphatic filariasis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that are involved in the 
post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. miRNAs modulate 
lifespan and the aging process in a variety of organisms. In this study, we 
identified a role of miR-83 in regulating lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. 
mir-83 mutants exhibited extended lifespan, and the overexpression of miR-83 was 
sufficient to decrease the prolonged lifespan of the mutants. We observed 
upregulation of the expression levels of a set of miR-83 target genes in young 
mir-83 mutant adults; while different sets of genes were upregulated in older 
mir-83 mutant adults. In vivo assays showed that miR-83 regulated expression of 
target genes including din-1, spp-9 and col-178, and we demonstrated that daf-16 
and din-1 were required for the extension of lifespan in the mir-83 mutants. The 
regulation of din-1 by miR-83 during aging resulted in the differential 
expression of din-1 targets such as gst-4 and gst-10. In daf-2 mutants, the 
expression level of miR-83 was significantly reduced compared to wild-type 
animals. We identified a role for miR-83 in modulating lifespan in C. elegans 
and provided molecular insights into its functional mechanism.

Female and male life expectancies have converged in most industrialized 
societies in recent decades. To achieve coherent forecasts between females and 
males, this convergence needs to be considered when forecasting sex-specific 
mortality. We introduce a model forecasting a matrix of the age-specific death 
rates of sex ratio, decomposed into two age profiles and time indices-before and 
after age 45-using principal component analysis. Our model allows visualization 
of both age structure and general level over time of sex differences in 
mortality for these two age groups. Based on a prior forecast for females, we 
successfully forecast male mortality convergence with female mortality. The 
usefulness of the developed model is illustrated by its comparison with other 
coherent and independent models in an out-of-sample forecast evaluation for 18 
countries. The results show that the new proposal outperformed the other models 
for most countries.

Orchids are generally regarded as plants with an insignificant invasive 
potential and so far only one species has proved to be harmful for native flora. 
However, previous studies on Epipactis helleborine and Arundina graminifolia 
indicate that the ecological aspects of range extension in their non-native 
geographical range are not the same for all species of orchids. Disa bracteata 
in its native range, South Africa, is categorized as of little concern in terms 
of conservation whereas in Australia it is naturalized and considered to be an 
environmental weed. The aim of this research was to determine the ecological 
preferences enabling the spread of Disa bracteata in Western and South 
Australia, Victoria and Tasmania and to evaluate the effect of future climate 
change on its potential range. The ecological niche modeling approach indicates 
that most of the accessible areas are already occupied by this species but 
future expansion will continue based on four climate change scenarios (rcp26, 
rcp45, rcp60, rcp85). Further expansion is predicted especially in eastern 
Australia and eastern Tasmania. Moreover, there are some unpopulated but 
suitable habitats in New Zealand, which according to climate change scenarios 
will become even more suitable in the future. The most striking result of this 
study is the significant difference between the environmental conditions 
recorded in the areas which D. bracteata naturally inhabits and invasive 
sites-that indicates a possible niche shift. In Australia the studied species 
continues to populate a new niche or exploit habitats that are only moderately 
represented in South Africa.

Previous research has shown that demographics, beliefs, and self-reported own 
health influence TTO values. Our hypothesis is that attitudes towards length and 
quality of life influence TTO values, but should no longer affect a set of 
related choices that are based on respondents' own TTO scores. A representative 
sample of 1339 respondents was asked their level of agreement to four statements 
relating to the importance of quality and length of life. Respondents then went 
on to value 4 EQ-5D 5L states using an online interactive survey and a related 
set of 6 pairwise health-related choice questions, set up, so that respondents 
should be indifferent between choice options. We explored the impact of 
attitudes using regression analysis for TTO values and a logit model for 
choices. TTO values were correlated with the attitudes and were found to have a 
residual impact on the choices. In particular, those respondents who preferred 
quality of life over length of life gave less weight to the differences in years 
and more weight to differences in quality of life in these choice. We conclude 
that although the TTO responses reflect attitudes, these attitudes continue to 
affect health-related choices.

BACKGROUND: The USA ranks last in life expectancy among high-income countries. 
Since 2000, excess US mortality has been particularly concentrated in the 
working ages, which are also the ages hardest hit by the increase in drug 
deaths. This study measures the effect of drug-related mortality on the gap in 
life expectancy between the USA and other countries.
METHODS: Data from the Human Mortality Database and the World Health 
Organization were combined to construct age-standardized mortality rates for 
2000-14 in 12 high-income countries and the USA for seven broad causes of death, 
including drug use. The contribution of each cause to the difference in life 
expectancy between the USA and the other 12 countries was estimated.
RESULTS: In 2014, the increase in drug-related deaths accounted for 10-15% of 
the US disadvantage in mortality, but with marked differences by age group. For 
working-age men, the increase in drug-related deaths accounted for up to 38% of 
the difference. Overall, American mortality is higher than the comparison 
countries across a wide range of causes.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the drug epidemic appears to be specific to the 
USA, but it only partly contributes to the American shortfall in mortality.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2019 Feb 19;170(4):264-265.

BACKGROUND: The ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an 
Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial included 
participants with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Compared with participants 
receiving statins alone, those receiving a statin plus alirocumab had lower 
rates of a composite outcome including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and 
death.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of alirocumab in these 
circumstances.
DESIGN: Decision analysis using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model.
DATA SOURCES: Data sources representative of the United States combined with 
data from the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults with a recent first MI and a baseline low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol level of 1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health system.
INTERVENTION: Alirocumab or ezetimibe added to statin therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2018 U.S. dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with a statin alone, the addition of 
ezetimibe cost $81 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], $51 000 to $215 000) per 
QALY. Compared with a statin alone, the addition of alirocumab cost $308 000 
(UI, $197 000 to $678 000) per QALY. Compared with the combination of statin and 
ezetimibe, replacing ezetimibe with alirocumab cost $997 000 (UI, $254 000 to 
dominated) per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The price of alirocumab would have to decrease 
from its original cost of $14 560 to $1974 annually to be cost-effective 
relative to ezetimibe.
LIMITATION: Effectiveness estimates were based on a single randomized trial with 
a median follow-up of 2.8 years and should not be extrapolated to patients with 
stable coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSION: The price of alirocumab would have to be reduced considerably to be 
cost-effective. Because substantial reductions already have occurred, we believe 
that timely, independent cost-effectiveness analyses can inform clinical and 
policy discussions of new drugs as they enter the market.

AIM: Mayr's central-peripheral population model (CCPM) describes the marked 
differences between central and peripheral populations in genetic diversity, 
gene flow, and census size. When isolation leads to genetic divergence, these 
peripheral populations have high evolutionary value and can influence 
biogeographic patterns. In tropical marine species with pelagic larvae, powerful 
western-boundary currents have great potential to shape the genetic 
characteristics of peripheral populations at latitudinal extremes. We tested for 
the genetic patterns expected by the CCPM in peripheral populations that are 
located within the Kuroshio Current for the Indo-Pacific reef fish, Caesio 
cuning.
METHODS: We used a panel of 2,677 SNPs generated from restriction 
site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to investigate genetic diversity, 
relatedness, effective population size, and spatial patterns of population 
connectivity from central to peripheral populations of C. cuning along the 
Kuroshio Current.
RESULTS: Principal component and cluster analyses indicated a genetically 
distinct lineage at the periphery of the C. cuning species range and examination 
of SNPs putatively under divergent selection suggested potential for local 
adaptation in this region. We found signatures of isolation-by-distance and 
significant genetic differences between nearly all sites. Sites closest to the 
periphery exhibited increased within-population relatedness and decreased 
effective population size.
MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential for homogenizing gene flow along the 
Kuroshio Current, peripheral populations in C. cuning conform to the predictions 
of the CCPM. While oceanography, habitat availability, and dispersal ability are 
all likely to shape the patterns found in C. cuning across this 
central-peripheral junction, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection 
in increasing smaller peripheral populations appear to be probable influences on 
the lineage divergence found in the Ryukyu Islands.

Male age may directly or indirectly affect the fitness of their female mating 
partners and their joint progeny. While in some taxa of insects, old males make 
better mates and fathers, young males excel in others. Males of most social 
Hymenoptera are relatively short lived and because of testis degeneration have 
only a limited sperm supply. In contrast, the wingless fighter males of the ant 
Cardiocondyla obscurior live for several weeks and produce sperm throughout 
their lives. Wingless males engage in lethal combat with rival males and the 
winner of such fights can monopolize mating with all female sexuals that emerge 
in their nests over a prolonged timespan. Here, we investigate if male age has 
an influence on sperm quality, the queen's lifespan and productivity, and the 
size and weight of their offspring. Queens mated to one-week or six-week-old 
males did not differ in life expectancy and offspring production, but the 
daughters of young males were slightly heavier than those of old males. Our data 
suggest negligible reproductive senescence of C. obscurior males even at an age, 
which only few of them reach. This matches the reproductive strategy of 
Cardiocondyla ants, in which freshly emerging female sexuals rarely have the 
option to mate with males other than the one present in their natal nest.

Complexities of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) and why it is not 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is currently being investigated as 
a procedural alternative to surgical mitral valve repair or replacement (SMVR). 
Early data from first-in-man trials with current devices suggest that TMVR is 
technically feasible but carries a high mortality. This is substantially 
different from the early success transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
has seen and is related to complexities of the mitral valve anatomy, differences 
in pathology that require mitral valve replacement as well as the impact that 
mitral valve replacement has on physiology and cardiac function, irrespective of 
the modality by which the mitral valve is replaced. Importantly, in the case of 
TAVR, a less invasive method is offered to accomplish the same as the 
traditional surgical intervention. On the other hand, valve replacement is not 
the recommended treatment option for the majority of mitral valve disease, and 
in fact is avoided whenever possible during surgery given the shortened life 
expectancy and increased morbidity with mitral valve replacement. Another 
distinction between TAVR and TMVR is the etiology and natural progression of the 
underlying disease and driving factors for intervention that are vastly 
different between aortic and mitral valve disease. The primary aortic disease 
treated has been aortic stenosis, which has several etiologic factors that cause 
a similar physiologic dysfunction and risk. Aortic valve replacement leads to 
improved survival and quality of life. The primary mitral valve disease targeted 
is regurgitation, which occurs as a primary valve defect and as a secondary 
consequence of ventricular dysfunction. Primary mitral regurgitation is treated 
by valve repair with excellent long-term outcomes. Secondary regurgitation has 
poor long-term outcomes with current commonly used repair techniques and limited 
data exists showing that correction of the regurgitation improves survival. 
Adoption of TMVR will require overcoming the anatomic challenges as well as 
generating data that supports improved survival and/or quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing life expectancy in women and having menstrual problems 
and hormone-associated complications have led people to use complementary and 
alternative medicine. In menopause, the reduction in estrogen and androgen 
physiologically leads to a decrease in blood flow in the volvuleous and vaginal 
zone, resulting in a reduction in sexual desire and arousal. Sexual satisfaction 
plays an important role in mental health. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the effect of Tribulus terrestris on sexual satisfaction in 
postmenopausal women.
METHODS: This double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 2017 with the aim of 
investigating the effect of hydro-alcohol extract of T. terrestris on sexual 
satisfaction of postmenopausal women on 60 women referred to health center 
number 1 in eastern Ahvaz. A total of 60 postmenopausal women were randomly 
assigned into two groups of 30 to receive a syrup containing T. terrestris 
extract at a concentration of 0.9 mg and placebo for 8 weeks. Sexual 
satisfaction was calculated based on Larsson questionnaire. Data were analyzed 
by SPSS software (version 22) and t-test was used for comparing two groups in 
quantitative variables and Chi-square test was used for qualitative variables. P 
value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS: After intervention, the mean of sexual satisfaction in the 
intervention group was significantly higher than in the preintervention group (P 
< 0.005), and a significant increase in sexual satisfaction was observed in the 
tetanus syrup group.
RESULTS: Taking T. terrestris syrup increased sexual satisfaction in 
postmenopausal women.

Life expectancy is influenced by both innate human self-factors and external 
environmental factors. Due to the individual difference of self-factors, the 
external environment impacts on life expectancy are especially important under 
the geoscience perspective. However, few studies discussed impacts of various 
socioeconomic and environmental factors comprehensively, and quantitative 
analysis of multi-factors is lacking. We chose 13 potential factors of 
socio-economy, ecological environment, geological environment and geographical 
environment to quantitatively analyze their impacts and their interactive 
influences on Tibet's life expectancy in 2010 by using geographical detector 
(Geodetector) algorithm, and figure out their suitable ranges or types. Our 
results indicated that the high life expectancy at birth in Tibet are 
distributed like a strip; the main control factor of life expectancy in Tibet is 
socioeconomy, followed by geological environment; furthermore, the highest range 
of socioeconomic factors and the igneous rock exposed areas correspond to the 
maximum value of life expectancy at birth; factors of ecological environment 
have a certain impact on the life expectancy of Tibetan residents, while factors 
of geographical environment have few effects on the life expectancy. Lower 
radiation, moderate temperature and rainfall may have favorable effects on the 
increase in the life expectancy. The life expectancy of Tibet is mainly affected 
by socioeconomy, geological and ecological environment; interactions between 
these factors can increase the impact on the life expectancy of Tibet. 
Consequently, this study can better understand the impact factors of the life 
expectancy in Tibet and could provide a reference basis for local government's 
policy making of relocation and population management.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a disorder which has a powerful impact on the quality 
life and life expectancy despite the increase in drugs and treatments available 
for cancer patients. Moreover, many new therapeutic options are known to have 
adverse reactions without any improvement in outcome than before. Nowadays, 
natural products or plant derivatives are used as chemoprevention drugs and 
chemotherapy is the new approach that uses specific cell premalignant 
transformation in the malignant form. Natural substances derived from plants, 
such as polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, alkaloids and others, can be 
biologically active and have a wide spectrum of effects. The protective effects 
of Saffron carotenoids (crocin and crocetin) have been extensively studied 
mainly for their antioxidant properties, however, they have various other 
biological activities including tumor growth inhibition with the induction of 
cell death.
METHODS: The relevant information on Saffron and its carotenoids was collected 
from scientific databases (such as PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct). To 
identify all published articles in relation to saffron, crocin and crocetin, in 
different types of cancer, no language restriction has been used.
RESULTS: To date, crossing the words saffron and cancer, approximately 150 
articles can be found. If crossing is made between crocin and cancer, 
approximately 60 articles can be found. With the crossing between crocetin and 
cancer, the number is approximately 55, while between carotenoids and cancer, 
the number exceeds 16.000 reports. In all the papers published to date, there 
are evidences that saffron and its carotenoids exert chemopreventive activity 
through anti-oxidant activity, cancer cells apoptosis, inhibition of cell 
proliferation, enhancement of cell differentiation, modulation of cell cycle 
progression and cell growth, modulation of tumor metabolism, stimulation of 
cell-to-cell communication and immune modulation.
CONCLUSION: Here, we have tried to offer an up-to-date overview of pre-clinical 
experimental investigations on the potential use of the main carotenoids of 
saffron in tumor models and focus the attention on the molecular mechanisms 
involved.

patients' treatment.

The use of a quantitative treatment selection marker to choose between two 
treatment options requires the estimate of an optimal threshold above which one 
of these two treatments is preferred. Herein, the optimal threshold expression 
is based on the definition of a utility function which aims to quantify the 
expected utility of the population (e.g. life expectancy, quality of life) by 
taking into account both efficacy (success or failure) and toxicity of each 
treatment option. Therefore, the optimal threshold is the marker value that 
maximizes the expected utility of the population. A method modelling the marker 
distribution in patient subgroups defined by the received treatment and the 
outcome is proposed to calculate the parameters of the utility function so as to 
estimate the optimal threshold and its 95% credible interval using the Bayesian 
inference. The simulation study found that the method had low bias and coverage 
probability close to 95% in multiple settings, but also the need of large sample 
size to estimate the optimal threshold in some settings. The method is then 
applied to the PETACC-8 trial that compares the efficacy of chemotherapy with a 
combined chemotherapy + anti-epidermal growth factor receptor in stage III 
colorectal cancer.

The aims of this study were (1) to describe dietary protein intake, and (2) to 
evaluate the association between dietary protein intake and upper leg muscle 
strength in subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Baseline data from the OA 
was used, in a cross-sectional study. All subjects were diagnosed with 
symptomatic and radiographic knee OA. Daily dietary protein intake was measured 
with the Block Brief 2000 food frequency questionnaire (g/kg body weight). The 
sum of knee flexion and extension strength of the index knee (N/kg bodyweight) 
was assessed with the Good Strength chair test. Linear regression analysis was 
used to test the association between dietary protein intake and muscle strength, 
adjusting for relevant confounders. Data from 1316 subjects (mean age 61.4 ± SD 
9.1 years, 57.0% female) were used. The mean daily protein intake was 0.72 ± SD 
0.30 g/kg bodyweight, and 65.1% of the subjects had a protein intake lower than 
the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg bodyweight. The mean muscle strength 
was 5.4 ± SD 2.1 N/kg bodyweight. Lower protein intake was significantly 
associated with lower muscle strength (B = 0.583, 95% CI 0.230-0.936, 
p = 0.001). The majority of the subjects with knee OA had a dietary protein 
intake lower than the recommended daily allowance. Lower protein intake was 
associated with lower upper leg muscle strength. Longitudinal observational and 
interventional studies are needed to establish whether dietary protein intake 
has a causal effect on muscle strength in subjects with knee OA.

In this study we examined the ontogenic development of the digestive tract of 
Vimba bream (Vimba vimba, Family: Cyprinidae) during the first 60 days of life 
(hatching to 60 days after hatching [DAH]). Samples of developing Vimba bream 
were randomly selected at various stages of development: 1-8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 
30, 40, 50, and 60 DAH. For the histological and histochemical studies on the 
development of the alimentary canal, tissue sections prepared from the sampled 
hatchlings were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff and 
observed under a light microscope. The histological structures of both the mouth 
and esophagus were fully developed at 5 and 7 DAH, respectively. Intestinal 
differentiation was observed at 2 DAH, while mucosal folds appeared on the 
intestinal bulb at 7 DAH. At 5 DAH, with the appearance of goblet cells in the 
epithelium of the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, the larvae showed secretion 
activity in these organs. At 6 DAH, secretion was observed in the intestine; at 
this stage of development, the surface of the gastrointestinal tract was covered 
in a neutral mucous-like layer of polysaccharide. The histological observations 
indicate that the early development of the digestive tract in Vimba vimba 
enables larvae to efficiently ingest and digest exogenous feed very quickly 
after hatching.

OBJECTIVE: Carers of people with cancer provide uncompensated care that is often 
physically, emotionally, and financially demanding, which results in neglect of 
their own health. This study's objective was to conduct an economic evaluation 
following a randomised control trial (RCT) involving a proactive telephone 
outcall intervention aimed at improving health outcomes among carers of cancer 
patients.
METHODS: The trial was a single-blind, multicentre, RCT conducted across four 
Australian health services, comprising three outcalls from trained Cancer 
Council 131120 (Cancer Council telephone and information support services) 
nurses compared with three phone call reminders of the availability of 131120 
services (control group). Outcalls consisted of telephone contacts to the 
caregivers initiated by the Cancer Council nurses. The primary trial outcome was 
reduced carer burden. Health care resource use was measured using a resource use 
questionnaire (RUQ), and costs were presented in 2013 $(AUS). 
Quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) were also used as health outcomes. An 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, with bootstrapping 
used to quantify sampling variability. A $50 000 per QALY-gained 
willingness-to-pay threshold was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Results showed that the total mean QALYs-gained were higher (0.02
