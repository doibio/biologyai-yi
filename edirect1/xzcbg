BACKGROUND: Cost utility or cost effective analysis continues to take center 
stage in the United States for defining and measuring the value of treatments in 
interventional pain management. Appropriate cost utility analysis has been 
performed for caudal epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis, and spinal 
cord stimulation. However, the literature pertaining to lumbar interlaminar 
epidural injections is lacking, specifically in reference to cost utility 
analysis derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a pragmatic 
approach in a practical setting.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost utility of lumbar interlaminar epidural 
injections in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain secondary to 
lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic low back pain.
STUDY DESIGN: Analysis based on 3 previously published randomized trials of 
effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections assessing their role in 
disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic pain.
SETTING: A contemporary, private, specialty referral interventional pain 
management center in the United States.
METHODS: Cost utility of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without 
steroids in managing lumbar disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and 
discogenic or axial low back pain was conducted with data derived from 3 RCTs 
that included a 2-year follow-up, with inclusion of 360 patients. The primary 
outcome was significant improvement defined as at least a 50% in pain reduction 
and disability status. Direct payment data from 2016 was utilized for assessment 
of procedural costs. Overall costs, including drug costs, were determined by 
multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a factor of 1.6 to 
accommodate for indirect payments respectively for disc herniation, spinal 
stenosis, discogenic pain.
RESULTS: The results of 3 RCTs showed direct cost utility for one year of 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of $2,050.87 for disc herniation, $2,112.25 
for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, and $1,773.28 for spinal 
stenosis, with an average cost per one year QALY of $1,976.58, with total 
estimated costs of $3,425, $3,527, $2,961, and $3,301 respectively.
LIMITATIONS: The limitation of this cost utility analysis includes that it is a 
single center evaluation, even though 360 patients were included in this 
analysis. Further, only the costs of interventional procedures and physician 
visits were assessed based on the data, with extrapolation of indirect costs 
presenting the overall total costs. The benefits of returning to work were not 
assessed.
CONCLUSION: This cost utility analysis of lumbar interlaminar epidural 
injections in patients nonresponsive to conservative management in the treatment 
of disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic low back 
pain in the lumbar spine shows the clinical effectiveness and cost utility of 
these injections of $1,976.58 for direct costs with a total cost of $3,301 per 
QALY.

PURPOSE: We present the long-term effects of repeat onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U 
treatment on health related quality of life in patients with overactive bladder 
and urinary incontinence who had an inadequate response to and/or were 
intolerant of an anticholinergic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who completed either of 2, 24-week phase III 
trials could enter a 3-year extension study and request multiple 
onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U treatments as needed. Results of the I-QOL 
(Incontinence-Quality of Life) and KHQ (King's Health Questionnaire) are 
reported for up to 6 treatments. Consistency of the response to repeat 
onabotulinumtoxinA treatments was evaluated by classifying patients by the I-QOL 
response to the first treatment and analyzing responses to treatments 2 to 6.
RESULTS: After onabotulinumtoxinA treatments 1 to 6, improvements in I-QOL 
scores were consistently 2 to 3 times the minimally important difference, and 
improvements in KHQ role limitations and social limitations domain scores were 5 
to 6 and 3 to 4 times the minimally important difference, respectively. Most 
patients achieved or exceeded the minimally important difference for I-QOL and 
KHQ domain scores. Furthermore, 72.9% of patients who achieved or exceeded the 
minimally important difference for I-QOL after treatment 1 did so for all 
subsequent treatments. Of patients with a poor response after treatment 1, 38.3% 
achieved improvements greater than the minimally important difference for all 
subsequent treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with overactive bladder and incontinence consistent and 
clinically meaningful improvements in health related quality of life were 
observed with repeat onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U treatments. A positive response 
after treatment 1 tended to predict similar responses to subsequent treatments, 
whereas a lack of response to treatment 1 did not preclude positive response(s) 
to later treatments.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and its association with reduced life expectancy are well 
established, with cardiovascular disease as one of the major causes of fatality. 
Metabolic surgery is a powerful intervention for severe obesity, resulting in 
improvement in comorbid diseases and in cardiovascular risk factors. This study 
investigates the relationship between metabolic surgery and long-term 
cardiovascular events.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) 
patients was tightly matched by age, body mass index, sex, Framingham Risk 
Score, smoking history, use of antihypertension medication, diabetes mellitus 
status, and calendar year with a concurrent cohort of nonoperated control 
patients. The primary study end points of major cardiovascular events 
(myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure) were evaluated 
using Cox regression. Secondary end points of longitudinal cardiovascular risk 
factors were evaluated using repeated-measures regression. The RYGB and matched 
controls (N=1724 in each cohort) were followed for up to 12 years after surgery 
(overall median of 6.3 years). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a statistically 
significant reduction in incident major composite cardiovascular events 
(P=0.017) and congestive heart failure (0.0077) for the RYGB cohort. Adjusted 
Cox regression models confirmed the reductions in severe composite 
cardiovascular events in the RYGB cohort (hazard ratio=0.58, 95% CI=0.42-0.82). 
Improvements of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, 10-year cardiovascular risk 
score, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, and 
diabetes mellitus) were observed within the RYGB cohort after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric bypass is associated with a reduced risk of major 
cardiovascular events and the development of congestive heart failure.

Comparable taxonomic ranks within clades can facilitate more consistent 
classifications and objective comparisons among taxa. Here we use a temporal 
approach to identify taxonomic ranks. This is an extension of the temporal 
banding approach including a Temporal Error Score that finds an objective 
cut-off for each taxonomic rank using information for the current 
classification. We illustrate this method using a data set of the lichenized 
fungal family Parmeliaceae. To assess its performance, we simulated the effect 
of taxon sampling and compared our method with the other temporal banding 
method. For our sampled phylogeny, 11 of the 12 included families remained 
intact and 55 genera were confirmed, whereas 32 genera were lumped and 15 genera 
were split. Taxon sampling impacted the method at the genus level, whereas 
yielded only insignificant changes at the family level. The other available 
temporal approach also gives a similar cutoff point to our method. Our approach 
to identify taxonomic ranks enables taxonomists to revise and propose 
classifications on an objective basis, changing ranks of clades only when 
inconsistent with most taxa in a phylogenetic tree. An R script to find the time 
point with the minimal temporal error is provided.

A novel treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism: a pilot study on the 
beneficial effects of l-carnitine and selenium.

OBJECTIVE: The definition itself of subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) and, 
therefore, the therapeutic approach to patients with SHyper still remains 
undefined and controversial. Therefore, the interest of finding a novel and 
alternative therapy for SHyper has caught the attention. An observational pilot 
study was performed to assess the effects of l-carnitine and selenium in the 
management of SHyper symptoms and endocrine profile in patients affected by this 
disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with TSH levels between 0.1-0.4 mIU/L and 
positive antibodies were recruited in this study. Subjects received orally one 
tablet containing 500 mg of l-carnitine and 83 mcg of selenium (L-Carn + Se), 
daily for 1 month. The primary outcome was the improvement of the quality of 
life (QoL) with the disappearance of main symptoms (subjective symptomatology) 
associated to SHyper, evaluated through a 9-items short form survey. Secondary 
outcomes included TSH, fT3, and fT4, TPOAb, TgAb measurement. Primary and 
secondary outcomes were evaluated at baseline, after the completion of treatment 
and after a successive month without treatment.
RESULTS: After 1-month treatment, the subjective symptomatology significantly 
dropped from 25.61 ± 1.19 to 12.11 ± 1.15 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, during 
the following 1-month period without treatment, it increased back to 23.33 ± 
1.35 (p < 0.05). Thyroid hormones and auto-antibodies remained in their normal 
range.
CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study has shown that L-Carn + Se significantly 
reduced symptoms associated with SHyper, improving QoL of patients, without 
significant modifications of their endocrine profile. In addition, it is 
noteworthy that the extension of treatment seems necessary to prevent symptoms 
reappearance. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address 
clinicians to define the appropriate treatment-settings for this disorder.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness from the payer perspective of using 
dermatologists versus pediatricians to treat acne in adolescents ages 10-18.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to explore outcomes over a 2-year period 
from the US private payer perspective. Patients ages 10-18 with acne entered the 
model under the "dermatologist"and "pediatrician" conditions. In each 3-month 
cycle,each modeled patient received topical retinoids,benzoyl peroxide (BP), 
antibiotics, or no treatment,and could progress to an acne-free state or remain 
in an acne state.
RESULTS: The average patient spent42.3% of the time in acne-free states under 
the dermatologist condition and 28.0% of the time in acne-free states under the 
pediatrician condition.The cohort of 1000 patients experienced 1900 total 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $2.33 million in the 
dermatologist condition and 1883 total QALYs at a cost of $1.62 million in the 
pediatrician condition, yielding an ICER of $40,000/QALY. Most sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the base case results.
CONCLUSION: Dermatologist treatment appears cost-effective related to producing 
additional QALYs at a cost of less than $100,000 per QALY gained. Health plans 
should consider creating incentives to direct enrollees to dermatologists for 
acne treatment.

BACKGROUND: Dialysis in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
comorbidities may not be associated with improved life expectancy compared to 
conservative management. To inform clinical practice, we performed a systematic 
review of all available studies examining this hypothesis.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of retrospective and prospective 
cohort studies of older adults with stage-5 CKD who chose dialysis (hemodialysis 
or peritoneal dialysis) or opted for conservative management (including 
management of complications of CKD and palliative care). Outcomes of interest 
included hospitalizations and mortality.
RESULTS: Twelve cohort studies (11,515 patients) were identified with most of 
them focusing on older adults. Patients choosing dialysis were younger compared 
to those opting for conservative management and were less functionally impaired. 
Patients opting for conservative management received care in a multidisciplinary 
setting focusing on palliative care and management of complications of CKD. 
Patients choosing dialysis and conservative management had a median survival 
time of 8-67 and 6-30 months, respectively. In a subset of studies of patients 
65 years and older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 
m2, and where the multivariable analyses included age and comorbidities, by 
meta-analysis, patients choosing dialysis had a pooled adjusted hazard ratio for 
mortality of 0.53 (95% CI 0.30-0.91, p = 0.02) relative to those opting for 
conservative management; however, significant heterogeneity precluded definitive 
conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: When caring for older adults with advanced CKD who are 
contemplating dialysis therapy vs. conservative management, efforts must focus 
on promoting patient values and preferences, shared decision-making, and symptom 
burden alleviation.

OBJECTIVE: To report the results from applying a therapeutic relationship to 
people with common mental disorder.
METHOD: Quantitative, descriptive, before and after study, conducted with 112 
records accessed from an extension project in mental health in primary health 
care in Santo André, São Paulo. Screening was performed using a Self-Reporting 
Questionnaire. Data was collected in October 2014 and analyzed using simple 
frequency measures.
RESULTS: The entry score ranged between 7 and18 points, and the higher the 
frequency, the more relationship sessions were necessary. At the end of the 
relationship process, 55% had a negative score and 45% passed the score ≤3.
CONCLUSION: Therapeutic relationship as nursing care in mental health transcends 
the area of specialty. Continuous review and process redirecting led users to 
enlarge their view of the suffering triggers, build coping strategies and 
exercise changes in daily life.

We confirm five-phased construction of Drosophila annuity curves established 
earlier. Annuity curves were composed of stable five-phase component and 
variable one. Variable component was due to differences in phase durations. As 
stable, so variable components were apparent for 60 generations. Stochastic 
component was described as well. Viability variance which characterize «reaction 
norm» was apparent for all generation as well. Thus, both types of variability 
seem to be inherited.

Publisher: Подтверждена реальность установленной ранее двухкомпонентной 
конструкции кривых дожития у Drosophila melanogaster линии Canton-S. Конструкция 
состоит в комбинации стабильной пятифазной структуры с изменчивой длительностью 
фаз (что определяет вариабельность жизнеспособности насекомых). Как стабильная, 
так и изменчивая компонента сохранилась на протяжении 60 поколений мух. 
Указанная необычная форма изменчивости существует наряду с известной ее формой, 
обусловленной стохастическим разбросом кривых дожития. Дисперсия 
жизнеспособности, характеризующая норму реакции, также не изменяется в ряду 
поколений. Таким образом, обе формы изменчивости могут быть отнесены к категории 
наследственно детерминированных явлений.

Persistent social inequality in life expectancy and disability-free life 
expectancy: Outlook for a differential pension age in Denmark?

Copenhagen, Denmark.

and Danish Ageing Research Centre, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark.

AIMS: The state old-age pension in Denmark increases to keep pace with the 
projected increase in average life expectancy (LE) without any regard to the 
social gap in LE and expected lifetime in good health. The purpose of this study 
was to compare changes in LE and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) between 
groups of Danes with high, medium and low levels of education.
METHODS: Nationwide register data on education and mortality were combined with 
data from the Surveys of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) surveys 
in 2006-2007, 2010-2011 and 2013-2014 and the DFLE by educational level was 
estimated by Sullivan's method for each of these three time points.
RESULTS: Between 2006-2007 and 2013-2014, LE among 65-year-old men and women 
with a low educational level increased by 1.3 and 1.0 years, respectively, and 
by 1.4 and 1.3 years for highly educated men and women. The gap in LE between 
people with high and low levels of education remained more than 2 years. In 
2006-2007, 65-year-old men with a high level of education could expect 3.2 more 
years without disability than men of the same age with a low level of education. 
In 2013-2014, the difference was 2.9 years. For women, the results were 3.7 and 
3.4 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: With the persistent social inequality in LE of more than 2 years 
and the continuous gap between high and low educational groups in DFLE of about 
3 years, a differential pension age is recommended.

Case report of treatment experience with idursulfase beta (Hunterase) in an 
adolescent patient with MPS II.

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) II or Hunter syndrome is a chronic, progressive, 
multi-systemic illness associated with significant morbidity and early 
mortality. Available evidence in Asian populations shows that Hunter syndrome 
has a mean age of onset of 2 to 5 years and a life expectancy of 13 years in 
more severely affected individuals, with respiratory failure reported as the 
leading cause of death. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with idursulfase 
(Elaprase, Shire Pharmaceuticals) and idursulfase beta (Hunterase, Green Cross 
Corp) are the only approved treatment for patients with MPS II. While these 
agents have the same amino acids, they have different glycosylation patterns 
because they are produced in different cell lines via different manufacturing 
processes. In previous studies, the beneficial effects of idursulfase beta have 
been confirmed in patients up to 35 years of age, without serious 
treatment-related safety concerns. The major drawbacks associated with ERT 
include the potential development of serious infusion-related anaphylactic 
reactions and up to 50% of treated patients develop anti-IDS antibodies. Here we 
report the case of a 13-year-old Malaysian patient with attenuated MPS II who 
developed troublesome infusion-associated reactions while receiving idursulfase 
treatment but tolerated and responded favorably to idursulfase beta.

Electroactive films based on conducting polymers have numerous potential 
applications, but practical devices frequently require a combination of 
properties not met by a single component. This has prompted an extension to 
composite materials, notably those in which particulates are immobilised within 
a polymer film. Irrespective of the polymer and the intended application, film 
wetting is important: by various means, it facilitates transport processes - of 
electronic charge, charge-balancing counter ions ("dopant") and analyte/reactant 
molecules - and motion of polymer segments. While film solvent content and 
transfer have been widely studied for pristine polymer films exposed to 
molecular solvents, extension to non-conventional solvents (such as ionic 
liquids) or to composite films has been given much less attention. Here we 
consider such cases based on polyaniline films. We explore two factors, the 
nature of the electrolyte (solvent and film-permeating ions) and the effect of 
introducing particulate species into the film. In the first instance, we compare 
film behaviours when exposed to a conventional protic solvent (water) with an 
aprotic ionic liquid (Ethaline) and the intermediate case of a protic ionic 
liquid (Oxaline). Secondly, we explore the effect of inclusion of physically 
diverse particulates: multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphite or molybdenum 
dioxide. We use electrochemistry to control and monitor the film redox state and 
change therein, and acoustic wave measurements to diagnose rheologically vs. 
gravimetrically determined response. The outcomes provide insights of relevance 
to future practical applications, including charge/discharge rates and cycle 
life for energy storage devices, "salt" transfer in water purification 
technologies, and the extent of film "memory" of previous environments when 
sequentially exposed to different media.

AIM: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic eradication 
therapy (EET) with combined endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency 
ablation for the treatment of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) arising in patients 
with Barrett's esophagus compared with endoscopic surveillance alone in the UK.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The cost-effectiveness model consisted of a decision tree 
and modified Markov model. A lifetime time horizon was adopted with the 
perspective of the UK healthcare system.
RESULTS: The base case analysis estimates that EET for the treatment of HGD is 
cost-effective at a GB£20,000 cost-effectiveness threshold compared with 
providing surveillance alone for HGD patients (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio: GB£1272).
CONCLUSION: EET is likely to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared 
with surveillance alone in patients with HGD arising in Barrett's esophagus in 
the UK.

The Mythimna (=Leucania) loreyi (Duponchel) has recently emerged as a major pest 
of grain crops in China. Little is known about its basic biology and ecology, 
making it difficult to predict its population dynamics. An age-stage, two-sex 
life table was constructed for this insect when reared on maize in the 
laboratory at five constant temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 °C). Both the 
intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate increase (λ) increased as 
temperature significantly increased and mean generation time (T) decreased 
significantly with increasing temperature. The highest values for net 
reproductive rate (R0) and fecundity were observed at 24 °C. However, M. loreyi 
was able to develop, survive, and lay eggs at all temperatures tested 
(18-30 °C). Development rates at different temperatures for the egg, larval, 
pupal, as well as for a total preoviposition period, fit a linear equation. The 
lower threshold temperatures of egg, larval, pupal, preoviposition, and total 
preoviposition period were 8.83, 10.95, 11.67, 9.30, and 9.65 °C, respectively. 
And their effective accumulated temperatures were 87.64, 298.51, 208.33, 66.47, 
and 729.93 degree-days, respectively. This study provides insight into the 
temperature-based phenology and population ecology in M. loreyi. The results 
will benefit population dynamics monitoring, prediction, and management of this 
insect pest in the field.

The Association Between Socioeconomic Status and Adult Mortality in a Developing 
Country: Evidence From a Nationally Representative Longitudinal Survey of 
Indonesian Adults.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and 
adult mortality in Indonesia and determine the contribution of adult behavioral 
risk factors to SES differences in mortality.
METHODS: Discrete failure-time regression models and period life tables were 
used to estimate life expectancy at age 30 (e30) across wealth and consumption 
groups by sex and urban/rural residence.
RESULTS: For urban men, e30 increases by an average of 1.10 years per wealth 
quartile (p = .014) from 38.7 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 37.4-40.5) in 
the bottom wealth quartile to 42.1 years (95% CI: 40.3-44.1) in the top 
quartile; for rural men, e30 increases by an average of 1.35 years per quartile 
(p = .007) from 40.6 years (95% CI: 39.2-42.5) in the bottom wealth quartile to 
44.3 years (95% CI: 42.4-46.6) in the top quartile. SES differences are smaller 
for women. Behavioral risk factors are inconsistently patterned across SES and 
do not explain SES differences in mortality.
DISCUSSION: The associations between SES and adult life expectancy in Indonesia 
are moderate when compared with developed countries and are not explained by 
traditional behavioral risk factors. In a context where behavioral risk factors 
are inconsistent across SES groups, mortality inequality may be driven by 
inequalities in health care access or other social factors.

OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is being adapted to gynecologic 
cancer. Higher SLN mapping rates were reported with indocyanine green (ICG) 
compared to other dyes. The aim of this film is to share our experience of SLN 
mapping with ICG in vaginal cancer.
METHODS: A 40 year-old woman was diagnosed with squamous cell vaginal cancer. 
About 1.5 cm-sized tumor was located on the posterior vaginal fornix. 
Preoperatively she was assumed to be stage I vaginal cancer. Beginning of 
surgery, we performed SLN mapping by ICG injection into 3- and 9-o'clock 
positions of the vaginal tumor. Concentrated in 1.25 mg/mL, 1 mL of ICG solution 
was injected into deep stroma and another 1 mL submucosally in both sides. 
Bilateral SLN identification and lymphadenectomy were done. Afterward, 
laparoscopic Type C1 Querleu-Morrow radical hysterectomy with vaginectomy was 
done. A fluorescence endoscope produced by KARL STORZ (Tuttlingen, Germany) was 
used for ICG detection.
RESULTS: To our knowledge, this is the first film report performing SLN mapping 
with ICG in vaginal cancer. The mapping was successful and we were able to 
recognize SLN of vaginal cancer. SLNs were located in the bilateral obturator 
fossa. According to the pathologic diagnosis, the mass size was 15 mm and 
invasion depth was 1 mm. Subvaginal tissue involvement and pelvic wall extension 
were absent. Resection margin of the vagina was free from carcinoma. No lymph 
node metastasis was reported including the bilateral SLNs.
CONCLUSION: For vaginal cancer, SLN mapping can be applied by injecting ICG into 
the bilateral sides of the vaginal tumor.

BACKGROUND: The Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in 
Schools (APPLE Schools) has been recognized as a "best practice" in preventing 
childhood obesity. To inform decision making on the economic implications of 
APPLE Schools and to justify investment, we evaluated the project's 
cost-effectiveness following a life-course approach.
METHODS: We developed a state transition model for the lifetime progression of 
body weight status comparing elementary school students attending APPLE Schools 
and control schools. This model quantified the lifetime impact of APPLE Schools 
in terms of prevention of excess body weight, chronic disease and improved 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), from a school system's cost perspective. 
Both costs and health outcomes were discounted to their present value using 3% 
discount rate.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) of APPLE schools was 
CA$33,421 per QALY gained, and CA$1,555, CA$1,709 and CA$14,218 per prevented 
person years of excess weight, obesity and chronic disease, respectively. These 
estimates show that APPLE Schools is cost effective at a threshold of ICER < 
CA$50,000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APPLE Schools was cost 
effective more than 64% of the time per QALY gained, when using a threshold of 
ICER<CA$50,000, and more than 93% of the time when using a threshold of 
ICER<CA$100,000.
CONCLUSION: School-based health promotion, such as APPLE Schools is a 
cost-effective intervention for obesity prevention and reduction of chronic 
disease risk over the lifetime. Expanding the coverage and allocating resources 
towards school-based programs like the APPLE Schools program, is likely to 
reduce the public health burden of obesity and chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a leading cause 
of morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Although 
antiretroviral drugs have helped to improve the quality of life and life 
expectancy of HIV-positive individuals, there is still a need to explore other 
interventions that will help to further reduce the disease burden. One potential 
strategy is the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in combination with antiretroviral 
therapy (ART). IL-2 is a cytokine that regulates the proliferation and 
differentiation of lymphocytes and may help to boost the immune system.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as an adjunct to 
antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following sources up to 26 May 2016: the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the 
Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Web of Science; LILACS; the World Health 
Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP); and 
ClinicalTrials.gov. We also checked conference abstracts, contacted experts and 
relevant organizations in the field, and checked the reference list of all 
studies identified by the above methods for any other potentially eligible 
studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the 
effects of IL-2 as an adjunct to ART in reducing the morbidity and mortality in 
HIV-positive adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened records 
and selected trials that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and 
assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. Where possible, we compared 
the effects of interventions using risk ratios (RR), and presented them with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence 
using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: Following a comprehensive literature search up to 26 May 2016, we 
identified 25 eligible trials. The interventions involved the use of IL-2 in 
combination with ART compared with ART alone. There was no difference in 
mortality apparent between the IL-2 group and the ART alone group (RR 0.97, 95% 
CI 0.80 to 1.17; 6 trials, 6565 participants, high certainty evidence). 
Seventeen of 21 trials reported an increase in the CD4 cell count with the use 
of IL-2 compared to control using different measures (21 trials, 7600 
participants). Overall, there was little or no difference in the proportion of 
participants with a viral load of less than 50 cells/mL or less than 500 
cells/mL by the end of the trials (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15; 5 trials, 805 
participants, high certainty evidence) and (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 4 
trials, 5929 participants, high certainty evidence) respectively. Overall there 
may be little or no difference in the occurrence of opportunistic infections (RR 
0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; 7 trials, 6141 participants, low certainty evidence). 
There was probably an increase in grade 3 or 4 adverse events (RR 1.47, 95% CI 
1.10 to 1.96; 6 trials, 6291 participants, moderate certainty evidence). None of 
the included trials reported adherence.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high certainty evidence that IL-2 in combination 
with ART increases the CD4 cell count in HIV-positive adults. However, IL-2 does 
not confer any significant benefit in mortality, there is probably no difference 
in the incidence of opportunistic infections, and there is probably an increase 
in grade 3 or 4 adverse effects. Our findings do not support the use of IL-2 as 
an adjunct to ART in HIV-positive adults. Based on our findings, further trials 
are not justified.

Decellularized Human Liver Is Too Heterogeneous for Designing a Generic 
Extracellular Matrix Mimic Hepatic Scaffold.

Decellularized human livers are considered the perfect extracellular matrix 
(ECM) surrogate because both three-dimensional architecture and biological 
features of the hepatic microenvironment are thought to be preserved. However, 
donor human livers are in chronically short supply, both for transplantation or 
as decellularized scaffolds, and will become even scarcer as life expectancy 
increases. It is hence of interest to determine the structural and biochemical 
properties of human hepatic ECM to derive design criteria for engineering 
biomimetic scaffolds. The intention of this work was to obtain quantitative 
design specifications for fabricating scaffolds for hepatic tissue engineering 
using human livers as a template. To this end, hepatic samples from five 
patients scheduled for hepatic resection were decellularized using a protocol 
shown to reproducibly conserve matrix composition and microstructure in porcine 
livers. The decellularization outcome was evaluated through histological and 
quantitative image analyses to evaluate cell removal, protein, and 
glycosaminoglycan content per unit area. Applying the same decellularization 
protocol to human liver samples obtained from five different patients yielded 
five different outcomes. Only one liver out of five was completely 
decellularized, while the other four showed different levels of remaining cells 
and matrix. Moreover, protein and glycosaminoglycan content per unit area after 
decellularization were also found to be patient- (or donor-) dependent. This 
donor-to-donor variability of human livers thus precludes their use as templates 
for engineering a generic "one-size fits all" ECM-mimic hepatic scaffold.

Burnout has been disproportionally reported in child protection social work. 
This paper presents data from 162 child protection staff in Northern Ireland, 
assessed for burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Path models were 
estimated, based on an extension of the two-process demands and values model 
(Leiter, ) to include additional measures of resilience using the Resilience 
Scale-14, as well as perceived rewards and sense of community from the Areas of 
Work Life Scale (Leiter, ). Optimal model fit was achieved by modelling 
resilience as a mediator of the relationship between organizational factors of 
control and value congruence and burnout. Resilience also directly predicted 
emotional exhaustion (β = -.23, p < .005) and personal accomplishment (β = .46, 
p < .001). Workload was the strongest direct predictor of emotional exhaustion 
(β = -.54, p < .001). Adding perceived rewards to extend the two-process model 
resulted in moderate associations with control (β = .44, p < .001), workload 
(β = .26, p < .005), fairness (β = .40, p < .001), and values (β = .32, 
p < .001). In the final model, resilience is modelled as both an outcome of some 
organizational factors whilst also making a unique direct contribution to 
explaining burnout alongside other organizational factors. Other pathways and 
mediating relationships are reported and further research directions discussed.

The purpose of this work was to develop an optimized liposomal formulation of 
topotecan for use in the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. Drug exposure 
time studies were used to determine that topotecan (Hycamtin) exhibited great 
cytotoxic activity against SK-N-SH, IMR-32 and LAN-1 neuroblastoma human cell 
lines. Sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol (Chol) and 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)/Chol liposomes were prepared 
using extrusion methods and then loaded with topotecan by pH gradient and 
copper-drug complexation. In vitro studies showed that SM/Chol liposomes 
retained topotecan significantly better than DSPC/Chol liposomes. Decreasing the 
drug-to-lipid ratio engendered significant increases in drug retention. 
Dose-range finding studies on NRG mice indicated that an optimized SM/Chol 
liposomal formulation of topotecan prepared with a final drug-to-lipid ratio of 
0.025 (mol: mol) was better tolerated than the previously described DSPC/Chol 
topotecan formulation. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the optimized SM/Chol 
liposomal topotecan exhibited a 10-fold increase in plasma half-life and a 
1000-fold increase in AUC0-24 h when compared with Hycamtin administered at 
equivalent doses (5 mg/kg). In contrast to the great extension in exposure time, 
SM/Chol liposomal topotecan increased the life span of mice with established 
LAN-1 neuroblastoma tumors only modestly in a subcutaneous and systemic model. 
The extension in exposure time may still not be sufficient and the formulation 
may require further optimization. In the future, liposomal topotecan will be 
assessed in combination with high-dose radiotherapy such as 131 
I-metaiodobenzylguanidine, and immunotherapy treatment modalities currently used 
in neuroblastoma therapy.

OBJECTIVE: Treat-to-target approaches have proved to be effective in rheumatoid 
arthritis, but have not been studied in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study 
was undertaken to examine the cost-effectiveness of tight control (TC) of 
inflammation in early PsA compared to standard care.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside a UK-based, 
open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Taking the perspective of 
the health care sector, effectiveness was measured using the 3-level EuroQol 
5-domain, which allows for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are presented, which 
represent the additional cost per QALY gained over a 48-week time horizon. 
Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of variations in the 
analytical approach and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness estimates.
RESULTS: The mean cost and QALYs were higher in the TC group: £4,198 versus
