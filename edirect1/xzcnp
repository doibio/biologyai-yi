This review states the reasons for considering screening for intracranial 
aneurysms in Denmark: if patients have two first-degree relatives with 
intracranial aneurysms, are 30-70 years old, do not have competing disorders, 
which could significantly shorten life expectancy, and subsequently in patients 
with autosomal dominant kidney disease and a family history of subarachnoid 
haemorrhage. MR angiography should be the imaging study of choice, unless 
contraindicated. Generally, the ethical consequences ought to be considered 
before carrying out screening.

Cognitive aging has become a major concern because life expectancy has increased 
and elderly populations are socially and economically active. Neurofeedback is a 
technique of neuromodulation through operant conditioning paradigm that uses a 
computer interface to provide real-time information about brain activity to 
increase individual self-perception and assist in modulation. The sensorimotor 
rhythm (SMR) training protocol is known to enhance attention and has been 
applied to improve cognitive performance, primarily for attention and memory 
gains. The aim of this study is to test if the SMR protocol can improve working 
memory performance in an aging population and consequently favor cognitive 
reserve. Seventeen older adults (12 females) took part in a randomized 
placebo-controlled study. They completed a visual working memory test, Delayed 
Matching to Sample Task (DMTS), before and after the SMR neurofeedback protocol 
in order to compare their visual working memory performance. Moreover, a 
19-channels EEG was collected while they perform the DMTS pre- and 
post-training. The experimental group showed an improvement in their working 
memory performance after the training with similar activation power, mainly in 
theta and beta frequency band at frontal and alpha at temporal regions. The sham 
group showed some variations in the score of working memory after the training, 
but were not statistically significant and their power spectrum demonstrate 
enhancement in alpha and beta band frontal and temporal. The group that did not 
receive neurofeedback training did not show a change in their working memory 
performance, neither in their EEG spectrum. The results suggest that 
neurofeedback can benefit brain reserve in an aging population because 
individuals enhanced their working memory performance after training and have 
their EEG activation changed according to expected in working memory tasks.

Introduction: Young people with psychosis are six times more likely to be 
tobacco smokers than their gender- and age-matched peers. Smoking is a major 
contributor to the 15-year reduced life expectancy among people experiencing 
severe mental illness (SMI). There is a lack of evidence-supported interventions 
for smoking cessation among young people with SMI. Material and Methods: The 
study comprised two phases and aimed to assess (i) the prevalence of smoking 
among a community sample of young people with psychotic illness or at high risk 
of developing psychosis; (ii) the proportion who engaged in the intervention; 
(iii) the proportion who achieved smoking cessation; and (iv) secondary 
smoking-related outcomes. In phase one, prevalence of smoking was assessed among 
young people with psychotic illness or at high risk of developing psychosis 
attending a community-based youth mental health service between 16/5/2017 and 
16/11/2017. In phase two, over a 1-year period, individuals identified as 
smokers were invited to participate in a 12-week tailored smoking cessation 
intervention program that included pharmacological treatment, motivational 
interviewing, and behavioral change techniques. Those unwilling to participate 
in a full intervention were offered a brief intervention. Participants of the 
full intervention were assessed at baseline and at week 12 endpoint on: daily 
cigarettes smoked (self-report), exhaled CO, nicotine dependence, readiness to 
quit, and confidence to quit. Results: In phase one, smoking prevalence was 
48.2% (53 of 110) among clients of the youth mental health service. Smokers were 
significantly more likely to be male (X 2 = 6.41 p = 0.009). During phase two, 
41 of 61 eligible clients engaged in a smoking cessation intervention (67.2%). 
Effectiveness: twenty-one clients participated in a full intervention (34.4%), 
of whom three (14.3%) received a brief intervention initially and during 
engagement converted to full intervention. Twenty participants (32.8%) received 
a brief intervention only. Ten participants in the full intervention (47.6%) and 
five in the brief intervention (25%) dropped out. Six (28.6% of full 
intervention) reported smoking cessation verified by CO monitoring. Participants 
who completed the full intervention (n = 9) reduced number of cigarettes smoked, 
nicotine dependence, and exhaled CO, while readiness to quit and confidence to 
quit increased. Pharmacotherapy was predominantly combination NRT (n = 18; 
85.7%), varenicline (4.8%), oral NRT only (4.8%), or none (4.8%). No adverse 
events were reported. Conclusion: This pilot real-world study demonstrates that 
both screening for smoking and offering an effective smoking cessation 
intervention are achievable in youth experiencing or at risk of psychosis.

Introduction: Antipsychotic medication (APM) initiation is associated with rapid 
and substantial weight-gain and high rates of obesity. Obesity leads to 
premature onset of cardiometabolic diseases and contributes to the 15-20 year 
shortfall in life expectancy in those experiencing severe mental illness. 
Dietary energy intake excess is critical to weight management but is yet to be 
quantified in youth with first episode psychosis (FEP) receiving APM. This study 
aimed to describe the degree of energy overconsumption and the food sources 
contributing to this in youth with FEP. Materials and Methods: People aged 15-30 
years with FEP receiving APM completed diet histories through qualified 
dietitians to assess energy imbalance and food sources. Outcome measures were: 
(i) energy balance; and (ii) intake of core and discretionary foods. Results: 
Participants (n = 93) were aged 15-29 years (mean = 21.4 ± 2.9 years) and 
exposed to APMs for a median for 8 months (Interquartile Range (IQR) 11 months). 
Energy balance was exceeded by 26%, by a median 1,837 kJ per day (IQR 5,365 kJ). 
APM polypharmacy and olanzapine were linked to larger excesses in dietary energy 
intake. The greatest contributors to energy intake were refined grain foods 
(33%) and discretionary foods (31%). Conclusion: Young people with FEP receiving 
APMs appear to have markedly excessive energy consumption, likely contributing 
to rapid weight-gain, and thereby seeding future poor physical health. Larger, 
prospective studies are needed to gain a greater understanding of dietary 
intake, and its effects on health, in people with FEP.

Network Representation of T-Cell Repertoire- A Novel Tool to Analyze Immune 
Response to Cancer Formation.

The T cell repertoire potentially presents complexity compatible, or greater 
than, that of the human brain. T cell based immune response is involved with 
practically every part of human physiology, and high-throughput biology needed 
to follow the T-cell repertoire has made great leaps with the advent of massive 
parallel sequencing [1]. Nevertheless, tools to handle and observe the dynamics 
of this complexity have only recently started to emerge [e.g., 2, 3, 4] in 
parallel with sequencing technologies. Here, we present a network-based view of 
the dynamics of the T cell repertoire, during the course of mammary tumors 
development in a mouse model. The transition from the T cell receptor as a 
feature, to network-based clustering, followed by network-based temporal 
analyses, provides novel insights to the workings of the system and provides 
novel tools to observe cancer progression via the perspective of the immune 
system. The crux of the approach here is at the network-motivated clustering. 
The purpose of the clustering step is not merely data reduction and exposing 
structures, but rather to detect hubs, or attractors, within the T cell receptor 
repertoire that might shed light on the behavior of the immune system as a 
dynamic network. The Clone-Attractor is in fact an extension of the clone 
concept, i.e., instead of looking at particular clones we observe the extended 
clonal network by assigning clusters to graph nodes and edges to adjacent 
clusters (editing distance metric). Viewing the system as dynamical brings to 
the fore the notion of an attractors landscape, hence the possibility to chart 
this space and map the sample state at a given time to a vector in this large 
space. Based on this representation we applied two different methods to 
demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying changes in the repertoire that 
correlate with changes in the phenotype: (1) network analysis of the TCR 
repertoire in which two measures were calculated and demonstrated the ability to 
differentiate control from transgenic samples, and, (2) machine learning 
classifier capable of both stratifying control and trangenic samples, as well as 
to stratify pre-cancer and cancer samples.

Frailty and sarcopenia have recently gained considerable attention in terms of 
preventive care in Japan, which has an ever-increasing aging population. 
Sarcopenia is defined as atrophy of skeletal muscles caused by the age-related 
decrease in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones. The 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reports that frailty can lead to 
impairment of both mental and physical functioning. Chronic diseases such as 
diabetes and dementia may underlie frailty. It is important to prevent 
progression of frailty and extend the healthy lifespan. In herbal medicine 
practice, including Japanese Kampo medicine, "Mibyo," a presymptomatic state, 
has long been recognized and may be applicable to frailty. Kampo medicines may 
include several medicinal plants and are thought to have the potential to 
improve symptoms of frailty, such as loss of appetite and body weight, fatigue, 
and sarcopenia, as well as anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. 
Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) is the most powerful Kampo medicine and 
has been widely applied to palliative care of cancer patients. This review 
includes recent anti-aging studies and describes the effects and mechanisms of 
Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) when used for frailty or to extend a 
healthy life expectancy.

HIV Proteins and Endothelial Dysfunction: Implications in Cardiovascular 
Disease.

With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a dramatic decrease in viral 
burden and opportunistic infections and an increase in life expectancy has been 
observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. However, it 
is now clear that HIV- infected individuals have enhanced susceptibility to 
non-AIDS (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)-related complications such as 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVDs such as atherosclerosis have become a 
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with HIV infection. 
Though studies indicate that ART itself may increase the risk to develop CVD, 
recent studies suggest a more important role for HIV infection in contributing 
to CVD independently of the traditional risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction 
triggered by HIV infection has been identified as a critical link between 
infection, inflammation/immune activation, and atherosclerosis. Considering the 
inability of HIV to actively replicate in endothelial cells, endothelial 
dysfunction depends on both HIV-encoded proteins as well as inflammatory 
mediators released in the microenvironment by HIV-infected cells. Indeed, the 
HIV proteins, gp120 (envelope glycoprotein) and Tat (transactivator of 
transcription), are actively secreted into the endothelial cell 
micro-environment during HIV infection, while Nef can be actively transferred 
onto endothelial cells during HIV infection. These proteins can have significant 
direct effects on the endothelium. These include a range of responses that 
contribute to endothelial dysfunction, including enhanced adhesiveness, 
permeability, cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress as well as 
activation of cytokine secretion. This review summarizes the current 
understanding of the interactions of HIV, specifically its proteins with 
endothelial cells and its implications in cardiovascular disease. We analyze 
recent in vitro and in vivo studies examining endothelial dysfunction in 
response to HIV proteins. Furthermore, we discuss the multiple mechanisms by 
which these viral proteins damage the vascular endothelium in HIV patients. A 
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV protein associated 
endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disease is likely to be 
pivotal in devising new strategies to treat and prevent cardiovascular disease 
in HIV-infected patients.

PURPOSE: To report a case of locally recurrent spindle-cell iris amelanotic 
melanoma 16 years after proton-beam therapy.
OBSERVATIONS: In 2001, a 45-year-old man presented with an amelanotic iris 
melanoma, extending from the 5 to 10 o'clock positions on his left eye. 
High-frequency ultrasonography showed extension of melanoma into the ciliary 
body. He was initially managed with proton-beam therapy (60 Gy delivered in four 
fractions over four consecutive days) and underwent ocular and systemic 
examination at regular intervals over the following years. Local tumor control 
was achieved, and the patient did not develop metastasis during sixteen 
consecutive years. In 2017, 16 years after he received proton-beam therapy, the 
patient developed a focal amelanotic lesion strongly suggestive of a local 
recurrence of iris melanoma, although it extended from the 1 to 6 o'clock 
positions. He also presented with treatment-resistant glaucoma with an 
intraocular pressure (IOP) of 37 mmHg, despite maximal topical IOP-lowering 
therapy. Since a second irradiation of the anterior segment was contraindicated, 
the eye was enucleated. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of iris 
melanoma and demonstrated iridocorneal angle invasion extending from the initial 
site to the recurrent tumor location.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Regular ophthalmological surveillance for life with 
gonioscopy and high-frequency ultrasonography is recommended in patients with 
iris melanoma, due to the possibility of delayed local recurrence more than a 
decade after the initial treatment.

AIMS: Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome with significant social and 
economic burden. We aimed to estimate the burden of HF in mainland Portugal over 
a 22-year time horizon, between 2014 and 2036.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Heart failure burden was measured in disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), resulting from the sum of years of life lost (YLL) due to 
premature death and years lost due to disability (YLD). YLL were estimated based 
on the Portuguese mortality rates reported by the European Detailed Mortality 
Database. For YLD, disease duration and the overall incidence were estimated 
using an epidemiological model developed by the World Health Organization 
(DISMOD II). Disability weights were retrieved from published literature. The 
impact of ageing was estimated with a shift-share analysis using official 
demographic projections. In 2014, 4688 deaths were attributed to HF, 
corresponding to 4.7% of the total deaths in mainland Portugal. DALYs totalled 
21 162, 53.9% due to premature death (YLL: 11 398) and 46.1% due to disability 
(YLD: 9765). Considering only population ageing over a 22-year horizon, the 
deaths and burden of HF are expected to increase by 73.0% and 27.9%, 
respectively, reaching 8112 deaths and 27 059 DALYs lost due to HF in 2036. 
DALY's growth is mainly driven by the increase of YLL, whose contribution to 
overall burden will increase to 62.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure is an emerging and growing health problem where 
significant health gains may be obtained. The projected significant increase of 
HF burden highlights the need to set HF as a priority for healthcare system.

PURPOSE: For patients treated with palliative radiation, we examined the 
association between life expectancy predictions by radiation oncologists and 
aggressive end-of-life care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included decedents from a study that assessed the 
ability of oncologists to predict survival of patients with metastatic cancer 
who received radiation. We identified patients who died within 12 months of 
study enrollment to assess accuracy of predictions. Aggressive end-of-life care 
was defined by the National Quality Forum, ASCO Quality Oncology Practice 
Initiative metrics, and advanced radiation modalities in the last month of life. 
Survival predictions were categorized as follows: correct (< 12 months), 12 to 
18 months, 18 to 24 months, and more than 24 months. We assessed association 
between prediction and aggressive end-of-life care using a generalized 
estimation equation.
RESULTS: Of 489 decedents, we identified 467 encounters with survival estimates. 
Overall, 156 decedents (32%) met at least one metric of aggressive end-of-life 
care. Factors associated with aggressive end-of-life care included younger age, 
female sex, primary cancer diagnosis, no brain metastases, and private 
insurance. In each encounter when an oncologist predicted survival, 363 
predictions (78%) were correct (< 12 months), 54 (11%) incorrectly predicted 12 
to 18 months, 27 (6%) predicted 18 to 24 months, and 23 (5%) predicted more than 
24 months. Compared with patients who had encounters that had correct survival 
predictions, patients predicted to live more than 24 months were more likely to 
meet at least one metric of aggressive end-of-life care (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% 
CI, 1.09 to 5.99; P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Inaccurate survival predictions by oncologists are associated with 
more aggressive end-of-life care for patients with advanced cancer.

Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with 
cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to 
frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with 
cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the 
anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous 
thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients 
with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities 
such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, 
cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life 
expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant 
treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail 
patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from 
a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the 
specificities of the malignant disease.

Tubulin is a heterodimer of α and β subunits, both existing as isotypes 
differing in amino acid sequence encoded by different genes. Specific isotypes 
of tubulin have associations with cancer that are not well understood. Previous 
studies found that βII-tubulin is expressed in a number of transformed cells and 
that this isotype is found in cell nuclei in non-microtubule form. The 
association of βII expression and its nuclear localization with cancer 
progression has not previously been addressed. We here used a monoclonal 
antibody to βII to examine patients with colorectal cancer and found that 
patients whose tumors over-express βII have a greatly decreased life expectancy 
which is even shorter in those patients with nuclear βII. Our results suggest 
that βII-tubulin may facilitate cancer growth and metastasis and, to accomplish 
this, may not need to be in microtubule form. Furthermore, βII expression and 
localization could be a useful prognostic marker. We also found that βII appears 
in the nuclei of otherwise normal cells adjacent to the tumor. It is possible 
therefore that cancer cells expressing βII influence nearby cells to do the same 
and to localize βII in their nuclei by an as yet uncharacterized regulatory 
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has been identified as a contributor to obesity. We have 
shown that a diet intervention postpartum produced a 2-y weight loss of 8%. 
Here, we present the impact of the diet intervention on cost-effectiveness and 
explore changes in quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: A total of 110 postpartum women with overweight/obesity were randomly 
assigned to diet (D-group) or control (C-group). D-group received a 12-wk diet 
intervention within primary health care followed by monthly emails up to the 1-y 
follow-up. C-group received a brochure. Changes in QOL were measured using the 
36-item Short Form Health Survey and EQ-5D. The analysis of cost-effectiveness 
was a cost-utility analysis with a health care perspective and included costs of 
intervention for stakeholder, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and 
savings in health care. The likelihood of cost-effectiveness was examined using 
the net monetary benefit method.
RESULTS: The D-group increased their QOL more than the C-group at 12 wk. and 1 
y, with pronounced differences for the dimensions general health and mental 
health, and the mental component summary score (all p < 0.05). Cost per gained 
QALY was 1704-7889 USD. The likelihood for cost-effectiveness, based on a 
willingness to pay 50,000 USD per QALY, was 0.77-1.00.
CONCLUSIONS: A diet intervention that produced clinically relevant postpartum 
weight loss also resulted in increased QOL and was cost-effective.

With the advent and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the 
epidemiology of cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF) associated with HIV 
infection is changing. Near-normal life expectancy in contemporary HIV-infected 
populations has been associated with prolonged exposure to increased 
cardiometabolic burden and chronic immune activation and systemic inflammation. 
Therefore, the pre-ART phenotype of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy with overt 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction and poor prognosis has been replaced over 
time by cardiomyopathy with a more insidious course, more frequent ischemic 
background, and highly prevalent left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 
Patients with HIV are more prone to development of coronary artery disease and 
development of HF after myocardial infarction. The role of ongoing immune 
activation and systemic inflammation, despite highly active ART (HAART), appears 
to be central in this process. The role of HAART toxicity is controversial, as 
HAART itself appears to be protective for the development of HF, but recent data 
suggest that protease inhibitors might adversely affect the course of 
HIV-associated HF. Because of these unique features, the optimal therapeutic 
approach for HIV-associated cardiomyopathy remains unknown. The current 
therapeutic approaches are an extrapolation from noninfected populations. 
Importantly, the significance of the highly prevalent diastolic abnormalities 
among HIV-infected patients is not known. Therefore, further research is needed 
to identify its prognostic implications. Considering the prevalence of 
structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in HIV-infected persons and the 
lack of evidence on how to best screen and treat these patients, systematic 
research on this topic is a public health priority.

The extension of the amyloid hypothesis to include non-protein metabolite 
assemblies invokes a paradigm for the pathology of inborn error of metabolism 
disorders. However, a direct demonstration of the assembly of metabolite 
amyloid-like structures has so far been provided only in vitro. Here, we 
established an in vivo model of adenine self-assembly in yeast, in which 
toxicity is associated with intracellular accumulation of the metabolite. Using 
a strain blocked in the enzymatic pathway downstream to adenine, we observed a 
non-linear dose-dependent growth inhibition. Both the staining with an 
indicative amyloid dye and anti-adenine assemblies antibodies demonstrated the 
accumulation of adenine amyloid-like structures, which were eliminated by 
lowering the supplied adenine levels. Treatment with a polyphenol inhibitor 
reduced the occurrence of amyloid-like structures while not affecting the 
dramatic increase in intracellular adenine concentration, resulting in 
inhibition of cytotoxicity, further supporting the notion that toxicity is 
triggered by adenine assemblies.

Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 
about 1%. People with schizophrenia have a 4-fold higher prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome than the general population, mainly because of antipsychotic treatment 
but perhaps also because of decreased physical activity. Metabolic syndrome is a 
risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the risk of these diseases is 2- to 
3-fold higher in schizophrenia patients than in the general population. The 
suicide risk is also higher in schizophrenia, partly as a result of depression, 
positive, and cognitive symptoms of the disease. The higher suicide rate and 
higher rate of cardiac mortality, a consequence of the increased prevalance of 
cardiovascular diseases, contribute to the reduced life expectancy, which is up 
to 20 years lower than in the general population. Regular physical activity, 
especially in combination with psychosocial and dietary interventions, can 
improve parameters of the metabolic syndrome and cardiorespiratory fitness. 
Furthermore, aerobic exercise has been shown to improve cognitive deficits; 
total symptom severity, including positive and negative symptoms; depression; 
quality of life; and global functioning. High-intensity interval endurance 
training is a feasible and effective way to improve cardiorespiratory fitness 
and metabolic parameters and has been established as such in somatic disorders. 
It may have more beneficial effects on the metabolic state than more moderate 
and continuous endurance training methods, but to date it has not been 
investigated in schizophrenia patients in controlled, randomized trials. This 
review discusses physical training methods to improve cardiorespiratory fitness 
and reduce metabolic syndrome risk factors and symptoms in schizophrenia 
patients. The results of studies and future high-quality clinical trials are 
expected to lead to the development of an evidence-based physical training 
program for patients that includes practical recommendations, such as the 
optimal length and type of aerobic exercise programs and the ideal combination 
of exercise, psychoeducation, and individual weight management sessions.

BACKGROUND: HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a major public health 
problem and a development predicament that affects all sectors, drastically 
affecting the health, economic, and reducing social life expectancy, deepening 
poverty, and contributing to and exacerbating food shortages. Strict adherence 
to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is essential to obtain the desired 
benefit and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance and clinical failure; 
therefore, this study is aimed to assess the antiretroviral (ARV) adherence 
among the HIV patients and suggesting them by possible ways for improving the 
adherence.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Batu Hospital, Batu town. The 
sample size was found to be 160, and systemic random sampling was used to 
collect data by providing a pretested structured questionnaire. The qualitative 
data were analyzed to identify the significance of the relationship between the 
dependent and independent variables.
RESULTS: A total of 160 patients was agreed to involve in our survey, 85.6% of 
patients were adherent by self-report. The main reason of nonadherence cited by 
the patients were; being away from home for some social reasons (33.4%), being 
too busy with other things (25.0%), simply forgot to take their ART (25.0%), 
developed toxicity or side effects (8.3%), having problems for fear of stigma 
and disclosure (8.3%), and (7.5%) of participants also shortage of ARV 
medications at hand because of some public holidays or weekends that coincide 
with date of appointments.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The self-report adherence rate was higher than 
that seen in developing countries. Programs and clinical efforts to improve 
medication taking in the study setups should strive to provide the regular 
follow-up for patients, increase patients' awareness of the side effects of ARVs 
and possible remedies, integrate medications better into patients' daily 
routines, improve patients' confidence, trust, and satisfaction with their 
caregivers, and teach patients to use memory aids.

BACKGROUND: Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with 
atrial fibrillation during initiation and interruption of warfarin. Guidelines 
recommend bridging patients at high risk of stroke, while a recent randomized 
trial demonstrated overall harm in a population at comparatively low risk of 
ischemic stroke. Theory suggests that patients at high risk of stroke and low 
risk of hemorrhage may benefit from bridging, but data informing patient 
selection are scant.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the utility and cost-effectiveness of bridging 
anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, stratified 
by thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with 
lifelong time horizon, from the perspective of a third-party payer MAIN 
MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per bridged patient; US dollars 
per QALY gained KEY RESULTS: Unselected patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation may be harmed by bridging anticoagulation. Hospital admission for 
bridging is almost never cost-effective, and generally harmful. Among patients 
carefully selected by both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, outpatient 
bridging can be beneficial and cost-effective. Results were sensitive to how 
effectively heparin products reduce stroke risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient bridging anticoagulation can be beneficial and 
cost-effective for a subset of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
during interruption or initiation of warfarin. Admission for bridging should be 
avoided.

We describe analyses to estimate the global burden of disease associated with 
methylmercury (MeHg). An intelligence quotient < 70, indicating intellectual 
disability (ID), was selected as the critical disease, maternal hair Hg 
concentration during pregnancy selected as the critical exposure biomarker, and 
a dose-effect relationship of an 0.18 point IQ reduction per µg/g increase in 
maternal hair Hg was assumed, based on a meta-analysis. A systematic review was 
conducted to obtain country-specific data on the distribution of maternal hair 
Hg concentrations. The country-specific incidence of MeHg-associated ID was 
calculated, and a random effects model was used to impute the incidence for 
countries for which no exposure data could be found. The global burden of 
MeHg-associated ID was quantified in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs) using the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Estimates 
methodology, and presented by 14 subregions. In 2015, the global total for 
MeHg-associated cases of ID was 226,655; 210,074 of these cases (93%) were mild 
cases of ID. The highest rate of ID (6 cases per 100,000 population) was found 
in the Americas D subregion. The global DALY estimate was 1,963,869. The Western 
Pacific B subregion contributed the most to this total (696,417), although the 
Americas D subregion had the greatest rate (54 DALYs per 100,000 population). 
The burden of disease associated with MeHg is therefore highly 
subregion-dependent even in areas that are geographically related. The priority 
given to reducing this burden can therefore be expected to vary considerably by 
subregion depending on other health needs.

Deutetrabenazine in the treatment of Huntington's disease.

Richard A(1), Frank S(1).

Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

Deutetrabenazine (DTBZ) is a US FDA-approved treatment for chorea in 
Huntington's disease. The substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at specific 
positions imparts a longer half-life on DTBZ, allowing for less-frequent daily 
dosing. As a reversible vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2 inhibitor, DTBZ 
depletes monoamines at presynaptic nerve terminals. DTBZ significantly improved 
chorea in Huntington's disease patients compared with placebo. This effect 
continued in an ongoing open-label extension study in the cohort who switched 
from tetrabenazine to DTBZ. Whereas there are currently no head-to-head studies 
to adequately compare safety profiles between tetrabenazine and DTBZ, an 
indirect comparison study suggested that the tolerability profile of DTBZ was 
similar to placebo. In fact, there are currently no direct comparisons between 
vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2 inhibitors in humans. This review will 
explore DTBZ's pharmacological properties, drug interactions, administration and 
efficacy.
