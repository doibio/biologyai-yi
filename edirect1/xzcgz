An experimental design is proposed for high-throughput testing of combined 
interventions that might increase life expectancy in rodents. There is a growing 
backlog of promising treatments that have never been tested in mammals, and 
known treatments have not been tested in combination. The dose-response curve is 
often nonlinear, as are the interactions among different therapies. Herein are 
proposed two experimental designs optimized for detecting high-value 
combinations. In Part I, numerical simulation is used to explore a protocol for 
testing different dosages of a single intervention. With reasonable and general 
biological assumptions about the dose-response curve, information is maximized 
when each animal receives a different dosage. In Part II, numerical simulation 
is used to explore a protocol for testing interactions among many combinations 
of treatments, once their individual dosages have been established. Combinations 
of three are identified as a sweet spot for statistics. To conserve resources, 
the protocol is designed to identify those outliers that lead to life extension 
greater than 50%, but not to offer detailed survival curves for any treatments. 
Every combination of three treatments from a universe of 15 total treatments is 
represented, with just three mice replicating each combination. Stepwise 
regression is used to infer information about the effects of individual 
treatments and all their pairwise interactions. Results are not quite as robust 
as for the dosage protocol in Part I, but if there is a combination that extends 
lifespan by more than 50%, it will be detected with 80% certainty. These two 
screening protocols offer the possibility of expediting the identification of 
treatment combinations that are most likely to have the largest effect, while 
controlling costs overall.

OBJECTIVE: For patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 
substantial emphasis has been placed on diagnostic tests that can discern which 
of two treatment options - primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreductive surgery (NACT+ICS) - optimizes 
patient-level outcomes. Our goal was to project potential life expectancy (LE) 
gains that could be achieved by use of such a test.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to project LE for patients with 
stage IIIC EOC. We compared: a "standard-of-care" strategy, in which patients 
were triaged to PCS vs. NACT+ICS based on current clinical practice; and a 
"test" strategy, in which patients were triaged based on results of a 
hypothetical test. We identified those test performance characteristics for 
which the test strategy outperformed the standard-of-care strategy, from a LE 
standpoint. Effects of parameter uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Even with a perfect test, the LE gain was modest (LE with test vs. 
standard-of-care strategy=67.6 vs. 66.4months; LE gain=1.2months). In order to 
outperform the standard-of-care, the test had to have a high probability of 
correctly identifying "resectable" patients at PCS (i.e. those for whom complete 
or optimal cytoreduction would be possible); this test property was more 
important than correct triage of unresectable patients to NACT+ICS. Results were 
sensitive to the proportion of patients whose underlying disease was resectable 
at PCS.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostic tests that are designed to triage patients with advanced 
stage EOC will likely have only a modest effect on LE.

BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common indication for cardiac 
valve surgery; untreated AS is linked to high mortality. The etiological 
background of AS is unknown. Previous human studies were typically based on 
case-control studies. Biomarkers identified in prospective studies could lead to 
novel mechanistic insights.
METHODS: Within a large population survey with blood samples obtained at 
baseline, 334 patients were identified who later underwent surgery for AS 
(median age [interquartile range], 59.9 [10.4] years at survey and 68.3 [12.7] 
at surgery; 48% female). For each case, 2 matched referents were allocated. 
Plasma was analyzed with the multiplex proximity extension assay for screening 
of 92 cardiovascular candidate proteins. Conditional logistic regression models 
were used to assess associations between each protein and AS, with correction 
for multiple testing. A separate set of 106 additional cases with 212 matched 
referents was used in a validation study.
RESULTS: Six proteins (growth differentiation factor 15, galectin-4, von 
Willebrand factor, interleukin 17 receptor A, transferrin receptor protein 1, 
and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) were associated with case 
status in the discovery cohort; odds ratios ranged from 1.25 to 1.37 per SD 
increase in the protein signal. Adjusting the multivariable models for classical 
cardiovascular risk factors at baseline yielded similar results. Subanalyses of 
case-referent triplets (n=133) who showed no visible coronary artery disease at 
the time of surgery in the index person supported associations between AS and 
growth differentiation factor 15 (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 
1.10-1.78) and galectin-4 (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 
1.02-1.59), but these associations were attenuated after excluding individuals 
who donated blood samples within 5 years before surgery. In triplets (n=201), 
which included index individuals with concurrent coronary artery disease at the 
time of surgery, all 6 proteins were robustly associated with case status in all 
sensitivity analyses. In the validation study, the association of all but 1 
(interleukin 17 receptor A) of these proteins were replicated in patients with 
AS with concurrent coronary artery disease but not in patients with AS without 
coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that 5 proteins were altered years before AS 
surgery and that the associations seem to be driven by concurrent 
atherosclerotic disease.

Digital Twins in Health Care: Ethical Implications of an Emerging Engineering 
Paradigm.

Personalized medicine uses fine grained information on individual persons, to 
pinpoint deviations from the normal. 'Digital Twins' in engineering provide a 
conceptual framework to analyze these emerging data-driven health care 
practices, as well as their conceptual and ethical implications for therapy, 
preventative care and human enhancement. Digital Twins stand for a specific 
engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with 
digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When 
applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in 
silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular 
status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as 
the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical 
and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the 
concept of 'normality' or 'health,' as a set of patterns that are regular for a 
particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the 
population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and 
what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the 'asymptomatic 
ill' and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the 
consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. 
Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the 
meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications 
of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to 
health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal 
benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective 
equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for 
inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible 
technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a 
population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This 
duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including 
measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data 
privacy.

BACKGROUND: The recently completed ALEX trial demonstrated that alectinib 
improved progression-free survival, and delayed time to central nervous system 
progression compared with crizotinib in patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. However, the long-term clinical and 
economic impact of using alectinib vs. crizotinib has not been evaluated. The 
objective of this study was to determine the potential cost utility of alectinib 
vs. crizotinib from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed using partition survival methods and 
three health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. ALEX trial 
data informed the progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs 
included drug treatments and supportive care (central nervous system and 
non-central nervous system). Utility values were obtained from trial data and 
literature. Sensitivity analyses included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Treatment with alectinib vs. crizotinib resulted in a gain of 0.91 
life-years, 0.87 quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental costs of 
US$34,151, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
US$39,312/quality-adjusted life-year. Drug costs and utilities in the 
progression-free health state were the main drivers of the model in the one-way 
sensitivity analysis. From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, alectinib had 
a 64% probability of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
US$100,000/quality adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Alectinib increased time in the progression-free state and 
quality-adjusted life-years vs. crizotinib. The marginal cost increase was 
reflective of longer treatment durations in the progression-free state. Central 
nervous system-related costs were considerably lower with alectinib. Our results 
suggest that compared with crizotinib, alectinib may be a cost-effective therapy 
for treatment-naïve patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive 
non-small-cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: We compared efficacy and safety of paclitaxel/capecitabine therapy 
followed by capecitabine for maintenance (PACX) versus cisplatin/capecitabine 
therapy (XP) in advanced gastric cancer.
METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, phase III trial was conducted in China 
(December 2009-February 2014). Adults (n = 320) with histologically confirmed, 
untreated metastatic/unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma; with ≥ 1 measureable lesions according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 criteria; Karnofsky performance score ≥ 70 and life 
expectancy ≥ 3 months were randomized (1:1) to PACX or XP. PACX group received 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenous on days 1 and 8; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally 
BD on days 1-14, followed by a 7-day rest interval for 4 cycles, followed by 
maintenance capecitabine at same dosage/schedule until disease progression, 
unendurable adverse events or death. XP group received cisplatin intravenous 
80 mg/m2 on day 1 and capecitabine at same dosage/schedule as PACX group per 
cycle for 6 cycles.
RESULTS: Median progression-free survival (5.0 versus 5.3 months; hazard ratio 
[95% CI]: 0.906; 0.706-1.164; p = 0.44) and overall survival (12.5 versus 
11.8 months; hazard ratio: 0.878 [0.685-1.125]; p = 0.30) were not significantly 
different between PACX and XP groups. Objective response rate was significantly 
higher (43.1 versus 28.8%; p = 0.012) and disease control rate was similar (77.5 
versus 72.5%; p = 0.75) in PACX versus XP, respectively. Quality of life was 
significantly improved in PACX versus XP after three treatment cycles. Many 
treatment-related adverse events were significantly lesser in PACX than XP.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line chemotherapy with PACX is effective with milder 
toxicities in advanced gastric cancer, but could not replace XP.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic effect and cost effectiveness of a targeted 
catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention intervention in 
the nursing home (NH) setting.
DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
SETTING: Community-based NHs (N=12).
PARTICIPANTS: NH residents with indwelling urinary catheters (N=418).
INTERVENTION: Standard care versus infection prevention program involving 
barrier precautions, active surveillance, and NH staff education.
MEASUREMENTS: Costs of the intervention, costs of disease, and health outcomes 
were used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 
intervention. Data came from intervention results and the literature and 
outcomes were analyzed over one year.
RESULTS: A 120-bed NH would have program costs of $20,279/year. The cost of 
disease treatment would be reduced by $54,316 per year, resulting in a $34,037 
net cost savings. Most of this savings would come from fewer CAUTI 
hospitalizations ($39,180), with $15,136 in savings from CAUTI care within the 
NH. The intervention also yielded a gain of 0.197 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Taking into account uncertainty in all parameters suggests there is an 
85% chance that the intervention is cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: The CAUTI prevention program is expected to benefit payers by 
reducing costs and improving health outcomes. Because the savings accrue to 
payers and not to NHs, payers such as Medicare and private insurers may want to 
provide incentives for NHs to implement such programs.

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of malignant ascites (MA) and feasibility of 
the management with free drainage remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study the success of drainage, complications, and survival after 
paracentesis or insertion of an indwelling tunneled catheter (TC) for the MA 
performed on a day-case basis.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We evaluated 118 paracenteses and 48 insertions of TCs 
performed in 104 patients with MA at the Palliative Care Outpatient Unit of 
Tampere University Hospital.
RESULTS: Drainage of ascites fluid (median 3700 mL; range 300-13,200 mL) was 
successful in all cases. The complication rates were 7% and 25% for paracenteses 
and TCs, respectively. Most of the complications were minor. Repeated procedures 
were needed in 64% and 10% of the paracenteses and insertions of TCs, 
respectively, (p < 0.001). Median survival after the first procedure was 40 days 
(interquartile range, IQR: 17-115). Patients with pancreatic cancer had shorter 
median survival (19 days; IQR: 9-35) compared with other patients (47 days; IQR: 
23-143) (age-adjusted HR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.65-4.52), whereas patients receiving 
chemotherapy had longer median survival (112 days; IQR: 43-205) compared with 
patients without chemotherapy (25 days; IQR: 14-52) (age-adjusted HR 2.48; 95% 
CI: 1.58-3.89). The volume of removed ascites fluid was not associated with 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Free drainage of MA seems feasible in an outpatient clinic. Early 
insertion of TC should be considered to avoid repeated paracenteses. However, in 
patients with pancreatic cancer, paracentesis might be an accepted alternative 
due to their short life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Hip replacements are successful in restoring mobility, reducing 
pain, and improving quality of life. However, the association between THA and 
the potential for increased life expectancy (as expressed by mortality rate) is 
less clear, and any such association could well be influenced by diagnosis and 
patient-related, socioeconomic, and surgical factors, which have not been well 
studied.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) After controlling for birth year and sex, are Swedish 
patients who underwent THA likely to survive longer than individuals in the 
general population? (2) After controlling for relevant patient-related, 
socioeconomic/demographic factors and surgical factors, does relative survival 
differ across the various diagnoses for which THAs were performed in Sweden?
METHODS: Data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, linked to 
administrative health databases, were used for this study. We identified 131,808 
patients who underwent THA between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2012. Of 
these, 21,755 had died by the end of followup. Patient- and surgery-specific 
data in combination with socioeconomic data were available for analysis. We 
compared patient survival (relative survival) with age- and sex-matched survival 
data in the entire Swedish population according to Statistics Sweden. We used 
multivariable modeling proceeded with a Cox proportional hazards model in 
transformed time.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing elective THA had a slightly improved survival rate 
compared with the general population for approximately 10 years after surgery. 
At 1 year after surgery, the survival in patients undergoing THA was 1% better 
than the expected survival (r = 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.02; p 
< 0.001); at 5 years, this increased to 3% (r = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.03; p < 
0.001); at 10 years, the difference was 2% (r = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03; p < 
0.001); and by 12 years, there was no difference between patients undergoing THA 
and the general population (r = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02; p = 0.13). Using the 
diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis as a reference, hip arthroplasties performed 
for sequelae of childhood hip diseases had a similar survival rate (hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88-1.18; p = 0.77). Patients undergoing surgery for 
osteonecrosis of the femoral head (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.60-1.79; p < 0.001), 
inflammatory arthritis (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38-1.61; p < 0.001), and secondary 
osteoarthritis (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.03-2.99; p < 0.001) all had poorer relative 
survival. Comorbidities and the Elixhauser comorbidity index had a negative 
association with relative survival. Level of achieved education (middle level of 
education: HR, 0.90, 95% CI, 0.87-0.93, p < 0.001; high level: 0.76, 95% CI, 
0.73-0.80, p < 0.001) and marital status (single status: HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 
1.28-1.38; p < 0.001) were also negatively associated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Whereas it has been known that in most patients, THA improves 
quality of life, this study demonstrates that it also is associated with a 
slightly increased life expectancy that lasts for approximately 10 years after 
surgery, especially among patients whose diagnosis was primary osteoarthritis. 
This adds further proof of a health-economic value for this surgical 
intervention. The reasons for the increase in relative survival are unknown but 
are probably multifactorial.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

Life table and predation data were collected for Coccinella septempunctata 
(Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feeding on three different host aphid 
species, Aphis craccivora (Koch) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Lipaphis erysimi 
(Kaltenbach) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: 
Aphididae), under laboratory conditions, using age-stage, two-sex life table. 
The preadult developmental period of C. septempunctata was the shortest on M. 
persicae (21.12 d) and the longest on A. craccivora (28.81 d). Net reproductive 
rate (R0) ranged from 77.31 offspring per individual on A. craccivora to 165.97 
offspring per individual on M. persicae. Mean generation time (T) ranged from 
39.10 d on M. persicae to 51.96 d on L. erysimi. Values of the intrinsic rate of 
increase (r) decreased in the order M. persicae, A. craccivora, and L. erysimi 
(0.1302, 0.0864 and 0.0848 d-1, respectively). The highest finite rate of 
increase (λ) was observed on M. persicae (1.1391 d-1) and the lowest was 
observed on A. craccivora and L. erysimi (1.0903 and 1.0885 d-1, respectively). 
This information will be useful in relation to the mass rearing of C. 
septempunctata in biological control systems.

We compared rearing Harmonia dimidiata (F.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on four 
combinations of Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and eggs of 
Bactrocera dorsalis Hendel (Diptera: Tephritidae), using the age-stage, two-sex 
life table. The four combinations were: both larvae and adults were reared on 
aphids; larvae were reared on aphids and adults were reared on fresh fruit fly 
eggs; larvae were reared on lyophilized fruit fly eggs and adults were reared on 
aphids; and larvae were reared on lyophilized eggs and adults were reared on 
fresh eggs. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.1125 d-1) and net 
reproductive rate (R0 = 260.7 offspring) were observed when both larval and 
adult stages of H. dimidiata were reared on A. gossypii. When B. dorsalis eggs 
were used as rearing media for larvae, adults, or both, the values of r and R0 
were significantly decreased. The lowest values (r = 0.0615 d-1 and R0 = 38.6 
offspring) were observed when both larvae and adults were reared entirely on B. 
dorsalis eggs. Despite the lower r and R0 values, our results showed that B. 
dorsalis eggs could be considered as an adequate, less expensive alternative 
diet for rearing H. dimidiata because of the time and labor savings resulting 
from the ease of preparation and the ability to store the eggs for timely usage. 
The mass-rearing analysis showed that the most economical rearing system was to 
rear larvae on A. gossypii and adults on B. dorsalis eggs.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that diabetes may impact work productivity. In 
the current study, we sought to estimate the lifetime and population impact of 
diabetes on productivity using the novel measure of "productivity-adjusted life 
years" (PALYs).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using age-specific mortality rates and a 
productivity index attributable to diabetes (akin to the quality of life index, 
but which adjusts for reduction in productivity) and life table modeling, we 
estimated years of life and PALYs lost to diabetes among Australians with 
diabetes currently aged 20-65 years, with follow-up until 69 years. Life tables 
were first constructed for the cohort with diabetes and then repeated for the 
same cohort but with the assumption that they no longer had diabetes. The 
"nondiabetic" cohort had lower mortality rates and improved productivity. The 
differences in total years of life lived and PALYs lived between the two cohorts 
reflected the impact of diabetes.
RESULTS: Overall, diabetes reduced total years of life lived by the cohort by 
190,219 years or almost 3%. Diabetes reduced PALYs by 11.6% and 10.5% among men 
and women, respectively. For both sexes, the impact of diabetes on productivity 
was lowest in those aged 65-69 years and highest in those 20-24 years. Among the 
latter, PALYs were reduced by 12.2% and 11.0% for men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of diabetes can prolong life years lived by the whole 
population and increase the amount of productive years lived. Employers and 
government should be aware that having diabetes affects work force productivity 
and implement prevention programs to reduce the impact of diabetes on the 
workforce.

In the initiation of cardiogenesis, the heart primordia transform from bilateral 
flat sheets of mesoderm into an elongated midline tube. Here, we discover that 
this rapid architectural change is driven by actomyosin-based oriented cell 
rearrangement and resulting dynamic tissue reshaping (convergent extension, CE). 
By labeling clusters of cells spanning the entire heart primordia, we show that 
the heart primordia converge toward the midline to form a narrow tube, while 
extending perpendicularly to rapidly lengthen it. Our data for the first time 
visualize the process of early heart tube formation from both the medial 
(second) and lateral (first) heart fields, revealing that both fields form the 
early heart tube by essentially the same mechanism. Additionally, the adjacent 
endoderm coordinately forms the foregut through previously unrecognized 
movements that parallel those of the heart mesoderm and elongates by CE. In 
conclusion, our data illustrate how initially two-dimensional flat primordia 
rapidly change their shapes and construct the three-dimensional morphology of 
emerging organs in coordination with neighboring morphogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the major variables in the estimation of 
health expenditure in OECD member countries with the decision tree method and to 
categorize the member countries by health expenditure.
METHODS: The study population comprised the 2014 data of the 35 OECD countries. 
In the study, health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product was the 
dependent variable while gross domestic product per capita, percentage of total 
population covered by public and private insurance, out-of-pocket health 
expenditure as percentage of total expenditure on health, age dependency ratio, 
life expectancy at birth, number of hospitals per million population, number of 
physicians per 1000 population/head counts, pharmaceutical sales and perceived 
health status were designated as independent variables. The decision tree model 
was constructed with the CART algorithm using the Orange data mining software 
package.
RESULTS: In the study, GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth, age dependency 
ratio, number of hospitals and percentage of the population with a bad perceived 
health status were identified as the major variables in the estimation of health 
expenditure. OECD countries were categorized in 6 groups according to the 
decision tree model. According to the CART algorithm used in the model, the 
classification accuracy rate and the precision of estimation were computed as 
80.56% and 81.25%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study results revealed that the most important determinant for 
estimating the share of GDP allocated to health expenditure was GDP per capita. 
Future studies should be conducted with the inclusion of different variables in 
the model.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview 
of the different types of economic evaluations that can be utilized by Infection 
Prevention and Control practitioners with a particular focus on the use of the 
quality adjusted life year, and its associated challenges. We also highlight 
existing economic evaluations published within Infection Prevention and Control, 
research gaps and future directions.
DESIGN: Narrative Review.
CONCLUSIONS: To date the majority of economic evaluations within Infection 
Prevention and Control are considered partial economic evaluations. 
Acknowledging the challenges, which include variable utilities within infection 
prevention and control, a lack of randomized controlled trials, and difficulty 
in modelling infectious diseases in general, future economic evaluation studies 
should strive to be consistent with published guidelines for economic 
evaluations. This includes the use of quality adjusted life years. Further 
research is required to estimate utility scores of relevance within Infection 
Prevention and Control.

Management of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Older Patients: How Is It 
Different?

Shachar SS, Jolly TA, Jones E, Muss HB.

Triple-negative breast cancer, which affects about 10% of older women with 
breast cancer, represents a major treatment challenge in this population. 
Treatment decisions for these patients can best be made based on geriatric 
assessment, estimated life expectancy, whether the treatment goal is prolonged 
survival or palliation, the potential benefits and toxicities of a specific 
treatment, and the patient's personal goals for treatment. Treatment outcomes 
for healthy older and younger women are similar, but great challenges exist in 
managing the vulnerable and frail patient. The cornerstone of therapy for 
early-stage triple-negative breast cancer is local therapy (surgery and 
radiation) and, for most patients, adjuvant chemotherapy. In the management of 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, all therapy is palliative and 
chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. Since all treatment modalities in older 
patients-especially chemotherapy-can affect physical and mental function, a 
geriatric assessment is key in selecting the most appropriate treatment 
strategy. Many older patients (older than 70 years) are poor candidates for 
state-of-the-art therapy, and some who have substantial comorbidities not 
related to breast cancer may opt for palliative and hospice care. In this 
review, we will discuss the role of geriatric assessment, alternative treatment 
modalities for older women with triple-negative breast cancer, and other special 
considerations for this patient population.

A fascinating aspect of sexual dimorphism in various animal species is that the 
two sexes differ substantially in lifespan. In humans, for example, women's life 
expectancy exceeds that of men by 3-7 years. Whether this trait can be 
attributed to dissimilar lifestyles or genetic (regulatory) factors remains to 
be elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate that in the nematode Caenorhabditis 
elegans, the significantly longer lifespan of hermaphrodites-which are 
essentially females capable of sperm production-over males is established by 
TRA-1, the terminal effector of the sex-determination pathway. This 
transcription factor directly controls the expression of daf-16/FOXO, which 
functions as a major target of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and key modulator 
of aging across diverse animal phyla. TRA-1 extends hermaphrodite lifespan 
through promoting daf-16 activity. Furthermore, TRA-1 also influences 
reproductive growth in a DAF-16-dependent manner. Thus, the sex-determination 
machinery is an important regulator of IIS in this organism. These findings 
provide a mechanistic insight into how longevity and development are specified 
unequally in the two genders. As TRA-1 is orthologous to mammalian GLI 
(glioma-associated) proteins, a similar sex-specific mechanism may also operate 
in humans to determine lifespan.

Favorable Short-Term and Long-Term Outcomes Among Patients With Prior History of 
Malignancy Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now the treatment 
of choice for high-surgical risk patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis. 
Little is known regarding the outcome of TAVR in patients with previous 
malignancy.
METHODS: We investigated 477 patients who underwent TAVR in a tertiary medical 
center. Subjects were divided into two groups according to malignancy status: no 
history of malignancy (n = 386) and positive history of malignancy (n = 91).
RESULTS: Mean age of the study population was 81 ± 7 years, and 52% were men. No 
major differences in baseline characteristics were found between groups. 
All-cause mortality was 24% for both malignancy and non-malignancy groups at a 
mean follow-up of 851 ± 629 days. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated no 
difference in all-cause mortality between groups. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis showed that malignancy status did not affect prognosis regarding 
overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.5-1.4; P=.46). However, cancer therapy administered within 12-months of TAVR 
was significantly associated with increased total mortality among patients 
undergoing TAVR (HR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.14-16.77; P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Malignancy is a common comorbidity among TAVR candidates. Mere 
history of malignancy among elderly patients does not adversely affect 
short-term or long-term outcomes after TAVR; however, history of recent (<1 
year) cancer-related treatment increases the risk for long-term mortality after 
TAVR. Decisions regarding TAVR among oncological patients should be 
individualized according to their malignancy status and anticipated life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is a common problem in developed societies. The quest 
for methods to reduce this com-plaint may contribute to improving the quality of 
life for many people. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of Swedish 
massage combined with acupressure vs. Swedish massage alone in patients with low 
back pain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 20 women and 20 men with lumbosacral 
pain. The group was clinically ho-mo-geneous. The participants were randomized 
into two groups: Group 1, which received Swedish massage with acu-pressure 
techniques, and Group 2, treated with Swedish massage only. The research tools 
comprised the Laitinen Pain Score, the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire, the Roland-Morris Ques-tion-naire, the Thomayer test, and the 
measurement of lumbar spine extension. Differences between the mea-surements 
were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test, with the minimum significance level set 
at p≤0.05.
RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in pain 
intensity, improvement in quality of life and increase in physical activity. 
Increased segmental mobility of the spine was also observed in all patients, 
with significant changes (p&lt;0.05) noted only in Group 1. In Group 2, the 
differences tended towards significance.
CONCLUSION: In selected cases, Swedish massage combined with acupressure 
techniques may be more effective as a mo-notherapy in patients with non-specific 
low back pain than massage alone.

INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched in February 2017 
"Rehabilitation 2030: a call for action". This is likely to have a deep impact 
in the Health Systems in the next few years. The new Cochrane Rehabilitation 
Field has been invited by WHO as a relevant stakeholder in this effort. WHO 
recognizes the dramatic changes in health and demographic profiles of 
populations that are characterizing the 21st century. Main goals of WHO are to 
ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and to promote 
healthy life expectancy.
