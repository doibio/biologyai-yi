significantly associated with malnutrition. Geriatric malnutrition can 
accelerate disability conditions, leading to early functional aging.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dental caries is an infectious disease affecting virtually 
all nations, including Rwanda. In Rwanda, the burden of dental caries is an 
issue of public health concern. To ensure the progressive eradication of the 
current dental caries burden in Rwanda through an evidence-based approach, it is 
imperative to have an overview of the scientific research landscape of dental 
caries in the country. This study-a scoping review-aims to review the available 
evidence and gaps on dental caries in Rwanda.
METHODS: This scoping review was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items 
for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
checklist. A systematic search of 11 databases was done to scoop out all 
literature relevant to the topic. Based on the review's selection criteria, a 
total of eight peer-reviewed journal articles were included in the review. The 
extracted data were collated, summarized, and presented as results.
RESULTS: The analysis of the data extracted from the included articles revealed 
a high prevalence of dental caries (ranging from 42.42% to 71.5%) in Rwanda. 
Also, the major pathogens causing dental caries in Rwanda as well as the impact 
of dental caries on the physical health and quality of life of Rwandans were 
identified in this review. Furthermore, the reported operative treatment options 
for dental caries in Rwanda were predominantly nonconservative. Also, no 
intervention study has been conducted on dental caries in Rwanda.
CONCLUSION: The findings in this review identify the need for massive public 
health interventions on dental caries in Rwanda.

Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare inherited disorder of iron regulation leading 
to iron overload, which usually presents before the age of 30. One of the most 
serious clinical characteristics associated with early-onset iron overload is 
liver disease with eventual cirrhosis, often associated with a reduced life 
expectancy even after treatment. This case report summarizes an asymptomatic 
pediatric patient with persistently elevated transaminase levels, which led to a 
diagnosis of juvenile hemochromatosis relatively early in the course of his 
disease. The aim of this case report is to increase awareness and stress the 
importance of early diagnosis and treatment, as it is vital to prevent 
life-threatening complications and optimize patient outcomes. Consideration 
should be taken to recognize potential manifestations despite the rarity of the 
condition. Patients with signs of hepatocellular injury without explanation 
should prompt evaluation including consideration for iron overload after other 
common causes are ruled out.

Managing a malignant renal tumor requires, first of all, a reflection on the 
necessity of its treatment. It must consider the renal function, altered at the 
time of diagnosis in 50% of cases. The treatment method chosen depends on many 
factors, in particular, the predicted residual renal function, the risk of 
chronic kidney disease, the need for temporary or long-term dialysis, and 
overall long-term survival. Other factors include the size, position, and number 
of tumors and a hereditary tumor background. When a renal-sparing management 
alternative is available, total nephrectomy should no longer be performed in 
patients with small malignant renal masses (cT1a). This may consist of surgery 
(partial nephrectomy or lumpectomy), percutaneous thermo-ablation (by 
radiofrequency, microwave, or cryotherapy). In patients with limited life 
expectancy, imaging-based surveillance may be proposed to suggest treatment in 
case of local progression. Good coordination between urologist, radiologist, 
nephrologist, and sometimes radiotherapist should allow optimal management of 
patients with a malignant renal tumor with or without underlying renal failure.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the life expectancy following the 
first cardiovascular disease (CVD) event by type 2 diabetes (T2D) status and 
ethnicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database in 
England (UK), linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics information, to identify 
individuals with and without T2D who survived a first CVD event between 1st Jan 
2007 and 31st Dec 2017; subsequent death events were extracted from the Office 
for National Statistics database. Ethnicity was categorised as White, South 
Asian (SA), Black, or other. Flexible parametric survival models were used to 
estimate survival and predict life expectancy. 59,939 individuals with first CVD 
event were included: 7596 (12.7%) with T2D (60.9% men; mean age at event: 69.7 
years [63.2 years in SA, 65.9 in Black, 70.2 in White]) and 52,343 without T2D 
(56.7% men; 65.9 years [54.7 in Black, 58.2 in SA, 66.3 in White]). Accounting 
for potential confounders (sex, deprivation, lipid-lowering medication, current 
smoking, and pre-existing hypertension), comparing individuals with vs without 
T2D the mortality rate was 53% higher in White (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.53 [95% CI: 
1.44, 1.62]), corresponding to a potential loss of 3.87 (3.30, 4.44) life years 
at the age of 50 years in individuals with T2D. No evidence of a difference in 
life expectancy was observed in individuals of SA (HR: 0.82 [0.52, 1.29]; -1.36 
[-4.58, 1.86] life years), Black (HR: 1.26 [0.59, 2.70]; 1.21 [-2.99, 5.41] life 
years); and other (HR: 1.64 [0.80, 3.39]; 3.89 [-2.28, 9.99] life years) ethnic 
group.
CONCLUSION: Following a CVD event, T2D is associated with a different prognosis 
and life years lost among ethnic groups.

Bias compensated pseudolinear Kalman filter (BC-PLKF) degrades for bearings-only 
tracking if measurements are corrupted with time-correlated noises. Generalized 
bias compensated pseudolinear Kalman filter (GBC-PLKF), on the other hand, 
outperforms BC-PLKF and many other comparison filters for two-dimensional (2D) 
cases under colored noise. However, GBC-PLKF is not practicable for 
three-dimensional (3D) real-life problems and due to the coupling between 
lateral and longitudinal planes, its 3D extension is not trivial. In this paper, 
bias analysis of 3D pseudolinear Kalman filter (PLKF) with azimuth and elevation 
measurements including colored noise is performed. Then, the low-cost recursive 
filter, 3D-GBC-PLKF is proposed for 3D real-life applications. The performance 
and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated with an 
air-to-surface guided missile pursuing a typical target.

BACKGROUND: Pacific walruses are found in Arctic regions of the Chukchi and 
Bering Sea where rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting in loss of 
sea ice are occurring. Therefore, accurate life history data are crucial for 
species management plans and longitudinal data collected over the lives of 
individual walruses housed in zoos and aquaria provide otherwise difficult to 
obtain biological information.
RESULTS: While similar at birth, Gompertz regression curves indicated that males 
grew faster than females (p < 0.0001) in weight (99 kg vs 57.6 kg/y) and length 
(26.9 cm vs 26.3 cm/y) with physical differences being detected by age 3 for 
weight and age 7 for length. Males reached adult weight at 13.5 ± 3.3 y and 
females by age 12.3 ± 2.3 y. The mean age at first ovulation and at first 
conception occurred at 8.8 y and 9.6 y. Greater than 75% of all conceptions and 
calving occurred between February and March and from May to June, respectively. 
Mean gestation lasted 423 d and false pregnancies lasted at least 169 d with a 
decrease (p < 0.05) in serum progesterone concentration between false pregnancy 
and pregnancy occurring within 6 months after ovulation. Based on these results, 
we estimated embryonic diapause to last from 120 to 139 days, and fetal growth 
last ~ 284 days. All males older than 8 y had an increase in serum testosterone 
and body weight that was highest in February and lowest in July. Overall, no 
differences were observed between male and female survival, with a mean (± SEM) 
life expectancy of 19.5 ± 1.5 y, respectively. Currently, the oldest male and 
female captive walruses are 40 and 43 y, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Data provided herein include details of life history 
characteristics of zoo and aquaria housed walruses that are useful for wild 
population recovery models. In particular, results on survivorship and the 
identification of the most vulnerable period for calf survival can help with 
model development and suggests that for recovery to occur birthing locations for 
this species must be protected.

BACKGROUND: There is a crucial need to devise optimum rehabilitation programs 
for children with cerebral palsy (CP).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of 
combining 6-Hz primed, low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) with modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) in 
improving upper limb function in children with unilateral CP.
METHODS: Children aged 5 to 18 years with unilateral CP were randomized (23 in 
each arm) to receive 10 sessions of mCIMT with real rTMS (intervention arm) or 
mCIMT with sham rTMS (control arm), on alternate weekdays over 4 weeks. The 
primary outcome was the difference in mean change in Quality of Upper Extremity 
Skills Test (QUEST) scores. Secondary outcomes were changes in QUEST domain 
scores, speed and strength measures, CP quality of life (CP-QOL) scale scores, 
and safety of rTMS.
RESULTS: All 46 children completed the trial except one. At 4 weeks, the mean 
change in total QUEST scores was significantly higher in the intervention arm as 
compared to the control arm (11.66 ± 6.97 vs 6.56 ± 4.3, d = 5.1, 95% CI 
1.7-8.5, P = .004). Change in "weight bearing" and "protective extension" domain 
score was significantly higher for children in the intervention arm. These 
improvements were sustained at 12 weeks (P = .028). CP-QOL scores improved at 
12 weeks. No serious adverse events were seen.
CONCLUSION: A 6-Hz primed rTMS combined with mCIMT is safe, feasible, and 
superior to mCIMT alone in improving the upper limb function of children with 
unilateral CP.

Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation for Older Transplant Candidates: A New 
Microsimulation Model for Determining Risks and Benefits.

Center for Health Policy, Freeman Spogli Institute, Stanford University,

USA.

BACKGROUND: Under the current US kidney allocation system, older candidates 
receive a disproportionately small share of deceased donor kidneys despite a 
reserve of potentially usable kidneys that could shorten their wait times. To 
consider potential health gains from increasing access to kidneys for these 
candidates, we developed and calibrated a microsimulation model of the 
transplantation process and long-term outcomes for older deceased donor kidney 
transplant candidates.
METHODS: We estimated risk equations for transplant outcomes using the 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), which contains data on all 
US transplants (2010-2019). A microsimulation model combined these equations to 
account for competing events. We calibrated the model to key transplant outcomes 
and used acceptance sampling, retaining the best-fitting 100 parameter sets. We 
then examined life expectancy gains from allocating kidneys even of lower 
quality across patient subgroups defined by age and designated race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: The best-fitting 100 parameter sets (among 4,000,000 sampled) enabled 
our model to closely match key transplant outcomes. The model demonstrated clear 
survival benefits for those who receive a deceased donor kidney, even a lower 
quality one, compared with remaining on the waitlist where there is a risk of 
removal. The expected gain in survival from receiving a lower quality donor 
kidney was consistent gains across age and race/ethnic subgroups.
LIMITATIONS: Limited available data on socioeconomic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our microsimulation model accurately replicates a range of key 
kidney transplant outcomes among older candidates and demonstrates that older 
candidates may derive substantial benefits from transplantation with lower 
quality kidneys. This model can be used to evaluate policies that have been 
proposed to address concerns that the current system disincentivizes deceased 
donor transplants for older patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: The microsimulation model was consistent with the data after 
calibration and accurately simulated the transplantation process for older 
deceased donor kidney transplant candidates.There are clear survival benefits 
for older transplant candidates who receive deceased donor kidneys, even lower 
quality ones, compared with remaining on the waitlist.This model can be used to 
evaluate policies aimed at increasing transplantation among older candidates.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating condition, with a life 
expectancy of 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. Pirfenidone is a drug that has been 
shown to reduce the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). We sought to 
identify whether different patterns on high-resolution computed tomography 
(HRCT) have different clinical effects through a retrospective comparison of 
baseline values and changes in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) after treatment 
with pirfenidone. We retrospectively analyzed data from IPF patients treated 
with pirfenidone at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital in Jiangsu Province, China. 
According to the HRCT pattern, the patients were divided into usual interstitial 
pneumonitis (UIP) and possible UIP groups. Baseline clinical characteristics and 
changes every 6 months in the PFTs during the follow-up period were compared 
between the 2 groups. A total of 65 consecutive patients were enrolled. 
According to the HRCT pattern, patients were clustered into the UIP group 
(n = 46) and possible UIP group (n = 19). No difference was observed in the 
baseline PFTs ratio between the 2 groups. The FVC values of the 2 groups were 
not significantly different at the initial treatment and at 6 and 12 months 
after pirfenidone treatment (P = .081, 0.099, and 0.236, respectively). The 
improvement in % diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) was 
higher in the possible UIP group after 6 and 12 months of pirfenidone treatment 
(P = .149, 0.026, and 0.025, respectively). The annual decrease in FVC was not 
significantly different between the 2 groups, and the annual decrease in %DLCO 
in the UIP group was significantly higher than that in patients with the 
possible UIP type (-7.767 ± 12.797 vs 0.342 ± 20.358, P < .05). These results 
indicate that patients with IPF with a possible UIP pattern on HRCT showed 
indications of a good response to pirfenidone.

The capacity to learn and memorize is a key determinant for the quality of life 
but is known to decline to varying degrees with age. However, neural correlates 
of memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which 
aging affects learning are still not well understood. By employing a visual 
sequence learning task, we were able to track the behavioral and 
neurophysiological markers of gradual learning over several repetitions, which 
is not possible in traditional approaches that utilize a remember vs. forgotten 
comparison. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning-related 
centro-parietal event-related potential (ERP) components: the expectancy-driven 
P300 and memory-related broader positivity (BP). Our results revealed that 
although both age groups showed significant learning progress, young individuals 
learned faster and remembered more stimuli than older participants. Successful 
learning was directly linked to a decrease of P300 and BP amplitudes. However, 
young participants showed larger P300 amplitudes with a sharper decrease during 
the learning, even after correcting for an observed age-related longer P300 
latency and increased P300 peak variability. Additionally, the P300 amplitude 
predicted learning success in both age groups and showed good test-retest 
reliability. On the other hand, the memory formation processes, reflected by the 
BP amplitude, revealed a similar level of engagement in both age groups. 
However, this engagement did not translate into the same learning progress in 
the older participants. We suggest that the slower and more variable timing of 
the stimulus identification process reflected in the P300 means that despite the 
older participants engaging the memory formation process, there is less time for 
it to translate the categorical stimulus location information into a solidified 
memory trace. The results highlight the important role of the P300 and BP as a 
neurophysiological marker of learning and may enable the development of 
preventive measures for cognitive decline.

A category of symptoms that became characteristic early in the first wave of the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was chemosensory dysfunctions 
(alterations of smell and taste). Such symptoms substantially affect food and 
eating-cornerstones for both nutrition-related health outcomes and for quality 
of life. Based on this, this scoping review aimed to map out existing scientific 
literature on food-related experiences and related behavioral responses among 
people affected by chemosensory dysfunctions following COVID-19. A 
librarian-supported search of PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus for publications 
written in English (2020 to April 26, 2022) was conducted. Two authors searched 
for and screened publications and three others extracted and collated data. 
These are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Of 1169 hits, 9 publications 
were included in the review. The results are thematized as "Psychological and 
social aspects" and "Nutritional aspects," each with the subsections 
"Experiences" and "Behavioral responses." A great variety of food-related 
problems, nutritional and mental health effects, and implications for social 
life are identified. People affected by chemosensory dysfunctions following 
COVID-19 suffer, as evident both in stories from qualitative studies and in 
measurements of quality of life. The results impact all professions who are and 
may come to be involved in treating these patients, such as nurses, physicians, 
dietitians, and psychologists. With more knowledge about the dysfunctions' 
manifestation, duration, and impact on everyday life, multiprofessional teams 
need to collaborate in supporting patients medically, psychosocially, and 
nutritionally.

BACKGROUND: The digitization of health care led to a steady increase in the 
adoption and use of mobile health (mHealth) apps. Germany is the first country 
in the world to cover the costs of mHealth apps through statutory health 
insurance. Although the benefits of mHealth apps are discussed in detail, 
aspects of problems and barriers are rarely studied.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to map and categorize the evidence on 
problems and barriers related to the use of mHealth apps.
METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in the MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO 
databases. Additional searches were conducted on JMIR Publications and on 
websites of relevant international organizations. The inclusion criteria were 
publications dealing with apps similar to those approved in the German health 
care system, publications addressing problems and barriers related to the use of 
mHealth apps, and articles published between January 1, 2015, and June 8, 2021. 
Study selection was performed by 2 reviewers. The manuscript was drafted 
according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. The analysis of the 
included publications and categorization of problems and hurdles were performed 
using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH).
RESULTS: The database search identified 1479 publications. Of the 1479 
publications, 21 (1.42%) met the inclusion criteria. A further 8 publications 
were included from citation searching and searching in JMIR Publications. The 
identified publications were analyzed for problems and barriers. Problems and 
barriers were classified into 10 categories ("validity," "usability," 
"technology," "use and adherence," "data privacy and security," 
"patient-physician relationship," "knowledge and skills," "individuality," 
"implementation," and "costs"). The most frequently mentioned categories were 
use and adherence (eg, incorporating the app into daily life or dropouts from 
use; n=22) and usability (eg, ease of use and design; n=19).
CONCLUSIONS: The search identified various problems and barriers in the context 
of mHealth apps. Although problems at the app level (such as usability) are 
studied frequently, problems at the system level are addressed rather vaguely. 
To ensure optimal use of and care with mHealth apps, it is essential to consider 
all types of problems and barriers. Therefore, researchers and policy makers 
should have a special focus on this issue to identify the needs for quality 
assurance.

Effects of Kinesio Taping for Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain: A Systematic 
Review and Meta-analysis.

Pan L, Li Y, Gao L, Sun Y, Li M, Zhang X, Wang Y, Shi B.

CONTEXT: Chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP) is a common musculoskeletal 
disorder that seriously affects patients' quality of life (QoL). Clinicians have 
used Kinesio Taping (KT) in the treatment of CNLBP patients, but evidence is 
still lacking on the benefits of KT for CNLBP.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
the currently published randomized controlled trails (RCTs) to determine KT's 
efficacy for CNLBP patients.
DESIGN: The research team performed a literature search using five major 
electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE 
and OpenGrey-and included studies form inception to January 2018. The search 
used the keywords "kinesio tap*", "kinesio*", and "chronic low back pain (CLBP)" 
or "CNLBP".
SETTING: The study took place in the 942 Hospital of the Joint Logistics Support 
Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team performed the meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 
software. The team selected studies that used pain intensity and disability as 
the primary outcome measures, and if the study used other outcomes, they had to 
be the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The systematic review included nine RCTs in the meta-analysis. KT can 
significantly reduce pain intensity between baseline and immediately 
postintervention (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.02, P = .04) and between 
baseline and the short-term follow-up period (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI -0.44 to 
-0.20, P = .03). However, no significant differences existed between KT's 
ability to relieve other symptoms of CNLBP-disability, trunk flexion range of 
motion (ROM), change in status, fear of movement, isometric endurance of the 
trunk muscles, or extension-when compared to either sham taping or KT as an 
adjunct to physical therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: KT can have immediate and short-term positive effects on reducing 
pain intensity, but existing evidence doesn't support KT's superiority to other 
interventions in improving functions for individuals with CNLBP.

BACKGROUND: Post-procedural aortic insufficiency (AI) continues to be prevalent 
following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). While several studies 
have assessed the outcomes of moderate-severe AI following TAVR, the incidence, 
predictors, and outcomes of mild AI remain unclear.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies 
reporting on mild AI following TAVR. The primary outcome was pooled incidence of 
post-TAVR mild AI. Secondary outcomes included pooled incidence of mild AI at 30 
days and long term. The pooled incidence of midterm mortality in patients with 
post-TAVR mild AI was also evaluated. The random effect generalized linear 
mixed-effects model with logit-transformed proportions and Hartung-Knapp 
adjustment was used to calculate pooled incidence rates. Meta-regression was 
performed to identify predictors of mild AI.
RESULTS: The pooled analysis included 19,241 patients undergoing TAVR across 50 
studies. The mean age of patients ranged from 73 to 85 years, and female 
patients ranged from 20.0% to 83.3%. The overall pooled incidence of post-TAVR 
mild AI was 56.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.64). The pooled incidence 
of mild AI at 30 days was 33.7% (95% CI 0.12-0.37). At mean follow-up of 1.15 
years, the pooled incidence of mild AI was 37.0% (95% CI 0.16-0.45). The overall 
pooled incidence of Midterm mortality (mean follow-up 1.22 years) in patients 
with mild AI was 14.8% (95% CI 0.10-0.25). At meta-regression, none of the 
explored variables correlated with a difference in mild AI incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: In published studies to date, 50% of patients undergoing TAVR 
develop mild AI postoperatively. In 37% of patients, this persists in long term. 
Though the incidence of AI is likely improving with newer generation TAVR 
valves, the prevalence and outcomes of mild AI should be closely monitored as 
TAVR volume and indications expand to younger patients with long life 
expectancy. The long-term outcomes of mild AI remain unclear. Further dedicated 
studies on post-TAVR mild AI are needed.

People with schizophrenia (SCZ) have a shorter life expectancy than those 
without psychiatric conditions. Of note, people with SCZ have high rates of 
cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity. These factors all coalesce 
to contribute to compromised health in this population, with smoking as a 
primary contributor. Therefore, it is paramount to develop effective smoking 
cessation strategies for this population. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate whether walking at a brisk pace, relative to engaging in passive 
activity, would reduce acute cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal, and 
negative affect (NA) among people with SCZ who smoke cigarettes. Using a 
within-subjects design, twenty participants completed four laboratory sessions 
with condition sequence counterbalanced: 1) exposure to smoking cues + treadmill 
walking, 2) exposure to neutral cues + treadmill walking, 3) exposure to smoking 
cues + passive/sedentary activity, 4) exposure to neutral 
cues + passive/sedentary activity. Relative to sedentary activity, walking 
resulted in greater decreases in nicotine withdrawal but did not significantly 
affect craving or NA. These results did not vary as a function of cue type. 
These findings suggest that walking may be a helpful strategy to reduce acute 
nicotine withdrawal symptoms among people with SCZ. However, it should be used 
in conjunction with other strategies for smoking cessation.

The infection caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has spread 
rapidly across the globe, assuming the characteristics of an epidemic in some 
regions. Thanks to the introduction of antiretroviral therapy into routine 
clinical practice, there was a considerable breakthrough in the treatment of 
HIV, that is now HIV is potentially well-controlled even in low-income 
countries. To date, HIV infection has moved from the group of life-threatening 
conditions to the group of chronic and well controlled ones and the quality of 
life and life expectancy of HIV+ people, with an undetectable viral load is 
closer to that of an HIV- people. However, unsolved issues still persist. For 
example: people living with HIV are more prone to the age-related diseases, 
especially atherosclerosis. For this reason, a better understanding of the 
mechanisms of HIV-associated destabilization of vascular homeostasis seems to be 
an urgent duty, that may lead to the development of new protocols, bringing the 
possibilities of pathogenetic therapies to a new level. The purpose of the 
article was to evaluate the pathological aspects of HIV-induced atherosclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  Over a billion people in the world live with some form of disability 
and this figure is destined to grow due to the increase in life expectancy. As 
consequence, the caregiver is taking on an increasingly important role that 
gains relevance also in the field of oral-dental prevention, being able to 
promptly identify needs for medical treatment. In some cases, however, the 
caregiver can be an obstacle to consider in case of a lack of adequate knowledge 
and commitment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the caregiver level of oral 
education comparing family members and health workers dedicated to people with 
disabilities knowledge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Anonymous questionnaires were distributed in five 
disability service centers and filled alternatively by family members of 
patients with disability and disability service centers health workers.
RESULTS:  Two-hundred fifty questionnaires were collected, of which 100 were 
filled in by family members and 150 by health workers. Data were analyzed by 
applying the chi-squared (X2) independence test and the pairwise method for 
missing data.
CONCLUSION:  Family members oral education appears better in terms of brushing 
frequency, toothbrush replacement, and number of dental visits.

OBJECTIVES: An up-to-date, detailed global analysis of the current status of the 
metabolic-attributed cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden has not been reported. 
Therefore, we investigated the global burden of metabolic-attributed CVD and its 
association with socioeconomic development status over the past 30 years.
METHODS: Data on the burden of metabolic-attributed CVD were taken from the 2019 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Metabolic risk factors of CVD included 
high fasting plasma glucose, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), 
high systolic blood pressure (SBP), high body mass index (BMI) and kidney 
dysfunction. Numbers and age-standardised rates (ASR) of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) and deaths were extracted and stratified by sex, age, 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) level, country and region.
RESULTS: The ASR of metabolic-attributed CVD DALYs and deaths decreased by 28.0% 
(95% UI 23.8% to 32.5%) and 30.4% (95% UI 26.6% to 34.5%), respectively, from 
1990 to 2019. The highest burden of metabolic-attributed total CVD and 
intracerebral haemorrhage was mainly in low SDI locations, while the highest
