Glioblastomas account for approximately 20% of all primary brain tumors in 
adults. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant tumor. In spite of 
advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the life expectancy of the 
patient with glioblastoma is approximately 11 months. To enhance glioma-specific 
gene delivery, we employed a 12-mer phage display peptide library to isolate 
phages that bind specifically to human glioma cell lines. Here, we report the 
isolation and functional characterization of novel glioma-specific peptides that 
target transgenes specifically to a wide array of human glioblastomas in vitro 
and in vivo. One of the isolated peptides, tentatively denoted as MG11, is 
demonstrated to be glioma specific and gives an in vitro-binding enrichment of 
more than 5-fold for glioma cells when compared with nonglioma cells. 
Intravenous injection of phages bearing the MG11 peptide-binding motif enables 
the phages to home specifically to glioma xenografts. Most significantly, when 
Lissamine rhodamine-labeled MG11 peptide is injected intratumorally, it targets 
specifically to glioma xenografts instead of non-glioma-derived xenografts. In 
summary, our results suggest that the MG11 peptide is able to target 
specifically to tumors of glial origin, which would allow the design of 
applications related to the diagnosis and treatment of human gliomas.

Pedestrian and pedalcyclist injury costs in the United States by age and injury 
severity.

This paper estimates the incidence, unit costs, and annual costs of pedestrian 
and pedalcycle crash injuries in the United States. It includes medical care 
costs, household and wage work losses, and the value of pain, suffering, and 
lost quality of life. The estimates are broken down by body region and severity. 
They rely heavily on data from the health care system. Costs of pedestrian and 
pedalcycle injuries in 2000 will total 40 billion dollars over the lifetimes of 
the injured. Most pedalcyclist injury costs and half of pedestrian injury costs 
do not involve motor vehicles. Youth ages 5-14 face greater annual risks when 
walking or driving their own pedaled vehicles than when being driven. Children 
under age 5 experience higher costs than their elders when injured as 
pedestrians. Our results suggest European and Japanese component tests used to 
design pedestrian injury countermeasures for motor vehicles are too narrow. 
Separate lower limb testing is needed for younger children. Testing for 
torso/vertebral column injury of adults also seems desirable.

Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: The SF-12 is a multidimensional generic measure of health-related 
quality of life. It has become widely used in clinical trials and routine 
outcome assessment because of its brevity and psychometric performance, but it 
cannot be used in economic evaluation in its current form.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to derive a preference-based measure of health from the 
SF-12 for use in economic evaluation and to compare it with the original SF-36 
preference-based index.
RESEARCH DESIGN: The SF-12 was revised into a 6-dimensional health state 
classification (SF-6D [SF-12]) based on an item selection process designed to 
ensure the minimum loss of descriptive information.
SUBJECTS: A sample of 241 states defined by the SF-6D (of 7500) have been valued 
by a representative sample of 611 members of the UK general population using the 
standard gamble (SG) technique.
ANALYSIS: Models are estimated of the relationship between the SF-6D (SF-12) and 
SG values and evaluated in terms of their coefficients, overall fit, and the 
ability to predict SG values for all health states.
RESULTS: The models have produced significant coefficients for levels of the 
SF-6D (SF-12), which are robust across model specification. The coefficients are 
similar to those of the SF-36 version and achieve similar levels of fit. There 
are concerns with some inconsistent estimates and these have been merged to 
produce the final recommended model. As for the SF-36 model, there is evidence 
of over prediction of the value of the poorest health states.
CONCLUSIONS: The SF-12 index provides a useful tool for researchers and policy 
makers wishing to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

Bluff, Illinois, USA.

BACKGROUND: Transforming generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
instruments to a summary utility index is useful for deriving quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) in any cost/QALY analysis.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the SF-12 in 
predicting utility scores derived from Health Utility Index (HUI3) and Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS).
METHOD: Data were obtained from a survey of 6923 managed care patients in the 
United States, aged 18 to 93 years, selected by strata of medication usage (at 
least 1 medication in target year, 5 or more medications, target medications, 
and both). The SF-12 was used to assess self-reported HRQOL. Utility was 
measured by the HUI3 and a VAS. The SF-12 items were used to predict HUI3 and 
VAS scores using ordinary least square regressions, with sociodemographic 
covariates. A second model entered each SF-12 item as categorized responses. A 
third model used the Physical Composite and Mental Composite scores to predict 
HUI3 and VAS scores.
RESULTS: The SF-12 items and sociodemographic covariates accounted for 35% to 
55% of the variations in HUI3 and VAS scores, respectively. Age and most SF-12 
items were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with both utility scores in all 
3 models.
CONCLUSIONS: This research provides support that an algorithm can be derived 
from the SF-12 to estimate utility scores based on the HUI3 and VAS for studies 
in populations where utility has not or cannot be measured directly.

Obesity has attained epidemic proportions in the United States, with more than 
50% of adults classified as overweight or obese. If untreated, morbidly obese 
patients have a 1 in 7 chance of reaching normal life expectancy. The surgical 
treatment of obesity has emerged as the most effective treatment modality in 
long-term weight control and has become increasingly popular, with attendant 
postoperative complications and death. We performed a cross-sectional, coroner 
based, 2-year retrospective review of archival case records for decedents who 
died following bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity to identify 
underlying causes of death and forensic characteristics of this cohort. Fifteen 
(0.5%) out of 3097 archival cases died following bariatric surgery, with 
approximately 73% of decedents dying within 6 months of surgery. The underlying 
causes of death in 80% of decedents were natural comorbidities of obesity, with 
cardiovascular diseases (33%) being the most frequent causes of death, followed 
by gastrointestinal diseases (20%), acute pulmonary thromboembolism (13%), and 
acute bacterial pneumonia (13%). The majority of decedents were white females 
who remained morbidly obese after bariatric surgery. Only 2 decedents died of 
direct inadvertent/accidental surgical complications.

The influence of subjective expectations about length and quality of life on 
time trade-off answers.

The Netherlands.

When answering TTO questions respondents sometimes have to imagine being in a 
certain health state during their remaining lifespan, often based on objective 
life tables. Respondents however may have subjective expectations about length 
and quality of life that differ from the objective ones. If respondents do not 
fully abstract from own expectations, TTO scores may be biased. In this note, we 
indicate how subjective expectations could influence TTO scores and present some 
empirical findings suggesting that they do. Our results indicate that subjective 
expectations may serve as unobserved reference points and as such influence TTO 
responses.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the No. 1 cause of death in the United 
States and, with the exception of 1918, has held that position since 1900. At 
present, 64 million people in the United States have some form of CVD. The 
public health burden caused by CVD continues to affect the country in terms of 
cost, life expectancy, and hospital care.

Cervical spinal metastasis: anterior reconstruction and stabilization techniques 
after tumor resection.

(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake 
City, Utah 84132, USA.

OBJECT: In a review of the literature, the authors provide an overview of 
various techniques that have evolved for reconstruction and stabilization after 
resection for metastatic disease in the subaxial cervical spine.
METHODS: Reconstruction and stabilization of the cervical spine after vertebral 
body (VB) resection for metastatic tumor is an important goal in the surgical 
management of spinal metastasis. Generally, the VB defect is reconstructed with 
bone autograft or allograft, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), interbody spacers, 
and/or cages. In cases of PMMA-assisted reconstruction, internal devices are 
used to augment the fixation of PMMA. Stabilization is then achieved with 
anterior instrumentation, usually an anterior cervical locking plate. In some 
cases, posterior instrumentation may be necessary to supplement the anterior 
construct.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cervical corpectomy followed by reconstruction and 
stabilization is an effective strategy in the management of spinal metastases in 
patients.

The CORE Diabetes Model: Projecting long-term clinical outcomes, costs and 
cost-effectiveness of interventions in diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2) to 
support clinical and reimbursement decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: We have developed an Internet-based, interactive computer model to 
determine the long-term health outcomes and economic consequences of 
implementing different treatment policies or interventions in type 1 and type 2 
diabetes mellitus. The model projects outcomes for populations, taking into 
account baseline cohort characteristics and past history of complications, 
current and future diabetes management and concomitant medications, screening 
strategies and changes in physiological parameters over time. The development of 
complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and total costs 
within populations can be calculated.
METHODS: The model is based on a series of sub-models that simulate important 
complications of diabetes (cardiovascular disease, eye disease, hypoglycaemia, 
nephropathy, neuropathy, foot ulcer, amputation, stroke, ketoacidosis, lactic 
acidosis and mortality). Each sub-model is a Markov model using Monte Carlo 
simulation incorporating time, state, time-in state, and diabetes type-dependent 
probabilities derived from published sources. Analyses can be performed on 
cohorts with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cohorts, defined in terms of age, 
gender, baseline risk factors and pre-existing complications, can be modified or 
new cohorts defined by the user. Economic and clinical data in the model can be 
edited, thus ensuring adaptability by allowing the inclusion of new data as they 
become available; creation of country- or provider-specific versions of the 
model; and allowing the investigation of new hypotheses.
CONCLUSIONS: The CORE Diabetes Model allows the calculation of long-term 
outcomes, based on the best data currently available. Diabetes management 
strategies can be compared in different patient populations in a variety of 
realistic clinical settings, allowing the identification of efficient diabetes 
management strategies.

Comparing the long-term cost-effectiveness of repaglinide plus metformin versus 
nateglinide plus metformin in type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glycaemic 
control: an application of the CORE Diabetes Model in type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: As an example application of the CORE Diabetes Model in type 2 
diabetes, we simulated the cost-effectiveness of repaglinide/metformin 
combination therapy versus nateglinide/metformin for treatment of individuals 
with type 2 diabetes with an inadequate response to sulphonylurea, metformin, or 
fixed dose glyburide/metformin.
METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate long-term outcomes for a 
cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with either 
repaglinide/metformin or nateglinide/metformin. HbA1c changes for each regimen 
were taken from a comparative study. At the end of the study, changes in HbA1c 
from baseline were -1.28% points and -0.67% points for repaglinide/metformin and 
nateglinide/metformin, respectively. Median final doses were 5.0 mg/day for 
repaglinide, 360 mg/day for nateglinide and 2000 mg/day metformin in each 
treatment arm. Costs were calculated as the annual costs for drugs plus costs of 
complications (US Medicare perspective) over a 30-year period. Life expectancy 
(LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) were calculated. Outcomes and 
costs were discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: With repaglinide/metformin, improved glycaemic control led to projected 
decreases in complication rates, improvement of LE and QALE by 0.15 and 0.14 
years respectively, and total cost savings of 3,662 dollars/person over the 
30-year period. Repaglinide/metformin had a 96% probability that the incremental 
costs per quality-adjusted life year gained would be 20,000 dollars or less, and 
a 66% probability that repaglinide/metformin would be cost-saving compared to 
nateglinide/metformin. Sensitivity analyses supported the validity and 
reliability of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: In the health economic context, repaglinide/metformin combination 
was dominant to nateglinide/metformin. The CORE Diabetes Model is a tool to help 
third-party reimbursement payers identify treatments for type 2 diabetes that 
are good value for money.

OBJECTIVES: Various factors influence the risk of complications in type 2 
diabetes patients. The isolated impact of single risk factors on long-term 
outcomes is unclear. The aim of this study was to calculate the projected 
effects on life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted LE (QALE) and total costs of 
complications (TC) of 10% improvements in baseline levels of either total 
cholesterol (T-CHOL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and all four parameters 
combined.
METHODS: A cohort of newly diagnosed patients (baseline age 52 years, HbA1c 
9.1%, SBP 137 mmHg, T-CHOL 212 mg/dL, and HDL 39 mg/dL) was defined. The CORE 
Diabetes Model was used to simulate LE, QALE and TC (US third-party payer 
perspective discounted at 3% annually) over patients' lifetimes, assuming no 
change in risk factors, an isolated 10% improvement in each parameter, or a 10% 
improvement in all parameters simultaneously.
RESULTS: Improved HbA1c led to increases in LE and QALE of 1.00 and 0.81 years 
respectively, and decreased TC of (US) 10,800 dollars/patient. Improved SBP led 
to improvements in LE and QALE of 0.67 and 0.55 years respectively and decreased 
TC of 7,049 dollars. Decreased T-CHOL led to improvements in LE and QALE of 0.29 
and 0.20 years, respectively, and increased TC of 1,923 dollars. Increased HDL 
led to improvements in LE and QALE of 0.28 and 0.18 years respectively, and 
increased TC of 2,162 dollars. Simultaneous improvements in all parameters led 
to projected improvements in LE and QALE of 2.17 and 1.72 years respectively, 
and decreased TC of 14,533 dollars.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined improvements in HbA1c, lipid levels and SBP produced the 
greatest benefits in terms of LE, QALE and TC. A 10% improvement in HbA1c had 
the greatest impact on these three outcomes.

What impact would pancreatic beta-cell preservation have on life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs of complications in patients with 
type 2 diabetes? A projection using the CORE Diabetes Model.

OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is characterised by progressive failure of pancreatic 
beta-cell function against a background of insulin resistance. Multifactorial 
interventions, including intensive glycaemic and blood pressure control, reduce 
the risk of onset and progression of complications. However, current management 
of type 2 diabetes focuses on treatment of signs and symptoms of disease instead 
of targeting underlying causes. A number of newer pharmacological interventions, 
including thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptides, have shown early 
promise in preserving pancreatic beta-cell function. The aim of this study was 
to investigate the impact of stabilising beta-cell function on long-term 
outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to project life expectancy (LE), 
quality-adjusted LE (QALE) and total lifetime complication costs (TC) for a 
cohort of newly-diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, either with a typical 
increase of HbA1c over time as observed in the UKPDS, or assuming stabilisation 
of HbA1c after diagnosis with a hypothetical new treatment, representing 
beta-cell function stabilisation. Costs due to diabetes-related complications 
(from a US third-party payer perspective), were discounted at 3% annually. Both 
non-discounted and discounted (at 3% annually) LE and QALE were calculated. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Over a time period of 50 years, in a cohort with no increase of HbA1c 
over time, LE and QALE were improved by mean (SD) 1.02 (0.36) and 0.96 (0.25) 
years, and total costs of complications were reduced by 6,377 dollars (2,568) 
per patient compared to the cohort with a typical increase in HbA1c over time. 
Results were robust under a wide range of plausible assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: New interventions that stabilise pancreatic betacell function may 
have an important impact on length and quality of life, and lead to reduced 
costs of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Deleterious effects of increased body weight associated with intensive insulin 
therapy for type 1 diabetes: increased blood pressure and worsened lipid profile 
partially negate improvements in life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Weight gain is an unwanted side effect of improved glycaemic control 
in type 1 diabetes, associated with increased blood pressure (BP) and worsening 
lipid profiles. While improved glycaemic control per se should improve long-term 
patient outcomes, increases in BP and worsening lipid profiles may counteract 
these benefits. The aim of this modelling study was to assess whether the 
increased body weight and associated worsening of lipid profile and blood 
pressure would negate the improvements in glycaemic control seen with intensive 
therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: A validated diabetes model projected life expectancy (LE), 
quality-adjusted LE (QALE) and total lifetime costs of complications in type 1 
diabetes cohorts with the characteristics of patients from the Diabetes Control 
and Complications Trial (DCCT). The following four cohorts (A-D) were created 
based on increased body weight under either conventional or intensive therapy: 
A) conventional glycaemic control in the subgroup with lowest weight-gain 
quartile after 6.5 years (HbA1c increased by 11% from baseline); B) conventional 
control in the highest weight-gain quartile (no change in HbA1c from baseline); 
C) intensive control in the lowest quartile of weight gain (with 16.1% decrease 
in HbA1c, but no increase in weight or associated BP, and improved lipid 
profile); D) intensive control in the highest quartile of weight gain (with 21% 
decrease in HbA1c, increased systolic BP of 6 mmHg, and worsened lipid profile). 
Data were derived from DCCT and other published sources.
RESULTS: Intensive control, even with weight gain, led to major improvements in 
LE and QALE, and reduction in costs of complications versus conventional 
therapy. Intensive therapy with no weight increase led to a higher LE (increased 
by 0.57 years) and higher QALE (increased by 0.28 years) and lower costs of 
complications (reduced by 523 dollars/patient), compared to intensive therapy 
with the highest quartile of weight gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about weight gain should not deter intensive insulin 
therapy. However, the value of improving glycaemic control without increasing 
body weight (and associated increased BP and worsening of lipid profile) has 
been confirmed.

Sevilla, Spain. miguel.ruiz.ext@juntadeandalucia.es

BACKGROUND: Because of the increase in life expectancy (LE) throughout the 
twentieth century, indicators providing information on quality of life and its 
distribution in distinct geographical areas are required. We describe LE and 
life expectancy without disability (LEWD) by age and sex and estimate the 
magnitude of inequalities between Andalusia and Spain.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Mortality data from the Natural Population Movement, the 
Survey of Disabilities, Deficiencies and Health Status, and the populations of 
the National Institute of Statistics for Andalusia and Spain in 1999 were used. 
Abbreviated life tables were constructed and were used to calculate LEWD through 
Sullivan's method. LE and LEWD by age and sex were obtained for Andalusia and 
Spain.
RESULTS: LE was lower in Andalusia than in Spain in all age groups and in both 
sexes. At birth, LE was 73.9 years for men and was 80.9 years for women in 
Andalusia and was 75.0 years and 82.1 years in Spain respectively. Inequalities 
between Andalusia and Spain in LEWD were greater in all age groups both in men 
and in women: at birth LEWD was 66.0 years and 69.0 years for men and women in 
Andalusia and was 68.3 years and 72.0 years in Spain.
CONCLUSIONS: Longevity and quality of life are lower in Andalusia than the mean 
for Spain, especially in elderly women.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden of disease due to vaccinable diseases and the 
relative importance of these diseases in the health of the Spanish population 
aged less than 15 years old.
METHODS: Disease burden was measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
DALYs were computed by adding years of life lost (YLL) to years lived with 
disability (YLD). The DALYs of the Spanish population aged less than 15 years 
old were estimated for 1999 and were stratified by diseases according to the 
classification system of the Global Burden of Disease (adapted to the aim of the 
study), age group and gender. Diseases included in the childhood vaccination 
schedule, varicella, and pneumococcal disease were targeted for this study. The 
sources used were: the national mortality register to compute YLL, the 
Epidemiologic Surveillance National Network, hospital discharge data (CMBD) and 
the scientific literature to compute YLD due to vaccinable diseases, and World 
Health Organization estimates (Euro-A) or, when these were lacking, morbidity 
hospital data (Hospital Morbidity Survey) to compute the YLD due to 
non-vaccinable diseases.
RESULTS: The burden of disease due to vaccinable diseases was 1.2% of global 
DALYS (the overall DALYs rate was 46,57/1,000 habitants): excluding 
meningococcal disease (0.5% to 3.3%), diseases included in the vaccination 
schedule represented 0.00% to 0.03%, depending on age groups, except 
meningococcal infection (between 0.5% and 3.3%). Pneumococcal meningitis 
represented 0.06% to 0.65% and varicella 0.00% to 0.15%, also depending on age 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease burden due to vaccinable diseases is a good indicator of 
the health of the young population in Spain. This measure summarizes and 
combines information on mortality, morbidity and disability caused by diseases. 
The DALYs attributable to diseases included in the vaccination schedule 
demonstrate that immunization programs have achieved their goals.

The Sun determines human longevity: teratogenic effects of chaotic solar 
radiation.

An association between fertility and longevity has been known for many years, 
and considerable research has been focused on the mechanisms of ageing that 
ultimately determine longevity, which has remained essentially unchanged despite 
a near doubling of human life expectancy in the past 200 years. In this paper, 
the authors present evidence that the Sun determines the limits of longevity for 
the longest-living complex organisms. The Sun is a dynamical system and although 
solar cycles occur every 8-14 years (averaging approximately 11.1 years), the 
authors show that 28% of these cycles exhibit chaotic features and irregularly 
release up to 300% more ultraviolet radiation than usual. These chaotic solar 
cycles create an environment mutagenic to DNA that must be largely avoided in 
order to pass uncorrupted genes to the next generation. This requirement 
determines the limits of fertility, e.g., menarche and menopause in humans, and 
sets longevity to approximately 100 years.

BACKGROUND: The tachycardia detection interval (TDI) in implantable 
cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) is conventionally programmed according to the 
slowest documented ventricular tachycardia (VT), with a safety margin of 30 to 
60 ms. With this margin, VTs above the TDI may occur. However, longer TDIs are 
associated with an increased risk of inappropriate therapy. We hypothesized that 
patients with slow VTs (<200 bpm) may benefit from a long TDI and a dual-chamber 
detection algorithm compared with a conventionally programmed single-chamber 
ICD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with VTs <200 bpm were implanted with a 
dual-chamber ICD that was randomly programmed to a dual-chamber algorithm and a 
TDI of > or =469 ms or to a single-chamber algorithm with a TDI 30 to 60 ms 
above the slowest documented VT cycle length and the enhancement criteria of 
cycle length variation and acceleration. The primary combined end point was the 
number of all inappropriate therapies, VTs above the TDI, and VTs with 
significant therapy delay (>2 minutes). After 6 months, a crossover analysis was 
performed. Total follow-up was 1 year. One hundred two patients were included in 
the study. The programmed TDI was 500+/-36 ms during the dual-chamber phase and 
424+/-63 ms during the single-chamber phase. For the primary end point 
(inappropriate therapies, VTs above the TDI, or VTs with detection delay), a 
moderate superiority of the dual-chamber mode was found: Mann-Whitney 
estimator=0.6661; 95% CI, 0.5565 to 0.7758; P=0.0040.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual-chamber detection with a longer TDI improves VT detection and 
does not increase the rate of inappropriate therapies despite a considerable 
increase in tachycardia burden.

BACKGROUND: Cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) characteristics are rarely documented 
when comparing catheters in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrial flutter 
(AFL). Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the impact of CTI morphology and 
length on ablation procedures and (2) to compare the efficacy of an 8-mm-tip 
catheter with an irrigated cooled-tip RFA in the subgroup presumed to be more 
difficult to treat (with a long CTI, >35 mm).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Over a period of 17 months, 185 patients accepted the 
protocol and underwent an isthmogram in preparation for RFA. Groups were 
classified according to CTI length and CTI morphology. RFA was performed with an 
8-mm-tip catheter for patients with a short CTI, < or =35 mm (n=123), whereas 
randomization between an 8-mm-tip and a cooled-tip catheter applied to patients 
with a longer CTI, >35 mm (n=62). For long CTI, 32 patients were assigned to an 
8-mm catheter and 30 patients to the cooled-tip RFA ablation group. In this 
subset, RF application (18.2+/-17 versus 19+/-13 minutes) and x-ray exposure 
(20.8+/-18 versus 18+/-13 minutes) did not differ between the 8-mm-tip and the 
cooled-tip procedures. Number of applications (9.9+/-11 versus 18.6+/-15 
minutes; P<0.0001) and x-ray exposure (11.7+/-11 versus 19.5+/-16 minutes, 
P=0.0001) differed significantly between patients with short and long CTIs. 
Patients with short and straight CTIs required 3 times fewer RFA applications 
and shorter x-ray exposure compared with other CTI morphologies (pouch-like 
recesses and concave characteristics).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of RF applications required for a complete isthmus block 
in long CTIs is not influenced by the choice between an 8-mm or cooled-tip 
catheter. Procedure parameters, however, are significantly influenced by CTI 
length and morphology. Pouch-like recesses and concave characteristics account 
for much longer ablation times at all CTI lengths.

    Neurology. 2005 May 24;64(10):1821-2; author reply 1821-2.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest that dystonia is comorbid with affective 
disorders. This comorbidity could be a reaction to a chronic debilitating 
disorder or expression of a predisposing gene. The authors took advantage of the 
identification of a gene for dystonia, DYT1, to test these alternative 
explanations.
METHODS: The authors administered a standardized psychiatric interview to 
members of families with an identified DYT1 mutation. The authors classified 
family members into three groups: mutation carriers with dystonia (manifesting 
carriers; n = 96), mutation carriers without dystonia (non-manifesting carriers; 
n = 60), and noncarriers (n = 65).
RESULTS: The risk for recurrent major depressive disorder was increased in both 
non-manifesting carriers (RR = 4.95, CI = 1.72 to 14.29) and manifesting 
carriers (RR = 3.62, CI = 1.00 to 10.53) compared with noncarriers. Mutation 
carriers also had earlier age at onset of recurrent major depressive disorder 
than noncarriers. The severity of motor signs was not associated with the 
likelihood of recurrent depression. Mutation carriers did not have an increased 
risk for other affective disorders, such as single major depression or bipolar 
disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset recurrent major depression is associated with the DYT1 
GAG mutation and this association is independent of motor manifestations of 
dystonia. These findings suggest that early-onset recurrent depression is a 
clinical expression of the DYT1 gene mutation.

Predictive value of sensory and cognitive evoked potentials for awakening from 
coma.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prognostic role of late auditory (N100) and 
cognitive evoked potentials (MMN) for awakening in a cohort of comatose patients 
categorized by etiology.
METHODS: The authors prospectively studied a series of 346 comatose patients. 
Coma was caused by stroke (n = 125), trauma (n = 96), anoxia (n = 64), 
complications of neurosurgery (n = 54), and encephalitis (n = 7). Patients were 
followed for 12 months and classified as awake or unawake. Univariate and 
multivariate analyses were performed using regression logistic and Cox models.
RESULTS: Pupillary light reflex, N100, middle-latency auditory evoked 
potentials, age, and etiology were the most discriminating factors for 
awakening. Statistical analysis showed that pupillary reflex was the strongest 
prognostic variable for awakening (estimated probability 79.7%). The estimated 
probability of awakening rose to 87% when N100 was present and to 89.9% when 
middle-latency evoked potentials (MLAEPs) were present. It was 13.7% when 
pupillary reflex was absent in anoxic patients. When MMN was present, 88.6% of 
patients awakened. No patient in whom MMN was present became permanently 
vegetative.
CONCLUSION: Pupillary reflex is the strongest prognostic variable, followed by 
N100 and MLAEPs allowing a reliable model for awakening. The presence of MMN is 
a predictor of awakening and precludes comatose patients from moving to a 
permanent vegetative state. Evaluation of primary sensory cortex and 
higher-order processes by middle-latency-, late, and cognitive evoked potentials 
should be performed in the prognosis for awakening in comatose patients.

Prevalence of spinal cord injury in Australia.

O'Connor PJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Kingswood, South Australia, Australia.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study, based on cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) that 
occurred between 1986 and 1997 (n=2959).
OBJECTIVES: To estimate prevalence historically, currently and into the future.
SETTING: Australia.
METHODS: Prevalence was estimated on the basis of (1) historical data concerning 
survival and the relationship between the incidence of fatalities and SCI, (2) 
information on SCI incidence and survival 1986-1997, and (3) forecasts of 
incidence and population growth from 1997 to 2021 and consideration of survival.
RESULTS: It was estimated that the prevalence of SCI in Australia was in the 
range 8096-9614 cases by 1985. By 1997, this had increased to nearly 10,000 and 
the prevalence rate was more than 681 per million of population. By 2021, this 
could increase to nearly 12,000 if age-specific SCI incidence rates continued at 
average values evident over the period 1986-1997 and national population 
projections applied. In addition, there would be more elderly SCI cases due to 
the ageing of the national population. The prevalent population could be reduced 
to less than 7000 if the incidence rate was reduced by -3% p.a.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SCI in Australia has increased and it will 
continue to increase unless measures are taken to control incidence. The case 
mix will change due to the ageing of the population, and treatment services will 
need to be prepared for a larger and more elderly prevalent population. It was 
suggested that consideration should be given to a national health and welfare 
goal to reduce the SCI incidence rate by -3% p.a., focusing in particular on the 
prevention of transport crashes and falls.

Experimental models may help elucidate aspects of uveal melanoma, such as the 
histogenesis, etiology and natural history, that are not yet fully understood. 
Moreover, the development of experimental models allows testing of new 
diagnostic methods and treatments to improve the life expectancy and quality of 
life of affected patients. The author reviews the development of animal models 
of uveal melanoma and research with animal models examining primary and 
metastatic uveal melanoma as well as treatments for these tumours and ways to 
prevent metastasis.

Sir2-independent life span extension by calorie restriction in yeast.

USA.

Comment in
    PLoS Biol. 2:e308.

Calorie restriction slows aging and increases life span in many organisms. In 
yeast, a mechanistic explanation has been proposed whereby calorie restriction 
slows aging by activating Sir2. Here we report the identification of a 
Sir2-independent pathway responsible for a majority of the longevity benefit 
associated with calorie restriction. Deletion of FOB1 and overexpression of SIR2 
have been previously found to increase life span by reducing the levels of toxic 
rDNA circles in aged mother cells. We find that combining calorie restriction 
with either of these genetic interventions dramatically enhances longevity, 
resulting in the longest-lived yeast strain reported thus far. Further, calorie 
restriction results in a greater life span extension in cells lacking both Sir2 
and Fob1 than in cells where Sir2 is present. These findings indicate that Sir2 
and calorie restriction act in parallel pathways to promote longevity in yeast 
and, perhaps, higher eukaryotes.

Survival time, lifespan, and quality of life in dogs with idiopathic Fanconi 
syndrome.

Author information:
(1)New England Primate Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Division of 
Comparative Pathology, One Pine Hill Dr, PO Box 9102, Southborough, MA 01772, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival time of dogs with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome.
DESIGN: Case series.
ANIMALS: 60 dogs with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome.
PROCEDURE: Data were collected by means of questionnaires distributed to owners 
and veterinarians of dogs with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome and by examination of 
medical records when accessible. Questionnaires and records were reviewed for 
criteria used in diagnosis, treatments administered, survival time, and 
subjective owner perceptions regarding their dogs' general condition.
RESULTS: 58 of the dogs were Basenjis. Fifty-seven dogs (95%) were reportedly 
managed by use of a single therapeutic regimen. Median survival time after 
diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome was 5.25 years; median estimated lifespan was 
calculated to be between 11.3 and 12.1 years. Owners of 28 of 29 (97%) dogs 
still alive at the time of the study subjectively assessed their dogs' general 
condition as good to excellent. Seizures or other neurologic dysfunction was 
reported for 11 dogs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that expected lifespan for 
dogs with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome was not substantially reduced, compared 
with expected lifespan for unaffected dogs, and that affected dogs generally had 
a good to excellent quality of life, as subjectively assessed by their owners. 
What effect the treatment regimen had on survival time or lifespan could not be 
determined, given the small number of dogs managed with other methods. The high 
percentage of dogs with neurologic abnormalities was a concern, but whether this 
was related to Fanconi syndrome or represented a breed-related predisposition to 
neurologic disease could not be determined.

Netherlands.

Our aim was to define the minimum set of patient-reported outcome measures which 
are required to assess health status after total hip replacement (THR). In 114 
patients, we compared the pre-operative characteristics and sensitivity to 
change of the Oxford hip score (OHS), the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), the SF-36, the SF-12 (derived from 
the SF-36), and the Euroqol questionnaire (EQ-5D). At one year after operation, 
very large effect sizes were found for the disease-specific measures, the 
physical domains of the SF-12, SF-36 and the EQ-5Dindex (1.3 to 3.0). Patients 
in Charnley class A showed more change in the OHS, WOMAC pain and function, the 
physical domains of the SF-36 and the EQ-5Dvas (p < 0.05) compared with those in 
the Charnley B and C group. In this group, the effect size for the OHS more than 
doubled the effect sizes of WOMAC pain and physical function. We found high 
correlations and correlations of change between the OHS, the WOMAC, the physical 
domains of the SF-12 and the SF-36 and EQ-5Dindex. The SF-36 and EQ-5D scores at 
one year after operation approached those of the general population. 
Furthermore, we found a binomial distribution of the pre-operative EQ-5Dindex 
score and a pre-operative discrepancy and post-operative agreement between the 
EQ-5Dvas and EQ-5Dindex. We recommend the use of the OHS and SF-12 in the 
assessment of THR. The SF-36 may be used in circumstances when smaller changes 
in health status are investigated, for example in the follow-up of THR. The 
EQ-5D is useful in situations in which utility values are needed in order to 
calculate cost-effectiveness or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), such as in 
the assessment of new techniques in THR.

Ready-to-eat (RTE) meats (low-fat pastrami, Strassburg beef, export sausage, and 
Cajun beef) were pressure treated at 600 MPa, 20 degrees C, for 180 s to 
evaluate the feasibility of using high-pressure processing (HPP) for the safe 
shelf-life extension of these products. After processing, samples were stored at 
4 degrees C for 98 days during which time microbiological enumeration and 
enrichments were performed. Additionally, sensory analyses were undertaken to 
determine consumer acceptability and purchase intent over the duration of 
storage. Counts of aerobic and anaerobic mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria, 
Listeria spp., staphylococci, Brochothrix thermosphacta, coliforms, and yeasts 
and molds revealed that there were undetectable or low levels for all types of 
microorganisms throughout storage. Comparison of consumer hedonic ratings for
