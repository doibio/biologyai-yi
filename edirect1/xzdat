Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a frequent complication of various cancers 
and often leads to a poor quality of life, prognosis, and life expectancy, and 
its management remains palliative. New approaches that can effectively treat MPE 
are highly desirable. Here, we show that methotrexate (MTX)-packaging tumor 
cell-derived microparticles (MTX-MP) act as an effective immunotherapeutic agent 
to treat patients with MPE by mobilizing and activating neutrophils. We find 
that MTX-MP perfusion via a pleural catheter elicits the recruitment of 
neutrophils in patients through macrophage-released CXCL1 and CXCL2. By 
performing ex vivo experiments, we find that the recruited neutrophils are 
activated and release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular 
trap (NET) to kill tumor cells. Neutrophil-released NETs were also able to seal 
off the damaged endothelium, facilitating MPE resolution in vitro and in 
tumor-bearing mice. These findings reveal the potential for use of cell-derived 
materials to package drugs as an immunotherapeutic agent against MPE.

Studies on geographic inequalities in life expectancy in the United States have 
exclusively focused on single-level analyses of aggregated data at state or 
county level. This study develops a multilevel perspective to understanding 
variation in life expectancy by simultaneously modeling the geographic variation 
at the levels of census tracts (CTs), counties, and states. We analyzed data 
from 65,662 CTs, nested within 3,020 counties and 48 states (plus District of 
Columbia). The dependent variable was age-specific life expectancy observed in 
each of the CTs. We also considered the following CT-level socioeconomic and 
demographic characteristics as independent variables: population density; 
proportions of population who are black, who are single parents, who are below 
the federal poverty line, and who are aged 25 or older who have a bachelor's 
degree or higher; and median household income. Of the total geographic variation 
in life expectancy at birth, 70.4% of the variation was attributed to CTs, 
followed by 19.0% for states and 10.7% for counties. The relative importance of 
CTs was greater for life expectancy at older ages (70.4 to 96.8%). The CT-level 
independent variables explained 5 to 76.6% of between-state variation, 11.1 to 
58.6% of between-county variation, and 0.7 to 44.9% of between-CT variation in 
life expectancy across different age groups. Our findings indicate that 
population inequalities in longevity in the United States are primarily a local 
phenomenon. There is a need for greater precision and targeting of local 
geographies in public policy discourse aimed at reducing health inequalities in 
the United States.

and nutrition perspective.

In an international comparison of recent mortality statistics among G7 
countries, Japan had the longest average life expectancy, primarily due to 
remarkably low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer 
(particularly breast and prostate). As recently as the 1960s, life expectancy in 
Japan was the shortest among the G7 countries, owing to relatively high 
mortality from cerebrovascular disease-particularly intracerebral hemorrhage-and 
stomach cancer. Mortality rates for these diseases subsequently decreased 
significantly while the already low rates for ischemic heart disease and cancer 
also decreased, resulting in Japanese life expectancy becoming the longest. The 
low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer are thought to 
reflect the low prevalence of obesity in Japan; low intake of red meat, 
specifically saturated fatty acids; and high intakes of fish, specifically n-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, plant foods such as soybeans, and 
nonsugar-sweetened beverages such as green tea. The decreasing mortality rates 
from cerebrovascular disease are thought to reflect the increases in animal 
foods, milk, and dairy products and consequently in saturated fatty acids and 
calcium, together with a decrease in salt intake which may have led to a 
decrease in blood pressure. This decrease in salt and highly salted foods also 
seems to account for the decrease in stomach cancer. The typical Japanese diet 
as characterized by plant food and fish as well as modest Westernized diet such 
as meat, milk and dairy products might be associated with longevity in Japan.

Selective breeding of the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) rigidly retains 
desirable features, and could inadvertently fix disease-causing variants within 
a breed. We combine phenotypic data from > 72,000 dogs with a large genotypic 
dataset to search for genes associated with cancer mortality and longevity in 
pedigree dog breeds. We validated previous findings that breeds with higher 
average body weight have higher cancer mortality rates and lower life 
expectancy. We identified a significant positive correlation between life span 
and cancer mortality residuals corrected for body weight, implying that 
long-lived breeds die more frequently from cancer compared to short-lived 
breeds. We replicated a number of known genetic associations with body weight 
(IGF1, GHR, CD36, SMAD2 and IGF2BP2). Subsequently, we identified five genetic 
variants in known cancer-related genes (located within SIPA1, ADCY7 and ARNT2) 
that could be associated with cancer mortality residuals corrected for 
confounding factors. One putative genetic variant was marginally significantly 
associated with longevity residuals that had been corrected for the effects of 
body weight; this genetic variant is located within PRDX1, a peroxiredoxin that 
belongs to an emerging class of pro-longevity associated genes. This research 
should be considered as an exploratory analysis to uncover associations between 
genes and longevity/cancer mortality.

BACKGROUND: Health state utility values (HSUVs) identified from utility 
elicitation studies are widely used in pharmacoeconomic evaluations for chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC) and are particularly instrumental in health technology 
assessment (HTA) evaluations such as those from the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify HSUVs used in cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs) for CHC in Europe and to evaluate the impact of HSUV selection 
on cost-effectiveness results in terms of the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (ICER).
METHODS: A systematic search of pharmacoeconomic evaluations for CHC was updated 
in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for the periods 2012-2017 and 2017-2020. 
Data on health states, HSUVs, and utility elicitation studies were extracted. 
The difference in HSUVs of the same health state in different CUAs, and the 
difference between HSUVs of one health state and of the interlink health state 
in the same CUAs, were calculated. A quality assessment was performed to 
evaluate the selection of HSUVs in CUAs. Sets of HSUVs identified were used in a 
reconstructed CUA model to assess the impact on the ICER.
RESULTS: Twenty-six CUAs conducted in European countries and referring to 17 
utility elicitation studies were included. The difference in HSUVs of the same 
health state in different CUAs ranged from 0.021 (liver transplant) to 0.468 
(decompensated cirrhosis). The difference between HSUVs of one health state and 
of the interlink health state of the next disease severity level was calculated 
between the health states of F0-F1/mild and F2-F3/moderate (n = 11, 
0.040-0.110), F2-F3/moderate and F4/compensated cirrhosis (n = 18, 0.027-0.130), 
compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis (n = 22, 0.020-0.100), 
decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 24, 0.000-0.200), 
hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplant in the first year (n = 17, - 0.329 
to 0.170) and liver transplant in the first and subsequent years (n = 17, 
- 0.340 to 0.000). The utility elicitation study selected by most CUAs (n = 11) 
was recommended as the source of HSUVs, at least for the CUAs conducted in the 
UK, based on the results of quality assessment. Seven sets of HSUVs were 
generated to fit the reconstructed model and changed the results of the 
incremental analysis from being cost effective to not being cost effective (ICER 
ranging from £2460 to £24,954 per QALY gained), and to being dominated in the UK 
setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The CUAs for CHC were found to apply to various HSUVs from 
different utility elicitation studies in the same health state. This variability 
in HSUVs has the potential to significantly affect ICER and ICER-based 
reimbursement decisions. A rigorous selection of HSUVs in CUAs to inform 
healthcare resource allocation is suggested for future studies of CUAs and for 
guideline development.

While TKI are the preferred first-line treatment for chronic phase (CP) CML, 
alloHCT remains an important consideration. The aim is to estimate residual life 
expectancy (RLE) for patients initially diagnosed with CP CML based on timing of 
alloHCT or continuation of TKI in various settings: CP1 CML, CP2 + [after 
transformation to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP)], AP, or BP. 
Non-transplant cohort included single-institution patients initiating TKI and 
switched TKI due to failure. CIBMTR transplant cohort included CML patients who 
underwent HLA sibling matched (MRD) or unrelated donor (MUD) alloHCT. AlloHCT 
appeared to shorten survival in CP1 CML with overall mortality hazard ratio (HR) 
for alloHCT of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-4.9; p = .02). In BP CML, there was a trend 
toward higher survival with alloHCT; HR = 0.7 (0.5-1.1; p = .099). AlloHCT in 
CP2 + [HR = 2.0 (0.8-4.9), p = .13] and AP [HR = 1.1 (0.6-2.1); p = .80] is less 
clear and should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

care consults on clarifying code status preferences and hospice referrals in 
Spanish-speaking patients.

BACKGROUND: Hispanics often have disparities at the end of life. They are more 
likely to die full code and less likely to have discussions regarding prognosis 
and do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), despite studies showing 
Hispanic values comfort over the extension of life. Barriers to patient-centered 
care include language,socioeconomic status and health literacy.
CONTEXT: We evaluated the impact of palliative care (PC) consults on the change 
of code status and hospice referrals, comparing seriously ill Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic white patients.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of all white and Hispanic patients referred 
to the PC service of a county hospital from 2006 to 2012. We evaluated 
ethnicity, language, code status at admission and after PC consult, and hospice 
discharge. Chi-squared tests were used to analyze characteristics among three 
groups: non-Hispanic white, English-speaking Hispanic, and Spanish-speaking 
Hispanic patients.
RESULTS: Of 925 patients, 511 (55%) were non-Hispanic white, 208 (23%) were 
English-speaking Hispanic, and 206 (22%) were Spanish-speaking Hispanic 
patients. On admission, there was no statistically significant difference in 
code status among the three groups (57%, 64%, and 59% were full code, 
respectively, p = 0.5). After PC consults, Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients 
were more likely to change their code status to DNR/DNI when compared with 
non-Hispanic white and English-speaking Hispanic patients (44% vs. 32% vs. 28%, 
p = 0.05). Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients were more likely to be discharged 
to hospice when compared with English-speaking Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites 
(33%, 29%, and 23%, respectively, p = 0.04).
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients were more likely to 
change from full code to DNR/DNI compared with non-Hispanic white and 
English-speaking Hispanic patients, despite similar code status preferences on 
admission. They were also more likely to be discharged to hospice. PC consults 
may play an important role in helping patients to align their care with their 
values and may prevent unwanted aggressive interventions at the end of life.

BACKGROUND: Patients older than 80 years of age form an increasing proportion of 
the patient population undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA). With 
increasing life expectancy and the success of TJA, orthopaedic surgeons are more 
likely to operate on patients older than 80 years than ever before. Given that 
most other studies focus on younger populations, only evaluate primary TJA, or 
limit patient populations to institutional or regional data, we felt a 
large-database, nationwide analysis of this demographic cohort was warranted, 
and we wished to consider both primary and revision TJA.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this study, we sought to investigate the risk factors for 
surgical site infections (SSIs) at 90 days and periprosthetic joint infections 
(PJIs) at 2 years after surgery in patients aged 80 years and older undergoing 
(1) primary and (2) revision lower extremity TJA.
METHODS: All patients aged 80 years or older who underwent primary or revision 
TJA between 2005 and 2014 were identified using the Medicare Analytical Files of 
the PearlDiver Supercomputer using ICD-9 codes. This database is unique in that 
it is one of the largest nationwide databases, and so it provides a large enough 
sample size of patients 80 years or older. Additionally, this database provides 
comprehensive and longitudinal patient data tracking, and a low error rate. Our 
final cohort consisted of 503,241 patients (TKA: n = 275,717; THA: n = 162,489; 
revision TKA: n = 28,779; revision THA: n = 36,256). Multivariate logistic 
regression models were constructed to evaluate the association of risk factors 
on the incidences of 90-day SSI and 2-year PJI. Variables such as sex, diabetes, 
BMI, and congestive heart failure, were included in the multivariate regression 
models. Several high-risk comorbidities as identified by the Charlson and 
Elixhauser comorbidity indices were selected to construct the models. We 
performed a Bonferroni-adjusted correction to account for the fact that multiple 
statistical comparisons were made, with a p value < 0.002 being considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: For primary TKA patients, an increased risk of 90-day SSIs was 
associated with male sex (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.25 to 1.52]; p < 0.001), BMI greater 
than 25 k/m (p < 0.001), and other comorbidities. For primary THA patients, an 
increased risk of 90-day SSIs was associated with patients with obesity (BMI 
30-39 kg/m; OR 1.91 [95% CI 1.60 to 2.26]; p < 0.001) and those with morbid 
obesity (BMI 40-70 kg/m; OR 2.58 [95% CI 1.95 to 3.36]; p < 0.001). For revision 
TKA patients, an increased risk of SSI was associated with iron-deficiency 
anemia (OR 1.82 [95% CI 1.37 to 2.28]; p < 0.001). For revision THA patients, 
electrolyte imbalance (OR 1.48 [95% CI 1.23 to 1.79]; p < 0.001) and 
iron-deficiency anemia (OR 1.63 [95% CI 1.35 to 1.99]; p < 0.001) were 
associated with an increased risk of 90-day SSI. Similar associations were noted 
for PJI in each cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that in this population, male sex, obesity, 
hypertension, iron-deficiency anemia, among other high-risk comorbidities are 
associated with a higher risk of SSIs and PJIs. Based on these findings, 
orthopaedic surgeons should actively engage in comanagement strategies with 
internists and other specialists to address modifiable risk factors through 
practices such as weight management programs, blood pressure reduction, and 
electrolyte balancing. Furthermore, this data should encourage healthcare 
systems and policy makers to recognize that this patient demographic is at 
increased risks for PJI or SSI, and these risks must be considered when 
negotiating payment bundles.

OBJECTIVES: At any point in time, a person's lifetime health is the number of 
healthy life years they are expected to experience during their lifetime. In 
this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, Health Adjusted Age at 
Death (HAAD), that facilitates comparison of lifetime health for individuals at 
the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of 
which patient groups are worse off. A method for estimating HAAD is presented, 
and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to 
several criteria of "worse off" as a proof of concept.
METHODS: For individuals with specific conditions HAAD consists of two 
components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after 
disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid 
leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries 
(Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data from 2017 for 
all countries and for all diseases were obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on 
four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to have 
HAAD<20 (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of HAAD for affected individuals 
(Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average HAAD (aHAAD) across all affected 
individuals.
RESULTS: Even in settings where aHAAD is similar for two conditions, other 
measures may vary. One example is AML (aHAAD = 59.3, T20 = 2.0%, Q3-Q1 = 14.8) 
and ALL (58.4, T20 = 4.6%, Q3-Q1 = 21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as 
epilepsy, are associated with more lifetime health in high-income settings (Q1 
in Japan = 59.2) than in low-income settings (Q1 in Ethiopia = 26.3).
CONCLUSION: Using HAAD we may estimate the distribution of lifetime health of 
all individuals in a population, and this distribution can be incorporated as an 
equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.

Environmental DNA and RNA as Records of Human Exposome, Including Biotic/Abiotic 
Exposures and Its Implications in the Assessment of the Role of Environment in 
Chronic Diseases.

Most of environment-related diseases often result from multiple exposures of 
abiotic and/or biotic stressors across various life stages. The application of 
environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) to advance ecological understanding has been 
very successfully used. However, the eminent extension of eDNA/eRNA-based 
approaches to estimate human exposure to biotic and/or abiotic environmental 
stressors to understand the environmental causes of chronic diseases has yet to 
start. Here, we introduce the potential of eDNA/eRNA for bio-monitoring of human 
exposome and health effects in the real environmental or occupational settings. 
This review is the first of its kind to discuss how eDNA/eRNA-based approaches 
can be applied for assessing the human exposome. eDNA-based exposome assessment 
is expected to rely on our ability to capture the genome- and epigenome-wide 
signatures left behind by individuals in the indoor and outdoor physical spaces 
through shedding, excreting, etc. Records of eDNA/eRNA exposome may reflect the 
early appearance, persistence, and presence of biotic and/or 
abiotic-exposure-mediated modifications in these nucleic acid molecules. 
Functional genome- and epigenome-wide mapping of eDNA offer great promise to 
help elucidate the human exposome. Assessment of longitudinal exposure to 
physical, biological, and chemical agents present in the environment through 
eDNA/eRNA may enable the building of an integrative causal dynamic stochastic 
model to estimate environmental causes of human health deficits. This model is 
expected to incorporate key biological pathways and gene networks linking 
individuals, their geographic locations, and random multi-hits of environmental 
factors. Development and validation of monitoring of eDNA/eRNA exposome should 
seriously be considered to introduce into safety and risk assessment and as 
surrogates of chronic exposure to environmental stressors. Here we highlight 
that eDNA/eRNA reflecting longitudinal exposure of both biotic and abiotic 
environmental stressors may serve as records of human exposome and discuss its 
application as molecular tools for understanding the toxicogenomics basis of 
environment-related health deficits.

OBJECTIVE: To acquire evidence-based knowledge in temporal and spatial patterns 
of microglia/macrophages changes to facilitate finding proper intervention time 
for functional restoration after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).
SETTING: Sina Trauma and Surgery Research Center, Tehran University of Medical 
Sciences, Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE via Ovid SP with no temporal and 
linguistic restrictions. Besides, hand-search was performed in the 
bibliographies of relevant studies. The experimental non-interventional and 
non-transgenic animal studies confined to the rat species which assess the 
pathological change of microglia /macrophages at the specified time were 
included.
RESULTS: We found 15,315 non-duplicate studies. Screening through title and 
abstract narrowed down to 607 relevant articles, 31 of them were selected based 
on the inclusion criteria. The reactivity of the microglia/macrophages initiates 
in early hours PI in contusion, compression and transection models. Cells 
activity reached a maximum within 48 h to 28 days in compression, 7 days in 
contusion and between 4 and 60 days in transection models. Inflammatory response 
occurred at the epicenter, in or near the lesion site in both gray and white 
matter in all three injury models with a maximum extension of one centimeter 
caudal and rostral to the epicenter in the gray matter in contusion and 
transection models.
CONCLUSION: This study was designed to study spatial-temporal changes in the 
activation of microglia/macrophages overtime after TSCI. We were able to 
demonstrate time-dependent cell morphological changes after TSCI. The peak times 
of cell reactivity and the areas where the cells responded to the injury were 
determined.

INTRODUCTION: Underuse of high-value clinical practices and overuse of low-value 
practices are major sources of inefficiencies in modern healthcare systems. 
Injuries are second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of acute care costs 
but data on the economic impact of clinical practices for injury admissions are 
lacking. This study aims to summarise evidence on the economic value of 
intrahospital clinical practices for injury care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a systematic review to identify research 
articles in economic evaluation of intrahospital clinical practices in acute 
injury care. We will search MEDLINE and databases such as Embase, Web of 
Science, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS and CINAHL 
for randomised or non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies 
using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary. We will consider the 
following outcomes relative to economic evaluations: incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, incremental cost-utility ratio, incremental net health 
benefit, incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) and incremental cost-benefit 
ratio. Pairs of independent reviewers will evaluate studies that meet 
eligibility criteria and extract data from included articles using an electronic 
data extraction form. All outcomes will be converted into iNMB. We will report 
iNMB for practices classified by type of practice (hospitalisation, 
consultation, diagnostic, therapeutic-surgical, therapeutic-drugs, 
therapeutic-other). Results obtained with a ceiling ratio of $50 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained for identified clinical practices will be 
summarised by charting forest plots. In line with Cochrane recommendations for 
systematic reviews of economic evaluations, meta-analyses will not be conducted.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required as original data will 
not be collected. This study will summarise existing evidence on the economic 
value of clinical practices in injury care. Results will be used to advance 
knowledge on value-based care for injury admissions and will be disseminated 
through a peer-reviewed article, international scientific meetings and clinical 
and healthcare quality associations.

Understanding variability in growth patterns of marine mammals provides insights 
into the health of individuals and status of populations. Body growth of gray 
whales (Eschrichtius robustus) has been described for particular life stages, 
but has not been quantified across all ages. We derived a comprehensive growth 
equation for gray whales by fitting a two-phased growth model to age-specific 
length data of eastern North Pacific gray whales that were captured, stranded, 
or harvested between 1926 and 1997. To predict mass-at-age, we used the 
allometric relationship between mass and length. We found that on average (± 
SD), calves were 4.6 ± 0.043 m and 972 ± 26 kg at birth, and reached 8.5 ± 0.095 
m and 6,019 ± 196 kg by the end of their first year of life (n = 118). Thus, 
calves almost double (2×) in length and octuple (8×) in mass while nursing, and 
are effectively about two-thirds of their asymptotic adult length and one-third 
of their maximum mass when weaned. The large sample of aged individuals (n = 
730) indicates that gray whales live up to ~48 years and have a life expectancy 
of < 30 years. Adult females attain a mean (± SD) asymptotic size of 13.1 ± 
0.048 m and 20,758 ± 222 kg, while the smaller males average 12.6 ± 0.048 m and 
19,938 ± 222 kg at ~40 years of age. Females are thereby ~4% longer and heavier 
than males. These age-specific estimates of body size can be used to estimate 
food requirements and assess nutritional status of individuals.

Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) are promising molecules to prevent 
age-related diseases as they activate pathways driven by a true caloric 
restriction. Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is considered a bona fide CRM since it 
depletes acetyl-CoA pools by acting as a competitive inhibitor of ATP citrate 
lyase (ACLY), ultimately repressing protein acetylation and promoting autophagy. 
Importantly, it can reduce inflammation and tumour development. In order to 
identify phenotypically relevant new HCA targets we have investigated HCA 
effects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where ACLY is lacking. Strikingly, the drug 
revealed a powerful anti-aging effect, another property proposed to mark bona 
fide CRMs. Chronological life span (CLS) extension but also resistance to acetic 
acid of HCA treated cells were associated to repression of cell apoptosis and 
necrosis. HCA also largely prevented cell deaths caused by a severe oxidative 
stress. The molecule could act widely by negatively modulating cell metabolism, 
similarly to citrate. Indeed, it inhibited both growth reactivation and the 
oxygen consumption rate of yeast cells in stationary phase. Genetic analyses on 
yeast CLS mutants indicated that part of the HCA effects can be sensed by Sch9 
and Ras2, two conserved key regulators of nutritional and stress signal pathways 
of primary importance. Our data together with published biochemical analyses 
indicate that HCA may act with multiple mechanisms together with ACLY repression 
and allowed us to propose an integrated mechanistic model as a basis for future 
investigations.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity and life 
expectancy of quilombola elders.
METHOD: A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study involving fifty-nine 
older adults from the quilombola community of Curiaú, Macapá-Amapá. A 
sociodemographic form was used to characterize the sample, and Lawton's and 
Herth's Hope Scales were used to measuring functional capacity and life 
expectancy, respectively. In the relationship study, the Spearman correlation 
test was applied.
RESULTS: Elderly males aged 60-69 years (52.5%) and married (35.6%) prevailed. 
Functional capacity had a mean score of 22.4 (± 4.6) and a life expectancy of 
41.5 (± 5.1), the correlation between the scale scores was positive and 
significant (R = 0.475; p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: From the results concluded, when related levels of independence and 
life expectancy among themselves were significantly associated with being 
functionally independent elderly and having a better life expectancy.

Background: HIV infection is an increasingly complex chronic disease associated 
with numerous medical, psychological, and social problems. The life expectancy 
of affected patients has increased considerably. Medical apps could also play a 
role in prevention and management of comorbid conditions in the HIV-infected 
population. Objectives: To determine the usefulness of an app designed 
specifically for HIV-infected patients aged 60 years or older and to assess 
changes in patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and quality of health 
care. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted, including 100 patients 
(50 per group): (1) an experimental group comprising patients using the app + 
routine medical care (app group) and (2) with routine medical care (control 
group). The usability of the app and patient satisfaction were evaluated in the 
app group at week 48. Quality of life, adherence to treatment, and clinical 
parameters were compared between both groups at 48 weeks, as well as the number 
of face-to-face visits. Results: We found that 52.2% and 73.8% of patients in 
the app group used the app at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Patients used the 
app for a mean of 23.7 (±2.84) days over the 48 weeks. The most visited screens 
were health counseling and medical records (24.8% and 22.2%, respectively). At 
week 48, 85.2% of patients thought that the app was useful and 91.4% would 
recommend the app to friends or relatives. The app was well valued by 
participants (4.79 [±0.21] of 5.00) and 64.6% thought that the app improved 
their health care.

The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is globally distributed with established 
coastal and open-ocean movement patterns in many portions of its range. While 
all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), 
variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been 
quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 
tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 
and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. 
Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density 
estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas 
platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant 
ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as 
across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. 
Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement 
rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile 
sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum 
rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, 
we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., 
shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 
2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future 
assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, 
on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may 
benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry 
and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the 
species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of 
the core habitats identified here.
