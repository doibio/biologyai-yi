hip extension torques acting on the pelvis, leading to hip extensor-induced 
thigh sagittal rotations rather than pelvic posterior tilt. During the 
double-stance phase, the lumbosacral extensors generated mechanical energy (0.35 
± 0.16 J/kg, 14 ± 4% of the sum of lumbosacral and lower-limb net joint work). 
During the single-stance phase, the sum of the net mechanical work by 
lumbosacral lateral flexors and front hip abductors was 0.35 ± 0.14 J/kg, which 
comprised 9 ± 3% of the sum of the net joint work. The results lead to the 
speculation of the importance of strengthening not only the leg extensors, but 
also the lumbopelvic extensors, lateral flexors, and hip abductors for block 
starts. Further training studies to verify this speculation will improve 
training strategies for the track and field block start performance.

Improvements in hygiene and health management have driven significant increases 
in human lifespan over the last 50 years. Frustratingly however, this extension 
of lifespan has not been matched by equivalent improvements in late-life health, 
not least due to the global pandemic in type-2 diabetes, obesity and 
cardiovascular disease, all ageing-associated conditions exacerbated and 
accelerated by widespread adoption of the high calorie Western diet (HCD). 
Recently, evidence has begun to emerge that parasitic worm infection might 
protect against such ageing-associated co-morbidities, as a serendipitous 
side-effect of their evolution of pro-survival, anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As 
a novel therapeutic strategy, we have therefore investigated the potential of 
ES-62, an anti-inflammatory secreted product of the filarial nematode 
Acanthocheilonema viteae, to improve healthspan (the period of life before 
diseases of ageing appear) by targeting the chronic inflammation that drives 
metabolic dysregulation underpinning ageing-induced ill-health. We administered 
ES-62 subcutaneously (at a dose of 1 μg/week) to C57BL/6J mice undergoing 
HCD-accelerated ageing throughout their lifespan, while subjecting the animals 
to analysis of 120 immunometabolic responses at various time-points. ES-62 
improved a number of inflammatory parameters, but markedly, a range of 
pathophysiological, metabolic and microbiome parameters of ageing were also 
successfully targeted. Notably, ES-62-mediated promotion of healthspan in male 
and female HCD-mice was associated with different mechanisms and reflecting 
this, machine learning modelling identified sex-specific signatures predictive 
of ES-62 action against HCD-accelerated ageing. Remarkably, ES-62 substantially 
increased the median survival of male HCD-mice. This was not the case with 
female animals and unexpectedly, this difference between the two sexes could not 
be explained in terms of suppression of the chronic inflammation driving ageing, 
as ES-62 tended to be more effective in reducing this in female mice. Rather, 
the difference appeared to be associated with ES-62's additional ability to 
preferentially promote a healthier gut-metabolic tissue axis in male animals.

outcomes?

BACKGROUND: Single-arm trials are currently an accepted study design to 
investigate the efficacy of novel therapies (NT) in non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer (NMIBC) unresponsive to intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) 
immunotherapy as randomized controlled trials are either unfeasible (comparator: 
early radical cystectomy; ERC), or unethical (comparator: placebo). To guide the 
design of such single-arm trials, expert groups published recommendations for 
clinically meaningful outcomes. The aim of this study was to quantitatively 
verify the appropriateness of these recommendations.
METHODS: We used a discrete event simulation framework in combination with a 
supercomputer to find the required efficacy at which a NT can compete with ERC 
when it comes to quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). In total, 24 different 
efficacy thresholds (including the recommendations) were investigated.
RESULTS: After ascertaining face validity with content experts, repeated 
verification, external validation, and calibration we considered our model 
valid. Both recommendations rarely showed an incremental benefit of the NT over 
ERC. In the most optimistic scenario, an increase in the IBCG recommendation by 
10% and an increase in the FDA/AUA recommendation by 5% would yield results at 
which a NT could compete with ERC from a QALE perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: This simulation study demonstrated that the current recommendations 
regarding clinically meaningful outcomes for single-arm trials evaluating the 
efficacy of NT in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may be too low. Based on our 
quantitative approach, we propose increasing these thresholds to at least 
45%-55% at 6 months and 35% at 18-24 months (complete response 
rates/recurrence-free survival) to promote the development of clinically truly 
meaningful NT.

NoxO1 Knockout Promotes Longevity in Mice.

According to the free radical theory of aging, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
have been proposed to be a major cause of aging for a long time. Meanwhile, it 
became clear that ROS have diverse functions in a healthy organism. They act as 
second messengers, and as transient inhibitors of phosphatases and others. In 
fact, their detrimental role is highly dependent on the context of their 
production. NADPH oxidases (Nox) have been discovered as a controllable source 
of ROS. NoxO1 enables constitutive ROS formation by Nox1 by acting as a 
constitutively active cytosolic subunit of the complex. We previously found that 
both Nox1 and NoxO1 were highly expressed in the colon, and that NoxO1-/- 
deficiency reduces colon health. We hypothesized that a healthy colon 
potentially contributes to longevity and NoxO1 deficiency would reduce lifetime, 
at least in mouse. In contrast, here we provide evidence that the knockout of 
NoxO1 results in an elongated life expectancy of mice. No better endothelial 
function, nor an improved expression of genes related to longevity, such as 
Sirt1, were found, and therefore may not serve as an explanation for a longer 
life in NoxO1 deficiency. Rather minor systemic differences, such as lower body 
weight occur. As a potential reason for longer life, we suggest better DNA 
repair capacity in NoxO1 deficient mice. Although final fatal DNA damage appears 
similar between wildtype and NoxO1 knockout animals, we identified less 
intermediate DNA damage in colon cells of NoxO1-/- mice, while the number of 
cells with intact DNA is elevated in NoxO1-/- colons. We conclude that NoxO1 
deficiency prolongs lifetime of mice, which correlates with less intermediate 
and potentially fixable DNA damage at least in colon cells.

BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread each year in developed 
countries, mainly due to increasing life expectancy. Among them, diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and essential hypertension (EH) are two of the most prevalent 
ones. Furthermore, they can be the onset of other chronic conditions such as 
kidney or obstructive pulmonary diseases. The need to comprehend the factors 
related to such complex diseases motivates the development of interpretative and 
visual analysis methods, such as classification trees, which not only provide 
predictive models for diagnosing patients, but can also help to discover new 
clinical insights.
RESULTS: In this paper, we analyzed healthy and chronic (diabetic, hypertensive) 
patients associated with the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada in Spain. Each 
patient was classified into a single health status according to clinical risk 
groups (CRGs). The CRGs characterize a patient through features such as age, 
gender, diagnosis codes, and drug codes. Based on these features and the CRGs, 
we have designed classification trees to determine the most discriminative 
decision features among different health statuses. In particular, we propose to 
make use of statistical data visualizations to guide the selection of features 
in each node when constructing a tree. We created several classification trees 
to distinguish among patients with different health statuses. We analyzed their 
performance in terms of classification accuracy, and drew clinical conclusions 
regarding the decision features considered in each tree. As expected, healthy 
patients and patients with a single chronic condition were better classified 
than patients with comorbidities. The constructed classification trees also show 
that the use of antipsychotics and the diagnosis of chronic airway obstruction 
are relevant for classifying patients with more than one chronic condition, in 
conjunction with the usual DM and/or EH diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a methodology for constructing classification trees in a 
visually guided manner. The approach allows clinicians to progressively select 
the decision features at each of the tree nodes. The process is guided by 
exploratory data analysis visualizations, which may provide new insights and 
unexpected clinical information.

BACKGROUND: Preventive home visits are suited for patients with reduced 
mobility, such as older people. Healthcare needs for older patients are expected 
to increase due to the extended life expectancy estimated in coming years. The 
implementation of low-cost, patient-centered methodologies may buffer this rise 
in health care costs without affecting the quality of service. In order to find 
the best home care model with less investment, this paper describes a study 
protocol comparing two models of home care for older people.
METHODS: We describe a quasi-experimental study that compares the outcome of two 
different home care models already implemented in two primary care centers in 
Badalona (Barcelona, Spain). The traditional model (control model) is integrated 
in the sense that is continuous, the same primary care center team looks after 
its assigned patients both at the center and in preventive home visits. The new 
functional home care model (study model), consisting of a highly trained team, 
is specifically designed to meet patient needs and give total attention to 
preventive home interventions. The study will start and end on the expected 
dates, June 2018 to October 2020, and include all patients over 65 years old 
already enrolled in the home care programs of the primary care centers selected. 
The primary endpoint assessed will be the difference in hospitalization days 
between patients included in both home care programs. Other variables regarding 
health status, quality of care and resource utilization will also be compared 
between the two models.
DISCUSSION: The study in progress will assess whether a functional and highly 
trained home care team will meet the ever-aging population needs in terms of 
cost and health outcomes better than a traditional, integrated one. Lessons 
learned from this pilot study will provide guidelines for a future model of home 
care based on the IHI Triple Aim: better care, better health, and lower costs.

BACKGROUND: The cost of treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), 
particularly recurrent disease, is high. In clinical trials, fidaxomicin has 
been associated with significantly lower recurrence rates and higher sustained 
cure rates versus vancomycin. The high acquisition cost of fidaxomicin has 
limited its acceptance into clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin 
in patients with CDI after failure of metronidazole in the Japanese healthcare 
setting.
METHODS: Clinical results from three phase III trials and inputs based on 
assumptions validated by clinical experts in Japan were used in a semi-Markov 
model with 1-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) and interpreted using willingness-to-pay thresholds of JPY 
5,000,000 (primary) and JPY 7,500,000 (secondary) per QALY gained in Japan. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Higher drug acquisition costs for fidaxomicin were partially offset by 
lower hospitalization costs driven by fewer recurrences, lower costs of 
complications, and fewer general practitioner visits versus vancomycin. The ICER 
for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin was estimated at JPY 5,715,183 per QALY 
gained. Sensitivity analyses showed a 46% probability of fidaxomicin being 
cost-effective versus vancomycin at a willingness-to-pay threshold of JPY 
5,000,000 per QALY gained. At a threshold of JPY 7,500,000, there was a 54% 
probability of fidaxomicin being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin treatment in patients with CDI following failure of 
metronidazole improves health outcomes with partial offset of higher drug 
acquisition costs versus vancomycin.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS; also designated as acne inversa) is a chronic 
inflammatory disorder, which affects the intertriginous skin and is associated 
with numerous systemic comorbidities. The estimated prevalence of HS is ~1% in 
most studied countries. Typically starting in early adulthood, cutaneous 
inflamed nodules, abscesses and pus-discharging tunnels develop in axillary, 
inguinal, gluteal and perianal body sites. The comorbidities of HS include 
metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, which contribute to reduced life 
expectancy. A genetic predisposition, smoking, obesity and hormonal factors are 
established aetiological factors for HS. Cutaneous changes seem to start around 
hair follicles and involve activation of cells of the innate and adaptive immune 
systems, with pivotal roles for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour 
necrosis factor, IL-1β and IL-17. The unrestricted and chronic immune response 
eventually leads to severe pain, pus discharge, irreversible tissue destruction 
and scar development. HS has profound negative effects on patients' quality of 
life, which often culminate in social withdrawal, unemployment, depression and 
suicidal thoughts. The therapeutic options for HS comprise antibiotic treatment, 
neutralization of tumour necrosis factor and surgical intervention together with 
lifestyle modification. Nevertheless, there is an enormous need for awareness of 
HS, understanding of its pathogenesis and novel treatments.

BACKGROUND: Measuring the performance of a health system is an essential 
requirement in creating systems that generate efficient, equitable, 
patient-focused, accessible and sustainable results. A fundamental requirement 
for a performance measurement system is the development of an assessment 
framework within which specific performance measures could be defined and 
applied regularly. This paper examines the comprehensiveness of Ghana's health 
system assessment framework called the Holistic Assessment Tool in relation to 
some of the internationally recognized frameworks. The paper also analyzes 
trends in the performance of the health system to understand whether or not an 
improvement has been recorded following the adoption and implementation of the 
Holistic Assessment Tool.
METHODS: Mainly secondary data were used in this analysis. Searches were 
conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct between May and 
July, 2019 for published documents on health system performance assessment. We 
also obtained unpublished documents from Ghana's Ministry of Health, Ghana 
Health Service website, and Ghana Statistical Service database. Descriptive 
statistics were used to examine trends in the performance of the Ghanaian health 
system.
RESULTS: While the tool provides a national framework for evaluating the 
performance of the Ghana Health system in several domains, the Holistic 
Assessment Tool does not cover key health system domains such as information 
systems for health, access to essential medicines, and patient-centeredness. 
Also, the scope of the assessment program seems limited to the evaluation of the 
Ministry of Health's annual plans, programs and projects. However, the health 
system has recorded improvements in population health indicators, such as life 
expectancy at birth, infant mortality, under-5 mortality, HIV prevalence and 
disease burden (in terms of disability adjusted life years).
CONCLUSIONS: The Holistic Assessment Tool is a useful framework, but needs 
further refinement, both in scope and in conceptual robustness. Future studies 
should consider exploring factors influencing performance of the Ghanaian health 
system. Such information will help in strategizing for better and more 
improvements.

From sunscreens to medicines: Can a dissipation hypothesis explain the 
beneficial aspects of many plant compounds?

Medicine has utilised plant-based treatments for millennia, but precisely how 
they work is unclear. One approach is to use a thermodynamic viewpoint that life 
arose by dissipating geothermal and/or solar potential. Hence, the ability to 
dissipate energy to maintain homeostasis is a fundamental principle in all life, 
which can be viewed as an accretion system where layers of complexity have built 
upon core abiotic molecules. Many of these compounds are chromophoric and are 
now involved in multiple pathways. Plants have further evolved a plethora of 
chromophoric compounds that can not only act as sunscreens and redox modifiers, 
but also have now become integrated into a generalised stress adaptive system. 
This could be an extension of the dissipative process. In animals, many of these 
compounds are hormetic, modulating mitochondria and calcium signalling. They can 
also display anti-pathogen effects. They could therefore modulate bioenergetics 
across all life due to the conserved electron transport chain and proton 
gradient. In this review paper, we focus on well-described medicinal compounds, 
such as salicylic acid and cannabidiol and suggest, at least in animals, their 
activity reflects their evolved function in plants in relation to stress 
adaptation, which itself evolved to maintain dissipative homeostasis.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: A risk-stratification score may be useful for colorectal 
cancer (CRC) screening, alongside screening colonoscopy (CS) and fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of population-based CRC screening strategies using CS, FIT, 
and the Japanese CRC screening score.
METHODS: The effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
cost-effectiveness, and required number of CS procedures were evaluated for 
screening strategies with primary screening CS (strategy 1), FIT (strategy 2), 
and the risk score (strategy 3), using a simulation model analysis with two 
scenarios. In scenario 1, uptake rates for all tests were 60%. In scenario 2, 
uptake rates for FIT and a risk score were 40%, and those for screening CS and 
CS following a positive FIT or high risk score were 20% and 70%, respectively.
RESULTS: In scenario 1, strategy 1 gained the highest QALYs and required the 
highest cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per QALY gained for 
strategy 1 against the others were lower than 5 000 000 JPY. Strategy 1 required 
more than twice as many CS procedures as the other strategies. In scenario 2, 
strategy 3 had the highest QALYs and lowest cost, and strategy 1 had the lowest 
QALYs and highest cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening CS has the potential to be the most effective and 
cost-effective form of CRC screening, although it requires a large number of CS 
procedures. However, if non-invasive tests are preferred by recipients, other 
screening strategies, particularly those using the risk score, can be more 
effective and cost-effective.

Interactions between biomolecules control the processes of life in health and 
their malfunction in disease, making their characterization and quantification 
essential. Immobilization- and label-free analytical techniques are desirable 
because of their simplicity and minimal invasiveness, but they struggle with 
quantifying tight interactions. Here, we show that mass photometry can 
accurately count, distinguish by molecular mass, and thereby reveal the relative 
abundances of different unlabelled biomolecules and their complexes in mixtures 
at the single-molecule level. These measurements determine binding affinities 
over four orders of magnitude at equilibrium for both simple and complex 
stoichiometries within minutes, as well as the associated kinetics. These 
results introduce mass photometry as a rapid, simple and label-free method for 
studying sub-micromolar binding affinities, with potential for extension towards 
a universal approach for characterizing complex biomolecular interactions.

INTRODUCTION: The complexity of the treatment of herpetic keratoconjunctivitis 
is due to the severity of the disease, complications, the transition to chronic 
relapsing forms and the insufficient effectiveness of the drugs used, which 
leads to a steady increase in the number of patients. The aim of the study was 
to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the eye drug films «GlazAvir» in the 
experimental model of acute herpetic eye infection in rabbits.
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: to study the specific activity of «GlazAvir» and compare 
the long-term indicators of the level of manifestation of individual clinical 
signs of keratoconjunctivitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the work we used rabbits of the Chinchilla breed, the 
herpes simplex virus type 1 and the eye drug films «GlazAvir». A model of 
ophthalmic herpetic infection was formed by infection of rabbits with 
virus-containing material of a pre-scarified eye cornea against the background 
of local anesthesia. Аnimals were treated with the drug «GlazAvir» - 1 
application per day for 7 days. Animals were observed daily for 15 days, then 
every 3 days until the 25th day of observation. The effectiveness of the drug 
was evaluated at the peak of the development of the pathological process.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was a decrease in mortality from 50 to 20%, and an 
increase in average life expectancy by 27.87%, compared with the control in 
animals treated with «GlazAvir». It was noted after activation of herpetic 
keratoconjunctivitis on the 2nd - 5th day, at the peak of the disease (6-9th 
day) a statistically significant decrease in the activity of the pathological 
process (p<0.05) by rabbits treated with the «GlazAvir» ophthalmic drug films. 
The tendency to normalization by the rabbits treated with the «GlazAvir» 
preparation was observed until the 14th day.
CONCLUSION: The data obtained indicate the pronounced effectiveness of the 
«GlazAvir» preparation in the treatment of experimental herpesvirus 
keratoconjunctivitis.

The Archaea domain was recognized as a separate phylogenetic lineage in the tree 
of life nearly 3 decades ago. It is now known as part of the human microbiome; 
however, given that its roles in oral sites are still poorly understood, this 
review aimed to establish the current level of evidence regarding archaea in the 
oral cavity to guide future research, providing insights on the present 
knowledge about the human oral archaeome. A scoping review was conducted with 
the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Five electronic databases 
were searched, as well as gray literature. Two independent reviewers performed 
the selection and characterization of the studies. Clinical studies were 
included when the target population consisted of humans of any age who were 
donors of samples from the oral cavity. A qualitative analysis was performed, 
based on the type of oral site and by considering the methods employed for 
archaeal identification and taxonomy, including the DNA extraction protocols, 
primers, and probes used. Fifty articles were included in the final scoping 
review, published from 1987 to 2019. Most studies sampled periodontal sites. 
Methanogens were the most abundant archaea in those sites, and their presence 
could be associated with other periodontal pathogens. No consistent relationship 
with different disease conditions was observed in studies that evaluated the 
microbiota surviving in endodontic sites. Few articles analyzed the presence of 
archaea in dental caries, saliva, or tongue microbiota, as well as in 
archaeologic samples, also showing a relationship with healthy microbiota. 
Archaea have been detected in different oral niches of individuals from diverse 
geographic locations and clinical conditions, suggesting potential roles in oral 
diseases. Methodological limitations may hamper our current knowledge about 
archaeal diversity and prevalence in oral samples, and future research with 
diversified methodological approaches may lead to a better comprehension of the 
human oral archaeome.

BACKGROUND: Future projections for both TKA and THA in the United States and 
other countries forecast a further increase of already high numbers of joint 
replacements. The consensus is that in industrialized countries, this increase 
is driven by demographic changes with more elderly people being less willing to 
accept activity limitations. Unlike the United States, Germany and many other 
countries face a population decline driven by low fertility rates, longer life 
expectancy, and immigration rates that cannot compensate for population aging. 
Many developing countries are likely to follow that example in the short or 
medium term amid global aging. Due to growing healthcare expenditures in a 
declining and aging population with a smaller available work force, reliable 
predictions of procedure volume by age groups are requisite for health and 
fiscal policy makers to maintain high standards in arthroplasty for the future 
population.Questions/purposes (1) By how much is the usage of primary TKA and 
THA in Germany expected to increase from 2016 through 2040? (2) How is 
arthroplasty usage in Germany expected to vary as a function of patient age 
during this time span?
METHODS: The annual number of primary TKAs and THAs were calculated based on 
population projections and estimates of future healthcare expenditures as a 
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in Germany. For this purpose, a 
Poisson regression analysis using age, gender, state, healthcare expenditure, 
and calendar year as covariates was performed. The dependent variable was the 
historical number of primary TKAs and THAs performed as compiled by the German 
federal office of statistics for the years 2005 through 2016.
RESULTS: Through 2040, the incidence rate for both TKA and THA will continue to 
increase annually. For TKA, the incidence rate is expected to increase from 245 
TKAs per 100,000 inhabitants to 379 (297-484) (55%, 95% CI 21 to 98). The 
incidence rate of THAs is anticipated to increase from 338 to 437 (357-535) per 
100,000 inhabitants (29% [95% CI 6 to 58]) between 2016 and 2040. The total 
number of TKAs is expected to increase by 45% (95% CI 14 to 8), from 168,772 
procedures in 2016 to 244,714 (95% CI 191,920 to 312,551) in 2040. During the 
same period, the number of primary THAs is expected to increase by 23% (95% CI 0 
to 50), from 229,726 to 282,034 (95% CI 230,473 to 345,228). Through 2040, the 
greatest increase in TKAs is predicted to occur in patients aged 40 to 69 years 
(40- to 49-year-old patients: 269% (95% CI 179 to 390); 50- to 59-year-old 
patients: 94% (95% CI 48 to 141); 60- to 69-year-old patients: 43% (95% CI 13 to 
82). The largest increase in THAs is expected in the elderly (80- to 89-year-old 
patients (71% [95% CI 40 to 110]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the total number of TKAs and THAs is projected to increase 
in Germany between now and 2040, the increase will be smaller than that 
previously forecast for the United States, due in large part to the German 
population decreasing over that time, while the American population increases. 
Much of the projected increase in Germany will be from the use of TKA in younger 
patients and from the use of THA in elderly patients. Knowledge of these trends 
may help planning by surgeons, hospitals, stakeholders, and policy makers in 
countries similar to Germany, where high incidence rates of arthroplasty, aging 
populations, and overall decreasing populations are present.

BACKGROUND: Cancer treatment often causes side effects, among which fatigue is 
common and can persist for years among disease-free cancer survivors. Living 
with fatigue can lead to reduced life expectancy and quality of life.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe oncology nurses' experiences of meeting with 
men with cancer and talking about cancer-related fatigue.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The data were collected via semi-structured interviews with 
nine oncology nurses recruited using a purposeful sampling method and analysed 
using thematic content analysis. This qualitative design was conducted to 
describe and interpret the content of experiences.
ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: The study was approved by a regional Ethical Review 
Board, and research ethical principles were followed.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed one major theme, namely take the whole person 
into consideration, and three subthemes: the importance of (i) establishing 
trust in the nurse-patient relationship, (ii) supporting the patient's 
understanding of cancer-related fatigue, and (iii) managing the challenging 
emotions experienced by patients. The major theme describes the oncology nurses' 
approach when meeting with men with cancer-related fatigue.
CONCLUSION: The results provide insight into how oncology nurses can increase 
their knowledge about fatigue to establish trust in nurse-patient relationships. 
They can acquire knowledge about how to make men with cancer-related fatigue 
feel safe when handling their daily lives despite their fatigue. Oncology nurses 
require knowledge, presence and commitment in their interactions with men with 
cancer-related fatigue to be able to take the whole person into consideration. 
This study demonstrates the importance of the approach oncology nurses take when 
interacting with men with cancer-related fatigue and the strategies required 
when talking about cancer-related fatigue.

Individuals With an Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Reconstructed Knee Display 
Atypical Whole Body Movement Strategies but Normal Knee Robustness During 
Side-Hop Landings: A Finite Helical Axis Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Atypical knee joint biomechanics after anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction (ACLR) are common. It is, however, unclear whether knee 
robustness (ability to tolerate perturbation and maintain joint configuration) 
and whole body movement strategies are compromised after ACLR.
PURPOSE: To investigate landing control after ACLR with regard to dynamic knee 
robustness and whole body movement strategies during sports-mimicking side hops, 
and to evaluate functional performance of hop tests and knee strength.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: An 8-camera motion capture system and 2 synchronized force plates were 
used to calculate joint angles and moments during standardized rebound side-hop 
landings performed by 32 individuals with an ACL-reconstructed knee (ACLR group; 
median, 16.0 months after reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft 
[interquartile range, 35.2 months]) and 32 matched asymptomatic controls (CTRL). 
Dynamic knee robustness was quantified using a finite helical axis approach, 
providing discrete values quantifying divergence of knee joint movements from 
flexion-extension (higher relative frontal and/or transverse plane motion 
equaled lower robustness) during momentary helical rotation intervals of 10°. 
Multivariate analyses of movement strategies included trunk, hip, and knee 
angles at initial contact and during landing and hip and knee peak moments 
during landing, comparing ACLR and CTRL, as well as legs within groups.
RESULTS: Knee robustness was lower for the first 10° motion interval after 
initial contact and then successively stabilized for both groups and legs. When 
landing with the injured leg, the ACLR group, as compared with the contralateral 
leg and/or CTRL, demonstrated significantly greater flexion of the trunk, hip, 
and knee; greater hip flexion moment; less knee flexion moment; and smaller 
angle but greater moment of knee internal rotation. The ACLR group also had 
lower but acceptable hop and strength performances (ratios to noninjured leg 
>90%) except for knee flexion strength (12% deficit).
CONCLUSION: Knee robustness was not affected by ACLR during side-hop landings, 
but alterations in movement strategies were seen for the trunk, hip, and knee, 
as well as long-term deficits in knee flexion strength.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knee robustness is lowest immediately after landing for both 
the ACLR group and the CTRL and should be targeted in training to reduce knee 
injury risk. Assessment of movement strategies during side-hop landings after 
ACLR should consider a whole body approach.

BACKGROUND: There is little conformity regarding the surgical treatment of 
metastasis of the proximal femur, especially in palliative patients with limited 
life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: En-bloc resection of secondary bone malignancies of the 
proximal femur and reconstruction by modular arthroplasty was performed in a 
consecutive series of 45 patients. The mean follow-up period was 16.4 months 
(0.6-74.7).
RESULTS: The survival rate of all patients was 6.6% (95% CI: 0-14.9) at 74.7 
months. There was no significant difference in patients with a solitary or 
disseminated disease at index operation (log-rank p = 0.1214). Recurrent 
dislocation was the most frequent local complication (n = 6) necessitating an 
open reduction in four cases. The use of a Trevira tube showed a higher risk of 
dislocation compared to the simple bonding of remaining soft tissue (6 out of 28 
vs. 0 out of 17; Fisher test: p = 0.0463). The worst-case survival rate with the 
removal of the arthroplasty for any cause and/or loss to follow-up was 80.0% 
(95% CI: 44.9-100) at 74.7 months (n = 1 due to low-grade infection).
CONCLUSIONS: En-bloc resection of metastases and reconstruction by modular 
arthroplasty is reliable even in patients with very limited life expectancy. 
Local complications due to tumor growth or instability after intralesional 
surgery could be managed successfully but recurrent dislocation as the most 
frequent complication has to be taken into account. The simple bonding of 
remaining soft tissue around the prosthesis without the use of an attachment 
tube may reduce the dislocation rate and reoperation risk.

A number of previous studies have investigated the possibilities of modelling 
the change in density of bones. Remodeling can be formulated at the constitutive 
or the kinematic level. In this work we introduce a formulation for the density 
growth process which takes not only the mechanical stimulus into account but 
also the influence of age on the evolution of growth. We demonstrate the 
implementation in the context of the finite element method. This novel approach 
is illustrated for a simple uniaxial extension test and is verified against 
previous numerical results. Moreover, two further physiologically motivated 
examples are performed. The results of the proposed modified model show 
excellent agreement with comparable results from literature and are promising 
for the application to real-life problems.
