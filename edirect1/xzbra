BACKGROUND: Women have better patient outcomes in HIV care and treatment than 
men in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed--at the population level--whether and to 
what extent mass HIV treatment is associated with changes in sex disparities in 
adult life expectancy, a summary metric of survival capturing mortality across 
the full cascade of HIV care. We also determined sex-specific trends in HIV 
mortality and the distribution of HIV-related deaths in men and women prior to 
and at each stage of the clinical cascade.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected on all deaths occurring from 2001 to 
2011 in a large population-based surveillance cohort (52,964 women and 45,688 
men, ages 15 y and older) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Cause of death 
was ascertained by verbal autopsy (93% response rate). Demographic data were 
linked at the individual level to clinical records from the public sector HIV 
treatment and care program that serves the region. Annual rates of HIV-related 
mortality were assessed for men and women separately, and female-to-male rate 
ratios were estimated in exponential hazard models. Sex-specific trends in adult 
life expectancy and HIV-cause-deleted adult life expectancy were calculated. The 
proportions of HIV deaths that accrued to men and women at different stages in 
the HIV cascade of care were estimated annually. Following the beginning of HIV 
treatment scale-up in 2004, HIV mortality declined among both men and women. 
Female adult life expectancy increased from 51.3 y (95% CI 49.7, 52.8) in 2003 
to 64.5 y (95% CI 62.7, 66.4) in 2011, a gain of 13.2 y. Male adult life 
expectancy increased from 46.9 y (95% CI 45.6, 48.2) in 2003 to 55.9 y (95% CI 
54.3, 57.5) in 2011, a gain of 9.0 y. The gap between female and male adult life 
expectancy doubled, from 4.4 y in 2003 to 8.6 y in 2011, a difference of 4.3 y 
(95% CI 0.9, 7.6). For women, HIV mortality declined from 1.60 deaths per 100 
person-years (95% CI 1.46, 1.75) in 2003 to 0.56 per 100 person-years (95% CI 
0.48, 0.65) in 2011. For men, HIV-related mortality declined from 1.71 per 100 
person-years (95% CI 1.55, 1.88) to 0.76 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.67, 
0.87) in the same period. The female-to-male rate ratio for HIV mortality 
declined from 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.07) in 2003 to 0.73 (95% CI 0.60-0.89) in 
2011, a statistically significant decline (p = 0.046). In 2011, 57% and 41% of 
HIV-related deaths occurred among men and women, respectively, who had never 
sought care for HIV in spite of the widespread availability of free HIV 
treatment. The results presented here come from a poor rural setting in southern 
Africa with high HIV prevalence and high HIV treatment coverage; broader 
generalizability is unknown. Additionally, factors other than HIV treatment 
scale-up may have influenced population mortality trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Mass HIV treatment has been accompanied by faster declines in HIV 
mortality among women than men and a growing female-male disparity in adult life 
expectancy at the population level. In 2011, over half of male HIV deaths 
occurred in men who had never sought clinical HIV care. Interventions to 
increase HIV testing and linkage to care among men are urgently needed.

Command, Fuzhou, P.R. China;§Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital, The 
Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, P.R. China;¶Department of 
Orthopedics, No. 451 Hospital of PLA, Xi'an, P.R. China.

BACKGROUND: Loss of axial rotation and lateral bending after atlantoaxial fusion 
reduces a patient's quality of life. Therefore, effective, nonfusion fixation 
alternatives are needed for atlantoaxial instability.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the initial stability and function of posterior 
atlantoaxial restricted nonfusion fixation (PAARNF), a new protocol, using 
cadaveric cervical spines compared with the intact state, destabilization, and 
posterior C1-C2 rod fixation.
METHODS: Cervical areas C0 through C3 were used from 6 cadaveric spines to test 
flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation range of motion (ROM). 
With the use of a machine, 1.5-Nm torque at a rate of 0.1 Nm/s was used and held 
for 10 seconds. The specimens were loaded 3 times, and data were collected in 
the third cycle and tested in the following sequence: (1) intact, (2) 
destabilization (using a type II odontoid fracture model), (3) destabilization 
with PAARNF (PAARNF group), and (4) rod implantation (rod group). The order of 
tests for the PAARNF and rod groups was randomly assigned.
RESULTS: The average flexion-extension ROM in the PAARNF group was 7.44 ± 2.05°, 
which was significantly less than in the intact (P = .00) and destabilization (P 
= .00) groups but not significantly different from that of the rod group (P = 
.07). The average lateral bending ROM (10.59 ± 2.33°; P = .00) and axial 
rotation ROM (38.79 ± 13.41°; P = .00) of the PAARNF group were significantly 
greater than in the rod group. However, the values of the PAARNF group showed no 
significant differences compared with those of the intact group.
CONCLUSION: PAARNF restricted atlantoaxial flexion-extension but preserved axial 
rotation and lateral bending at the atlantoaxial joint in a type II odontoid 
fracture model. However, it should not be used clinically until further studies 
have been performed to test the long-term effects of this procedure.

Background. Cardiovascular complications are known to be the main determinants 
of reduced life expectancy and decreased quality of life in acromegaly patients. 
Our study aimed to provide insight into the cardiovascular changes that occur in 
acromegaly patients and to investigate the correlative risk factors. Methods. A 
total of 108 patients definitively diagnosed with acromegaly and 108 controls 
matched for age and gender were recruited into study and control groups, 
respectively. Standard echocardiography was performed on all of the 
participants, and data were collected and analyzed. Results. All acromegaly 
patients presented with structural cardiac changes, including a larger heart 
cavity, thicker myocardial walls, and increased great vessel diameters compared 
with the control group. Additionally, the acromegaly patients presented with 
reduced diastolic function. Aging and increased body mass index (BMI) were 
correlated with myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction; a longer 
disease duration was correlated with larger great vessel diameters. Conclusions. 
Ageing and increased BMI are independent risk factors for acromegalic 
cardiomyopathy, and a long disease duration results in the expansion of great 
vessels. Increased efforts should be made to diagnose acromegaly at an early 
stage and to advise acromegaly patients to maintain a healthy weight.

The accumulation of amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of several major human 
diseases. Although the formation of these supramolecular entities has previously 
been associated with proteins and peptides, it was later demonstrated that even 
phenylalanine, a single amino acid, can form fibrils that have amyloid-like 
biophysical, biochemical, and cytotoxic properties. Moreover, the generation of 
antibodies against these assemblies in phenylketonuria patients and the 
correlating mice model suggested a pathological role for the assemblies. We 
determine that several other metabolites that accumulate in metabolic disorders 
form ordered amyloid-like ultrastructures, which induce apoptotic cell death, as 
observed for amyloid structures. The formation of amyloid-like assemblies by 
metabolites implies a general phenomenon of amyloid formation, not limited to 
proteins and peptides, and offers a new paradigm for metabolic diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) is the recommended 
approach to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). Overdiagnosis and sampling errors 
represent major limitations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy 
(MRTB) detects higher proportion of significant PCa and reduces diagnosis of 
insignificant PCa. Costs prevent MRTB from becoming the new standard in PCa 
diagnosis. The present study aimed at assessing whether added costs of MRI 
outweigh benefits of MRTB in a cost-utility model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-year gained (QALY) and costs for 2 strategies (the standard 12-core TRUSGB 
strategy and the MRTB strategy) over 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. MRI was used as 
triage test in biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion of PCa. The model takes 
into account probability of men harboring PCa, diagnostic accuracy of both 
procedures, and probability of being assigned to various treatment options. 
Direct medical costs based on health care system perspective were included.
RESULTS: Following standard TRUSGB pathway, calculated cumulative effects at 5, 
10, 15, and 20 years were 4.25, 7.17, 9.03, and 10.09 QALY, respectively. 
Cumulative effects in MRTB pathway were 4.29, 7.26, 9.17, and 10.26 QALY, 
correspondingly. Costs related to TRUSGB strategy were $8,027, $11,406, $14,883, 
and $17,587 at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively, as compared with $7,231, 
$10,450, $13,267, and $15,400 for the MRTB strategy. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, 
MRTB was the established dominant strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of MRI and MRTB in PCa diagnosis and management 
represents a cost-effective measure at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after initial 
diagnosis.

Spinal cord epidural metastasis (SEM) is a common complication of systemic 
cancer. Predicting these patient's survival is a key factor to select the proper 
treatment modality, but the three most used score scales to predict their 
survival (Tokuhashi revised score, Tomita score and Bauer modified score) were 
designed in single institutions and their reliability to predict correctly the 
patient's survival were first tested only in those specific populations. This 
prognostication issue is addressed in this article, evaluating retrospectively 
the survival of 17 patients with SEM from a Brazilian general hospital with 
these score scales. Our results show that the actual survival of those patients 
were worse than the predicted of all three score scales, suggesting that 
differences between the different populations might have affected their 
reliability and alert that their usage as a major factor to select the most 
appropriate treatment have to be done with caution.

BACKGROUND: Previous economic studies of person-centered palliative home care 
have been conducted mainly among patients with cancer. Studies on 
cost-effectiveness of advanced home care for patients with severe heart failure 
are lacking when a diagnosis of heart failure is the only main disease as the 
inclusion criterion.
AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a new concept of care called 
person-centered integrated heart failure and palliative home care.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from January 2011 to 2013 at 
a center in Sweden. Data collection included cost estimates for health care and 
the patients' responses to the EQ-5D quality of life instrument.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic and severe heart failure were 
randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 36) or control (n = 36) group. The 
intervention group received the Palliative Advanced Home Care and Heart Failure 
Care intervention over 6 months. The control group received the same care that 
is usually provided by a primary health care center or heart failure clinic at 
the hospital.
RESULTS: EQ-5D data indicated that the intervention resulted in a gain of 0.25 
quality-adjusted life years, and cost analysis showed a significant cost 
reduction with the Palliative Advanced Home Care and Heart Failure Care 
intervention. Even if costs for staffing are higher than usual care, this is 
more than made up for by the reduced need for hospital-based care. This 
intervention made it possible for the county council to use €50,000 for other 
needs.
CONCLUSION: The Palliative Advanced Home Care and Heart Failure Care working 
mode saves financial resources and should be regarded as very cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of measuring the burden of disease involves 
aggregating morbidity and mortality components into a single indicator, the 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to measure how much and how people live 
and suffer the impact of a disease.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of disease due to AIDS in a 
municipality of southern Brazil.
METHODS: An ecological study was conducted in 2009 to examine the incidence and 
AIDS-related deaths among the population residing in the city of Tubarao, Santa 
Catarina State, Brazil. Data from the Mortality Information System in the 
National Health System was used to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to 
premature mortality. The calculation was based on the difference between a 
standardized life expectancy and age at death, with a discount rate of 3% per 
year. Data from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases were used to 
calculate the years lived with disability (YLD). The DALY was estimated by the 
sum of YLL and YLD. Indicator rates were estimated per 100,000 inhabitants, 
distributed by age and gender.
RESULTS: A total of 131 records were examined, and a 572.5 DALYs were estimated, 
which generated a rate of 593.1 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. The rate among men 
amounted to 780.7 DALYs/100,000, whereas among women the rate was 417.1 
DALYs/100,000. The most affected age groups were 30-44 years for men and 60-69 
years for women.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease due to AIDS in the city of Tubarao was 
relatively high when considering the global trend. The mortality component 
accounted for more than 90% of the burden of disease.

INTRODUÇÃO: A proposta de mensuração do impacto da doença implica a integração 
em um mesmo indicador, o DALY, de componentes de morbidade e mortalidade, para 
medir quanto e como as populações vivem e sofrem o impacto de determinada 
doença.
OBJETIVO: Estimar o impacto da doença causada pela Aids em um município do sul 
do Brasil.
MÉTODOS: Foi desenvolvido um estudo ecológico envolvendo registros de incidência 
e de óbitos por Aids na população residente em Tubarão, SC, em 2009. Para 
cálculo do componente de mortalidade-YLL foram utilizados dados de mortalidade 
do Sistema de Informações de Mortalidade do Sistema Único de Saúde. Calculou-se 
pela diferença de uma expectativa de vida padronizada e a idade do óbito, 
aplicada uma taxa de desconto de 3% ao ano. Para cálculo do componente de 
morbidade-YLD foram utilizados dados do Sistema de Informação de Agravos de 
Notificação. O DALY foi estimado pela soma do YLL e YLD. Foram estimadas as 
taxas dos indicadores por 100 mil habitantes segundo sexo e faixa etária.
RESULTADOS: Foram analisados 131 registros e estimados 572,5 DALYs, o que gerou 
uma taxa de 593,1 DALYs/100 mil habitantes. No sexo masculino a taxa foi de 
780,7 DALY/100 mil homens, já nas mulheres esta taxa correspondeu a 417,1 
DALYs/100 mil mulheres. As faixas etárias mais acometidas foram de 30 a 44 anos 
no sexo masculino e de 60 a 69 anos no sexo feminino.
CONCLUSÃO: O impacto da doença causada pela Aids no município de Tubarão 
mostrou-se elevado quando considerada a tendência global. O componente de 
mortalidade contribuiu com mais de 90% do indicador de impacto da doença.

BACKGROUND: A previous economic analysis of self-management, that is, 
self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication evaluated 
cost-effectiveness among patients with uncomplicated hypertension. This study 
considered cost-effectiveness of self-management in those with raised blood 
pressure plus diabetes, chronic kidney disease and/or previous cardiovascular 
disease.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model-based economic evaluation was undertaken to 
estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of self-management of blood pressure 
in a cohort of 70-year-old 'high risk' patients, compared with usual care. The 
model used the results of the TASMIN-SR trial. A cost-utility analysis was 
undertaken from a UK health and social care perspective, taking into account 
lifetime costs of treatment, cardiovascular events and quality adjusted life 
years. A subgroup analysis ran the model separately for men and women. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time 
horizons and reduced effectiveness of self-management.
RESULTS: Base-case results indicated that self-management was cost-effective 
compared with usual care, resulting in more quality adjusted life years (0.21) 
and cost savings (-£830) per patient. There was a 99% chance of the intervention 
being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per quality 
adjusted life year gained. Similar results were found for separate cohorts of 
men and women. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses, provided that 
the blood pressure lowering effect of self-management was maintained for more 
than a year.
CONCLUSION: Self-management of blood pressure in high-risk people with poorly 
controlled hypertension not only reduces blood pressure, compared with usual 
care, but also represents a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

AIMS: To review comprehensively the prevalence, treatment and control of 
hypertension; and to estimate the burden of hypertension in China, thereby 
aiding Chinese health policies for better prevention and control of this 
condition.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMbase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, 
Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases were searched for population-based studies 
published in English and Chinese that described prevalence, treatment and 
control of hypertension in China, as well as deaths and disabilities attributed 
to hypertension. All research papers were published between January 1999 and May 
2014. Data from 178 studies involving over 2,901,464 participants covering 30 
provinces were pooled. Overall, rates of prevalence, treatment and control of 
hypertension were 28.9%, 35.3% and 13.4% in China. A statistically significant 
association was observed between temperature gradient and the prevalence of 
hypertension. There were 10,667 (95% confidence interval 8063-13,345) 
disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people. In total, 78.3% of 
disability-adjusted life years were from years lived with disability and 21.7% 
from years of life lost due to premature mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been a slight improvement in rates for the 
treatment and control of hypertension, these rates were still suboptimal, 
especially for men and people living in rural areas. Low and middle-income 
provinces had a comparatively huge burden of hypertension, which is a 
considerable risk factor for reducing life expectancy. Our analysis may be 
helpful in generating a current overview of hypertension in China.

Recent years have seen substantial improvements in life expectancy and access to 
antimicrobials, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, but 
increasing pathogen resistance to antimicrobials threatens to roll back this 
progress. Resistant organisms in health-care and community settings pose a 
threat to survival rates from serious infections, including neonatal sepsis and 
health-care-associated infections, and limit the potential health benefits from 
surgeries, transplants, and cancer treatment. The challenge of simultaneously 
expanding appropriate access to antimicrobials, while restricting inappropriate 
access, particularly to expensive, newer generation antimicrobials, is unique in 
global health and requires new approaches to financing and delivering health 
care and a one-health perspective on the connections between pathogen 
transmission in animals and humans. Here, we describe the importance of 
effective antimicrobials. We assess the disease burden caused by limited access 
to antimicrobials, attributable to resistance to antimicrobials, and the 
potential effect of vaccines in restricting the need for antibiotics.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate 15-year patency and life 
expectancy after endovascular treatment (EVT) with primary stenting guided by 
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for iliac artery lesions.
BACKGROUND: Fifteen-year patency, factors causing restenosis, and survival after 
IVUS-guided EVT are unclear based on the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus 
II (TASC-II) classification in peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
METHODS: EVT was performed for 507 lesions in 455 patients with PAD. The 15-year 
endpoints were primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency; overall 
survival; freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); and freedom 
from major adverse cardiovascular and limb events (MACLE).
RESULTS: The 5-, 10-, and 15-year primary and secondary patencies were 89%, 83%, 
and 75%, respectively, and 92%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. There were no 
significant differences among TASC-II categories.
CONCLUSIONS: IVUS-guided stenting for the iliac artery had favorable 15-year 
patency in all TASC categories. Life expectancy after EVT was poor, but stenting 
is feasible for patients with PAD.

Hisar, Haryana 125004 India.

Guava is a climacteric fruit so physico-chemical changes continuously occur 
after harvest till fruit become unfit for consumption and suffers from post 
harvest losses. The main objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness 
of individual film in form of Shrink and Cling wrap on shelf life of guava. 
Fruits were individually packed in polythene bags (LDPE) of 200 gauge thickness 
by Shrink and Cling wrapping and stored at 7 ± 3 °C. Individual wrapping reduced 
the magnitude of changes during storage i.e., ripening process drastically as 
evident from lower total soluble solids, higher ascorbic acid, polyphenol 
content with lower polyphenol oxidase activity and physiological loss of weight 
(PLW) was less than 3.5 %. Film wrapping preserved freshness of wrapped fruits 
as they remained acceptable for whole storage time in contrast to control fruits 
which turned unacceptable by 15(th) day of storage. Control fruits showed 
significant compositional changes as well as in polyphenol content, ascorbic 
acid and reduced number of marketable fruits while Cling and Shrink wrapping 
enhanced the shelf life by 10 days.

Irinotecan hydrochloride is a camptothecin derivative that exerts antitumor 
activity against a variety of tumors. SN-38 produced in the body by 
carboxylesterase is the active metabolite of irinotecan. After irinotecan was 
introduced for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) at the end of 
the last century, survival has improved dramatically. Irinotecan is now combined 
with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and several molecularly-targeted anticancer 
drugs, resulting in the extension of overall survival to longer than 30 mo. 
Severe, occasionally life-threatening toxicity occurs sporadically, even in 
patients in relatively good condition who have a low risk of 
chemotherapy-induced toxicity, often causing the failure of irinotecan-based 
chemotherapy. Clinical pharmacological studies have revealed that such severe 
toxicity is related to exposure to SN-38 and genetic polymorphisms in 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene. The large inter- and intra-patient 
variability in systemic exposure to SN-38 is determined not only by genetic 
factors but also by physiological and environmental factors. This review first 
summarizes the roles of irinotecan in chemotherapy for metastatic CRC and then 
discusses the optimal dosing of irinotecan based on the aforementioned factors 
affecting systemic exposure to SN-38, with the ultimate goal of achieving 
personalized irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

Treatment Center, Shanghai, China (YM, JH, HZ); and Department of Ophthalmology, 
Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (YM, 
JH, BZ, QS, YM, HZ).

PURPOSE: To explore the cost-utility of cataract surgery in patients with 
advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as having and treated for age-related 
cataract and with a history of advanced AMD at the Department of Ophthalmology, 
Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, were included in the 
study. All of the participants underwent successful phacoemulsification with 
foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation under retrobulbar 
anesthesia. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and utility value elicited by 
time trade-off method from patients at 3-month postoperative time were compared 
with those before surgery. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in a 
lifetime were calculated at a 3% annual discounted rate. Costs per QALY gained 
were calculated using the bootstrap method, and probabilities of being 
cost-effective were presented using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA in the operated 
eye increased from 1.37 ± 0.5 (Snellen, 20/469) to 0.98 ± 0.25 (Snellen, 20/191) 
(p < 0.001); BCVA in the weighted average from both eyes (=75% better eye + 25% 
worse eye) was changed from 1.13 ± 0.22 (Snellen, 20/270) to 0.96 ± 0.17 
(Snellen, 20/182) (p < 0.001). Utility values from both patients and doctors 
increased significantly after surgery (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007). Patients gained 
1.17 QALYs by cataract surgery in their lifetime. The cost per QALY was 8835 
Chinese yuan (CNY) (1400 U.S. dollars [USD]). It is cost-effective at the 
threshold of 115,062 CNY (18,235 USD) per QALY in China recommended by the World 
Health Organization. The cost per QALY varied from 7045 CNY (1116 USD) to 94,178 
CNY (14,925 USD) in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity and quality of life assessed by utility value 
improved significantly after surgery. Cataract surgery was a cost-effective 
intervention for patients with coexistent AMD.

BACKGROUND: Exploration of long-term health expenditure and longevity trends 
across three major sub-regions of Eastern Europe since 1989.
METHODS: 24 countries were classified as EU 2004, CIS, or SEE. European Health 
for All Database (HFA-DB) 1989-2012 data were processed using 
difference-in-difference (DiD) and data envelopment analysis (DEA).
RESULTS: The strongest expenditure growth was recorded in EU 2004 followed by 
SEE and the CIS. A surprisingly similar longevity increase was present in SEE 
and EU 2004. In 1989, countries that joined EU in 2004 were relatively 
inefficient in the number of life-years gained yet had a lower life expectancy 
than the SEE region and was only slightly higher than the CIS region (DEA). By 
2012 the revenue spent was roughly linear to additional life-year expectancies.
CONCLUSION: EU 2004 members were the best performers in terms of balanced 
longevity increase followed by health expenditure growth. The SEE economies' 
longevity gains were lagging slightly behind at a far lower cost. An 
extrapolated CIS expenditure to longevity increase ratio has the fastest-growing 
long-term promise.

Persons with schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder have a reduced life 
expectancy due largely to death from natural causes. The reasons for this 
increased mortality have not been completely defined. We prospectively assessed 
a cohort of persons with schizophrenia and one with bipolar disorder with a 
clinical evaluation and a blood sample from which immune and infectious disease 
markers were measured. Mortality was determined with data from the National 
Death Index following a period of up to 14years. We examined the role of 
demographic, clinical, and serological factors on mortality in bivariate and 
multivariate models. A total of 43/710 (6.1%) persons with schizophrenia and 
12/406 (3.0%) with bipolar disorder died of natural causes. In the schizophrenia 
group, mortality was predicted by the following variables in a multivariate 
model: cigarette smoking (RR=6.93, 95% CI 1.59, 30.1, p=0.0099); autoimmune 
disorder (RR=8.08, 95% CI 2.50, 26.1, p=0.00047); gastrointestinal disorder (GI) 
(RR=3.53, 95% CI 1.43, 8.69 p=0.0061); and reduced maternal education (RR=0.84, 
95% CI 0.72, 0.97), p=0.018. The combination of smoking and an autoimmune 
disorder yielded an unadjusted relative risk of 18.1 for mortality, and the 
combination of smoking and a GI disorder an unadjusted relative risk of 9.45, 
compared with individuals with neither risk factor. In the bipolar disorder 
group, significant bivariate predictors of mortality included lower cognitive 
score (RR=0.95, p=.0085) and the presence of type 1 or 2 diabetes (RR=3.90, 
p=.026). Given the extraordinary high risk of death due to smoking in 
schizophrenia, smoking cessation remains an urgent priority.

AIMS: To present final efficacy/safety results from a prospective, long-term 
extension trial of onabotulinumtoxinA for urinary incontinence (UI) due to 
neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO); patients received treatment for up to 4 
years.
METHODS: Patients who completed a 52-week, phase III trial of onabotulinumtoxinA 
for NDO were eligible to enter a 3-year, multicenter, open-label extension study 
of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (200U or 300U). Patients were treated "as 
needed" based on their request and fulfillment of prespecified qualification 
criteria (≥12 weeks since previous treatment and a UI episode threshold). 
Assessments included change from study baseline in UI episodes/day (primary 
efficacy measure), volume/void, and Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) total 
score (week 6); duration of effect; adverse events (AEs); and initiation of de 
novo clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Data are presented for up to six 
treatments.
RESULTS: OnabotulinumtoxinA 200U consistently reduced UI episodes/day; 
reductions from baseline ranged from -3.2 to -4.1 across six treatments. 
Volume/void consistently increased, nearly doubling after treatment. I-QOL 
improvements were consistently greater than twice the minimally important 
difference (+11 points). Overall median duration of effect was 9.0 months 
(200U). Results were similar for onabotulinumtoxinA 300U. Most common AEs were 
urinary tract infections and urinary retention. De novo CIC rates were 29.5, 
3.4, and 6.0% (200U), and 43.0, 15.0, and 4.8% (300U) for treatments 1-3, 
respectively; de novo CIC rates were 0% for treatments 4-6.
CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatments consistently improve UI, volume/void, 
and QOL in patients with UI due to NDO in this 4-year study, with no new safety 
signals. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:368-375, 2017. © 2015 The Authors. Neurourology

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2B6 genotyping to guide efavirenz 
dosing for initial HIV therapy in the USA.
METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) 
microsimulation model to project quality-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime 
costs (2014 US dollars) for efavirenz-based HIV therapy with or without CYP2B6 
genotyping. We assumed that with genotyping 60% of patients would be eligible to 
receive lower doses.
RESULTS: Current care without CYP2B6 genotyping has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio >$100,000/QALY compared with genotype-guided dosing, 
even if lower dosing reduces efficacy. When we assumed generic efavirenz 
availability, conclusions were similar unless lower dosing reduces efficacy by 
6% or more.
CONCLUSION: CYP2B6 genotyping can inform efavirenz dosing and decrease HIV 
therapy cost.
