integrated national dementia strategic plan to guide the overall effort to 
improve dementia care in the country. It is vital to design and develop a 
national dementia plan in line with a framework outlined by the 2017 World 
Health Organization (WHO) global action plan. The health, social, and economic 
burden from dementia is expected to be high to the developing countries such as 
Ethiopia unless clear prevention and management strategies are designed at a 
national level to cascade the care to the primary care level. The planned 
strategic policy may focus on improving the knowledge and skills of health care 
professionals. Translation and cultural adaptation of cognitive, functional, and 
behavioral assessment batteries is of paramount importance in improving the 
diagnostic accuracy along with availability of advanced imaging, biomarkers, and 
dementia treatment.

BACKGROUND: Multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMNs) are rare, while 
synchronous MPMNs (SMPMNs) are even less common. Owing to the progression of 
medical technology and the extension of life expectancy, its incidence is 
gradually increasing.
CASE SUMMARY: Although reports of breast and thyroid dual cancers are common, 
cases of an additional diagnosis of kidney primary cancer within the same 
individual are rare.
CONCLUSION: We present a case of simultaneous MPMN of three endocrine organs, 
reviewing the relevant literature to enhance our understanding of SMPMNs while 
emphasizing the increasingly important need for accurate diagnosis and 
multidisciplinary management whenever this challenging situation arises.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about life expectancy (LE) with or without frailty. 
We aimed to estimate the total LE and duration of the state of frailty in China.
METHODS: This study included older adults aged 65 years and older from the 
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). Frailty status was 
classified into robust, pre-frailty and frailty based on a cumulative deficit 
model. Total and specific frailty state LEs at 65 years of age were estimated 
and stratified by demographic characteristics, behaviours, and psychosocial 
factors using continuous-time multistate modelling.
RESULTS: The total LE of older adults aged 65 years in China was 14.74 years on 
average (95% CI: 14.52-14.94), of which 4.18 years (95% CI: 4.05-4.30) were 
robust, 7.46 years (95% CI: 7.31-7.61) pre-frail and 3.10 years (95% CI: 
3.01-3.20) frail. Older adults with higher robust LE included men (4.71 years, 
95% CI: 4.56-4.88), married older adults (4.41 years, 95% CI: 4.27-4.56), those 
engaging in physical activity (4.41 years, 95% CI: 4.23-4.59), those consuming 
fruits daily (4.48 years, 95% CI: 4.22-4.77) and those with high social 
participation (4.39 years, 95% CI: 4.26-4.53). Increased educational attainment 
were gradually associated with increased robust LE.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty may lead to a reduced total LE and robust LE of older 
adults in China. In addition to finding inequalities in total and robust LEs by 
socioeconomic status, our findings also highlight that healthy behaviours and 
social participation may ease frailty-related reductions in total and robust LE. 
Our findings imply that national life-course strategies aimed at frailty 
screening and psychosocial and behavioural interventions could be important for 
health aging in China.

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy in people 
with HIV-1 (PWH), acute and chronic kidney disease remain common in this 
population and are associated with poor outcomes. A broad spectrum of kidney 
disorders can be observed in PWH, some of which are directly related to 
intrarenal HIV infection and gene expression. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) 
was the most common kidney disease in PWH before ART became available. Animal 
models and human biopsy studies established the causal relationships between 
direct HIV-1 infection of renal epithelial cells and HIVAN, expression of viral 
genes in renal epithelial cells, and dysregulation of host genes involved in 
cell differentiation and cell cycle. In this review, we provide a summary of the 
body of work demonstrating HIV-1 infection of epithelial cells in the kidney and 
recent advancements in the understanding of viral entry mechanisms and 
consequences of HIV-1 gene expression in those cells.

Sequencing of B-cell and T-cell immune receptor repertoires helps us to 
understand the adaptive immune response, although it only provides information 
about the clonotypes (lineages) and their frequencies and not about, for 
example, their affinity or antigen (Ag) specificity. To further characterize the 
identified clones, usually with special attention to the particularly abundant 
ones (dominant), additional time-consuming or expensive experiments are 
generally required. Here, we present an extension of a multiscale model of the 
germinal center (GC) that we previously developed to gain more insight in B-cell 
repertoires. We compare the extent that these simulated repertoires deviate from 
experimental repertoires established from single GCs, blood, or tissue. Our 
simulations show that there is a limited correlation between clonal abundance 
and affinity and that there is large affinity variability among same-ancestor 
(same-clone) subclones. Our simulations suggest that low-abundance clones and 
subclones, might also be of interest since they may have high affinity for the 
Ag. We show that the fraction of plasma cells (PCs) with high B-cell receptor 
(BcR) mRNA content in the GC does not significantly affect the number of 
dominant clones derived from single GCs by sequencing BcR mRNAs. Results from 
these simulations guide data interpretation and the design of follow-up 
experiments.

OBJECTIVE: Point-of-care-testing (POCT) for HIV at community pharmacies can 
enhance care linkage compared with self-tests and increase testing uptake 
relative to standard lab testing. While the higher test uptake may increase 
testing costs, timely diagnosis and treatment can reduce downstream HIV 
treatment costs and improve health outcomes. This study provides the first 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-led POCT vs. HIV self-testing 
and standard lab testing.
DESIGN: Dynamic transmission model.
METHODS: We compared three HIV testing strategies: POCT at community pharmacies; 
self-testing using HIV self-test kits; and standard lab testing. Analyses were 
conducted from the Canadian health system perspective over a 30-year time 
horizon for all individuals aged 15-64 years in Canada. Costs were measured in 
2021 Canadian dollars and effectiveness was captured using quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Compared with standard lab testing, POCT at community pharmacies would 
save $885 million in testing costs over 30 years. Though antiretroviral 
treatment costs would increase by $190 million with POCT as more persons living 
with HIV are identified and treated, these additional costs would be partly 
offset by their lower downstream healthcare utilization (savings of $150 
million). POCT at community pharmacies would also yield over 5000 additional 
QALYs. Compared with HIV self-testing, POCT at community pharmacies would 
generate both higher costs and higher QALYs and would be cost-effective with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $47 475 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering POCT at community pharmacies can generate substantial cost 
savings and improve health outcomes compared with standard lab testing. It would 
also be cost-effective vs. HIV self-testing.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The introduction of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
vaccines urged all Thais to seek prevention of serious illness and death from 
COVID-19. However, immunocompromised individuals might not be able to achieve an 
efficient immune response from these vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing Evusheld (tixagevimab plus 
cilgavimab) for three patient groups-organ transplant, autoimmune disease, and 
dialysis patients, from the Thai government perspective.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to compare the use of Evusheld 
plus COVID-19 vaccines versus COVID-19 vaccines alone. The methodology followed 
the National HTA Guidelines of Thailand. Model input parameters were collected 
locally from retrospective data and from a literature review.
RESULTS: Evusheld helped prevent COVID-19 infection, severe infection, and death 
in all three patient groups. Using the Thai threshold of 160,000 Thai Baht (THB) 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, the only scenario found to be 
cost-effective was that of dialysis patients with inadequate immune response, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 54,700 THB per QALY 
gained. To make a policy of Evusheld provision cost-effective in other groups, 
the price of Evusheld had to be lower (a reduction of 44-88% of its current 
price). The results of one-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the 
cost-effectiveness of Evusheld was sensitive to changes in the rate of 
infection, cost and efficacy of Evusheld, proportion of inadequate immune 
responses, and the probability of moving from a 'recovered' to 'susceptible' 
status.
CONCLUSION: Among three COVID-19-vaccinated immunocompromised patient 
populations, this study concluded that Evusheld was cost-effective for dialysis 
patients with inadequate immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine.

Elucidating the genetic basis of local adaption is one of the important tasks in 
evolutionary biology. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has the highest biodiversity for 
an extreme environment worldwide, and provides an ideal natural laboratory to 
study adaptive evolution. The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, is 
one of the most devastating pests of the global Brassica industry. A highly 
heterozygous genome of this pest has facilitated its adaptation to a variety of 
complex environments, and so provides an ideal model to study fast adaptation. 
We conducted a pilot study combining RNA-seq with an age-stage, two-sex life 
table to study the effects of oxygen deprivation on DBM. The developmental 
periods of all instars were significantly shorter in the hypoxic environment. We 
compared the transcriptomes of DBM from Fuzhou, Fujian (low-altitude) and Lhasa, 
Tibet (high-altitude) under hypoxia treatment in a hypoxic chamber. Some DEGs 
are enriched in pathways associated with DNA replication, such as DNA repair, 
nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair and homologous 
recombination. The pathways with significant changes were associated with 
metabolism process and cell development. Thus, we assumed that insects could 
adapt to different environments by regulating their metabolism. Our findings 
indicated that although adaptive mechanisms to hypoxia in different DBM strains 
could be similar, DBM individuals from Tibet had superior tolerance to hypoxia 
compared with those of Fuzhou. Local adaptation of the Tibetan colony was 
assumed to be responsible for this difference. Our research suggests novel 
mechanisms of insect responses to hypoxia stress.

To our knowledge, we report the first population-based period life table, the 
expected lifetime survival for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with sickle 
cell disease (SCD), and the disparities in survival by insurance types in the 
United States. We constructed a retrospective cohort of individuals with 
diagnosed SCD receiving common care (any real-world patterns of care except 
transplant) based on nationwide Medicare and Medicaid claim data (2008-2016), 
covering beneficiaries in all 50 states. We analyzed lifetime survival 
probabilities using Kaplan-Meier curves and projected life expectancies at 
various ages for all, stratified by sex and insurance types. Our analysis 
included 94 616 individuals with SCD that have not undergone any transplant. 
Life expectancy at birth was 52.6 years (95% confidence interval: 51.9-53.4). 
Compared with the adults covered by Medicaid only, those covered by Medicare for 
disabilities or end-stage renal disease and those dually insured by Medicare and 
Medicaid had significantly worse life expectancy. Similarly, for beneficiaries 
aged ≥65 years, these 2 insurance types were associated with significantly 
shorter life expectancy than those enrolled in Medicare old age and survivor's 
insurance. Our study underscores the persistent life expectancy shortfall for 
patients with SCD, the burden of premature mortality during adulthood, and 
survival disparities by insurance status.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Approximately 38 million people worldwide experience 
heart failure (HF), with more than 10 million in China. Heart failure 
exacerbations are the main cause of HF hospitalization, and hospitalizations are 
the main driver of HF-associated costs. Vericiguat is recommended to treat 
patients who have had worsening HF despite guideline-directed medical therapy. 
However, the cost effectiveness of adding vericiguat to the standard treatment 
of this population in China remains unclear. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the cost effectiveness of adding vericiguat to standard treatment in 
patients with HF in the Chinese population METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with 
a 1-month cycle length was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of 
vericiguat plus standard treatment versus standard treatment alone in Chinese 
patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction following an HF exacerbation, 
from the perspective of Chinese healthcare providers. The clinical data were 
obtained from the VICTORIA study. The cost was accessed from our institution or 
studies conducted in China. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, representing incremental cost per incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Vericiguat was considered highly cost 
effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio obtained was lower than 
12,551 USD/QALY, cost effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
between 12,551 and 37,654.5 USD/QALY, and not cost effective if the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was higher than 37,654.5 USD/QALY. A scenario analysis, 
one-way sensitivity analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: For a 67-year-old patient with HF following an HF exacerbation, the 
lifetime cost was 17,721 USD if vericiguat plus standard treatment was given, 
compared to 7907 USD if standard treatment alone was prescribed. The 
corresponding effectiveness was 2.20 QALY and 2.10 QALY, respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vericiguat plus standard treatment 
versus standard treatment alone in Chinese patients with HF was 89,429 USD/QALY, 
higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold of 37654.5 USD/QALY. The scenario 
analysis and sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of our results.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of vericiguat to the treatment regimen of Chinese 
patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction following an HF exacerbation 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $89,429 USD/QALY compared 
to standard treatment. This incremental cost-effectiveness ratio exceeds the 
willingness-to-pay threshold and thus, vericiguat was deemed not cost effective 
in the Chinese population.

Actomyosin (actin-myosin II complex)-mediated contractile forces are central to 
the generation of multifaceted uni- and multi-cellular material properties and 
dynamics such as cell division, migration, and tissue morphogenesis. In the 
present article, we summarize our recent researches addressing molecular 
mechanisms that ensure actomyosin-mediated directional cell-cell junction 
remodeling, either shortening or extension, driving cell rearrangement for 
epithelial morphogenesis. Genetic perturbation clarified two points concerning 
cell-cell junction remodeling: an inhibitory mechanism against negative feedback 
in which actomyosin contractile forces, which are well known to induce cell-cell 
junction shortening, can concomitantly alter actin dynamics, oppositely leading 
to perturbation of the shortening; and tricellular junctions as a point that 
organizes extension of new cell-cell junctions after shortening. These findings 
highlight the notion that cells develop underpinning mechanisms to transform the 
multi-tasking property of actomyosin contractile forces into specific and proper 
cellular dynamics in space and time.

CONTEXT: After anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), athletes 
commonly undergo prolonged rehabilitation (eg, 9-12 months), but few actually 
return to preinjury sports activities. The nature (composition, configuration) 
of an ACL rehabilitation program (ACL-RP) is an important factor in determining 
rehabilitation outcomes; however, details about the nature of ACL-RPs are 
reported inconsistently in research studies. To guide future research reporting 
to support clinical translation and implementation of ACL-RPs, it is necessary 
to describe the nature, reporting, and outcomes of ACL-RPs in the current 
literature.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to understand the nature and 
reporting of various ACL-RPs that address musculoskeletal, biomechanical, 
functional, or patient-reported outcome measures in adult and pediatric athletes 
with ACLR.
DATA SOURCES: Articles were selected from searches in 5 electronic databases 
(PubMed, EbscoHost [MEDLINE, SportDiscus, CINAHL Plus], PROQuest, Cochrane, and 
Embase).
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they evaluated a post-ACL-RP that 
implemented strength, balance, plyometric, change of direction running, and/or 
agility running and included self-reported physical function, quality of life, 
or pain outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Scoping review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and synthesized to evaluate the reporting 
of acute program variables (APVs) and exercise descriptors (EDs); 17 studies 
were included in the final synthesis.
RESULTS: Studies reported between 0% and 67% of the APVs and EDs combined. Only 
2 studies were considered to have adequate reporting of both APVs and EDs.
CONCLUSION: Inadequate reporting of APVs and EDs in past studies restricts the 
translation and implementation of existing research-based ACL-RPs to present-day 
clinical contexts.

AIMS: To estimate the health utilities and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) receiving reldesemtiv 
versus placebo in FORTITUDE-ALS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of clinical trial data 
from FORTITUDE-ALS (NCT03160898). This Phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, 
dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week trial evaluated 
reldesemtiv in patients with ALS. Health utilities from the five-level version 
of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) were estimated using 
ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores collected during the 
trial. QALYs were estimated using the area under the curve method.
RESULTS: The full analysis set consisted of 456 patients (reldesemtiv n = 342, 
placebo n = 114), who received at least one dose of the double-blind study drug, 
and had ALSFRS-R assessed at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
The difference in EQ-5D-5L utility least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline 
to week 12 for reldesemtiv versus placebo, adjusted for baseline values, was 
statistically significant (0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01, 0.05; p = 
.0008). The incremental QALY of reldesemtiv versus placebo adjusted for baseline 
utility values showed a modest, but statistically significant, difference 
(0.004, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.007; p = .0058).
CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis of FORTITUDE-ALS suggests that reldesemtiv 
showed a modest but significant benefit in health utilities and QALYs compared 
with placebo. Future long-term studies that include direct collection of 
EQ-5D-5L data will be needed to confirm our findings.

There is increasing evidence that thyroid hormones (THs) work in an integrative 
fashion with androgen receptors (ARs) to regulate gonadal differentiation and 
reproductive function. Studies reveal that THs have interactions with the AR 
promoter region and increase AR expression. THs also have a role in the 
regulation of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of androgens, such as 
5α-reductase, which is essential in the conversion of testosterone into its 
active form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Additionally, the presence of androgen 
response elements in the promoter regions of TH-related genes, such as 
deiodinases and TH receptor isoforms, has been identified in some vertebrates, 
indicating a mutual interaction between THs and ARs. Since the androgen 
signaling pathway, mediated by ARs, plays a key role in the formation and 
progression of prostate cancer (PCa), the existence of crosstalk between THs and 
ARs supports the epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicating a 
relationship between the high incidence of PCa and hyperthyroidism. This article 
aims to review the role of androgen-TH crosstalk in PCa and its implication in 
clinical management. As life expectancy is growing these days, it can increase 
the number of patients with PCa and the critical relevance of the disease. In 
order to gain better knowledge about PCa and to improve clinical management, it 
is essential to get better insight into the key factors related to the formation 
and progression of this cancer.

Site-directed and saturation mutagenesis are critical DNA methodologies for 
studying protein structure and function. For plasmid-based gene mutation, PCR 
and overlap-extension PCR involve tedious cloning steps. When the plasmid size 
is large, PCR yield may be too low for cloning; and for saturation mutagenesis 
of a single codon, one experiment may not enough to generate all twenty coding 
variants. Oligo-mediated recombineering sidesteps the complicated cloning 
process by homologous recombination between a mutagenic oligo and its target 
site. However, the low recombineering efficiency and inability to select for the 
recombinant makes it necessary to screen a large number of clones. Herein, we 
describe two plasmid-based mutagenic strategies: CRISPR/Cas9-assisted ssDNA 
recombineering for site-directed mutagenesis (CRM) and saturation mutagenesis 
(CRSM). CRM and CRSM involve co-electroporation of target plasmid, sgRNA 
expression plasmid and mutagenic oligonucleotide into Escherichia coli cells 
with induced expression of λ-Red recombinase and Cas9, followed by plasmid 
extraction and characterization. We established CRM and CRSM via ampicillin 
resistance gene repair and mutagenesis of N-acetyl‑D‑neuraminic acid aldolase. 
The mutational efficiency was between 80 and 100% and all twenty amino acid 
coding variants were obtained at a target site via a single CRSM strategy. CRM 
and CRSM have the potential to be general plasmid-based gene mutagenesis tools.

The field of malignant hematology is transforming with novel immunotherapeutic 
approaches. Unfortunately, quality of life, treatment efficacy, and life 
expectancy are negatively affected by cardiotoxic side effects of treatment. To 
date, the exact mechanism and incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with these 
therapies is unclear. These events are believed to be triggered or occur 
concurrently with cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, there are no formal 
guidelines to provide evaluation, treatment, and surveillance. We aim to 
synthesize available literature with updates on the cardiotoxic effects of novel 
therapies used in malignant hematologic disorders, with a focus on chimeric 
antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell engager therapy, along 
with a proposed algorithm that may guide pretreatment evaluation, monitoring 
during treatment, and post-treatment surveillance.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to estimate the nationwide prevalence of potentially 
inappropriate medication (PIM) use in patients with terminal cancer according to 
two deprescribing criteria for patients with a limited lifespan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of 
PIM use using two datasets: national claims data and single-tertiary hospital 
data. In the claims data, patients with terminal cancer were defined as patients 
with cancers who died between April and June 2018 and were prescribed opioid 
analgesics or megestrol or were hospitalized for >90 days before the date of 
death. Using hospital data, patients who were enrolled in hospice care in 2019 
were identified. PIM was defined according to the adjusted criteria from the 
Screening Tool for Older Persons' Prescriptions in frail adults with limited 
life expectancy (STOPPFrail) versions 1 and 2 and oncological palliative care 
deprescribing guidelines (OncPal) guidelines.
RESULTS: From the national claims data and single-tertiary hospital data, 1,558 
patients and 1,243 patients were included in the analysis, respectively. In both 
datasets, over 60% of patients used five or more medications (claims data: 
67.7%; hospital data: 63.9%), and approximately half of them used at least one 
PIM (claims data: 51.5%; hospital data: 43.2%). Lipid-lowering agents, acid 
suppressors, and hypoglycemics were common PIMs. Polypharmacy, age, and comorbid 
conditions, including diabetes, were associated with PIM use.
DISCUSSION: Approximately two-thirds and half of the patients with terminal 
cancer were exposed to polypharmacy and at least one PIM based on the STOPPFrail 
and OncPal criteria, respectively; therefore, deprescribing PIM in patients with 
terminal cancer is an urgent issue.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the characteristics of the global death burden imposed by 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the attributable risk factors from 1990 to 2019 
to help inform a framework for policy discussions, resource allocation and 
research priorities.
DESIGN: A population-based observational study.
SETTING: The death data and relative risk factors were obtained from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 database.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Based on the GBD database, we estimated the death burden 
attributable to CKD stratified by sociodemographic index (SDI), geographic 
location, sex, age group, time period and risk factors from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Over three decade study period, the global number of CKD-related deaths 
increased from 0.60 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 0.57-0.63 million) 
in 1990 to 1.43 million (95% UI: 1.31-1.52 million) in 2019. The 
age-standardised death rate (ASDR) of CKD, among all causes, increased from 15th 
in 1990 to 10th in 2019. Globally, the ASDR in males was higher than that in 
females. CKD-related deaths mainly occurred in those aged over 50 years, 
especially in regions with higher SDIs. The ASDR was negatively related to SDI 
(ρ=-0.603, p<0.0001). Among risk factors, metabolic risk factors, especially 
systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and body mass index, were the 
main contributors to CKD-related deaths. Although the high-temperature-related 
death burden was low, the trend increased sharply in lower SDI regions.
CONCLUSIONS: CKD-related deaths continue to increase, with the majority 
occurring in elderly adults. The CKD-related death burden is higher in males 
than in females. Additionally, the increasing high-temperature-related death 
burdens in lower SDI regions should receive social attention.

BACKGROUND: As mental health in adulthood is related to mental status during 
adolescence, school-based interventions have been proposed to improve 
resilience. The objective of this study was to build a simulation model 
representing the natural history of mental disorders in childhood, adolescence 
and youth to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the UPRIGHT school-based 
intervention in promoting resilience and mental health in adolescence.
METHODS: We built a discrete event simulation model fed with real-world data 
(cumulative incidence disaggregated into eight clusters) from the Basque Health 
Service database (609,381 individuals) to calculate utilities (quality-adjusted 
life years [QALYs]) and costs for the general population in two scenarios (base 
case and intervention). The model translated changes in the wellbeing of 
adolescents into different risks of mental illnesses for a time horizon of 
30 years.
RESULTS: The number of cases of anxiety was estimated to fall by 5,125 or 9,592 
and those of depression by 1,269 and 2,165 if the effect of the intervention 
lasted 2 or 5 years respectively. From a healthcare system perspective, the 
intervention was cost-effective for all cases considered with incremental 
cost-utility ratios always lower than €10,000/QALY and dominant for some 
subgroups. The intervention was always dominant when including indirect and 
non-medical costs (societal perspective).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis of the trial did not did not detect 
significant differences, the UPRIGHT intervention promoting positive mental 
health was dominant in the economic evaluation from the societal perspective. 
Promoting resilience was more cost-effective in the most deprived group. Despite 
a lack of information about the spillover effect in some sectors, the economic 
evaluation framework developed principally for pharmacoeconomics can be applied 
to interventions to promote resilience in adolescents. As prevention of mental 
health disorders is even more necessary in the post-coronavirus disease-19 era, 
such evaluation is essential to assess whether investment in mental health 
promotion would be good value for money by avoiding costs for healthcare 
providers and other stakeholders.
