from hospital transport to the emergency department (ED), to the operating room 
and intensive care unit (ICU).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The burden of sTBI is highest in RLRs. As working-age 
adults are the predominantly affected age-group, an increase in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) generates a loss of economic growth in 
regions where economic growth is needed most. Four multi-institutional 
collaborations between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs have developed 
evidence and consensus-based documents focused on capacity building for sTBI 
care as a means of addressing this substantial burden of disease.

INTRODUCTION: β-thalassemia is one of the most common inherited monogenic 
diseases. Many patients are dependent on a lifetime of red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions and iron chelation therapy. Although treatments have a significant 
impact on quality of life (QoL), life expectancy, and long-term health outcomes 
have improved in recent decades through safer RBC transfusion practices and 
better iron chelation strategies. Advances in the understanding of the pathology 
of β-thalassemia have led to the development of new treatment options that have 
the potential to reduce the RBC transfusion burden in patients with 
transfusion-dependent (TD) β-thalassemia and improve QoL.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of currently available 
treatments for patients with TD β-thalassemia, highlighting QoL issues, and 
providing an update on current clinical experience plus important practical 
points for two new treatments available for TD β-thalassemia: betibeglogene 
autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy and the erythroid maturation agent 
luspatercept, an activin ligand trap.
EXPERT OPINION: Approved therapies, including curative gene therapies and 
supportive treatments such as luspatercept, have the potential to reduce RBC 
transfusion burden, and improve clinical outcomes and QoL in patients with TD 
β-thalassemia. Cost of treatment is, however, likely to be a significant barrier 
for payors and patients.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the heterogeneous clinical profile of physical 
frailty and its association with cognitive impairment in older U.S. nursing home 
(NH) residents.
METHODS: Minimum Data Set 3.0 at admission was used to identify older adults 
newly-admitted to nursing homes with life expectancy ≥6 months and length of 
stay ≥100 days (n = 871,801). Latent class analysis was used to identify 
physical frailty subgroups, using FRAIL-NH items as indicators. The association 
between the identified physical frailty subgroups and cognitive impairment 
(measured by Brief Interview for Mental Status/Cognitive Performance Scale: 
none/mild; moderate; severe), adjusting for demographic and clinical 
characteristics, was estimated by multinomial logistic regression and presented 
in adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: In older nursing home residents at admission, three physical frailty 
subgroups were identified: "mild physical frailty" (prevalence: 7.6%), "moderate 
physical frailty" (44.5%) and "severe physical frailty" (47.9%). Those in 
"moderate physical frailty" or "severe physical frailty" had high probabilities 
of needing assistance in transferring between locations and inability to walk in 
a room. Residents in "severe physical frailty" also had greater probability of 
bowel incontinence. Compared to those with none/mild cognitive impairment, older 
residents with moderate or severe impairment had slightly higher odds of 
belonging to "moderate physical frailty" [aOR (95%CI)moderate cognitive 
impairment: 1.01 (0.99-1.03); aOR (95%CI)severe cognitive impairment: 1.03 
(1.01-1.05)] and much higher odds to the "severe physical frailty" subgroup [aOR 
(95%CI)moderate cognitive impairment: 2.41 (2.35-2.47); aOR (95%CI)severe 
cognitive impairment: 5.74 (5.58-5.90)].
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate the heterogeneous presentations of physical 
frailty in older nursing home residents and additional evidence on the 
interrelationship between physical frailty and cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: In the context of demographic aging, active aging must be 
encouraged. In addition, the increase in life expectancy requires specific care 
for the elderly. Therefore, it is important to ensure appropriate training and 
education to caregivers. Educational institutions put value in positively 
influencing the attitudes and behaviours towards elderly people in order to 
ensure the quality of patient care in the future. Questionnaires are often used 
to assess attitudes. Among them, the University of California, Los Angeles 
Geriatrics Attitudes Scale (UCLA-GAS) was developed to assess attitudes towards 
older people and caring for older patients. This scale has been used to evaluate 
attitude of healthcare professionals and students including undergraduate 
physiotherapy students. To our knowledge, there is no scale that assesses the 
same concept in French. Therefore, this study aimed to translate and adapt the 
UCLA-GAS into French and to test its psychometric properties.
METHODS: We conducted this study in two phases. First, we translated and adapted 
the UCLA-GAS from English into French following the five recommended stages of 
cross-cultural adaptation. Second, we validated the French version of the scale 
with undergraduate physiotherapy students. One hundred nineteen students 
participated from the first to the third academic years. We estimated 
reliability and validity of the scale. We performed correlation analyses between 
the French version of the UCLA-GAS (UCLA-GAS-F) with the Aging Stereotypes and 
Exercise Scale (ASES) and the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ).
RESULTS: The scale was translated and adapted into French. Results of the 
validation phase showed that the UCLA-GAS-F had high test-retest reliability 
(ICC 0.83, 95%CI 0.74-0.89), but internal consistency below 0.7 (Cronbach's 
alpha 0.49 to 0.57). The scale showed no ceiling or floor effect. As expected, 
the French version showed a weak correlation to the ASES (r = 0.28, p = .003) 
and to the AAQ (r = 0.32, p = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite low internal consistency, the French version of the 
UCLA-GAS showed appropriate psychometric properties. Further validation should 
include healthcare professionals and other healthcare students.

Life expectancy globally increased in the last decades: the number of people 
aged 65 or older is consequently projected to grow, and healthcare demand will 
increase as well. In the recent years, the number of patients visiting the 
hospital emergency departments (EDs) rocked in almost all countries of the 
world. These departments are crucial in all healthcare systems and play a 
critical role in providing an efficient assistance to all patients. A systematic 
literature review covering PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library was performed 
from 2009 to 2019. Of the 718 references found in the literature research, more 
than 25 studies were included in the current review. Different predictors were 
associated with the quality of EDs care, which may help to define and implement 
preventive strategies in the near future. There is no harmonisation in 
efficiency measurements reflecting the performance in the ED setting. The 
identification of consistent measures of efficiency is crucial to build an 
evidence base for future initiatives. The aim of this study is to review the 
literature on the problems encountered in the efficiency of EDs around the world 
in order to identify an organisational model or guidelines that can be 
implemented in EDs to fill inefficiencies and ensure access optimal treatment 
both in terms of resources and timing. This review will support policy makers to 
improve the quality of health facilities, and, consequently of the entire 
healthcare systems.

Although calorie restriction has been reported to extend lifespan in several 
organisms, animals subjected to calorie restriction consume not only fewer 
calories but also smaller quantities of food. Whether it is the overall 
restriction of calories or the coincidental reduction in the quantity of food 
consumed that mediates the anti-aging effects is unclear. Here, we subjected 
mice to five dietary interventions. We showed that both calorie and quantity 
restriction could improve early survival, but no maximum lifespan extension was 
observed in the mice fed isocaloric diet in which food quantity was reduced. 
Mice fed isoquant diet with fewer calories showed maximum lifespan extension and 
improved health among all the groups, suggesting that calorie intake rather than 
food quantity consumed is the key factor for the anti-aging effect of calorie 
restriction. Midlife liver gene expression correlations with lifespan revealed 
that calorie restriction raised fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism and 
biosynthesis of amino acids but inhibited carbon metabolism, indicating 
different effects on fatty acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Our data 
illustrate the effects of calories and food quantity on the lifespan extension 
by calorie restriction and their potential mechanisms, which will provide 
guidance on the application of calorie restriction to humans.

Despite COVID-19's significant morbidity and mortality, considering 
cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment strategies for hospitalized 
patients remains critical to support healthcare resource decisions within 
budgetary constraints. As such, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of using 
remdesivir and dexamethasone for moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory 
infections using the United States health care system as a representative model. 
A decision analytic model modelled a base case scenario of a 60-year-old patient 
admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Patients requiring oxygen were considered 
moderate severity, and patients with severe COVID-19 required intubation with 
intensive care. Strategies modelled included giving remdesivir to all patients, 
remdesivir in only moderate and only severe infections, dexamethasone to all 
patients, dexamethasone in severe infections, remdesivir in 
moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections, and best supportive care. Data for 
the model came from the published literature. The time horizon was 1 year; no 
discounting was performed due to the short duration. The perspective was of the 
payer in the United States health care system. Supportive care for 
moderate/severe COVID-19 cost $11,112.98 with 0.7155 quality adjusted life-year 
(QALY) obtained. Using dexamethasone for all patients was the most-cost 
effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $980.84/QALY; all 
remdesivir strategies were more costly and less effective. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses showed dexamethasone for all patients was most 
cost-effective in 98.3% of scenarios. Dexamethasone for moderate-severe COVID-19 
infections was the most cost-effective strategy and would have minimal budget 
impact. Based on current data, remdesivir is unlikely to be a cost-effective 
treatment for COVID-19.

As the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) approaches that of the 
general population, the burden of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is increasing. Regardless of HIV status, about 50% of CVD deaths worldwide 
occur in Asia, and Asian PLWH have a high prevalence of conventional CVD risk 
factors, such as smoking, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and insulin resistance or 
diabetes. As well as conventional CVD risk factors, PLWH have HIV-specific risk 
factors such as chronic inflammation, immune activation and endothelial damage, 
as well as risk factors related to antiretroviral therapy. This review describes 
the current knowledge on the epidemiology and risk factors of CVD in Asian PLWH 
and provides an Asian perspective on the recommendations for managing CVD risk 
in PLWH.

    JAMA Dermatol. 2021 Oct 1;157(10):1161-1162.

IMPORTANCE: Few studies have examined watchful waiting (WW) in patients with 
basal cell carcinoma (BCC), although this approach might be suitable in patients 
who might not live long enough to benefit from treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reasons for WW and to document the natural course of BCC 
in patients who chose WW and reasons to initiate later treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational cohort study was performed 
at a single institution between January 2018 and November 2020 studying patients 
with 1 or more untreated BCC for 3 months or longer.
EXPOSURES: Watchful waiting was chosen by patients and proxies regardless of 
this study.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The reasons for WW and treatment were extracted from 
patient files and were categorized for analyses. Linear mixed models were used 
to estimate tumor growth and identify covariates associated with tumor growth.
RESULTS: Watchful waiting was chosen for 280 BCCs in 89 patients (47 men [53%] 
and 42 women [47%]), with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up of 9 
(4-15) months. The median (IQR) age of the included patients was 83 (73-88) 
years. Patient-related factors or preferences (ie, prioritizations of 
comorbidities, severe frailty, or limited life expectancy) were reasons to 
initiate WW in 74 (83%) patients, followed by tumor-related factors (n = 49; 
55%). Treatment-related and circumstantial reasons were important for 35% and 
46% of the patients, respectively. The minority of tumors increased in size 
(47%). Tumor growth was associated with BCC subtype (odds ratio, 3.35; 95% CI, 
1.47-7.96; P = .005), but not with initial tumor size and location. The 
estimated tumor diameter increase was 4.46 mm (80% prediction interval, 1.42 to 
7.46 mm) in 1 year for BCCs containing at least an infiltrative/micronodular 
component and 1.06 mm (80% prediction interval, -1.79 to 4.28 mm) for the 
remaining BCCs (only nodular/superficial component/clinical diagnosis). Most 
common reasons to initiate treatment were tumor burden or potential tumor 
burden, resolved reason(s) for WW, and reevaluation of patient-related factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with BCC, WW was an 
appropriate approach in several patients, especially those with asymptomatic 
nodular or superficial BCCs and a limited life expectancy. Patients should be 
followed up regularly to determine whether a WW approach is still suitable and 
whether patients still prefer WW and to reconsider consequences of treatment and 
refraining from treatment.

The generalized risk-adjusted cost-effectiveness (GRACE) model generalizes 
conventional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) by introducing diminishing 
returns to Health-Related Quality of Life (QoL). This changes CEA practice in 
three ways: (1) Willingness to pay (WTP) increases exponentially with untreated 
illness severity or pre-existing permanent disability, and WTP ends up lower for 
mild diseases but higher for severe diseases compared with conventional CEA; (2) 
Average treatment effectiveness should be adjusted for uncertainty in outcomes; 
and (3) The marginal rate of substitution between life expectancy and QoL varies 
with health state. Implementing GRACE requires new parameters describing risk 
preferences over QoL, the marginal rate of substitution between life expectancy 
(LE) and QoL, and the variance and skewness of treatment outcomes distributions. 
In this paper, we provide: (1) a generalized WTP threshold incorporating the 
possibility of permanent disability; (2) a simpler method to estimate the 
tradeoff rate between QoL and LE, eliminating the need to carry out 
treatment-by-treatment estimates; (3) a more-general method to adjust WTP for 
illness severity that permits non-constant relative risk-aversion in QoL; (4) a 
new approach to estimating risk-preferences over QoL, leveraging established 
empirical methods from "happiness" economics; and (5) a step-by-step guide for 
practitioners wishing to implement multi-period GRACE analyses.

Researchers and policy makers in the US are exploring the implementation of 
health technology assessment and value-based pricing to negotiate drug prices 
and limit spending. Objections made to the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 
the most frequently used health economic outcome for such assessments, are a 
barrier to the adoption of these tools. This literature review identifies and 
addresses the range of criticisms made against QALYs. Methods-based criticisms 
require attention from stakeholders to address well-known shortcomings of the 
QALY and ensure consistency. Ethical criticisms, however, do not apply only to 
the QALY and require political decisions about societal values. Understanding 
and overcoming criticisms of the QALY to enable its use as part of health 
technology assessment and value-based pricing will be crucial as US policy 
makers seek to address high drug costs and health care spending.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) and dementia are 
common stroke outcomes, with significant health and societal implications for 
aging populations. These outcomes are not included in current epidemiological 
models. We aimed to develop an epidemiological model to project incidence and 
prevalence of stroke, poststroke CIND and dementia, and life expectancy, in 
Ireland to 2035, informing policy and service planning.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model (the StrokeCog model) applied 
to the Irish population aged 40 to 89 years to 2035. Data sources included 
official population and hospital-episode statistics, longitudinal cohort 
studies, and published estimates. Key assumptions were varied in sensitivity 
analysis. Results were externally validated against independent sources. The 
model tracks poststroke progression into health states characterized by no 
cognitive impairment, CIND, dementia, disability, stroke recurrence, and death.
RESULTS: We projected 69 051 people with prevalent stroke in Ireland in 2035 
(22.0 per 1000 population [95% CI, 20.8-23.1]), with 25 274 (8.0 per 1000 
population [95% CI, 7.1-9.0]) of those projected to have poststroke CIND, and 
12 442 having poststroke dementia (4.0 per 1000 population [95% CI, 3.2-4.8]). 
We projected 8725 annual incident strokes in 2035 (2.8 per 1000 population [95% 
CI, 2.7-2.9]), with 3832 of these having CIND (1.2 per 1000 population [95% CI, 
1.1-1.3]), and 1715 with dementia (0.5 per 1000 population [95% CI, 0.5-0.6]). 
Life expectancy for stroke survivors at age 50 was 23.4 years (95% CI, 
22.3-24.5) for women and 20.7 (95% CI, 19.5-21.9) for men.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel epidemiological model of stroke, poststroke CIND, and 
dementia draws on the best available evidence. Sensitivity analysis indicated 
that findings were robust to assumptions, and where there was uncertainty a 
conservative approach was taken. The StrokeCog model is a useful tool for 
service planning and cost-effectiveness analysis and is available for adaptation 
to other national contexts.

BACKGROUND: Systematic screening for active tuberculosis (TB) is a strategy 
which requires the health system to seek out individuals, rather than waiting 
for individuals to self-present with symptoms (i.e., passive case finding). Our 
review aimed to summarize the current economic evidence and understand the costs 
and cost-effectiveness of systematic screening approaches among high-risk groups 
and settings.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on economic evaluations of screening 
for TB disease targeting persons with clinical and/or structural risk factors, 
such as persons living with HIV (PLHIV) or persons experiencing homelessness. We 
searched three databases for studies published between January 1, 2010 and 
February 1, 2020. Studies were included if they reported cost and a key outcome 
measure. Owing to considerable heterogeneity in settings and type of screening 
strategy, we synthesized data descriptively.
RESULTS: A total of 27 articles were included in our review; 19/27 (70%) took 
place in high TB burden countries. Seventeen studies took place among persons 
with clinical risk factors, including 14 among PLHIV, while 13 studies were 
among persons with structural risk factors. Nine studies reported incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from US$51 to $1980 per 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Screening was most cost-effective 
among PLHIV. Among persons with clinical and structural risk factors there was 
limited evidence, but screening was generally not shown to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies showed that screening is most likely to be cost-effective 
in a high TB prevalence population. Our review highlights that to reach the 
"missing millions" TB programmes should focus on simple, cheaper initial 
screening tools (i.e., symptom screen and CXR) followed by molecular diagnostic 
tools (i.e., Xpert®) among the highest risk groups in the local setting (i.e., 
PLHIV, urban slums). Programmatic costs greatly impact cost-effectiveness thus 
future research should provide both fixed and variable costs of screening 
interventions to improve comparability.

[What is the best treatment for chronic-phase CML?].

[Article in Japanese]

Hospital.

The chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) therapeutic landscape has dramatically 
changed with the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which allows 
for a near-normal life expectancy. Five TKIs have been currently approved for 
CML treatment in Japan, of which four have been indicated as first-line therapy 
(i.e., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib). Nowadays, the long-term 
prognosis of patients with CML is determined not by the primary disease but 
rather by the comorbidities and treatment-related adverse events (AEs), 
including cardiovascular events. Assessment of risk profile and comorbidities at 
diagnosis is essential for the appropriate choice of TKI and long-term survival 
management. The ability of some patients who achieve deep molecular responses to 
discontinue therapy successfully is well documented. Long-term treatment-free 
remission with continued response to TKI therapy is now recognized as the most 
optimal treatment benefit for some patients.This article discusses treatment 
strategies, AE management, and future perspectives based on the latest CML 
treatment guidelines.

University of Tokyo.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) harboring a leukemia-related mutation has been 
recently found in about 10% of healthy elderly individuals, which has been 
attracting attention. Although most people with CH do not develop hematological 
malignancies, some may develop hematological malignancies 10 times more 
frequently than age-matched controls. On the other hand, compared to age-matched 
controls, the probability of developing cardiovascular diseases in people with 
CH is 2-fold, which is thought to shorten the life expectancy. Moreover, one out 
of four patients with solid cancer and one out of two patients with aplastic 
anemia, whose mutation profiles overlap with but are distinct from common 
mutations identified with CH of elderly people, harbor CH. The study of CH has 
just begun, and there are many unknowns. In an aging society of unprecedented 
proportions, which is also attracting attention from the society, the 
establishment of a new research field that investigates CH in the near future is 
likely.

In a biologic therapeutic landscape that requires versatility in targeting 
specificity, valency and half-life modulation, the monomeric Fc fusion platform 
holds exciting potential for the creation of a class of monovalent protein 
therapeutics that includes fusion proteins and bispecific targeting molecules. 
Here we report a structure-guided approach to engineer monomeric Fc molecules to 
adapt multiple versions of half-life extension modifications. Co-crystal 
structures of these monomeric Fc variants with Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) shed 
light into the binding interactions that could serve as a guide for engineering 
the half-life of antibody Fc fragments. These engineered monomeric Fc molecules 
also enabled the generation of a novel monovalent bispecific molecular design, 
which translated the FcRn binding enhancement to improvement of in vivo serum 
half-life.

Increase in the quality of life, combined with drug strategies, has been studied 
as possibilities for improving memory and delaying the onset of 
neurodegenerative diseases. A previous study published by the group of the 
authors has shown that microdose lithium and enriched environment can improve 
memory in both mice and humans. To elucidate this relationship better, this 
study aimed to evaluate whether the chronic combination of these two strategies 
could increase healthy aging in Senescence Accelerated Mouse-Prone 8 (SAMP8). 
Animals were submitted to either one or both of these strategies until the age 
of 10 months when they were anesthetized and killed and their hippocampus was 
extracted. The untreated SAMP-8 group exhibited worse memory and reduced 
neuronal density with greater neurodegeneration and increased amyloid-β plaque 
density compared with the control group. Moreover, significant alterations in 
proteins related to long-term potentiation, such as, synaptophysin and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were observed in this group. The 
strategies used in the study maintained long-term memory, reduced anxiety, and 
increased neuroprotection. Both strategies were efficient in reducing 
neurodegeneration and increasing parameters related to memory maintenance. In 
many experiments, the combination of the two strategies was more effective in 
improving healthy aging. This study sheds light on the combination of strategies 
that choose to improve the quality of life and drugs with low side effects. 
Moreover, it opens perspectives for a new field of study for healthy aging.

Backgsround: Infective endocarditis (IE) of prosthetic valves is a dire 
complication of cardiac valve replacement surgery and is associated with high 
rates of morbidity and mortality. Case Summary: A 72-year-old woman with 
multiple comorbidities underwent surgical replacement of the aortic valve with a 
mechanical prosthetic valve after recurrent IE. After 10 years, IE recurred and 
the mechanical valve was surgically replaced with a bioprosthetic valve. Ten 
years later, severe heart failure developed due to severe paravalvular leak 
(PVL) caused by an aortic annulus abscess complicated by a paravalvular 
pseudoaneurysm fistula (PPF). The patient was deemed at prohibitive surgical 
risk and a catheter-based PVL closure procedure was planned. However, the 
interventional procedure was delayed several months due to the Covid-19 pandemic 
with progressive heart failure worsening. Despite an acute satisfactory result 
of the PPF transcatheter closure and a significant clinical improvement, the 
patient died 10 months later due to multiorgan failure. It is likely that this 
was due, at least in part, to the long treatment delay caused by the 
unprecedented strain on the healthcare system. Discussion: In patients at high 
surgical risk, early diagnosis and prompt interventional treatment of severe PVL 
are crucial for improving expectancy and quality of life. However, the recent 
outbreak of COVID-19 caused deferral of elective and semi-elective structural 
heart disease procedures (SHD) as in our case. Thus, a proactive and vigilant 
stance on managing SHD should be a priority even in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Occupation-Based Life Expectancy: Actuarial Fairness in Determining Statutory 
Retirement Age.

Centers, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

This study examines occupation-based differences in life expectancy and the 
extent to which health accounts for these differences. Twentyseven-year survival 
follow-up data were used from the Dutch population-based Longitudinal Aging 
Study Amsterdam (n = 2,531), initial ages 55-85 years. Occupation was based on 
longest-held job. Results show that the non-skilled general, technical and 
transport domains had an up to 3.5-year shorter life expectancy than the 
academic professions, accounting for the compositional characteristics age and 
gender. Statutory retirement age could be made to vary accordingly, by allowing 
a proportionally greater pension build-up in the shorter-lived domains. Health 
accounted for a substantial portion of the longevity difference, ranging from 20 
to 66%, depending on the health indicator. Thus, health differences between 
occupational domains today can be used as a means to tailor retirement ages to 
individuals' risks of longevity. These data provide a proof of principle for the 
development of an actuarially fair method to determine statutory retirement 
ages.

The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files are widely used by the industry due 
to their flexibility in representing numerous kinds of data. Multiple 
applications such as financial records, social networks, and mobile networks use 
complex XML schemas with nested types, contents, and/or extension bases on 
existing complex elements or large real-world files. A great number of these 
files are generated each day and this has influenced the development of Big Data 
tools for their parsing and reporting, such as Apache Hive and Apache Spark. For 
these reasons, multiple studies have proposed new techniques and evaluated the 
processing of XML files with Big Data systems. However, a more usual approach in 
such works involves the simplest XML schemas, even though, real data sets are 
composed of complex schemas. Therefore, to shed light on complex XML schema 
processing for real-life applications with Big Data tools, we present an 
approach that combines three techniques. This comprises three main methods for 
parsing XML files: cataloging, deserialization, and positional explode. For 
cataloging, the elements of the XML schema are mapped into root, arrays, 
structures, values, and attributes. Based on these elements, the deserialization 
and positional explode are straightforwardly implemented. To demonstrate the 
validity of our proposal, we develop a case study by implementing a test 
environment to illustrate the methods using real data sets provided from 
performance management of two mobile network vendors. Our main results state the 
validity of the proposed method for different versions of Apache Hive and Apache 
Spark, obtain the query execution times for Apache Hive internal and external 
tables and Apache Spark data frames, and compare the query performance in Apache 
Hive with that of Apache Spark. Another contribution made is a case study in 
which a novel solution is proposed for data analysis in the performance 
management systems of mobile networks.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the feasibility and safety of an exercise 
intervention in patients with metastatic solid cancer.
METHODS: Patients scheduled to receive first-line chemotherapy for metastatic 
cancer with a life expectancy of ≥4 months, no brain metastases, and no high 
risk of fracture were recruited to participate in a 12-week, combined resistance 
and aerobic exercise program consisting of supervised, hospital-based (2×/week) 
and home-based training (3×/week) during palliative chemotherapy. Feasibility 
and safety of the exercise intervention were the primary outcomes. The secondary 
outcomes were skeletal muscle mass and strength, functional capacity, quality of 
life (QoL), and fatigue.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Five patients 
withdrew consent before the exercise intervention due to fear of exacerbating 
cancer-related symptoms (n=2), transportation issues (n=2), and unknown reasons 
(n=1). Ten patients (71.4%) completed the 12-week exercise program. Mean 
attendance rate of the supervised exercise sessions was 64.9% (range, 
16.7-95.8%). No adverse events or skeletal complications occurred during the 
supervised exercise sessions. Among participants, there were no significant 
changes in muscle area at the third lumbar level (mean change =-0.7 cm2, 
P=0.869) or appendicular skeletal muscle mass (mean change =0.1 kg, P=0.661).
