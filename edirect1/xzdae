BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders are associated with high morbidity and 
reduced life expectancy, and are largely managed in primary care. We sought to 
assess the equity of distribution of new alternative payment models and teams 
introduced under primary care reform in Ontario for patients with mental health 
disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study using population-level 
administrative data for insured Ontario adults (age ≥ 18 yr) to identify all 
primary care payments to physicians that were allocated to individual patients 
in 2002/03 and 2011/12. We identified patients with mental health disorders 
using validated algorithms, and modelled the relations between per capita 
primary care costs and mental health disorders over time, stratified by type of 
mental health or substance use disorder and type of primary care payment. In an 
adjusted model, we adjusted for age, sex, rurality, neighbourhood income 
quintile, immigrant status, comorbidity and primary care model. For comparative 
purposes, we also examined the distribution of primary care payments for people 
with diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: Total per capita primary care payments increased more slowly over the 
study period for patients with mental health disorders (62.0%) than for the 
general population (88.3%). Total payments for patients with substance use 
disorders increased by 142.7%, largely owing to urine drug testing in opioid 
substitution clinics. Adjusted total payments for those with versus without 
mental health disorders decreased by 10% between 2002/03 and 2011/12, driven by 
lower alternative payments. Similar decreases, also driven by lower alternative 
payments, were found for all mental health disorder subgroups except substance 
use and for diabetes.
INTERPRETATION: Payment and team reforms were associated with inequitable 
resource allocation to people with mental health disorders. The findings suggest 
the need for monitoring reforms for their impact on high-needs populations and 
making appropriate adjustments.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a seriously debilitating disease, which 
prevalence is growing in aging population becoming a substantial burden (BoD) to 
society.
AIM: To assess disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALE) lost by pain severity 
and usual analgesic treatment among OA adults 65 + year in Spain.
METHODS: The National Health Survey, a large, nationally representative, 
cross-sectional general health survey administered to 23,089 individuals was the 
data source. Data on subjects of 65 + years with a self-reported physician 
diagnosis of OA were analysed. Records were cross-classified by pain severity 
(no pain/mild pain, moderate pain and severe pain) and use of usual analgesics. 
DALE lost was used as a summary measure of BoD and expressed as both number of 
years of healthy life-expectancy lost due to disability and percentage of 
life-expectancy lost.
RESULTS: 3389 records were analysed [women 73.3%; age 77.4 (SD 7.5) years]. 
Older OA patients showed a mean (95% CI) DALE loss of 3.5 (3.3-3.7) years, that 
represented on average a loss of 35.6% (33.8-37.4) as a percentage of life 
expectancy. Higher pain severity and analgesic treatment was statistically 
linked to more years of DALE lost; from 2.8 (2.3-3.2), in no/mild, to 9.0 
(8.6-9.4) years in severe pain, and from 32.2% (27.5-36.9) to 90.9% (86.5-95.3) 
of life expectancy, respectively.
DISCUSSION: In Spain, older adults with moderate to severe OA pain receiving 
usual analgesics showed a substantial BoD in terms of years of DALE lost and 
percentage of life expectancy lost.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with treated moderate to severe pain showed a more 
significant burden in term of DALE lost despite analgesic treatment, which 
apparently fails to meet pain management needs.

INTRODUCTION: As people with HIV age, prevention and management of other 
communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will become increasingly 
important. Integration of screening and treatment for HIV and NCDs is a 
promising approach for addressing the dual burden of these diseases. The aim of 
this study was to assess the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of a 
community-wide integrated programme for screening and treatment of HIV, 
hypertension and diabetes in Kenya.
METHODS: Coupling a microsimulation of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with a 
population-based model of HIV dynamics (the Spectrum), we created a hybrid 
HIV/CVD model. Interventions were modelled from year 2019 (baseline) to 2023, 
and population was followed to 2033. Analyses were carried at a national level 
and for three selected regions (Nairobi, Coast and Central).
RESULTS: At a national level, the model projected 7.62 million individuals 
living with untreated hypertension, 692,000 with untreated diabetes and 592,000 
individuals in need of ART in year 2018. Improving ART coverage from 68% at 
baseline to 88% in 2033 reduced HIV incidence by an estimated 64%. Providing NCD 
treatment to 50% of diagnosed cases from 2019 to 2023 and maintaining them on 
treatment afterwards could avert 116,000 CVD events and 43,600 CVD deaths in 
Kenya over the next 15 years. At a regional level, the estimated impact of 
expanded HIV services was highest in Nairobi region (averting 42,100 HIV 
infections compared to baseline) while Central region experienced the highest 
impact of expanded NCD treatment (with a reduction of 22,200 CVD events). The 
integrated HIV/NCD intervention could avert 7.76 million 
disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) over 15 years at an estimated cost of 
$6.68 billion ($445.27 million per year), or $860.30 per DALY averted. At a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of $2,010 per DALY averted, the probability of 
cost-effectiveness was 0.92, ranging from 0.71 in Central to 0.92 in Nairobi 
region.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated screening and treatment of HIV and NCDs can be a 
cost-effective and impactful approach to save lives of people with HIV in Kenya, 
although important variation exists at the regional level. Containing the 
substantial costs required for scale-up will be critical for management of HIV 
and NCDs on a national scale.

INTRODUCTION: People living with HIV (PLHIV) have an elevated risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to their HIV-negative 
peers. Expanding statin use may help alleviate this burden. However, the choice 
of statin in the context of antiretroviral therapy is challenging. Pravastatin 
and pitavastatin improve cholesterol levels in PLHIV without interacting 
substantially with antiretroviral therapy. They are also more expensive than 
most statins. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin and 
pitavastatin for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are 
not currently using lipid-lowering therapy.
METHODS: We developed a discrete-state microsimulation model that randomly 
selected (with replacement) individuals from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational 
Database cohort who were aged 40 to 75 years, receiving antiretroviral therapy 
in Thailand, and not using lipid-lowering therapy. The model simulated each 
individual's probability of experiencing CVD. We evaluated: (1) treating no one 
with statins; (2) treating everyone with pravastatin 20mg/day (drug cost 7568 
Thai Baht ($US243)/year) and (3) treating everyone with pitavastatin 2 mg/day 
(drug cost 8182 Baht ($US263)/year). Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were assigned in annual cycles over a 20-year time horizon 
and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed the Thai healthcare sector 
perspective.
RESULTS: Pravastatin was estimated to be less effective and less cost-effective 
than pitavastatin and was therefore dominated (extended) by pitavastatin. 
Patients receiving pitavastatin accumulated 0.042 additional QALYs compared with 
those not using a statin, at an extra cost of 96,442 Baht ($US3095), giving an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,300,000 Baht ($US73,812)/QALY gained. 
These findings were sensitive to statin costs and statin efficacy, pill burden, 
and targeting of PLHIV based on CVD risk. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
160,000 Baht ($US5135)/QALY gained, we estimated that pravastatin would become 
cost-effective at an annual cost of 415 Baht ($US13.30)/year and pitavastatin 
would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 600 Baht ($US19.30)/year.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither pravastatin nor pitavastatin were projected to be 
cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are 
not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. We do not recommend expanding 
current use of these drugs among PLHIV in Thailand without substantial price 
reduction.

INTRODUCTION: Despite growing enthusiasm for integrating treatment of 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care 
and treatment services in sub-Saharan Africa, there is little evidence on the 
potential health and financial consequences of such integration. We aim to study 
the cost-effectiveness of basic NCD-HIV integration in a Ugandan setting.
METHODS: We developed an epidemiologic-cost model to analyze, from the provider 
perspective, the cost-effectiveness of integrating hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and high cholesterol screening and treatment for people living 
with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. We utilized 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimations drawing from the previously 
established Globorisk model and systematic reviews; HIV and NCD risk factor 
prevalence from the World Health Organization's STEPwise approach to 
Surveillance survey and global databases; and cost data from national drug price 
lists, expert consultation and the literature. Averted CVD cases and 
corresponding disability-adjusted life years were estimated over 10 subsequent 
years along with incremental cost-effectiveness of the integration.
RESULTS: Integrating services for hypertension, DM, and high cholesterol among 
ART patients in Uganda was associated with a mean decrease of the 10-year risk 
of a CVD event: from 8.2 to 6.6% in older PLWH women (absolute risk reduction of 
1.6%), and from 10.7 to 9.5% in older PLWH men (absolute risk reduction of 
1.2%), respectively. Integration would yield estimated net costs between $1,400 
and $3,250 per disability-adjusted life year averted among older ART patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing services for hypertension, DM and high cholesterol for 
Ugandan ART patients would reduce the overall CVD risk among these patients; it 
would amount to about 2.4% of national HIV/AIDS expenditure, and would present a 
cost-effectiveness comparable to other standalone interventions to address NCDs 
in low- and middle-income country settings.

BACKGROUND: Topical vaginal estrogen therapy is considered the gold standard 
treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause-associated dyspareunia, but 
early investigations of energy-based devices show promise for patients with 
contraindications or those who are refractory to vaginal estrogen cream therapy. 
Although evaluating safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes for novel 
technologies is critically important when new technologies become available to 
treat unmet healthcare needs, evaluation of the costs of these new technologies 
compared with existing therapies is also critically important but often 
understudied.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 therapies for 
genitourinary syndrome of menopause, including vaginal estrogen therapy, oral 
ospemifene therapy, and vaginal CO2 laser therapy and determine if vaginal laser 
therapy is a cost-effective treatment strategy for dyspareunia associated with 
genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
STUDY DESIGN: An institutional review board-exempt cost-effectiveness analysis 
was performed by constructing a decision tree using decision analysis software 
(TreeAge Pro; TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA) using integrated 
empirical data from the published literature. Tornado plots and 1-way and 2-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess how changes in the model's input 
parameters altered the overall outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis model.
RESULTS: All 3 treatment methods were found to be cost-effective below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000.00 per quality-adjusted life year for 
moderate dyspareunia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for vaginal CO2 
laser therapy was $16,372.01 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
ospemifene therapy was $5711.14. Although all 3 treatment strategies were on the 
efficient frontier, vaginal CO2 laser therapy was the optimal treatment strategy 
with the highest effectiveness. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of treatment 
adherence, vaginal CO2 laser therapy was no longer cost-effective when the 
adherence fell below 38.8%. Vaginal estrogen cream and ospemifene therapies 
remained cost-effective treatment strategies at all ranges of adherence. When 
varying the adherence to 100% for all strategies, oral ospemifene therapy was 
"dominated" by both vaginal CO2 laser therapy and vaginal estrogen cream 
therapy. In a 2-way sensitivity analysis of vaginal CO2 laser therapy adherence 
and vaginal CO2 laser therapy cost, vaginal CO2 laser therapy still remained the 
optimal treatment strategy at 200% of its current cost ($5554.00) when the 
adherence was >55%. When the cost fell to 20% of its current cost ($555.40), it 
was the optimal treatment strategy at all adherence values above 29%.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that vaginal fractional CO2 laser therapy is a 
cost-effective treatment strategy for dyspareunia associated with GSM, as are 
both vaginal estrogen and oral ospemifene therapies. In our model, vaginal CO2 
laser therapy is the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy, and insurance 
coverage should be considered for this treatment option if it is proven to be 
safe and effective in FDA trials.

Malignant dysphagia is the most common symptom in advanced oesogastric cancers 
patients. Relief of dysphagia allows quality of life improvement, nutritional 
replenishment and potentially improves prognosis. Chemotherapy alone is 
effective and should be prioritised in patients with metastatic disease a good 
performance status, and its impact on dysphagia should be determined before 
further interventions are planned. Regarding local treatments, the insertion of 
a covered self-expandable metallic stent is the most commonly used alternative, 
as it allows for the rapid relief of severe dysphagia. Although several 
randomised trials have highlighted the role of oesophageal brachytherapy, this 
technique is often not easily accessible. Contemporary trials are ongoing to 
better define the role of external radiation therapy. While awaiting these 
results, external radiation therapy can be considered as a second-best option 
for patients with a life-expectancy > 3 months. It is important to offer 
nutritional support and to integrate quality of life measures in the palliative 
management of dysphagia. This multidisciplinary international position paper 
aims to propose a decision-making process and highlight randomised trials for 
the management of malignant dysphagia in metastatic oesogastric cancer patients.

PURPOSE: This post hoc analysis assessed the effects of adjunctive perampanel on 
myoclonic and absence seizure outcomes in patients (aged ≥12 years) with 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures 
during the double-blind (up to 8 mg/day) and open-label extension (OLEx; up to 
12 mg/day) phases of Study 332.
METHODS: Patients experiencing myoclonic and/or absence seizures during study 
baseline were included. Assessments for myoclonic and absence seizures included: 
median percent change in seizure frequency, number of seizure days and 
seizure-free days (all per 28 days), 50 % and 75 % responder rates, 
seizure-freedom rates, seizure worsening, and monitoring of treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs).
RESULTS: During the double-blind phase, myoclonic and/or absence seizures were 
reported in 47/163 and 60/163 patients, respectively. Median percent reductions 
in seizure frequency per 28 days from study baseline were 52.5% and 24.5% 
(myoclonic seizures) and 7.6 % and 41.2 % (absence seizures) for placebo and 
perampanel, respectively; seizure-freedom rates were 13.0 % and 16.7 % 
(myoclonic seizures) and 12.1 % and 22.2 % (absence seizures), respectively. 
During the OLEx phase, 46/138 and 52/138 patients experienced myoclonic and/or 
absence seizures, respectively. Responses during the double-blind phase were 
maintained during long-term (>104 weeks) adjunctive perampanel treatment. The 
frequency/type of TEAEs was consistent with the known safety profile of 
perampanel.
CONCLUSION: In this post hoc analysis, adjunctive perampanel was not associated 
with any overall worsening of absence seizures. Further research is needed to 
investigate the effect of adjunctive perampanel in IGE patients with myoclonic 
and/or absence seizures.

BACKGROUND: Individual prediction of life expectancy in patients with spinal 
metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is key for optimal treatment 
selection, especially when identifying potential candidates for surgery. Most 
reported prognostic tools provide categorical predictions, and only a few 
include HCC-related factors. This study aimed to investigate the natural 
progression of the disease and develop a prognostic tool that is capable of 
providing individualized predictions.
METHODS: Patients with HCC-derived metastatic spinal disease were identified 
from a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal metastases who were 
diagnosed at Chiang Mai University Hospital between 2006 and 2015. Kaplain-Meier 
methods and log-rank tests were used to statistically evaluate potential 
factors. Significant predictors from the univariable analysis were included in 
the flexible parametric survival regression for the development of a prognostic 
prediction model.
RESULTS: Of the 1143 patients diagnosed with HCC, 69 (6%) had spinal metastases. 
The median survival time of patients with HCC after spinal metastases was 79 
days. In the multivariable analysis, a total of 11 potential clinical predictors 
were included. After backward elimination, four final predictors remained: 
patients aged > 60 years, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin level, 
and multifocality of HCC. The model showed an acceptable discrimination at 
C-statistics 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0.79) and fair calibration.
CONCLUSION: Four clinical parameters were used in the development of the 
individual survival prediction model for patients with HCC-derived spinal 
metastases of Chiang Mai University or HCC-SM CMU model. Prospective external 
validation studies in a larger population are required prior to the clinical 
implication of the model.

Anthropogenic modifications at catchments scale may be reconducted primarily at 
soil sealing and streams culverting, even if important consequences result from 
roads density and, more in general, infrastructures as they cause landscape 
fragmentation, and agricultural areas extension. Their most important outcomes 
in terms of hydrologic balance are the decreasing time of concentration and the 
increasing flood risk at catchment scale. The research introduces a 
methodological approach to classify the degree of anthropogenic modifications at 
catchment scale: clustering techniques have been applied to 508 catchments in a 
high-risk flooding sector of the Mediterranean region. Then, flood data recorded 
in the study area in the 1900-2018 period have been compared to clustering 
classification, pointing out the relationships with soil sealing and 
hydrographical network culverting in the catchment. The analysis has been 
performed considering fourteen subsets of 8 descriptive parameters each that 
differ in the evaluation of culverting in the terminal part of the 
hydrographical network; the analysis has been conducted identifying the optimal 
number of descriptive parameters and the corresponding best number of clusters 
on quantitative basis. The results show that three classes clustering is the 
more appropriate from a computational point of view. That division looks 
coherent with the features of the studied basins and is well correlated with 
floods occurrence in the last 100 years. Finally, the proposed methodology of 
anthropogenic disturbance classification at catchment scale may be applied to 
other areas even adapting and implementing other descriptive parameters. Then, 
it may be used to support the planning of mitigation strategies in term of flood 
risk.

Objective: To quantitatively analyze the death and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY) attributed to high level serum LDL-C in Chinese population in 2017. 
Methods: Data were obtained from the '2017 Global Burden of Disease Study 
(GBD2017)'. Population attributable fraction (PAF), number and rate of deaths 
and DALY attributable to high LDL-C were used to describe the burden of disease 
by gender, age groups, diseases and provinces in China. Both rates on mortality 
and DALY were standardized by GBD world population. Results: In 2017, 862 759 
deaths were caused by high level serum LDL-C in China, that accounting for 8.25% 
of the total deaths. Of the attributable deaths, 705 355 (81.76%) persons died 
from ischemic heart disease (IHD), while the remaining 18.24% from ischemic 
stroke (IS). High LDL-C accounted for 40.30% of the total deaths from ischemic 
heart disease and 18.49% from ischemic stroke. The highest PAF of death (13.70%) 
appeared in Jilin province and the lowest in Zhejiang province (4.65%). PAF of 
death was seen higher in females than in males, while both age-standardized 
rates of mortality and DALY appeared higher in males than in females. High LDL-C 
attributed mortality rate appeared as 61.08/100 000 after standardization in 
Chinese population. High LDL-C attributed DALYs were 18.16 million person years, 
among which 76.76% were caused by IHD (13.94 million person years), with DALY 
rate as 1285.83/100 000. Among provinces, Heilongjiang showed the highest 
standardized DALY rate, and Zhejiang the lowest. The PAF, number of deaths, 
rates on mortality and DALY caused by high LDL-C were high among residents above 
70 years old, with the DALY number as 8.56 million person years, highest seen in 
the age group from 50 to 69 years old. Conclusion: The burden of disease 
attributed to high level LDL-C was quite high and with gender, age group and 
interprovincial differences, in China in 2017.

BACKGROUND: Sugar-sweetened beverage taxes are a rapidly growing policy tool and 
can be based on absolute volume, sugar content tiers, or absolute sugar content. 
Yet, their comparative health and economic impacts have not been quantified, in 
particular, tiered or sugar content taxes that provide industry incentives for 
sugar reduction.
METHODS: We estimated incremental changes in diabetes mellitus and 
cardiovascular disease, quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of 3 sugar-sweetened beverage tax designs in the United 
States, on the basis of (1) volume ($0.01/oz), (2) tiers (<5 g of added sugar/8 
oz: no tax; 5-20 g/8 oz: $0.01/oz; and >20 g/8 oz: $0.02/oz), and (3) absolute 
sugar content ($0.01 per teaspoon added sugar), each compared with a base case 
of modest ongoing voluntary industry reformulation. A validated microsimulation 
model, CVD-PREDICT (Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model for Risk, Events, 
Detection, Interventions, Costs, and Trends), incorporated national demographic 
and dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 
policy effects and sugar-sweetened beverage-related diseases from meta-analyses, 
and industry reformulation and health-related costs from established sources.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the volume, tiered, and absolute sugar content taxes 
would generate $80.4 billion, $142 billion, and $41.7 billion in tax revenue, 
respectively. From a healthcare perspective, the volume tax would prevent 
850 000 cardiovascular disease (95% CI, 836 000-864 000) and 269 000 diabetes 
mellitus (265 000-274 000) cases, gain 2.44 million quality-adjusted life-years 
(2.40-2.48), and save $53.2 billion net costs (52.3-54.1). Health gains and 
savings were approximately doubled for the tiered and absolute sugar content 
taxes. Results were robust for societal and government perspectives, at 10 years 
follow-up, and with lower (50%) tax pass-through. Health gains were largest in 
young adults, blacks and Hispanics, and lower-income Americans.
CONCLUSIONS: All sugar-sweetened beverage tax designs would generate substantial 
health gains and savings. Tiered and absolute sugar content taxes should be 
considered and evaluated for maximal potential gains.

INTRODUCTION: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important educational 
topic for student pharmacists given extended patient life expectancy and 
expanding pharmacist roles in HIV treatment and prevention. Data are lacking in 
regard to curricular content and type of training received by faculty to provide 
didactic and experiential HIV training.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based survey of United States (US) 
pharmacy schools was conducted using a 15-item questionnaire. HIV content 
experts were surveyed at 135 four-year, accredited programs.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven responses were received from schools in the Midwestern 
(34%), Northeastern (26%), Southern (26%), and Western (14%) regions. Time 
devoted to didactic HIV education ranged from 0.5 to 60 hours. The majority of 
respondents (78%, n = 29) reported 10 or fewer hours of HIV-related content, 
with 41% (n = 15) reporting five or less hours of content. Experiential practice 
sites for HIV training were variable, with a majority (80%) including an 
outpatient infectious diseases/HIV clinic. Eighty percent of respondents also 
reported students receiving fewer than 25 encounters with people living with HIV 
(PLWH) throughout their entire experiential training. Over half (54%) of 
respondents reported that the primary HIV instructor devoted four hours per week 
or less to HIV care.
CONCLUSIONS: Diversity in the amount of time devoted to HIV didactic education 
existed among reporting US pharmacy schools. Few schools have dedicated faculty 
spending a substantial amount of time in direct care of PLWH. Minimum standards 
for HIV education in schools of pharmacy should be established.

PURPOSE: To perform 11- and 2-year health care sector (ophthalmic) and societal 
cost perspective reference case, cost-utility analyses comparing bevacizumab, 
ranibizumab, and aflibercept monotherapies for neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (NVAMD).
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: The authors performed 11-year and 2-year ophthalmic and societal cost 
perspective, cost-utility analyses comparing bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and 
aflibercept monotherapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
(NVAMD). We employed patient utilities, bilateral outcomes, 2018 U.S. dollars, 
vision-related mortality, a Medicare fee schedule, and CATT (Comparison of 
Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments) study and VIEW (VEGF Trap-Eye: 
Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD) trial. Cochrane data were also 
used.
SETTING: Center for Value-Based Medicine. Patient/study population: patients 
with NVAMD.
INTERVENTION: Cost-utility analyses using published data. Data-modeled 10-year 
vision outcomes were modeled forward to year 11.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: These included cost-utility ratios (CURs), costs, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. $100,00/QALY was considered the US 
cost-effectiveness upper limit.
RESULTS: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab each conferred an 11-year, 1.339 QALY gain 
versus observation. Aflibercept conferred a 1.380 QALY gain. Aflibercept 
conferred greater QALY gain for less cost than ranibizumab but was not 
cost-effective compared to bevacizumab ($1,151,451/QALY incremental CUR). The 
average ophthalmic cost perspective CUR for bevacizumab was $11,033/QALY, 
$79,600/QALY for ranibizumab, and $44,801/QALY for aflibercept. Eleven-year 
therapies saved a 1.0 year-of-life loss without treatment from the 11.0-year 
life expectancy. Early treatment was 138%-149% more cost-effective than late 
treatment. Two-year therapy prevented a 1-month-of-life loss, and revealed 
bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept conferred 0.141, 0.141, and 0.164 QALY 
gains, respectively, with corresponding average CURs of $40,371/QALY, 
$335,726/QALY, and $168,006/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: From an ophthalmic (medical) cost perspective, bevacizumab, 
ranibizumab, and aflibercept NVAMD monotherapies were all cost-effective over 11 
years, with bevacizumab 6.21× more cost-effective than ranibizumab and 3.06× 
more cost-effective than aflibercept. Two-year modeling revealed bevacizumab was 
cost-effective, whereas ranibizumab and aflibercept were not. Early treatment 
was critical for obtaining optimal vision and cost-effectiveness, as is 
long-term follow-up and adherence to treatment.

CFTR modulators have dramatically changed the clinical course of CF in those 
fortunate enough to receive them. Inevitably, randomised controlled trials 
during the development of these drugs are too short to use mortality as an 
outcome. Evidence for their effect on life expectancy are best gained from real 
world registry studies specifically looking at mortality, but these are only 
available for ivacaftor to date. Therefore, indirect evidence must be obtained 
by looking at outcomes known to affect mortality and seeing the effect of these 
drugs on those outcomes.

Air Microbiome and Pollution: Composition and Potential Effects on Human Health, 
Including SARS Coronavirus Infection.

Polluted air poses a significant threat to human health. Exposure to particulate 
matter (PM) and harmful gases contributes to cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases, including allergies and obstructive lung disease. Air pollution may 
also be linked to cancer and reduced life expectancy. Uptake of PM has been 
shown to cause pathological changes in the intestinal microbiota in mice and 
humans. Less is known about the effects of pollution-associated microbiota on 
human health. Several recent studies described the microbiomes of urban and 
rural air samples, of the stratosphere and sand particles, which can be 
transported over long distances, as well as the air of indoor environments. 
Here, we summarize the current knowledge on airborne bacterial, viral, and 
fungal communities and discuss their potential consequences on human health. The 
current data suggest that bacterial pathogens are typically too sparse and 
short-lived in air to pose a significant risk for infecting healthy people. 
However, airborne fungal spores may exacerbate allergies and asthma. Little 
information is available on viruses including phages, and future studies are 
likely to detect known and novel viruses with a yet unknown impact on human 
health. Furthermore, varying experimental protocols have been employed in the 
recent microbiome and virome studies. Therefore, standardized methodologies will 
be required to allow for better comparisons between studies. Air pollution has 
been linked to more severe outcomes of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections. This may have contributed to severe 
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, especially those in China, Northern Italy, Iran, and New 
York City.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer represents an important preventable cause of 
morbidity and mortality in developing countries such as Brazil. Investigating 
temporal evolution of a disease burden in the different realities of the country 
is essential for improving public policies.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the national and subnational burden of cervical cancer, 
based on the estimates of the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study.
METHODS: Descriptive study of premature mortality (years of life lost [YLL]) and 
burden of disease (disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) associated with 
cervical cancer among Brazilian women aged 25-64 years, between 2000 and 2017.
FINDINGS: During the study period, age-standardized incidence decreased from 
23.53 (22.79-24.26) to 18.39 (17.63-19.17) per 100,000 women, while mortality 
rates decreased from 11.3 (11.05-11.56) to 7.74 (7.49-8.02) per 100,000 women. 
These rates were about two to three times greater than equivalent rates in a
