affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between improved depression 
and enhanced benefit-finding.
DESIGN: MS patients (N=127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical 
trial comparing two types of telephone psychotherapy for depression, were 
assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- 
and 12-month posttherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression was measured with a telephone administered 
version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Positive Affect was 
measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect 
Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; 
Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related 
Growth Scale.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, controlling 
for time since MS diagnosis and type of treatment. Improved depression was 
associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relationship between 
improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both 
increased optimism and increased positive affect.
CONCLUSION: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity 
appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.

BACKGROUND: Russia is one of the very few industrialised countries in the world 
where life expectancy has been declining. Alcohol has been implicated as a major 
contributor to the rapid fluctuations observed in male life expectancy since 
1985 that have been particularly marked among working-age men. One approach to 
reducing the alcohol problem in Russia is 'brief interventions' which seek to 
change views of the personal acceptability of excessive drinking and to 
encourage self-directed behaviour change. There is limited understanding in 
Russia of the salience and applicability of Motivational Interviewing (MI), a 
well-defined brief intervention commonly used to target alcohol-related 
behaviour, but MI may have important potential for success within the Russian 
context.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be an individually randomised two-armed parallel 
group exploratory trial. The primary hypothesis is that a brief adaptation of MI 
will be effective in reducing self-reported hazardous drinking at 3 months. The 
secondary hypothesis is that it will be effective in reducing self-reported past 
week beverage alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence and related problems at 3 
months and at 12 months. MI will also be effective at 12 months in reducing 
self-reported hazardous drinking, alcohol dependence and related problems, proxy 
reported hazardous drinking, and recent alcohol use as indicated by bio-markers. 
Participants are drawn from the Izhevsk Family Study II, with eligibility 
determined based on proxy reports of hazardous drinking in the past year. All 
participants undergo a health check, with MI subsequently delivered to those in 
the intervention arm. Signed consent is obtained from those in the intervention 
arm at this point. Both groups are then invited for 3 and 12 month follow ups. 
The control group will not receive any additional intervention.

Reproductive conflict and the separation of reproductive generations in humans.

An enduring puzzle of human life history is why women cease reproduction midway 
through life. Selection can favor postreproductive survival because older 
females can help their offspring to reproduce. But the kin-selected fitness 
gains of helping appear insufficient to outweigh the potential benefits of 
continued reproduction. Why then do women cease reproduction in the first place? 
Here, we suggest that early reproductive cessation in humans is the outcome of 
reproductive competition between generations, and we present a simple candidate 
model of how this competition will be resolved. We show that among primates 
exhibiting a postreproductive life span, humans exhibit an extraordinarily low 
degree of reproductive overlap between generations. The rapid senescence of the 
human female reproductive system coincides with the age at which, in natural 
fertility populations, women are expected to encounter reproductive competition 
from breeding females of the next generation. Several lines of evidence suggest 
that in ancestral hominids, this younger generation typically comprised 
immigrant females. In these circumstances, relatedness asymmetries within 
families are predicted to give younger females a decisive advantage in 
reproductive conflict with older females. A model incorporating both the costs 
of reproductive competition and the benefits of grandmothering can account for 
the timing of reproductive cessation in humans and so offers an improved 
understanding of the evolution of menopause.

Unresolved lytic lesions following parathyroidectomy in a patient with chronic 
renal failure.

Road, Hong Kong, China. margaretfok@netscape.net

With advances in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure, their 
life expectancy has increased. In turn, the prevalence of osteitis fibrosa 
cystica, a manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and beta2 
microglobulin amyloidosis, a result of long-term haemodialysis, has risen. While 
both conditions share similar radiological features, their management is very 
different. We present the case of a patient with renal failure who had been 
receiving haemodialysis for over 20 years. Lytic lesions had been observed in 
the proximal part of both femurs for ten years. A presumptive diagnosis of 
osteitis fibrosa cystica was made. However, no regression of the lesions 
occurred after parathyroidectomy. The patient subsequently developed sequential 
pathological fractures through the lesions, for which bilateral total hip 
replacements were performed. Histology of the lesions revealed that the patient 
was in fact suffering from amyloidosis. In patients with chronic renal failure, 
osseous amyloidosis is a highly probable differential diagnosis, especially if 
no regression of a lytic lesion is observed after parathyroidectomy.

Assessing the influence of gestalt-type characteristics on preferences over 
lifetime health profiles.

London, UK. a.j.oliver@lse.ac.uk

INTRODUCTION: In contrast to the basic tenets of economic theory, there is 
substantial evidence that people's remembered and predicted utility of events 
systematically differs from the utility that they experience. These systematic 
differences are caused by "gestalt characteristics.'' The objective of this 
study was to test whether people maximize quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
or whether QALY maximization is compromised by their being influenced by factors 
that resemble the gestalt characteristics when choosing between lifetime health 
profiles.
METHODS: Time trade-off values were elicited from 50 respondents, who were also 
presented with a series of hypothetical questions that each depicted 2 lifetime 
health profiles. The respondents were asked to choose which of the 2 profiles in 
each question they would prefer to experience. By inputting the values that the 
respondents placed on the health states into the lifetime health profiles, it 
was possible to observe whether their answers were consistent with QALY 
maximization or with various hypothesized gestalt-type effects.
RESULTS: Across decisions that involve a simple trade-off between the length of 
life and the quality of the health state, choices consistent with QALY 
maximizing were relatively common, although even here approximately half of the 
respondents violated this rule. Consistency with QALY maximization was lower in 
most of the other tests and indicated that many people might, for example, 
prefer to trade off some lifetime health to experience a good end to life, or to 
avoid highly unstable lifetime health profiles.
CONCLUSION: The respondents' answers were often consistent with the hypothesized 
gestalt-type effects, but it is probable that for some of the questions the 
characteristics themselves were not driving the respondents' answers and that 
factors such as complex rates of discounting might have played a role. However, 
whatever the driving motivation behind the respondents' answers, the important 
point to note from this study is that QALY maximization is often substantially 
and systematically violated when people are offered a choice over the lifetime 
health profiles that they would prefer to experience.

The role of value for money in public insurance coverage decisions for drugs in 
Australia: a retrospective analysis 1994-2004.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relative influence of factors in decisions for public 
insurance coverage of new drugs in Australia.
DATA SOURCES: Evidence presented at meetings of the Australian Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) that makes recommendations on coverage of 
drugs under Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
STUDY SELECTION: All major submissions to the PBAC between February 1994 and 
December 2004 (n = 858) if one of the outcomes measured was life year gained 
(n=138) or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained (n=116).
RESULTS: Clinical significance, cost-effectiveness, cost to government, and 
severity of disease were significant influences on decisions. Compared to the 
average submission, clinical significance increased the probability of 
recommending coverage by 0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.40), 
whereas a drug in a life-threatening condition had an increased probability of 
being recommended for coverage of 0.38 (0.06 to 0.69). An increase in $A10,000 
from a mean incremental cost per QALY of $A46,400 reduced the probability of 
listing by 0.06 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.1).
CONCLUSIONS: The PBAC provides an example of the long-term stability and 
coherence of evidence-based coverage and pricing decisions for drugs that weighs 
up the evidence on clinical effectiveness, clinical need, and value for money. 
There is no evidence of a fixed public threshold value of life years or QALYs, 
but willingness to pay is clearly related to the characteristics of the clinical 
condition, perceived confidence in the evidence of effectiveness and its 
relevance, as well as total cost to government.

Deaconess Medical Center, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

CONTEXT: Sepsis is associated with high mortality and treatment costs. 
International guidelines recommend the implementation of integrated sepsis 
protocols; however, the true cost and cost-effectiveness of these are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an integrated sepsis protocol, as 
compared with conventional care.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients presenting with septic 
shock and enrolled in the institution's integrated sepsis protocol. Clinical and 
economic outcomes were compared with a historical control cohort.
SETTING: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
PATIENTS: Overall, 79 patients presenting to the emergency department with 
septic shock in the treatment cohort and 51 patients in the control group.
INTERVENTIONS: An integrated sepsis treatment protocol incorporating empirical 
antibiotics, early goal-directed therapy, intensive insulin therapy, 
lung-protective ventilation, and consideration for drotrecogin alfa and steroid 
therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital treatment costs were collected using the 
hospital's detailed accounting system. The cost-effectiveness analysis was 
performed from the perspective of the healthcare system using a lifetime 
horizon. The primary end point for the cost-effectiveness analysis was the 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained.
RESULTS: Mortality in the treatment group was 20.3% vs. 29.4% in the control 
group (p = .23). Implementing an integrated sepsis protocol resulted in a mean 
increase in cost of approximately $8,800 per patient, largely driven by 
increased intensive care unit length of stay. Life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life years were higher in the treatment group; 0.78 and 0.54, 
respectively. The protocol was associated with an incremental cost of $11,274 
per life-year saved and a cost of $16,309 per quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with septic shock, an integrated sepsis protocol, 
although not cost-saving, appears to be cost-effective and compares very 
favorably to other commonly delivered acute care interventions.

Pavia, Pavia, Italy. simone.gerzeli@unipv.it

The study determines the cost-utility of a unilateral electronic knee prosthesis 
(C-leg) compared to mechanical alternatives in trans-femoral amputees. For each 
type of prosthesis, 50 patients, treated in a major Italian centre, were 
enrolled. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from responses to 
EuroQol (EQ-5D). Healthcare and social costs were assessed for the estimated 
life cycle of the technologies (5 years). C-leg was associated with 0.09 more 
QALYs per patient per year (P = 0.007). For the 5-year period, the incremental 
cost-utility ratio of C-leg resulted in euro 35,971 per QALY from the healthcare 
system perspective. If non-healthcare costs and productivity losses are 
included, the two groups to have similar costs (euro 66,669 vs euro 66,927).

Life table demography of Ceriodaphnia dubia (Cladocera) exposed to copper at 
different levels and periods.

We studied the demographic responses of Ceriodaphnia dubia exposed to copper at 
3 different levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg l(-1)) and at 4 exposure periods (3, 6, 
12 and 24 hr) in addition to controls (without the heavy metal). The tested 
levels of Cu concentration and the chosen periods of exposure affected some 
demographic variables (average lifespan, gross and net reproductive rates and 
generation time). Depending on the heavy metal concentration and the period of 
exposure, the average lifespan of C. dubia varied from 18 to 24 day Net 
reproductive rates (NRR) ranged from 50 to 80 offspring per female per lifespan, 
while the rate of population increase (r) varied from 0.30 to 0.34 per day 
Though gross reproductive rates (especially at low and intermediate copper 
levels and shorter duration of exposure) showed significantly higher values than 
controls, both NRR and r were either unaffected or decreased. It is therefore 
necessary to regulate the release of untreated industrial effluents containing 
copper into freshwater ecosystems. Our study thus highlights the importance of 
including, not only toxicant concentrations but also exposure time, in 
ecotoxicological evaluations.

Across the 42 counties of Romania, the total suicide rate and the population 
percentage of ethnic Hungarians were strongly positively interrelated (79% 
attributable variance). Counties with the strongest Hungarian minority had 
suicide rates converging to (or exceeding) the suicide rate for Hungary, which 
rate is high. Of a set of about 20 vital statistics and socioeconomic 
indicators, only life expectancy predicted a significant increment of further 
variance in the suicide rates. However, this effect was small, adding merely 3% 
further variance explained to 79% already accounted for. Overall, the findings 
are supportive of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e., the notion that 
geographic patterns of suicide prevalence may be partially due to genetic 
differences between populations. Supplemental analyses of a questionnaire item 
which specifically queried this study's main finding indicated widespread 
disbelief of this fact of suicide prevalence across a variety of samples, 
including two samples from Romania.

HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B: cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2a 
compared to lamivudine in Taiwan.

Veenstra DL(1), Sullivan SD, Lai MY, Lee CM, Tsai CM, Patel KK.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: In Taiwan, the carrier rate of hepatitis B surface antigen is 15% to 
20%, one of the highest in the world. Among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of 
these patients. A recent study found that peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) is more 
effective than lamivudine in treating HBeAg-negative CHB, but its 
cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. Our objective is to evaluate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a compared to 
48 weeks of lamivudine, from the perspective of the Taiwan Bureau of National 
Health Insurance.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the natural history of 
HBeAg-negative CHB in a cohort of 40-year-old patients. Efficacy, disease 
progression, economic, and quality-of-life data were derived from published 
literature and a survey of clinical experts in Taiwan. Life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs in New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (1 
USD = 31.96 NTD), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: The gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 48 weeks of 
peginterferon alfa-2a compared to 48 weeks of lamivudine was 0.45 at an 
additional cost of 157,000 NTD (4900 USD), resulting in an ICER of 347,000 NTD 
(10,900 USD) per QALY gained. The 95% central range for the ICER from a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 228,000-566,000 NTD (7100-17,700 USD).
CONCLUSIONS: In HBeAg-negative CHB, 48 weeks of treatment with peginterferon 
alfa-2a compared to 48 weeks of lamivudine appears to offer life expectancy and 
quality-of-life improvements at an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the most cost-effective screening policy for 
population-based mammography breast cancer screening in Slovenia using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model for breast cancer was constructed. 
General principles of cost-effectiveness analysis with multiple strategies were 
used to compare the costs and effects of 36 different screening policies. Using 
probability distributions for model parameters, the true effect of uncertainty 
across model input parameters on expected costs and effects was explored. The 
results from probabilistic simulation analysis are presented in a form of 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with cost-effectiveness acceptability 
frontier.
RESULTS: With the presented analysis, it was shown that a 1-year screening 
interval in population breast cancer screening would produce less benefits at 
higher costs than less intensive screening and that a 2-year interval would be 
cost-effective only at high values of society's willingness to pay per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Therefore, the optimal screening policy 
should be chosen among 3-year-interval policies.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly quoted thresholds of society's willingness to pay 
per QALY of $50,000, the optimal approach in the Slovenian population would be 
screening women aged from 40 to 80 years every 3 years.

Cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin in the prevention of ischemic heart disease 
in Portugal.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin in the treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 
Portugal.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was constructed to analyze the costs and 
consequences of lifetime treatment with rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, 
and simvastatin. For this purpose, the results from randomized head-to-head 
trials evaluating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) changes were combined with the 
results from a meta-analysis defining the relationship between LDL levels and 
fatal and nonfatal IHD events. The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) was 
derived from a 9-year Portuguese observational study. The eligible population 
was defined as untreated individuals aged more than 35 years with LDL levels 
above 115 mg/dl. Death rates due to IHD and other causes were obtained from 
official data. Resource use in the treatment of MI was estimated by a Delphi 
panel of eight Portuguese cardiologists with at least 15 years of clinical 
practice. Costs were calculated from the payers' perspective.
RESULTS: Rosuvastatin increases life expectancy between 5.5 and 12.1 days per 
patient. It is cost-saving when compared to atorvastatin, but it increases costs 
when assessed against pravastatin and simvastatin (euro1,004 and euro684 per 
patient, respectively). Therefore, rosuvastatin is a dominant alternative 
compared to atorvastatin, having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
euro30,350 to pravastatin and euro39,340 to simvastatin. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, performed rosuvastatin always dominates atorvastatin and 
is associated with a cost per life-year gained inferior to euro50,000 in 95.7% 
of the cases when compared to pravastatin and in 67.0% simulations when assessed 
against simvastatin.
CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin is a cost-effective alternative in the prevention of 
IHD in Portugal.

Cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses of neuraminidase inhibitors 
for the treatment of influenza.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the 
treatment of suspected influenza in otherwise healthy adults and to identify 
future research priorities using value of information analysis.
METHODS: A decision model was used to estimate the costs and effects, in terms 
of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of amantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir 
for the treatment of influenza in otherwise healthy adults using data 
predominantly from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was conducted. The expected 
value of perfect information for the entire model and for individual parameters 
was calculated.
RESULTS: Based on mean costs and effects, zanamivir is dominated by oseltamivir. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for amantadine (compared with no 
treatment) is pound 11,000 and pound 44,000 for oseltamivir (compared with 
amantadine). The probability that amantadine is cost-effective at a willingness 
to pay of pound 30,000 per QALY is 0.74, falling to 0.49 at pound 20,000 per 
QALY. Global expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is pound 2 m over 15 
years if a willingness to pay threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY is assumed 
rising to pound 9.6 m at pound 45,000 per QALY. EVPI for only one parameter 
exceeds pound 500,0000 at pound 30,000 per QALY: the quality of life for 
untreated influenza.
CONCLUSIONS: At traditionally accepted values of willingness to pay for health 
benefits, it is unlikely that additional research would be an efficient use of 
scarce resources. The only exception to this would be to examine the 
health-related quality of life impact of influenza in an untreated patient 
group. If a higher threshold value were acceptable, there are a small group of 
parameters that may warrant further investigation. These would, however, require 
comparative, potentially expensive, research studies.

OBJECTIVES: Neutropenia and its complications, including febrile neutropenia 
(FN), are a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy. Results of clinical 
trials showed that prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors 
(G-CSF) is effective in preventing FN. In this study, the cost effectiveness 
(measured as cost per quality-adjusted time [days]) of three treatment 
alternatives were evaluated: no G-CSF, filgrastim administered daily for 7-12 
days after chemotherapy, and a pegylated form of G-CSF pegfilgrastim, 
administered once per cycle.
METHODS: A cost-utility model based on standard clinical practice of treating FN 
with immediate hospitalization or with ambulatory treatment, from a societal 
perspective was developed. Direct medical cost estimates for hospitalization 
were derived from claims data reported by 115 US academic medical centers. 
Indirect medical costs, productivity costs, probabilities, and utilities are 
based on published literature. Results were subjected to sensitivity analyses 
and 95% confidence intervals are based on a Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Mean estimated costs/day of hospitalization were $1984 (SD $1040, N = 
24,687) for surviving patients and $3139 (SD $2014, N = 1437) for dying 
patients. Under baseline conditions, pegfilgrastim dominated both filgrastim and 
no G-CSF, with expected costs and effectiveness of $4203 and 12.361 quality 
adjusted life-days (QALDs) for no G-CSF, $3058 and 12.967 QALDs for 
pegfilgrastim, and $5264 and 12.698 QALDs for filgrastim.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis provides strong evidence that 
pegfilgrastim is not only cost-effective but also cost-saving in most common 
clinical and economic settings. There appear to be both clinical and economic 
benefits from prophylactic administration of pegfilgrastim.

An effective treatment already exists for many diseases. In these cases the 
effectiveness of a new treatment may be established by showing that the new 
treatment is as effective as (i.e., equivalent to) or at least as effective as 
(i.e., noninferior to) the old treatment. For an economic evaluation 
accompanying a clinical equivalence or noninferiority trial it is important to 
decide before the start of the study on the appropriate research question. In 
many cases the objective of the economic evaluation will be to show equivalence 
or noninferiority of the cost-effectiveness of the treatments. This has major 
implications for the design and analysis of the economic evaluation. In this 
article we propose methods for the analysis of economic equivalence and 
noninferiority studies that are similar to the methods applied to clinical 
equivalence and noninferiority trials. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness planes 
prove to be a valuable tool in the interpretation of the results in an economic 
equivalence or noninferiority trial. The concepts described in the article are 
illustrated using the results from an economic noninferiority trial.

Advanced cutaneous malignant melanoma: a systematic review of economic and 
quality-of-life studies.

OBJECTIVE: Metastatic melanoma (MM), a major concern for health-care providers, 
is increasing. We systematically reviewed published articles describing the 
impact of interventions (drugs and screening) on quality of life (QoL) in 
patients with MM, and articles that measured QoL in MM.
METHODS: We searched secondary databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 
Cochrane, and DARE from inception to 2006 using MESH terms "melanoma" and 
"metastases." Economic articles were subject to established quality assessment 
procedures.
RESULTS: We found 13 QoL and five economic studies (three cost-effectiveness, 
two cost-utility; average quality = 83% +/- 7%). No strong evidence was found in 
this review for cost-effectiveness of interferons in Canada (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $55,090/quality-adjusted life-year) or 
temozolomide in the United States (ICER = $36,990/Life-year gained based on 
nonsignificant efficacy differences). Melanoma screening was not cost-effective 
in the United States ($150,000-931,000/life-saved) or Germany (no survival 
benefit). From the 13 QoL studies,eight measured baseline QoL; six studied the 
same population, generating similar results using different approaches/outcomes. 
Tools used included GLQ-8, QLQ-C30, QLQ-36, QWB-SA, and SF-36. Baseline scores 
QoL scores ranged from 0.60 to 0.69. Another five studies (N = 959 patients) 
were randomized trials analyzing QoL in patients treated with dacarbazine alone, 
dacarbazine +/- interferon, dacarbazine + fotemustine, interleukin +/- 
histamine, and temozolomide. Little difference was found in QoL scores between 
drugs or between baseline and end point.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness has not been widely demonstrated for treatment 
of MM. Only two studies with unimpressive results exist for treatments. 
Screening was not cost-effective in the United States or Germany. Generally, no 
significant improvements in QoL were found for any alternative for treating MM. 
A need exists for effective treatments that improve duration and QoL.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of repeated screening for 
chlamydia trachomatis at various time intervals compared to one-off screening of 
Dutch young adults.
METHODS: We used a dynamic model to fully take the spread of the disease over 
time in the population into account, with data being used gathered within the 
context of a recently performed pilot study in The Netherlands. The screening 
frequencies analyzed were: every year, every 2 years, every 5 years, and every 
10 years. The strategies were compared in terms of incremental 
cost-effectiveness, expressed as the net costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY).
RESULTS: For all interval strategies, with the exception of screening every 
year, incremental cost-effectiveness stays below the informal Dutch threshold of 
euro20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: From a health-economic point of view, for the Dutch situation, we 
estimated screening every 2 years as the optimal strategy among the options 
investigated.

Netherlands. m.f.janssen@amc.uva.nl

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is a head-to-head comparison of the 
performance of the three-level EQ-5D (3L) and a newly developed five-level 
version (5L).
METHODS: Eighty-two respondents valued 15 standardized disease descriptions and 
their own health on three response scales (3L, 5L, and visual analog scale 
[VAS]) for all five EQ-5D dimensions. Performance was studied in terms of 
feasibility, face validity, redistribution properties, ordinality, convergent 
validity, discriminatory power, and test-retest and interobserver reliability.
RESULTS: The majority of participants judged 5L as the preferred system in terms 
of feasibility (76%) and face validity (75%). In total, 1.1% of responses were 
inconsistent. Ordinality of 5L was confirmed in all cases. Convergent validity 
of 3L-VAS (range: 0.88-0.99) and 5L-VAS (0.90-0.99) were high and about equal. 
Discriminatory power (informativity) improves considerably with 5L without loss 
of Evenness. Interobserver reliability (0.49 vs. 0.57) and test-retest 
reliability (0.52 vs. 0.69) were higher in 5L.
CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D five-level version appears a valid and reliable extension 
of the three-level system. The new 5L system is particularly useful for 
describing mild health problems and monitoring population health.

The survivorship characteristics of two populations of Aedes caspius (Pallas) 
(Diptera: Culicidae) were compared in the laboratory. One population was sourced 
from Mourgues, where larvicides have been used continuously for approximately 40 
years, and the other from Pont de Gau, where there has been no consistent 
mosquito control. The aims of the study were to ascertain the basic life history 
profiles of adults and to determine whether continuous larviciding affects 
inherent adult survivorship. Life tables were constructed to calculate the 
following life expectancy parameters: mean lifetime (tau(ad)); maximum lifetime 
(tau(max)), and daily survival rate (p(ad)). All three parameters were higher 
for females than for males (paired t-test, P < or = 0.001); male mean lifetime, 
maximum lifetime and daily survival rate were 4.95 +/- 0.94 days, 20.50 +/- 6.66 
days and 0.79 +/- 0.05, respectively; female values were 14.74 +/- 3.68 days, 
49.69 +/- 16.55 days and 0.93 +/- 0.02, respectively. No differences were found 
between the two populations, and no correlations were found between initial 
adult densities and their respective survival rates. The survivorship curves for 
Ae. caspius were type IV for males (mortality rates higher for young adults) and 
type III for females (mortality rates constant).

We report on a series of 12 patients with complex congenital heart disease who 
had reached adult life after surgical palliation in early childhood and who were 
systematically followed by clinical visits. Patients were born between 1953 and 
1979 and were followed up into 2007. All patients had complex lesions with 
single ventricle physiology and were palliated either by banding of the 
pulmonary artery or by creation of systemic-pulmonary shunts. Single operations 
were performed in 4 cases, and 8 patients had 1 or more further palliative 
interventions. Late corrective surgery and heart transplantation were performed 
in 1 patient each. Eight survivors reached a mean age of 36 years at follow-up 
(range 28-48), whereas 4 patients died at a mean age of 32 years (range 22-53). 
All patients were in New York Heart Association classes II and III. 
Complications during follow-up were bacterial endocarditis (3), cerebrovascular 
accidents (3), arrhythmias (3), need for pacemakers (2). Deaths occurred 
perioperatively at transplant (1), or were caused by sudden death (2), and 
hypoxia related to fall in blood pressure (1). Successful pregnancies occurred 
in 3 patients with healthy (small) babies delivered by cesarean section in 2 of 
them, and vaginal delivery in 1. The course of life in these patients shows not 
only a wide spectrum with good quality of life in some of them but also a large 
number of potentially severe complications. Survival beyond 50 years is rare.

A systematic overview of the first pasteurised VWF/FVIII medicinal product, 
Haemate P/ Humate -P: history and clinical performance.

Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and haemophilia A (HA) lack, to 
varying degrees, the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII 
(FVIII) that are critical for normal haemostasis. These conditions in turn make 
patients prone to uncontrolled bleeding. Historically, patients with severe 
forms of VWD or HA were crippled before adulthood and their life expectancy was 
significantly reduced. Over the past decades, specific coagulation factor 
replacement therapies including Haemate P, have been developed to help patients 
achieve and maintain normal haemostasis. Haemate P is a human, plasma-derived 
VWF/FVIII medicinal product, which was first licensed in Germany in 1981 for the 
treatment of HA-associated bleeding. It has since then come to be accepted as 
the gold standard for both the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in VWD, 
especially in cases where desmopressin [1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin 
(DDAVP)] has been ineffective. Haemate P was the first effectively 
virus-inactivated (pasteurisation: 60 degrees C for 10 h in aqueous solution) 
FVIII product, whereby the risk of potentially threatening infective 
complications of plasma-derived products was reduced. Haemate P was also shown 
to have a VWF multimer profile remarkably close to that of normal plasma. This 
bibliographic review presents previously unpublished clinical data of Haemate P, 
based upon internal clinical study reports of the proprietor, CSL Behring, in 
addition to data already presented in other publications. The data demonstrate a 
predictable and well-characterised pharmacokinetic profile, and a proven record 
of short- and long-term safety, while effectively correcting the haemostatic 
defects in VWD and HA. Recently available data have also shown Haemate P to be 
of haemostatic value in exceptional clinical circumstances including surgical 
interventions. By virtue of its plasma-derived combination of VWF and FVIII, in 
addition to its high VWF:FVIII content ratio (2.4:1), Haemate P is also 
associated with successful immune tolerance induction in those patients 
developing inhibitor antibodies. Although the theoretical risk of thromboembolic 
complications does exist while receiving Haemate P, as it does with any FVIII 
replacement therapy, the incidence of such complications has remained notably 
low. Given the robust data that have accumulated for the use of Haemate P, 
dosing recommendations are also described in this review; the recommendations 
are tailored to patient-specific contexts including baseline VWF and FVIII 
levels in plasma and the type of surgical intervention being undertaken. A wide 
variety of studies have also provided data on paediatric and geriatric 
populations, all of which have suggested that Haemate P can be safely and 
effectively used in a wide variety of clinical circumstances.

Elderly women with Parkinson's disease (PD) represent a specific patient 
population that may benefit from individualized treatment strategies. PD has 
been shown to occur approximately twice as often in men than in women, resulting 
in theories regarding estrogen being protective against the disease and as a 
potential treatment strategy. Given women's longer life expectancy, they are 
more likely to reach an age where antiparkinsonian medications are associated 
with side-effects. This paper will review medical and surgical treatments as 
well as the relationship of gender and age with respect to the management of PD.

Life expectancy and quality of life among patients infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has dramatically improved with the advent of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy. Nonetheless, with the transformation of HIV 
infection into a chronic disease, a series of long-term consequences have been 
observed, among them osteoporosis. The prevalence of this condition is 
increasing among individuals with HIV infection. Although an epidemic of 
fragility fractures has not been described in these patients, an increase in the 
incidence of such fractures is anticipated as the HIV population ages, and this 
will undoubtedly have an impact on their quality of life. The numerous factors 
that favor the development of osteoporosis in these patients are related to the 
infection, itself, and the treatment received.

Stem straightness is an important selection trait in Pinus pinaster Ait. 
breeding programs. Despite the stability of stem straightness rankings in 
provenance trials, the efficiency of breeding programs based on a quantitative 
index of stem straightness remains low. An alternative approach is to analyze 
biomechanical processes that underlie stem form. The rationale for this 
selection method is that genetic differences in the biomechanical processes that 
maintain stem straightness in young plants will continue to control stem form 
throughout the life of the tree. We analyzed the components contributing most to 
genetic differences among provenances in stem straightening processes by kinetic 
analysis and with a biomechanical model defining the interactions between the 
variables involved (Fournier's model). This framework was tested on three P. 
pinaster provenances differing in adult stem straightness and growth. 
One-year-old plants were tilted at 45 degrees, and individual stem positions and 
sizes were recorded weekly for 5 months. We measured the radial extension of 
reaction wood and the anatomical features of wood cells in serial stem cross 
sections. The integral effect of reaction wood on stem leaning was computed with 
Fournier's model. Responses driven by both primary and secondary growth were 
involved in the stem straightening process, but secondary-growth-driven 
responses accounted for most differences among provenances. Plants from the 
straight-stemmed provenance showed a greater capacity for stem straightening 
than plants from the sinuous provenances mainly because of (1) more efficient 
reaction wood (higher maturation strains) and (2) more pronounced 
secondary-growth-driven autotropic decurving. These two process-based traits are 
thus good candidates for early selection of stem straightness, but additional 
tests on a greater number of genotypes over a longer period are required.

Valuing reduced antibiotic use for pediatric acute otitis media.

OBJECTIVE: The 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics acute otitis media guidelines 
urge parents to weigh the benefits of reduced antibiotic use, adverse drug 
events, and future resistance versus risks of extra costs and sick days 
resulting from guideline use. The value of decreased antibiotic resistance has 
not been quantified. The objective was to perform cost-utility analysis, 
estimating the resistance value of implementing the guidelines for acute otitis 
media treatment for children <2 years of age. Outcomes were described with a 
common denominator and the value of avoiding resistance was estimated using a 
parental perspective.
METHODS: Decision analysis results were used for outcome probabilities. 
Published utilities were used to describe outcomes in quality-adjusted life-day 
units. The minimum resistance benefit value, where the benefits of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics guidelines would at least balance their costs, was defined 
as the guidelines' incremental costs minus their other benefits.
RESULTS: For a child 2 to <6 months of age presenting to a primary care 
physician with possible otitis media, parents would need to value the resistance 
benefit at 0.77 quality-adjusted life-days per antibiotic prescription avoided 
for the guidelines' benefits to balance their costs. For the 6- to <24-month-old 
group, results were 0.67 quality-adjusted life-days per prescription avoided. 
Results were sensitive to the dollar cost utility; when willingness to pay 
ranged from $20,000 to $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, results ranged 
from 0.36 and 0.30 quality-adjusted life-days up to 4.10 and 3.57 
quality-adjusted life-days for the 2- to <6-month-old and 6- to <24-month-old 
groups, respectively. Costs were driven by missed parent work days.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, trading 0.30 to 4 quality-adjusted 
life-days to avoid 1 antibiotic course might be desirable; from a parental
