BACKGROUND: The improvement of life expectancy is one of the aims of the Healthy 
China 2030 blueprint. We aimed to investigate the extent to which healthy 
lifestyles are associated with life expectancy in Chinese adults.
METHODS: We used the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) study to examine 
the relative risk of mortality associated with individual and combined lifestyle 
factors (never smoking or quitting not for illness, no excessive alcohol use, 
being physically active, healthy eating habits, and healthy body shape). 
Participants with coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, or missing values for 
body-mass index were excluded. For analysis of chronic respiratory diseases, 
participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma were excluded. 
We estimated the national prevalence of lifestyle factors using data from the 
China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (CNHS; 2015) and derived mortality rates 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (2015). All 
three data sources were combined to estimate the life expectancy of individuals 
at age 30 years following different levels of lifestyle factors by using the 
life table method. The cause-specific decomposition of the life expectancy 
differences was analysed using Arriaga's method.
FINDINGS: After the exclusion of CKB participants with coronary heart disease, 
stroke, cancer, or missing BMI data at baseline, 487 209 were included in the 
primary analysis. Participants with COPD or asthma at baseline were additionally 
excluded for chronic respiratory disease-related analysis, leaving 451 233 
participants with data available for analysis. Data from 171 127 adults aged 
30-84 years from the CNHS 2015 were used to estimate the sex-specific and 
age-specific prevalence of lifestyle-related factors. There were 42 496 deaths 
documented over a median follow-up of 11·1 years (IQR 10·2-12·1) in CKB. The 
adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of participants adopting five versus 0-1 low-risk 
factors was 0·38 (95% CI 0·34-0·43) for all-cause mortality, aHR 0·37 
(0·30-0·46) for cardiovascular disease mortality, aHR 0·47 (0·39-0·56) for 
cancer mortality, and aHR 0·30 (0·14-0·64) for chronic respiratory disease 
mortality. The life expectancy at age 30 years for individuals with 0-1 low-risk 
factors was on average 41·7 years (95% CI 41·5-42·0) for men and 47·3 years 
(46·6-48·0) for women. For individuals with all five low-risk factors, the life 
expectancy at age 30 was 50·5 years (95% CI 48·5-52·4) for men and 55·4 years 
(53·5-57·4) for women; meaning a difference of 8·8 years (95% CI 6·8-10·7) for 
men and 8·1 years (6·5-9·9) for women. The estimated extended life expectancy 
for men and women was mainly attributable to reduced death from cardiovascular 
disease (2·4 years [27% of the total extended life expectancy] for men and 3·7 
years [46%] for women), cancer (2·6 years [30%] for men and 0·9 years [11%] for 
women), and chronic respiratory disease (0·6 years [7%] for men and 1·2 years 
[15%] for women).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that increasing the adoption of these five 
healthy lifestyle factors through public health interventions could be 
associated with substantial gains in life expectancy in the Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: As transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) replacement is increasingly used 
in patients with longer life expectancy, a sizable proportion will require redo 
TAV replacement (TAVR). The unique configuration of balloon-expandable TAV 
(bTAV) vs a self-expanding TAV (sTAV) potentially affects TAV-in-TAV outcome.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to better inform prosthesis selection, 
TAV-in-TAV outcomes were assessed according to the type of initial and 
subsequent TAV.
METHODS: Patients from the Redo-TAVR registry were analyzed using propensity 
weighting according to their initial valve type (bTAV [n = 115] vs sTAV 
[n = 106]) and subsequent valve type (bTAV [n = 130] vs sTAV [n = 91]).
RESULTS: Patients with failed bTAVs presented later (vs sTAV) (4.9 ± 2.1 years 
vs 3.7 ± 2.3 years; P < 0.001), with smaller effective orifice area (1.0 ± 
0.7 cm2 vs 1.3 ± 0.8 cm2; P = 0.018) and less frequent dominant regurgitation 
(16.2% vs 47.3%; P < 0.001). Mortality at 30 days was 2.3% (TAV-in-bTAV) vs 0% 
(TAV-in-sTAV) (P = 0.499) and 1.7% (bTAV-in-TAV) vs 1.0% (sTAV-in-TAV) 
(P = 0.612); procedural safety was 72.6% (TAV-in-bTAV) vs 71.2% (TAV-in-sTAV) 
(P = 0.817) and 73.2% (bTAV-in-TAV) vs 76.5% (sTAV-in-TAV) (P = 0.590). Device 
success was similar according to initial valve type but higher with subsequent 
sTAV vs bTAV (77.2% vs 64.3%; P = 0.045), primarily because of lower residual 
gradients (10.3 mm Hg [8.9-11.7 mm Hg] vs 15.2 mm Hg [13.2-17.1 mm Hg]; P < 
0.001). Residual regurgitation (moderate or greater) was similar after 
bTAV-in-TAV and sTAV-in-TAV (5.7%) and nominally higher after TAV-in-bTAV (9.1%) 
vs TAV-in-sTAV (4.4%) (P = 0.176).
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, no association was observed between TAV type 
and redo TAVR safety or mortality, yet subsequent sTAV was associated with 
higher device success because of lower redo gradients. These findings are 
preliminary, and more data are needed to guide valve choice for redo TAVR.

Erratum in
    Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2023 Sep 14;:

BACKGROUND: Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) confers the highest risk of death 
from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, most data refer to the early 
pandemic waves. Whole-year analysis compared with prior secular trends are 
scarce.
METHODS: We present the 2020 REMER Madrid KRT registry, corresponding to the 
Spanish Region hardest hit by COVID-19.
RESULTS: In 2020, KRT incidence decreased 12% versus 2019, while KRT prevalence 
decreased by 1.75% for the first time since records began and the number of 
kidney transplants (KTs) decreased by 16%. Mortality on KRT was 10.2% (34% 
higher than the mean for 2008-2019). The 2019-2020 increase in mortality was 
larger for KTs (+68%) than for haemodialysis (+24%) or peritoneal dialysis 
(+38%). The most common cause of death was infection [n = 419 (48% of deaths)], 
followed by cardiovascular [n = 200 (23%)]. Deaths from infection increased by 
167% year over year and accounted for 95% of excess deaths in 2020 over 2019. 
COVID-19 was the most common cause of death (68% of infection deaths, 33% of 
total deaths). The bulk of COVID-19 deaths [209/285 (73%)] occurred during the 
first COVID-19 wave, which roughly accounted for the increased mortality in 
2020. Being a KT recipient was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 negatively impacted the incidence and prevalence of KRT, 
but the increase in KRT deaths was localized to the first wave of the pandemic. 
The increased annual mortality argues against COVID-19 accelerating the death of 
patients with short life expectancy and the temporal pattern of COVID-19 
mortality suggests that appropriate healthcare may improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
that compromises the cognitive system and causes dementia. In general, AD 
affects people over 65 years old, which implies a social impact if we consider 
future projections due to the increase in life expectancy. The drugs currently 
marketed only slow the progression of the disease. In this sense, the search for 
new drugs is a relevant topic in medicinal chemistry. The therapeutic strategy 
adopted herein is the cholinergic hypothesis, for which acetylcholinesterase 
enzyme (AChE) inhibitors constitute the main treatment for the disease.
OBJECTIVE: This review compiles research in synthetic and natural compounds with 
AChE inhibitory function.
METHODS: Data were collected based on investigations of AChE inhibitors in the 
last 5 years of the 2010 decade. Synthetic and natural compounds were 
investigated, for which Ligand Based Drug Design (LBDD) and Structure Based Drug 
Design (SBDD) strategies were performed to better understand the 
structure-activity relationship of promising therapeutic agents.
RESULTS: Prediction of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties used to 
calculate the bioavailability radar, lipophilicity, drug-likeness, and 
pharmacokinetics parameters (SwissADME) indicated that most active compounds are 
associated with the following characteristics: molecular weight above 377 g/mol; 
molar refractivity over 114; fraction Csp3 below 0.39 and TPSA above 43 Å2. The 
most active compounds had a lipophilicity parameter in the range between 2.5 and 
4.52, a predominating lipophilic character. Atoms and bonds/interactions 
relevant for drug development were also investigated and the data pointed out 
the following tendencies: number of heavy atoms between 16 and 41; number of 
aromatic heavy atoms between 6 and 22; number of rotatable bonds between 1 and 
14; number of H-bond acceptors between 1 and 11; number of H-bond donors below 
7. Molecular docking studies indicated that all compounds had higher Goldscores 
than the drugs used as a positive control, indicating a stronger interaction 
with the enzyme.
CONCLUSION: The selected compounds represent a potential for new 
anticholinesterase drugs and may be good starting-point for the development of 
new candidates. Also, design rules can be extracted from our analysis.

BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is an important and serious public health problem 
worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to familiarize physicians with the evaluation, 
management, and prevention of childhood.
METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted in May, 2021, in Clinical Queries using 
the key terms "obesity" OR "obese". The search included clinical trials, 
randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, 
meta-analyses, observational studies, clinical guidelines, case reports, case 
series, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature and 
children. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the 
compilation of the present article.
RESULTS: Most obese children have exogenous obesity characterized by a growth 
rate for height above the 50th percentile, normal intelligence, normal 
genitalia, and lack of historical or physical evidence of an endocrine 
abnormality or a congenital syndrome. Obese children are at risk for 
dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease, obstructive sleep apnea, psychosocial disturbances, impaired quality of 
life, and shorter life expectancy. The multitude of serious comorbidities 
necessitates effective treatment modalities. Dietary modification, therapeutic 
exercise, and behavioral modification are the fundamentals of treatment. 
Pharmacotherapy and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for obese 
individuals who do not respond to the above measures and suffer from a serious 
comorbid condition.
CONCLUSION: Childhood obesity, once established, is often refractory to 
treatment. Most treatment programs lead to a brief period of weight loss, 
followed by rapid re-accumulation of the lost weight after the termination of 
therapy. As such, preventive activity is the key to solving the problem of 
childhood obesity. Childhood obesity can be prevented by promoting a healthy 
diet, regular physical activity, and lifestyle modification. Parents should be 
encouraged to get involved in school and community programs that improve their 
children's nutritional status and physical activity.

The B7-CD28 gene family plays a crucial role in modulating immune functions and 
has served as potential targets for immunotherapeutic strategies. Therefore, we 
systematically analyzed B7-CD28 family gene expression profiles and constructed 
a B7-CD28 family-based prognostic signature to predict survival and immune host 
status in diffuse gliomas. The TCGA dataset was used as a training cohort, and 
three CGGA datasets (mRNAseq_325, mRNAseq_693 and mRNA-array) were employed as 
validation cohorts to intensify the findings that we have revealed in TCGA 
dataset. Ultimately, we developed a B7-CD28 family-based signature that 
consisted of CD276, CD274, PDCD1LG2 and CD80 using LASSO Cox analysis. This gene 
signature was validated to have significant prognostic value, and could be used 
as a biomarker to distinguish pathological grade and IDH mutation status in 
diffuse glioma. Additionally, we found that the gene signature was significantly 
related to intensity of immune response and immune cell population, as well as 
several other important immune checkpoint genes, holding a great potential to be 
a predictive immune marker for immunotherapy and tumor microenvironment. 
Finally, a B7-CD28 family-based nomogram was established to predict patient life 
expectancy contributing to facilitate personalizing therapy for tumor sufferers. 
In summary, this is the first mathematical model based on this gene family with 
the aim of providing novel insights into immunotherapy for diffuse glioma.

Life expectancy of multiple myeloma (MM) patients has improved in last years due 
to the advent of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies in combination with 
immunomodulators and proteasome inhibitors. However, morbidity and mortality 
related to infections remain high and represent a major concern. This paper 
describes the "real life" risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in patients 
treated with daratumumab-based therapy and reviews the relevant literature. In a 
series of 75 patients we only observed three cases of fungal pneumonia. 
Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms were not specific for fungal 
infection. Diagnostic imaging, microbiology and patient history, especially 
previous therapies, are critical in the decision to start antifungal treatment. 
Recognising the subgroup of MM patients with high risk of IFI can increase the 
rate of diagnosis, adequate treatment and MM-treatment recovery.

Cerebral microangiopathy (CM) has become a common disease related to improved 
neuroimaging modalities and an increased life expectancy. Intracerebral 
tumor-like mass lesions have rarely been reported in cases of cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA) in elderly patients. However, tumor-like mass lesions from CM 
without amyloid deposits have rarely been reported. These two angiopathies may 
have different pathogeneses and neuroimaging characteristics. Herein, we present 
the case of an 83-year-old man with CM mimicking a high-grade glioma. We 
described the possible pathogenesis and different neuroimaging features of CM 
compared to CAA.

The gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease of 
apple and pear trees. The exopolysaccharide amylovoran and lipopolysaccharides 
are essential E. amylovora virulence factors. Production of amylovoran and 
lipopolysaccharide is specified in part by genes that are members of long 
operons. Here, we show that full virulence of E. amylovora in apple fruitlets 
and tree shoots depends on the predicted transcription antiterminator RfaH. RfaH 
reduces pausing in the production of long transcripts having an operon polarity 
suppressor regulatory element within their promoter region. In E. amylovora, 
only the amylovoran operon and a lipopolysaccharide operon have such regulatory 
elements within their promoter regions and in the correct orientation. These 
operons showed dramatically increased polarity in the ΔrfaH mutant compared to 
the wild type as determined by RNA sequencing. Amylovoran and lipopolysaccharide 
production in vitro was reduced in rfaH mutants compared to the wild type, which 
probably contributes to the rfaH mutant virulence phenotype. Furthermore, type 
VI secretion cluster 1, which contributes to E. amylovora virulence, showed 
reduced expression in ΔrfaH compared to the wild type, although without an 
increase in polarity. The data suggest that E. amylovora RfaH directly, 
specifically, and exclusively suppresses operon polarity in the amylovoran 
operon and a lipopolysaccharide operon.

Lysosomes are cell organelles that degrade macromolecules to recycle their 
components. If lysosomal degradative function is impaired, e.g., due to 
mutations in lysosomal enzymes or membrane proteins, lysosomal storage diseases 
(LSDs) can develop. LSDs manifest often with neurodegenerative symptoms, 
typically starting in early childhood, and going along with a strongly reduced 
life expectancy and quality of life. We show here that small molecule activation 
of the Ca2+ -permeable endolysosomal two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) results in an 
amelioration of cellular phenotypes associated with LSDs such as cholesterol or 
lipofuscin accumulation, or the formation of abnormal vacuoles seen by electron 
microscopy. Rescue effects by TPC2 activation, which promotes lysosomal 
exocytosis and autophagy, were assessed in mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), 
Niemann-Pick type C1, and Batten disease patient fibroblasts, and in neurons 
derived from newly generated isogenic human iPSC models for MLIV and Batten 
disease. For in vivo proof of concept, we tested TPC2 activation in the MLIV 
mouse model. In sum, our data suggest that TPC2 is a promising target for the 
treatment of different types of LSDs, both in vitro and in-vivo.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the responsiveness of EQ-5D-3L 
(3L) with EQ-5D-5L (5L) descriptive systems and value sets in two independent 
samples (rehabilitation and stroke patients).
METHODS: Descriptive system results were compared cross-sectionally, and 
descriptive responsiveness was tested by calculating changed level responses 
('moves') from baseline to follow-up, proportion of improved patients, Paretian 
Classification of Health Change (PCHC), and probability of superiority (PS). 
Responsiveness of values based on nine country-specific value sets was assessed 
by standardized response mean (SRM) and standardized effect size (SES). Relative 
efficiency of 5L over 3L was assessed by calculating ratios of the SRM and SES 
statistics.
RESULTS: Descriptive comparisons confirmed earlier evidence and showed a 
consistent overestimation of health problems in 3L. Descriptive responsiveness 
improved with 5L in terms of moves per respondent, proportions of improved 
patients and PS, whereas PCHC showed mixed results. Better value responsiveness 
statistics were observed for 5L in rehabilitation patients for all value sets. 
In stroke patients, 3L showed better responsiveness statistics compared with 5L. 
Relative efficiency results were moderately to strongly better with 5L for 
rehabilitation, and slightly to moderately better with 3L for stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Descriptive results were the main driver of 3L-5L responsiveness 
differences. Responsiveness of 3L was influenced by the 'confined to bed' label 
and the overestimation bias of 3L, which affected all responsiveness results. 
This may impact quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimations, leading to over- 
or underestimations of QALYs gained, depending on the condition and condition 
severity. QALY calculations based on 5L data will result in more accurate 
estimates.

The current study aims to investigate factors affecting life expectancy in 
Pakistan with a special focus on environmental degradation measured by carbon 
emissions (CO2 emissions) on life expectancy from 1975 to 2020. The unit root 
test results show mixed order integration in the series. The bound F-test and 
Johansen cointegration test confirm the long-run association between the 
variables. The long-run estimates of autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) 
reveal that CO2 emissions, inflation rate, food production index, and death rate 
have negative effects on the life expectancy, implying that life expectancy 
shorten when CO2 increases, while per capita income, urbanization, population 
growth, birth rate, health expenditure, and education have positive effects on 
life expectancy, indicating that these factors prolong life expectancy. 
Moreover, the short-run estimates of ARDL reveal that food production index, 
urbanization, birth rate, infant mortality rate, and education have positive 
effects on the life expectancy, while inflation, per capita income, population 
growth rate, death rate, health expenditure, and CO2 emissions have negative 
effects on the life expectancy. The findings of the study suggest that the 
management authorities need to regulate carbon emissions in order to prolong 
life expectancy which is a key determinant of the economic growth.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and 
severe psychiatric disorder that has enormous economical and societal costs. As 
pharmacogenetics is one of the key tools of precision psychiatry, we analyze the 
cost-utility of test screening of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 for patients suffering from 
major depressive disorder (MDD) and try to understand the main drivers that 
influence the cost-utility.
METHODS: We developed two pharmacoeconomic nonhomogeneous Markov models to test 
the cost-utility, from an Italian societal perspective, of pharmacogenetic 
testing genetic to characterize the metabolizing profiles of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6 in a hypothetical case study of patients suffering from 
major depressive disorder (MDD). The model considers different scenarios of 
adjustment of antidepressant treatment according to the patient's metabolizing 
profile or treatment over a period of 18 weeks. The uncertainty of model 
parameters is tested through both a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and a 
one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, and these results are used in a 
post-hoc analysis to understand the main drivers of three alternative 
cost-effectiveness levels ("poor," "standard," and "high"). These drivers are 
first evaluated from an exploratory multidimensional perspective and next from a 
predictive perspective as the probability that a patient belongs to a specific 
cost-effectiveness level is estimated on the basis of a restricted set of 
parameters used in the original pharmacoeconomic model.
RESULTS: The models for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 indicate that screening has an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 60,000€ and 47,000€ per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY), respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows 
that the treatments are cost-effective for a 75,000€ willingness to pay (WTP) 
threshold in 58% and 63% of the Monte Carlo replications, respectively. The 
post-hoc analysis highlights the factors that allow us to clearly discriminates 
poor cost-effectiveness from high cost-effectiveness scenarios and demonstrates 
that it is possible to predict with reasonable accuracy the cost-effectiveness 
of a genetic test and the associated therapeutic pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that screenings for both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 
enzymes for patients with MDD are cost-effective for a WTP threshold of 75,000€ 
per QALY, and provide relevant suggestions about the most important aspects to 
be further explored in clinical studies aimed at addressing the 
cost-effectiveness of genetic testing for patients diagnosed with MDD.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease can impose substantial distress and costs on 
patients, their families and caregivers, and health care systems. To address 
these burdens for families and health care systems, there is a need to better 
support patient self-management. To achieve this, an overview of the current 
state of the literature on self-management is needed to identify what is being 
done, how well it is working, and what might be missing.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of the 
current body of research on self-management interventions for people with 
Parkinson disease and identify any knowledge gaps.
METHODS: The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and Population, Intervention, 
Comparator, Outcome, and Study type frameworks were used to structure the 
methodology of the review. Due to time and resource constraints, 1 reviewer 
systematically searched 4 databases (PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science) 
for the evaluations of self-management interventions for Parkinson disease 
published in English. The references were screened using the EndNote X9 citation 
management software, titles and abstracts were manually reviewed, and studies 
were selected for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. Data were 
extracted into a pre-established form and synthesized in a descriptive analysis.
RESULTS: There was variation among the studies on study design, sample size, 
intervention type, and outcomes measured. The randomized controlled trials had 
the strongest evidence of effectiveness: 5 out of 8 randomized controlled trials 
found a significant difference between groups favoring the intervention on their 
primary outcome, and the remaining 3 had significant effects on at least some of 
the secondary outcomes. The 2 interventions included in the review that targeted 
mental health outcomes both found significant changes over time, and the 3 
algorithms evaluated performed well. The remaining studies examined patient 
perceptions, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness and found generally positive 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified a wide variety of interventions 
designed to support various aspects of self-management for people with Parkinson 
disease. The studies all generally reported positive results, and although the 
strength of the evidence varied, it suggests that self-management interventions 
are promising for improving the care and outcomes of people with Parkinson 
disease. However, the research tended to focus on the motor aspects of Parkinson 
disease, with few nonmotor or holistic interventions, and there was a lack of 
evaluation of cost-effectiveness. This research will be important to providing 
self-management interventions that meet the varied and diverse needs of people 
with Parkinson disease and determining which interventions are worth promoting 
for widespread adoption.

INTRODUCTION: Proximal femoral fractures are common in frail institutionalised 
older patients. No convincing evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment 
strategy for those with a limited pre-fracture life expectancy, underpinning the 
importance of shared decision-making (SDM). This study investigated healthcare 
providers' barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of SDM.
METHODS: Dutch healthcare providers completed an adapted version of the 
Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations questionnaire to identify 
barriers and facilitators. If ≥20% of participants responded with 'totally 
disagree/disagree', items were considered barriers and, if ≥80% responded with 
'agree/totally agree', items were considered facilitators.
RESULTS: A total of 271 healthcare providers participated. Five barriers and 23 
facilitators were identified. Barriers included the time required to both 
prepare for and hold SDM conversations, in addition to the reflective period 
required to allow patients/relatives to make their final decision, and the 
number of parties required to ensure optimal SDM. Facilitators were related to 
patients' values, wishes and satisfaction, the importance of SDM for 
patients/relatives and the fact that SDM is not considered complex by healthcare 
providers, is considered to be part of routine care and is believed to be 
associated with positive patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of identified facilitators and barriers is an important 
step in expanding the use of SDM. Implementation strategies should be aimed at 
managing time constraints. High-quality evidence on outcomes of non-operative 
and operative management can enhance implementation of SDM to address current 
concerns around the outcomes.

We have recently demonstrated that coated exfoliated Egyptian blue powder is 
effective for detecting latent fingermarks on a range of highly-patterned 
non-porous and semi-porous surfaces. In this extension of that work, we present 
our studies into an alternative approach to prepare exfoliated Egyptian blue 
coated with cetrimonium bromide and Tween® 20 using a simpler technique. The 
quality of the latent fingermarks developed with these exfoliated powders and 
the commercial powder were compared in acomprehensive study. Depletion series of 
natural fingermarks from a wide range of donors (12 males and females) deposited 
on non-porous (glass slides) and semi-porous (Australian banknotes) surfaces 
were used in this study. Enhancement in the performance of the coated exfoliated 
particles compared to the commercial powder was observed, particularly in the 
case of aged fingermarks and polymer banknotes as challenging substrates.
