group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of IT compared to 
ST on 1-year survival (HR = 2.1 95%CI[1.1-4.8], p = 0.003). IT showed a 
significantly higher survival gain over ST in those patients showing KRAS 
mutation (7.6 VS 0.8 months,<0.0001), a lumen occlusion >65% (6.6 VS 2.9 
months,<0.001), and lacking the involvement of left bronchus (7 VS 2.3 
months,<0.0001). Compared to ST, IT also showed a favorable difference in terms 
of new hospitalizations (p = 0.03), symptom-free interval (p = 0.02), and onset 
of atelectasis (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NSCLC stage IIIB and CAO, additional 
interventional bronchoscopy might impact on 1-year survival. Genetic and 
anatomic phenotyping might allow identifying those patients who may gain life 
expectancy from the endoscopic intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 
Version 2 (UKPDS-OM2) the impact of delaying type 2 diabetes onset on costs and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy using trial participants who developed diabetes 
in the NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance 
Outcomes Research) study.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We simulated the impact of delaying diabetes onset 
by 1-9 years, utilizing data from the 3,058 of 9,306 NAVIGATOR trial 
participants who developed type 2 diabetes. Costs and utility weights associated 
with diabetes and diabetes-related complications were obtained for the U.S. and 
U.K. settings, with costs expressed in 2017 values. We estimated discounted 
lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: Gains in QALYs increased from 0.02 (U.S. setting, 95% CI 0.01, 0.03) to 
0.15 (U.S. setting, 95% CI 0.10, 0.21) as the imposed time to diabetes onset was 
increased from 1 to 9 years, respectively. Savings in complication costs 
increased from $1,388 (95% CI $1,092, $1,669) for a 1-year delay to $8,437 (95% 
CI $6,611, $10,197) for a delay of 9 years. Interventions costing up to 
$567-$2,680 and £201-£947 per year would be cost-effective at $100,000 per QALY 
and £20,000 per QALY thresholds in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as the 
modeled delay in diabetes onset was increased from 1 to 9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulating a hypothetical diabetes-delaying intervention provides 
guidance concerning the maximum cost and minimum delay in diabetes onset needed 
to be cost-effective. These results can inform the ongoing debate about diabetes 
prevention strategies and the design of future intervention studies.

Billfishes are well known for their distinctive elongated rostra, i.e. bills. 
The functional significance of billfish rostra has been frequently discussed and 
the recent discovery of an oil gland (glandula oleofera) at the base of the 
rostrum in swordfish, Xiphias gladius, has added an interesting facet to this 
discussion regarding the potential co-evolution of gland and rostra. Here, we 
investigated the oil gland and oil pores (through which the oil is brought to 
the skin surface) of four billfish species - swordfish, Atlantic blue marlin 
(Makaira nigricans), Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) and striped 
marlin (Kajikia audax) - and provide detailed evidence for the presence of an 
oil gland in the last three. All four species had a high density of oil pores on 
the forehead which is consistent with the hypothesis of hydrodynamic benefits of 
the oil. The extension of the pores onto the front half of the rostrum in 
sailfish and striped marlin, but not in swordfish or blue marlin, suggests that 
the oil may have additional functions. One such function could be linked to the 
antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of the oil. However, the 
available evidence on predatory rostrum use (and hence the likelihood of tissue 
damage) is only partly consistent with the extension of pores on rostra across 
species. We conclude that the oil gland probably serves multiple, non-mutually 
exclusive functions. More detailed information on rostrum use in blue marlin and 
swordfish is needed to better link behavioural and morphological data with the 
aim of accomplishing a full comparative analysis.

Lung resection surgery (LRS) causes an intense local and systemic inflammatory 
response. There is a relationship between inflammation and postoperative 
complications (POCs). Also, it has been proposed that the inflammation and 
complications related with the surgery may promote the recurrence of cancer and 
therefore deterioration of survival. We investigated the association between 
inflammatory biomarkers, severity of POCs and long-term outcome in patients who 
were discharged after LRS. This is a prospective substudy of a randomized 
control trial. We established three groups based in the presence of POCs 
evaluated by Clavien-Dindo (C-D) classification: Patients with no postoperative 
complications (No-POCs group) (C-D = 0), patients who developed light POCs 
(L-POCs group) (C-D = I-II), and major POCs (M-POCs group) (C-D = III, IV, or 
V). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression model were created to compare 
survival and oncologic recurrence in those groups. Patients who developed POCs 
(light or major) had an increase in some inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6, 
IL-7, IL-8) compared with No-POCs group. This pro-inflammatory status plays a 
fundamental role in the appearance of POCs and therefore in a shorter life 
expectancy. Individuals in the M-POCs group had a higher risk of death 
(HR = 3.59, 95% CI 1.69 to 7.63) compared to individuals in the No-POCs group 
(p = 0.001). Patients of L-POCs group showed better survival than M-POCs group 
(HR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.65, p = 0.049). Besides, M-POCs patients had higher 
risk of recurrence in the first 2 years, when compared with L-POCs (p = 0,008) 
or with No-POCs (p = 0.002). In patients who are discharged after undergoing 
oncologic LRS, there is an association between POCs occurrence and long term 
outcome. Oncologist should pay special attention in patients who develop POCs 
after LRS.

INTRODUCTION: We have been conducting an evaluation of innovative therapies in 
patients with SLE during the past 15 years. We combine the results observed on 
extension studies from four different trials in patients receiving either 
intravenous or subcutaneous belimumab, and evaluated, in Caucasian and Black 
Brazilian patients.
METHODS: Seventy-four patients were part of the study. The Lupus Low Disease 
Activity State (LLDAS) shown to be an available tool to detect a response in 
trials was used in this study and statistical comparisons between the different 
result groups were determined. The period of evaluation was from 12 to 
48 months.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients completed the initial study. Four refused to 
continue the extension evaluation. Seven belonged to the black group (10%); 
sixty-three were Caucasian (90%). One patient was discontinued due to pregnancy. 
Nine received a subcutaneous presentation (12.8%). In the subgroup analysis, one 
patient in the black group had flare (14.2%); five in the intravenous 
administration had severe flares (8.1%) and were discontinued. Ten had flares 
adjusted with steroids (eight articular or skin reactivation) and two with renal 
disease. Of the five severe flares, two required hospitalization. The mean time 
duration to achieve LLDAS was 6 months. Twenty-seven achieved a steroid-free 
status and the remaining two patients on 2.5 mg and seventeen were stable on 
daily 5.0  mg of prednisone.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the LLDAS, it was possible to show that the majority of 
patients receiving belimumab for prolonged periods go into remission 
steroid-free or in low disease activity in association with the corresponding 
immunosuppressive treatment. Key Points • Prolonged real-life evaluation 
confirms the efficacy and steroid-sparing of Belimumab in SLE patients with 
active disease.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a group of recessively inherited blood 
disorders and is the most common genetic disorder in the world (Embury et al., 
1994). It is a chronic condition of variable severity that mainly affects people 
of African and African-Caribbean heritage. Over the last 20 years life 
expectancy has increased significantly, particularly for patients receiving 
western healthcare so that increasing attention has been directed to the 
psychosocial adaptation and neurocognitive profile of children and adolescents 
with SCD. Previously, research suggested that, like children with other chronic 
health conditions, children and adolescents with SCD were at increased risk for 
emotional and behavioural disorders. More recent research has not demonstrated 
increased rates of such difficulties. Increasing evidence suggests that children 
with severe disease are, however, at significantly increased risk for 
cerebro-vascular events and neurocognitive difficulties. This paper reviews the 
literature regarding the psychological and neurocognitive functioning of 
children with SCD and outlines a number of ways that psychological input may 
significantly contribute to more effective health care for these children and 
their families.

Can Phase Angle in Newborns at Neonatal Intensive Care Units Be an Indicator of 
Mortality and Prognosis?

Paraná, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: The bioelectrical impedance (BI) phase angle (PA), analyzed directly 
through BI analysis (BIA), is determined by tissue cellularity, representing a 
direct measure of cellular stability and, for this reason, has been studied and 
considered as an indicator of prognosis and nutrition status in adults and 
children.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine if PA can be an indicator of mortality and 
prognosis in newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
METHODS: Transversal study conducted at a public NICU in Curitiba, Paraná, 
Brazil. All newborns, preterm and term, were considered eligible for the study 
if admission to the NICU occurred by the first hour of life. The Score for 
Neonatal Acute Physiology II, as well as the Perinatal Extension version, were 
developed to assess the risk of mortality for all newborns, measured within 
12 hours of admission. BIA measurements were conducted using the tetrapolar 
BioScan Maltron 916, with single-frequency (50 kHz) tetrapolar BI. PA was 
calculated as the arc tangent: (Xc/R) x 180°/π.
RESULTS: BIA was measured during the first 24 hours of admission for all 
newborns (n = 93), repeated between 24 and 48 hours (n = 79) and again after 7 
days (n = 55), always when possible. PA measurements decreased in the first 
48 hours in premature newborns, particularly among those who died. The premature 
newborns also showed a significant decrease from the first to the last PA 
measurement (P = .001). In addition, whereas full-term newborns showed an 
increase of PA at 1 week of life, preterm infants continued to have a decrease 
in values. For preterm newborns, PA measurements decreased and more sharply so 
for those who died. This result should be viewed with caution given the small 
number of deaths, but it should be investigated to understand the role of PA in 
the prognosis of NICU newborns.
CONCLUSIONS: The absolute value of PA during the first 24 hours of life was not 
a good marker for severity or mortality. However, the decrease of PA between 
different moments of evaluation was a good marker of severity. The decrease of 
PA in the first 48 hours in premature newborns, and that when the decrease is 
more pronounced, may be indicative of mortality. The difference in PA values 
between these newborns is probably a significant variable for mortality and 
prognosis and not a cutoff value.

Surgery should be considered for patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord 
compression (MESCC) with a life expectancy of ≥3 months. Given the heterogeneity 
of the clinical presentation and outcomes, clinical prognostic models (CPMs) can 
assist in tailoring a personalized medicine approach to optimize surgical 
decision-making. We aimed to develop and internally validate the first CPM of 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and a novel CPM to predict the survival 
of patients with MESCC treated surgically. Using data from 258 patients (AOSpine 
North America MESCC study and Nottingham MESCC registry), we created 1-year 
survival and HRQoL CPMs using a Cox model and logistic regression analysis with 
manual backward elimination. The outcome measure for HRQoL was the minimal 
clinical important difference in EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire scores. 
Internal validation involved 200 bootstrap iterations, and calibration and 
discrimination were evaluated. Longer survival was associated with a higher 
SF-36 physical component score (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96). In contrast, primary 
tumor other than breast, thyroid, or prostate (unfavorable: HR, 2.57; other: HR, 
1.20), organ metastasis (HR, 1.51), male sex (HR, 1.58), and preoperative 
radiotherapy (HR, 1.53) were not (c-statistic, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 
0.64-0.73). Karnofsky performance status <70% (odds ratio [OR], 2.50), living in 
North America (OR, 4.06), SF-36 physical component score (OR, 0.95) and SF-36 
mental component score (OR, 0.96) were associated with the likelihood of 
achieving a minimal clinical important difference improvement in the EuroQol 
5-Dimension Questionnaire score at 3 months (c-statistic, 0.74; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.68-0.79). The calibration for both CPMs was very good. We developed 
and internally validated the first CPMs of survival and HRQoL at 3 months 
postoperatively in patients with MESCC using the TRIPOD (transparent reporting 
of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) 
guidelines. A web-based calculator is available (available at: 
http://spine-met.com) to assist with clinical decision-making.

PURPOSE: Gleason score (GS), as well as other prognostic and diagnostic 
modalities, can predict the possibility of tumor growth and metastasis during 
the life of patients with prostate cancer. Based on the prostate biopsy GS, 
clinicians choose the most appropriate therapy for managing patients. The 
objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the discrepancy between 
needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy GS and to identify its predictive 
factors among the Iranian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1147 patients who underwent radical 
prostatectomy from 2009 to 2019 were initially enrolled in this study. After 
consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 439 patients were finally 
included. The demographic variables and clinical data including age, PSA level, 
prostate volume, PSA density, GS derived from ultrasonography-guided core needle 
biopsy specimen, and GS derived from radical prostatectomy specimen were 
collected from the medical records of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and 
were reviewed by a urology resident. Statistical analysis was done by using the 
Social Sciences Software version 21.
RESULTS: The average age of patients was 64.5 years (range 48-84 years), and the 
average preoperative PSA level was 14.8 ng/mL. On histopathological examination, 
no changes in GS were observed in 237 (53.9%) patients, whereas GS was upgraded 
in 144 (32.8%) patients and downgraded in 58 (13.2%) patients at radical 
prostatectomy. The number of patients who had extracapsular extension, seminal 
vesicle invasion and positive lymph nodes was significantly higher in the 
upgraded group compared with the non-upgraded group.  Conclusion: In this study, 
there was a steady decrease in GS upgrading with the prostate size extending up 
to 49.7 g. There was also an association between downgrading and extending 
prostate size. Due to the greater risk of high-grade disease in men with small 
prostates, smaller prostate bulks are most probably upgraded after radical 
prostatectomy. A higher maximum percentage of involvement per core was an 
independent predictive factor of upgrading from biopsy grade 1 to grade ≥ 2. Our 
study showed that patients' age was not predictive of upgrading, which is 
consistent with other studies. Also, we demonstrated a non-significant 
relationship between PSA level and upgraded GS. Findings in this study did not 
demonstrate a significant relationship between PSA level and upgrading.

Chronic pancreatitis is a multifactorial, fibroinflammatory syndrome in which 
repetitive episodes of pancreatic inflammation lead to extensive fibrotic tissue 
replacement, resulting in chronic pain, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency, reduced quality of life, and a shorter life expectancy. The 
incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis is rising and no curative 
treatment is available. Using novel diagnostic algorithms, definitive chronic 
pancreatitis can be diagnosed by imaging criteria alone, whereas probable 
chronic pancreatitis requires clinical features and imaging criteria. Criteria 
for the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis are still under discussion and 
need prospective validation in clinical trials. Cross-sectional imaging should 
be used first; endoscopic ultrasound is needed only when CT or MRI are 
inconclusive or to plan therapeutic interventions. Management of chronic 
pancreatitis requires an interdisciplinary approach including primary care 
practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pain specialists, 
and nutritional therapists. Patients with chronic pancreatitis should be seen at 
least once a year and re-evaluated for causal risk factors, symptom control, and 
complications such as malnutrition, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and 
diabetes; refer to a specialised centre if symptoms are poorly controlled or 
there is risk of deterioration. Scoring systems to monitor disease progression 
have been developed and validated internationally. Interventional treatments for 
pain or cholestasis should be done by specialists only, and early discussion of 
treatment approaches should include all medical disciplines involved in care. 
Throughout this Seminar, we address research needs such as staging of 
pancreatitis, aspects of malnutrition and pain, and cancer surveillance, to help 
improve the care of patients.

The RNA world hypothesis, although a viable one regarding the origin of life on 
earth, has so far failed to provide a compelling explanation for the synthesis 
of RNA enzymes from free nucleotides via abiotic processes. To tackle this 
long-standing problem, we develop a realistic model for the onset of the RNA 
world, using experimentally determined rates for polymerization reactions. We 
start with minimal assumptions about the initial state that only requires the 
presence of short oligomers or just free nucleotides and consider the effects of 
environmental cycling by dividing a day into a dry, semi-wet and wet phases that 
are distinguished by the nature of reactions they support. Long polymers, with 
maximum lengths sometimes exceeding 100 nucleotides, spontaneously emerge due to 
a combination of non-enzymatic, non-templated polymer extension and 
template-directed primer extension processes. The former helps in increasing the 
lengths of RNA strands, whereas the later helps in producing complementary 
copies of the strands. Strands also undergo hydrolysis in a structure-dependent 
manner that favour breaking of bonds connecting unpaired nucleotides. We 
identify the most favourable conditions needed for the emergence of ribozyme and 
tRNA-like structures and double stranded RNA molecules, classify all RNA strands 
on the basis of their secondary structures and determine their abundance in the 
population. Our results indicate that under suitable environmental conditions, 
non-enzymatic processes would have been sufficient to lead to the emergence of a 
variety of ribozyme-like molecules with complex secondary structures and 
potential catalytic functions.

Religious coping is prevalent among individuals diagnosed with psychotic 
disorders, however its clinical relevance has been insufficiently studied. 
Thirty ultra-Orthodox Jewish patients experiencing current psychotic symptoms 
and receiving treatment in the inpatient and day-care units were administered 
measures assessing severity of psychotic symptoms, psychological 
distress/well-being, beliefs about treatment credibility/expectancy, and aspects 
of religious belief and coping. Among men, negative religious coping was 
associated with lower treatment credibility. Among women, positive religious 
coping was associated with increased treatment expectancy and greater quality of 
life; and trust in God was associated with reduced psychiatric symptoms and 
greater treatment expectancy. Study findings indicate that religious factors may 
promote treatment motivation and engagement, crucial factors for subpopulations 
facing culturally-based barriers to treatment, as well as boost more favorable 
outcomes. Sensitivity to religious factors in treatment appears to play an 
important role in the management of psychotic disorders and should be engaged 
when culturally appropriate in order to maximize treatment potential.

Although useful spermatozoa cryopreservation techniques have been established, 
long-term equilibration seems to be required before freezing the spermatozoa of 
many species, including dogs. The fertility of cryopreserved dog spermatozoa 
from five males for a reduced equilibration period (0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min) 
in a skim milk (SM)-based extender containing raffinose was evaluated in the 
present study. When the sperm was diluted with the extender at room temperature 
(RT) and cryopreserved without equilibration, the proportion of total motile 
spermatozoa (TMS) after thawing was lower (27%) than when the sperm was 
equilibrated for 30 min (33%), 60 min (32%), 120 min (44%; p < .05) or 180 min 
(29%). The proportion of TMS increased as the equilibration time increased and 
peaked at 120 min. Acrosome integrity was significantly lower in the 
cryopreserved spermatozoa that had not undergone the initial equilibration than 
in the equilibrated spermatozoa (p < .05). The normal rate of acrosomes 
increased with the extension of the first equilibration and peaked at 120 min. 
When frozen-thawed spermatozoa that had been diluted at RT and subjected to an 
initial equilibration lasting 60 or 180 min were transcervically inseminated 
into recipients, there were no differences in the delivery rate, litter size or 
breeding efficiency. In the cryopreservation of canine spermatozoa using a 
SM-based extender, even if the initial equilibration time was shortened to 
60 min, the results were comparable to those obtained when the conventional 
method (with an initial equilibration time of 180 min) was used.

Systematic Review of the Evolution of Health-Economic Evaluation Models of 
Osteoarthritis.

OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively synthesize the evolution of health-economic 
evaluation models (HEEMs) of all osteoarthritis (OA) interventions, including 
preventions, core treatments, adjunct nonpharmacologic interventions, 
pharmacologic interventions, and surgical treatments.
METHODS: The literature was searched within health-economic/biomedical 
databases. Data extracted included OA type, population characteristics, model 
setting/type/events, study perspective, and comparators; the reporting quality 
of the studies was also assessed. The review protocol was registered at the 
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018092937).
RESULTS: Eighty-eight studies were included. Pharmacologic and surgical 
interventions were the focus in 51% and 44% of studies, respectively. 
Twenty-four studies adopted a societal perspective (with increasing popularity 
after 2013), but most (63%) did not include indirect costs. Quality-adjusted 
life years was the most popular outcome measure since 2008. Markov models were 
used by 62% of studies, with increasing popularity since 2008. Until 2010, most 
studies used short-to-medium time horizons; subsequently, a lifetime horizon 
became popular. A total of 86% of studies reported discount rates (predominantly 
between 3% and 5%). Studies published after 2002 had a better coverage of 
OA-related adverse events (AEs). Reporting quality significantly improved after 
2001.
CONCLUSION: OA HEEMs have evolved and improved substantially over time, with the 
focus shifting from short-to-medium-term pharmacologic decision-tree models to 
surgical-focused lifetime Markov models. Indirect costs of OA are frequently not 
considered, despite using a societal perspective. There was a lack of reporting 
sensitivity of model outcome to input parameters, including discount rate, OA 
definition, and population parameters. While the coverage of OA-related AEs has 
improved over time, it is still not comprehensive.

Invasive interventional procedures for managing pain in cancer patients are 
often underutilized following the popularization of the WHO analgesic ladder. 
The procedures that were successfully used until then were relegated away from 
mainstream palliative care practice, with the advent of newer opioids and 
adjuvants. Even though nerve blocks, intrathecal pumps and spinal cord 
stimulation were reintroduced as the fourth step of the WHO ladder, often 
referrals for these procedures are too late to produce a meaningful effect on 
quality of life. At this point most patients have advanced disease and are 
requiring end of life care. Additionally, it is becoming evident that at least 
10% of patients do not achieve good quality analgesia with oral opioids and are 
often troubled by unacceptable side effects. There is an increasing public 
awareness of the problems with long-term opioid therapy and some of these 
patients would certainly benefit from invasive procedures to alleviate their 
pain and improve their quality of life. Improving life quality and expectancy 
with better treatment options and increasing number of cancer survivors should 
be heralding a change and hence neurolytic procedures are to be used only in 
patients with limited life expectancy. ITDDs, neuromodulation and 
ever-increasing use of procedures routinely used in treating chronic 
nonmalignant pain would be the mainstay of interventional management until AI 
and nanotechnology would open doors for novel treatment options. Interventions 
should not be used as a last resort after multiple failed attempts at opioid 
therapy, but as an integral part of a management strategy including medical 
management, psychological and emotional welfare, and supportive care of the 
patient in a holistic manner. The curriculum of specialists should include 
appropriate training to safely perform and produce better quality evidence to 
validate the efficacy and safety of these challenging procedures.

HIV infection has now become a chronic disease with a good life expectancy 
thanks to antiretrovirals. The mortality currently is attributed to other 
pathologies in particular cardiovascular because of the inflammation and the 
side effects of the drugs. All arteries can be damaged in HIV, especially the 
aorta, with several types of lesions which can be occlusive, aneurysmal, 
dissecting, even with the cases of arteriovenous fistula which have been 
described. HIV occlusive arterial disease is different from atheromatous disease 
in HIV-free patients and this is confirmed by pathology and ultrasound studies, 
which makes it more difficult to manage HIV-related occlusions. The open 
surgical treatment especially in the acute forms is disappointing with 
complications of rethrombosis and infectious and of sepsis of prosthesis 
considering the immunosuppression, the endovascular treatment begins to become 
the treatment of choice in the aneurysmal pathology and probably it would be in 
the future for occlusive disease.

jitu@vohra1.com.

In patients with schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease accounts for nearly 50% 
of deaths and decreased life expectancy, and the incidence of sudden cardiac 
death is about four times higher than in the background population. While the 
majority of sudden deaths are due to ischaemic heart disease and its recognised 
risk factors, about 10% of sudden deaths are unexplained and are thought to be 
due to cardiac arrhythmias. This review discusses various factors that might 
contribute to this increased mortality, such as the effect of antipsychotic 
drugs on potassium and sodium channel function, increased incidence of Brugada 
pattern in patients with schizophrenia and the role of the autonomic nervous 
system. It stresses the control of traditional coronary risk factors and 
discusses various noninvasive tests to identify patients at risk. It also 
mentions the reported association for nonsynonymous genetic polymorphism 
rs10503929 within the neuregulin 1 gene (NRG1) and the minor allele C and its 
role in the risk of sudden cardiac death in schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION: Fibrous dysplasia is a benign disorder, in which normal bone is 
replaced by fibrosis and immature bone trabeculae, showing a similar 
distribution between the genders, and being more prevalent in the earlier 
decades of life. Fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone is a rare condition, and 
there is no consensus as to whether it is more common in monostotic or 
polyostotic forms. External auditory meatus stenosis and conductive dysacusis 
are the most common manifestations, with cholesteatoma being a common 
complication, whereas the involvement of the otic capsule is an unusual one. 
Surgical treatment is indicated to control pain or dysacusis, otorrhea, 
cholesteatoma, and deformity.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical experience of a tertiary referral hospital 
with cases of fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone.
METHODS: Sampling of patients diagnosed with fibrous dysplasia of the temporal 
bone, confirmed by tomography, treated at the pediatric otology and 
otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinics, between 2015 and 2018. The assessed 
variables were age, gender, laterality, external auditory meatus stenosis, 
deformity, hearing loss, presence of secondary cholesteatoma of the external 
auditory meatus, lesion extension and management.
RESULTS: Five patients were included, four females and one male, with age 
ranging from 13 to 34 years. Three had the polyostotic form and two the 
monostotic form of fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone. Four patients had 
local deformity and external auditory meatus stenosis, two of which progressed 
to cholesteatoma. All patients showed some degree of hearing impairment. All had 
preserved otic capsule at the tomography. Two patients are currently undergoing 
clinical observation; two were submitted to tympanomastoidectomy due to 
secondary cholesteatoma; one was submitted to lesion resection, aiming to 
control the dysacusis progression.
CONCLUSION: Five cases of fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone were described, 
a rare disorder of which the otologist should be aware.

Frailty has been studied as a valuable predictor of adverse health events and 
poor postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery. Thus, the use of 
simple and adapted indexes to define frailty, like the modified frailty index 
(Mfi)-11, proved useful in assessing patients undergoing vascular surgery. The 
role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) continues to be debated in the age of 
optimal medical therapy, particularly for patients with limited life expectancy 
(Rothenberg et al., 2020) [3]. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) measures frailty, a 
syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve, which increases vulnerability to 
adverse outcomes. However, the literature about the applicability of an even 
more pragmatic index, the modified frailty (mFi) index mFI-5 in vascular 
patients is scarce, particularly in those submitted to carotid endarterectomy 
(CEA). This study aimed to validate and estimate the prognostic value of the 
mFI-5 on the postoperative period and long-term survival of this population 
(Araújo-Andrade et al., 2020) [1].

Effects of rehabilitation training on an elderly population with mild to 
moderate hearing loss: study protocol for a randomised clinical trial.

Background: Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a form of hearing loss in 
over 60-years-olds and has a negative impact on quality of life. Presbycusis is 
multifactorial and is predominately characterised with a loss of speech 
perception in noise. In the cochlea, auditory filters decompose broadband sound 
into a series of narrowband output signals, which contains two kinds of temporal 
information: slow changes in overall amplitude envelope (ENV) and faster 
variations in temporal fine structure (TFS). TFS is important for recognition of 
target speech in noise. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of 
TFS rehabilitation training in participants over the age of 60 years with mild 
to moderate hearing loss. Methods: A randomised clinical trial  conducted on 30 
participants with mild (loss of 20-39dB HL) to moderate (40-69dB HL) hearing 
loss, aged between 60 and 75 years old. Participants with conductive hearing 
loss, abnormal middle ear pathology and central nervous system disease were 
excluded. Participants were selected randomly  to an intervention and control 
group with a 1:1 ratio. Rehabilitation for the intervention Group are 30-minute 
sessions three times a week for a total five weeks of vowel consonant vowel 
words that are used to eliminate ENV and keep only TFS. Word in noise test, 
binaural TFS test, and Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale scores are 
performed at the beginning and end of study to evaluate the effect of 
rehabilitation training. Conclusion:  Life expectancy in the elderly has 
improved, leading to an increased prevalence of age-related diseases including 
presbycusis. A literature review highlighted that TFS damage is permanent; 
however, in this study we will attempt to prove that TFS training may lead to 
speech in noise perception improvement. Trial registration: Registry of Clinical 
Trials, IRCT2019625044006N1 (7 th August 2019).

The use of antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV (PWH) has improved life 
expectancy. However, PWH now lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV 
infection. Unfortunately, PWH smoke at higher rates and have more difficulty 
maintaining abstinence than the general population, compounding their risk for 
chronic disease. In this Commentary, we describe a United States National Cancer 
Institute-led initiative to address the relative lack of research focused on 
developing, testing, and implementing smoking cessation interventions for PWH. 
This initiative supports seven clinical trials designed to systematically test 
and/or develop and test adaptations of evidence-based smoking cessation 
interventions for PWH (eg, combination of behavioral and pharmacological). We 
summarize each project, including setting/recruitment sites, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, interventions being tested, and outcomes. This initiative provides 
critical opportunities for collaboration and data harmonization across projects. 
The knowledge gained will inform strategies to assist PWH to promote and 
maintain abstinence, and ensure that these efforts are adaptable and scalable, 
thereby addressing one of the major threats to the health of PWH. Reducing 
smoking behavior may be particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic 
given that smokers who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be at risk for more 
severe disease.
IMPLICATIONS: This Commentary describes a National Cancer Institute-led 
initiative to advance the science and practice of treating tobacco use among 
PWH, which is now responsible for more life years lost than HIV. We describe the 
scope of the problem, the objectives of the initiative, and a summary of the 
seven funded studies. Harmonization of data across projects will provide
