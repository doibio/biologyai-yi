drops and they participated in the study for 2 years. We found that quality of 
life was similar regardless of treatment. Those starting with surgery had lower 
pressure and needed far fewer types of eye drops than those starting with eye 
drops. Thirty-nine patients in the eye drop arm required surgery to control 
their glaucoma. Initial treatment with eye drops was cheaper over 2 years’ 
follow-up. Our study suggests that, over a 2-year period, having surgery in the 
first instance lowers intraocular pressure more than eye drops and is equally as 
safe as eye drops. Although eye drops are a cheaper treatment option for the 
NHS, if the effects of surgery on intraocular pressure are lasting, then the 
increased cost may be justified.

IMPORTANCE: Cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) has been found to be a safe and 
beneficial alternative to traditional center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) 
and might be associated with higher participation rates by reducing barriers to 
CR use. However, implementation of CTR interventions remains low, which may be 
owing to a lack of cost-effectiveness analyses of data from large-scale 
randomized clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CTR with relapse prevention 
compared with center-based CR among patients with coronary artery disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation performed a 
cost-utility analysis of data from the SmartCare-CAD (Effects of Cardiac 
Telerehabilitation in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Using a Personalized 
Patient-Centred ICT Platform) randomized clinical trial. The cost-effectiveness 
and utility of 3 months of cardiac telerehabilitation followed by 9 months of 
relapse prevention were compared with the cost-effectiveness of traditional 
center-based cardiac rehabilitation. The analysis included 300 patients with 
stable coronary artery disease who received care at a CR center serving 2 
general hospitals in the Netherlands between May 23, 2016, and July 26, 2018. 
All patients were entering phase 2 of outpatient CR and were followed up for 1 
year (until August 14, 2019). Data were analyzed from September 21, 2020, to 
September 24, 2021.
INTERVENTION: After baseline measurements were obtained, participants were 
randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive CTR (intervention group) or 
center-based CR (control group) using computerized block randomization. After 6 
supervised center-based training sessions, patients in the intervention group 
continued training at home using a heart rate monitor and accelerometer. 
Patients uploaded heart rate and physical activity data and discussed their 
progress during a weekly video consultation with their physical therapist. After 
3 months, weekly coaching was concluded, and on-demand coaching was initiated 
for relapse prevention; patients were instructed to continue using their 
wearable sensors and were contacted in cases of nonadherence to the intervention 
or reduced exercise or physical activity volumes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years were assessed using the 
EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level survey (EQ-5D-5L) and the EuroQol Visual Analogue 
Scale (EQ-VAS), and cardiac-associated health care costs and non-health care 
costs were measured by health care consumption, productivity, and informal care 
questionnaires (the Medical Consumption Questionnaire, the Productivity Cost 
Questionnaire, and the Valuation of Informal Care Questionnaire) designed by the 
Institute for Medical Technology Assessment. Costs were converted to 2020 price 
levels (in euros) using the Dutch consumer price index (to convert to US 
dollars, euro values were multiplied by 1.142, which was the mean exchange rate 
in 2020).
RESULTS: Among 300 patients (266 men [88.7%]), the mean (SD) age was 60.7 (9.5) 
years. The quality of life among patients receiving CTR vs center-based CR was 
comparable during the study according to the results of both utility measures 
(mean difference on EQ-5D-5L: -0.004; P = .82; mean difference on EQ-VAS: 
-0.001; P = .92). Intervention costs were significantly higher for CTR (mean 
[SE], €224 [€4] [$256 ($4)]) compared with center-based CR (mean [SE], €156 [€5] 
[$178 ($6)]; P < .001); however, no difference in overall cardiac health care 
costs was observed between CTR (mean [SE], €4787 [€503] [$5467 ($574)] and 
center-based CR (mean [SE], €5507 [€659] [$6289 ($753)]; P = .36). From a 
societal perspective, CTR was associated with lower costs compared with 
center-based CR (mean [SE], €20 495 [€ 2751] [$23 405 ($3142)] vs €24 381 
[€3613] [$27 843 ($4126)], respectively), although this difference was not 
statistically significant (-€3887 [-$4439]; P = .34).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation, a CTR intervention with 
relapse prevention was likely to be cost-effective compared with center-based 
CR, suggesting that CTR maybe used as an alternative intervention for the 
treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. These results add to the 
evidence base in favor of CTR and may increase the implementation of CTR 
interventions in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: In 2015, the Swedish government in an unprecedented move decided to 
allocate 150 million € to provide funding for new drugs for hepatitis C. This 
was triggered by the introduction of the first second generation of 
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) promising higher cure rates and reduced side 
effects. The drugs were cost-effective but had a prohibitive budget impact. 
Subsequently, additional products have entered the market leading to reduction 
in prices and expansions of the eligible patient base.
METHODS: We estimated the social surplus generated by the new DAAs in Stockholm, 
Sweden, for the years 2014-2019. The actual use and cost of the drugs was based 
on registry data. Effects on future health care costs, indirect costs and QALY 
gains were estimated using a Markov model based primarily on Swedish data and 
using previous generations of interferon-based therapies as the counterfactual.
RESULTS: A considerable social surplus was generated, 15% of which was 
appropriated by the producers whose share fell rapidly over time as prices fell. 
Most of the consumer surplus was generated by QALY gains, although 10% was from 
reduced indirect costs. QALY gains increased less rapidly than the number of 
treated patients as the eligibility criteria was loosened.
CONCLUSIONS: The transfer of funds from the government to the regions helped 
generate substantial surplus for both consumers and producers with indirect 
costs playing an important role. The funding model may serve as a model for the 
financing of innovative treatments in the future.

Resistance management is very important for devising control strategies of 
polyphagous insect-pests like Helicoverpa armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: 
Noctuidae). Considering the importance of resistance management, demographic 
features of selected and unselected populations of H. armigera were studied in 6 
different treatments viz. emamectin benzoate, Helicoverpa armigera 
Nucleopolyhedrosis Virus (HaNPV), emamectin benzoate+HaNPV, spinetoram, 
spinetoram+HaNPV and control. Higher values for fecundity, intrinsic rate, the 
finite rate of increase (λ) were recorded in the control of selected as compared 
to the rest of treatment. Similarly, higher values for these population 
parameters viz. oviposition days, fecundity, intrinsic rate, the finite rate of 
increase were calculated in the unselected control. Similarly, net reproductive 
rate (R0) for selected and unselected control was higher as compared to the rest 
of the treatments. It may happen because these kinds of selection pressures can 
result in decreased fitness of the test insect thus decreased fitness of H. 
armigera in different treatments was observed as compared to the control. 
Additionally, quicker development of susceptible insects was observed because 
susceptible insects were growing without any stressor (xenobiotics) as compared 
to the rest which contributed to their faster development.

Gender gap in life expectancy in India and role of age groups: A comparison 
between before and after male - female life expectancy at birth crossover.

To assess the gender gap in life expectancy at birth in India and its major 
states as well as the timing of male-female life expectancy at birth crossover. 
To analyze the age-specific contributions to the changing gender differences 
before and after the crossover at the national and sub-national levels. We have 
used sample-survey-based age-specific mortality data available for the periods 
1970-2018 to construct abridged life tables. The contribution of different age 
groups to the gender gap is estimated by using Arriaga's method of 
decomposition. During 1981-85 female life expectancy at birth caught up with 
male life expectancy at birth for India and by 2005 all major states completed 
the crossover. The male-female crossover in life expectancy at the national 
level in the early 80s is remarkable in the face of continued female 
disadvantage from birth till adolescence, even for some richer states. We 
provide evidence that gender difference in longevity in favour of females is 
largely a function of adult age groups and younger age groups contribute 
negatively to the gender gap in life expectancy at birth in most states. 
Juxtaposing the results from contribution in an absolute number of years and 
their relative contribution change before and after the crossover, it is 
established that although the adult and old age groups contribute the highest in 
the absolute number of years before and after the crossover, the contribution of 
the reproductive age groups and childhood years in the recent time is most 
relevant in relative terms.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the quality of life and cost 
effectiveness between endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical 
repair (OSR) in young patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
DESIGN: This was a single-center, observational, and retrospective study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with 
AAA, who were <70 years old and underwent EVAR or OSR between January 2012 and 
October 2016. Only patients with aortic morphology that was suitable for EVAR 
were enrolled. Data on the complication rates, medical expenses, and expected 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected, and the cost per QALY at 
three years was compared.
RESULTS: Among 90 patients with aortic morphology who were eligible for EVAR, 37 
and 53 patients underwent EVAR and OSR, respectively. No significant differences 
were observed in perioperative cardiovascular events and death between the two 
groups. However, during the follow-up period, patients undergoing OSR showed a 
significantly lower complication rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.11; P = .021). From 
the three-year cost-effectiveness analysis, the total sum of costs was 
significantly lower in the OSR group (P < .001) than that in the EVAR group, and 
the number of QALYs was superior in the OSR group (P = .013). The cost per QALY 
at three years was significantly lower in the OSR group than that in the EVAR 
group (mean: $4038 vs. $10 137; respectively; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: OSR had lower complication rates and better cost-effectiveness than 
EVAR Among young patients with feasible aortic anatomy.

The objective of this paper is to model lost Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) 
from symptoms arising from COVID-19 disease in the UK population, including 
symptoms of 'long-COVID'. The scope includes QALYs lost to symptoms, but not 
deaths, due to acute COVID-19 and long-COVID. The prevalence of symptomatic 
COVID-19, encompassing acute symptoms and long-COVID symptoms, was modelled 
using a decay function. Permanent injury as a result of COVID-19 infection, was 
modelled as a fixed prevalence. Both parts were combined to calculate QALY loss 
due to COVID-19 symptoms. Assuming a 60% final attack rate for SARS-CoV-2 
infection in the population, we modelled 299,730 QALYs lost within 1 year of 
infection (90% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 10% permanent injury) and 557,764 
QALYs lost within 10 years of infection (49% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 51% 
due to permanent injury). The UK Government willingness-to-pay to avoid these 
QALY losses would be £17.9 billion and £32.2 billion, respectively. 
Additionally, 90,143 people were subject to permanent injury from COVID-19 
(0.14% of the population). Given the ongoing development in information in this 
area, we present a model framework for calculating the health economic impacts 
of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model framework can aid in 
quantifying the adverse health impact of COVID-19, long-COVID and permanent 
injury following COVID-19 in society and assist the proactive management of risk 
posed to health. Further research is needed using standardised measures of 
patient reported outcomes relevant to long-COVID and applied at a population 
level.

In aging societies, the morbidity and mortality of dementia is increasing at a 
significant rate, thereby imposing burden on healthcare, economy and the society 
as well. Patients' and caregivers' quality of life and life expectancy are 
greatly determined by the early diagnosis and the initiation of available 
symptomatic treatments. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have been the 
cornerstones of Alzheimer's therapy for approximately two decades and over the 
years, more and more experience has been gained on their use in non-Alzheimer's 
dementias too. The aim of our work was to provide a comprehensive summary about 
the use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimers's dementias.

Maintaining metabolic homeostasis is essential for cellular and organismal 
health throughout life. Multiple signaling pathways that regulate metabolism 
also play critical roles in aging, such as PI3K/AKT, mTOR, AMPK, and sirtuins 
(SIRTs). Among them, sirtuins are known as a protein family with versatile 
functions, such as metabolic control, epigenetic modification and lifespan 
extension. Therefore, by understanding how sirtuins regulate metabolic 
processes, we can start to understand how they slow down or accelerate 
biological aging from the perspectives of metabolic regulation. Here, we review 
the biology of SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, known as the mitochondrial sirtuins due 
to their localization in the mitochondrial matrix. First, we will discuss 
canonical pathways that regulate metabolism more broadly and how these are 
integrated with aging regulation. Then, we will summarize the current knowledge 
about functional differences between SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 in metabolic 
control and integration in signaling networks. Finally, we will discuss how 
mitochondrial sirtuins regulate processes associated with aging and 
aging-related diseases.

Background: Data for the global burden of laryngeal cancer (LC) are limited. 
Methods: We reported the incidence of, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
and deaths due to LC by age, sex and by social-demographic index (SDI) in all 
countries and territories during 2007 to 2017, based on data from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. We also assessed the risk factors for 
LC-associated DALYs and deaths through a comparative risk assessment framework. 
Results: Globally, from 2007 to 2017, the age-standardized incidence rate 
increased by 0.95%, the age-standardized DALY rate decreased by 8.75%, and the 
age-standardized death rate decreased by 7.66%. The age-standardized incidence, 
DALY, and death rates in 2017 were all the highest in the low SDI quintile. The 
middle SDI quintile witnessed the highest percentage changes in age-standardized 
incidence, DALY, and death rates during 2007-2017. At the GBD regional level, 
the highest age-standardized incidence, DALY, and death rates in 2017 occurred 
in the Caribbean, followed by South Asia. East Asia showed the largest increases 
in age-standardized incidence, DALY, and death rates from 2007 to 2017. At the 
national level, China and Jamaica reported the largest percentage increases in 
the age-standardized incidence, DALY, and death rates over the study period. 
Conclusion: The global age-standardized incidence of LC remain stable. However, 
the age-standardized DALY and death rates decreased significantly over the study 
period. Impact: Our findings will be beneficial for developing policies to 
reduce the disease burden of LC in particular regions or countries.

INTRODUCTION: Dry needling (DN) has been shown to be effective for the treatment 
of upper extremity hypertonia in patients with stroke.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DN in patients with stroke.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed in a research study 
conducted at a Spanish public hospital where patients were classified into two 
groups with or without DN. Hypertonia was measured using the Modified Modified 
Ashworth Scale (MMAS), and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the EuroQoL 
5-dimension questionnaire. Data regarding the effects and costs of physiotherapy 
were presented by calculating the mean and 95% confidence interval. The health 
outcomes were evaluated considering the rate of responders to the treatment 
based on the MMAS. Spanish preference weights were used to estimate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were calculated to determine 
the economic value of DN.
RESULTS: Eighty patients with stroke in the subacute stage of recovery were 
selected to participate in this study. Based on the rate of responders, the ICER 
of the DN group was very low. Despite the sensitivity analysis performed, the 
results of the ICUR were not encouraging.
DISCUSSION: Cost-effectiveness with responder rate results were favourable for 
the DN group and were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis according to levels 
of care. In addition, our findings revealed that 4 weeks of treatment could be 
more cost-effective than 8 weeks. DN treatment of the upper extremity appears to 
be cost-effective based on the rate of responders measured using the MMAS scale.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) experience a great symptom burden. Breathlessness is a very frequently 
reported symptom that negatively affects all aspects of daily life and could 
lead to fear of dying. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) could be an important 
palliative measure to manage breathlessness in patients with advanced COPD. We 
decided to conduct a scoping review to attain an overview of the existing 
research and to identify knowledge gaps. This scoping review aims to 
systematically map published studies on the use of NIV in the palliative care of 
COPD patients, including the perspectives and experiences of patients, families 
and healthcare professionals.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will employ the framework of Arksey 
and O'Malley. The reporting will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A 
comprehensive and systematic search strategy will be developed in cooperation 
with an experienced librarian. Database searches will be conducted in AMED, 
PEDro, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and MEDLINE in February 2021. Pairs of authors 
will independently assess studies' eligibility and extract data using a 
standardised data-charting form. The data will be inductively summarised and 
organised thematically. The results will be discussed with an advisory board 
consisting of nurses and physicians from respiratory and intensive care units.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for the workshop with the advisory board has 
been attained from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (480222), and approval 
will be attained from the Personal Data Protection Officers of the participating 
hospitals. All advisory board participants will sign an informed written consent 
before participation. The results could contribute to developing the body of 
evidence on the use of NIV in the palliative care of COPD patients and serve to 
identify directions for future research.

INTRODUCTION: ACOSOG-Z0011(Z11) trial showed that axillary node clearance (ANC) 
may be omitted in women with ≤2 positive nodes undergoing breast conserving 
surgery (BCS) and whole breast radiotherapy (RT). A confirmatory study is needed 
to clarify the role of axillary treatment in women with ≤2 macrometastases 
undergoing BCS and groups that were not included in Z11 for example, mastectomy 
and those with microscopic extranodal invasion. The primary objective of 
POsitive Sentinel NOde: adjuvant therapy alone versus adjuvant therapy plus 
Clearance or axillary radiotherapy (POSNOC) is to evaluate whether for women 
with breast cancer and 1 or 2 macrometastases, adjuvant therapy alone is 
non-inferior to adjuvant therapy plus axillary treatment, in terms of 5-year 
axillary recurrence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: POSNOC is a pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority, 
international trial with participants randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Women are 
eligible if they have T1/T2, unifocal or multifocal invasive breast cancer, and 
1 or 2 macrometastases at sentinel node biopsy, with or without extranodal 
extension. In the intervention group women receive adjuvant therapy alone, in 
the standard care group they receive ANC or axillary RT. In both groups women 
receive adjuvant therapy, according to local guidelines. This includes systemic 
therapy and, if indicated, RT to breast or chest wall. The UK Radiotherapy 
Trials Quality Assurance Group manages the in-built radiotherapy quality 
assurance programme. Primary endpoint is 5-year axillary recurrence. Secondary 
outcomes are arm morbidity assessed by Lymphoedema and Breast Cancer 
Questionnaire and QuickDASH questionnaires; quality of life and anxiety as 
assessed with FACT B+4 and State/Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, 
respectively; other oncological outcomes; economic evaluation using EQ-5D-5L. 
Target sample size is 1900. Primary analysis is per protocol. Recruitment 
started on 1 August 2014 and as of 9 June 2021, 1866 participants have been 
randomised.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics 
Service Committee East Midlands-Nottingham 2 (REC reference: 13/EM/0459). 
Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Though Switzerland has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, this 
global indicator may mask significant disparities at a local level. The present 
study used a spatial cluster detection approach based on individual death 
records to investigate the geographical footprint of life expectancy 
inequalities in the state of Geneva, Switzerland. Individual-level mortality 
data (n = 22,751) were obtained from Geneva's official death notices 
(2009-2016). We measured life expectancy inequalities using the years of 
potential life lost or gained (YPLLG) metric, defined as the difference between 
an individual's age at death and their life expectancy at birth. We assessed the 
spatial dependence of YPLLG across the state of Geneva using spatial 
autocorrelation statistics (Local Moran's I). To ensure the robustness of the 
patterns discovered, we ran the analyses for ten random subsets of 10,000 
individuals taken from the 22,751 deceased. We also repeated the spatial 
analysis for YPLLG before and after controlling for individual-level and 
neighborhood-level covariates. The results showed that YPLLG was not randomly 
distributed across the state of Geneva. The ten random subsets revealed no 
significant difference with the geographic footprint of YPLLG and the population 
characteristics within Local Moran cluster types, suggesting robustness for the 
observed spatial structure. The proportion of women, the proportion of Swiss, 
the neighborhood median income, and the neighborhood median age were all 
significantly lower for populations in low YPLLG clusters when compared to 
populations in high YPLLG clusters. After controlling for individual-level and 
neighborhood-level covariates, we observed a reduction of 43% and 39% in the 
size of low and high YPLLG clusters, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study in Switzerland using spatial cluster detection methods to 
investigate inequalities in life expectancy at a local scale and based on 
individual data. We identified clear geographic footprints of YPLLG, which may 
support further investigations and guide future public health interventions at 
the local level.

Cellular senescence is an intricate and multifactorial phenomenon, which is 
characterized by an irreversible cellular growth arrest, it is caused in 
response to irretrievably DNA damage, telomere shorting, activation of oncogene, 
and oxidative stress. Human diploid fibroblasts are a well-established 
experimental model for premature senescence-related studies, and exposure of 
fibroblasts to H2O2 is widely used as a SIPS model. Recently, it has been 
reported many studies of CoQ10 as to anti-aging effects, however the effect of 
CoQ10 on H2O2-induced SIPS model of human skin fibroblasts has not been 
understood. So that, we investigated that human skin fibroblasts were used to 
investigate the prevention effect of CoQ10 against H2O2-induced SIPS model. We 
created SIPS model fibroblasts with treatment of 100 μM H2O2 for 2 h. In this 
study, CoQ10 also increased cell viability and mRNA levels of type I, IV 
collagen and protein level of type I collagen. Moreover, it is shown that CoQ10 
suppressed oxidative stress, degradation of collagen by increasing MMP 
expression, and decreasing senescence-associated phenotypes (e.g. SA-βgal 
positive staining and SASP) for preventing skin aging via H2O2-induced SIPS 
model. These results suggested that CoQ10 has possibility to be contributory for 
extension of healthy life expectancy in Japan.

Due to increasing life expectancy, low-cost interventions to counteract 
age-related memory impairment have gained popularity. Physical activity has been 
shown to positively affect memory and hippocampal plasticity in rodents and 
humans. These effects have been proposed to be mediated by the release of 
neurotrophic factors. However, studies examining the effects of a single 
cardiovascular exercise session on human memory have yielded conflicting 
results. Moreover, it remains unclear whether exercise-induced memory 
enhancements are related to changes in peripheral neurotrophic factor 
concentrations. The present study tested whether one bout of cardiovascular 
exercise during an early phase of memory consolidation, compared to one bout of 
stretching and toning, positively affected memory. Furthermore, it was analyzed 
whether exercise-induced changes in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were related to memory enhancement 
after a single bout of physical exercise. Fifty healthy participants (20-40 
years) were randomly assigned to either a cycling group (BIKE) or a stretching 
and toning group (STRETCH). Participants performed an implicit vocabulary 
learning task which was immediately followed by physical exercise. Memory for 
the learned vocabulary was tested 1-2 weeks later. To measure exercise-induced 
changes in serum neurotrophic factor levels, blood samples were collected at 
rest (baseline) and immediately after the exercise session. Results did not show 
a significant difference in memory between the BIKE group and the STRETCH group. 
However, in the BIKE group, a larger increase in BDNF and VEGF levels was 
observed than in the STRETCH group. Moreover, the increase in BDNF and memory 
performance tended to be positively related in the BIKE group. We speculate that 
the correlation between exercise-increased BDNF levels and memory in the cycling 
group may indicate an involvement of BDNF in mediating memory processes after 
acute cardiovascular exercise.

BACKGROUND: With the roll-out of antiretroviral treatment (ART), the life 
expectancy of people with HIV and, hence, morbidity from non-communicable 
diseases, including pulmonary diseases, have increased.
OBJECTIVES: This research study aims to investigate whether HIV infection and 
ART use are associated with pulmonary function, given the high frequency of 
pulmonary infections, including tuberculosis (TB), associated with HIV.
METHOD: Adults living with HIV (ART-naïve, on first- or second-line ART), and 
age and sex matched HIV-negative controls were included in a cross-sectional 
study in Johannesburg, South Africa. Spirometry was performed to determine lung 
function, measuring the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the 
forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV1/FVC ratio before (pre), and after 
(post), short-acting bronchodilator. The association of HIV infection and ART 
use with pulmonary function was analysed using linear regression models, 
adjusting for age, gender, body surface area (BSA), employment, education, 
smoking and TB.
RESULTS: Overall, 548 participants (62% women) were included with a mean age of 
38 (standard deviation [s.d.] 9.5) years. No effect of HIV or ART on post-FEV1 
was observed in adjusted analysis. Additional adjustment for TB resulted in a 
higher post-FEV1 in participants on ART compared with HIV-negative participants, 
whereas TB was associated with a lower FEV1. No effect of HIV and ART on 
post-FEV1/FVC was observed.
CONCLUSION: HIV infection and ART use were not associated with reduced pulmonary 
function in this urban African population. Tuberculosis showed a mediating 
effect on the association between HIV, ART and pulmonary function.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is an extremely aggressive 
malignancy. Extension to the orbit and adjacent structures is common, but 
isolated visual loss as a presenting symptom is rare. We report a rare case of 
SNUC with bilateral visual loss as the initial manifestation. A 34-year-old 
gentleman was presented with acute onset loss of vision in both eyes for one 
week. It was followed by recurrent headaches and epistaxis. Visual acuity in the 
right eye was 2/60 and 3/60 in the left eye. Funduscopy showed a bilateral 
swollen disc. Neuroimaging revealed a large mass in the ethmoidal sinus extended 
laterally causing compression to recti muscles and the optic nerves. The 
histopathological examination of nasal tissue biopsy showed features of SNUC 
with bone and perineural invasion. A diagnosis of SNUC with bilateral 
compressive optic neuropathy was established. The patient underwent tumor 
debulking and base of skull reconstruction by the neurosurgical team. This was 
then followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient's right eye visual 
acuity initially improved to 6/9. However, his both eye vision developed into no 
light perception during treatment. In conclusion, SNUC is a highly aggressive 
tumor that may present with acute blindness. Early treatment may save a life, 
but the visual prognosis is guarded due to extensive optic nerve damage caused 
by tumor compression.

Introduction: Neighborhood environment factors are relevant for dietary 
behaviors, but associations between home neighborhood context and disease 
prevention behaviors vary depending on the definition of neighborhood. The 
present study uses a publicly available dataset to examine whether associations 
between neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and fruit/vegetable (FV) 
consumption vary when NSES is defined by different neighborhood sizes and 
shapes. Methods: We analyzed data from 1,736 adults with data in GeoFLASHE, a 
geospatial extension of the National Cancer Institute's Family Life, Activity, 
Sun, Health, and Eating Study (FLASHE). We examined correlations of NSES values 
across neighborhood buffer shapes (circular or street network) and sizes 
(ranging from 400 to 1,200 m) and ran weighted simple and multivariable 
regressions modeling frequency of FV consumption by NSES for each neighborhood 
definition. Regressions were also stratified by gender. Results: NSES measures 
were highly correlated across various neighborhood buffer definitions. In models 
adjusted for socio-demographics, circular buffers of all sizes and street 
buffers 750 m and larger were significantly associated with FV consumption 
frequency for women only. Conclusion: NSES may be particularly relevant for 
women's FV consumption, and further research can examine whether these
