hepatitis A mortality rate of all EAGLE countries from the years 1995 to 2010. 
Additionally, hepatitis A mortality rate was regressed on year.
FINDINGS: Regression results show a constant decline of mortality as HDI 
increased. For each increase of one in HDI value in this hypothetical country, 
mortality rate declined by 2.3016 deaths per 100,000 people. The hypothetical 
country showed the HDI value increasing by 0.0073 each year. Also, results 
displayed a decrease in hepatitis A mortality rate of 0.0168 per 100,000 people 
per year. Finally, the mortality rate for hepatitis A in this hypothetical 
country is projected to be down to 0.11299 deaths per 100,000 people by 2030 and 
its economic status will fall just below the HDI criteria for a developed 
country by 2025.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The hypothetical country as a prototype model was created 
from the results of regressed data from EAGLE countries. It is aimed to display 
an example of the health and economic changes occurring in these rapidly 
developing regions in order to help understand potential hepatitis A trends, 
while underscoring the importance of informed and regular policy updates in the 
coming years. The author believes this regression provides insight into the 
patterns of hepatitis A mortality and HDI as these EAGLE countries undergo rapid 
development.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypic autoimmune disease 
manifesting as chronic inflammation of the synovium and leading to acceleration 
of cardiovascular disease and shortening of life expectancy. The basic defect 
causing autoimmunity has remained elusive, but recent insights have challenged 
the notion that autoantigen is the core driver.
RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging data have added metabolic cues involved in the proper 
maintenance and activation of immune cells as pathogenic regulators. 
Specifically, studies have unveiled metabolic pathways that enforce T cell fate 
decisions promoting tissue inflammation; including T cell tissue invasiveness, T 
cell cytokine release, T cell-dependent macrophage activation and inflammatory T 
cell death. At the center of the metabolic abnormalities lies the mitochondria, 
which is consistently underperforming in RA T cells. The mitochondrial defect 
results at least partially from insufficient DNA repair and leads to lipid 
droplet accumulation, formation of invasive membrane ruffles, inflammasome 
activation and pyroptotic T cell death.
SUMMARY: T cells in patients with RA, even naïve T cells never having been 
involved in inflammatory lesions, have a unique metabolic signature and the 
changes in intracellular metabolites drive pathogenic T cell behavior. 
Recognizing the role of metabolic signals in cell fate decisions opens the 
possibility for immunomodulation long before the end stage synovial inflammation 
encountered in clinical practice.

AIM: The objective was to study the long-term (lifetime) cost effectiveness of 
four different hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment models of care (MOC) with 
directly acting antiviral drugs.
METHODS: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA) was undertaken extrapolating to up to 30 years from cost and outcome data 
collected from a primary study involving a real-life Australian cohort. In this 
study, noncirrhotic patients treated for HCV from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 
2017 at four major public hospitals and liaising sites in South Australia were 
studied retrospectively. The MOC were classified depending on the person 
providing patient workup, treatment and monitoring into MOC1 (specialist), MOC2 
(mixed specialist and hepatitis nurse), MOC3 (hepatitis nurse) and MOC4 (general 
practitioner, GP). Incremental costs were estimated from the Medicare 
perspective. Incremental outcomes were estimated based on the quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) gained by achieving a sustained virological response. A 
cost-effectiveness threshold of Australian dollar 50 000 per QALY gained, the 
implicit criterion used for assessing the cost-effectiveness of new 
pharmaceuticals and medical services in Australia was assumed. Net monetary 
benefit (NMB) estimates based on this threshold were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 1373 patients, 64% males, mean age 50 (SD ±11) years, were 
studied. In the CEA, MOC4 and MOC2 clearly dominated MOC1 over 30 years with 
lower costs and higher QALYs. Similarly, NMB was the highest in MOC4, followed 
by MOC2.
CONCLUSION: Decentralized care using GP and mixed consultant nurse models were 
cost-effective ways of promoting HCV treatment uptake in the setting of 
unrestricted access to new antivirals.

The inability to develop multiscale models which can describe vector-borne 
disease systems in terms of the complete pathogen life cycle which represents 
multiple targets for control has hindered progress in our efforts to control, 
eliminate and even eradicate these multi-host infections. This is because it is 
currently not easy to determine precisely where and how in the life cycles of 
vector-borne disease systems the key constrains which are regarded as crucial in 
regulating pathogen population dynamics in both the vertebrate host and vector 
host operate. In this article, we present a general method for development of 
multiscale models of vector-borne disease systems which integrate the 
within-host and between-host scales for the two hosts (a vertebrate host and a 
vector host) that are implicated in vector-borne disease dynamics. The general 
multiscale modelling method is an extension of our previous work on multiscale 
models of infectious disease systems which established a basic science and 
accompanying theory of how pathogen population dynamics at within-host scale 
scales up to between-host scale and in turn how it scales down from between-host 
scale to within-host scale. Further, the general method is applied to multiscale 
modelling of human onchocerciasis-a vector-borne disease system which is 
sometimes called river blindness as a case study.

PURPOSE: Hydranencephaly is a rare condition that occurs during embryogenesis 
after neurogenesis and is characterized by the near complete absence of the 
cerebral hemispheres. In general, patients with hydranencephaly have been 
considered to have a markedly reduced life expectancy. We present 4 patients 
with hydranencephaly who have survived for over 5 years. The management and 
problems encountered in these cases are discussed.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted at our institution. Medical charts 
and radiographic studies were reviewed. Data including age at follow-up, sex, 
clinical complications, and surgical procedures were recorded.
RESULTS: Six patients were radiologically diagnosed with hydranencephaly during 
the period from January 2000 to December 2012. Two patients were excluded from 
our study: one because of death from pneumonia at 1 year of age and another 
because of transfer to another hospital. Four patients (3 males and 1 female) 
were included in the analysis. All 4 patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal 
shunt (VPS) placement and shunt revision. VPS infection occurred in 3 of 4 
cases, and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was observed in 2 of 4 cases. One 
patient underwent successful choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) and shunt 
removal after shunt infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged survival with hydranencephaly is not unusual in the 
modern treatment era. CSF shunt problems, such as recurring shunt malfunction 
and shunt infection, represent one of the major problems, and avoiding CSF shunt 
with CPC is particularly desirable in patients with hydranencephaly.

Patients with hip fractures experience reduced health-related quality of life 
and have a reduced life expectancy. Patients' utilization of healthcare leads to 
costs to society. The results of the study can be used in future economic 
evaluations of treatments for hip fractures.
PURPOSE: Hip fractures are associated with high mortality, reduced quality of 
life, and increased healthcare utilization, leading to an economic burden to 
society. The purpose of this study is to determine the burden of illness of hip 
fractures in elderly Dutch patients for specific time periods after surgery.
METHODS: Patients with a hip fracture above the age of 65 were included in the 
study. In the 1-year period after surgery, patients were asked to complete a set 
of questionnaires pre-injury (retrospectively), and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 
6 months and 12 months after surgery. The set of questionnaires included the 
Euroqol 5D (EQ-5D-3L), the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ) and 
iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ). Health-related quality of life was 
calculated using Dutch tariffs. Costs were calculated using the methodology 
described in the Dutch costing manual.
RESULTS: Approximately 20% of patients with a hip fracture died within 1 year. 
Health-related quality of life was significantly reduced compared to pre-injury 
values, and patients did not recover to their pre-injury values within 1 year. 
Total costs in the first year after injury were €27,573, of which 10% were due 
to costs of the procedure (€2706). Total follow-up costs (€24,876) were 
predominantly consisting of healthcare costs. Monthly costs decreased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Hip fractures lead to a burden to patients, resulting from 
mortality and health-related quality of life reductions, and to society, due to 
(healthcare) costs. The results of this study can be used in future economic 
evaluations.

Physical activity levels decline during adolescence; however, some individuals 
initiate or maintain physical activity participation during this period of life. 
Socialisation impacts physical activity participation, yet few studies have 
explored the role of parental and peer processes concurrently on youth physical 
activity transitions over time. This study examined whether mother's father's 
and friends' support, modelling and teasing predicted adolescents' physical 
activity initiation, drop-off or maintenance over twelve months. In total, 803 
adolescents (62.5% females, M age = 13.72) from Dublin, Ireland, completed 
self-report measures of support, modelling, teasing, and physical activity. 
Participants were classified as physical activity maintainers (17.8%), low 
active maintainers (58.8%), drop-offs (10.3%) or physical activity initiators 
(13.1%). The results revealed that parental support and modelling were unrelated 
to adolescents' physical activity transitions, however mother's and father's 
support predicted sustained physical activity participation twelve months later. 
In contrast, peer processes predicted physical activity maintenance, initiation 
and drop-off at one-year follow-up underscoring the salient role of peers for 
adolescents' behaviour change. In line with expectancy-value theory, the 
findings indicate that parents and peers represent distinct socialising agents 
that impart their influence on adolescents' physical activity maintenance and 
behaviour change through various mechanisms, highlighting the need to consider 
both sources of socialisation concurrently in future studies of adolescent 
behaviour change.

BACKGROUND: With life expectancy on the rise and the baby boomer generation 
growing older, Alzheimer's disease (AD) will affect more individuals and 
families than ever before. Therefore, it is imperative that healthcare providers 
identify the objective and perceived factors which positively and negatively 
affect the experience of progressing through AD.
AIM: The goal of this exploratory qualitative research is to begin to develop an 
in-depth description of the perceptions related to life satisfaction in early-to 
mid-AD from the patient and caregiver perspectives.
METHODS: A convenience sample of four community-dwelling AD patients and 
caregivers were recruited from a local Alzheimer's Association support group. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted together with participants and 
caregivers.
RESULTS: The major findings of this study uncovered a process by which 1) 
changes in activity occur in response to the diagnosis 2) dyads discover new 
ways in which to mutually adapt and cope and 3) the person with dementia remains 
meaningfully engaged in their lives with a generally positive perception of 
quality of life (QoL).
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings are a promising line of research and 
have implications for Alzheimer's patients, their families, and person-centered 
care. By accounting for individual levels of baseline engagement and taking each 
patient's perspective into account, nurses have the ability to identify 
individual changes over time and positively impact the patient's QoL. Further 
studies with larger and more diverse samples are needed to expand upon this 
preliminary framework.

INTRODUCTION: Human papilloma virus is an etiological risk factor for a subset 
of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. HPV has been proven to be a powerful 
prognostic biomarker for oropharyngeal cancer, but its role in the larynx has 
not been explored in depth. The developmental mechanisms of laryngeal carcinomas 
are quite complex and controlled by various factors. Smoking and alcohol are 
most important risk factors. Recent studies indicate that HPV infection also 
plays an important role in larynx carcinomas. HPV related laryngeal carcinomas 
especially occur at the supraglottic region of larynx.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the frequency of HPV/protein16 positivity in 
patients with laryngeal carcinoma and association of HPV and/or p16 positivity 
with variables such as age, sex, smoking habits, tumor localization, lymph node 
metastasis, recurrence and survival in advanced stage laryngeal carcinoma in our 
study.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 90 patients with advanced laryngeal 
carcinoma. The Control group was 10 normal larynx mucosa specimens. The presence 
of HPV was investigated polyclonally by polymerase chain reaction, and protein16 
with immunohistochemical method. In HPV positive cases, the presence of HPV 
types 16, 18 were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Demographic features 
of patients were noted. Patient survival and association with HPV/protein16 was 
determined.
RESULTS: Polyclonal HPV positivity was detected in 11 (12.2%) of 90 cases. Out 
of these 11 cases, HPV 16 was positive in 6, HPV 18 in 4, and both HPV 16 and 18 
were positive in 1. In 18 (20%) of the cases, p16 was positive. Six of the cases 
(6.6%) had both HPV and protein16 positivity. In cases where protein16 alone or 
HPV and protein16 were co-positive, alcohol use was less and the tumor was found 
more likely to be localized in the supraglottic area. These ratios were 
statistically significant. Supraglottic localization of tumor was determined to 
be increased in protein16 positive cases. The correlation between protein16 
positivity and supraglottic area location was determined to be statistically 
significant (p =  0.011). 55.6% of protein16 positive cases was located in the 
supraglottic region, 33.3% was glottic and 11.1% was transglottic. Although life 
expectancy over 5 years were numerically higher in HPV and protein16 positive 
cases, this was not found to be statistically significant. There was no 
statistically significant relationship between HPV positivity and mean age, 
differentiation, smoking and alcohol use, tumor progression, lymph node 
metastasis, localization, recurrence, cause of mortality and treatment methods 
in our study. The mean follow-up period of our patients was 6.7 years.
CONCLUSION: The close relationship between HPV and oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma could not be shown in larynx malignancy in many studies, including our 
study. Our findings support a limited role of HPV in laryngeal carcinogenesis. 
Protein16 is not a reliable surrogate for HPV status in laryngeal cancers and is 
not a predictor of laryngeal cancer survival. Supraglottic localization of tumor 
was determined to be increased in protein16 positive cases. The correlation 
between protein16 positivity and supraglottic area location was determined to be 
statistically significant. There is a need for more populated clinical trials, 
where neoplastic proliferation is better demonstrated and the accuracy of the 
results obtained is supported by different techniques.

INTRODUÇÃO: O papilomavírus humano é um fator de risco etiológico para um 
subconjunto de carcinoma espinocelular de cabeça e pescoço. Tem sido demonstrado 
que o HPV é um poderoso biomarcador prognóstico para o câncer de orofaringe, mas 
seu papel na laringe ainda não foi explorado em profundidade. Os mecanismos de 
desenvolvimento dos carcinomas de laringe são bastante complexos e controlados 
por vários fatores. Tabagismo e álcool são os fatores de risco mais importantes. 
Estudos recentes indicam que a infecção pelo HPV também desempenha um papel 
importante nos carcinomas da laringe. Os carcinomas laríngeos relacionados ao 
HPV ocorrem especialmente na região supraglótica.
OBJETIVO: Nosso objetivo foi determinar a frequência da positividade para o 
HPV/proteína 16 em pacientes com carcinoma da laringe e a associação da 
positividade para o HPV e/ou proteína 16 com variáveis como idade, sexo, 
tabagismo, localização do tumor, metástase linfonodal, recidiva e sobrevivência 
de carcinoma da laringe em estágio avançado em nosso estudo.
MÉTODO: Este estudo retrospectivo incluiu 90 pacientes com carcinoma laríngeo 
avançado. O grupo controle incluiu 10 amostras de mucosa laríngea normal. A 
presença de HPV foi investigada por anticorpo policlonal através de reação de 
polimerase em cadeia e a proteína 16 por método imunohistoquímico. Nos casos 
positivos para o HPV, a presença dos tipos 16 e 18 do foi avaliada por reação de 
polimerase em cadeia. As características demográficas dos pacientes foram 
observadas. A sobrevida dos pacientes e a associação com HPV/proteína 16 foram 
determinadas.
RESULTADOS: A positividade com anticorpo policlonal do HPV foi detectada em 11 
(12,2%) dos 90 casos. Desses 11 casos, o HPV 16 foi positivo em 6, o HPV 18 em 4 
e o HPV 16 e 18 foram positivos em 1. Em 18 (20%) dos casos, a proteína 16 foi 
positiva. Seis dos casos (6,6%) apresentaram positividade para HPV e proteína16. 
Nos casos positivos apenas para a proteína 16 ou quando HPV e a proteína 16 
foram co-positivos, a ingestão de álcool foi menor e o tumor apresentou maior 
probabilidade de estar localizado na área supraglótica. Essas proporções foram 
estatisticamente significantes. A localização supraglótica do tumor foi maior em 
casos positivos para proteína 16. A correlação entre positividade para proteína 
16 e localização da área supraglótica foi estatisticamente significante (p = 
0,011). Dos casos positivos para proteína 16, 55,6% foram supraglóticos, 33,3% 
glóticos e 11,1% transglóticos. Embora a expectativa de vida acima de 5 anos 
tenha sido numericamente maior nos casos positivos para HPV e proteína 16, isso 
não foi estatisticamente significante. Não houve relação estatisticamente 
significante entre positividade do HPV e média de idade, diferenciação, 
tabagismo e uso de álcool, progressão tumoral, metástase linfonodal, 
localização, recidiva, causa de mortalidade e métodos de tratamento em nosso 
estudo. O período médio de seguimento de nossos pacientes foi de 6,7 anos.
CONCLUSÃO: A estreita relação entre HPV e carcinoma espinocelular orofaríngeo 
não pôde ser demonstrada na laringe em muitos estudos, inclusive no nosso 
estudo. Nossos achados confirmam um papel limitado do HPV na carcinogênese da 
laringe. A proteína 16 não é um substituto confiável para o status do HPV nos 
cânceres de laringe e não é preditor da sobrevida do câncer de laringe. A 
localização supraglótica do tumor foi maior em casos positivos para proteína16. 
A correlação entre positividade para proteína 16 e localização na área 
supraglótica foi determinada como estatisticamente significante. Há necessidade 
de ensaios clínicos com amostras maiores, nos quais a proliferação neoplásica 
seja melhor demonstrada e a precisão dos resultados obtidos seja apoiada por 
diferentes técnicas.

Cost-Effectiveness of Three Doses of a Behavioral Intervention to Prevent or 
Delay Type 2 Diabetes in Rural Areas.

Radcliff TA, Côté MJ, Whittington MD, Daniels MJ, Bobroff LB, Janicke DM, Perri 
MG.

BACKGROUND: Rural Americans have higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 
diabetes (T2D) than urban populations and more limited access to behavioral 
programs to promote healthy lifestyle habits. Descriptive evidence from the 
Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness trial delivered through 
local cooperative extension service offices in rural areas previously identified 
that behavioral modification with both nutrition education and coaching resulted 
in a lower program delivery cost per kilogram of weight loss maintained at 
2-years compared with an education-only comparator intervention.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis extended earlier Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment 
Effectiveness trial research regarding weight loss outcomes to assess whether 
nutrition education with behavioral coaching delivered through cooperative 
extension service offices is cost-effective relative to nutrition education only 
in reducing T2D cases in rural areas.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Trial participants (n=317) from June 2008 through June 
2014 were adults residing in rural Florida counties with a baseline body mass 
index between 30 and 45, but otherwise identified as healthy.
INTERVENTION: Trial participants were randomly assigned to low, moderate, or 
high doses of behavioral coaching with nutrition education (ie, 16, 32, or 48 
sessions over 24 months) or a comparator intervention that included 16 sessions 
of nutrition education without coaching. Participant glycated hemoglobin level 
was measured at baseline and the end of the trial to assess T2D status.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: T2D categories by treatment arm were used to estimate 
participants' expected annual health care expenditures and expected 
health-related utility measured as quality adjusted life years (ie, QALYs) over 
a 5-year time horizon. Discounted incremental costs and QALYs were used to 
calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each behavioral coaching 
intervention dose relative to the education-only comparator.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Using a third-party payer perspective, Markov 
transition matrices were used to model participant transitions between T2D 
states. Replications of the individual participant behavior were conducted using 
Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: All three doses of the behavioral coaching intervention had lower 
expected total costs and higher estimated QALYs than the education-only 
comparator. The moderate dose behavioral coaching intervention was associated 
with higher estimated QALYs but was costlier than the low dose; the moderate 
dose was favored over the low dose with willingness to pay thresholds over 
$107,895/QALY. The low dose behavioral coaching intervention was otherwise 
favored.
CONCLUSIONS: Because most rural Americans live in counties with cooperative 
extension service offices, nutrition education with behavioral coaching programs 
similar to those delivered through this trial may be effective and efficient in 
preventing or delaying T2D-associated consequences of obesity for rural adults.

OBJECTIVE: Among older adult women with early-stage breast cancer who undergo 
lumpectomy, the benefits of radiotherapy vary according to tumor characteristics 
and life expectancy. We aimed to develop a risk calculator to predict 
individualized probability of long-term survival and local recurrence, 
accounting for these factors.
METHODS: We developed a simulation model to estimate an individual patient's 
risk of local recurrence and all-cause mortality according to age, 
comorbidities, functional status, tumor characteristics, and radiotherapy 
status. We integrated two existing prediction models, the Early Breast Cancer 
Trialist's Collaborative Group prediction model for breast cancer specific 
outcomes and ePrognosis for life expectancy. An online risk calculator 
"Radiotherapy for Older Women (ROW)" was developed through an iterative 
multi-stage process, that included individual consultation and group meetings 
with an advisory committee (AC) comprised of patients, advocates, clinicians, 
and researchers.
RESULTS: We developed the tool over 40 months and had 15 group meetings. The 
risk calculator developed as a simulation model with 16 factors (5 
tumor-related, 3 demographic, 4 comorbidities, and 4 functional statuses). 
Across 56,700 simulated scenarios, the benefit of RT in terms of absolute 
10-year local recurrence reduction, ranged from 0% to 34%, depending on 
individual characteristics. Based on feedback from the AC, overall survival and 
local recurrence were chosen as the output for ROW, with these outcomes 
displayed numerically (percentages and natural frequencies) and graphically 
(pictographs).
CONCLUSIONS: This tool "ROW" could facilitate shared decision making regarding 
receipt of radiotherapy for older women with early breast cancer. Additional 
studies to examine usability testing are underway.

BACKGROUND: In the treatment of spinal metastases the risks of surgery must be 
balanced against potential benefits, particularly in light of limited 
life-expectancy. Patient experiences and preferences regarding decision-making 
in this context are not well explored.
PURPOSE: We performed a qualitative study involving patients receiving treatment 
for spinal metastatic disease. We sought to understand factors that influenced 
decision-making around care for spinal metastases.
STUDY SETTING: Three tertiary academic medical centers.
PATIENT SAMPLE: We recruited patients presenting for treatment of spinal 
metastatic disease at one of three tertiary centers in Boston, MA.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We conducted semistructured interviews using a guide that 
probed participants' experiences with making treatment decisions.
METHODS: We performed a thematic analysis that produced a list of themes, 
subthemes, and statement explaining how the themes related to the study's 
guiding questions. Patients were recruited until thematic saturation was 
reached.
RESULTS: We interviewed 23 participants before reaching thematic saturation. The 
enormity of treatment decisions, and of the diagnosis of spinal metastases 
itself, shaped participant preferences for who should take responsibility for 
the decision and whether to accept treatments bearing greater risk of 
complications. Pre-existing participant beliefs about decision-making and about 
surgery interacted with the clinical context in a way that tended to promote 
accepting physician recommendations and delaying or avoiding surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of spinal metastatic disease played an outsized role 
in shaping participant preferences for agency in treatment decision-making. 
Further research should address strategies to support patient understanding of 
treatment options in clinical contexts-such as spinal metastases-characterized 
by ominous underlying disease and high-risk, often urgent interventions.

BACKGROUND: Despite its relative rarity, the potential for loss of productive 
years makes aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) a considerably important 
entity in young adult patients (20-39 years of age). This study aimed to analyze 
outcomes of microsurgery (MS) and endovascular treatment (EVT) for saccular 
intracranial aneurysms (IAs) in young adult patients.
METHODS: A total of 276 young adult patients with 315 IAs, treated with MS or 
EVT between January 2001 and December 2015, were studied. Major recurrence and 
treatment-related complications were the primary outcome measures. Functional 
outcomes in patients with SAH were also assessed.
RESULTS: Major recurrence occurred in 21 cases (6.7%). Younger age (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 3.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-9.83; P = 0.007), 
ruptured IA (aHR, 6.44; 95% CI, 2.09-19.89; P = 0.001), size (aHR, 1.84; 95% CI, 
1.06-3.18; P = 0.030), and EVT (aHR, 7.21; 95% CI, 2.44-21.35; P < 0.001) were 
independently related to major recurrence. Treatment-related complications 
occurred in 5 cases (1.6%) and did not differ between the MS and EVT groups (P > 
0.999). Unfavorable outcomes (modified Rankin scale score ≥2) were identified in 
30 patients (19.6%) with SAH, and only Hunt and Hess grade was independently 
associated with unfavorable functional outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Both MS and EVT are safe for treating IAs in young adult patients. 
MS showed better durability of treatment and may be preferred over EVT in young 
patients in view of their longer life expectancy compared with older patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited data on the most cost-effective 
sequencing of biologics for ulcerative colitis [UC].
METHODS: We used Markov modelling to identify the most cost-effective position 
for vedolizumab among biologics for steroid-dependent UC, with a base-case of a 
35-year-old male. We assessed three treatment algorithms, with vedolizumab use: 
prior to an initial anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNFα] and 
azathioprine [Algorithm 1]; prior to a second anti-TNF and azathioprine 
[Algorithm 2]; and prior to colectomy [Algorithm 3]. The initial anti-TNF could 
be either infliximab or adalimumab. Transition probabilities, costs, and 
quality-adjusted life-year estimates were derived from published estimates, 
Medicare, and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Primary analyses included 100 
trials of 100 000 individuals over 1 year, with a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of US$100,000. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess our 
findings.
RESULTS: From a population perspective, when both infliximab and adalimumab are 
available, vedolizumab was preferred as the first biologic if ≥14% of initial 
anti-TNF use was adalimumab. If infliximab is the primary biologic, vedolizumab 
use after infliximab [Algorithm 2] and prior to adalimumab was the most 
cost-effective strategy. All models were sensitive to biologic pricing.
CONCLUSIONS: This simulation demonstrated that the most cost-effective strategy 
in UC depends on the proportion of patients using adalimumab as the initial 
anti-TNF. If adalimumab was ≥14%, vedolizumab was preferred as the first 
biologic. When only infliximab was available for first-line therapy, the most 
cost-effective position of vedolizumab was prior to cycling to adalimumab.

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The rise in 
suicide rates is contributing to the recently observed decline in life 
expectancy. While previous research identified a solid association between 
economic strain and suicide, little attention has been paid to how specific 
welfare policies that are designed to alleviate economic strain may influence 
suicide rates. There is a growing body of research that is using an 
institutional approach to demonstrate the role of welfare-state policies in the 
distribution of health. However, this perspective has not been applied yet to 
the investigation of suicide. In this study, I combine these approaches to 
analyze the association between two specific policies, Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and overall and 
gender-specific suicide rates across the 50 U.S. states between 2000 and 2015. I 
estimate two-way fixed-effects longitudinal models and find evidence of a robust 
association between one of these policies - SNAP - and overall and male suicide. 
After adjusting for a number of confounding factors, higher participation in 
SNAP is associated with lower overall and male suicide rates. Increasing SNAP 
participation by one standard deviation (4.5% of the state population) during 
the study period could have saved the lives of approximately 31,600 people 
overall and 24,800 men.

The interaction of typical host adapted enteric bacterial pathogens with fresh 
produce grown in fields is complex. These interactions can be more pronounced in 
co-managed or sustainable farms where animal operations are, by design, close to 
fresh produce, and growers frequently move between the two production 
environments. The primary objectives of this study were to 1) determine the 
transmission of STEC or enteric pathogens from small and large animal herds or 
operations to fresh produce on sustainable farms in TN and NC, 2) identify the 
possible sources that impact transmission of AMR E. coli, specifically STEC on 
these systems, and 3) WGS to characterize recovered E. coli from these sources. 
Samples were collected from raw and composted manure, environment, and produce 
sources. The serotype, virulence, and genotypic resistance profile were 
determined using the assembled genome sequences sequenced by Illumina 
technology. Broth microdilution was used to determine the antimicrobial 
susceptibility of each isolate against a panel of fourteen antimicrobials. The 
prevalence of E. coli increased during the summer season for all sources tested. 
ParSNP trees generated demonstrated that the transmission of AMR E. coli is 
occurring between animal feeding operations and fresh produce. Ten isolates were 
identified as serotype O45, a serotype that is associated with the "Big Six" 
group that is frequently linked with foodborne outbreaks caused by non-O157 E. 
coli. However, these isolates did not possess the stx gene. The highest 
frequency of resistance was detected against streptomycin (n = 225), ampicillin 
(n = 190) and sulfisoxazole FIS (n = 140). A total of 35 (13.7%) isolates from 
two TN farms were positive for the blaCMY (n = 5) and blaTEM (n = 32) genes. The 
results of this study show the potential of AMR E. coli transmission between 
animal feeding operations and fresh produce, and more studies are recommended to 
study this interaction and prevent dissemination in sustainable farming systems.

Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) are typically derived from individual 
preferences over health episodes. This paper reports the first experimental 
investigation into the effects of collective decision making on health 
valuations, using both time trade-off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) tasks. We 
investigated collective decision making in dyads, by means of a mixed-subjects 
design where we control for learning effects. Our data suggest that collective 
decision making has little effect on decision quality, as no effects were 
observed on decision consistency and monotonicity for both methods. Furthermore, 
QALY weights remained similar between individual and collective decisions, and 
the typical difference in elicited weights between TTO and SG was not affected. 
These findings suggest that consulting with others has little effect on health 
state valuation, although learning may have. Additionally, our findings add to 
the literature of the effect of collective decision making, suggesting that no 
such effect occurs for TTO and SG.

INTRODUCTION: The NCT00339183 trial demonstrated that adding panitumumab to 
fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line therapy of 
wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) increases the median 
progression-free survival (PFS). Nevertheless, panitumumab is not yet approved 
in China, and the costs and outcomes of the therapy are still unclear. We 
estimated the cost-effectiveness of this intervention from the perspective of 
Chinese health care systems by constructing two pricing scenarios for 
panitumumab. Scenario 1: Pricing is based on the price of a similar product 
(cetuximab) in China. Scenario 2: We estimated the value-based price.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was created based on the results of the 
NCT00339183 trial, which evaluated panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI. The 
model simulated the disease progression. We calculated medical costs from the 
perspectives of the Chinese health care systems. The primary outcome measures 
were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: In scenario 1, compared with FOLFIRI alone, FOLFIRI with panitumumab 
arm had an ICER of ¥1,539,988/QALY. The most influential factors were the mean 
overall survival (OS), utility before progression and cost of panitumumab. The 
probability of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI being cost-effective in China was 0% 
when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was ¥193,932/QALY. In scenario 2, 
when the cost of panitumumab was assumed to be ¥4032.61 or ¥5218.96 per cycle, 
the ICERs approximated the WTP thresholds of ¥193,932/QALY or ¥420,633/QALY, 
respectively. In this value-based pricing scenario, panitumumab plus FOLFIRI is 
estimated to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: We construct two pricing scenarios in China. In scenario 1, 
panitumumab plus FOLFIRI as a second-line therapy of mCRC provided an 
incremental benefit, but simultaneously increased costs (at the current price) 
even further. In scenario 2, when the value-based price was adopted, panitumumab 
plus FOLFIRI was estimated to be cost-effective. Our study establishes a pricing 
framework for new anticancer drugs to reflect the economics of drugs.
