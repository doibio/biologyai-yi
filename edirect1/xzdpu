RESULTS: From 2010 to 2018, the annual dialysis-related mortality rate in Taiwan 
increased from 10.6 to 11.8 deaths per hundred patient-years. The mortality rate 
for patients below 40 years appears to be decreasing, reflecting the improved 
quality of care for ESKD patients. Patients above 75 years showed increasing 
mortality, indicating the prolonged survival and aging of the ESKD population. 
Patients undergoing dialysis who participated in the pre-ESRD care program had a 
higher post-dialysis initiation life expectancy than those who did not 
participate. Among the program enrollees, the post-dialysis initiation life 
expectancy was higher in patients who had participated for more than one year. 
Taiwan has one of the highest ESKD patient survival rates globally.
CONCLUSION: From 2010 to 2018, the reduced mortality in young patients and aging 
of the ESKD population might indicate that the quality of care in Taiwan for 
ESKD has improved. Furthermore, a better survival rate after dialysis initiation 
was observed in the pre-ESRD care program participants.

OBJECTIVES: Estimating the maximum acceptable cost (MAC) per screened individual 
for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer (LC) screening, and 
determining the effect of additionally screening for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), or both on the MAC.
METHODS: A model-based early health technology assessment (HTA) was conducted to 
estimate whether a new intervention could be cost-effective by calculating the 
MAC at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of €20k/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
€80k/QALY, for a population of current and former smokers, aged 50-75 years in 
The Netherlands. The MAC was estimated based on incremental QALYs gained from a 
stage shift assuming screened individuals are detected in earlier disease 
stages. Data were obtained from literature and publicly available statistics and 
validated with experts.
RESULTS: The MAC per individual for implementing LC screening at a WTP of 
€20k/QALY was €113. If COPD, CVD, or both were included in screening, the MAC 
increased to €230, €895, or €971 respectively. Scenario analyses assessed 
whether screening-specific disease high-risk populations would improve 
cost-effectiveness, showing that high-risk CVD populations were more likely to 
improve economic viability compared to COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic viability of combined screening is substantially 
larger than for LC screening alone, primarily due to benefits from CVD 
screening, and is dependent on the target screening population, which is key to 
optimise the screening program. The total cost of breast and cervical cancer 
screening is lower (€420) than the MAC of Big-3, indicating that Big-3 screening 
may be acceptable from a health economic perspective.
KEY POINTS: • Once-off combined low-dose CT screening for lung cancer, COPD, and 
CVD in individuals aged 50-75 years is potentially cost-effective if screening 
would cost less than €971 per screened individual. • Multi-disease screening 
requires detailed insight into the co-occurrence of these diseases to identify 
the optimal target screening population. • With the same target screening 
population and WTP, lung cancer-only screening should cost less than €113 per 
screened individual to be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: In the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-181 study, pembrolizumab 
prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy as second-line 
therapy in patients with advanced esophageal cancer and programmed death-ligand 
1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥10. We report a post hoc subgroup 
analysis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) enrolled in 
KEYNOTE-181 in Asia, including patients from the KEYNOTE-181 China extension 
study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty Asian patients with 
advanced/metastatic ESCC were enrolled in KEYNOTE-181, including the China 
cohort. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg 
every 3 weeks for ≤2 years or investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or 
irinotecan. OS, progression-free survival, response, and safety were analyzed 
without formal comparisons. OS was evaluated based on PD-L1 CPS expression 
level.
RESULTS: In Asian patients with ESCC, median OS was 10.0 months with 
pembrolizumab and 6.5 months with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% CI 
0.50-0.80; nominal P < 0.0001]. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months 
with pembrolizumab and 3.1 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99; 
nominal P = 0.020). Objective response rate was 17.1% with pembrolizumab and 
7.1% with chemotherapy; median duration of response was 10.5 months and 7.7 
months, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 tumors (pembrolizumab versus 
chemotherapy), the HR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.56-1.72); the HR (95% CI) for death was 
better for patients with PD-L1 CPS cut-offs >1 [CPS ≥1, 0.57 (0.44-0.75); CPS 
≥5, 0.56 (0.41-0.76); CPS ≥10, 0.53 (0.37-0.75)]. Treatment-related adverse 
events were reported in 71.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab group and 89.8% 
in the chemotherapy group; grade 3-5 events were reported in 20.0% and 44.6%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated promising efficacy in Asian 
patients with ESCC, with fewer treatment-related adverse events than 
chemotherapy. PD-L1 CPS ≥1 is an appropriate cut-off and a predictive marker of 
pembrolizumab efficacy in Asian patients with ESCC.

Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer (PC) represents a challenge before 
multidisciplinary team (MDT), typically includes not only local disease control 
but also systemic therapy and it should be tailored to each individual patient. 
We present a case of a 58-year-old man, whose PC presented itself as a locally 
advanced disease. Bearing in mind the patients' age, absence of comorbidities 
but also his preferences, MDT decided that the rational first step in almost 
imminent multimodal treatment should be radical prostatectomy (RP). Due to 
several local adverse factors (positive surgical margins, extracapsular 
extension, seminal vesicle involvement) on RP specimen pathohistology and 
postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 6.69 ng/ml our MDT determined 
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy in the course of 3 
years plus immediate salvage radiotherapy. The therapy was well tolerated, 
although there was one episode of transitory radiation cystitis roughly one year 
after its completion. After 45 months of follow-up the patient is without signs 
of biochemical recurrence of PC, with fully restored testosterone level and good 
quality of life. The main task in advanced PC management, through 
multidisciplinary approach, is providing good oncological outcome while trying 
to reduce treatment morbidity and to maintain a good quality of life.

In this review, we will discuss zebrafish as a model for studying mechanisms of 
human fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). We will overview the studies on 
FASDs so far and will discuss with specific focus on the mechanisms by which 
alcohol alters cell migration during the early embryogenesis including blastula, 
gastrula, and organogenesis stages which later cause morphological defects in 
the brain and other tissues. FASDs are caused by an elevated alcohol level in 
the pregnant mother's body. The symptoms of FASDs include microcephaly, 
holoprosencephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, and cardiac defects with birth 
defect in severe cases, and in milder cases, the symptoms lead to developmental 
and learning disabilities. The transparent zebrafish embryo offers an ideal 
model system to investigate the genetic, cellular, and organismal responses to 
alcohol. In the zebrafish, the effects of alcohol were observed in many places 
during the embryo development from the stem cell gene expression at the 
blastula/gastrula stage, gastrulation cell movement, morphogenesis of the 
central nervous system, and neuronal development. The data revealed that ethanol 
suppresses convergence, extension, and epiboly cell movement at the gastrula 
stage and cause the failure of normal neural plate formation. Subsequently, 
other cell movements including neurulation, eye field morphogenesis, and neural 
crest migration are also suppressed, leading to the malformation of the brain 
and spinal cord, including microcephaly, cyclopia, spinal bifida, and 
craniofacial abnormalities. The testing cell migration in zebrafish would 
provide convenient biomarkers for the toxicity of alcohol and other related 
chemicals, and investigate the molecular link between the target signaling 
pathways, following brain development.

Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a 
multisystem medical condition with heterogeneous symptom expression. Currently, 
there is no effective cure or treatment for the standard care of patients. A 
variety of ME/CFS symptoms can be linked to the vital life functions of the 
brainstem, the lower extension of the brain best known as the hub relaying 
information back and forth between the cerebral cortex and various parts of the 
body. Objective/Methods: Over the past decade, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
studies have emerged to understand ME/CFS with interesting findings, but there 
has lacked a synthesized evaluation of what has been found thus far regarding 
the involvement of the brainstem. We conducted this study to review and evaluate 
the recent MRI findings via a literature search of the MEDLINE database, from 
which 11 studies met the eligibility criteria. Findings: Data showed that MRI 
studies frequently reported structural changes in the white and gray matter. 
Abnormalities of the functional connectivity within the brainstem and with other 
brain regions have also been found. The studies have suggested possible 
mechanisms including astrocyte dysfunction, cerebral perfusion impairment, 
impaired nerve conduction, and neuroinflammation involving the brainstem, which 
may at least partially explain a substantial portion of the ME/CFS symptoms and 
their heterogeneous presentations in individual patients. Conclusions: This 
review draws research attention to the role of the brainstem in ME/CFS, helping 
enlighten future work to uncover the pathologies and mechanisms of this complex 
medical condition, for improved management and patient care.

Predominantly antibody deficiencies (PAD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders 
characterized by dysfunctional antibody production, low immunoglobulin levels in 
serum and impaired vaccine responses. The clinical picture is variable, ranging 
from mild symptoms to severe complications, which may include autoimmunity, 
gastrointestinal disease, allergy, and malignancies. If left untreated, PAD 
patients are at risk of enduring disease progression, irreversible organ damage, 
and reduced life expectancy. A timely diagnosis has been shown to significantly 
improve disease prognosis. Here, we report on our experience using targeted gene 
panel sequencing by employing Agilent's HaloPlex or SureSelect and Illumina's 
MiSeq technologies in a cohort of 291 individuals who presented with low or 
absent immunoglobulin levels in combination with or without other clinical 
features. In total, we have detected over 57 novel or previously reported 
relevant mutations in ADA, ADA2, BTK, CTLA4, LRBA, NFKB1, NFKB2, PIK3CD, STAT3, 
and TNFRSF13B. Overall, a genetic diagnosis could be made in 24.7% of the 
investigated patients. The percentage of coverage for the targeted regions 
ranged from 90% to 98% in this study. Moreover, functional assays were performed 
on a defined group of the patients carrying candidate variants in CTLA4, LRBA, 
NFKB1 and BTK, which confirmed their deleterious effect on protein expression 
and/or function. This study reiterates that the immunological heterogeneity of 
predominantly antibody deficiencies may have a diverse genetic origin, although 
certain clinical features may hint towards a specific group of defects. 
Employing targeted sequencing panels proves to be a very time- and 
cost-efficient, yet reliable, method for the establishment of a genetic 
diagnosis in individuals with PAD. However, in case of negative panel results, 
or if functional testing reveals inconspicuous observations in patients with a 
clear indication for genetic testing, further work-up including whole exome or 
whole genome sequencing should be considered.

Androgen Elevation Accelerates Reproductive Senescence in Three-Spined 
Stickleback.

Costs of reproduction shape the life-history evolution of investment in current 
and future reproduction and thereby aging. Androgens have been proposed to 
regulate the physiology governing these investments. Furthermore, androgens are 
hypothesized to play a central role in carotenoid-dependent sexual signaling, 
regulating how much carotenoids are diverted to ornamentation and away from 
somatic maintenance, increasing oxidative stress, and accelerating aging. We 
investigated these relationships in male three-spined stickleback in which we 
elevated 11-ketotestosterone and supplied vitamin E, an antioxidant, in a 2 × 2 
design. Androgen elevation shortened the time stickleback maintained 
reproductive activities. We suspect that this effect is caused by 
11-ketotestosterone stimulating investment in current reproduction, but we 
detected no evidence for this in our measurements of reproductive effort: nest 
building, body composition, and breeding coloration. Carotenoid-dependent 
coloration was even slightly decreased by 11-ketotestosterone elevation and was 
left unaffected by vitamin E. Red coloration correlated with life expectancy and 
reproductive capacity in a quadratic manner, suggesting overinvestment of the 
individuals exhibiting the reddest bellies. In contrast, blue iris color showed 
a negative relationship with survival, suggesting physiological costs of 
producing this aspect of nuptial coloration. In conclusion, our results support 
the hypothesis that androgens regulate investment in current versus future 
reproduction, yet the precise mechanisms remain elusive. The quadratic 
relationships between sexual signal expression and aspects of quality have wider 
consequences for how we view sexual selection on ornamentation and its 
relationship with aging.

Brno urban dataset: Winter extension.

Ligocki A(1), Jelinek A(1), Zalud L(1).

Author information:
(1)Brno University of Technology, Technicka 12, Brno 612 00, Czechia.

This paper presents our latest extension of the Brno Urban Dataset (BUD), the 
Winter Extension (WE). The dataset contains data from commonly used sensors in 
the automotive industry, like four RGB and single IR cameras, three 3D LiDARs, 
differential RTK GNSS receiver with heading estimation, the IMU and FMCW radar. 
Data from all sensors are precisely timestamped for future offline 
interpretation and data fusion. The most significant gain of the dataset is the 
focus on the winter conditions in snow-covered environments. Only a few public 
datasets deal with these kinds of conditions. We recorded the dataset during 
February 2021 in Brno, Czechia, when fresh snow covers the entire city and the 
surrounding countryside. The dataset contains situations from the city center, 
suburbs, highways as well as the countryside. Overall, the new extension adds 
three hours of real-life traffic situations from the mid-size city to the 
existing 10 h of original records. Additionally, we provide the precalculated

Crocodiles are flourishing large-bodied ectotherms in a world dominated by 
endotherms. They survived the Cretaceous extinction event, that eradicated the 
dinosaurs who are thought to be their ancestral hosts. Crocodiles reside in 
polluted environments; and often inhabit water which contains heavy metals; 
frequent exposure to radiation; feed on rotten meat and considered as one of the 
hardy species that has successfully survived on this planet for millions of 
years. Another capability that crocodiles possess is their longevity. Crocodiles 
live much longer than similar-sized land mammals, sometimes living up to 100 
years. But how do they withstand such harsh conditions that are detrimental to 
Homo sapiens? Given the importance of gut microbiome on its' host physiology, we 
postulate that the crocodile gut microbiome and/or its' metabolites produce 
substances contributing to their "hardiness" and longevity. Thus, we 
accomplished literature search in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and 
herein, we discuss the composition of the crocodile gut microbiome, longevity 
and cellular senescence in crocodiles, their resistance to infectious diseases 
and cancer, and our current knowledge of the genome and epigenome of these 
remarkable species. Furthermore, preliminary studies that demonstrate the 
remarkable properties of crocodile gut microbial flora are discussed. Given the 
profound role of the gut microbiome in the health of its' host, it is likely 
that the crocodile gut microbiome and its' metabolites may be contributing to 
their extended life expectancy and elucidating the underlying mechanisms and 
properties of these metabolites may hold clues to developing new treatments for 
age-related diseases for the benefit of Homo sapiens.

RNA editing is currently attracting attention as a method for editing genetic 
information without injury to the genome. The most common approach to edit RNA 
sequences involves the induction of an A-to-I change by adenosine deaminase 
acting on RNA (ADAR). However, this method only allows point editing. Here, we 
report a highly flexible RNA editing method called "RNA overwriting" that 
employs the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) comprising PA, 
PB1, and PB2 subunits. RdRp binds to the 5'-cap structure of the host mRNA and 
cleaves at the AG site, followed by transcription of the viral RNA; this process 
is called cap-snatching. We engineered a targeting snatch system wherein the 
target RNA is cleaved and extended at any site addressed by guide RNA (gRNA). We 
constructed five recombinant RdRps containing a PB2 mutant and demonstrated the 
editing capability of RdRp mutants by using short RNAs in vitro. 
PB2-480-containing RdRp exhibited good performance in both cleavage and 
extension assays; we succeeded in RNA overwriting using PB2-480-containing RdRp. 
In principle, this method allows RNA editing of any type including mutation, 
addition, and deletion, by changing the sequence of the template RNA to the 
sequence of interest; hence, the use of viral RdRp could open new avenues in RNA 
editing and be a powerful tool in life science.

PURPOSE: Prosthesis geometry and behaviour limit the footwear options available 
to women. Using a commercially available prosthetic foot that permits 
user-alignment to accommodate shoes with different heel heights, we investigated 
the effect of footwear on gait kinematics, with and without adjustment for 
differences in heel-forefoot differential.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three women with transtibial amputation walked at a 
self-selected pace, first in an athletic shoe (prosthetist-aligned; baseline 
condition), then (i) in a flatter shoe without realigning the prosthesis, and 
(ii) in flat and heeled shoes following user re-alignment. Kinematics in each 
condition were compared to baseline.
RESULTS: Baseline gait patterns were highly variable across participants. Gait 
was slower in comparison to baseline in all conditions, but movement 
compensations varied across participants. An increased lower limb extension 
tendency was evident with the misaligned prosthesis. With user re-alignment to 
accommodate the shoe there were fewer deviations from baseline, however 
kinematic differences remained in both the flat and heeled shoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The user-alignment feature of the prosthetic foot reduced the 
effect of a change in footwear on kinematics, and permitted walking in heeled 
shoes when it might otherwise not be possible. Persistence of some deviations 
suggests differences in walking task demand remained despite 
adjustment.Implications for rehabilitationPermitting prosthesis users to don 
footwear of choice may improve body image, well-being and quality of life 
following amputation.Prosthetic feet that permit user ankle adjustment can 
reduce gait deviations associated with a change in footwear heel height, 
although kinematic adaptations are individual.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: With the population aging, the incidence of early gastric 
cancer (EGC) is increasing. We aimed to clarify the indications for endoscopic 
resection (ER) in late-elderly patients with EGC in terms of life expectancy.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years who underwent ER for EGC at our institution 
from January 2007 to December 2012 were enrolled. Clinical data, including 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), Charlson 
comorbidity index, and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), were collected at the 
time of ER. Overall survival (OS) was the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: Four hundred consecutive patients were enrolled. Mean patient age was 
79.3 years (range, 75-93). The 5-year follow-up rate was 89.0% (median follow-up 
period, 5.6 years). Five-year OS was 80.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
76.4-84.4), and 5-year net survival standardized for age, sex, and calendar year 
was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.03-1.15). With a multivariate analysis, ECOG-PS 2 to 4 
(hazard ratio, 8.84; 95% CI, 3.07-25.4), PNI <49.1 (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 
1.53-4.06), and eCura C-2 (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11-2.88) were 
independent prognostic factors. When none of these factors was met, the 5-year 
OS rate was 90.4% (95% CI, 84.0-94.3).
CONCLUSIONS: ER for EGC in late-elderly patients may improve life expectancy. ER 
is recommended in patients with a good ECOG-PS and PNI and in whom ER is 
expected to be non-eCura C-2.

More than 40% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) in the United 
States smoke tobacco cigarettes. Among those on antiretroviral therapy, smoking 
decreases life expectancy more than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) itself. 
Most PWH who smoke want to quit, but tobacco dependence treatment has not been 
widely integrated into HIV care. This article summarizes the epidemiology of 
tobacco use among PWH, health consequences of tobacco use and benefits of 
cessation in PWH, and studies of treatment for tobacco dependence among the 
general population and among PWH. We provide practical guidance for providers to 
treat tobacco dependence among PWH. A 3-step Ask-Advise-Connect framework 
includes asking about tobacco use routinely during clinical encounters, advising 
about tobacco cessation with emphasis on the benefits of cessation, and actively 
connecting patients to cessation treatments, including prescription of 
pharmacotherapy (preferably varenicline) and direct connection to behavioral 
interventions via telephone quitline or other means to increase the likelihood 
of a successful quit attempt.

BACKGROUND: Treatment personalization via tumor molecular testing holds promise 
for improving outcomes for patients with pediatric low-grade glioma (PLGG). We 
evaluate the health economic impact of employing tumor molecular testing to 
guide treatment for patients diagnosed with PLGG, particularly the avoidance of 
radiation therapy (RT) for patients with BRAF-fusion.
METHODS: We performed a model-based cost-utility analysis comparing two 
strategies: molecular testing to determine BRAF fusion status at diagnosis 
against no molecular testing. We developed a microsimulation to model the 
lifetime health and cost outcomes (in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
2018 CAD, respectively) for a simulated cohort of 100,000 patients newly 
diagnosed with PLGG after their initial surgery.
RESULTS: The life expectancy after diagnosis for individuals who did not receive 
molecular testing was 39.01 (95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 32.94;44.38) years 
and 40.08 (95% CI: 33.19;45.76) years for those who received testing. Our 
findings indicate that patients who received molecular testing at diagnosis 
experienced a 0.38 (95% CI: 0.08;0.77) gain in QALYs and $1384 (95% CI: $-3486; 
$1204) reduction in costs over their lifetime. Cost and QALY benefits were 
driven primarily by the avoidance of long-term adverse events (stroke, secondary 
neoplasms) associated with unnecessary use of radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of 
molecular testing in guiding the decision to provide RT in PLGG. While our 
results do not consider the impact of targeted therapies, this work is an 
example of the value of simulation modeling in assessing the long-term costs and 
benefits of precision oncology interventions for childhood cancer, which can aid 
decision-making about health system reimbursement.

BACKGROUND: People with liver disease are at increased risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, there has yet been an investigation of 
incidence burden, risk, and premature mortality across a wide range of liver 
conditions and cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: We employed population-wide electronic health records (EHRs; from 1998 
to 2020) consisting of almost 4 million adults to assess regional variations in 
disease burden of five liver conditions, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), 
autoimmune liver disease, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV), chronic hepatitis 
C infection (HCV) and NAFLD, in England. We analysed regional differences in 
incidence rates for 17 manifestations of CVD in people with or without liver 
disease. The associations between biomarkers and comorbidities and risk of CVD 
in patients with liver disease were estimated using Cox models. For each liver 
condition, we estimated excess years of life lost (YLL) attributable to CVD 
(i.e., difference in YLL between people with or without CVD).
RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate for any liver disease was 114.5 per 
100,000 person years. The highest incidence was observed in NAFLD (85.5), 
followed by ALD (24.7), HCV (6.0), HBV (4.1) and autoimmune liver disease (3.7). 
Regionally, the North West and North East regions consistently exhibited high 
incidence burden. Age-specific incidence rate analyses revealed that the peak 
incidence for liver disease of non-viral aetiology is reached in individuals 
aged 50-59 years. Patients with liver disease had a two-fold higher incidence 
burden of CVD (2634.6 per 100,000 persons) compared to individuals without liver 
disease (1339.7 per 100,000 persons). When comparing across liver diseases, 
atrial fibrillation was the most common initial CVD presentation while 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the least common. We noted strong positive 
associations between body mass index and current smoking and risk of CVD. 
Patients who also had diabetes, hypertension, proteinuric kidney disease, 
chronic kidney disease, diverticular disease and gastro-oesophageal reflex 
disorders had a higher risk of CVD, as do patients with low albumin, raised 
C-reactive protein and raised International Normalized Ratio levels. All types 
of CVD were associated with shorter life expectancies. When evaluating excess 
YLLs by age of CVD onset and by liver disease type, differences in YLLs, when 
comparing across CVD types, were more pronounced at younger ages.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a public online app ( 
https://lailab.shinyapps.io/cvd_in_liver_disease/ ) to showcase results 
interactively. We provide a blueprint that revealed previously underappreciated 
clinical factors related to the risk of CVD, which differed in the magnitude of 
effects across liver diseases. We found significant geographical variations in 
the burden of liver disease and CVD, highlighting the need to devise local 
solutions. Targeted policies and regional initiatives addressing underserved 
communities might help improve equity of access to CVD screening and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Hip osteoarthritis is a common disabling condition of the hip joint 
and is associated with a substantial health burden. We assessed the 
epidemiological patterns of hip osteoarthritis from 1990 to 2019 by sex, age, 
and socio-demographic index (SDI).
METHODS: Age-standardized rates (ASRs) were obtained for the incidence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of hip osteoarthritis from 1990 to 2019 
for 21 regions, encompassing a total of 204 countries and territories. The 
estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of ASRs were calculated to evaluate 
the trends in the incidence and DALYs of hip osteoarthritis over these 30 years.
RESULTS: Globally, from 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) 
of hip osteoarthritis increased from 17.02 per 100,000 persons to 18.70 per 
100,000 persons, with an upward trend in the EAPC of 0.32 (0.29-0.34), whereas 
the age-standardized DALY rate increased from 11.54 per 100,000 persons to 12.57
