criteria. Neonates born to women colonized with GBS were at risk for early-onset 
GBS disease, disability, and death. We assumed a GBS prevalence of 25%, that 
26.6% of women labored between 35 weeks of gestation and their scheduled time 
for cesarean delivery, and that 3.3% who planned a repeat cesarean delivery 
instead delivered vaginally. The primary outcome was cost per neonatal 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, with a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Neonatal quality of life was assessed 
using five health states (healthy, mild, moderate, or severe disability, and 
death) with a life expectancy of 79 years for healthy neonates. One-way 
sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses were used to evaluate the results.
RESULTS: In the base case, universal GBS screening in women planning a repeat 
cesarean delivery was not cost-effective compared with no screening, costing 
$114,445 per neonatal quality-adjusted life-year gained. The cost to prevent an 
adverse outcome from GBS exceeded $400,000. If greater than 28% of women were 
GBS-positive, greater than 29% labored before their scheduled delivery, or 
greater than 10% delivered vaginally, universal screening became cost effective.
CONCLUSION: Universal GBS screening in women with a singleton pregnancy planning 
a repeat cesarean delivery may not be cost-effective in all populations. 
However, in populations with a high GBS prevalence, women at high risk of 
laboring before their scheduled cesarean delivery, or women who may ultimately 
opt for a vaginal delivery, GBS screening may be cost effective.

BACKGROUND: The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommended either no statin therapy or 
moderate-intensity statin therapy (MST) for intermediate risk patients-those 
with 5-7.5% 10-year risk and without cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. The guideline further suggested that the 
therapy choice be based on patient-clinician discussions of risks and benefits. 
Since low-density lipoprotein particle (LDL-P) levels were reported to be 
associated with CVD independently of traditional risk factors in intermediate 
and low risk patients, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of using LDL-P 
levels to identify intermediate risk patients likely to benefit from initiating 
or intensifying statin therapy.
METHODS: We evaluated 5 care strategies for intermediate risk patients. These 
included the strategies suggested by the guideline: no-statin therapy and MST. 
We compared each of these strategies to a related strategy that incorporated 
LDL-P testing. No-statin therapy was compared with the strategy of MST for those 
with high LDL-P levels and no statin therapy for all other patients 
(test-and-MST). MST was compared with the strategy of high-intensity statin 
therapy (HST) for those with high LDL-P levels and MST for all other patients 
(test-and-HST). We also evaluated the strategy of HST for all. Costs (payer 
perspective) and utilities were assessed over a 5-year time horizon in a Markov 
model of 100,000 hypothetical intermediate risk patients.
RESULTS: HST dominated all other strategies, costing less and-despite causing 
739 more cases of diabetes than did MST-resulting in more quality adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). For patient-clinician discussions that would otherwise lead 
to the MST strategy, we found the test-and-HST strategy reduced costs by $4.67 
MM and resulted in 134 fewer CVD events and 115 additional QALYs. For 
patient-clinician discussions that would otherwise lead to no statin therapy, we 
found that the test-and-MST strategy reduced costs by $3.25 MM, resulted in 97 
fewer CVD events and 44 additional QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The HST strategy was cost saving and improved outcomes in 
intermediate risk patients. For patient and clinicians concerned about the 
adverse events associated with HST, using LDL-P levels to target intensified 
statin therapy could improve outcomes and reduce costs.

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
INTRODUCTION: Long-term survival of a patient with a Ewing sarcoma family of 
tumors/primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central spine with pathologic 
fracture and extradural extension is presented. Literature-based evidence for a 
survival benefit with modern neoadjuvant chemotherapy and en bloc resection with 
and without radiotherapy is reviewed.
CASE REPORT: More than 10-year clinical and radiographic follow-up is given for 
a 14-cm-diameter tumor originating from the L4 body with pathologic fracture, 
unilateral pedicle involvement, and extradural canal extension. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy led to 90% tumor regression and the authors' subsequent en bloc 
resection attempt. The postoperative chemotherapy was resumed early and 
postoperative radiotherapy was administered owing to positive microscopic 
margins. The patient is alive more than 10 years after completing treatment and 
is without evidence of recurrent disease or secondary malignancy. Late effects 
of chemotherapy are limited to mild cardiomyopathy controlled with medication.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors of the spinal column accounts 
for approximately 2% of Ewing sarcoma lesions of the skeletal system; local and 
systemic relapses are higher than for the extremity sites. Survival is enhanced 
by en bloc surgical resection in cases where clear margins are obtained, but the 
prognosis of patients with central (spine and pelvis) sites is typically poor. 
This case adds to the literature with documentation of high quality of life with 
long-term, disease-free survival after modern chemotherapy surgical intervention 
and combined radiotherapy, a finding suggested in recent large Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results database studies and smaller case series of this 
uncommon, high-grade spinal tumor. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with attempted en 
bloc resection, and postoperative radiotherapy to the resected tumor bed if 
there are microscopic positive margins, can still lead to long-term, 
disease-free survival.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained database.
OBJECTIVES: To review myelomeningocele patients with severe kyphosis undergoing 
kyphectomy surgery in terms of complications and clinical and radiographic 
outcomes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Because of posterior element abnormality in 
myelomeningocele, the extensor muscles act as perverted flexors, driving 
progressive kyphosis that resulted in sitting, respiratory, and skin breakdown 
problems.
METHODS: Clinical case notes and x-rays of seven myelomeningocele patients 
undergoing kyphectomy surgery were reviewed with a minimum follow-up of 24 
months. They consisted of four males and three females with an average age of 
9.5 years at surgery. Surgery was performed in three despite open pressure 
ulcers that failed to heal. These wounds were all closed primarily at initial 
operation, and no flaps were required. Pedicle screw and sublaminar wire 
constructs were utilized with iliac screws for distal control.
RESULTS: The median surgical time was 245 minutes (165-285), with an estimated 
blood loss of 700 mL (500-2,550). The preoperative kyphosis of 142 degrees 
(90-180) was corrected to 15 degrees (5-45) representing a 92% correction. All 
experienced improved sitting. There were no early complications but 2 patients 
with preoperative pressure ulcers returned at 13 months with recurrent sepsis 
and wound breakdown. Their osteotomy had fused, and the infection settled after 
instrumentation removal and antibiotic administration.
CONCLUSION: Although an infrequent presentation today, severe kyphosis in 
myelomeningocele patients causes not only a major functional impairment but 
threat to their life with apical pressure sores. Kyphectomy and posterior 
instrumented spinal fusion can be performed safely, even in the face of an open 
sore with excellent kyphotic correction and resultant improved functionality and 
ability to sit. These open sores can be closed primarily without the requirement 
of plastic surgery as a result of the shortening and extension of the spine.

Diarrheal diseases (DD) are leading causes of disease burden, death, and 
disability, especially in children in low-income settings. DD can also impact a 
child's potential livelihood through stunted physical growth, cognitive 
impairment, and other sequelae. As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study, 
we estimated DD burden, and the burden attributable to specific risk factors and 
particular etiologies, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 1990 
and 2013. For both sexes and all ages, we calculated disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), which are the sum of years of life lost and years lived with 
disability. We estimate that over 125,000 deaths (3.6% of total deaths) were due 
to DD in the EMR in 2013, with a greater burden of DD in low- and middle-income 
countries. Diarrhea deaths per 100,000 children under 5 years of age ranged from 
one (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 0-1) in Bahrain and Oman to 471 (95% UI = 
245-763) in Somalia. The pattern for diarrhea DALYs among those under 5 years of 
age closely followed that for diarrheal deaths. DALYs per 100,000 ranged from 
739 (95% UI = 520-989) in Syria to 40,869 (95% UI = 21,540-65,823) in Somalia. 
Our results highlighted a highly inequitable burden of DD in EMR, mainly driven 
by the lack of access to proper resources such as water and sanitation. Our 
findings will guide preventive and treatment interventions which are based on 
evidence and which follow the ultimate goal of reducing the DD burden.

BACKGROUND: The Aboriginal people of Australia have much poorer health and 
social indicators and a substantial life expectancy gap compared to other 
Australians, with premature cardiovascular disease a major contributor to poorer 
health. This article draws on research undertaken to examine cardiovascular 
disparities and focuses on ways in which primary care practitioners can 
contribute to reducing cardiovascular disparities and improving Aboriginal 
health.
METHODS: The overall research utilised mixed methods and included data analysis, 
interviews and group processes which included Aboriginal people, service 
providers and policymakers. Workshop discussions to identify barriers and what 
works were recorded by notes and on whiteboards, then distilled and circulated 
to participants and other stakeholders to refine and validate information. 
Additional engagement occurred through circulation of draft material and further 
discussions. This report distils the lessons for primary care practitioners to 
improve outcomes through management that is attentive to the needs of Aboriginal 
people.
RESULTS: Aspects of primordial, primary and secondary prevention are identified, 
with practical strategies for intervention summarised. The premature onset and 
high incidence of Aboriginal cardiovascular disease make prevention imperative 
and require that primary care practitioners understand and work to address the 
social underpinnings of poor health. Doctors are well placed to reinforce the 
importance of healthy lifestyle at all visits to involve the family and to 
reduce barriers which impede early care seeking. Ensuring better information for 
Aboriginal patients and better integrated care for patients who frequently have 
complex needs and multi-morbidities will also improve care outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Primary care practitioners have an important role in improving 
Aboriginal cardiovascular care outcomes. It is essential that they recognise the 
special needs of their Aboriginal patients and work at multiple levels both 
outside and inside the clinic for prevention and management of disease. A 
toolkit of proactive and holistic opportunities for interventions is proposed.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the cost effectiveness of community-based case management 
for patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: The study took place in the third largest municipality in Denmark and 
was conducted as a randomised controlled trial with 12 months of follow-up. A 
total of 150 patients with COPD were randomised into two groups receiving usual 
care and case management in addition to usual care. Case management included 
among other things self care proficiency, medicine compliance, and care 
coordination. Outcome measure for the analysis was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
from the perspective of the healthcare sector. Costs were valued in British 
Pounds (£) at price level 2016. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted in order to assess uncertainty of the ICER estimate.
RESULTS: The intervention resulted in a QALY improvement of 0.0146 (95% CI 
-0.0216; 0.0585), and a cost increase of £494 (95% CI -1778; 2766) per patient. 
No statistically significant difference was observed either in costs or effects. 
The ICER was £33,865 per QALY gained. Scenario analyses confirmed the robustness 
of the result and revealed slightly lower ICERs of £28,100-£31,340 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis revealed that case management led to a positive 
incremental QALY, but were more costly than usual care. The highly uncertain 
ICER somewhat exceeds for instance the threshold value used by the National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). No formally established Danish 
threshold value exists. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512836.

Background This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity and antitumor activity of single and multiple doses of nivolumab 
in Japanese patients with malignant solid tumors. Subjects and Methods This was 
an open-label, dose-escalation study in 17 patients with advanced solid tumors 
with a life expectancy of ≥3 months. Patients were observed for 3 weeks after a 
single dose of nivolumab at 1, 3, 10 or 20 mg/kg, then received the same dose of 
nivolumab every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression 
occurred. This study included a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg, which is the highest 
dose of nivolumab evaluated to date. The maximum dose was 10 mg/kg in previous 
studies. Results The commonest adverse drug reaction was lymphopenia, which 
occurred in 10 (58.8%) patients, including two (11.8%) with Grade ≥3 events. No 
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to the maximum dose of 
20 mg/kg. The area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last 
measurable concentration was linear up to 20 mg/kg. The maximum concentration 
showed dose-dependency up to 10 mg/kg, but not between 10 and 20 mg/kg. One 
durable complete response and two partial responses were observed. Conclusions 
Nivolumab at doses of 1-20 mg/kg was not associated with DLTs, and it was 
generally well tolerated at doses of up to 20 mg/kg in Japanese patients with 
advanced solid tumors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) monotherapies are 
typically used as the primary treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 
including lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (TBV), adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV) 
and tenofovir (TDF). For high-resistance NAs (LAM, TBV, ADV), they can generate 
excellent clinical outcomes by using response-guided therapy; however, their 
pharmacoeconomic profiles remain unclear in China. We aimed to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness between response-guided therapies and monotherapies of NAs for 
Chinese hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB patients.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate CHB progression associated 
with 12 treatment strategies using effectiveness and cost data from the 
published literature. We measured the lifetime costs, quality adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way 
sensitivity (especially to extend the range of the TDF price) and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were used to explore the uncertainties of the model.
RESULTS: For both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, no treatment strategy 
generated the lowest lifetime costs (US$31,185-US$31,338) and QALYs (7.54-7.58). 
ETV and TDF monotherapies were not dominated by other treatments, whereas, the 
ICER of ETV monotherapy was the lowest (US$6112/QALY-US$8533/QALY). For each 
high-resistance NA, compared with its monotherapy, the ICERs of its 
response-guided therapies were below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
US$22,833/QALY. Additionally, TDF monotherapy was the preferred treatment when 
its price dropped to US$1820/year or lower.
CONCLUSION: Among 12 treatment strategies evaluated, ETV monotherapy is the most 
cost-effective treatment for treatment-naive CHB patients in China. The 
response-guided therapies of high-resistance NAs are more cost-effective than 
their monotherapies.

BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ 4.0 Short Form 15 Generic 
Core Scales (hereafter the PedsQL) and the Child Health Utility-9 Dimensions 
(CHU9D) are two generic instruments designed to measure health-related quality 
of life in children and adolescents in the general population and paediatric 
patient groups living with specific health conditions. Although the PedsQL is 
widely used among paediatric patient populations, presently it is not possible 
to directly use the scores from the instrument to calculate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for application in economic evaluation because it produces 
summary scores which are not preference-based.
OBJECTIVE: This paper examines different econometric mapping techniques for 
estimating CHU9D utility scores from the PedsQL for the purpose of calculating 
QALYs for cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: The PedsQL and the CHU9D were completed by a community sample of 755 
Australian adolescents aged 15-17 years. Seven regression models were estimated: 
ordinary least squares estimator, generalised linear model, robust MM estimator, 
multivariate factorial polynomial estimator, beta-binomial estimator, finite 
mixture model and multinomial logistic model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and 
the mean squared error (MSE) were used to assess predictive ability of the 
models.
RESULTS: The MM estimator with stepwise-selected PedsQL dimension scores as 
explanatory variables had the best predictive accuracy using MAE and the 
equivalent beta-binomial model had the best predictive accuracy using MSE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our mapping algorithm facilitates the estimation of health-state 
utilities for use within economic evaluations where only PedsQL data is 
available and is suitable for use in community-based adolescents aged 15-17 
years. Applicability of the algorithm in younger populations should be assessed 
in further research.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
no prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis (PP), or secondary prophylaxis (SP) with 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), i.e., pegfilgrastim, 
lipegfilgrastim, filgrastim (6- and 11-day), or lenograstim (6- and 11-day), to 
reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with stage II 
breast cancer receiving TC (docetaxel, cyclophosphamide) and in patients with 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) over a lifetime horizon from a Belgian 
payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cycle tree tracked FN events during chemotherapy (3-week 
cycles) and long-term survival (1-year cycles). Model inputs, including the 
efficacy of each strategy, risk of reduced relative dose intensity (RDI), and 
the impact of RDI on mortality, utilities, and costs (in €; 2014 values) were 
estimated from public sources and the published literature. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were assessed for each strategy for costs per 
FN event avoided, life-year (LY) saved, and quality-adjusted LY (QALY) saved. 
LYs and QALYs saved were discounted at 1.5% annually. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSAs and PSAs) were conducted.
RESULTS: Base-case ICERs for PP with pegfilgrastim relative to SP with 
pegfilgrastim were €15,500 per QALY and €14,800 per LY saved for stage II breast 
cancer and €7800 per QALY and €6900 per LY saved for NHL; other comparators were 
either more expensive and less effective than PP or SP with pegfilgrastim or had 
lower costs but higher ICERs (relative to SP with pegfilgrastim) than PP with 
pegfilgrastim. Results of the DSA for breast cancer and NHL comparing PP and SP 
with pegfilgrastim indicate that the model results were most sensitive to the 
cycle 1 risk of FN, the proportion of FN events requiring hospitalization, the 
relative risk of FN in cycles ≥2 versus cycle 1, no history of FN, and the 
mortality hazard ratio for RDI (<90% vs ≥90% [for NHL]). In the PSAs for stage 
II breast cancer and NHL, the probabilities that PP with pegfilgrastim was cost 
effective or dominant versus all other prophylaxis strategies at a €30,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold were 52% (other strategies ≤24%) and 58% (other 
strategies ≤24%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: From a Belgian payer perspective, PP with pegfilgrastim appears cost 
effective compared to other prophylaxis strategies in patients with stage II 
breast cancer or NHL at a €30,000/QALY threshold.

Initial Management of Patients with HIV Infection.

Goldschmidt RH(1), Chu C(1), Dong BJ(1).

Author information:

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a treatable chronic 
disease with near-normal life expectancy when patients receive antiretroviral 
therapy (ART). Family physicians and other primary care clinicians commonly 
provide long-term comprehensive care for persons with HIV infection. This 
article describes the scope of initial care, including obtaining a thorough 
history; physical examination for HIV-associated manifestations; attention to 
HIV-specific immunization schedules; routine and HIV-specific laboratory 
evaluation; and ensuring standard health care maintenance to prevent HIV- and 
non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should encourage combination 
ART as early as possible, although careful assessment of patient readiness and 
ability to sustain lifelong treatment must be weighed. After ART initiation, 
monitoring viral load and CD4 lymphocyte response is essential to ensure viral 
suppression and evaluate immune system restoration. Opportunistic infections are 
now less common than in the past because ART usually prevents or markedly delays 
progression to advanced HIV disease. The most important reasons for consultation 
or comanagement with an HIV expert include management of antiretroviral drug 
resistance or drug toxicities, as well as special circumstances such as viral 
hepatitis coinfection or pregnancy.

Nutraceuticals are dietary compounds which have a role in the balance of 
anabolic and catabolic signals in joints. Their regulatory function on 
homeostasis of cartilage metabolism nutraceuticals is increasingly considered 
for the management and, above all, the prevention of osteoarthritis (OA). OA is 
a degenerative disease characterized by cartilage and synovium inflammation that 
can cause joint stiffness, swelling, pain, and loss of mobility. It is a 
multifactorial disease and, due to the great percentage of people suffering from 
it and the general increase in life expectancy, OA is considered as one of the 
most significant causes of disability in the world. OA impairs the structural 
integrity of articular cartilage that greatly depends on a balance between the 
anabolic and catabolic processes which occur in chondrocytes and synovial fluid 
of the joints, therefore the integration with nutraceutical compounds in diet 
increases the treatment options for patients with established OA beyond 
traditional rehabilitation, medications, and surgical strategies. In our review, 
with respect to the current literature, we highlight some of many existing 
nutraceutical compounds that could be used as integrators in a daily diet thanks 
to their easy availability, such as in olive oil, fish oil, and botanical 
extracts used as non-pharmacologic treatment.

Mortality in the United States, 2015.

Xu J, Murphy SL, Kochanek KD, Arias E.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2017 Jul 8;390(10090):102-104.

Data from the National Vital Statistics System, Mortality •Life expectancy for 
the U.S. population in 2015 was 78.8 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2014. 
•The age-adjusted death rate increased 1.2% from 724.6 deaths per 100,000 
standard population in 2014 to 733.1 in 2015. •The 10 leading causes of death in 
2015 remained the same as in 2014. Age-adjusted death rates increased for eight 
leading causes and decreased for one. •The infant mortality rate of 589.5 infant 
deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015 was not significantly different from the 
2014 rate. •The 10 leading causes of infant death in 2015 remained the same as 
in 2014, although two causes exchanged ranks. This report presents 2015 U.S. 
final mortality data on deaths and death rates by demographic and medical 
characteristics. These data provide information on mortality patterns among U.S. 
residents by variables such as sex, race and ethnicity, and cause of death. Life 
expectancy estimates, age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity and sex, 10 
leading causes of death, and 10 leading causes of infant death were analyzed by 
comparing 2015 and 2014 final data (1).

and Health Agency, Ulsan, South Korea.
(2)Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul National 
University, Seoul, South Korea.

PURPOSE: The research aim was to identify demographic characteristics, chronic 
diseases, and unhealthy behaviors predicting ill health retirement in South 
Korea.
METHODS: Data were collected from 15,407 individuals enrolled in the first 
through the fifth phases of the Korea Health Panel Survey (2008-2012) using 
structured questionnaires examining retirement, morbidities, and health-related 
behaviors. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine demographic and 
clinical characteristics' effects on ill health retirement. Lost years of 
working life expectancy were calculated for demographic and clinical 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Older, female, and manual workers were more likely to experience ill 
health retirement, as were respondents reporting poor health-related habits 
(e.g., heavy drinking, irregular meals, less sleep hours, obesity, and no 
regular exercise). The chronic diseases most closely associated with ill health 
retirement were, in order, psychiatric disease, ophthalmologic disease, 
neurologic disease, infectious disease, and musculoskeletal diseases. The 
average reduction in working life expectancy was 9.73 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results can help contribute to the development of 
strategies for reducing the risk of ill health retirement and promoting 
sustainable labor force participation in an aging society.

Unit, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) constitute a rare group of 
inherited connective tissue diseases, characterized by multisystemic 
manifestations and general tissue fragility. Most severe complications include 
vascular and gastrointestinal (GI) emergencies requiring acute surgery. The 
purpose of this systematic review was to assess the causes of GI-related surgery 
and related mortality and morbidity in patients with EDSs.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to 
identify relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. According to 
eligibility criteria, data were extracted and systematically screened by 2 
authors.
RESULTS: Screening process identified 11 studies with a total of 1,567 patients. 
Findings indicated that patients with EDSs had a higher occurrence of surgery 
demanding GI manifestations, including perforation, hemorrhage, rupture of 
intra-abdominal organs, and rectal prolapse. Most affected was the vascular 
subtype, of which up to 33% underwent GI surgery and suffered from a lowered 
average life expectancy of 48 years (range 6-78). Secondary complications of 
surgery were common in all patients with EDSs.
CONCLUSION: Studies suggested that patients with EDSs present an increased need 
for GI surgery, but also an increased risk of surgery-related complications, 
most predominantly seen in the vascular subtype.
