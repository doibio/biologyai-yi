BACKGROUND: Lymph node transfer (LNT) and lymphovenous bypass (LVB) have been 
described as 2 major surgical options for patients with breast cancer-related 
lymphedema (BCRL) who have failed conservative therapy. The objective of our 
study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing LNT and LVB for the 
treatment of BCRL.
STUDY DESIGN: Rates of infection, lymph leak, and failure of LNT and LVB were 
obtained from a previously published meta-analysis. Failure of surgery was 
defined as the inability to cease compression therapy postoperatively. 
Procedural costs were calculated from Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost of 
conservative management of postoperative surgical site infection, lymph leak, 
and continued decongestive physiotherapy after failed surgery were obtained from 
literature review. Average utility scores for each health state were calculated 
using a visual analog scale survey, then converted to quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). A decision tree was constructed, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was assessed at $50,000/QALY. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of 
our findings.
RESULTS: LNT was less costly ($22,492 vs $31,927) and more effective (31.82 QALY 
vs 29.24 QALY) than LVB. One-way (deterministic) sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that LNT became cost-ineffective when its failure rate was more 
than 43.8%. LVB became more cost-effective than LNT when its failure rate was 
less than 21.4%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation 
indicated that even with uncertainty present in the variables analyzed, the 
majority of simulations (97%) favored LNT as the more cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: LNT is a dominant, cost-effective strategy compared to LVB for the 
treatment of BCRL.

Chemotherapeutic drugs kill cancer cells or control their progression all over 
the patient's body, while radiation- and surgery-based treatments perform in a 
particular site. Based on their mechanisms of action, they are classified into 
different groups, including alkylating substrates, antimetabolite agents, 
anti-tumor antibiotics, inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II, mitotic 
inhibitors, and finally, corticosteroids. Although chemotherapeutic drugs have 
brought about more life expectancy, two major and severe complications during 
chemotherapy are chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Therefore, we aimed to 
review the underlying intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell death 
and resistance in different chemotherapeutic drug families to clarify the 
shortcomings in the conventional single chemotherapy applications. Moreover, we 
have summarized the current combination chemotherapy applications, including 
numerous combined-, and encapsulated-combined-chemotherapeutic drugs. We further 
discussed the possibilities and applications of precision medicine, machine 
learning, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 
promoting cancer immunotherapies. Finally, some of the recent clinical trials 
concerning the application of immunotherapies and combination chemotherapies 
were included as well, in order to provide a practical perspective toward the 
future of therapies in cancer cases.

Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased HIV-related morbidity and 
mortality and increased life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). 
Globally, the number of older PLHIV (OPLHIV; ≥50 years) is growing and predicted 
to increase substantially in coming years. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the 
majority of OPLHIV reside, there are limited data on the health and well-being 
of OPLHIV.Methods: We conducted an exploratory descriptive study that included 
structured interviews with 50 OPLHIV receiving ART at an outpatient HIV clinic 
in Eswatini and in-depth qualitative interviews (IDIs) with a sub-set of ten 
participants to elicit their experiences of living with HIV as an older adult, 
including quality of life, physical health, and mental health. Quantitative 
analyses were performed to obtain both descriptive statistics and 
cross-tabulations. A thematic analysis of IDI narratives was conducted based on 
three levels of the socio-ecological model to identify sub-themes and response 
patterns.Results: All study participants were virally suppressed. Self-reported 
non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors and markers were common, with 40% (n 
= 20) reporting being current or former smokers, 0% consuming the recommended 
servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and 57% (n = 28 of 49 reporting 
screening) reporting having hypertension. However, the majority (88%; 44 of 50) 
had sufficient physical activity; most of the activity was in the work domain. 
Slightly more than one-third (38%; 13 of 34 tested) had a high random blood 
sugar level. Barriers to living with HIV were primarily structural (food 
insecurity, unemployment, access to transportation and health care).Conclusions: 
OPLHIV should be screened for NCDs, and services for NCDs should ideally be 
integrated with HIV services. While all participants had controlled HIV, this 
study highlights the need for strategies that facilitate OPLHIV's HIV service 
utilisation. With the increasing numbers of OPLHIV, these issues cannot be 
ignored.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of 
cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to 
determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of 
socioeconomic status on this health burden.
METHODS: National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with 
cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report 
was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR 
exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
RESULTS: Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated 
with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% 
lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 
0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 
76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion 
was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction 
analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association 
between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for 
interaction = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor 
socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings 
emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in 
developing countries with high-UVR exposure.

Fc-less bispecific T-cell engagers have reached the immuno-oncology market but 
necessitate continual infusion due to rapid clearance from the circulation. This 
work introduces a programmable serum half-life extension platform based on 
fusion of human albumin sequences engineered with either null (NB), wild type 
(WT) or high binding (HB) FcRn affinity combined with a bispecific T-cell 
engager. We demonstrate in a humanised FcRn/albumin double transgenic mouse 
model (AlbuMus) the ability to tune half-life based on the albumin sequence 
fused with a BiTE-like bispecific (anti-EGFR nanobody x anti-CD3 scFv) light 
T-cell engager (LiTE) construct [(t½ 0.6 h (Fc-less LiTE), t½ 19 hours 
(Albu-LiTE-NB), t½ 26 hours (Albu-LiTE-WT), t½ 37 hours (Albu-LiTE-HB)]. We show 
in vitro cognate target engagement, T-cell activation and discrimination in 
cellular cytotoxicity dependent on EGFR expression levels. Furthermore, greater 
growth inhibition of EGFR-positive BRAF mutated tumours was measured following a 
single dose of Albu-LiTE-HB construct compared to the Fc-less LiTE format and a 
full-length anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in a new AlbuMus RAG1 knockout model 
introduced in this work. Programmable half-life extension facilitated by this 
albumin platform potentially offers long-lasting effects, better patient 
compliance and a method to tailor pharmacokinetics to maximise therapeutic 
efficacy and safety of immuno-oncology targeted biologics.

AIMS: To estimate the health and economic burden of new and established 
cardiovascular disease from 2020 to 2029 in Australia.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-stage multistate dynamic model was developed to 
predict the burden of the incident and prevalent cardiovascular disease, for 
Australians 40-90 years old from 2020 to 2029. The model captured morbidity, 
mortality, years of life lived, quality-adjusted life years, healthcare costs, 
and productivity losses. Cardiovascular risk for the primary prevention 
population was derived using Australian demographic data and the Pooled Cohort 
Equation. Risk for the secondary prevention population was derived from the 
REACH registry. Input data for costs and utilities were extracted from published 
sources. All outcomes were annually discounted by 5%. A number of sensitivity 
analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the study. Between 2020 and 
2029, the model estimates 377 754 fatal and 991 375 non-fatal cardiovascular 
events. By 2029, 1 061 756 Australians will have prevalent cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). The population accrued 8 815 271 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
8 805 083-8 841 432] years of life lived with CVD and 5 876 975 
(5 551 484-6 226 045) QALYs. The total healthcare costs of CVD were projected to 
exceed Australian dollars (AUD) 61.89 (61.79-88.66) billion, and productivity 
losses will account for AUD 78.75 (49.40-295.25) billion, driving the total cost 
to surpass AUD 140.65 (123.13-370.23) billion.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular disease in Australia has substantial impacts in terms 
of morbidity, mortality, and lost revenue to the healthcare system and the 
society. Our modelling provides important information for decision making in 
relation to the future burden of cardiovascular disease.

The global human population has recently experienced an increase in life 
expectancy with a mounting concern about the steady rise in the incidence of 
age-associated chronic diseases and socio-economic burden. Calorie restriction 
(CR), the reduction of energy intake without malnutrition, is a dietary 
manipulation that can increase health and longevity in most model organisms. 
However, the practice of CR in day-to-day life is a challenging long-term goal 
for human intervention. Recently, daily fasting length and periodicity have 
emerged as potential drivers behind CR's beneficial health effects. Numerous 
strategies and eating patterns have been successfully developed to recapitulate 
many of CR's benefits without its austerity. These novel feeding protocols range 
from shortened meal timing designed to interact with our circadian system (e.g., 
daily time-restricted feeding) to more extended fasting regimens known as 
intermittent fasting. Here, we provide a glimpse of the current status of 
knowledge on different strategies to reap the benefits of CR on metabolic health 
in murine models and in humans, without the rigor of continuous reduction in 
caloric intake as presented at the USU State of the Science Symposium.

BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for multiple myeloma requires several 
regimens of treatment, with patients experiencing high symptom burden and side 
effects, which negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Thus, 
it is crucial to understand patient perceptions of multiple myeloma and how 
patients value different treatment options.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory investigation 
into concepts that could form attributes that influence treatment choices for 
patients with multiple myeloma and to identify trade-offs that patients are 
willing to make between treatment attributes.
METHODS: In total, 30 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma from the UK, France, and Germany participated in semistructured 
interviews talking about their disease experience and symptoms, treatment 
benefits, treatment burden, perceived side effects, and benefit/risk trade-offs 
in treatment. The interview audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using 
content analysis to identify treatment and disease aspects relevant to patients.
RESULTS: Symptoms of fatigue and bone pain and treatment side effects of 
peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, and constipation were cited by patients as the 
most disruptive to their HRQoL. Treatment duration was reported most frequently 
as a major treatment burden, and patients emphasized the importance of increased 
life expectancy as a treatment benefit. All patients showed good understanding 
of benefit/risk trade-offs in treatment, and some patients expressed a 
preference for more convenient modes of treatment administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative interviews identified key aspects of multiple myeloma 
treatment that are most important to patients. These findings will inform a 
wider patient-preferences study, which could improve treatment choice and HRQoL 
for patients with multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: Molecularly targeted therapies have revolutionized non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Many patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving targeted 
therapy may live several years with incurable cancer. We sought to describe how 
these metastatic cancer survivors and their caregivers experience uncertainty 
about the future and identify their unmet supportive care needs.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with metastatic 
NSCLC receiving targeted therapy (n = 39) and their caregivers (n = 16). We used 
a framework approach to code and analyze the qualitative data.
RESULTS: Metastatic lung cancer survivors described awareness of their mortality 
and the possibility that their cancer could progress at any time. Though some 
found ways to cope, many felt inadequately supported to manage their distress, 
especially since they were "doing fine medically." Survivors struggled with 
decisions about working and managing their finances given their uncertain life 
expectancy and sought trustworthy lung cancer information in plain language. 
They wished to compare experiences with other patients with their molecular 
subtype of NSCLC. Participants desired comprehensive cancer care that includes 
psychosocial support, preparation for the future, and ways to promote their own 
health, such as through lifestyle changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving targeted therapy and their 
caregivers experience distress related to living with uncertainty and desire 
more coping support, connection with peers, information, and healthy lifestyle 
guidance.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patients living with treatable yet incurable 
cancer and their caregivers are a growing population of cancer survivors. 
Recognition of their unmet needs may inform the development of tailored support 
services to help them live well with cancer.

Cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocelluar carcinoma, the most common primary liver cancer, has a 
historically dire prognosis. For hepatic cancer patients with cirrhosis who 
underwent liver transplantation, we sought to calculate life expectancies both 
at time of transplant and several years later, stratified by some key variables, 
and to determine if survival has improved in recent years.
METHODS: Data on 13,797 hepatic cancer patients with cirrhosis who underwent 
liver transplantation in the MELD era (2002-2018) from the US Organ Procurement 
and Transplantation Network database were analyzed using the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model and life table methods.
RESULTS: The major factors related to survival were age, donor age, transplant 
year, diabetes, functional status, and the presence of severe hepatic 
encephalopathy. Survival was significantly worse with increasing age and 
decreasing functional status level. There was no significant difference in 
survival between males and females. Survival improved over the study period, at 
5% per calendar year during the first 5 years post transplant, and 1% per year 
thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancies were markedly reduced from normal, even among 
5-year survivors with the most favorable characteristics. Survival improved 
modestly over the years 2002-2018.

Continuous and advanced treatment strategies in old and very old patients with 
Parkinson's disease.

cerveau, ICM, Inserm, CNRS Neurology Department, Pitié-Salpêtrière University 
Hospital, Paris, France.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an incidence and a 
prevalence increasing with age, predicted to increase drastically in the next 10 
years among the geriatric population aged above 80 in France. There are two 
distinct groups of patients in which therapeutic issues are different. On the 
one hand, old to very old patients in which PD started at a late age above 80. 
These patients present with a more severe PD with earlier onsets of cognitive 
defects and dopa-resistant axial signs, and more comorbidities which need to be 
taken into account while treating them. Because of their limited life 
expectancy, these patients would not likely need second-line treatments over 
their disease course. On the other hand, patients presenting with advanced PD, 
in which fluctuations and dyskinesia induced by dopamine replacement therapy and 
dopa-resistant axial symptoms impede patient's daily life. These patients are 
often treated with multiple anti-Parkinsonian medications, sometimes at high 
doses. Some patients will also be treated with advanced therapies such as 
continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, continuous levodopacarbidopa 
intestinal gel or, more rarely, even subthalamic or pallidal deep brain 
stimulations. Because of the specificities of the old to very old Parkinsonian 
patients, tolerance and efficacy of these treatments can be decreased. What is 
at stake is to aim for the best motor state possible while limiting iatrogenic 
adverse events. New emerging, potentially less invasive, techniques, such as 
gamma knife thalamotomy or high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy or 
sub-thalamotomy, are also discussed here.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate outcomes and survival rates in patients with metastatic 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) who were treated with image-guided locoregional 
treatments (IGLTs).
PURPOSE: To evaluate the overall survival (OS) and clinical impact of IGLT in 
the management of patients with advanced metastatic ACC.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 39 patients treated with IGLT between 1999 and 
2018 was performed. Short- and long-term efficacy of treatments were defined 
based upon imaging and clinical data. Subgroup survival analysis was performed 
on patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis (N = 17) and compared with the 
same stage group from the most recent National Cancer Database (NCDB) report. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Treatments were performed at different anatomic sites including liver 
(N = 46), lung (N = 14), retroperitoneum (N = 5), bone (N = 4), subcutaneous 
(N = 2), and intracaval (N = 1). Radiofrequency, microwave, cryoablation, or a 
combination of two modalities (45, 18, 3, 3, respectively) were used in 69 
ablation sessions. Intra-arterial procedures were performed in 12 patients in 18 
treatment cycles (range 1-3 per patient). As of a 2019 analysis, 11 patients 
were alive with a mean follow-up of 169 months (range 63-292 months) from 
diagnosis. Two- and 5-year OS rates for all patients were 84.5% and 51%, 
respectively, and 76.5% and 59% for patients with metastatic disease at 
diagnosis (N = 17). This compares favorably with an NCDB report of 35% 5-year 
survival rate for patients with metastatic disease. Female gender and longer 
time from diagnosis to first IGLT were found to be predictors of prolonged 
survival with hazard ratios of 0.23 (p < 0.001) and 0.66 (p = 0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: IGLT may be associated with prolonged life expectancy in select 
patients with metastatic ACC.

IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on screening for lung cancer with low-dose 
computed tomography (LDCT) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF).
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2019; 
references; experts; and literature surveillance through November 20, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies of screening with LDCT, accuracy of 
LDCT, risk prediction models, or treatment for early-stage lung cancer.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and 
study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Data were not pooled because 
of heterogeneity of populations and screening protocols.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality, 
all-cause mortality, test accuracy, and harms.
RESULTS: This review included 223 publications. Seven randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs) (N = 86 486) evaluated lung cancer screening with LDCT; the National Lung 
Screening Trial (NLST, N = 53 454) and Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings 
Onderzoek (NELSON, N = 15 792) were the largest RCTs. Participants were more 
likely to benefit than the US screening-eligible population (eg, based on life 
expectancy). The NLST found a reduction in lung cancer mortality (incidence rate 
ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]; number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent 
1 lung cancer death, 323 over 6.5 years of follow-up) with 3 rounds of annual 
LDCT screening compared with chest radiograph for high-risk current and former 
smokers aged 55 to 74 years. NELSON found a reduction in lung cancer mortality 
(IRR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.90]; NNS to prevent 1 lung cancer death of 130 over 
10 years of follow-up) with 4 rounds of LDCT screening with increasing intervals 
compared with no screening for high-risk current and former smokers aged 50 to 
74 years. Harms of screening included radiation-induced cancer, false-positive 
results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, 
incidental findings, and increases in distress. For every 1000 persons screened 
in the NLST, false-positive results led to 17 invasive procedures (number needed 
to harm, 59) and fewer than 1 person having a major complication. Overdiagnosis 
estimates varied greatly (0%-67% chance that a lung cancer was overdiagnosed). 
Incidental findings were common, and estimates varied widely (4.4%-40.7% of 
persons screened).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening high-risk persons with LDCT can reduce lung 
cancer mortality but also causes false-positive results leading to unnecessary 
tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, incidental findings, increases in 
distress, and, rarely, radiation-induced cancers. Most studies reviewed did not 
use current nodule evaluation protocols, which might reduce false-positive 
results and invasive procedures for false-positive results.

Summary for patients in
    JAMA. 2021 Mar 9;325(10):1016.

IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause 
of cancer death in the US. In 2020, an estimated 228 820 persons were diagnosed 
with lung cancer, and 135 720 persons died of the disease. The most important 
risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. Increasing age is also a risk factor for 
lung cancer. Lung cancer has a generally poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year 
survival rate of 20.5%. However, early-stage lung cancer has a better prognosis 
and is more amenable to treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To update its 2013 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the accuracy of screening for 
lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and on the benefits and 
harms of screening for lung cancer and commissioned a collaborative modeling 
study to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end 
screening, the optimal screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms 
of different screening strategies compared with modified versions of 
multivariate risk prediction models.
POPULATION: This recommendation statement applies to adults aged 50 to 80 years 
who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within 
the past 15 years.
EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual 
screening for lung cancer with LDCT has a moderate net benefit in persons at 
high risk of lung cancer based on age, total cumulative exposure to tobacco 
smoke, and years since quitting smoking.
RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT 
in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and 
currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be 
discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health 
problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness 
to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation) This recommendation replaces 
the 2013 USPSTF statement that recommended annual screening for lung cancer with 
LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and 
currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

AIMS: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used for primary or 
secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. We sought to clarify prognosis and 
causes of death after ICD implantation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2743 patients with ICDs implanted during 
1990-2020 were analyzed. Median age was 68.5 (59.6-74.6) years; 21% women, 
median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 30 (23-35), 52% had an 
ischemic etiology and 77% had a primary preventive indication. Mortality rate 
after 10 years was 22, 44, 55, and 72% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th age 
quartile, respectively. The calculated median sex and age adjusted loss of life 
years compared to the average German population was 9.7 (6.1-14.0) years. 
Prognosis was independently related to sex, age, LVEF, and glomerular filtration 
rate. 713 out of 852 deaths could be classified to a specific cause. Congestive 
heart failure (CHF) accounted for death in 214 (30%) and sudden death (SD) for 
144 patients (20%). Postmortem interrogation of devices in 74 patients revealed 
VT/VF in 39 and no episodes in 35 patients. Cancer was identified as the cause 
of death in 121 patients (17% of cases), of which 36 were bronchial carcinomas. 
73 (10%) of patients died due to infection. 67 patients (9%) died within 24 h of 
procedures. Compared to other causes, significantly more life years were lost 
associated with procedures and SD: 9.3 (5.7-12.9) versus 12.1 (7.4-15.2) and 
11.9 (7.6-17.8) years.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy of ICD patients is lower than for the general 
population. Mortality is predominantly due to CHF, but there is still a 
considerable rate of SD. The occurrence of cancers, most importantly bronchial 
carcinomas, and infections, warrants protective measures. Some deaths during 
procedures are possibly preventable. Patients with ICDs comprise a vulnerable 
cohort, and treatment has to be optimized in many directions to improve 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 
approximately 95% of all diabetes cases and is associated with a substantially 
elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is 2- to 4-times higher in 
patients with T2DM compared to those without. The aim of present study was to 
evaluate the cost effectiveness of empagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin for 
the treatment of patients with T2DM and established CVD in Greece.
METHODS: A published health economic model was used to project clinical and 
economic outcomes of T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin compared to those 
receiving dapagliflozin. Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was 
conducted to predict time-to-event for CV, renal, and adverse events over 
patients' lifetimes. Hazard ratios for dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on 
each clinical event was estimated from DECLARE-TIMI 58 and EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trials' data using an indirect treatment comparison. Following a public payer 
perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, 
fatal/non-fatal diabetes-related complications and adverse events were 
considered (€2020). Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LY), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs as well as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of 
changes in input data.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was associated with longer 
mean survival (17.23 LY with empagliflozin vs 16.07 LY with dapagliflozin) and 
reduced rate of CV mortality resulting in 0.48 more QALYs (9.27 vs 8.79), at 
additional costs of €462. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €965 per QALY 
gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's 
cost-effective profile. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the 
probability of empagliflozin being cost effective over dapagliflozin was 100%, 
at the defined threshold of €36,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin was estimated to be a highly cost-effective treatment 
option compared to dapagliflozin for the treatment of T2DM patients with 
established CVD in Greece.

Value assessment frameworks: who is valuing the care in healthcare?

Michaels JA(1).

Author information:

Health and Related Research, Sheffield, UK j.michaels@sheffield.ac.uk.

Many healthcare agencies are producing evidence-based guidance and policy that 
may determine the availability of particular healthcare products and procedures, 
effectively rationing aspects of healthcare. They claim legitimacy for their 
decisions through reference to evidence-based scientific method and the 
implementation of just decision-making procedures, often citing the criteria of 
'accountability for reasonableness'; publicity, relevance, challenge and 
revision, and regulation. Central to most decision methods are estimates of 
gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), a measure that combines the length 
and quality of survival. However, all agree that the QALY alone is not a 
sufficient measure of all relevant aspects of potential healthcare benefits, and 
a number of value assessment frameworks have been suggested. I argue that the 
practical implementation of these procedures has the potential to lead to a 
distorted assessment of value. Undue weight may be ascribed to certain 
attributes, particularly those that favour commercial or political interests, 
while other attributes that are highly valued by society, particularly those 
related to care processes, may be omitted or undervalued. This may be compounded 
by a lack of transparency to relevant stakeholders, resulting in an inability 
for them to participate in, or challenge, the decisions. The makes it likely 
that costly new technologies, for which inflated prices can be justified by the 
current value frameworks, are displacing aspects of healthcare that are highly 
valued by society.

BACKGROUND: Bulbar involvement is a term used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) that refers to motor neuron impairment in the corticobulbar area of the 
brainstem, which produces a dysfunction of speech and swallowing. One of the 
earliest symptoms of bulbar involvement is voice deterioration characterized by 
grossly defective articulation; extremely slow, laborious speech; marked 
hypernasality; and severe harshness. Bulbar involvement requires well-timed and 
carefully coordinated interventions. Therefore, early detection is crucial to 
improving the quality of life and lengthening the life expectancy of patients 
with ALS who present with this dysfunction. Recent research efforts have focused 
on voice analysis to capture bulbar involvement.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper was (1) to design a methodology for 
diagnosing bulbar involvement efficiently through the acoustic parameters of 
uttered vowels in Spanish, and (2) to demonstrate that the performance of the 
automated diagnosis of bulbar involvement is superior to human diagnosis.
METHODS: The study focused on the extraction of features from the phonatory 
subsystem-jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and pitch-from the 
utterance of the five Spanish vowels. Then, we used various supervised 
classification algorithms, preceded by principal component analysis of the 
features obtained.
RESULTS: To date, support vector machines have performed better (accuracy 95.8%) 
than the models analyzed in the related work. We also show how the model can 
improve human diagnosis, which can often misdiagnose bulbar involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained are very encouraging and demonstrate the 
efficiency and applicability of the automated model presented in this paper. It 
may be an appropriate tool to help in the diagnosis of ALS by multidisciplinary 
clinical teams, in particular to improve the diagnosis of bulbar involvement.

BACKGROUND: Bile duct injury (BDI) is a severe complication following 
cholecystectomy. Early recognition and treatment of BDI has been shown to reduce 
costs and improve patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess 
the effect and cost-effectiveness of routine versus selective intraoperative 
cholangiography (IOC) in cholecystectomy.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis, combined with a health economic 
model analysis in the Swedish setting, was performed. Costs per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) for routine versus selective IOC during cholecystectomy for 
different scenarios were calculated.
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, eight studies with more than 2 million patients 
subjected to cholecystectomy and 9000 BDIs were included. The rate of BDI was 
estimated to 0.36 per cent when IOC was performed routinely, compared with to 
0.53 per cent when used selectively, indicating an increased risk for BDI of 43 
per cent when IOC was used selectively (odds ratio 1.43, 95 per cent c.i. 1.22 
to 1.67). The model analysis estimated that seven injuries were avoided annually 
by routine IOC in Sweden, a population of 10 million. Over a 10-year period, 33 
QALYs would be gained at an approximate net cost of €808 000 , at a cost per 
QALY of about €24 900.
CONCLUSION: Routine IOC during cholecystectomy reduces the risk of BDI compared 
with the selective strategy and is a potentially cost-effective intervention.

ANTECEDENTES: La lesión de la vía biliar (bile duct injury, BDI) es una 
complicación grave de la colecistectomía. Se ha demostrado que la detección y el 
tratamiento precoz de la BDI reducen los costes y mejoran la calidad de vida del 
paciente (quality-of-life, QoL). El objetivo del estudio fue evaluar el efecto y 
el coste-beneficio de la colangiografía intraoperatoria (intraoperative 
cholangiography, IOC) de rutina versus la IOC selectiva durante la 
colecistectomía.
MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática y un metaanálisis combinados con un 
análisis del modelo económico de salud en el entorno sueco. Se calculó el coste 
por año de vida ajustado por calidad (quality-adjusted life-year, QALY) para la
