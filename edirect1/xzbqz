Currently, there is a great need for education and awareness in the medical 
field regarding TSC. The disease is often overlooked, misdiagnosed, or 
mismanaged. Patients can be given misleading information, which may lead to 
unnecessary procedures and distress. Moreover, with the correct management, 
patients with TSC have a normal life expectancy and preserved renal function.

[Treatment of main chronic diseases in childhood from birth].

[Article in French]

Casimir G.

Children suffering from chronic diseases are very quickly diagnosed by neonatal 
screening and follow-up of the mother during the pregnancy. Early screening and 
diagnosis are essential to obtain continuous improvement of the prognosis in 
term of treatment and psychosocial outcome. Multidisciplinary teams are now well 
organized to treat all the complications of the disease. Registers at national 
and international levels allow professionals to compare themselves and to 
evaluate the improvement of clinical status and mid-life expectancy.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancers are the leaders in their prevalence 
and the major causes of death in economically developed countries, determining 
their high sociomedical significance in society. Improvement of methods for the 
early diagnosis and treatment of cancers has contributed to increases in 
relapse-free survival and life expectancy in these patients. At the same time, 
the new problems have emerged particularly in the development of various 
cardiovascular events/diseases when treating cancer, which may predict worse 
prognosis in patients and be an independent cause of death. To search for new 
markers of cardiotoxicity at early stages and to develop effective methods for 
the prevention and personalized treatment of cancer and CVD are the problems 
that can be solved only by joint efforts of cardiologists and oncologists.

U.S. health care from a global perspective: spending, use of services, prices, 
and health in 13 countries.

Squires D(1), Anderson C.

Author information:
(1)The Commonwealth Fund. ds@cmwf.org

This analysis draws upon data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development and other cross-national analyses to compare health care spending, 
supply, utilization, prices, and health outcomes across 13 high-income 
countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
These data predate the major insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In 
2013, the U.S. spent far more on health care than these other countries. Higher 
spending appeared to be largely driven by greater use of medical technology and 
higher health care prices, rather than more frequent doctor visits or hospital 
admissions. In contrast, U.S. spending on social services made up a relatively 
small share of the economy relative to other countries. Despite spending more on 
health care, Americans had poor health outcomes, including shorter life 
expectancy and greater prevalence of chronic conditions.

Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically changed the 
life expectancy of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients. Although the impact 
of first-generation TKIs on quality of life (QoL) was shown in CML, the effects 
of new generic formulations of imatinib mesylate (IM) are unclear. We evaluated 
differences in QoL under treatment with first- or second-generation TKIs. 
Fifty-two patients diagnosed with CP-CML completed the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionaire-C30, Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale, and General Health Questionnaire. General QoL 
scores were similar between groups. There was a significant difference in the 
frequency of diarrhoea between IM group and the group using new generic 
formulations of IM (P = 0.012). General QoL score tended to be higher in 
patients with disease duration longer than 3 years (P = 0.052). GHQ, anxiety and 
depression scores correlated positively with symptom scales and negatively with 
functional subscales.CML patients using new generic formulations of IM reported 
a higher frequency of diarrhoea than patients using original IM and 
second-generation TKIs that could result in more drug discontinuation.

Competing Demands from Aging Parents and Adult Children in Two Cohorts of 
American Women.

In late middle age, individuals may face competing demands on their time and 
financial resources from elderly parents and young adult children. This study 
uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine changes over time in the 
probability of having children and living parents for women age 45 to 64. We 
compare two cohorts: those born in the 1920s and 1930s and those born in the 
1940s and 1950s. We find that there has been a dramatic increase in the 
probability of having children and living parents and that this increase has 
been driven mainly by changes in life expectancy of the parent generation. We 
further examine transfers of money and co-residence for women in the later 
cohort. We find that while women may not give to parents and children 
concurrently, approximately thirty percent of them have provided support to both 
parents and children at some point in the past.

INTRODUCTION: The search for consistent, effective treatments in Parkinson's 
disease (PD) is ongoing. The importance of continuous dopaminergic stimulation 
(CDS) is understood to underlie best medical therapy for PD by providing closer 
replication of physiological patterns of dopamine release in healthy brains.
AREAS COVERED: An overview of interventions to improve motor fluctuations in PD 
is presented. Significant improvements in off-time are achieved by providing 
continuous therapy using targeted deep brain stimulation (DBS), subcutaneous 
apomorphine infusion and carbidopa/levodopa enteral suspension (Duopa). Duopa is 
a newly approved treatment in the US for advanced PD that delivers levodopa 
pumped to the intestinal tract through a percutaneous gastrostomy with jejunum 
tube extension (PEG-J tube). Trials with carbidopa/levodopa enteral suspension 
show improvement in motor fluctuations, reduction in plasma levodopa variation 
and improvement in overall "on" time compared with oral immediate release 
formulation of carbidopa/levodopa.
EXPERT OPINION: The degree of improvement in number of off hours per day on 
carbidopa/levodopa enteral suspension infusion rivals that seen with DBS and 
apomorphine infusion and makes this new treatment a valuable option in advanced 
fluctuating PD patients, especially those who are neither candidates for DBS or 
who do not have access to apomorphine infusion therapy or who have failed either 
or both therapies.

Prevention of Hepatitis C by Screening and Treatment in U.S. Prisons.

He T, Li K, Roberts MS, Spaulding AC, Ayer T, Grefenstette JJ, Chhatwal J.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in U.S. prisoners is high; 
however, HCV testing and treatment are rare. Infected inmates released back into 
society contribute to the spread of HCV in the general population. Routine 
hepatitis screening of inmates followed by new therapies may reduce ongoing HCV 
transmission.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health and economic effect of HCV screening and 
treatment in prisons on the HCV epidemic in society.
DESIGN: Agent-based microsimulation model of HCV transmission and progression of 
HCV disease.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Population in U.S. prisons and general community.
TIME HORIZON: 30 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Risk-based and universal opt-out hepatitis C screening in 
prisons, followed by treatment in a portion of patients.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevention of HCV transmission and associated disease in 
prisons and society, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and total prison budget.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Implementing risk-based and opt-out screening 
could diagnose 41,900 to 122,700 new HCV cases in prisons in the next 30 years. 
Compared with no screening, these scenarios could prevent 5500 to 12,700 new HCV 
infections caused by released inmates, wherein about 90% of averted infections 
would have occurred outside of prisons. Screening could also prevent 4200 to 
11,700 liver-related deaths. The ICERs of screening scenarios were $19,600 to 
$29,200 per QALY, and the respective first-year prison budget was $900 to $1150 
million. Prisons would require an additional 12.4% of their current health care 
budget to implement such interventions.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the time horizon, and 
ICERs otherwise remained less than $50,000 per QALY.
LIMITATION: Data on transmission network, reinfection rate, and opt-out HCV 
screening rate are lacking.
CONCLUSION: Universal opt-out HCV screening in prisons is highly cost-effective 
and would reduce HCV transmission and HCV-associated diseases primarily in the 
outside community. Investing in U.S. prisons to manage hepatitis C is a 
strategic approach to address the current epidemic.

IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are highly 
efficacious but costly. Thus, many insurers cover therapy only in advanced 
fibrosis stages. The added health benefits and costs of early treatment are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating all patients with 
HCV vs only those with advanced fibrosis and (2) treating each stage of 
fibrosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a decision-analytic model for 
the treatment of HCV genotype 1. The model used a lifetime horizon and societal 
perspective and was representative of all US patients with HCV genotype 1 who 
had not received previous treatment. Comparisons in the model included antiviral 
treatment of all fibrosis stages (METAVIR [Meta-analysis of Histological Data in 
Virial Hepatitis] stages F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [cirrhosis]) vs treatment of 
stages F3 (numerous septa without cirrhosis) and F4 only and by specific 
fibrosis stage. Data were collected from March 1 to September 1, 2014, and 
analyzed from September 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS: Six HCV therapy options (particularly combined sofosbuvir and 
ledipasvir therapy) or no treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost and health outcomes were measured using total 
medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), calculated as the difference in costs between 
strategies divided by the difference in QALYs.
RESULTS: We simulated 1000 individuals, but present the results normalized to a 
single HCV-infected person. In the base-case analysis, among patients receiving 
8 or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir treatment, treating all fibrosis stages 
compared with treating stages F3 and F4 adds 0.73 QALYs and $28,899, for an ICER 
of $39,475 per QALY gained. Treating at stage F2 (portal fibrosis with rare 
septa) costs $19,833 per QALY gained vs waiting until stage F3; treating at 
stage F1 (portal fibrosis without septa), $81,165 per QALY gained compared with 
waiting until stage F2; and treating at stage F0, $187,065 per QALY gained 
compared with waiting until stage F1. Results for other regimens show a similar 
pattern. At base-case drug prices, treating 50% of all eligible US patients with 
HCV genotype 1 would cost $53 billion. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER for 
treating all stages vs treating stages F3 and F4 was most sensitive to cohort 
age, drug costs, utility values in stages F1 and F2, and percentage of patients 
eligible for 8-week therapy. Except for patients aged 70 years, the ICER remains 
less than $100,000 per QALY gained. A 46% reduction in cost of 
sofosbuvir-ledipasvir therapy decreases the ICER for treating at all fibrosis 
stages by 48%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulated model, treating HCV infection at 
early stages of fibrosis appeared to improve health outcomes and to be 
cost-effective but incurred substantial aggregate costs. The findings may have 
implications for health care coverage policies and clinical decision making.

[POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH EXTENSIVE MALIGNANT 
CHEST WALL NEOPLASMS].

[Article in Russian]

Larin IA, Tarasov VA, Khubulava GG, Gavrilov EK.

The authors consider possibilities for the surgical treatment of patients with 
extensive malignant chest wall neoplasms. It is argued that combinedsugical 
interventions and resection of the affected parts of the chest wall together 
with the tumour and the use of plastic procedures allow to arrest further 
development of severe complications in the majority of patients and create 
conditions for the continuation of the anti-tumour treatment. Plastic and 
reconstructive surgery permits to extend operability limits and thereby improve 
the quality of the treatment and increase life expectancy of the patients with 
extensive tumorigenic process.

BACKGROUND: Most patients with chest pain have nothing wrong with their cardiac 
function. Psychological forms of treatment for this condition are more likely to 
be successful than others.
METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm parallel controlled randomized trial of standard care 
versus a modified form of cognitive behaviour therapy for chest pain (CBT-CP) in 
patients who have attended emergency hospital services. Inclusion criteria 
include (i) emergency attendance more than once in the previous year with chest 
pain when no physical pathology has been found, (ii) aged between 16 and 75, 
(iii) signed consent to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria are (i) under 
current psychiatric care, (ii) those who have had new psychotropic drugs 
prescribed within the last two months, (iii) are receiving or about to receive a 
formal psychological treatment. Those satisfying these criteria will be 
randomized to 4-10 sessions of CBT-CP or to continue with standard care. 
Participants are randomized using a remote web-based system using permuted 
stacked blocks stratified by study centre. Assessment is carried out at baseline 
by researchers subsequently masked to allocation and at 6 months and 1 year 
after randomization. The primary outcome is the Health Anxiety Inventory score 
at 6 months, and secondary outcomes are generalised anxiety and depressive 
symptoms, the Lucock Health Anxiety Questionnaire adapted for chest pain, visual 
analogue scales for chest pain and discomfort (Inskip Scale), the Schedule for 
Evaluating Persistent Symptoms (SEPS), health related quality of life, social 
functioning and medical resource usage. Intention to treat analyses will be 
carried out with clinical and functioning data, and a cost-utility analysis will 
compare differences in total costs and differences in quality of life using 
QALYs derived from the EQ-5D. The data will also be linked to another parallel 
study in New Zealand where 126 patients with the same inclusion criteria have 
been treated in a similar trial; the form of analysis of the combined data has 
yet to be determined.
DISCUSSION: The morbidity and costs of non-cardiac chest pain are substantial 
and if a simple psychological treatment given by health professionals working in 
medical departments is beneficial it should prove to be of great value. 
Combining data with a similar study in New Zealand is an additional asset.

Reductions in DNA integrity, genome stability, and telomere length are strongly 
associated with the aging process, age-related diseases as well as the 
age-related loss of muscle mass. However, in people reaching an age far beyond 
their statistical life expectancy the prevalence of diseases, such as cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes or dementia, is much lower compared to 
"averagely" aged humans. These inverse observations in nonagenarians (90-99 
years), centenarians (100-109 years) and super-centenarians (110 years and 
older) require a closer look into dynamics underlying DNA damage within the 
oldest old of our society. Available data indicate improved DNA repair and 
antioxidant defense mechanisms in "super old" humans, which are comparable with 
much younger cohorts. Partly as a result of these enhanced endogenous repair and 
protective mechanisms, the oldest old humans appear to cope better with risk 
factors for DNA damage over their lifetime compared to subjects whose lifespan 
coincides with the statistical life expectancy. This model is supported by study 
results demonstrating superior chromosomal stability, telomere dynamics and DNA 
integrity in "successful agers". There is also compelling evidence suggesting 
that life-style related factors including regular physical activity, a 
well-balanced diet and minimized psycho-social stress can reduce DNA damage and 
improve chromosomal stability. The most conclusive picture that emerges from 
reviewing the literature is that reaching "super old" age appears to be 
primarily determined by hereditary/genetic factors, while a healthy lifestyle 
additionally contributes to achieving the individual maximum lifespan in humans. 
More research is required in this rapidly growing population of super old 
people. In particular, there is need for more comprehensive investigations 
including short- and long-term lifestyle interventions as well as investigations 
focusing on the mechanisms causing DNA damage, mutations, and telomere 
shortening.

OBJECTIVE: Smokers have lower short-term mortality after acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) than non-smokers; however, little is known about the long-term 
effects of smoking on life expectancy after AMI. This study aimed to quantify 
the burden of smoking after AMI using life expectancy and years of life lost.
METHODS: We analysed data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a medical 
record study of 158,349 elderly Medicare patients with AMI and over 17 years of 
follow-up, to evaluate the age-specific association of smoking with life 
expectancy and years of life lost after AMI.
RESULTS: Our sample included 23,447 (14.8%) current smokers. Current smokers had 
lower crude mortality up to 5 years, which was largely explained by their 
younger age at AMI. After adjustment other patient characteristics, smoking was 
associated with lower 30-day (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.94) but higher long-term 
mortality (17-year HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.20) after AMI. Overall, crude life 
expectancy estimates were lower for current smokers than non-smokers at all 
ages, which translated into sizeable numbers of life-years lost attributable to 
smoking. As age at AMI increased, the magnitude of life-years lost due to 
smoking decreased. After full risk adjustment, the differences in life 
expectancy between current smokers and non-smokers persisted at all ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with lower life expectancy and large 
numbers of life-years lost after AMI. Our findings lend additional support to 
smoking cessation efforts after AMI.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is becoming widely adopted in the 
treatment of primary and secondary tumors. Spinal bone metastases are frequently 
discovered in cancer patients, and in the past have been usually treated with a 
palliative goal. Nevertheless, in some particular clinical settings, such as 
oligometastatic patients and/or those with a long life expectancy, spinal SBRT 
could be considered a valid therapeutic option to obtain long-lasting palliation 
and, when possible, with a curative goal. This review aims to summarize 
available clinical and dosimetric data of published studies about spinal SBRT.

BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation medications have been shown to yield higher 
success rates and sustained abstinence than unassisted quit attempts. In Japan, 
the treatments available include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and 
varenicline; however, unassisted attempts to quit smoking remain common.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the health and economic 
consequences in Japan of using pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation with 
unassisted attempts and the current mix of strategies used.
METHODS: A discrete-event simulation that models lifetime quitting behaviour and 
includes multiple quit attempts (MQAs) and relapses was adapted for these 
analyses. The risk of developing smoking-related diseases is estimated based on 
the duration of abstinence. Data collected from a survey conducted in Japan were 
used to determine the interventions selected by smokers initiating a quit 
attempt and the time between MQAs. Direct and indirect costs are assessed 
(expressed in 2014 Japanese Yen).
RESULTS: Using pharmacotherapy (NRT or varenicline) to support quit attempts 
proved to be dominant when compared with unassisted attempts or the current mix 
of strategies (most are unassisted). The results of stratified analyses by age 
imply that smoking cessation improves health outcomes across all generations. 
Indirect costs due to premature death leading to lost wages are an important 
component of the total costs, exceeding the direct medical cost estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased utilisation of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to 
support quit attempts is predicted to lead to an increase in the number of 
smokers achieving abstinence, and provide improvements in health outcomes over a 
lifetime with no additional costs.

Mortality during the early stages is a major cause of the natural variations in 
the size and recruitment strength of marine fish populations. In this study, the 
relation between the size-at-hatch and early survival was assessed using 
laboratory experiments and on field-caught larvae of the European sardine 
(Sardina pilchardus). Larval size-at-hatch was not related to the egg size but 
was significantly, positively related to the diameter of the otolith-at-hatch. 
Otolith diameter-at-hatch was also significantly correlated with survival-at-age 
in fed and unfed larvae in the laboratory. For sardine larvae collected in the 
Bay of Biscay during the spring of 2008, otolith radius-at-hatch was also 
significantly related to viability. Larval mortality has frequently been related 
to adverse environmental conditions and intrinsic factors affecting feeding 
ability and vulnerability to predators. Our study offers evidence indicating 
that a significant portion of fish mortality occurs during the endogenous (yolk) 
and mixed (yolk /prey) feeding period in the absence of predators, revealing 
that marine fish with high fecundity, such as small pelagics, can spawn a 
relatively large amount of eggs resulting in small larvae with no chances to 
survive. Our findings help to better understand the mass mortalities occurring 
at early stages of marine fish.

Health and Nutrition, Japan.

Prevention of non-communicable diseases is more important than ever especially 
for the elderly to live a healthy life in the super-aged society of Japan. In 
2000, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan started Health Japan 21 
as goal-oriented health promotion plan like Healthy People in the US and the 
Health of the Nation in the UK. Its second term started in 2013 with the aim of 
prolonging healthy life expectancy and reducing health inequalities. Improvement 
in both individuals' lifestyle and their social environment will help achieve 
the goal of the 2nd Health Japan 21. The National Health and Nutrition Survey 
(NHNS) is conducted every year to monitor the health and nutritional situation 
of the Japanese using a representative population. The NHNS data are useful for 
target setting and evaluation of the 2nd Health Japan 21, and the NHNS has shown 
an increasing trend of overweight (BMI≥25) only for male adults in the most 
recent 10 y. In contrast, the dietary intake survey of the NHNS shows a 
decreasing trend of total energy intake both in male and female adults aged 69 y 
old or younger, and the trend for physical activity is not well known. Thus, we 
need further investigations on the causes of the obesity trend in Japan.

The Issue of Nutrition in an Aging Society.

University.

Viewed from a global perspective, Japan is often considered a country where the 
progression towards a low birthrate and longevity has been prominent. In 2007, 
the ratio of the aged population reached 21.5%, propelling Japan into the 
classification of a super aging society. The long-term care insurance system in 
Japan was initiated in the year 2000, as a general long-term care service system 
for the whole society, covering the nutrition, medical care, and welfare fields. 
The goal of nutrition in an aged society is the extension of healthy life 
expectancy. The ratio of elderly citizens with malnutrition is high. Due to the 
loss of teeth, and a decrease in digestive and physical functions, there is 
often a decrease in appetite, and the inability to obtain enough nutrition for 
physical homeostasis is related to such conditions as frailty and the partial 
loss of physical functions due to sarcopenia, as well as a decrease in the 
quality of life (QOL). The elderly can easily fall into a state of protein and 
energy malnutrition (PEM), due to a variety of causes. Accordingly, it is 
important to adopt an appropriate approach that ensures a correct understanding 
of the causes of malnutrition and the special characteristics of malnutrition in 
the elderly.

The School Meal System and School-Based Nutrition Education in Korea.

Woo T(1).

Author information:
(1)Changwon National University.

Since the school meal was first served in Korea in 1953, there have been many 
changes, particularly during the last decade. Recently, the representative 
features of the school meal system became free school meals for all pupils in 
elementary school and a nutrition teacher system in schools. These policies were 
suggested to implement more and more the educational role of the school meal. 
The rate of schools serving school meals reached 100% as of 2013, and 99.6% 
students eat a school meal each school day. Nutrition teachers were assigned to 
schools from 2007, and 4,704 (47.9%) nutrition teachers of all nutrition 
employees were employed in schools as of 2013. At present, various nutrition 
education materials are being development by local education offices and 
government agencies, and various education activities are being implemented 
spiritedly. The ultimate goal of school meals and school-based nutrition 
education are as follows: 1) improvement of the health of students; 2) promotion 
of the traditional Korean diet; and 3) extension of opportunities for a 
healthier dietary life.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis use is associated with several adverse health 
effects. However, little is known about the cannabis-attributable burden of 
disease. This study quantified the age-, sex- and adverse health effect-specific 
cannabis-attributable (1) mortality, (2) years of life lost due to premature 
mortality (YLLs), (3) years of life lost due to disability (YLDs) and (4) 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Canada in 2012.
DESIGN: Epidemiological modeling.
SETTING: Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Canadians aged ≥ 15 years in 2012.
MEASUREMENTS: Using comparative risk assessment methodology, 
cannabis-attributable fractions were computed using Canadian exposure data and 
risk relations from large studies or meta-analyses. Outcome data were obtained 
from Canadian databases and the World Health Organization. The 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were computed using Monte Carlo methodology.
FINDINGS: Cannabis use was estimated to have caused 287 deaths (95% CI = 108, 
609), 10,533 YLLs (95% CI = 4760, 20,833), 55,813 YLDs (95% CI = 38,175, 74,094) 
and 66,346 DALYs (95% CI = 47,785, 87,207), based on causal impacts on cannabis 
use disorders, schizophrenia, lung cancer and road traffic injuries. 
Cannabis-attributable burden of disease was highest among young people, and 
males accounted for twice the burden than females. Cannabis use disorders were 
the most important single cause of the cannabis-attributable burden of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The cannabis-attributable burden of disease in Canada in 2012 
included 55,813 years of life lost due to disability, caused mainly by cannabis 
use disorders. Although the cannabis-attributable burden of disease was 
substantial, it was much lower compared with other commonly used legal and 
illegal substances. Moreover, the evidence base for cannabis-attributable harms 
was smaller.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common aneuploidy of chromosome 21, characterized 
by the presence of an extra copy of that chromosome (trisomy 21). Children with 
DS present with an abnormal phenotype, which is attributed to a loss of genetic 
balance or an excess dose of chromosome 21 genes. In recent years, advances in 
prenatal screening and diagnostic tests have aided in the early diagnosis and 
appropriate management of fetuses with DS. A myriad of clinical symptoms 
resulting from cognitive, physical, and physiological impairments caused by 
aberrations in various systems of the body occur in DS. However, despite these 
impairments, which range from trivial to fatal manifestations, the survival rate 
of individuals with DS has increased dramatically from less than 50% during the 
mid-1990s to 95% in the early 2000s, with a median life expectancy of 60 years 
reported recently. The aim of this narrative review is to review and summarize 
the etiopathology, prenatal screening and diagnostic tests, prognosis, clinical 
manifestations in various body systems, and comorbidities associated with DS.

The Klotho protein is a β-glucuronidase, and its overexpression is associated 
with life extension. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, although 
it has been recently reported that αKlotho improves synaptic and cognitive 
functions, and it may also influence a variety of structures and functions 
during CNS maturation and aging. The αKlotho gene has two transcripts, one 
encoding a transmembrane isoform (m-KL), and the other a putative secreted 
isoform (s-KL). Unfortunately, little is known about the secreted αKlotho 
isoform, since available antibodies cannot discriminate s-KL from the KL1 domain 
cleaved from the transmembrane isoform. This study shows, for the first time, 
that the klotho transcript produced by alternative splicing generates a stable 
protein (70 kDa), and that in contrast to the transmembrane Klotho isoform, it 
is ten times more abundant in the brain than in the kidney suggesting that the 
two isoforms may have different functions. We also studied whether klotho 
expression in the CNS was influenced by aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), or a 
healthy lifestyle, such as voluntary moderate continuous exercise. We observed a 
strong correlation between high expression levels of the two klotho transcripts 
and the healthy status of the animals. Expression of Klotho in brain areas 
decayed more rapidly in the 3xTg-AD model of AD than in healthy animals, whilst 
moderate continuous exercise in adulthood prevents the decline in expression of 
both klotho transcripts.
