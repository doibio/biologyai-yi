Lewis lung carcinoma induced mouse (C57/BL6) model. The recombinant peptide was 
confirmed to be displayed on the surface of M13 phage as an extension for 
phage's PVIII protein. Immunization of mice with peptide-phage vaccine resulted 
in antibody production against EM-L2 and significant reduction of tumor growth 
rate by nearly 25 percent. In conclusion, EM-L2 displaying phage particles could 
be deemed as an encouraging strategy in contemporary cancer immunotherapy.

The elevation of systolic blood pressure (BP) is a particularly significant 
event in the elderly population, where it is estimated that over 68% of the 
population is hypertensive. Treatment of hypertension in the elderly population 
is quite beneficial, but it would be necessary take into account some special 
characteristics of these patients, such as altered pharmacokinetics, 
comorbidity, or polypharmacy. The available evidence in individuals aged> 80 
years seems to indicate that antihypertensive treatment results in a reduction 
of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In any case, it is advisable to 
individualize treatment and it should assess their quality of previous life, 
their life expectancy and cardiovascular risk situation. The BP from which to 
establish drug treatment or reduction targets to achieve BP are the points 
discussed in different international guidelines. © 2017 SEHLELHA. Published by

The diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases whose common link is 
hyperglycemia secondary to a deficit of insulin secretion, the defect of 
metabolic activity or both, causing micro and / or macrovascular chronic 
complications. Its prevalence is 13.6% and the direct costs of 2,500 million 
euros annually. Proper management of diabetes in hypertensive patients includes 
reaching a comprehensive control of all cardiovascular risk factors present. 
Objectives should be individualized depending on various factors such as age, 
duration of diabetes, presence or absence of complications and frequency of 
hypoglycemia, the capacity of each patient based on their cognitive status, 
support socio-family and Life expectancy. © 2017 SEHLELHA. Published by Elsevier

Due to the rising life expectancy, bone diseases (e.g. osteoporosis, 
osteoarthritis) and trauma (e.g. fracture) have become an important 
socio-economic burden. Accurate visualization and quantification of the bone 
microstructure in vivo is seen as an important step to enhance diagnosis and 
treatment. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) has become the gold standard in 
three-dimensional (3D) imaging of trabecular bone structure. Yet, usage is 
limited to ex vivo analyses, hence, it cannot be used to evaluate bone and bone 
adaptive responses in a patient. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography 
(HR-pQCT) is considered the best technique to measure the bone microarchitecture 
in vivo. By design HR-pQCT is limited to scanning extremities, such as the 
distal radius and distal tibia with a limited field of view and long scanning 
time (~2 à 3 min. for a stack of 0.9 cm). Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
is a promising alternative with a much larger field of view. Yet, CBCT is 
challenged by artefacts that reduce image contrast, such that it is currently 
being used for qualitative evaluation only. Therefore, the aims of this work 
were first to enhance image contrast and second to determine the accuracy of 
high-resolution CBCT for bone microarchitectural assessment. Trapezia of 
nineteen female arthritic patients were scanned twice ex vivo; once using CBCT 
(NewTom 5G, Cefla, Verona, Italy) at a nominal voxel size of 75 μm and once 
using microCT (SkyScan 1172, Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) at a voxel size of 19.84 
μm. The CBCT-scans were reconstructed following 2 protocols: (1) using the 
commercial software delivered with the scanner and (2) using in-house developed 
software. After reconstruction and image processing, the images were segmented 
using adaptive thresholding. Bone morphometric parameters including bone volume 
(BV), total tissue volume (TV), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone surface 
density (BS/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and 
trabecular number (Tb.N) were calculated. Statistical evaluations were made at a 
significance level of 5%. Significant correlations were found between the 
CBCT-based bone parameters and the microCT-based parameters with R2 > 0.68 The 
in-house reconstructed software outperformed the commercial software. Smaller 
bias (overestimation of Tb.Th decreased from 114.24% to 59.96%) as well as 
higher correlations were observed for the in-house processed images. Still, a 
significant overestimation was observed for BV/TV and Tb. Th and an 
underestimation for Tb.N. We conclude that our CBCT image reconstruction 
improved image contrast which allowed for an accurate quantification of 
trabecular bone microarchitecture.

OBJECTIVES: Schwannomatosis is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to 
schwannomas of mainly spinal and peripheral nerves with some diagnostic overlap 
with neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2), but the underlying epidemiology is poorly 
understood. We present the birth incidence and prevalence allowing for overlap 
with NF2.
METHODS: Schwannomatosis and NF2 cases were ascertained from the Manchester 
region of England (population=4.8 million) and from across the UK. Point 
prevalence and birth incidence were calculated from regional birth statistics. 
Genetic analysis was also performed on NF2, LZTR1 and SMARCB1 on blood and 
tumour DNA samples when available.
RESULTS: Regional prevalence for schwannomatosis and NF2 were 1 in 126 315 and 
50 500, respectively, with calculated birth incidences of 1 in 68 956 and 1 in 
27 956. Mosaic NF2 causes a substantial overlap with schwannomatosis resulting 
in the misdiagnosis of at least 9% of schwannomatosis cases. LZTR1-associated 
schwannomatosis also causes a small number of cases that are misdiagnosed with 
NF2 (1%-2%), due to the occurrence of a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. 
Patients with schwannomatosis had lower numbers of non-vestibular cranial 
schwannomas, but more peripheral and spinal nerve schwannomas with pain as a 
predominant presenting symptom. Life expectancy was significantly better in 
schwannomatosis (mean age at death 76.9) compared with NF2 (mean age at death 
66.2; p=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Within the highly ascertained North-West England population, 
schwannomatosis has less than half the birth incidence and prevalence of NF2.

Ever since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 
1995, HIV infection has been linked to "metabolic" complications (insulin 
resistance, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and others). Studies suggested increased 
rates of myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, neurocognitive dysfunction, 
and fractures in HIV-postitive patients. Even long-term suppression of HIV 
seemed to be accompanied by an excess of deleterious inflammation that could 
promote these complications. The aims of this viewpoint paper are to summarize 
recent data and to examine the possibility that the problem of aging-related 
morbidity in HIV might not be as dramatic as previously believed.

Pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia spectrum disorders: State of the Art Abstract. 
Schizophrenia is a disorder, whose cause and course are still a puzzle. 
Nevertheless its treatment has made big progresses during the last decades. 
Early recognition and early treatment of the disorder are very important for a 
good outcome. Any of the four stages of the illness needs its own treatment 
concept. Today the gold standard during a acute / progressive psychotic phase is 
primarily the prescription of an 2nd generation antipsychotic (atypicals). 
Regarding the goal of remission and relapse prevention close monitoring of side 
effects (TEE = treatment emergent events) are key. Adherence and an appropriate 
relapse prevention can change the course of this severe disorder significantly 
to the better. Long acting injectables (LAI's) turned out to be helpful in this 
regard. - Patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disoder have a significant 
shortened life expectancy compared to the normal population. Therefor close 
monitoring of cardio-metabolic parameters by general practitioners is very 
important.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die Schizophrenie ist eine Erkrankung, deren Ursache 
und Verlauf immer noch viele Rätsel aufgibt. In der Behandlung konnten in den 
letzten Jahrzehnten grosse Fortschritte erzielt werden. Eine frühe Erkennung und 
Behandlung der Erkrankung ist für den Verlauf sehr wichtig. Jede der vier 
bekannten Krankheitsphasen bei dieser Erkrankung bedarf eines spezifischen 
Behandlungsansatzes. Während einer psychotischen Akutphase werden heute v. a. 
Antipsychotika der 2. Generation (Atypika) eingesetzt. Dabei wird den 
unerwünschten Arzneimittelwirkungen (UAW) sowohl in Bezug auf die Erreichung 
einer Remission als auch im Rahmen der Rückfallprophylaxe eine Schlüsselrolle 
eingeräumt. Eine Adhärenz und eine geeignete Prophylaxe zur Verhinderung 
weiterer psychotischer Episoden können den Verlauf dieser ernsthaften Erkrankung 
deutlich verbessern. Lang wirksame Präparate (Depotpräparate) haben sich hier 
sehr bewährt. Patienten mit einer schizophrenen Störung haben eine deutlich 
geringere Lebenserwartung als die Normalbevölkerung, weshalb das Monitoring 
durch den Allgemeinarzt in Bezug auf metabolische Parameter eine grosse Rolle 
spielt.

Sport as applied therapy in patients with schizophrenic psychoses Abstract. 
Schizophrenic psychoses are serious mental illnesses associated with low life 
expectancy compared with healthy individuals and other psychiatric disorders. 
Overweight and associated health problems such as diabetes mellitus, 
cardiovascular disease and smoking-associated lung disease have been shown to be 
risk factors related to high mortality. Low physical activity and increased 
sedentary behavior have been identified as the most important behavioral risk 
factors for cardiovascular diseases in people with schizophrenia. Numerous 
research results show a positive influence of sport on mental symptoms as well 
as on physical health. In the studies, however, different types of guided 
movement with divergent intensity were used in group or single setting. The 
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und 
Nervenheilkunde [German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and 
Psychosomatics] recommends sports and physical exercise interventions for 
patients with severe mental illnesses. Still, further large randomized 
controlled trials are needed to investigate the nature, extent and duration, as 
well as the effect of the methods used in the various stages of the disease. One 
goal should be the evidence-based implementation of specific and systematic 
sport and movement interventions as a complementary module in addition to 
psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in people with 
schizophrenia.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Schizophrene Psychosen sind schwere psychische 
Erkrankungen, die im Vergleich zu gesunden Individuen und anderen 
psychiatrischen Störungen mit einer geringen Lebenserwartung einhergehen. Als 
Risikofaktoren für die erhöhte Mortalität werden Übergewicht und zugehörige 
Gesundheitsprobleme wie Diabetes mellitus, kardiovaskuläre Erkrankungen und mit 
Rauchen assoziierte Lungenerkrankungen genannt. Geringe körperliche Aktivität 
und vermehrtes sedentäres Verhalten wurden als wichtiger behavioraler 
Risikofaktor für kardiovaskuläre Erkrankungen bei Menschen mit Schizophrenie 
identifiziert. Zahlreiche Forschungsergebnisse zeigen einen positiven Einfluss 
von Sport sowohl auf die psychische Symptomatik als auch die körperliche 
Gesundheit. In den vorliegenden Studien kamen jedoch unterschiedliche Arten von 
angeleiteter Bewegung mit divergierender Intensität im Gruppen- oder 
Einzelsetting zur Anwendung. Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und 
Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und Nervenheilkunde (DGPPN) empfiehlt den Einsatz 
von sport- und bewegungstherapeutischen Interventionen, aber es werden weitere 
grosse randomisiert kontrollierte Studien benötigt, um Art, Umfang und Dauer 
sowie die Wirkung der eingesetzten Methoden in den verschiedenen Phasen der 
Erkrankung zu untersuchen. Ein Ziel dabei sollte die evidenzbasierte 
Implementierung von spezifischen und systematischen sport- und 
bewegungstherapeutischen Interventionen als ergänzender Baustein neben der 
psychopharmakologischen und psychotherapeutischen Behandlung bei Menschen mit 
Schizophrenie sein.

OBJECTIVES: As model-based economic evaluations (MBEEs) are widely used to make 
decisions in the context of policy, it is imperative that they represent 
clinical practice. Here, we assess the relevance of MBEEs on dabigatran for the 
prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: We performed a systematic review on the basis of a developed 
questionnaire, tailored to oral anticoagulation in patients with AF. Included 
studies had a full body text in English, compared dabigatran with a vitamin K 
antagonist, were not dedicated to one or more subgroup(s), and yielded an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The relevance of all MBEEs was assessed on 
the basis of ten context-independent factors, which encompassed clinical 
outcomes and treatment duration. The MBEEs performed for the United States were 
assessed on the basis of seventeen context-dependent factors, which were related 
to the country's target population and clinical environment.
RESULTS: The search yielded twenty-nine MBEEs, of which six were performed for 
the United States. On average, 54 percent of the context-independent factors 
were included per study, and 37 percent of the seventeen context-dependent 
factors in the U.S.
STUDIES: The share of relevant factors per study did not increase over time.
CONCLUSIONS: MBEEs on dabigatran leave out several relevant factors, limiting 
their usefulness to decision makers. We strongly urge health economic 
researchers to improve the relevance of their MBEEs by including 
context-independent relevance factors, and modeling context-dependent factors 
befitting the decision context concerned.

BACKGROUND: Population-wide screening for melanoma is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. Nevertheless, targeted surveillance of high-risk individuals may 
be.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of various surveillance 
strategies in the UK population, stratified by risk using a simple 
self-assessment tool scoring between 0 and 67.
METHODS: A decision model comparing alternative surveillance policies from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service over 30 years was developed. The 
strategy with the highest expected net benefit for each risk score was 
identified, resulting in a compound risk-stratified policy describing the most 
cost-effective population-wide strategy. The overall expected cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
and associated uncertainty were reported.
RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy is for those with a Williams score of 
15 to 21 (relative risk [RR] of 0.79-1.60 vs. a mean score of 17 in the United 
Kingdom) to be offered a one-off full-body skin examination, and for those with 
a score of 22 or more (RR 1.79+) to be enrolled into a quinquennial monitoring 
program, rising to annual recall for those with a risk score greater than 43 (RR 
20.95+). Expected incremental cost would be £164 million per annum (~0.1% of the 
National Health Service budget), gaining 15,947 additional QALYs and yielding an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £10,199/QALY gained (51.3% probability 
<£30,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk-stratified policy would be expensive to implement but 
cost-effective compared with typical UK thresholds (£20,000-£30,000/QALY 
gained), although decision uncertainty is high. Phased implementation enrolling 
only higher risk individuals would be substantially less expensive, but with 
consequent foregone health gain.

OBJECTIVES: The Eighth Mount Hood Challenge (held in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 
September 2016) evaluated the transparency of model input documentation from two 
published health economics studies and developed guidelines for improving 
transparency in the reporting of input data underlying model-based economic 
analyses in diabetes.
METHODS: Participating modeling groups were asked to reproduce the results of 
two published studies using the input data described in those articles. Gaps in 
input data were filled with assumptions reported by the modeling groups. 
Goodness of fit between the results reported in the target studies and the 
groups' replicated outputs was evaluated using the slope of linear regression 
line and the coefficient of determination (R2). After a general discussion of 
the results, a diabetes-specific checklist for the transparency of model input 
was developed.
RESULTS: Seven groups participated in the transparency challenge. The reporting 
of key model input parameters in the two studies, including the baseline 
characteristics of simulated patients, treatment effect and treatment 
intensification threshold assumptions, treatment effect evolution, prediction of 
complications and costs data, was inadequately transparent (and often missing 
altogether). Not surprisingly, goodness of fit was better for the study that 
reported its input data with more transparency. To improve the transparency in 
diabetes modeling, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist listing the minimal 
input data required for reproducibility in most diabetes modeling applications 
was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Transparency of diabetes model inputs is important to the 
reproducibility and credibility of simulation results. In the Eighth Mount Hood 
Challenge, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist was developed with the goal of 
improving the transparency of input data reporting and reproducibility of 
diabetes simulation model results.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that methods based on mixture models work well 
when mapping clinical to preference-based methods.
OBJECTIVES: To develop these methods in different ways and to compare 
performance in a case study.
METHODS: Data from 856 patients with asthma allowed mapping between the Asthma 
Quality of Life Questionnaire and both the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional 
questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the health utilities index mark 3 (HUI3). Adjusted 
limited dependent variable mixture models and beta-based mixture models were 
estimated. Optional inclusion of the gap between full health and the next value 
as well as a mass point at the next feasible value were explored.
RESULTS: In all cases, model specifications formally modeling the gap between 
full health and the next feasible value were an improvement on those that did 
not. Mapping to the HUI3 required more components in the mixture models than did 
mapping to the EQ-5D-5L because of its uneven distribution. The optimal 
beta-based mixture models mapping to the HUI3 included a probability mass at the 
utility value adjacent to full health. This is not the case when estimating the 
EQ-5D-5L, because of the low proportion of observations at this point.
CONCLUSIONS: Beta-based mixture models marginally outperformed adjusted limited 
dependent variable mixture models with the same number of components in this 
data set. Nevertheless, they require a larger number of parameters and longer 
estimation time. Both mixture model types closely fit both EQ-5D-5L and HUI 
data. Standard mapping approaches typically lead to biased estimates of health 
gain. The mixture model approaches exhibit no such bias. Both can be used with 
confidence in applied cost-effectiveness studies. Future mapping studies in 
other disease areas should consider similar methods.

Value assessment in oncology drugs: funding of drugs for metastatic breast 
cancer in Canada.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for women with metastatic breast cancer has improved 
since the early 2000s, in part because of the introduction of novel therapies, 
including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted agents. However, those 
treatments can come at a cost for the patient (short- and long-term toxicities 
from treatment) and at a financial cost for the health care system. Given the 
increase in the number of costly anticancer agents being introduced into the 
clinical setting, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (asco) and the 
European Society for Medical Oncology (esmo) have developed a system to quantify 
the value of new cancer treatments in terms of benefit, toxicities, and costs.
METHODS: In our value-assessment analysis, we included drugs that were funded in 
Canada between 2012 and 2017 for metastatic breast cancer. We reviewed the 
clinical benefit of those agents (survival, progression, quality of life), their 
costs, their value according to the asco and esmo value frameworks, and their 
assessments from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review [pcodr (in Canada, except 
Quebec)] and the Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux 
[iness (in Quebec)].
RESULTS: Drugs funded in Canada showed variation in their asco net health 
benefit scores and esmo magnitude of clinical benefit scores, but all had a 
cost-effectiveness ratio greater than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. 
The strength and magnitude of the clinical benefit (for example, overall 
survival benefit vs. progression-free survival benefit) was not necessarily 
associated with a higher value score.
CONCLUSIONS: Although great progress has been made in developing value 
frameworks, use of those frameworks has to be refined to help patients and 
health care providers make informed decisions about the benefit of novel cancer 
therapies and to help policymakers make decisions about the societal benefit of 
funding those therapies.

In the last few decades, the relationship between physical conditions and mental 
health has increasingly attracted the interest of researchers and professionals 
across disciplines. This relationship is especially relevant in old age, as the 
challenges posed by aging at various levels represent crucial concerns for 
policy makers. Due to the remarkable increase in life expectancy across 
countries, sustainable prevention strategies are needed to help individuals 
preserve psychophysical well-being in old age. In particular, the regular 
practice of a moderately intense physical activity is recommended by the World 
Health Organization to enhance balance, prevent falls, strengthen muscles, and 
promote psychophysical well-being. Daily physical exercise represents a 
beneficial and low-cost strategy, easily accessible to the general population 
and potentially customizable to specific needs through brief training programs. 
Based on these premises, the present research aimed at longitudinally evaluating 
mental well-being among 58 Italian people aged 67-85, who were involved in two 
Adapted Physical Activity (APA) training programs. Inclusion criteria for 
participation comprised high autonomy levels in daily activities, no cognitive 
impairment, sedentary habits or only occasional performance of moderate physical 
activity. Based on physical and functional assessment, 39 participants joined a 
program of adapted motor activity (PoliFit; Study 1), while 19 participants 
attended a variant program specifically designed for people with osteoporosis 
(OsteoFit; Study 2). Well-being dimensions were assessed through the Mental 
Health Continuum-Short Form, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the 
Satisfaction with Life Scale. Physical functioning were evaluated before and 
after the programs through the Short Physical Performance Battery and the 
Handgrip Dynamometer Jamar Test. Findings highlighted that, besides physical 
benefits, participants reported significantly more adaptive emotion regulation 
strategies after both training programs; in addition, participants attending 
OsteoFit reported significantly higher levels of emotional well-being. Results 
suggest the potential of moderate physical activity in promoting mental health, 
emphasizing the additional role of training programs as cost-effective 
opportunities for elderly people to socialize and improve emotional functioning. 
Overall, the findings support the view of old age as a stage of competence 
development and adaptive adjustment, rather than a phase of mere psychophysical 
decline.

In the Pacific Northwest of the USA, winter and spring temperature vary with the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, making effects of anthropogenic warming difficult 
to detect. We sought to detect community-level signals of anthropogenic change 
in a legacy plant phenology dataset. We analyzed both incomplete data from 1959 
to 2016 on spring phenology of 115 species and more complete 1996-2016 data on 
spring and fall events for 607 plant species. We used ordination of the 
long-term dataset to identify two major axes of community-level change in 
phenology among years, with the first being a trend toward earlier spring 
phenology in more recent years. In contrast, for the short-term dataset, 
variation in spring phenology was mostly PDO-driven and did not reveal a strong 
trend over time. At both time scales, a second axis of phenological variation 
reflected summer and fall events, especially earlier appearance of fall color in 
recent years. In univariate analysis, more than 80% of individual species' leaf 
out dates and first flower dates occurred earlier over time, for an average 
advance across all species of 2.5 days per decade from 1959 to 2016. While most 
events did not advance in the period 1996-2016, fall color advanced by 10.6 days 
per decade, suggesting that intensification of summer drought has continued 
regardless of the PDO cycle. While estimates of slope over time depended 
strongly on the time window chosen for the analysis, estimates of slope versus 
temperature were consistently negative regardless of time window, averaging 
5-7 days per 1 °C for spring events.

Background and aims Chronic pain is a life altering condition and common among 
elderly persons. The 7-day buprenorphine patch could be a suitable treatment for 
managing chronic pain of moderate severity in elderly patients in Sweden. The 
objective of this analysis was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the 
7-day buprenorphine patch, versus no treatment, in patients >50 years old who 
suffer from moderate pain in a health economic perspective. An additional aim 
was to evaluate how the cost-effectiveness is affected by the choice of EQ-5D 
weights. Methods The annual treatment cost and the potential gains in 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of buprenorphine, compared to no 
treatment, were evaluated. Original EQ-5D data were collected from four clinical 
reference studies at baseline and at the final visit. Treatment effects on HRQoL 
were then assessed using both UK and Swedish EQ-5D weights. Annual treatment 
costs were calculated based on costs of physician visits and pharmaceuticals. 
The optimal treatment dose was 10-15 μg/h and the analysis was hence performed 
on both a 10- and a 15 μg/h buprenorphine patch. Results The analysis of 
buprenorphine treatment resulted in improved HRQoL in all reference studies, 
irrespective of choice of EQ-5D weight set. The change in quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs) varied with a gain of 0.042-0.118 using the UK weights and 
0.020-0.051 with the Swedish weights. The average annual treatment cost was 
SEK14454 for the 10μg/h patch and SEK17 017 for the 15 μg/h patch, while cost 
for the no-treatment alternative was SEK 9 960. The base case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) with the UK weights were SEK 40000-SEK 170000 
and SEK 90000-SEK 350000 when applying the Swedish weights. The corresponding 
ICER-span in the sensitivity analysis was SEK 15 000-SEK 400 000 when applying 
the UK weights and SEK 30 000-SEK 840 000 with the Swedish weights (SEK 100 is 
about €11). Conclusions The results imply that the 7-day buprenorphine patch may 
be a cost-effective treatment of moderate chronic pain in patients over 50 years 
of age. The UK and the Swedish EQ-5D weights generated vastly different HRQoL 
estimates but buprenorphine remains cost-effective regardless choice of weight 
set.

INTRODUCTION: Several regions in Canada have recently experienced sharp 
increases in opioid overdoses and related hospitalizations and deaths. This 
paper describes opioidrelated mortality and disability from opioid use disorder 
in Canada from 1990 to 2014 using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study.
METHODS: We used data from the GBD study to describe temporal trends (1990–2014) 
in opioid-related mortality and disability from opioid use disorder using common 
metrics: disability-adjusted life years (DALY), deaths, years of life lost (YLL) 
and years lived with disability (YLD). We also compared age-standardized YLL and 
DALY rates per 100 000 population between Canada, the USA and other regions.
RESULTS: The age-standardized opioid-related DALY rate in Canada was 355.5 per 
100 000 population in 2014, which was higher than the global rate of 193.2, but 
lower than the rate of 767.9 in the United States. Between 1990 and 2014, the 
age-standardized opioid-related YLL rate in Canada increased by 142.2%, while 
globally this rate decreased by 10.1%. In comparison with YLL, YLD accounted for 
a larger proportion of the overall opioid-related burden across all age groups. 
Health loss was greater for males than females, and highest among those aged 25 
to 29 years.
CONCLUSION: The health burden associated with opioid-related mortality and 
disability from opioid use disorder in Canada is significant and has increased 
dramatically from 1990 to 2014. These data point to a need for public health 
action including enhanced monitoring of a range of opioid-related harms.

We quantified the contributions of leading causes of death and drug overdose to 
changes in life expectancy at birth over time and inequalities by sex and 
socioeconomic status in British Columbia. From 2014 to 2016, life expectancy at 
birth declined by 0.38 years and drug overdose deaths (mainly opioid-involved) 
contributed a loss of 0.12 years of the decrease. The analysis also demonstrated 
that the higher drug overdose mortality among males and among those in lower 
socioeconomic status communities contributed to a differential decrease in life 
expectancy at birth for males and for those in the latter category.

Publisher: Nous avons quantifié la contribution des principales causes de décès 
et de surdose à l’évolution de l’espérance de vie à la naissance et aux 
disparités en matière de sexe et de situation socioéconomique en 
Colombie-Britannique. Entre 2014 et 2016, l’espérance de vie à la naissance a 
diminué de 0,38 an et les décès par surdose (principalement liés aux opioïdes) 
ont contribué à ce recul pour 0,12 an. L’analyse a également montré que le taux 
plus élevé de mortalité par surdose constaté chez les hommes et les membres des 
catégories socioéconomiques plus défavorisées a contribué à une diminution 
différentielle dans ces deux groupes de l’espérance de vie à la naissance.

INTRODUCTION: Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments seek to control seizures with 
minimal or no adverse effects, effects which can substantially impact costs and 
outcomes for patients, caregivers, and third party payers. The First and Second 
Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine recommend inclusion of a 
societal reference case, even in studies conducted from a healthcare sector 
perspective, for comparability of findings across studies. Cost and outcome 
evaluation components include direct medical, non-direct medical-related (e.g. 
patient-time and transportation costs for treatment) and non-healthcare sectors 
(e.g. lost productivity).
AREAS COVERED: Guided by Second Panel recommendations, this review developed an 
overall impact inventory and detailed adverse effect impact inventory to assess 
the scope and methods in published economic evaluations of AED treatments for 
adults with chronic epilepsy. Societal perspective evaluations or evaluations 
that utilized quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as an outcome were reviewed. 
The majority of reviewed articles were healthcare sector perspective studies, 
methods for estimating QALYs varied widely, and a minority considered specific 
AED treatment adverse effects.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Only considering a healthcare sector perspective fails to 
provide full information for patients on AED treatments. Using an impact 
inventory to guide study scope and design will facilitate full reporting of 
costs and benefits.

Aabstract Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal pain represents a significant 
health problem among adults in Norway. The prevalence of chronic pain is 
reported to be 35-53% in cross sectional studies of both genders. For many 
years, it has been a common opinion among medical doctors that chronic pain may 
indeed reduce a person's quality of life, but not affect life expectancy. 
However, over the previous two decades, reports about mortality and cause of 
death in individuals with chronic pain have been published. So far, several 
studies conclude that there is an increased mortality in patients with chronic 
pain, but it is not clear what causes this. Increased occurrences of 
cardio-vascular death or cancer death have been reported in some studies, but 
not verified in other studies. Aims of the study The aims of this study were to 
estimate the mortality rate in females with different extent of pain, to 
identify potential risk factors for death and to investigate if the causes of 
death differ according to prior reported pain. Methods This is a prospective 
population-based study of all women between 20 and 50 years registered in 
Arendal, Norway, in 1989 (N = 2498 individuals). At follow-up in 2007, 2261 
living females were retraced, 89 had died. All subjects received a questionnaire 
containing questions about chronic pain (pain ≥ 3 months duration in muscles, 
joints, back or the whole body) as well as 13 sub-questions about 
pain-modulating factors, non-specific health complaints and sleep problems, by 
mail in 1990, 1995 and 2007. Only subjects who answered the questionnaire in 
1990 were included in the analyses. Of the deceased, 71 had answered the 
questionnaire in 1990. A multivariate model for cox regression analysis was used 
in order to clarify if chronic pain, sleep problems, feeling anxious, frightened 
or nervous and number of unspecific health were risk factors for death. The 
causes of death of 87 of the deceased individuals were obtained by linking the 
ID-number with the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Results The ratio of 
deceased responders was 2% (14/870) among those with no pain versus 5% (57/1168) 
among those with chronic pain at baseline. When separating into chronic regional 
pain and chronic widespread pain, the mortality rate was respectively 4% and 8% 
in the different groups. Age adjusted hazard ratio for mortality rate in 
individuals with initially chronic pain was [HR 2.5 (CI 1.4-4.5)] compared to 
pain free individuals. In the multivariate analysis, having chronic pain [HR 2.1 
(1.1-4.2)] and feeling anxious, frightened or nervous [HR 3.2 (1.8-5.6)] were 
associated with increased risk of death. There was no difference in death from 
cardiovascular disease or malignancies between the groups of pain free 
individuals vs. the group of individuals with chronic pain. Conclusion The 
mortality rate was significantly higher for individuals with chronic pain 
compared to pain free individuals, adjusted for age. In addition, feeling 
anxious, frightened or nervous were risk factors for death. There was an 
increase in all-cause mortality.
