Economic Analysis of Patient Management Interventions in Heart Failure 
Cost-Effectiveness Model, which uses an individual-patient simulation model 
informed by the prospectively collected trial data. Data were analyzed from 
March 24, 2019, to December 1, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Rehabilitation intervention or control.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the 
lifetime estimated cost per QALY gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio).
RESULTS: Among the 349 patients included in the analysis (183 women [52.4%]; 
mean [SD] age, 72.7 [8.1] years; 176 non-White [50.4%] and 173 White [49.6%]), 
mean (SD) cumulative costs per patient were $26 421 ($38 955) in the 
intervention group (excluding intervention costs) and $27 650 ($30 712) in the 
control group (difference, -$1229; 95% CI, -$8159 to $6394; P = .80). The mean 
(SD) cost of the intervention was $4204 ($2059). Quality of life gains were 
significantly greater in the intervention vs control group during 6 months (mean 
utility difference, 0.074; P = .001) and sustained beyond the 12-week 
intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $58 409 
and $35 600 per QALY gained for the full cohort and in patients with preserved 
ejection fraction, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These analyses suggest that longer-term benefits of 
this novel rehabilitation intervention, particularly in the subgroup of patients 
with preserved ejection fraction, may yield good value to the health care 
system. However, long-term cost-effectiveness is currently uncertain and 
dependent on the assumption that benefits are sustained beyond study follow-up, 
which needs to be corroborated in future trials in this patient population.

Cancer is one of the world's major causes of mortality, and it plays a most 
important role in the world's declining life expectancy. F-box and WD-40 domain 
protein 7 (FBXW7), a typical participant of the F-box family of proteins, has 
been considered as an anti-tumor protein and one of the maximum deregulated 
ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins in uterine carcinosarcoma, endometrial 
clear cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma with the greatest prevalence of 
alterations. FBXW7 variants with known clinical significance, as well as 
non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the F-Box and WD40 
domains, were evaluated using functionality prediction web resources. Upon 
analysing the seventy-three deleterious nsSNP's impact on protein stability and 
function, we identified that forty-one nsSNPs of WD40 domain and three of F-Box 
domain imply decreased stability of the FBXW7 structure. Next to TP53 and PTEN, 
FBXW7 was reported with the highest percentage of arginine substitution among 
mutations related to cancer. The current research concentrated on two arginine 
residue locations (Arg465, Arg505) within the WD40-repeat domain, which is vital 
for substrate binding. Computational analysis revealed significant deviation in 
stability and structural configuration of mutants R505L, R465H, R465P, R505G, 
R505C, R465C, R505S and R505L structures. Protein-protein interaction network of 
FBXW7 populated with promising hub proteins NOTCH1, c-Myc, CCNE1, STYX, KLG5, 
SREB1, NFKB2, SKP1 and CUL1; thus, alteration in the FBXW7 leads to aberration 
in their signalling pathways as well as their substrate binding ability makes 
this protein as attractive target for personalized therapeutic intervention.

The core purpose of the study is to examine the asymmetric effect of foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and population health (measured by life expectancy 
index). The study takes time series data for 1980-2020. The non-linear 
autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) bound testing to cointegration approach 
is applied to scrutinize an asymmetric association among foreign direct 
investment, government expenditures, trade openness, public debt, and population 
health. The study also used an asymmetric causality test to investigate the 
causal association between the measured variables. The findings affirm that 
cointegration exists between the variables in the occurrence of asymmetries. The 
asymmetric causality outcomes confirm that only positive changes in FDI have 
bidirectional causality to life expectancy while negative shocks have 
unidirectional that runs from FDI to life expectancy. The government expenditure 
and foreign direct investment also provided evidence of social sector health 
welfare in Pakistan. The output shows that increasing government expenditure can 
cause an increase in life expectancy while decreasing government expenditure can 
cause a decrease in life expectancy. The study found that investment in health 
care medical services is paramount to better results as far as government 
assistance (welfare) gains. The outcomes of the study have given numerous policy 
suggestions to boost life expectancy in the general public of Pakistan.

Current advancements in prostate cancer (PC) therapies have been successful in 
slowing PC progression and increasing life expectancy; however, there is still 
no curative treatment for advanced metastatic castration resistant PC (mCRPC). 
Most treatment options target the androgen receptor, to which many PCs 
eventually develop resistance. Thus, there is a dire need to identify and 
validate new molecular targets for treating PC. We found NUAK family kinase 2 
(NUAK2) expression is elevated in PC and mCRPC versus normal tissue, and 
expression correlates with an increased risk of metastasis. Given this 
observation and because NUAK2, as a kinase, is actionable, we evaluated the 
potential of NUAK2 as a molecular target for PC. NUAK2 is a stress response 
kinase that also plays a role in activation of the YAP cotranscriptional 
oncogene. Combining pharmacological and genetic methods for modulating NUAK2, we 
found that targeting NUAK2 in vitro leads to reduction in proliferation, 
three-dimensional tumor spheroid growth, and matrigel invasion of PC cells. 
Differential gene expression analysis of PC cells treated NUAK2 small molecule 
inhibitor HTH-02-006 demonstrated that NUAK2 inhibition results in 
downregulation of E2F, EMT, and MYC hallmark gene sets after NUAK2 inhibition. 
In a syngeneic allograft model and in radical prostatectomy patient derived 
explants, NUAK2 inhibition slowed tumor growth and proliferation rates. 
Mechanistically, HTH-02-006 treatment led to inactivation of YAP and the 
downregulation of NUAK2 and MYC protein levels. Our results suggest that NUAK2 
represents a novel actionable molecular target for PC that warrants further 
exploration.

BACKGROUND: Reducing health inequalities in the UK has been a policy priority 
for over 20 years, yet, despite efforts to create a more equal society, progress 
has been limited. Furthermore, some inequalities have widened and become more 
apparent, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. With growing recognition of 
the uneven distribution of life expectancy and of mental and physical health, 
the current research was commissioned to identify future research priorities to 
address UK societal and structural health inequalities.
METHODS: An expert opinion consultancy process comprising an anonymous online 
survey and a consultation workshop were conducted to investigate priority areas 
for future research into UK inequalities. The seven-question survey asked 
respondents (n = 170) to indicate their current role, identify and prioritise 
areas of inequality, approaches and evaluation methods, and comment on future 
research priorities. The workshop was held to determine areas of research 
priority and attended by a closed list of delegates (n = 30) representing a 
range of academic disciplines and end-users of research from policy and 
practice. Delegates self-selected one of four breakout groups to determine 
research priority areas in four categories of inequality (health, social, 
economic, and other) and to allocate hypothetical sums of funding (half, one, 
five, and ten million pounds) to chosen priorities. Responses were analysed 
using mixed methods.
RESULTS: Survey respondents were mainly 'academics' (33%), 'voluntary/third 
sector professionals' (17%), and 'creative/cultural professionals'(16%). Survey 
questions identified the main areas of inequality as 'health' (58%), 'social 
care' (54%), and 'living standards' (47%). The first research priority was 
'access to creative and cultural opportunities' (37%), second, 'sense of place' 
(23%), and third, 'community' (17%). Approaches seen to benefit from more 
research in relation to addressing inequalities were 'health/social care' (55%), 
'advice services' (34%), and 'adult education/training' (26%). Preferred 
evaluation methods were 'community/participatory' (76%), 'action research' 
(62%), and 'questionnaires/focus groups' (53%). Survey respondents (25%) 
commented on interactions between inequalities and issues such as political and 
economic decisions, and climate. The key workshop finding from determining 
research priorities in areas of inequality was that health equity could only be 
achieved by tackling societal and structural inequalities, environmental 
conditions and housing, and having an active prevention programme.
CONCLUSIONS: Research demonstrates a clear need to assess the impact of cultural 
and natural assets in reducing inequality. Collaborations between community 
groups, service providers, local authorities, health commissioners, GPs, and 
researchers using longitudinal methods are needed within a multi-disciplinary 
approach to address societal and structural health inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a debilitating condition that 
impacts patients' and caregivers' quality of life (QOL) and reduces the 
patient's life expectancy. Since there is little qualitative research from the 
perspective of patients and family caregivers, this study explored the impact of 
NPC on patients' and caregivers' daily lives to understand the burden of 
disease.
RESULTS: A survey of caregivers for patients with NPC and adult patients with 
NPC (n = 49; patient age: 13 months-65 years) assessed NPC severity, importance 
of NPC symptoms, and how symptoms impacted patients' and caregivers' activities 
of daily living (ADLs) and health-related QOL (HRQOL). Follow-up interviews with 
a subset of survey participants (n = 28) explored the ranking of NPC symptom 
importance and impact on ADLs and HRQOL. Findings indicated that the most 
important manifestations of NPC were ambulation, swallowing, speech, fine motor 
skills, and cognition, which were those that had the most significant impact on 
ADLs and HRQOL. A wide range of ADLs were affected by NPC, mainly 
eating/drinking and the ability to perform daily tasks, including self-care, 
communicating, participating in school or work, and moving indoors as well as 
outside the home. Along with these impacts, there was an increased risk of 
experiencing dangerous or life-threatening situations leading to loss of patient 
independence and additional caregiver burden, often requiring changes in 
lifestyle such as giving up work. All aspects of patients' and caregivers' HRQOL 
were affected. Participants reported feelings of social isolation, loss of 
enjoyment in activities (patients), and feelings of sadness or worry 
(caregivers).
CONCLUSIONS: Ambulation, swallowing, speech, fine motor skills, and cognition 
are important manifestations of NPC. ADLs and HRQOL were impaired in the 
majority of patients as well as their caregivers. The findings were independent 
of current age, age of onset of symptoms, and level of NPC disease-related 
disability; however, the impact increased at higher levels of disease 
disability. Knowing the impact of NPC on patients and caregivers is important 
for understanding the lived experience of NPC and for identifying potential 
areas of support.

BACKGROUND: The burden of kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers has changed in 
recent decades. This study aims to investigate the global and regional burden 
of, and attributable risk factors for genitourinary cancers during the past 
30 years.
METHODS: We extracted data of kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 database, including incidence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and attributable risk factors from 1990 
to 2019. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) were calculated to assess 
the changes in age-standardized incidence rate, age-standardized mortality rate 
(ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR). The associations between cancers 
burden and socio-demographic index (SDI) were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared with 1990, the global incident cases in 2019 were higher by 
154.78%, 123.34%, and 169.11% for kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers, 
respectively. During the 30-year study period, there was a downward trend in 
ASMR and ASDR for bladder cancer (EAPC = - 0.68 and - 0.83, respectively) and 
prostate cancer (EAPC = - 0.75 and - 0.71, respectively), but an upward trend 
for kidney cancer (EAPC = 0.35 and 0.12, respectively). Regions and countries 
with higher SDI had higher incidence, mortality, and DALYs for all three types 
of cancers. The burden of bladder and prostate cancers was mainly distributed 
among older men, whereas the burden of kidney cancer increased among middle-aged 
men. Smoking related mortality and DALYs decreased, but high body mass index 
(BMI) and high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) related mortality and DALYs 
increased among kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, bladder, and prostate cancers remain major global public 
health challenges, but with distinct trend for different disease entity across 
different regions and socioeconomic status. More proactive intervention 
strategies, at both the administrative and academic levels, based on the dynamic 
changes, are needed.

BACKGROUND: The knowledge of the key factors associated with fertility desire 
among people living with HIV/AIDS is crucial for the efficient planning of 
maternal and child health care programs. Fertility desire has generally 
increased among women of reproductive age in Rwanda. However, its level and 
determinants among women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are currently not well 
known in the context of Rwanda. The present study aimed to fill in this 
knowledge gap.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the 2015 Rwanda demographic and health survey 
(RDHS) for 243 HIV-positive women of reproductive age. Univariate and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to identify 
the most influential factors.
RESULTS: The prevalence of desire to have another child in HIV-positive women 
was found to be as high as 40.7%. Multivariable logistic regression analyses 
showed that the woman's age of 35-49 years (AOR = 0.051, 95% CI: 0.013-0.204), 
woman's parity of 3 children or above (AOR = 0.177, 95% CI: 0.037-0.837), being 
employed (AOR = 0.298, 95% CI: 0.113-0.782) and currently using contraceptives 
(AOR = 0.146; 95% CI: 0.057-0.375) were significantly associated with low odds 
of fertility desire among HIV- positive women in Rwanda. Women younger than 
25 years, with no living child, or who were unemployed or who were not using any 
contraceptive were significantly associated with greater odds of desire to have 
another child than did other HIV- positive women. A woman whose partner's desire 
for children is different  from hers was associated with about four times higher 
odds (AOR = 3.752; 95% CI: 1.203-11.702) of desire for more children than women 
who desire the same as their partners.
CONCLUSION: Fertility desire in WLHA is currently high in Rwanda. It is 
significantly influenced by demographic and socioeconomic factors. The Rwanda's 
health care system should be prepared to intensify the required services for the 
prevention of the vertical transmission of HIV, the delivery of maternal and 
child health care services, and the support to WLHA in planning their fertility. 
Interventions should target low-parity young women, with a particular focus on 
meeting their contraceptive needs.

Global sea-level rise, the effect of climate change, poses a serious threat to 
rice production owing to saltwater intrusion and the accompanying increase in 
salt concentration. The reclaimed lands, comprising 22.1% of rice production in 
Korea, now face the crisis of global sea-level rise and a continuous increase in 
salt concentration. Here, we investigated the relationship between the decrease 
in seed quality and the transcriptional changes that occur in the developing 
rice seeds under salt stress. Compared to cultivation on normal land, the 
japonica rice cultivar, Samgwang, grown on reclaimed land showed a greatly 
increased accumulation of minerals, including sodium, magnesium, potassium, and 
sulfur, in seeds and a reduced yield, delayed heading, decreased thousand grain 
weight, and decreased palatability and amylose content. Samgwang showed 
phenotypical sensitivity to salt stress in the developing seeds. Using RNA-seq 
technology, we therefore carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis of the 
developing seeds grown on reclaimed and normal lands. In the biological process 
category, gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes 
were closely associated with the metabolism of biomolecules, including amino 
acids, carboxylic acid, lignin, trehalose, polysaccharide, and chitin, and to 
stress responses. MapMan analysis revealed the involvement of upregulated genes 
in the biosynthetic pathways of abscisic acid and melatonin and the relationship 
of trehalose, raffinose, and maltose with osmotic stress. Interestingly, many 
seed storage protein genes encoding glutelins and prolamins were upregulated in 
the developing seeds under salt stress, indicating the negative effect of the 
increase of storage proteins on palatability. Transcription factors upregulated 
in the developing seeds under salt stress included, in particular, bHLH, MYB, 
zinc finger, and heat shock factor, which could act as potential targets for the 
manipulation of seed quality under salt stress. Our study aims to develop a 
useful reference for elucidating the relationship between seed response 
mechanisms and decreased seed quality under salt stress, providing potential 
strategies for the improvement of seed quality under salt stress.

BACKGROUND: Health professionals' job satisfaction is crucial for health 
professionals' life which determines health care service quality. This study 
aimed to estimate pooled prevalence of job satisfaction of health professionals 
and associated factors in Ethiopia.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 
(PRISMA) was followed to prepare this study. Studies were searched from PubMed 
(EBSCOhost), Directory of open access journals (DOAJ), Global health, African 
Index Medicus, IRIS (WHO digital publication), African Journals Online (AJOL), 
Google Scholar, and Google. Random-effect model was used to estimate the pooled 
prevalence of job satisfaction and associated factors. Heterogeneity was 
assessed using I 2 test statistics. Publication bias was checked using funnel 
plot, Egger's regression test, and sensitivity analysis.
RESULT: The pooled prevalence of health professionals' job satisfaction was 
computed from 35 studies, and it was 46.68% (95%, confidence interval (CI): 
41.82, 51.54, I 2 = 95.8%). Specifically, job satisfaction was 57.56%, 48.80%, 
48.57%, 48.48%, 44.56%, 39.20%, and 16.5% among pharmacy professionals, health 
officers, midwives, nurses, anesthetists, physicians, and health extension 
workers, respectively. Secured working environment (pooled odds ratio 
[POR] = 6.50, 95% CI: 3.41-9.58), coworkers relationship (POR = 5.14, 95% CI: 
1.27, 9.02), good relationship with supervisors (POR = 5.86, 95% CI: 2.56-9.16) 
and having bachelor's degree (POR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.31, 3.72) were significantly 
associated with job satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Job satisfaction among Ethiopian health professionals is 
considerably low. Secured working environment, positive relationships among 
staff, and having a bachelor's enhanced the job satisfaction. Designing 
strategies to improve safety in the work environment and improved communication 
among workers could improve job satisfaction.

To reflect human development, it is critical to create a substrate that can 
support long-term cell survival, differentiation, and maturation. Hydrogels are 
promising materials for 3D cultures. However, a bulk structure consisting of 
dense polymer networks often leads to suboptimal microenvironments that impedes 
nutrient exchange and cell-to-cell interaction. Herein, granular hydrogel-based 
scaffolds were used to support 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(hiPSC)-derived neural networks. A custom designed 3D printed toolset was 
developed to extrude hyaluronic acid hydrogel through a porous nylon fabric to 
generate hydrogel granules. Cells and hydrogel granules were combined using a 
weaker secondary gelation step, forming self-supporting cell laden scaffolds. At 
three and seven days, granular scaffolds supported higher cell viability 
compared to bulk hydrogels, whereas granular scaffolds supported more neurite 
bearing cells and longer neurite extensions (65.52 ± 11.59 μm) after seven days 
compared to bulk hydrogels (22.90 ± 4.70 μm). Long-term (three-month) cultures 
of clinically relevant hiPSC-derived neural cells in granular hydrogels 
supported well established neuronal and astrocytic colonies and a high level of 
neurite extension both inside and beyond the scaffold. This approach is 
significant as it provides a simple, rapid and efficient way to achieve a 
tissue-relevant granular structure within hydrogel cultures.

Fertilizers and microbial communities that determine fertilizer efficiency are 
key to sustainable agricultural development. Sugarcane is an important sugar 
cash crop in China, and using bio-fertilizers is important for the sustainable 
development of China's sugar industry. However, information on the effects of 
bio-fertilizers on sugarcane soil microbiota has rarely been studied. In this 
study, the effects of bio-fertilizer application on rhizosphere soil 
physicochemical indicators, microbial community composition, function, and 
network patterns of sugarcane were discussed using a high-throughput sequencing 
approach. The experimental design is as follows: CK: urea application 
(57 kg/ha), CF: compound fertilizer (450 kg/ha), BF1: bio-fertilizer (1500 kg/ha 
of bio-fertilizer + 57 kg/ha of urea), and BF2: bio-fertilizer (2250 kg/ha of 
bio-fertilizer + 57 kg/ha of urea). The results showed that the bio-fertilizer 
was effective in increasing sugarcane yield by 3-12% compared to the CF 
treatment group, while reducing soil acidification, changing the diversity of 
fungi and bacteria, and greatly altering the composition and structure of the 
inter-root microbial community. Variance partitioning canonical correspondence 
(VPA) analysis showed that soil physicochemical variables explained 80.09% and 
73.31% of the variation in bacteria and fungi, respectively. Redundancy analysis 
and correlation heatmap showed that soil pH, total nitrogen, and available 
potassium were the main factors influencing bacterial community composition, 
while total soil phosphorus, available phosphorus, pH, and available nitrogen 
were the main drivers of fungal communities. Volcano plots showed that using 
bio-fertilizers contributed to the accumulation of more beneficial bacteria in 
the sugarcane rhizosphere level and the decline of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., 
Leifsonia), which may slow down or suppress the occurrence of diseases. Linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) and effect size analysis (LEfSe) searched for 
biomarkers under different fertilizer treatments. Meanwhile, support vector 
machine (SVM) assessed the importance of the microbial genera contributing to 
the variability between fertilizers, of interest were the bacteria 
Anaerolineace, Vulgatibacter, and Paenibacillus and the fungi Cochliobolus, 
Sordariales, and Dothideomycetes between CF and BF2, compared to the other 
genera contributing to the variability. Network analysis (co-occurrence network) 
showed that the network structure of bio-fertilizers was closer to the network 
characteristics of healthy soils, indicating that bio-fertilizers can improve 
soil health to some extent, and therefore if bio-fertilizers can be used as an 
alternative to chemical fertilizers in the future alternative, it is important 
to achieve green soil development and improve the climate.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a major health issue worldwide, as 
patients with T2DM show an excess risk of death for cardiovascular causes, twice 
as high as the general population. Among the many complications of T2DM, heart 
failure (HF) deserves special consideration as one of the leading causes of 
morbidity and reduced life expectancy. T2DM has been associated with different 
phenotypes of HF, including HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can evaluate the metabolic and 
ventilatory alterations related to myocardial dysfunction and/or peripheral 
impairment, representing a unique tool for the clinician to study the whole HF 
spectrum. While CPET allows for a thorough evaluation of functional capacity, it 
cannot directly differentiate central and peripheral determinants of effort 
intolerance. Combining CPET with imaging techniques could provide even higher 
accuracy and further insights into the progression of the disease since signs of 
left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction can be detected during 
exercise, even in asymptomatic diabetic individuals. This review aims to dissect 
the alterations in cardiopulmonary function characterising patients with T2DM 
and HF to improve patient risk stratification.

OBJECTIVE: Medical devices can offer important therapeutic advances but, as for 
any medical interventions, there are questions about their costs and benefits. 
We examined health benefits and costs for pre-market approved (PMA) devices 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1999-2015), grouping them 
by generic category (e.g., drug-eluting stents) and indication.
METHODS: We searched PubMed for incremental health gain estimates [measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and incremental costs for each device 
category compared to previously available treatments. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios by dividing the average incremental costs by the 
average incremental QALY gains. In sensitivity analysis, we repeated the 
analysis when excluding industry-funded studies.
RESULTS: We identified at least one relevant cost-utility or 
comparative-effectiveness study for 88 devices (15.9% of non-cosmetic devices 
approved from 1999 to 2015), and at least one device across 53 (26.2%) generic 
categories. The median (mean) incremental cost across generic device categories 
was $1701 ($13,320). The median (mean) incremental health gain across generic 
device categories was 0.13 (0.46) QALYs. We found that cost-effectiveness ratios 
for 36 of 53 (68%) and 43 of 53 (81%) device categories fell below (were more 
favorable than) $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY, respectively. Results were 
roughly similar when we excluded industry-funded studies.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that roughly one-quarter of the major PMA medical device 
categories have published cost-effectiveness evidence accessible through a 
large, publicly available database. Available evidence suggests that devices 
generally offer good value, as judged relative to established cost-effectiveness 
benchmarks.

PURPOSE: Advanced targeted therapy has resulted in increasing life expectancy 
and incidence of age-related cardiovascular diseases like atrial fibrillation in 
patients with haemophilia. Oral anticoagulation constitutes a significant 
dilemma in this patient category as the risks of stroke and bleeding are 
difficult to balance. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of left atrial 
appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients with haemophilia and atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: All patients with haemophilia treated with LAAO at Aarhus University 
Hospital, Denmark, were identified from a local prospective database comprising 
all consecutive LAAO procedures from 2010 up to November 2020. Based on review 
of the medical records, a retrospective descriptive analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Seven patients with haemophilia A and atrial fibrillation underwent 
LAAO after multidisciplinary conference. Peri-procedural coagulation management 
was guided by factor VIII activity and treated with repeated bolus 
administrations of recombinant factor VIII targeting an activity of 100%. The 
implantation was successful in all patients with only minor bleeding 
complications post-procedurally. Based on these experiences, a suggested regime 
has been formulated.
CONCLUSIONS: LAAO is feasible in haemophilia patients with concurrent atrial 
fibrillation. However, special care including intravenous substitution with 
coagulation factors must be given in the periprocedural management.

Due to mining activities, concentration of uranium (U) in the environment nearby 
former and operating sites can be higher than in other areas. The derivation of 
quality criteria for U in freshwater ecosystems, rivers and lakes includes the 
consideration of contaminated sediments and the associated risk to the benthic 
life. Therefore, the derivation of a quality criteria for sediment has been 
viewed as a logical and necessary extension of the work already done to 
establish water quality criteria. In order to contribute to the determination of 
a Quality Standard for sediment (QSsediment) according to the European 
recommendations, this study focuses on the acquisition of a new toxicity 
dataset, to enrich the few rare existing data, most often unsuitable. A basic 
set of organisms, including three complementary benthic organisms (Chironomus 
riparius, Hyalella azteca, Myriophyllum aquaticum), was chronically exposed to U 
spiked to a standard laboratory-formulated sediment, according to the related 
bioassay guidelines (ISO/FDIS16303, OECD 218/9, ISO/DIS 16191). We looked to 
determine when possible both NOEC and EC10 values for each organism. For C. 
riparius, a NOEC (emergence rate) value was estimated at 62 mgU, kg-1, dm and 
the EC10 value reached 188 mgU, kg-1, dm (CI95% 40-885 mgU kg-1, dm). For H. 
azteca, a NOEC (survival rate) value of 40 mgU kg-1, dm was observed while the 
EC10 value at 296 mgU kg-1, dm (CI95% = 155-436 mgU kg-1, dm) was slightly 
higher than for growth at 199 mgU kg-1, dm (CI95% = 107-291 mgU kg-1 dm). 
Finally, the less sensitive organism seemed to be the plant, M. aquaticum, for 
which we determined a NOEC value of 100 mgU kg-1, dm. Results obtained regarding 
the toxicity of U made it possible to suggest a preliminary QSsediment value of 
4 mgU kg-1, dry mass. This value was shown conservative compared to U sediment 
quality criteria derived by other jurisdictions.

Objective: Radiotherapy is one of the standard treatments for pelvic malignant 
tumors. However, researches associated with intestinal radiation injury and the 
quality of life (QoL) of patients receiving radiotherapy were lacking in the 
past. This study aims to analyze the occurrence of radiation-induced rectal 
injury after adjuvant radiotherapy for pelvic malignant tumors and call for more 
attention on this issne. Methods: A retrospectively observational study was 
conducted. Case data of cervical cancer patients from the database of STARS 
phase 3 randomized clinical trial (NCT00806117) in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer 
Center were analyzed. A total of 848 cervical cancer patients who received 
adjuvant radiation following hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy in Sun 
Yat-sen University Cancer Center from February 2008 to August 2015 were 
recruited. The pelvic radiation dosage was 1.8 Gy/day or 2.0 Gy/day, five times 
every week, and the total dosage was 40-50 Gy. Among 848 patients, 563 patients 
received radiation six weeks after surgery, of whom 282 received adjuvant 
radiation alone and 281 received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (weekly 
cisplatin); other 285 patients received sequential chemoradiotherapy (paclitaxel 
and cisplatin). Acute adverse events, chronic radiation damage of rectum, and
