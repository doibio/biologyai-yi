BACKGROUND: Therapeutic advancements following the introduction of autologous 
stem cell transplantation and 'novel' agents have significantly improved 
clinical outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Increased life 
expectancy, however, has led to renewed concerns about the long-term risk of 
second primary malignancies (SPMs). This review outlines the most up-to-date 
knowledge of possible host-, disease-, and treatment-related risk factors for 
the development of SPMs in patients with MM, and provides practical 
recommendations to assist physicians.
DESIGN: A Panel of International Myeloma Working Group members reviewed the most 
relevant data published in the literature as full papers, or presented at 
meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society of 
Hematology, European Hematology Association, or International Myeloma Workshops, 
up to June 2016. Here, we present the recommendations of the Panel, based on 
this literature review.
RESULTS: Overall, the risk of SPMs in MM is low, multifactorial, and partially 
related to the length of patients' survival and MM intrinsic susceptibility. 
Studies suggest a significantly increased incidence of SPMs when lenalidomide is 
administered either following, or concurrently with, oral melphalan. Increased 
SPM incidence has also been reported with lenalidomide maintenance following 
high-dose melphalan, albeit to a lesser degree. In both cases, the risk of death 
from MM was significantly higher than the risk of death from SPMs, with 
lenalidomide possibly providing a survival benefit. No increase in SPM incidence 
was reported with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (without melphalan), or with 
bortezomib plus oral melphalan, dexamethasone, or thalidomide.
CONCLUSION: In general, the risk of SPMs should not alter the current 
therapeutic decision-making process in MM. However, regimens such as 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone should be preferred to prolonged exposure to 
lenalidomide plus oral melphalan. SPM risk should be carefully discussed with 
the patient in the context of benefits and risks of different treatment options.

BACKGROUND: Regorafenib and TAS-102 have recently demonstrated statistically 
significant survival gains in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC). Life expectancy ≥12 weeks was an inclusion criterion in 
registrative trials, and the identification of proper clinical selection tools 
for the daily use of these drugs in heavily pre-treated patients is needed to 
improve the cost-benefit ratio. We aimed at building a nomogram able to predict 
death probability within 12 weeks from the date of assessment of refractory 
mCRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eleven refractory mCRC patients with ECOG 
performance status (PS) ≤2 receiving regorafenib, TAS-102 or other treatments 
were used as developing set. Putative prognostic variables were selected using a 
random forest model and included in a binary logistic model from which the 
nomogram was developed. The nomogram was externally validated and its 
performance was evaluated by examining calibration (how close predictions were 
to the actual outcome) and discriminative ability (Harrell C index) both on 
developing (internal validation) and validating (external validation) sets.
RESULTS: Four variables were selected and included in the nomogram: PS 
(P < 0.0001), primary tumor resection (P = 0.027), LDH value (P = 0.0001) and 
peritoneal involvement (P = 0.081). In the developing set, the nomogram 
discriminative ability was high (C = 0.778), and was confirmed in the validating 
set (C = 0.778), where the overall outcome was better as a consequence of the 
enrichment in patients receiving regorafenib or TAS-102 (46% versus 34%; 
P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram may be a useful tool to predict the probability of 
death within 12 weeks in patients with refractory mCRC. Based on four 
easy-to-collect variables, the 'Colon Life' nomogram and free app for 
smartphones may improve mCRC patients' selection for later-line therapies and 
assist researchers for the enrollment in clinical trials in this setting.

OBJECTIVES: Postnatal maternal mental health problems, including depression and 
anxiety, entail a significant burden globally, and finding cost-effective 
preventive solutions is a public policy priority. This paper presents a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention, What Were We Thinking (WWWT), 
for the prevention of postnatal maternal mental health problems.
DESIGN: The economic evaluation, including cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
analyses, was conducted alongside a cluster-randomised trial.
SETTING: 48 Maternal and Child Health Centres in Victoria, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were English-speaking first-time mothers attending 
participating Maternal and Child Health Centres. Full data were collected for 
175 participants in the control arm and 184 in the intervention arm.
INTERVENTION: WWWT is a psychoeducational intervention targeted at the partner 
relationship, management of infant behaviour and parental fatigue.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The evaluation considered public sector plus participant 
out-of-pocket costs, while outcomes were expressed in the 30-day prevalence of 
depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Incremental costs and outcomes were estimated using regression analyses 
to account for relevant sociodemographic, prognostic and clinical 
characteristics.
RESULTS: The intervention was estimated to cost $A118.16 per participant. The 
analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention 
and control groups in costs or outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were $A36 451 per QALY gained and $A152 per percentage-point reduction in 
30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. The estimate 
lies under the unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold of $A55 000 per QALY; 
however, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the results, with a 55% 
probability that WWWT would be considered cost-effective at that threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, although WWWT shows promise as a 
preventive intervention for postnatal maternal mental health problems, further 
research is required to reduce the uncertainty over its cost-effectiveness as 
there were no statistically significant differences in costs or outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter prospective clinical study was to 
evaluate anodized tapered implants with a conical connection and integrated 
platform shifting placed in the anterior and premolar maxilla.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled patients requiring single-tooth 
restorations in healed sites of maxillary anterior and premolar teeth. All 
implants were immediately temporized. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were 
conducted at implant insertion, 6 months, and 1 year. Outcome measures included 
bone remodeling, cumulative survival rate (CSR), success rate, soft-tissue 
health and esthetics, and patient satisfaction. Bone remodeling and pink 
esthetic score were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. CSR was 
calculated using life table analysis. Other soft-tissue outcomes were analyzed 
using sign tests.
RESULTS: Out of 97 enrolled patients (102 implants), 87 patients (91 implants) 
completed the 1-year visit. Marginal bone remodeling was -0.85 ± 1.36 mm. After 
the expected initial bone loss, a mean bone gain of 0.11 ± 1.05 mm was observed 
between 6 months and 1 year. The CSR was 99.0%, and the cumulative success rate 
was 97.0%. Partial or full papilla was observed at 30.8% of sites at baseline, 
87.2% at 6 months, and 90.5% at 1 year. Soft-tissue response, esthetics, and 
patient satisfaction all improved during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Bone gain was observed following the expected initial bone loss, 
and soft-tissue outcomes improved suggesting favorable tissue response using 
anodized tapered conical connection implants.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Rapid stabilization of bone remodeling and robust papilla 
regeneration indicate favorable tissue healing promoted by the conical 
connection, platform-shift design.

Background Advances in the treatment of HIV infection have enabled better 
control of the disease, allowing patients to enjoy a longer life expectancy. 
However, the ageing of patients leads to an increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease. Various studies have found that pharmaceutical care 
results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To measure 
the impact of pharmaceutical care on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 
50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Setting Outpatient 
pharmacy service of a tertiary hospital, Spain. Methods A pre/post-intervention 
quasi-experimental clinical study was conducted in which health education and 
pharmacist interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors were carried out 
in a single patient cohort using the Dader method of pharmacotherapy, with a 
12-month follow-up period per patient. Patients included were older than 50 
years, with moderate/elevated cardiovascular risk. Data were obtained from 
patient clinical histories, dispensing records and patient interviews, and were 
subjected to statistical analysis. Main outcome measure Cardiovascular risk 
estimated by SCORE and REGICOR equations. Results Forty-two patients completed 
the study. Of these, 93 % were men, with an average age of 57 years and 15 years 
since diagnosis of HIV. A reduction was observed in the mean values (baseline 
vs. 12 months) of the following cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood 
pressure (P = 0.009), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010), total cholesterol 
(P = 0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; P = 0.039), 
triglycerides (P = 0.010) and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-c; P < 0.001). An increase in HDL-c (P = 0.037) was also 
observed. The average cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE instrument was 
reduced from 7.6 % at the beginning of the study to 6.4 % after 12 months (P = 
0.039). The risk estimate according to REGICOR also decreased (P = 0.002). Over 
the 12-month period, 6.3 ± 3.4 interventions were carried out per patient. 
Quantitative ineffectiveness was the most prevalent negative outcome associated 
with medication throughout the study, and noncompliance was the most frequent 
cause. Interventions on health education were the most common, followed by 
interventions on improving adherence. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care, delivered 
as a combination of health education and pharmacotherapy follow-up to 
outpatients at a tertiary hospital, had a positive impact on cardiovascular risk 
in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy.

Two cases of occult pseudoaneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva (SoV) are reported 
to demonstrate different etiologies and lethal mechanisms. A previously well 
9-month-old boy who suffered an unexpected fatal cardiorespiratory arrest was 
found at autopsy to have a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the left SoV resulting in 
lethal hemopericardium. A 13.5-month-old boy died soon after presenting with a 
24-h history of poor feeding and reduced urine output. At autopsy, destruction 
of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve by bacterial endocarditis was found 
with extension of the inflammation into a pseudoaneurysm of the SoV with 
surrounding abscess formation involving the atrioventricular node. Death was 
most likely due to an arrhythmia. Pseudoaneurysms of the SoV are exceedingly 
rare but may result in sudden/unexpected death in infancy and early childhood 
from rupture or involvement of the conduction system or myocardium. Detailed 
cardiac examination is essential in all unexpected deaths in early life.

OBJECTIVE: this study aims to identify the aetiological relationships of 
psychosocial factors in postnatal traumatic symptoms among Japanese primiparas 
and multiparas.
DESIGN: a longitudinal, observational survey.
SETTING: participants were recruited at three institutions in Tokyo, Japan 
between April 2013 and May 2014. Questionnaires were distributed to 464 Japanese 
women in late pregnancy (> 32 gestational weeks, Time 1), on the third day (Time 
2) and one month (Time 3) postpartum.
MEASUREMENTS: The Japanese Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire 
(JW-DEQ) version A was used to measure antenatal fear of childbirth and social 
support, while the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) measured traumatic 
stress symptoms due to childbirth.
FINDINGS: of the 464 recruited, 427 (92%) completed questionnaires at Time 1, 
358 (77%) completed at Time 2, and 248 (53%) completed at Time 3. Total 238 
(51%) were analysed. A higher educational level has been identified in analysed 
group (p=0.021) Structural equation modelling was conducted separately for 
primiparas and multiparas and exhibited a good fit. In both groups antenatal 
fear of childbirth predicted Time 2 postnatal traumatic symptoms (β=0.33-0.54, 
p=0.002-0.007). Antenatal fear of childbirth was associated with a history of 
mental illness (β=0.23, p=0.026) and lower annual income (β =-0.24, p=0.018). 
Among multiparas, lower satisfaction with a previous delivery was related to 
antenatal fear of childbirth (β =-0.28, p < 0.001).
KEY CONCLUSIONS: antenatal fear of childbirth was a significant predictor of 
traumatic stress symptoms after childbirth among both primiparous and 
multiparous women. Fear of childbirth was predicted by a history of mental 
illness and lower annual income for primiparous women, whereas previous birth 
experiences were central to multiparous women.
IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: the association between antenatal fear of childbirth 
and postnatal traumatic symptoms indicates the necessity of antenatal care. It 
may be important to take account of the background of primiparous women, such as 
a history of mental illness and their attitude towards the upcoming birth. For 
multiparous women, focusing on and helping them to view their previous birth 
experiences in a more positive light are vital tasks for midwives.

Shorter lives in stingier states: Social policy shortcomings help explain the US 
mortality disadvantage.

Beckfield J(1), Bambra C(2).

The United States has a mortality disadvantage relative to its political and 
economic peer group of other rich democracies. Recently it has been suggested 
that there could be a role for social policy in explaining this disadvantage. In 
this paper, we test this "social policy hypothesis" by presenting a time-series 
cross-section analysis from 1970 to 2010 of the association between welfare 
state generosity (for unemployment insurance, sickness benefits, and pensions) 
and life expectancy, for the US and 17 other high-income countries. 
Fixed-effects estimation with autocorrelation-corrected standard errors (robust 
to unmeasured between-country differences and serial autocorrelation of repeated 
measures) found strong associations between welfare generosity and life 
expectancy. A unit increase in overall welfare generosity yields a 0.17 year 
increase in life expectancy at birth (p < 0.001), and a 0.07 year increase in 
life expectancy at age 65 (p < 0.001). The strongest effects of the welfare 
state are in the domain of pension benefits (b = 0.439 for life expectancy at 
birth, p < 0.001; b = 0.199 for life expectancy at age 65, p < 0.001). Models 
that lag the measures of social policy by ten years produce similar results, 
suggesting that the results are not driven by endogeneity bias. There is 
evidence that the US mortality disadvantage is, in part, a welfare-state 
disadvantage. We estimate that life expectancy in the US would be approximately 
3.77 years longer, if it had just the average social policy generosity of the 
other 17 OECD nations.

This study was undertaken to develop and cross-validate reference and individual 
predictive models for estimating functional thigh muscle cross-sectional area 
(TCSA) by 2-point Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TCSAs of dominant 
sides at the mid-thigh level were measured by 2-point Dixon MRI (MRITCSA). 
Functional MRITCSA were compared with the predictive models in a sample of 92 
younger (20-40 years; 28.55±4.87; n=50) and older (>65years; 71.22±4.82; n=42) 
Koreans. Lean body masses were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXALBM), and thigh isokinetic muscle strengths, extension peak torque at 
60°/sec, were measured using a Biodex® dynamometer (BiodexEPT). Multiple 
regression analysis generated the reference model (R2=0.75 and SEE=1472.63mm2 
(8%)) as follows: The reference model: functional 
TCSA(mm2)=-1230.49+62.81*height+3061.78*gender -2692.57*age+58.91*weight. The 
individual model (R2=0.80, SEE=1158.34mm2 (7%)) was as follows: The individual 
model: functional TCSA(mm2)=1631.62+1.76* DXALBM+9.51*BiodexEPT where height is 
in centimeters; weight is in kilograms; for gender, female=0 and male=1; and for 
age, age under 40=1 and age over 65=2. PRESS statistics of R2 and SEE were 0.78 
and 1382.98mm2 for the reference model, and 0.88 and 979.02mm2 for the 
individual model. The 2-point Dixon MRI appears to be valid for measuring 
functional muscle size. Our results suggest that the reference and individual 
models provide acceptable estimates of functional thigh muscle CSA in healthy 
Korean adults. Therefore, the models developed in the study could be useful as a 
research tool to establish indexes for functional muscle composition in healthy 
Koreans.

We report a case of symptomatic subluxation of the semitendinosus and gracilis 
over the medial condyle of the tibia caused by the thickening of its tendons. 
Snapping was reproduced on active extension. Clinical examination and, above 
all, dynamic ultrasound were the key for the diagnosis because other imaging 
tests were normal. Due to failure of conservative treatment with physiotherapy 
and infiltrations, surgery was undertaken, involving desinsertion and excision 
of distal 8cm segment of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. At the present 
time (6 months postoperatively), the patient is symptom-free and has returned to 
the previous normal life activities.

The diagnosis of central airway tumors is usually challenging because of the 
vague presentations. Advances in visualization technology in bronchoscopy aid 
early detection of bronchial lesion. Cryotechnology has great impact on 
endobronchial lesion sampling and provides better diagnostic yield. Airway tumor 
involvements result in significant alteration in life quality and lead to poor 
life expectancy. Timely and efficiently use ablation techniques by heat or cold 
energy provide symptoms relief for central airway obstruction. Prostheses 
implantation is effective in maintaining airway patency after ablative procedure 
or external compression. Combined interventional bronchoscopy modalities and 
other adjunctive therapies have improvement in quality of life and further 
benefit in survival. This review aims to provide a diagnostic approach to 
central airway tumors and an overview of currently available techniques of 
interventional bronchoscopy in managing symptomatic central airway obstruction.

Neurological Change after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases 
Involving the Motor Cortex.

Medicine, Suwon, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Although Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) can provide beneficial 
therapeutic effects for patients with brain metastases, lesions involving the 
eloquent areas carry a higher risk of neurologic deterioration after treatment, 
compared to those located in the non-eloquent areas. We aimed to investigate 
neurological change of the patients with brain metastases involving the motor 
cortex (MC) and the relevant factors related to neurological deterioration after 
GKRS.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical, radiological and dosimetry data 
of 51 patients who underwent GKRS for 60 brain metastases involving the MC. 
Prior to GKRS, motor deficits existed in 26 patients (50.9%). The mean target 
volume was 3.2 cc (range 0.001-14.1) at the time of GKRS, and the mean 
prescription dose was 18.6 Gy (range 12-24 Gy).
RESULTS: The actuarial median survival time from GKRS was 19.2±5.0 months. The 
calculated local tumor control rates at 6 and 12 months after GKRS were 89.7% 
and 77.4%, respectively. During the median clinical follow-up duration of 
12.3±2.6 months (range 1-54 months), 18 patients (35.3%) experienced new or 
worsened neurologic deficits with a median onset time of 2.5±0.5 months (range 
0.3-9.7 months) after GKRS. Among various factors, prescription dose (>20 Gy) 
was a significant factor for the new or worsened neurologic deficits in 
univariate (p=0.027) and multivariate (p=0.034) analysis. The managements of 18 
patients were steroid medication (n=10), boost radiation therapy (n=5), and 
surgery (n=3), and neurological improvement was achieved in 9 (50.0%).
CONCLUSION: In our series, prescription dose (>20 Gy) was significantly related 
to neurological deterioration after GKRS for brain metastases involving the MC. 
Therefore, we suggest that careful dose adjustment would be required for lesions 
involving the MC to avoid neurological deterioration requiring additional 
treatment in the patients with limited life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how health advice is provided in popular magazines and the 
quality of that advice.
METHODS: A prospective quantitative analysis of the quality of health advice 
provided in Australian magazines between July and December 2011 was conducted. A 
rating instrument was adapted from the Media Doctor Australia rating tool used 
to assess quality of health news reporting. Criteria included: recommends seeing 
a doctor; advice based on reliable evidence; advice clear and easily applied; 
benefits presented meaningfully; potential harms mentioned; evidence of disease 
mongering; availability and cost of treatments; obvious advertising; vested 
interest, and anecdotal evidence.
RESULTS: 163 health advice articles were rated showing a wide variation in the 
quality of advice presented between magazines. Magazines with 'health' in the 
title, rated most poorly with only 36% (26/73) of these articles presenting 
clear and meaningful advice and 52% (38/73) giving advice based on reliable 
evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Australian magazines, especially those with health in the title, 
generally presented poor quality, unreliable health advice. Teen magazine Dolly 
provided the highest quality advice.
IMPLICATIONS: Consumers need to be aware of this when making health choices.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term benefit of providing a post-acute, 
outpatient group exercise program for patients following primary total knee 
replacement (TKR) surgery for osteoarthritis.
METHODS: A multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted in 12 Australian 
public and private hospital centers. A total of 422 participants, ages 45-75 
years, were randomly allocated prior to hospital discharge to the post-acute 
group exercise program or to usual care and were assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, 
and 12 months after surgery. The main outcomes were operated knee pain and 
activity limitations at 12 months using the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included 
health-related quality of life (Short Form 12 health survey), knee extension and 
flexion strength, stair-climb power, 50-foot walk speed, and active knee range 
of motion.
RESULTS: While both allocation groups achieved significant improvements in knee 
pain and activity limitations over the 12-month followup period, there were no 
significant differences in these main outcomes, or in the secondary physical 
performance measures, between the 2 treatment allocations. Twelve months after 
TKR, 69% and 72% of participants allocated to post-acute exercise and usual 
acute care, respectively, were considered to be treatment-responders. While 
population normative values for self-report measures of pain, activity 
limitation, and health-related quality of life were attained 12 months after 
TKR, marked deficits in physical performance measures remained.
CONCLUSION: Providing access to a post-acute group exercise program did not 
result in greater reductions in long-term knee pain or activity limitations than 
usual care. Patients undergoing primary TKR retain marked physical performance 
deficits 12 months after surgery.

Effects of environmental exposures in utero and in the first years of life on 
early life health and development is a growing research area with major public 
health implications. The main aim of this work has been to provide an overview 
of the next step of the Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study (REPRO_PL) covering 
exposure, health and neurodevelopment assessments of children at 7 years of age. 
Details regarding methodology of the follow-up of the children are crucial for 
cross-cohort collaboration and a full understanding of the future research 
questions. Phase III of the REPRO_PL cohort covers a follow-up of 900 children 
at the age of 7 years old. The questionnaire filled in by the mothers is 
composed of: socio-demographic, child exposure and home environment information, 
nutritional status and health data. In the case of 400 children, environmental 
(including collection of urine, saliva and buccal cells), health status and 
psychomotor assessments are performed. Health and development check consists of 
physical measurements, child health status assessment (including lung function 
tests, skin prick testing, an interview/examination by an allergist) and 
psychomotor development tests (the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and 
the Intelligence and Development Scales). The results of the study will become 
available within the next few years. Extension of the REPRO_PL cohort with 
examinations of children at the age of 7 years old may provide a better 
understanding of the relationship between environmental and lifestyle-related 
factors and children's health and neurodevelopment; and may further strengthen 
scientific base for policies and interventions promoting healthy lifestyle. Int

INTRODUCTION: Suicides are one of the main public health issues 
globally. Objective: To analyze the trends and impact of suicide mortality in 
Colombia and México between 2000 and 2013, nationally, by sex and age 
groups. Materials and methods: Mortality vital statistics from the Colombian 
Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística and the Mexican Instituto 
Nacional de Estadística y Geografía were used. We conducted a descriptive and 
cross sectional study for which we calculated standardized mortality rates and 
years of life lost in people between 0 and 100 years of age. Results: In 
Colombia, the suicide mortality rate decreased between 2000 and 2013 for both 
sexes (28% for men and 38% for women); an opposite trend was observed in México 
(with an increase of 34% for males and 67% for females). In 2013, the years of 
life lost in Colombia were 0,32 among men and 0,15 among women, with a 
decreasing trend since 2000, whereas in México a level of 0,42 was observed in 
men and 0,2 in women, with an increasing trend since 2000. The age groups where 
suicides had a bigger impact were those of men 15 to 49 years of age in both 
countries, while suicides were more uniformly distributed among women between 15 
and 84 years of age.
CONCLUSION:  Suicide mortality increased gradually in México, whereas in 
Colombia an opposite trend was observed. Suicides can be prevented, so it is 
fundamental to implement public health policies focused on timely 
identification, comprehensive prevention strategies and the study of associated 
risk factors.

A new quencher-free Hg2+ ion assay method was developed based on 
polymerase-assisted photoinduced electron transfer (PIET). In this approach, a 
probe is designed with a mercury ion recognition sequence (MRS) that is composed 
of two T-rich functional areas separated by a spacer of random bases at the 
3'-end, and a sequence of stacked cytosines at the 5'-end, to which a 
fluorescein (FAM) is attached. Upon addition of Hg2+ ions into this sensing 
system, the MRS folds into a hairpin structure at the 3'-end with Hg2+-mediated 
base pairs. In the presence of DNA polymerase, it will catalyze the extension 
reaction, resulting in the formation of stacked guanines, which will instantly 
quench the fluorescence of FAM through PIET. Under optimal conditions, the limit 
of detection for Hg2+ ions was estimated to be 5 nM which is higher than the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard limit. In addition, no labeling 
with a quencher was requiring, and the present method is fairly simple, fast and 
low cost. It is expected that this cost-effective fluorescence method might hold 
considerable potential in the detection of Hg2+ ions in real biological and 
environmental samples.

Aortic stenosis is one the most frequent valvular diseases in developed 
countries, and its impact on public healthcare resources and assistance is 
increasing. A substantial proportion of elderly patients with severe aortic 
stenosis is frequently not eligible for surgery because of advanced age, frailty 
and multiple comorbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) 
enables the treatment of very elderly patients at high or prohibitive surgical 
risk considered ineligible for surgery and with an acceptable life expectancy. 
However, a significant proportion of patients die or do not achieve an 
improvement of quality of life in the short to medium-term follow-up. It is 
important to determine: 1) whether and how much patient frailty influences the 
procedural risk; 2) whether quality of life and the individual patient survival 
are influenced by aortic valve disease alone or by other associated factors; 3) 
whether a geriatric specialist intervention to evaluate and correct other 
diseases with their potential or already evident disabilities can improve the 
results of TAVI, in particular patient quality of life. Consequently, in 
addition to risk stratification with conventional tools, a number of factors 
including multimorbidity, disability, frailty and cognitive function should be 
considered in order to assess the expected benefit of TAVI. Preoperative 
optimization through a multidisciplinary approach with a Heart Team can 
counteract the multiple damage (cardiac, neurological, muscular, respiratory, 
renal) that can potentially worsen the reduced physiological reserves 
characteristic of frailty. The systematic implementation into clinical practice 
of multidimensional assessment instruments of frailty and cognitive function for 
screening and exercise, and the adoption of specific care pathways should 
facilitate this task.

OBJECTIVE: to describe the burden of disease in Brazil from 1990 to 2010.
METHODS: analysis of the estimates of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 - 
Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality (YLL), Years Lost due to 
Disability (YLD), Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY=YLL+YLD) and risk factors.
RESULTS: there was a decrease in deaths due to diarrhea and an increase in 
deaths due to diabetes and kidney disease, whilst deaths due to homicides and 
traffic accidents remained stable; cardiovascular diseases continued to be the 
leading cause of death despite a 30% reduction; the largest increases in DALY 
were due to diabetes and musculoskeletal diseases in women and alcohol abuse and 
low back pain in men; the main risk factors were poor diet and high blood 
pressure; smoking, domestic pollution and insufficient breastfeeding were found 
to have reduced.
CONCLUSION: the rapid epidemiological transition highlights the need to control 
infectious diseases and invest in reducing violence and non-communicable 
diseases.
