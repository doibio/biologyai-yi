BACKGROUND: Understanding socioeconomic disparities in all-cause and 
cause-specific mortality can help inform prevention and treatment strategies.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify cause-specific mortality rates by socioeconomic status 
across seven health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) in five 
countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Nigeria) in the INDEPTH 
Network in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: We linked demographic residence data with household survey data 
containing living standards and education information we used to create a 
poverty index. Person-years lived and deaths between 2003 and 2016 (periods 
varied by HDSS) were stratified in each HDSS by age, sex, year, and number of 
deprivations on the poverty index (0-8). Causes of death were assigned to each 
death using the InterVA-4 model based on responses to verbal autopsy 
questionnaires. We estimated rate ratios between socioeconomic groups (2-4 and 
5-8 deprivations on our poverty index compared to 0-2 deprivations) for specific 
causes of death and calculated life expectancy for the deprivation groups.
RESULTS: Our pooled data contained almost 3.5 million person-years of 
observation and 25,038 deaths. All-cause mortality rates were higher among 
people in households with 5-8 deprivations on our poverty index compared to 0-2 
deprivations, controlling for age, sex, and year (rate ratios ranged 1.42 to 
2.06 across HDSS sites). The poorest group had consistently higher death rates 
in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions (rate ratios 
ranged 1.34-4.05) and for non-communicable diseases in several sites 
(1.14-1.93). The disparities in mortality between 5-8 deprivation groups and 0-2 
deprivation groups led to lower life expectancy in the higher-deprivation groups 
by six years in all sites and more than 10 years in five sites.
CONCLUSIONS: We show large disparities in mortality on the basis of 
socioeconomic status across seven HDSS in sub-Saharan Africa due to disparities 
in communicable disease mortality and from non-communicable diseases in some 
sites. Life expectancy gaps between socioeconomic groups within sites were 
similar to the gaps between high-income and lower-middle-income countries. 
Prevention and treatment efforts can benefit from understanding subpopulations 
facing higher mortality from specific conditions.

XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A), a key scaffold protein in 
nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, is important in DNA damage 
verification and repair proteins recruitment. Earlier studies had mapped the 
minimal DNA-binding domain (MBD) of XPA to a region corresponding to residues 
98-219. However, recent studies indicated that the region involving residues 
98-239 is the redefined DNA-binding domain (DBD), which binds to DNA substrates 
with a much higher binding affinity than MBD and possesses a nearly identical 
binding affinity to the full-length XPA protein. However, the structure of the 
redefined DBD domain of XPA (XPA-DBD) remains to be investigated. Here, we 
present the crystal structure of XPA-DBD at 2.06 Å resolution. Structure of the 
C-terminal region of XPA has been extended by 21 residues (Arg211-Arg231) as 
compared with previously reported MBD structures. The structure reveals that the 
C-terminal extension (Arg211-Arg231) is folded as an α-helix with multiple basic 
residues. The positively charged surface formed in the last C-terminal helix 
suggests its critical role in DNA binding. Further structural analysis 
demonstrates that the last C-terminal region (Asp217-Thr239) of XPA-DBD might 
undergo a conformational change to directly bind to the DNA substrates. This 
study provides a structural basis for understanding the possible mechanism of 
enhanced DNA-binding affinity of XPA-DBD.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the first three causes of cancer mortality in 
Europe. Screening in asymptomatic men (aged 55-69yr) using prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) is associated with a migration toward lower staged disease and a 
reduction in cancer-specific mortality. By 20yr after testing, around 100 men 
need to be screened to prevent one PCa death. While this ratio is smaller than 
for breast and colon cancer, the long natural history of PCa means many men die 
from other causes. As such, the nonselective use of PSA testing and radical 
treatments can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The European Association 
of Urology (EAU) supports measures to encourage appropriate PCa detection 
through PSA testing, while reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These goals 
may be achieved using personalized risk-stratified approaches. For diagnosis, 
the greatest benefit from early detection is likely to come in men assessed 
using baseline PSA levels at the age of 45yr to individualize screening 
intervals. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as well as risk 
calculators based on family history, ethnicity, digital rectal examination, and 
prostate volume should be considered to triage the need for biopsy, thus 
reducing the risk of overdiagnosis. For treatment, the EAU advocates balancing 
patient's life expectancy and cancer's mortality risk when deciding an approach. 
Active surveillance is encouraged in well-informed patients with low-risk and 
some intermediate-risk cancers, as it decreases the risks of overtreatment 
without compromising oncological outcomes. Conversely, the EAU advocates radical 
treatment in suitable men with more aggressive PCa. Multimodal treatment should 
be considered in locally advanced or high-grade cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: 
Implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening should be 
considered at a population level. Men at risk of prostate cancer should have a 
baseline PSA blood test (eg, at 45yr). The level of this test, combined with 
family history, ethnicity, and other factors, can be used to determine 
subsequent follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and novel biomarkers 
should be used to determine which men need biopsy and how any cancers should be 
treated.

The demographic aging in Cuba has caused considerable changes in mortality and 
morbidity; its growing trend and high speed affect the attention of the elderly, 
posing a challenge to public health. This article focuses on years 1950-2015, 
and aims to present the situation of this population phenomenon from a positive 
view, according to three aspects: aging as an achievement, challenge and 
development opportunity; demographic and epidemiological transitions; and 
policies and strategies to address aging. The general fertility rate has 
decreased from 4.01 to 1.45, and the life expectancy at birth and the life 
expectancy at third age have increased from 59.40 to 78.45 years and from 16.04 
to 22.58, respectively. The proportion of people aged 60 and over in Cuba 
amounts to 19.8%. Causes of morbidity and mortality have changed from infectious 
diseases to non-communicable diseases. In Cuba, aging is the result of a 
sustained reduction in fertility and mortality, and a negative migratory 
balance. The challenge of the dependency of the elderly person and the need for 
care is discussed. Although this demographic indicator represents an achievement 
and a development opportunity, population aging poses a challenge for 
development and public health, for which comprehensive and cross-sectional 
policies and strategies aimed at mitigating its negative effects have been 
established.

El envejecimiento demográfico en Cuba ha provocado cambios considerables en la 
mortalidad y la morbilidad; su tendencia creciente y alta velocidad comprometen 
la atención de la persona mayor, de ahí que sea un desafío para la salud 
pública. Este artículo, que abarca el período 1950-2015, tiene como finalidad 
exponer la situación de este fenómeno poblacional desde una visión positiva, 
según tres aspectos: el envejecimiento como logro, desafío y oportunidad de 
desarrollo; las transiciones demográfica y epidemiológica; y las políticas y 
estrategias para afrontarlo. La tasa general de fecundidad ha descendido desde 
4,01 hasta 1,45, y la esperanza de vida al nacer y la esperanza de vida a la 
tercera edad se han incrementado desde 59,40 hasta 78,45 años y desde 16,04 
hasta 22,58, respectivamente. La proporción de personas de 60 años o más en Cuba 
asciende a 19,8%. El cuadro de morbilidad y mortalidad ha cambiado de las 
enfermedades infectocontagiosas a las no transmisibles. El envejecimiento en 
Cuba se ha producido por la reducción sostenida de la fecundidad, la mortalidad 
y un saldo migratorio negativo. Se discute el reto que significa la dependencia 
de la persona mayor y la necesidad de cuidados que requiere. Además del logro y 
la oportunidad de desarrollo que representa este indicador demográfico, el 
envejecimiento poblacional constituye un desafío para el desarrollo y la salud 
pública, para el que se han establecido políticas y estrategias integrales e 
intersectoriales encaminadas a mitigar sus efectos negativos.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the correlations between 
objective performance-based physical function, self-reported physical function, 
quality of life, and gait function at 1 mo after unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 195 patients who underwent unilateral primary 
total knee arthroplasty were analyzed. The isometric knee extensor and flexor 
strength of both knees, gait parameters, 6-min walk test, timed up-and-go test, 
timed stair-climbing test, knee flexion and extension range of motion of 
surgical knee, Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, 
stiffness, and functional levels, EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire, and 
visual analog scale for knee pain were assessed.
RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, both postoperative gait speed and gait endurance 
had significant positive correlations with postoperative peak torque of the 
extensor and flexor of both knees, cadence, stride length, and significant 
negative correlation with timed up-and-go, stair-climbing test ascent, 
stair-climbing test descent, visual analog scale, Western Ontario McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, stiffness, and function levels. In the 
linear regression analyses, postoperative peak torque of the extensors of both 
knees and VAS for knee pain were factors correlated with postoperative gait 
speed and gait endurance.
CONCLUSIONS: Quadriceps muscle strength of both knees and knee pain were 
important factors correlated with gait function early after total knee 
arthroplasty.

Imaging Evaluation of Lung Transplantation Patients: A Time and Etiology-based 
Approach to High-resolution Computed Tomography Interpretation.

Lung transplantation is an established therapeutic option for patients with 
irreversible end-stage pulmonary disease limiting life expectancy and quality of 
life. Common indications for lung transplantation include chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary 
arterial hypertension, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Complications of lung 
transplantation can be broadly divided etiologically into surgical, infectious, 
immunologic, or neoplastic. Moreover, specific complications often occur within 
a certain time interval following surgery, which can be broadly classified as 
early (<6 wk), intermediate (6 wk to 6 mo), and late (>6 mo). Thus, each group 
of complications can further be categorized on the basis of the time continuum 
from transplantation. Imaging, primarily by high-resolution computed tomography, 
plays a critical role in early diagnosis of complications after lung 
transplantation. Early recognition of complications by the radiologist, and 
initiation of therapy, contributes to improved morbidity and mortality. However, 
accurate diagnosis is only feasible if one has a thorough understanding of the 
major etiologic categories of complications and how they relate to the time 
course since transplantation. We review imaging manifestations of lung 
transplant complications via a framework that includes the following major 
etiologic categories: surgical; infectious; immunologic; and neoplastic; and the 
following time frames: surgery to 6 weeks; 6 weeks to 6 months; and beyond 6 
months. We propose this approach as a logical, evidence-based algorithm to 
construct a narrow, optimal differential diagnosis of lung transplantation 
complications.

STUDY DESIGN: Markov model.
OBJECTIVE: Examine the 1-year effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (societal and 
payer perspectives) of adding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic low 
back pain (CLBP) to usual care using a decision analytic model-based approach.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Treatment guidelines now recommend many safe and 
effective nonpharmacologic interventions for CLBP. However, little is known 
regarding their effectiveness in subpopulations (e.g., high-impact chronic pain 
patients), nor about their cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: The model included four health states: high-impact chronic pain 
(substantial activity limitations); no pain; and two others without activity 
limitations, but with higher (moderate-impact) or lower (low-impact) pain. We 
estimated intervention-specific transition probabilities for these health states 
using individual patient-level data from 10 large randomized trials covering 17 
nonpharmacologic therapies. The model was run for nine 6-week cycles to 
approximate a 1-year time horizon. Quality-adjusted life-year weights were based 
on six-dimensional health state short form scores; healthcare costs were based 
on 2003 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data; and lost productivity 
costs used in the societal perspective were based on reported absenteeism. 
Results were generated for two target populations: (1) a typical baseline mix of 
patients with CLBP (25% low-impact, 35% moderate-impact, and 40% high-impact 
chronic pain) and (2) high-impact chronic pain patients.
RESULTS: From the societal perspective, all but two of the therapies were cost 
effective (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year) for a typical patient mix and 
most were cost saving. From the payer perspective fewer were cost saving, but 
the same number was cost-effective. Assuming all patients in the model have 
high-impact chronic pain increases the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
most, but not all, therapies indicating that substantial benefits are possible 
in this subpopulation.
CONCLUSION: Modeling leverages the evidence produced from clinical trials to 
provide more information than is available in the published studies. We 
recommend modeling for all existing studies of nonpharmacologic interventions 
for CLBP.

The date palm hopper, Ommatissus lybicus de Bergevin, is one of the most 
important pests of the date palm in the Middle East and North Africa. This 
insect uses its needle-like sucking mouthparts to feed on phloem, which is 
devoid of most essential amino acids and many vitamins. The absence of essential 
nutrient in its diet is suggested to be ameliorated by endosymbionts in O. 
lybicus. Arsenophonus is one of the main bacterial endosymbionts widely 
prevalent in O. lybicus. In this study, we used antibiotics to eliminate 
Arsenophonus from O. lybicus originating from three populations (Fin, Qale'e 
Qazi, and Roodan) and studied the effects on the fitness of the pest. Our 
results revealed that the removal of Arsenophonus increased the developmental 
time of the immature stages and reduced the values of different life-history 
parameters including nymphal survival rate and adult longevity in the host. 
Furthermore, elimination of Arsenophonus completely obliterated offspring 
production in all O. lybicus populations investigated. These results confirm the 
dependency of O. lybicus on Arsenophonus for fitness and give a new insight 
regarding the possibility of symbiotic control of O. lybicus.

INTRODUCTION: We describe the California Healthy Places Index (HPI) and its 
performance relative to other indexes for measuring community well-being at the 
census-tract level. The HPI arose from a need identified by health departments 
and community organizations for an index rooted in the social determinants of 
health for place-based policy making and program targeting. The index was 
geographically granular, validated against life expectancy at birth, and linked 
to policy actions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Guided by literature, public health experts, and a 
positive asset frame, we developed a composite index of community well-being for 
California from publicly available census-tract data on place-based factors 
linked to health. The 25 HPI indicators spanned 8 domains; weights were derived 
from their empirical association with tract-level life expectancy using weighted 
quantile sums methods.
RESULTS: The HPI's domains were aligned with the social determinants of health 
and policy action areas of economic resources, education, housing, 
transportation, clean environment, neighborhood conditions, social resources, 
and health care access. The overall HPI score was the sum of weighted domain 
scores, of which economy and education were highly influential (50% of total 
weights). The HPI was strongly associated with life expectancy at birth (r = 
0.58). Compared with the HPI, a pollution-oriented index did not capture 
one-third of the most disadvantaged quartile of census tracts (representing 3 
million Californians). Overlap of the HPI's most disadvantaged quartile of 
census tracts was greater for indexes of economic deprivation. We visualized the 
HPI percentile ranking as a web-based mapping tool that presented the HPI at 
multiple geographies and that linked indicators to an action-oriented policy 
guide.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The framing of indexes and specifications such as domain 
weighting have substantial consequences for prioritizing disadvantaged 
populations. The HPI provides a model for tools and new methods that help 
prioritize investments and identify multisectoral opportunities for policy 
action.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and treatment uptake in prisons 
remains low. We aimed to estimate clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness (CE), 
and budgetary impact (BI) of HCV testing and treatment in United States (US) 
prisons or linkage to care at release.
METHODS: We used individual-based simulation modeling with healthcare and 
Department of Corrections (DOC) perspectives for CE and BI analyses, 
respectively. We simulated a US prison cohort at entry using published data and 
Washington State DOC individual-level data. We considered permutations of 
testing (risk factor based, routine at entry or at release, no testing), 
treatment (if liver fibrosis stage ≥F3, for all HCV infected or no treatment), 
and linkage to care (at release or no linkage). Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY); cases identified, treated, and cured; 
cirrhosis cases avoided; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; DOC costs (2016 
US dollars); and BI (healthcare cost/prison entrant) to generalize to other 
states.
RESULTS: Compared to "no testing, no treatment, and no linkage to care," the 
"test all, treat all, and linkage to care at release" model increased the 
lifetime sustained virologic response by 23%, reduced cirrhosis cases by 54% at 
a DOC annual additional cost of $1440 per prison entrant, and would be 
cost-effective. At current drug prices, targeted testing and liver 
fibrosis-based treatment provided worse outcomes at higher cost or worse 
outcomes at higher cost per QALY gained. In sensitivity analysis, fibrosis-based 
treatment restrictions were cost-effective at previous higher drug costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although costly, widespread testing and treatment in prisons is 
considered to be of good value at current drug prices.

BACKGROUND: Many people who inject drugs in the United States have chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV). On-site treatment in opiate agonist treatment (OAT) 
programs addresses HCV treatment barriers, but few evidence-based models exist.
METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment models for OAT 
patients using data from a randomized trial conducted in Bronx, New York. We 
used a decision analytic model to compare self-administered individual treatment 
(SIT), group treatment (GT), directly observed therapy (DOT), and no 
intervention for a simulated cohort with the same demographic characteristics of 
trial participants. We projected long-term outcomes using an established model 
of HCV disease progression and treatment (hepatitis C cost-effectiveness model: 
HEP-CE). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are reported in 2016 
US$/quality-adjusted life years (QALY), discounted 3% annually, from the 
healthcare sector and societal perspectives.
RESULTS: For those assigned to SIT, we projected 89% would ever achieve a 
sustained viral response (SVR), with 7.21 QALYs and a $245 500 lifetime cost, 
compared to 22% achieving SVR, with 5.49 QALYs and a $161 300 lifetime cost, 
with no intervention. GT was more efficient than SIT, resulting in 0.33 
additional QALYs and a $14 100 lower lifetime cost per person, with an ICER of 
$34 300/QALY, compared to no intervention. DOT was slightly more effective and 
costly than GT, with an ICER > $100 000/QALY, compared to GT. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, GT and DOT were preferred in 91% of simulations at a 
threshold of <$100 000/QALY; conclusions were similar from the societal 
perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: All models were associated with high rates of achieving SVR, 
compared to standard care. GT and DOT treatment models should be considered as 
cost-effective alternatives to SIT.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy, comorbidities become overt in 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although micturition problems are common, 
bladder function is poorly understood in DMD. We studied dystrophin expression 
and multiple isoform involvement in the bladder during maturation to gain 
insights into their roles in micturition.
METHODS: Dystrophin distribution was evaluated in rat bladders by 
immunohistochemical colocalization with smooth muscle, interstitial, urothelial, 
and neuronal markers. Protein levels of Dp140, Dp71, and smooth muscle were 
quantitated by Western blotting of neonatal to adult rat bladders.
RESULTS: Dystrophin colocalized with smooth muscle cells and afferent nerve 
fibers. Dp71 was expressed two- to threefold higher compared with Dp140, 
independently of age. Age-related muscle mass changes did not influence isoform 
expression levels.
DISCUSSION: Dystrophin is expressed in smooth muscle cells and afferent nerve 
fibers in the urinary bladder, which underscores that micturition problems in 
DMD may have not solely a myogenic but also a neurogenic origin. Muscle Nerve 
60: 202-210, 2019.

BACKGROUND: The EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) is a standard instrument that is 
widely used for measuring health-related quality of life and quality-adjusted 
life years in economic evaluation of healthcare interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate a preference valuation set for EQ-5D 3-level (3L) health 
states from the perspective of the general population in the capital of Iran.
METHODS: Eight hundred seventy adults aged ≥18 years were interviewed in Tehran 
(Iran's capital) from July to November 2013. The participants were selected by a 
stratified random sampling method and were interviewed face-to-face at their 
usual residence. Forty-two health states were selected and valued from the 243 
states derived from the EQ-5D-3L instrument. Each respondent valued 11 health 
states using the time trade-off method. Generalized least squares regression 
with random effect was used to predict values for health states.
RESULTS: The analysis was performed for 846 respondents. The final model yielded 
the best fit for the time trade-off value at the individual level with an 
overall R2 of 0.45 and a mean absolute error of 0.214. The mean values for the 
42 health states ranged from 0.934 for state 11121 to -0.142 for state 33333.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided for the first time a value set for calculating 
quality-adjusted life years from the EQ-5D instrument in Iran. The Iranian 
EQ-5D-3L value set slightly differs from the value sets of the UK and the United 
States.

OBJECTIVES: Transferability of economic evaluations to low- and middle-income 
countries through adaptation of models is important; however, several 
methodological and practical challenges remain. Given its significant costs and 
the quality-of-life burden to patients, adjuvant treatment of early breast 
cancer was identified as a priority intervention by the South African National 
Department of Health. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel 
and paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens (taxanes) compared with standard 
(non-taxane) treatments.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was undertaken based on a UK 6-health-state 
Markov model adapted for South Africa using the Mullins checklist. The analysis 
assumed a 35-year time horizon. The model was populated with clinical 
effectiveness data (hazard ratios, recurrence rates, and adverse events) using 
direct comparisons from clinical trials. Resource use patterns and unit costs 
for estimating cost parameters (drugs, diagnostics, consumables, personnel) were 
obtained from South Africa. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per patient for the docetaxel regimen compared 
with standard treatment was R6774. The incremental quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were 0.24, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R28430 
per QALY. The cost of the paclitaxel regimen compared with standard treatment 
was estimated as -R578 and -R1512, producing an additional 0.03 and 0.025 QALYs, 
based on 2 trials. Paclitaxel, therefore, appears to be a dominant intervention. 
The base case results were robust to all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the adapted model, docetaxel and paclitaxel are predicted 
to be cost-effective as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer in South 
Africa.

Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is the most common format for phage 
display antibody library. The isolated scFvs need to be reformatted to 
full-length IgGs for further characterization. High throughput reformatting of 
scFv to IgG without disrupting VH-VL pairing is of great demanding for 
exhaustive screening of all antibodies in IgG format. Herein, we developed a 
strategy based on the overlap extension PCR in emulsion to reformat scFv to IgG 
while maintain the accuracy and complexity of variable region pairing. Using 
CD40 as an example target, we reformatted phage display derived CD40 binding 
scFv library to IgG mammalian display library and isolated high affinity CD40 
binding IgGs. This robust and reliable antibody reformatting approach could be 
integrated into any phage display based antibody drug discovery.

Nowadays, sustainability has become of increasing concern in policy and the 
decision making of stakeholders. Companies have been increasing their attention 
to their environmental performance. In order to measure sustainability 
performance, different approaches have been proposed. The joint application of 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), called LCA+DEA, 
is used to assess eco-efficiency, which is to produce more with less 
environmental impact and with fewer resources. In this manuscript, we compare 
two methods that implement the LCA+DEA approach, the five-step and four-step 
methods, focused on Carbon Footprint (CF), called CF+DEA. These methods have not 
been compared previously. This comparison will encompass the theoretical and 
practical points of view according to efficiency indices, best practices, and 
targets for the CF emissions. To perform this comparison, we use a case study of 
raspberry producers in Chile. From a practical point of view, we have observed 
that both methods have achieved the main objective of reducing CF. Moreover, 
results show similar eco-efficiency scores; the targets given by the five-step 
method are less demanding than those given by the four-step method. In this 
sense, the four-step method provides a higher average CF reduction. This is due 
to the inclusion of CF as an undesirable output in the DEA assessment and the 
use of an output-oriented DEA model. Additionally, in including the CF within 
the DEA assessment, the four-step method reflects better the definition of 
eco-efficiency. Following these results, it is advisable to implement the 
targets provided by the five-step method for a short term and then the targets 
provided by the four-step method for a mid-term or long term.

Brain plasticity is important for translational purposes since most neurological 
disorders and brain aging problems remain substantially incurable. In the 
mammalian nervous system, neurons are mostly not renewed throughout life and 
cannot be replaced. In humans, the increasing life expectancy explains the 
increase in brain health problems, also producing heavy social and economic 
burden. An exception to the "static" brain is represented by stem cell niches 
leading to the production of new neurons. Such adult neurogenesis is 
dramatically reduced from fish to mammals, and in large-brained mammals with 
respect to rodents. Some examples of neurogenesis occurring outside the 
neurogenic niches have been reported, yet these new neurons actually do not 
integrate in the mature nervous tissue. Non-newly generated, "immature" neurons 
(nng-INs) are also present: Prenatally generated cells continuing to express 
molecules of immaturity (mostly shared with the newly born neurons). Of 
interest, nng-INs seem to show an inverse phylogenetic trend across mammals, 
being abundant in higher-order brain regions not served by neurogenesis and 
providing structural plasticity in rather stable areas. Both newly generated and 
nng-INs represent a potential reservoir of young cells (a "brain reserve") that 
might be exploited for preventing the damage of aging and/or delay the 
onset/reduce the impact of neurological disorders.

Pine needles are widely used as bio-indicators due to their worldwide 
distribution and the ease of sample collection. In contrast to deciduous trees, 
conifers offer the possibility of monitoring long-term exposure through older 
needles. Pinus halepensis Miller is a pine species native to the Mediterranean 
region, which has been used for restoration activities in arid and semiarid 
areas leading to vast spatial expansion. Needles from pine trees collected in 
the southeastern to northwestern extension of Croatia's coastal area at twelve 
sampling sites were analysed for twenty-one metals and metalloids. Statistical 
evaluation of the obtained data revealed significant differences for Al, As, B, 
Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, and Sr between the different regions. Needles 
from trees growing on islands did not show elevated levels of Mg and/or Na as a 
result of the sea spray influence. The differences in metal accumulation are 
supposed to be linked to the environmental conditions at the respective sampling 
site, since the species was the same everywhere. By comparing the elemental 
contents of the soil those of with needles, it can be clearly seen, that the 
root as well as the foliar uptake contribute to the final amount.

BACKGROUND: Reduced muscle strength and physical performance are prevalent in 
patients of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), and deleterious changes in these 
parameters are associated with increased mortality.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 306 patients, who 
received a 6-month resistance exercise program during hemodialysis, three times 
per week on an outpatient basis. The training protocol consisted of two sets of 
10 repetitions of knee extension, hip abduction, and hip flexion, using an 
elastic band in a sitting or supine position. Primary outcome measures included 
muscle strength, measured by percent knee extension muscle power to dry body 
weight (pKEMP-dBW), and physical performance, measured by short physical 
performance battery (SPPB). The adjusted mean differences in these variables 
during the 6 months were estimated using a multivariate linear regression model.
RESULTS: The mean age with standard deviation was 70 ± 11 years. One hundred and 
sixty patients (52.3%) were men and the dry weight was 55.6 ± 11.3 kg. 
Sarcopenia, defined as SPPB ≤8, was present in 21.4% patients. Their 
hemodialysis adequacy was acceptable, with a Kt/V of 1.65 ± 0.29, and their 
nutritional status was good, with a normalized protein catabolism rate of 
0.89 ± 0.18 g/kg/day. During the 6 months, both pKEMP-dBW and SPPB showed a 
slight but significant increase with an adjusted mean difference of 2.8 (95% 
confidence interval 1.3-4.3, p <  0.001) and 0.6 (0.4-0.9, p <  0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Six-month resistance training was associated with improved muscle 
strength and physical performance in patients with MHD.
