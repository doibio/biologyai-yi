BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underused by minority 
populations, and patient navigation increases adherence with screening 
colonoscopy. In this study, the authors estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
navigation for screening colonoscopy from the perspective of a payer seeking to 
improve population health.
METHODS: A validated model of CRC screening was informed with inputs from 
navigation studies in New York City (population: 43% African American, 49% 
Hispanic, 4% white, 4% other; base-case screening: 40% without navigation, 65% 
with navigation; navigation costs: $29 per colonoscopy completer, $21 per 
noncompleter, $3 per non-navigated individual). Two analyses compared: 1) 
navigation versus no navigation for 1-time screening colonoscopy in unscreened 
individuals aged ≥ 50 years; and 2) programs of colonoscopy with versus without 
navigation versus fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical 
testing (FIT) for individuals ages 50 to 80 years.
RESULTS: In the base case: 1) 1-time navigation gained quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and decreased costs; 2) longitudinal navigation cost $9800 
per QALY gained versus no navigation, and, assuming comparable uptake rates, it 
cost $118,700 per QALY gained versus FOBT but was less effective and more costly 
than FIT. The results were most dependent on screening participation rates and 
navigation costs: 1) assuming a 5% increase in screening uptake with navigation, 
and a navigation cost of $150 per completer, 1-time navigation cost $26,400 per 
QALY gained; and 2) longitudinal navigation with 75% colonoscopy uptake cost 
<$25,000 per QALY gained versus FIT when FIT uptake was <50%. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses did not alter the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Navigation for screening colonoscopy appears to be cost-effective, 
and 1-time navigation may be cost-saving. In emerging health care models that 
reward outcomes, payers should consider covering the costs of navigation for 
screening colonoscopy.

[Fracture of the medial femoral neck: is there still a place for conservative 
treatment?].

Non-displaced fractures of the femoral neck are generally internally fixated 
while preserving the femoral head. The current guideline states that 
conservative treatment of non-displaced (impacted) femoral neck fractures may be 
considered in patients with a 'healthy' patient profile and in patients who have 
already borne weight on the broken hip. This literature review shows that 
conservative treatment of patients with impacted hip fractures fails in 
approximately 30% of the cases. In most cases, patients in whom conservative 
treatment has failed will receive a femoral neck prosthesis or total hip 
replacement. The placement of femoral neck prosthesis has a higher surgical and 
anaesthesiological risk compared to internal fixation of the non-displaced 
femoral neck fracture. Given the quality of surgical techniques and improvement 
in perioperative care, the operative risk is limited and direct internal 
fixation should be strongly considered for non-displaced femoral neck fractures 
in all patients whose life expectancy is longer than 2 weeks.

cell lung cancer.

Postoperative recurrence occurs in approximately half of patients with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), even after complete resection. Disease recurrence 
after surgical resection reduces the patient's life expectancy sharply. The 
prognosis after postoperative recurrence is considered to largely depend on both 
the mode of first recurrence (distant, locoregional or combined) and the 
treatment modality: (1) The majority of cases of postoperative recurrence 
involve distant metastasis with or without locoregional recurrence. 
Platinum-based systemic chemotherapy is practically accepted as the treatment 
for these diseases on the basis of evidence for original stage IV disease. The 
advent of both pemetrexed and molecular-targeted drugs has improved the survival 
of nonsquamous NSCLC and changed the chemotherapeutic algorithm for NSCLC; (2) 
Among patients with distant metastatic recurrence without locoregional 
recurrence at the primary tumor site, the metastasis is often limited in both 
organ and number. Such metastases are referred to as oligometastases. Local 
therapy, such as surgical resection and radiotherapy, has been suggested to be 
the first-line treatment of choice for oligometastatic recurrence; and (3) While 
locoregional recurrence is likely to cause troublesome symptoms, it is a 
potentially limited disease. Therefore, providing local control is important, 
and radiation is usually beneficial for treating local recurrence. In order to 
obtain better control of the disease and provide treatment with curative intent 
in patients with limited disease, the administration of concurrent 
platinum-based chemoradiotherapy is recommended according to the results of 
originally nonresectable stage IIIA and IIIB disease.

Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells involves a 
dynamic rearrangement of the epigenetic landscape. To characterize this 
epigenomic roadmap, we have performed MethylC-seq, ChIP-seq (H3K4/K27/K36me3) 
and RNA-Seq on samples taken at several time points during murine secondary 
reprogramming as part of Project Grandiose. We find that DNA methylation gain 
during reprogramming occurs gradually, while loss is achieved only at the 
ESC-like state. Binding sites of activated factors exhibit focal demethylation 
during reprogramming, while ESC-like pluripotent cells are distinguished by 
extension of demethylation to the wider neighbourhood. We observed that genes 
with CpG-rich promoters demonstrate stable low methylation and strong engagement 
of histone marks, whereas genes with CpG-poor promoters are safeguarded by 
methylation. Such DNA methylation-driven control is the key to the regulation of 
ESC-pluripotency genes, including Dppa4, Dppa5a and Esrrb. These results reveal 
the crucial role that DNA methylation plays as an epigenetic switch driving 
somatic cells to pluripotency.

Palliative care case managers in primary care: a descriptive study of referrals 
in relation to treatment aims.

BACKGROUND: Three important elements of the World Health Organization (WHO) 
definition of palliative care are: 1) it includes patients who may have cure or 
life prolongation as treatment aims besides palliative care; 2) it is not 
exclusively for cancer patients; and 3) it includes attention to the medical, 
psychological, social, and spiritual needs of the patients and their families. 
Case managers (nurses with expertise in palliative care) may assist generalist 
primary care providers in delivery of good palliative care.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the referral of patients to case managers in 
primary care with regard to the three elements mentioned: diagnosis, treatment 
aims, and needs as reflected in reasons given for referral.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey in primary care among case managers and 
referrers to case management, case managers completed questionnaires for 687 
patients; referrers completed 448 (65%).
RESULTS: Most patients referred have a combination of treatment aims (69%). Life 
expectancy and functional status of patients are lower for those with a 
treatment aim of palliation. Almost all (96%) of those referred are cancer 
patients. A need for psychosocial support is frequently given as a reason for 
referral (66%) regardless of treatment aim.
CONCLUSIONS: Referrals to case managers reflect two of three elements of the WHO 
definition. Mainly, patients are referred for support complementary to medical 
care, and relatively early in their disease trajectory. However, most of those 
referred are cancer patients. Thus, to fully reflect the definition, broadening 
the scope to reach other patient groups is important.

Lowering blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes has clear benefits 
for preventing microvascular complications and potential benefits for reducing 
macrovascular complications and death. Treatment needs to be individualised for 
each person with diabetes. This should start with selecting appropriate glucose 
and glycated haemoglobin targets, taking into account life expectancy and the 
patient's wishes. For most people, early use of glucose-lowering therapies is 
warranted. A range of recently available therapies has added to the options for 
lowering glucose levels, but this has made the clinical pathway for treating 
diabetes more complicated. This position statement from the Australian Diabetes 
Society outlines the risks, benefits and costs of the available therapies and 
suggests a treatment algorithm incorporating the older and newer agents.

Gender differences in outcomes of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Harness-Brumley CL(1), Elliott AC, Rosenbluth DB, Raghavan D, Jain R.

Dallas, Texas.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic disease in 
which women have been described to have worse outcomes than males, particularly 
in response to respiratory infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, as 
advancements in therapies have improved life expectancy, this gender disparity 
has been challenged. The objective of this study is to examine whether a 
gender-based survival difference still exists in this population and determine 
the impact of common CF respiratory infections on outcomes in males versus 
females with CF.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 32,766 patients from 
the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry over a 13-year 
period. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 
overall mortality and pathogen based survival rates in males and females.
RESULTS: Females demonstrated a decreased median life expectancy (36.0 years; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 35.0-37.3) compared with men (38.7 years; 95% CI 
37.8-39.6; p<0.001). Female gender proved to be a significant risk factor for 
death (hazard ratio 2.22, 95% CI 1.79-2.77), despite accounting for variables 
known to influence CF mortality. Women were also found to become colonized 
earlier with several bacteria and to have worse outcomes with common CF 
pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: CF women continue to have a shortened life expectancy relative to 
men despite accounting for key CF-related comorbidities. Women also become 
colonized with certain common CF pathogens earlier than men and show a decreased 
life expectancy in the setting of respiratory infections. Explanations for this 
gender disparity are only beginning to be unraveled and further investigation 
into mechanisms is needed to help develop therapies that may narrow this gender 
gap.

Uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw) improves quality of life in patients with 
advanced solid tumors.

OBJECTIVE: Cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) is a native Amazon plant that exhibits 
anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. We wanted to assess its activity for 
symptom management of terminal cancer patients.
METHODS: This prospective phase II study assessed the effects of a 100-mg dose 
of a dry extract of U. tomentosa three times per day in patients with advanced 
solid tumors who had no further therapeutic options and a life expectancy of at 
least 2 months. The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue questionnaires were used to assess the 
participants' quality of life, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
questionnaire was used to assess anxiety and depression, and the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality. In addition, several 
biochemical and inflammatory parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-one volunteers were recruited. Their median age was 64 (range, 
33-85) years, and 47% of patients were female. More than 65% of patients had 
scores on the Karnofsky Performance Scale of 80% or less. Treatment improved the 
patients' overall quality of life (p=0.0411) and social functioning (p=0.0341), 
as assessed by the EORTC QLQ C-30, and reduced fatigue (p=0.0496) according to 
the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire. None of the biochemical or inflammatory 
parameters assessed (interleukin-1 and -6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis 
factor-α, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and α-1-acid glycoprotein) changed 
significantly. No tumor response was detected according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors; however, the disease stabilized for more 
than 8 months in four participants. The medication was well tolerated by most 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Use of cat's claw might be beneficial in patients with advanced 
cancer by improving their quality of life and reducing fatigue. The mechanism of 
action does not seem to be related to the anti-inflammatory properties of this 
plant.

An exploration of China's mortality decline under Mao: A provincial analysis, 
1950-80.

Between 1950 and 1980, China experienced the most rapid sustained increase in 
life expectancy of any population in documented global history. We know of no 
study that has quantitatively assessed the relative importance of the various 
explanations proposed for this gain in survival. We have created and analysed a 
new, province-level panel data set spanning the decades between 1950 and 1980 by 
combining historical information from China's public health archives, official 
provincial yearbooks, and infant and child mortality records contained in the 
1988 National Survey of Fertility and Contraception. Although exploratory, our 
results suggest that gains in school enrolment and public health campaigns 
together are associated with 55-70 per cent of China's dramatic reductions in 
infant and under-5 mortality during our study period. These results underscore 
the importance of non-medical determinants of population health, and suggest 
that, in some circumstances, general education of the population may amplify the 
effectiveness of public health interventions.

Ethiopia: implications for adoption of essential interventions for saving 
newborn lives.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is among seven high-mortality countries which have achieved 
the fourth millennium development goal with over two-thirds reduction in 
under-five mortality rate. However, the proportion of neonatal deaths continues 
to rise and recent studies reported low coverage of the essential interventions 
saving newborn lives. In the context of low uptake of health facility delivery, 
it is relevant to explore routine practices during home deliveries and, in this 
study, we explored the sequence of immediate newborn care practices and 
associated beliefs following home deliveries in rural communities in Ethiopia.
METHODS: Between April-May 2013, we conducted 26 semi-structured interviews and 
2 focus group discussions with eligible mothers, as well as a key informant 
interview with a local expert in traditional newborn care practices in rural 
Basona woreda (district) near the urban town of Debrebirhan, 120 km from Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia.
RESULTS: The most frequently cited sequence of newborn care practices reported 
by mothers with home deliveries in the rural Basona woreda was to tie the cord, 
immediately bath then dry the newborn, practice 'Lanka mansat' (local 
traditional practice on newborns), give pre-lacteal feeding and then initiate 
breastfeeding. For 'Lanka mansat', the traditional birth attendant applies mild 
pressure inside the baby's mouth on the soft palate using her index finger. This 
is performed believing that the baby will have 'better voice' and 'speak 
clearly' later in life.
CONCLUSION: Coverage figures fail to tell the whole story as to why some 
essential interventions are not practiced and, in this study, we identified 
established norms or routines within the rural communities that determine the 
sequence of newborn care practices following home births. This might explain why 
some mothers delay initiation of breastfeeding and implementation of other 
recommended essential interventions saving newborn lives. An in-depth 
understanding of established routines is necessary, and community health 
extension workers require further training and negotiation skills in order to 
change the behaviour of mothers in practicing essential interventions while 
respecting local values and norms within the communities.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
5-fluorouracil 0.5%/salicylic acid 10% (5-FU/SA) in the treatment of isolated 
hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis lesions in Spain.
METHODS: An analytical decision-making model was constructed to compare whether 
5-FU/SA was a cost-effective option compared with cryotherapy from the 
perspective of the Spanish National Health System with a time horizon of 6 
months. Costs were expressed in 2014 euros.
RESULTS: The cost of patients with hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis treated with 
5-FU/SA or cryotherapy was €266 and €285, respectively. 5-FU/SA was associated 
with higher rates of treatment success and, consequently, more quality-adjusted 
life years, than cryotherapy. Therefore, 5-FU/SA was the dominant treatment, as 
it was associated with a lower treatment cost and greater effectiveness than 
cryotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Economically, 5-FU/SA was a dominant option compared with 
cryotherapy in the treatment of isolated hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis 
lesions in Spain.

Validation of the Chinese version of the dementia screening questionnaire for 
individuals with intellectual disabilities (DSQIID-CV).

Rehabilitation Complex, Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: An increasing number of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) 
are at risk of developing age-related disorders such as dementia because of a 
dramatic increase in life expectancy in this population in the recent years. 
There is no validated dementia screening instrument for Chinese people with ID. 
The Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual 
Disabilities (DSQIID) was reported to be a valid, user-friendly, easy-to-use 
observer-rated instrument. It was developed in the UK and has good psychometric 
properties. Validation of a Chinese version of the DSQIID will facilitate its 
application among the Chinese population.
METHOD: The DSQIID was translated into the Chinese version (DSQIID-CV). By 
purposive sampling, service users with ID aged 40 years or over were recruited 
through two large centres serving adults with ID in Hong Kong. Carers who had 
taken care of the participants continuously for the past 6 months were invited 
to complete the DSQIID-CV. All participants were examined by qualified 
psychiatrists to determine the presence or absence of dementia.
RESULTS: Two hundred people with ID whose age ranged between 40 and 73 years 
(mean 51 years, SD=7.34 years) were recruited to the study. A clinical diagnosis 
of dementia was established in 13 participants. An overall total score of 22 as 
a screening cut-off provided the optimum levels of specificity (0.995) and 
sensitivity (0.923). The DSQIID-CV showed good internal consistency 
(alpha=0.945) for all its 53 items, and excellent test-retest reliability 
(0.978, n=46) and inter-rater reliability (1.000, n=47). Exploratory factor 
analysis resulted in a four-factor solution explaining 45% of the total 
variance.
CONCLUSIONS: The DSQIID-CV is shown to have robust psychometric properties. It

BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
ivabradine plus standard care (SoC) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with 
sinus rhythm and a baseline heart rate ≥ 75 b.p.m. in Greece, in comparison with 
current SoC alone.
METHODS: An existing cost-effectiveness model consisting of two health states, 
was adapted to the Greek health care setting. All clinical inputs of the model 
(i.e. mortality rates, hospitalization rates, NYHA class distribution and 
utility values) were estimated from SHIFT trial data. All costing data used in 
the model reflects the year 2013 (in €). An incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. The 
horizon of analysis was over patient life time and both cost and outcomes were 
discounted at 3.5% per year. The analysis was conducted from a Greek third 
party-payer perspective.
RESULTS: The Markov analysis revealed that the discounted quality-adjusted 
survival was 4.27 and 3.99 QALYs in the ivabradine plus SoC and SoC alone 
treatment arms, respectively. The cumulative lifetime total cost per patient was 
€8,665 and €5,873, for ivabradine plus SoC and SoC alone, respectively. The ICER 
for ivabradine plus SoC versus SoC alone was estimated as €9,986 per QALY 
gained. The PSA showed that the likelihood of ivabradine plus SoC being 
cost-effective at a threshold of €36,000/QALY was found to be 95%.
CONCLUSIONS: Ivabradine plus SoC may be regarded as a cost-effective option for 
the treatment in CHF patients in Greece.

AIMS: Mortality-associated burden of disease estimates from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2010 (GBD 2010) may erroneously lead to the interpretation that 
premature death in people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders 
(MNSDs) is inconsequential when evidence shows that people with MNSDs experience 
a significant reduction in life expectancy. We explore differences between 
cause-specific and excess mortality of MNSDs estimated by GBD 2010.
METHODS: GBD 2010 cause-specific death estimates were produced using the 
International Classification of Diseases death-coding system. Excess mortality 
(all-cause) was estimated using natural history models. Additional mortality 
attributed to MNSDs as underlying causes but not captured through GBD 2010 
methodology is quantified in the comparative risk assessments.
RESULTS: In GBD 2010, MNSDs were estimated to be directly responsible for 840 
000 deaths compared with more than 13 million excess deaths using natural 
history models.
CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of excess deaths and attributable deaths clearly 
demonstrate the high degree of mortality associated with these disorders. There 
is substantial evidence pointing to potential causal pathways for this premature 
mortality with evidence-based interventions available to address this mortality. 
The life expectancy gap between persons with MNSDs and the general population is 
high and should be a focus for health systems reform.

The ventral phalloplasty (VP) has been well described in modern day penile 
prosthesis surgery. The main objectives of this maneuver are to increase 
perceived length and patient satisfaction and to counteract the natural 1-2 cm 
average loss in length when performing implantation of an inflatable penile 
prosthesis. Similarly, this video represents a new adaptation for partial 
penectomy patients. One can only hope that the addition of the VP for partial 
penectomy patients with good erectile function will increase their quality of 
life. The patient in this video is a 56-year-old male who presented with a 
4.0x3.5x1.0 cm, pathologic stage T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glans penis. 
After partial penectomy with VP and inguinal lymph node dissection, pathological 
specimen revealed negative margins, 3/5 right superficial nodes and 1/5 left 
superficial nodes positive for malignancy. The patient has been recommended 
post-operative systemic chemotherapy (with external beam radiotherapy) based on 
the multiple node positivity and presence of extranodal extension. The patient's 
pre-operative penile length was 9.5 cm, and after partial penectomy with VP, 
penile length is 7 cm.

CONTEXT: Medicare currently pays for 23 preventive services in its benefits 
package, the majority of which were added since 2005. In the past decade, the 
program has transformed from one essentially administering treatment claims, to 
one increasingly focused on health promotion and maintenance. What is largely 
unappreciated is the role cost-effectiveness analysis has played in the coverage 
of preventive services.
METHODS: We review the role of cost-effectiveness analysis in Medicare coverage 
of preventive services and contrast it to the lack of such consideration in the 
coverage of treatments.
FINDINGS: While not considered for coverage of treatment, cost-effectiveness 
analysis played a role in the coverage of nine preventive services, and was 
evaluated in a number of instances when the service was not added. Pneumococcal 
vaccine, the first preventive service added to the benefit (1981), followed a 
Congressionally requested cost-effectiveness analysis, which showed it to be 
cost-saving. More recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
reviewed cost-effectiveness evidence when covering preventive services such as 
HIV screening (2010) and screening and behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse 
(2011) (studies reported cost-effectiveness ratios of $55,440 per QALY, and 
$1755 per QALY, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis has played a longstanding role in 
informing the addition of preventive services to Medicare. It offers Medicare 
officials information they can use to help ensure health gains are achieved at 
reasonable cost. However, limiting cost-effectiveness evidence to prevention and 
not treatment is inconsistent and potentially inefficient.

BACKGROUND: In 2012, CDC launched the first federally funded national mass media 
antismoking campaign. The Tips From Former Smokers (Tips) campaign resulted in a 
12% relative increase in population-level quit attempts.
PURPOSE: Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in 2013 to evaluate Tips from 
a funding agency's perspective.
METHODS: Estimates of sustained cessations; premature deaths averted; 
undiscounted life years (LYs) saved; and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained by Tips were estimated.
RESULTS: Tips saved about 179,099 QALYs and prevented 17,109 premature deaths in 
the U.S. With the campaign cost of roughly $48 million, Tips spent approximately 
$480 per quitter, $2,819 per premature death averted, $393 per LY saved, and 
$268 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Tips was not only successful at reducing smoking-attributable 
morbidity and mortality but also was a highly cost-effective mass media 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Many algorithms exist for converting the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ) score to utility in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Different 
algorithms convert the same HAQ score to different utility values, and could 
therefore lead to different cost-effectiveness results.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of different mapping algorithms within the 
same cost-effectiveness model.
METHODS: We rebuilt an existing economic model that had previously been used for 
estimating the cost-effectiveness of second-line biologics in RA. We reviewed 
the literature to identify algorithms that converted the HAQ score to utility 
and incorporated them into the model. We compared the cost-effectiveness results 
using different algorithms, exploring the reasons behind the different results 
and the potential effect on reimbursement decisions.
RESULTS: We identified 24 different algorithms that estimated utility on the 
basis of the HAQ score, age, sex, and pain. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for rituximab versus disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs varied between 
£18,407/quality-adjusted life-year and £32,039/quality-adjusted life-year, which 
we speculate could have changed the recommendations made by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
CONCLUSIONS: Using different algorithms to convert the HAQ score to utility 
affects the cost-effectiveness of second-line biologics for the treatment of RA. 
Using different algorithms in economic modeling for RA could lead health 
technology assessment bodies to make different reimbursement decisions.

BACKGROUND: There has been some controversy on whether the costs of omalizumab 
outweigh its benefits for severe persistent allergic asthma.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to resolve the uncertainties and limitations of 
previous analyses and establish the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab under the 
list price and Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discounted price for the UK National 
Health Service.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of omalizumab under the perspective of the National Health 
Service. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patient 
subgroups were defined post hoc on the basis of data collected in clinical 
trials: previous hospitalization, on maintenance oral corticosteroids, and three 
or more previous exacerbations.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied from £30,109 to £57,557 
per QALY gained depending on the population considered using the PAS price; 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were over a third higher using the list 
price. Omalizumab is likely to be cost-effective at the threshold of £30,000 per 
QALY gained in the severe subgroups if the improvement in health-related quality 
of life from omalizumab is mapped from an asthma-specific measure to the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (vs. the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire 
directly collected from patients) or asthma mortality refers to death after 
hospitalization from asthma (vs. asthma-mortality risk in the community).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab is more favorable 
under the PAS price, it represents good value for money only in severe subgroups 
and under optimistic assumptions regarding asthma mortality and improvement in 
health-related quality of life. For these reasons, omalizumab should be 
carefully targeted to ensure value for money.

BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitors such as telaprevir (Incivo) are reimbursed in 
Australia for the treatment of patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of telaprevir plus PR compared with 
PR alone in 1) previously untreated patients and 2) patients who had received 
treatment with PR earlier.
METHODS: Sustained virological response rates and average treatment durations of 
telaprevir and PR (given with or without telaprevir) were taken from the 
telaprevir ADVANCE and REALIZE clinical trials but were modified to take account 
of differences in prescribing rules between the trials and Australian clinical 
practice. The probability of transitioning between Markov disease states was 
based on data from the Australian Kirby Institute where possible and 
supplemented using data from the published literature. Utility values obtained 
from the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire data collected in the ADVANCE 
and REALIZE trials were used to represent the utility during HCV treatment. 
Utility values for Markov health states were taken from the published 
literature. Unit costs (2014 AU $) were taken from Australian sources.
RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, the discounted cost per life-years gained 
was AU $37,706 and the discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year was AU 
$19,283. In treatment-experienced patients, the discounted cost per life-year 
gained was AU $23,855 and the discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year was 
AU $14,948.
CONCLUSION: Telaprevir plus PR in the Australian setting is cost-effective when 
compared with PR alone in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV.

OBJECTIVES: Health valuation studies enhance economic evaluations of treatments 
by estimating the value of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The 
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) includes a 
29-item short-form HRQOL measure, the PROMIS-29.
METHODS: To value PROMIS-29 responses on a quality-adjusted life-year scale, we 
conducted a national survey (N = 7557) using quota sampling based on the US 2010 
Census. Based on 541 paired comparisons with over 350 responses each, 
pair-specific probabilities were incorporated into a weighted least-squared 
estimator.
RESULTS: All losses in HRQOL influenced choice; however, respondents valued 
losses in physical function, anxiety, depression, sleep, and pain more than 
those in fatigue and social functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces a novel approach to valuing HRQOL for 
economic evaluations using paired comparisons and provides a tool to translate 
PROMIS-29 responses into quality-adjusted life-years.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of low phase angle (PhA) values on muscle 
strength, quality of life, symptom severity, and 1-year mortality in older 
cancer patients.
DESIGN: Prospective study with 1-year follow-up.
PARTICIPANTS: Cancer patients aged >60 years.
METHODS: PhA was derived from whole body impedance analysis. The fifth 
percentile of age-, sex-, and body mass index-stratified reference values were 
used as cut-off. Quality of life was determined with the European Organization 
of Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire, reflecting both several 
function scales and symptom severity. Muscle strength was assessed by hand grip 
strength, knee extension strength, and peak expiratory flow.
RESULTS: 433 cancer patients, aged 60-95 years, were recruited. Patients with 
low PhA (n = 197) exhibited decreased muscle strength compared with patients 
with normal PhA (hand grip strength: 22 ± 8.6 vs 28.9 ± 8.9 kg, knee extension 
strength: 20.8 ± 11.8 vs 28.1 ± 14.9 kg, and peak expiratory flow: 301.1 ± 118 
vs 401.7 ± 142.6 L/min, P < .001). Physical function, global health status, and 
role function from the European Organization of Research and Treatment in Cancer 
questionnaire were reduced, and most symptoms (fatigue, anorexia, pain, and 
dyspnea) increased in patients with low PhA (P < .001). In a risk-factor 
adjusted regression analysis, PhA emerged as independent predictor of physical 
function (ß:-0.538, P = .023), hand grip strength (ß:-4.684, P < .0001), knee 
extension strength (ß:-4.548, P = .035), and peak expiratory flow (ß:-66.836, P 
< .0001). Low PhA moreover predicted 1-year mortality in the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model, whereas grip strength was no longer significant.
CONCLUSIONS: PhA below the fifth reference percentile is highly predictive of 
decreased muscle strength, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality in 
old patients with cancer and should be evaluated in routine assessment.
