estimated significant (p<0.05) increments in the percent of GDP expended on 
health care (+0.14%), percent of general government expenditures targeted to 
health care (+0.25%), total per capita expenditures on health (+34.4Int$) and 
per capita general government expenditures (+22.4Int$), while controlling for a 
population's age distribution, life expectancy, health care workforce and system 
effectiveness and gross national income. Moreover, these relationships were 
found to persist across socio-economic development levels. The finding that 
practices of health care expenditure and authority structures of government 
co-vary is instructive about the politics of health and the challenges of 
advancing global health objectives.

Malignant central airway obstruction is a life-threatening presentation 
requiring emergency palliative procedure. In selected patients, bronchoscopic 
intervention could be used as a bridge to curative resection. Here we report a 
54-year-old male with pulmonary sarcoma of the right upper lobe, presenting with 
acute respiratory failure because of endobronchial extension. Emergency coring 
with the rigid bronchoscope and Dumon stent insertion stabilized the patient, 
and subsequent lobectomy resulted in occurrence-free survival over a 71-month 
follow-up.

Duration of anticoagulation for the management of venous thromboembolism in 
inflammatory bowel disease: a decision analysis.

Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. geoff.nguyen@utoronto.ca

OBJECTIVES: There is practice variation in the duration of anticoagulation for 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. 
Clinicians must weigh the high risk of recurrent VTE with the risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding.
METHODS: We implemented Markov decision analysis to compare the costs and 
effectiveness of extended anticoagulation vs. time-limited anticoagulation (6 
months) among IBD patients with first unprovoked VTE over a 5-year time horizon. 
In a secondary analysis, we added two strategies in which therapeutic-dose or 
prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was administered during IBD flares.
RESULTS: Compared with time-limited anticoagulation, extended anticoagulation 
yielded slightly higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (4.40 vs. 4.38) and 
costs ($21,158 vs. $20,825), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of $15,254/QALY over 5 years. In secondary analysis, pharmacological prophylaxis 
during IBD flares was associated with the highest QALYs (4.41) and costs 
($28,177), but was not cost-effective when compared with extended 
anticoagulation (ICER=$1,158,717/QALY). Anticoagulation during flares yielded 
the lowest cost ($19,681) and same QALYs as extended anticoagulation. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, extended anticoagulation yielded higher 
QALYs than time-limited anticoagulation in 91% of trials and was dominant or 
cost-effective (<$50,000/QALY) in 72% of trials. When analyzed over a lifetime, 
extended anticoagulation dominated time-limited anticoagulation with higher 
effectiveness (18.44 vs. 17.95 QALYs) and lower costs ($94,738 vs. $102,874) and 
was highly robust in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that extended anticoagulation may provide 
marginal benefit over time-limited anticoagulation and should be considered in 
the management of first unprovoked VTE in IBD. Anticoagulation and prophylaxis 
during IBD flares are alternative viable strategies.

Osteoarthritis of the hip is a common pathology and involves forms of disability 
and need for treatments that affect the quality of life of patients and their 
families, and in general of the whole society. It should be considered as such 
degenerative joint disease is increasing as the increase in life expectancy and 
musculoskeletal trauma, the latter responsible for secondary forms of 
osteoarthritis. The treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip has changed a lot 
over the years, since the earlier diagnosis and, before, with prevention through 
proper lifestyle. More in-depth knowledge of the biology of the tissues 
involved, first of all hyaline cartilage, has lead to non-surgical treatments 
such as infiltration with hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) and autologous 
growth factors derived from platelets (platelet rich plasma). Surgical therapy 
with prosthetic replacement is finally a choice to share with the patient based 
on pain and functional limitation, bearing in mind always the best technology 
and tribology and the possibility of less invasive surgical access, while 
recognizing that there are not still eternal prosthesis. Of particular 
importance then is the age of the patient. There are also other types of surgery 
(hip arthroscopy, forage) for other pathologies of the hip which can be 
resolutive, or, in a sense, can delay the arrival to the prosthetic replacement. 
We will discuss below the decision-making process that leads the surgeon with 
the patient to the surgery option.

We aimed to provide systemic, empirical evidence on the coverage expansion of 
primary health care (PHC) linking to good health in low- and middle-income 
countries. We conducted a pooled, cross-sectional analysis using the 2011 World 
Health Statistics for World Health Organization Member States at low- and 
middle-income levels (n = 102). With life expectancy, infant mortality, and 
under-5 mortality as health indicators, we examined the effect of service 
coverage rate using variables under 2 domains: health expenditure and PHC 
(public health provision, primary care access). Our results indicated that after 
controlling for gross national income per capita, higher total health 
expenditure as share of gross domestic product was associated with shorter life 
expectancy (β = -0.99; P = .014), higher infant mortality (β = 1.65; P = .155), 
and under-5 mortality (β = 4.82; P = .020). Multivariate analysis showed higher 
coverage of public health services was significantly associated with improved 
population health. Making public health and primary care services accessible and 
be used by everyone is the wise means toward improved health.

Self-assembling peptides improve the stability of glucagon-like peptide-1 by 
forming a stable and sustained complex.

China.

The multiple physiological characterizations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
make it a promising drug candidate for the treatment of T2DM. However, the short 
half-life of GLP-1 limits its clinical utility. Self-assembling peptides are 
presumed to wrap GLP-1 peptide, and this helps to prolong the stability of GLP-1 
consequently. The aim of this study was to investigate whether self-assembling 
peptides could be applied to prolong the half-life of GLP-1 as sustained release 
preparations. In this study, five different self-assembling peptides were 
employed. The formation of the complexes was monitored using gel filtration and 
mass spectrometry and was simulated by Molecular Dynamics. Stabilization, 
insulin secretion stimulation, and glucose tolerance tests were performed to 
investigate the physiological characteristics retained by GLP-1 following 
complex formation with self-assembling peptides. Our findings revealed that, 
among the five different self-assembling peptides tested, complex of Pep-1 and 
GLP-1 exhibited a remarkable extension in the half-life of GLP-1. In addition, 
the experimental animals treated with a GLP-1/Pep-1 complex exhibited better 
blood glucose clearance activity over a greater duration of time than the 
animals treated with GLP-1 alone. Based on our results, an adjustment of the 
Pep-1 and GLP-1 ratios is presumed to be able to control the half-life of GLP-1 
(e.g., medium-acting and long-acting). Collectively, the findings in this study 
suggest that the self-assembling peptide Pep-1 could serve as a powerful drug 
preparation tool to extend the short half-life of therapeutic peptides.

BACKGROUND: The etiology of functional dyspepsia (FD) is multi-factorial. Its 
prevalence is high and it considerably impairs the patients' quality of life. 
The treatment options are limited. Padma Digestin, a multi-herbal formula from 
Tibetan Medicine, is traditionally used in malabsorption and dyspeptic symptoms 
as they do occur in FD, but as yet no clinical data exist on the formula. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
Padma Digestin in patients with FD in a prospective, open, clinical phase III 
trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited by general practitioners, 
internists, and gastroenterologists and treated with 2 × 3 capsules of Padma 
Digestin daily for 6 weeks. Dyspeptic symptoms were analyzed using the 
Domestic/International Gastroenterology Surveillance Study (DIGEST) 
questionnaire extended by the 2 symptoms stomach cramps and lack of appetite. 
The quality of life was assessed using the Psychological General Well-Being 
Index (PGWBI-S) questionnaire (short version).
RESULTS: 37 patients were admitted and efficacy could be assessed in 31. In the 
overall efficacy assessment, the Padma Digestin treatment led to a statistically 
highly significant reduction of the respective most bothersome symptom scores 
regarding frequency, severity, and impairment of daily activities (p < 0.01). 
The treatment also led to significant improvements of the individual symptoms of 
postprandial fullness, nausea, localized and diffuse epigastric pain, stomach 
cramps, and lack of appetite. The onset of improvement was after a median of 7 
days; time until disappearance of the symptoms was after a median of 22 days. 
The global efficacy and tolerability were rated as good or very good by the 
doctors and the patients in 84% and 78%, respectively. The PGWBI-S increased 
from 55 ± 19.5% to 70.5 ± 15.5%, which is nearly the normal value (73.5 ± 
15.4%). As for safety, 11 patients reported a total of 17 adverse events (AE), 1 
of which was serious but unrelated to the study medication. The AE were mild or 
moderate. The safety laboratory data showed no statistically significant or 
otherwise relevant changes.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the formula Padma Digestin has a high 
tolerability and efficacy in FD symptoms and positively influences psychological 
well-being and thus quality of life. It therefore represents a much needed 
extension of the therapeutic repertoire in FD.

disease in the stages IIa and IIb].

Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is in about 90% of the cases caused 
by atherosclerosis. Since this can affect all arteries of the body, PAOD is 
considered an important indicator of cardiovascular events such as heart attack 
or stroke, and thus of the leading cause of death in the Western world. With the 
measurement of the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABI), a practicable method is 
available to diagnose the disease in routine practice. Besides lifestyle 
modifications, the mainstay of treatment of atherosclerosis includes also drug 
treatment of known risk factors. In case of a severe circulatory disorder with 
critical ischemia, a revascularization by angioplasty or surgical methods is 
imperative. If the walking distance is limited due to PAOD, we speak of 
intermittent claudication. Here, in addition to the interventional treatment 
(percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) / surgery), a conservative walking 
exercise can be performed. The supportive use of Padma 28 in the conservative 
treatment has a measurable effect with a significant extension of the maximum 
walking distance and poses an additive treatment option.

INTRODUCTION: This multicentre randomised controlled trial was designed to 
explore whether 6 weeks above-elbow cast (AEC) or 3 weeks AEC followed by 
3 weeks below-elbow cast (BEC) cause similar limitation of pronation and 
supination in non-reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children were randomly allocated to 6 weeks AEC or to 
3 weeks AEC followed by 3 weeks BEC. The primary outcome was limitation of 
pronation and supination after 6 months. The secondary outcomes were 
re-displacement of the fracture, complication rate, limitation of flexion and 
extension of wrist and elbow, cast comfort, cosmetics, complaints in daily life 
and assessment of radiographs.
RESULTS: A group of 23 children was treated with 6 weeks AEC and 24 children 
with 3 weeks AEC and 3 weeks BEC. The follow-up rate was 98 % with a mean 
follow-up of 7.0 months. The mean limitation of pronation and supination was 
23.3 ± 22.0 for children treated with AEC and 18.0 ± 16.9 for children treated 
with AEC and BEC. The other study outcomes were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Early conversion to BEC is safe in the treatment of non-reduced 
diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Multicentre randomised controlled trial, Level II.

Neck of femur fractures in the over 90s: a select group of patients who require 
prompt surgical intervention for optimal results.

BACKGROUND: Patients in the extremes of old age with a femoral neck fracture 
represent a challenging subgroup, and are thought to be associated with poorer 
outcomes due to increased numbers of comorbidities. Whilst many studies are 
aimed at determining the optimum time for surgical fixation, there is no agreed 
consensus for those over 90. The aim of this study is to report the surgical 
outcome of this population, to understand the role surgical timing may have on 
operative outcomes using the orthopaedic POSSUM scoring system and to identify 
whether medical optimization occurs during the period of admission before 
surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study; data was 
collected from two district general hospitals over 32 consecutive months. All 
patients aged 90 and above who were deemed suitable for surgical fixation were 
included. Each one had their orthopaedic POSSUM score calculated at admission 
and at surgery, using their computerised and paper medical records. Assessment 
of outcome was based on morbidity and mortality at 30 days.
RESULTS: A total of 146 consecutive patients above the age of 90 underwent 
surgery and were followed. The average age of the patients was 93 years, 123 (84 
%) were female and 23 (16%) male. Sixty-one patients were operated on within 24 
h from admission, 52 patients within 24 and 48 h and 33 had surgery after 48 h 
from admission. In total, 21 deaths (14.4%) were recorded and 81 patients 
(55.5%) had a post-operative complication within 30 days. The orthopaedic POSSUM 
scoring system predicted 30-day mortality in 23 patients and morbidity in 83 
patients. This gave observed to predicted ratios of 0.91 and 0.98 respectively. 
Overall, there was a small improvement in physiological scores taken just prior 
to surgery compared to those at admission. Mortality and morbidity rates were 
higher for those operated on or after 24 and 48-h cutoffs compared to those 
proceeding to surgery within 24 h (P = 0.071 and P = 0.021 respectively and P = 
0.048 and P = 0.00011 respectively). When stratified according to their POSSUM 
scores, patients with scores of 41+ and surgery after 48 h had a significantly 
higher mortality rate than if they had surgery earlier (P = 0.038). Morbidity 
rates rose after 24 h of surgical delay (P = 0.026). Patients with a total 
POSSUM score between 33 and 40 exhibited a higher morbidity after a 24-h delay 
to surgery (P = 0.0064).
CONCLUSION: As life expectancy increases, older patients are becoming commoner 
in our hospital systems. We believe the orthopaedic POSSUM scoring system can be 
used as an adjuvant tool in prioritising surgical need, and allow for a more 
impartial evaluation when changes to practice are made. Our findings show that 
timing of surgery has an important bearing on mortality and morbidity after hip 
surgery, and older patients with higher orthopaedic POSSUM scores are sensitive 
to delays in surgery.

Assessing biological aging: the origin of deficit accumulation.

Halifax, NS, B3H 1V7, Canada, arnold.mitnitski@dal.ca.

The health of individuals is highly heterogeneous, as is the rate at which they 
age. To account for such heterogeneity, we have suggested that an individual's 
health status can be represented by the number of health deficits (broadly 
defined by biological and clinical characteristics) that they accumulate. This 
allows health to be expressed in a single number: the frailty index (FI) is the 
ratio of the deficits present in a person to the total number of deficits 
considered (e.g. in a given database or experimental procedure). Changes in the 
FI characterize the rate of individual aging. The behavior of the FI is highly 
characteristic: it shows an age specific, nonlinear increase, (similar to 
Gompertz law), higher values in females, strong associations with adverse 
outcomes (e.g., mortality), and a universal limit to its increase (at FI ~0.7). 
These features have been demonstrated in dozens of studies. Even so, little is 
known about the origin of deficit accumulation. Here, we apply a stochastic 
dynamics framework to illustrate that the average number of deficits present in 
an individual is the product of the average intensity of the environmental 
stresses and the average recovery time. The age-associated increase in recovery 
time results in the accumulation of deficits. This not only explains why the 
number of deficits can be used to estimate individual differences in aging 
rates, but also suggests that targeting the recovery rate (e.g. by preventive or 
therapeutic interventions) will decrease the number of deficits that individuals 
accumulate and thereby benefit life expectancy.

Computed tomography x-ray tube life analysis: a multiyear study.

Erdi YE(1).

Author information:
(1)Diagnostic X-Ray Quality Assurance Section, Department of Medical Physics, at 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, USA.

PURPOSE: To assess and compare actual computed tomography (CT) x-ray tube life 
with manufacturer warranty coverage limits because prolonging the tube life 
helps to lower operating costs.
METHODS: Ten GE LightSpeed CT scanners with 40 Performix Ultra tube changes and 
3 GE VCT scanners with 10 Performix Pro tube changes were followed for 6 years. 
CT x-ray tube life measurements were performed by analyzing log files of the 
units after a tube change.
RESULTS: The Ultra tubes warranty coverage limit is 70 kAs or 12 months, 
whichever comes first. For Pro tubes, it is 6000 examinations or 12 months, 
whichever comes first. Measurements for the Performix Ultra CT x-ray tubes 
showed a range of 7 to 48 months and 16.7 to 239.9 kAs. Mean values for the 
Ultra CT x-ray tubes were 19.2 ± 12.5 months and 81.0 ± 45.4 kAs. Seven Ultra CT 
x-ray tubes did not meet the warranty coverage limits, with an average life of 8 
months and 48.1 kAs. For the Pro CT x-ray tubes, the measured logs indicated 
22.4 ± 9.6 months of CT x-ray tube life. All 10 Pro CT x-ray tubes exceeded 
company warranty coverage limits.
DISCUSSION: Although Pro tubes lasted longer, they acquired fewer scans than did 
Ultra tubes. A similar result was shown for current output.
CONCLUSION: Because the clinical demand for a CT scanner varies, it is difficult 
to determine the reason for the failed tubes. Mechanical, environmental, and 
usage factors can reduce the life expectancy of an x-ray tube.

Societal aging raises challenging ethical questions regarding the just 
distribution of health care between young and old. This article considers a 
proposal for age-based rationing of health care, which is based on the 
prudential life span account of justice between age groups. While important 
objections have been raised against the prudential life span account, it 
continues to dominate scholarly debates. This article introduces a new 
objection, one that develops out of the well-established disability critique of 
social contract theories. I show the implications of this critique for the 
prudential life span account and for the special case of age-group justice. The 
result is that age-based rationing based on the prudential life span approach is 
not supported, and that the prudential life span approach itself is not the best 
way to think about allocating health care between age groups. I propose an 
alternative approach that avoids the disability objection, and consider its 
implications for specific proposals for age-based rationing of health care.

Successful long-term intermittent hemodialysis in a patient with left 
ventricular assist device.

Sosa Barrios H, Palmer A, Khan T, Banner N, Duncan N.

Renal impairment is a frequent complication of cardio-renal syndrome that 
increases mortality and morbidity. This is even more likely when renal 
replacement therapy is required, precluding in many cases transplantation and 
seriously limiting life expectancy. We describe the first case of refractory 
heart failure in a patient with a ventricular assist device (LVAD) implanted as 
destination therapy. He underwent intermittent hemodialysis (HD) treatment as an 
outpatient with good quality of life.

State-specific healthy life expectancy at age 65 years--United States, 
2007-2009.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Collaborators: Frieden TR, Jaffe HW, Stephens JW, Cardo DM, Zaza S.

Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is a population health measure that combines 
mortality data with morbidity or health status data to estimate expected years 
of life in good health for persons at a given age. HLE accounts for quantity and 
quality of life and can be used to describe and monitor the health status of 
populations. HLE estimates for countries have been used for predicting future 
health service needs, evaluating health programs, and identifying trends and 
inequalities, but to date, few studies have reported HLE at the state level for 
the United States. To determine state-level estimates, CDC used data from the 
National Vital Statistics Systems (NVSS), U.S. Census Bureau, and Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to calculate HLEs for persons aged 65 
years, by sex and race, for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia 
(DC). Those calculations indicate that, during 2007-2009, females had a greater 
HLE than males at age 65 years in every state and DC. HLE was greater for whites 
than for blacks in all states from which sufficient data were available and DC, 
except in Nevada and New Mexico. These results can be used as a baseline for 
states to monitor changes in the HLE of persons aged 65 years as they age and 
identify health disparities among subpopulations.

Aging is a major risk factor for a large number of disorders and functional 
impairments. Therapeutic targeting of the aging process may therefore represent 
an innovative strategy in the quest for novel and broadly effective treatments 
against age-related diseases. The recent report of lifespan extension in mice 
treated with the FDA-approved mTOR inhibitor rapamycin represented the first 
demonstration of pharmacological extension of maximal lifespan in mammals. 
Longevity effects of rapamycin may, however, be due to rapamycin's effects on 
specific life-limiting pathologies, such as cancers, and it remains unclear if 
this compound actually slows the rate of aging in mammals. Here, we present 
results from a comprehensive, large-scale assessment of a wide range of 
structural and functional aging phenotypes, which we performed to determine 
whether rapamycin slows the rate of aging in male C57BL/6J mice. While rapamycin 
did extend lifespan, it ameliorated few studied aging phenotypes. A subset of 
aging traits appeared to be rescued by rapamycin. Rapamycin, however, had 
similar effects on many of these traits in young animals, indicating that these 
effects were not due to a modulation of aging, but rather related to 
aging-independent drug effects. Therefore, our data largely dissociate 
rapamycin's longevity effects from effects on aging itself.

BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding the most appropriate strategy to 
prevent venous thromboembolism following total joint arthroplasty. Our objective 
was to estimate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
costs per QALY gained using low-molecular-weight heparin compared with low-dose 
aspirin for two weeks after total knee or total hip arthroplasty in patients 
with no history of venous thromboembolism.
METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model with health states of healthy after 
surgery, no postphlebitic syndrome after venous thromboembolism, postphlebitic 
syndrome after venous thromboembolism, and survival after intracranial 
hemorrhage to compare treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin or aspirin 
(160 mg) for fourteen days after total knee arthroplasty or total hip 
arthroplasty in patients with an age of fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, 
seventy-five, eighty, or eighty-five years. We estimated lifetime costs, QALYs 
gained, and costs per QALY gained for both strategies, and applied a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 (2010 U.S. dollars) per QALY gained.
RESULTS: For patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty at the ages of 
fifty-five and seventy years, costs per QALY gained for low-molecular-weight 
heparin compared with aspirin were $315,000 and $1.4 million, respectively. For 
those undergoing total hip arthroplasty at the age of eighty or eighty-five 
years, aspirin cost less and saved more QALYs than low-molecular-weight heparin. 
For patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at the ages of fifty-five, 
seventy, and eighty-five years, costs per QALY gained with low-molecular-weight 
heparin were $36,000, $112,000, and $448,000, respectively. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses confirmed a low probability of low-molecular-weight heparin 
being cost-effective for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and for 
those with an age of eighty years or older undergoing total knee arthroplasty. 
For individuals younger than eighty years of age undergoing total knee 
arthroplasty, the cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin compared 
with aspirin is uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with no history of venous thromboembolism, aspirin is 
a cost-effective choice for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following total 
hip arthroplasty, but the preferred choice following total knee arthroplasty 
depends on age and is uncertain for those younger than eighty years old.

in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Given increasing rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in countries with 
intermediate incidence rates, the decision to implement population-based 
screening must consider the trade-off between high costs and a relatively low 
yield. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 strategies 
for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality 
of life, noncompliance, and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy in 
Iran.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with 
screening by each test. In this study, we populated the model with data from the 
ministry of health and published literature. We considered costs from the 
perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to the 2011 
Iranian Rial converted to US dollars. We focused on three tests of the 10 
strategies considered, currently being used for population screening in some 
Iranian provinces (Mazandaran Kerman, Golestan, Ardabil, and Tehran): 
low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually; fecal 
immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, performed every 10 
years.
RESULTS: These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 39%, 
60%, and 76% and mortality by 50%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, compared with no 
screening. These strategies generated ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios) of $9067, $654, and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), 
respectively. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of 
various parameters on the cost-effectiveness of screening. The results were 
robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded 
the greatest net health benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional 
levels of WTP (Willingness to Pay). Annual high-sensitivity fecal occult blood 
testing, such as a fecal immunochemical test, or colonoscopy every 10 years 
offer the best value for the money in Iran.

BACKGROUND: Araucariaceae are important forest trees of the southern hemisphere. 
Life expectancy of their seedlings can largely be reduced by fungal infections. 
In this study we have isolated and characterized such a fungus and investigated 
the potential of Streptomyces Actinobacteria from the respective rhizosphere to 
act as antagonists.
RESULTS: The pathogenic fungus from Araucaria angustifolia seeds was identified 
by morphological markers (pore-associated Woronin-bodies) as belonging to the 
Pezizomycotina. Molecular data identified the fungus as Neofusicoccum parvum 
(Botryosphaeriaceae). Co-cultures on agar of this fungus with certain 
streptomycete isolates from the rhizosphere, and from the surface of Araucaria 
roots significantly reduced the growth of the fungus. HPLC analysis of the agar 
yielded streptomycete-specific exudate compounds which were partly identified. 
There were differences in compounds between single (bacteria, fungus) and dual 
cultures (bacteria + fungus).
CONCLUSION: Streptomycetes from the rhizosphere of Araucariaceae produce 
exudates which can suppress the development of pathogenic fungi in their seeds.

Preferences and priorities for ongoing and end-of-life care: a qualitative study 
of older people with dementia resident in care homes.

Goodman C(1), Amador S, Elmore N, Machen I, Mathie E.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of 
Hertfordshire, UK. Electronic address: c.goodman@herts.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: The older person with dementia has a limited life expectancy and the 
dying trajectory can be protracted and unpredictable. For good end-of-life care, 
early communication, exploration of residents' wishes, and identification of 
someone who can represent them, are important. In care homes the timing of these 
discussions, and who is involved is variable. Person-centred approaches to 
dementia care assume that people with dementia can actively participate in 
decisions about their lives. Less well understood is how this can inform 
end-of-life care decision making and complement information provided in advance 
care plans completed prior to, or at the point of admission to a care home.
OBJECTIVES: To explore how older people with dementia discuss their priorities 
and preferences for end-of-life care.
METHODS: An exploratory, qualitative study that used guided conversations with 
18 people with dementia, living in six care homes. Participants were asked about 
their life in the care home, their health, thoughts for the future, and wishes 
surrounding end of life. Data were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: People with dementia's accounts of life in the care home, what they 
valued, and the impact of having dementia on how they participated in decision 
making, provided key insights into care preferences. Three linked themes that 
had relevance for thinking and talking about end of life were identified: 
"dementia and decision making", "everyday relationships" and "place and 
purpose". Older people with dementia's accounts of everyday experiences of care, 
key relationships with family and care home staff members and whether they 
accepted the care home as their home demonstrated what was important for them 
now and for the future.
CONCLUSION: For older people living with a diagnosis of dementia, the experience 
of living and dying in a care home is inextricably linked. End-of-life care 
planning and decision making by health care professionals, care home staff and 
family could be enriched by exploring and documenting the preoccupations, key 
relationships and wishes about everyday care of people with dementia.

In this paper the economic impact of controlling the Q fever epidemic in 
2007-2011 in the Netherlands is assessed. Whereas most of the long-term benefits 
of the implemented control programme stem from reduced disease burden and human 
health costs, the majority of short-term intervention costs were incurred in the 
dairy goat sector. The total intervention cost in agriculture amounted 
approximately 35,000 Euro per DALY occurred. By culling of infected animals, 
breeding prohibition and vaccination, the epidemic seems to be under control. As 
the dairy goat vaccination programme continues, future expenses in maintaining 
the current protected status are relatively low.

Gothenburg, Sweden.

The proportion of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) reported to 
convert to clinically definite multiple sclerosis varied between 30 and 75%. We 
studied the lifetime probability of remaining in the "CIS only" condition. The 
study was based on the longitudinally followed Gothenburg 1950-1964 incidence 
cohort (n = 306). Survival analysis revealed that 17.8% of 236 attack onset 
patients remained "CIS only". Patients with afferent (optic and sensory) 
symptoms had a better prognosis with approximately 30% of these patients 
remaining "CIS only". Patients who had experienced no relapse during the first 
25 years remained "CIS only" for the subsequent 25 years of follow-up.
