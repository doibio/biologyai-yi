AIM: To estimate rates of progression and to asssess the projected lifetime risk 
of blindness among treated eyes of juvenile-onset primary open glaucoma (JOAG) 
patients.
METHODS: Rates of change of the visual field index of JOAG patients (diagnosed 
between the age of 10-40 years), with at least 5 year follow up, were used to 
estimate the lifetime risk of perimetric blindness. Both the eyes of patients 
were included in the analysis wherever possible. Average life expectancy of the 
population was used to calculate the lifetime risk of perimetric blindness. A 
regression analysis of factors contributing to faster rates of progression was 
performed.
RESULTS: One hundred and two eyes of 54 patients were included in the study. 
Mean age at the time of baseline visual field was 26.6 ± 9.8 years 
(15-40 years). The average visual field index change per year was -0.9% (range 
-6.4 to +2.0% per year) and 18 eyes (17%) showed a progression greater than -2% 
per year. The cumulative risk of an eye losing 50% and 100% of its visual field 
index was 30% and 22% respectively over the patients' lifetime. The projected 
risk of bilateral blindness among JOAG patients over their lifetime was 10%. 
Long term IOP fluctuation was significantly associated with faster rates of 
progression (Odds ratio = 2.74; p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Though the rate of visual field deterioration with treatment, among 
juvenile glaucoma patients is lower compared to that among other types of 
primary glaucoma, the projected lifetime risk of perimetric blindness in these 
eyes is similar, despite the longer duration of disease in this age group.

The Price of a Helping Hand: Modeling the Outcomes and Costs of Bystander CPR.

Bouland AJ, Risko N, Lawner BJ, Seaman KG, Godar CM, Levy MJ.

OBJECTIVE: Early, high-quality, minimally interrupted bystander cardio-pulmonary 
resuscitation (BCPR) is essential for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. 
However, rates of bystander intervention remain low in many geographic areas. 
Community CPR programs have been initiated to combat these low numbers by 
teaching compression-only CPR to laypersons. This study examined bystander CPR 
and the cost-effectiveness of a countywide CPR program to improve 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival.
METHODS: A 2-year retrospective review of emergency medical services (EMS) run 
reports for adult nontraumatic cardiac arrests was performed using existing 
prehospital EMS quality assurance data. The incidence and success of bystander 
CPR to produce prehospital return of spontaneous circulation and favorable 
neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge were analyzed. The outcomes were 
paired with cost data for the jurisdiction's community CPR program to develop a 
cost-effectiveness model.
RESULTS: During the 23-month study period, a total of 371 nontraumatic adult 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurred, with a 33.4% incidence of bystander 
CPR. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for the community CPR program 
demonstrated a total cost of $22,539 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A 
significantly increased proportion of those who received BCPR also had an 
automated external defibrillator (AED) applied. There was no correlation between 
witnessed arrest and performance of BCPR. A significantly increased proportion 
of those who received BCPR were found to be in a shockable rhythm when the 
initial ECG was performed. In the home setting, the chances of receiving BCPR 
were significantly smaller, whereas in the public setting a nearly equal number 
of people received and did not receive BCPR. Witnessed arrest, AED application, 
public location, and shockable rhythm on initial ECG were all significantly 
associated with positive ROSC and neurologic outcomes. A home arrest was 
significantly associated with worse neurologic outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that a community CPR 
outreach program is a cost-effective means for saving lives when compared to 
other healthcare-related interventions. Bystander CPR showed a clear trend 
toward improving the neurologic outcome of survivors. The findings of this study 
indicate a need for additional research into the economic effects of bystander 
CPR.

BACKGROUND: There are no conclusive cost-effectiveness studies measuring the 
efficacy of salvage LT after liver resection (LR) and radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and compensated 
cirrhosis. The aim of the present study is to compare liver transplantation (LT) 
versus locoregional therapy plus salvage LT (to treat tumor recurrence) in 
patients with early HCC and compensated cirrhosis.
METHODS: Reference case: 55-year old male with HCC within Milan criteria and 
Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. The analysis was performed in two geographical cost 
settings: USA and Italy. Survival benefit measured in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs (C) in US$, incremental cost-effectiveness, willingness to 
pay, and net health benefit (NHB).
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, NHB of LT vs. LR and RFA was -1.7 and -1.3 
years for single tumor ≤3 cm, -1.2 and -0.7 for single nodules measuring 3.1-5 
cm and -0.7 and -0.7 for multi-nodular tumor ≤3 cm in Italy. In USA, NHB of LT 
versus LR and RFA were -1.2 and -0.8 years for single tumor ≤3 cm, -0.9 and -0.5 
for single nodules measuring 3.1-5 cm, and -0.5 and -0.4 for multi-nodular tumor 
≤ 3 cm. On the Monte Carlo simulation, only young patients with multi-nodular 
HCC and short waiting list time had a positive NHB. Salvage LT proved to be an 
ineffective cost strategy after RFA or LR.
CONCLUSION: In patients with HCC within Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A 
cirrhosis, LR and RFA were more cost-effective than LT. Salvage LT was not 
cost-effective.

Previous studies have shown that a "Preventive Exercise Program" (PREP) is 
cost-effective compared to the standard exercise program provided in "Usual 
Care" (UC) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. The current paper 
specifically estimates the cost-effectiveness of the TheraBite jaw 
rehabilitation device (TB) which is used as part of the PREP, compared to Speech 
Language Pathology (SLP) sessions as part of UC, and herewith intents to inform 
reimbursement discussions regarding the TheraBite device. Costs and outcomes 
[quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] of the TB compared to SLP were estimated 
using a Markov model of advanced head and neck cancer patients. Secondary 
outcome variables were trismus, feeding substitutes, facial pain, and pneumonia. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated from a health care 
perspective of the Netherlands, with a time horizon of 2 years. The total health 
care costs per patient were estimated to amount to €5,129 for the TB strategy 
and €6,915 for the SLP strategy. Based on the current data, the TB strategy 
yielded more quality-adjusted life-years (1.28) compared to the SLP strategy 
(1.24). Thus, the TB strategy seems more effective (+0.04) and less costly 
(-€1,786) than the SLP only strategy. At the prevailing threshold of 
€20,000/QALY the probability for the TB strategy being cost-effective compared 
to SLP was 70 %. To conclude, analysis of presently available data indicates 
that TB is expected to be cost-effective compared to SLP in a preventive 
exercise program for concomitant chemo-radiotherapy for advanced head and neck 
cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: Presentation of our experience in the treatment of anterior clinoidal 
meningiomas, including evaluation of factors that may affect early and long-term 
treatment outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty patients were operated with strategy of complete tumor resection 
using fronto-orbito-zygomatic approach. Outcomes were assessed by Glasgow 
Outcome Scale at discharge and by Karnofsky Performance Scale at follow-up.
RESULTS: There were 6 tumors in group I, 20 in group II, and 4 in group III 
according to Al-Mefty classification. Complete tumor resection (Simpson I or II) 
was achieved in 19 patients, incomplete resection (Simpson IV) in 11: due to 
strict tumor adhesion to cerebral arteries in 5 and tumor extension to cavernous 
sinus in 6 cases. Operative mortality was 6.7%. Visual acuity improved in six 
among nine patients with impaired vision but in no one among nine patients with 
blindness. Normal life activity (80-100 KPS) could be carried out by 88% 
patients at follow-up. Recurrence was observed in two (11.8%) patients after 
radical removal and progression of residual tumor in two (25%) after subtotal 
resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete tumor removal is possible with an acceptable risk of death 
and severe neurological deficits, except for cases with tumor extension to the 
cavernous sinus or strict tumor adhesion to cerebral arteries. Visual acuity 
improvement may be expected in two thirds of patients with impaired vision, but 
not in cases of blindness. In cases of incomplete tumor removal, use of 
stereotactic radiosurgery immediately after surgery seems justified.

Optimal management of the elderly patient with head and neck cancer: Issues 
regarding surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy.

Hospital, 115 25 Athens, Greece.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents the sixth most common malignancy and 
accounts for approximately 6% of new cancer cases annually worldwide. As life 
expectancy constantly increases, the onset of HNC in patients older than 65 
years of age at diagnosis is not rare and up to one fourth of cases occurs in 
patients older that 70 years at age. Because elderly cancer patients are 
severely under-represented in clinical trials, there is a clear need to address 
the particular aspects of this specific patient group, especially in the context 
of novel multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches. The frailty of elderly 
patients with HNC is attributed to the high incidence of smoking and alcohol 
abuse in this malignancy and the presence of substantial cardiovascular, 
respiratory or metabolic comorbidities. In the current work, I provide an 
overview of current and emerging treatment approaches, in elderly patients with 
HNC. In particular, I discuss modern surgical approaches that improve radical 
excision rates while preserving functionality, the incorporation of modern 
radiotherapeutic techniques and the introduction of novel chemotherapeutic 
combinations and molecular targeted agents in an effort to reduce toxicity 
without compromising efficacy. Finally, there is an urgent need to increase 
accrual and active participation of elderly patients with HNC in clinical 
trials, including biomarker evaluation in biopsy specimens towards an 
individualized therapeutic approach.

Sickle cell disease: renal manifestations and mechanisms.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) substantially alters renal structure and function, and 
causes various renal syndromes and diseases. Such diverse renal outcomes reflect 
the uniquely complex vascular pathobiology of SCD and the propensity of red 
blood cells to sickle in the renal medulla because of its hypoxic, acidotic, and 
hyperosmolar conditions. Renal complications and involvement in sickle cell 
nephropathy (SCN) include altered haemodynamics, hypertrophy, assorted 
glomerulopathies, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, impaired urinary 
concentrating ability, distal nephron dysfunction, haematuria, and increased 
risks of urinary tract infections and renal medullary carcinoma. SCN largely 
reflects an underlying vasculopathy characterized by cortical hyperperfusion, 
medullary hypoperfusion, and an increased, stress-induced vasoconstrictive 
response. Renal involvement is usually more severe in homozygous disease (sickle 
cell anaemia, HbSS) than in compound heterozygous types of SCD (for example HbSC 
and HbSβ(+)-thalassaemia), and is typically mild, albeit prevalent, in the 
heterozygous state (sickle cell trait, HbAS). Renal involvement contributes 
substantially to the diminished life expectancy of patients with SCD, accounting 
for 16-18% of mortality. As improved clinical care promotes survival into 
adulthood, SCN imposes a growing burden on both individual health and health 
system costs. This Review addresses the renal manifestations of SCD and focuses 
on their underlying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, being old is no longer synonymous with 
frailty, weakness, or poor health. Today, most people expect to maintain or 
promote their health by adopting healthy lifestyle habits.
PURPOSE: This study developed and tested the psychometric Geriatric Health 
Promotion (GHP) scale. The GHP scale is a multidimensional instrument that 
attempts to evaluate lifestyle patterns prevalent among senior citizens in 
Taiwan.
METHODS: Data used in this study were acquired from a large health-promotion 
study that targeted elderly residents of rural areas in Taiwan. All subjects 
were aged 65 years or older and resided in the four communities with the highest 
mean age ratios in the nation. Trained research assistants assisted the 
participants to answer the research instrument questions.
RESULTS: A total of 520 participants over 65 years of age (mean = 75.02 ± 6.04) 
were enrolled in this study. The initial draft of the GHP scale included 33 
items. After conducting the item analysis, correlation analysis, and factor 
analysis, the final draft of the GHP was reduced to 22 items. A six-factor 
solution with Varimax rotation offered the most parsimonious model, with health 
habits, community participation, health responsibilities, healthy diet, regular 
exercise, and oral health, explaining 68% of the total variance. The Cronbach's 
alpha for the developed model scored as high as .94, with a test-retest 
reliability of .72 (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The GHP scale is a valid self-report 
instrument for community-dwelling older adults. The GHP scale is easily 
administered in less than 10 minutes. We recommend that healthcare providers use 
the GHP scale to evaluate the effectiveness of health promotion programs 
targeting older adults.

There exists a conspicuous gap of knowledge about the organization of life at 
mesoscopic levels. Ultra-fast coherent diffractive imaging with X-ray 
free-electron lasers can probe structures at the relevant length scales and may 
reach sub-nanometer resolution on micron-sized living cells. Here we show that 
we can introduce a beam of aerosolised cyanobacteria into the focus of the Linac 
Coherent Light Source and record diffraction patterns from individual living 
cells at very low noise levels and at high hit ratios. We obtain two-dimensional 
projection images directly from the diffraction patterns, and present the 
results as synthetic X-ray Nomarski images calculated from the complex-valued 
reconstructions. We further demonstrate that it is possible to record 
diffraction data to nanometer resolution on live cells with X-ray lasers. 
Extension to sub-nanometer resolution is within reach, although improvements in 
pulse parameters and X-ray area detectors will be necessary to unlock this 
potential.

AIMS: To examine the cost-effectiveness of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) use 
during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) 
in treating coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was constructed with a lifetime horizon to 
compare costs and health outcomes between IVUS-guided PCI and PCI guided solely 
by angiography from an Italian healthcare payer perspective. The population 
examined included CAD patients undergoing PCI with DES. From a healthcare payer 
perspective, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per 
quality-adjusted life-year was negative in the base-case scenario (i.e., IVUS 
benefit assumed to persist beyond the first year). When IVUS benefit was assumed 
to be limited to the first year, the ICER increased to €9,624. This conclusion 
remained consistent even when scenarios varied regarding the duration of the 
device's effect. Furthermore, benefits of using IVUS were greater for patients 
with acute coronary syndrome, renal insufficiency, and diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Using IVUS with angiography is a dominant strategy in Italy, and 
results demonstrate that it is desirable to target those at a greater risk of 
restenosis (i.e., patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and acute 
coronary syndrome), who tend to benefit more from accurate stent implantation. 
Further information is necessary regarding the long-term benefits of IVUS, 
however sensitivity analysis presented in this research demonstrates a strong 
argument supporting the cost-effectiveness of IVUS.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a 
life expectancy of less than 1 year. Therefore, it is important to maximize 
their quality of life and find a tool that can more accurately predict survival.
MATERIALS: The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) is used to predict survival 
for patients with advanced disease based on functional dimensions. The value of 
the PPS in ambulatory patients with cancer has not been examined to date. The 
Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) measures six major symptoms and their effect on 
symptomatic distress and activity. We evaluated 62 patients with stage III or IV 
NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale Score ≥1 at baseline 
in a thoracic oncology clinic. In all, 62 patients had LCSS and PPS evaluated at 
baseline and 54 patients had 4-week follow-up using LCSS, PPS, and ECOG.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed baseline and follow-up. Mean age was 63.7 
years. Sixty-three percent were receiving chemotherapy at evaluation. Seventeen 
patients died. Mean baseline measures were LCSS 6.18 (1-14); PPS 66.6 (40-90); 
and ECOG 1.82 (1-4). Censored survival times were calculated from enrollment of 
the first patient for 380 days. A proportional hazardous model was computed for 
survival status. Hazard ratios for death were 1.25 (P = .013) for LCSS, 2.12 (P 
= .027) for ECOG, and 1.02 for PPS (P = .49).
CONCLUSIONS: The LCSS predicted prognosis best in this study. The PPS did not 
accurately predict prognosis in our patient population.

BACKGROUND: The EQ-5D and SF-6D are 2 health-related quality-of-life indexes 
that provide preference-weighted measures for use in cost-effectiveness 
analyses.
METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Care Outcomes Research and 
Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium included the EQ-5D and SF-12v2 in their survey 
of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Utilities were calculated from 
patient-provided scores for each domain of the EQ-5D or the SF-6D. Utilities 
were calculated for categories of cancer type, stage, and treatment.
RESULTS: There were 5015 enrolled lung cancer patients with a baseline survey in 
CanCORS; 2396 (47.8%) completed the EQ-5D, and 2344 (46.7%) also completed the 
SF-12v2. The mean (standard deviation) utility from the EQ-5D was 0.78 (0.18), 
and from the SF-6D (derived from SF-12v2) was 0.68 (0.14). The EQ-5D 
demonstrated a ceiling effect, with 20% of patients reporting perfect scores, 
translating to a utility of 1.0. No substantial SF-6D floor effects were noted. 
Utilities increased with age and decreased with stage and comorbidities. 
Patient-reported (EQ-5D) visual analog scale scores for health status had a 
moderate (r = 0.48, p < 0.0001) positive correlation with utilities. A subset (n 
= 1474) completed follow-up EQ-5D questionnaires 11-13 months after diagnosis. 
Among these patients, there was a nonsignificant decrease in mean utility for 
stage IV and an increase in mean utility for stages I, II, and III.
CONCLUSION: This study generated a catalog of community-weighted utilities 
applicable to societal-perspective cost-effectiveness analyses of lung cancer 
interventions and compared utilities based on the EQ-5D and SF-6D. Potential 
users of these scores should be aware of the limitations and think carefully 
about their use in specific studies.

IMPORTANCE: Despite the potential importance of understanding excess mortality 
among people with mental disorders, no comprehensive meta-analyses have been 
conducted quantifying mortality across mental disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality among 
people with mental disorders and examine differences in mortality risks by type 
of death, diagnosis, and study characteristics.
DATA SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science from 
inception through May 7, 2014, including references of eligible articles. Our 
search strategy included terms for mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, 
serious mental illness, and severe mental illness), specific diagnoses (eg, 
schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), and mortality. We 
also used Google Scholar to identify articles that cited eligible articles.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language cohort studies that reported a mortality 
estimate of mental disorders compared with a general population or controls from 
the same study setting without mental illness were included. Two reviewers 
independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, and articles. Of 2481 studies 
identified, 203 articles met the eligibility criteria and represented 29 
countries in 6 continents.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One reviewer conducted a full abstraction of all 
data, and 2 reviewers verified accuracy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality estimates (eg, standardized mortality 
ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and years of potential life 
lost) comparing people with mental disorders and the general population or 
people without mental disorders. We used random-effects meta-analysis models to 
pool mortality ratios for all, natural, and unnatural causes of death. We also 
examined years of potential life lost and estimated the population attributable 
risk of mortality due to mental disorders.
RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, the pooled relative risk of mortality among 
those with mental disorders (from 148 studies) was 2.22 (95% CI, 2.12-2.33). Of 
these, 135 studies revealed that mortality was significantly higher among people 
with mental disorders than among the comparison population. A total of 67.3% of 
deaths among people with mental disorders were due to natural causes, 17.5% to 
unnatural causes, and the remainder to other or unknown causes. The median years 
of potential life lost was 10 years (n = 24 studies). We estimate that 14.3% of 
deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million deaths each year, are attributable 
to mental disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These estimates suggest that mental disorders rank 
among the most substantial causes of death worldwide. Efforts to quantify and 
address the global burden of illness need to better consider the role of mental 
disorders in preventable mortality.

A HPLC-SRM-MS based method for the detection and quantification of methotrexate 
in urine at doses used in clinical practice for patients with rheumatological 
disease: a potential measure of adherence.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that causes significant 
disability and reduced life expectancy. The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) 
is first-line therapy for RA when used weekly at low doses (5-25 mg). However, 
the true rate of adherence to MTX is uncertain. This is in part due to the 
different methods of measurement of adherence employed with no biochemical test 
currently available to determine adherence to low dose MTX. Common methods of 
MTX measurement include immunoassays in patients with high dose therapy, but 
these assays cross-react with MTX metabolites and lack the sensitivity required 
to measure adherence to low dose MTX. HPLC-SRM-MS (selected reaction 
monitoring-mass spectrometry) has several theoretical advantages over 
immunoassays with improved specificity, minimal cross-reaction and higher 
sensitivity. The aim of this study was to develop an assay to measure MTX and 
its major metabolite 7-OH-MTX in urine as a tool to monitor adherence to low 
dose MTX in clinic. As a proof of concept, urine samples from 4 participants 
with RA were measured after directly observed therapy. The assay showed improved 
sensitivity compared to that reported by immunoassays, with low carryover and 
high within-run precision. In participant samples, MTX was measurable in the 
urine for up to 105 hours after administration and 7-OH-MTX was detectable up to 
98 hours after administration, suggesting that this assay is suitable for the 
measurement of adherence to therapy. The assay requires minimal sample 
preparation and can be adopted by other laboratories with minimal study set up.

Aging is the principal demographic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), the 
most common neurodegenerative disorder. Klotho is a key modulator of the aging 
process and, when overexpressed, extends mammalian lifespan, increases synaptic 
plasticity, and enhances cognition. Whether klotho can counteract deficits 
related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, is unknown. Here we show that 
elevating klotho expression decreases premature mortality and network 
dysfunction in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, which 
simulate key aspects of AD. Increasing klotho levels prevented depletion of NMDA 
receptor (NMDAR) subunits in the hippocampus and enhanced spatial learning and 
memory in hAPP mice. Klotho elevation in hAPP mice increased the abundance of 
the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR in postsynaptic densities and NMDAR-dependent 
long-term potentiation, which is critical for learning and memory. Thus, 
increasing wild-type klotho levels or activities improves synaptic and cognitive 
functions, and may be of therapeutic benefit in AD and other cognitive 
disorders.

Nacional de Rosario. Argentina.

Biphosphonate-associated maxillary bone osteonecrosis (BPMO) is a complication 
related to nitrogen-containing biphosphonate therapy. This adverse effect 
occasionally appears in patients who are administered biphosphonates through 
intravenous infusion for the treatment of cancer involving bone metastases. It 
can also present, in a lesser degree, in patients who take these drugs orally 
for the treatment of osteoporosis. Lately, there has been an increase in the 
number of cases of osteopenia and osteoporosis due to the increasing life 
expectancy of the world's population. In our country, a risk group composed 
mainly of older women who have been diagnosed with osteopenia or osteoporosis, 
and submitted to the continuous action of oral biphosphonates, is emerging. In 
this paper we present 18 cases of BPMO associated to the use of oral 
biphosphonates, diagnosed and treated in the Department of Stomatology of the 
School or Dentistry at Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina. A protocol 
was designed in which the following information was recorded: age and sex of the 
patients, the original disease which led to therapy with oral biphosphonates, 
the drugs used and the period in which those drugs were administered, the 
clinical features and location of the lesions, together with triggering factors. 
Key words:Maxillary osteonecrosis, mandibular osteonecrosis, oral 
biphosphonates, alendronate, ibandronate.

Improvement in animal disease control and prevention is dependent on several 
factors including farmers' uptake of new technologies and skills, particularly 
in developing countries. Extension is the means by which information about these 
technologies and skills is delivered to farmers, in order that they can use this 
knowledge to improve farming practices and their quality of life. This implies a 
shift from traditional methods to new science-based methods of production. 
However, in many developing countries farmers are illiterate and unable to 
understand written outcomes of scientific research. This paper summarizes 
approaches to communicate epidemiological findings and reports on experiences 
obtained from a research project in Myanmar, where results from epidemiological 
field investigations and intervention studies were 'translated' in an 
understandable manner to village communities. Rural chicken farmers were the 
central focus of this extension work and simple and sustainable methods to 
improve the health and production of scavenging chicken flocks were promoted. 
Unique extension materials transformed scientific outputs published in 
international journals into clear pictographic messages comprehendible by 
villagers, while maintaining country-specific, traditional, religious and public 
perspectives. Benefits, difficulties and pitfalls in using extension methods to 
communicate advice on preventive veterinary medicine measures in different 
cross-cultural settings are discussed and guidelines on how to distribute 
epidemiological research results to illiterate farmers are provided.

[Management of cardiovascular risk in the elderly patient].

[Article in French]

Benoît F.

The management of cardiovascular risk in elderly patients should take into 
account the complexity that characterizes them, including physiological changes, 
comorbidities, as well as the individual's life expectancy. Up to 70-75 years 
old the guideline for the cardiovascular risk management is well structured. If 
the estimated risk is determined by using the "SCORE" model or cardiovascular 
prevention algorithm, the treatment is based on the importance of the risk. 
Recommendations beyond 75 years of age are not as clear. Although, we have a 
growing number of studies used to treat older patients, there are only a few 
recommendations for extreme old ages. The major modifiable risk factors are 
smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and obesity. For cardiovascular 
events the impact of the risk factors changes with age and influence the 
therapeutic management of the risk factors. Some interventions beneficial to 
young patients may be deleterious to the elderly. In addition, it is better 
defined for elderly patients with few comorbidities, and greater than 10 years 
life expectancy, because it tends to model the guidelines known to patients who 
are younger than 70 years old. This is not true for other patient profiles where 
only a few recommendations can guide us for optimal care.

Effects of substances on serum zinc levels in postmenopausal women.

Jasińska M, Mroczek B, Kotwas A, Baczkowski T, Wieder-Huszla S, Szkup-Jabłońska 
M, Grochans E, Karakiewicz B, Starczewski A.

INTRODUCTION: Demographic facts and forecasts about lengthening life expectancy 
motivate to systematize the knowledge of health problems experienced by women at 
the age of 50 and older. It refers to the whole health policy including health 
economics. Longer female life spans cause that an increasing number of women 
suffer from health problems associated with the perimenopausal period, and 
become health care recipients. Also a shift of retirement age is the reason to 
take interdisciplinary actions for women's health and quality of life. This 
study describes a decline in the levels of many bioelements in hair, urine and 
blood serum, which progresses with age. It not only correlates with a decrease 
in the synthesis and secretion of estrogen, but also environmental pollution, 
unhealthy lifestyle and the use of substances.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between 
serum zinc levels in postmenopausal women and such variables as the use of 
substances (cigarettes, alcohol) and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Material 
and method: The study was conducted among 152 healthy women being 1-16 years 
after menopause. The women were divided into study group (MHT users) and control 
group (MHT non-users). A sub-division criterion was the use of substances 
(cigarettes, alcohol). Serum zinc levels were determined in all women. Results: 
The use of substances significantly contributed to the lowering of serum zinc 
levels in postmenopausal women. MHT users had statistically higher average zinc 
levels in blood serum, which referred both to smokers and consumers of alcohol 
and those who did not use these substances.
CONCLUSIONS: (1) The use-of substances (cigarettes, alcohol) contributes to the 
lowering of zinc levels in blood serum. (2) MHT positively affects serum zinc 
levels in postmenopausal women regardless of whether they use substances 
(cigarettes, alcohol) or not.

Currently, there is no research in Australia that systematically investigates 
the underlying beliefs for mothers' decisions regarding their young child's 
nutritional needs based on current guidelines. We aimed to determine, using a 
Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) belief-based approach, key beliefs that guide 
mothers' decisions with regards to: (a) providing their child with a wide range 
of foods from the five food groups ('healthy eating'); and (b) limiting their 
child's intake of 'discretionary choices' (e.g. lollies). Mothers (N = 197, M 
age = 34.39, SD = 5.65) completed a main questionnaire either online or on hard 
copy (paper-based), with a 1-week phone follow-up of the target behaviours 
(N = 161). Correlations and multiple regression analyses were conducted, and a 
number of key behavioural, normative, and control beliefs emerged for both 
healthy eating and discretionary choice behaviours. For healthy eating, mothers 
identified behavioural beliefs 'improving my child's health' and 'resistance 
from my child'; normative beliefs 'other family members' and 'spouse/partner'; 
and control beliefs 'child's food preferences'. For discretionary choices, 
behavioural beliefs 'maintain consistent energy levels in my child' for 
intentions, and 'give my child their required nutritional intake'; normative 
beliefs 'spouse/partner', 'healthcare professionals' and 'friends'; and control 
beliefs 'child's food preferences' were identified. These findings can inform 
the development of future intervention programmes aimed at modifying mothers' 
child feeding practices to encourage healthy eating and limit discretionary 
choice intake and, ultimately, increase the life expectancy of the current 
generation of children.
