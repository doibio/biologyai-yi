In Caenorhabditis elegans, removing germ cells slows aging and extends life. 
Here we show that transcription factors that extend life and confer protection 
to age-related protein-aggregation toxicity are activated early in adulthood in 
response to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a shift in sulfur 
metabolism. Germline loss triggers H2S production, mitochondrial biogenesis, and 
a dynamic pattern of ROS in specific somatic tissues. A cytoskeletal protein, 
KRI-1, plays a key role in the generation of H2S and ROS. These kri-1-dependent 
redox species, in turn, promote life extension by activating SKN-1/Nrf2 and the 
mitochondrial unfolded-protein response, respectively. Both H2S and, remarkably, 
kri-1-dependent ROS are required for the life extension produced by low levels 
of the superoxide-generator paraquat and by a mutation that inhibits 
respiration. Together our findings link reproductive signaling to mitochondria 
and define an inducible, kri-1-dependent redox-signaling module that can be 
invoked in different contexts to extend life and counteract proteotoxicity.

Cystic fibrosis is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder, 
with highest prevalence in Europe, North America, and Australia. The disease is 
caused by mutation of a gene that encodes a chloride-conducting transmembrane 
channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 
which regulates anion transport and mucociliary clearance in the airways. 
Functional failure of CFTR results in mucus retention and chronic infection and 
subsequently in local airway inflammation that is harmful to the lungs. CFTR 
dysfunction mainly affects epithelial cells, although there is evidence of a 
role in immune cells. Cystic fibrosis affects several body systems, and 
morbidity and mortality is mostly caused by bronchiectasis, small airways 
obstruction, and progressive respiratory impairment. Important comorbidities 
caused by epithelial cell dysfunction occur in the pancreas (malabsorption), 
liver (biliary cirrhosis), sweat glands (heat shock), and vas deferens 
(infertility). The development and delivery of drugs that improve the clearance 
of mucus from the lungs and treat the consequent infection, in combination with 
correction of pancreatic insufficiency and undernutrition by multidisciplinary 
teams, have resulted in remarkable improvements in quality of life and clinical 
outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis, with median life expectancy now older 
than 40 years. Innovative and transformational therapies that target the basic 
defect in cystic fibrosis have recently been developed and are effective in 
improving lung function and reducing pulmonary exacerbations. Further small 
molecule and gene-based therapies are being developed to restore CFTR function; 
these therapies promise to be disease modifying and to improve the lives of 
people with cystic fibrosis.

Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in ovarian cancer clinical trials-lost 
opportunities and lessons learned.

Despite increased recognition of the value of including patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) as important end points in phase III clinical trials, there has 
been a lack of pre-specified PRO hypotheses and shortcomings with the analyses 
and interpretation of PROs in many ovarian cancer trials. This paper discusses 
and provides examples of the so-called lost opportunities in ovarian cancer 
trials. These include: (i) no clear pre-specified PRO hypotheses; (ii) PRO end 
points not included; (iii) insensitive PRO end point selection; (iv) collection 
of poor-quality PRO data not suitable for analysis; (v) differences in PROs 
between treatment arms ignored; and (vi) poor reporting quality. We can learn 
from the past and with relatively little additional effort, improve the 
collection and interpretation of PRO data in future ovarian cancer trials. The 
importance of doing so is underpinned by recent initiatives to improve the 
standard and usefulness of PRO data in clinical trials. These include the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for PROs to support labelling claims, the 
European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO 
MCBS), the International Society for Quality-of-Life Research PRO reporting 
guidance and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Clinical Trials 
(CONSORT)-PRO-extension statement which includes a checklist of recommended 
items to include in PRO sections of trial protocols. Promoting the importance of 
hypothesis-driven PROs in ovarian cancer clinical trials will lead to 
improvements in the design of these trials and the interpretation of their 
results.

OBJECTIVES: Antiretroviral combination therapy of patients infected with HIV has 
greatly increased their life expectancy. Hence, the treatment of HIV-related 
long-term complications and age-related comorbidities has become more important. 
Reported incidence rates of erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) are increasing in HIV-positive patients, potentially 
requiring treatment with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil or 
tadalafil. In vitro, the NNRTI rilpivirine is both a pregnane X receptor agonist 
and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor. Clinical data concerning the potential 
effects of rilpivirine coadministration on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A 
substrate tadalafil are lacking.
METHODS: We enrolled 20 healthy volunteers in an open-label, two-part, one-arm 
Phase I clinical trial to investigate acute and chronic effects of multiple 
doses of 25 mg of oral rilpivirine on single-dose and steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of multiple oral 20 mg doses of tadalafil. CYP3A activity was 
measured simultaneously with the oral midazolam microdose test.
RESULTS: We did not observe a change of tadalafil single-dose and steady-state 
exposure or of CYP3A activity measured at initiation, during maintenance and 
upon discontinuation of rilpivirine treatment after single-dose and chronic 
administration of rilpivirine.
CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil can be combined with rilpivirine without dose adjustment 
or drug monitoring in HIV patients with ED or PAH. Rilpivirine at daily 
therapeutic doses of 25 mg does not induce or inhibit CYP3A-dependent drug 
metabolism.

With the increasing average life expectancy of human beings, the need to cater 
geriatric patients is ever increasing. Complete dentures are an indispensable 
tool in this regard. The loose and unstable lower complete denture owing to 
residual ridge resorption is one of the most common problems faced by edentulous 
patients. Dental implant retained overdentures have emerged as an efficient 
treatment modality for such patients. Though useful, not every patient is a 
suitable candidate to go for conventional implant-borne prosthesis, limitation 
being the available bone width. In such cases, mini implants may be used for 
augmenting the retention of the dentures and improving the quality of life of 
patients. In this case series, rehabilitation of three compromised cases with 
mini implant retained overdentures have been described wherein patients are 
experiencing instability of lower denture due to thin resorbed mandibular 
ridges. In one of the cases, three mini implants placed in A, C, and E position 
were splinted using a cemented bar to retain the mandibular denture. The other 
two cases were rehabilitated using unsplinted ball type one piece mini implants 
placed in A, C, and E position in one case and B and D position in another case. 
Though splinted bar design should be preferred but the lack of available 
vertical space precluded the utilization of bar in other two cases. The results 
were found to be satisfactory with no complications reported during a follow-up 
period of over 3 years in all the cases.

BACKGROUND: Mice lacking glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein (Glmp (gt/gt) 
mice) have liver fibrosis as the predominant phenotype due to chronic liver 
injury. The Glmp (gt/gt) mice grow and reproduce at the same rate as their 
wild-type siblings. Life expectancy is around 18 months.
METHODS: Wild-type and Glmp (gt/gt) mice were studied between 1 week and 
18 months of age. Livers were analyzed using histological, immunohistochemical, 
biochemical, and qPCR analyses.
RESULTS: It was shown that Glmp (gt/gt) mice were not born with liver injury; 
however, it appeared shortly after birth as indicated by excess collagen 
expression, deposition of fibrous collagen in the periportal areas, and 
increased levels of hydroxyproline in Glmp (gt/gt) liver. Liver functional tests 
indicated a chronic, mild liver injury. Markers of inflammation, fibrosis, 
apoptosis, and modulation of extracellular matrix increased from an early age, 
peaking around 4 months of age and followed by attenuation of these signals. To 
compensate for loss of hepatocytes, the oval cell compartment was activated, 
with the highest activity of the oval cells detected at 3 months of age, 
suggesting insufficient hepatocyte proliferation in Glmp (gt/gt) mice around 
this age. Although constant proliferation of hepatocytes and oval cells 
maintained adequate hepatic function in Glmp (gt/gt) mice, it also resulted in a 
higher frequency of liver tumors in older animals.
CONCLUSIONS: The Glmp (gt/gt) mouse is proposed as a model for slowly 
progressing liver fibrosis and possibly as a model for a yet undescribed human 
lysosomal disorder.

Our recent study reported an interesting finding that tumor cells can actively 
manipulate host immune function to facilitate tumor immune escape through the 
secretion of microRNAs (miRNAs). As an extension of this finding, we showed that 
blockage of the function of tumor-secreted miRNAs represents an effective 
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: After improvements in various cancer treatments, life expectancy has 
been raised, but success in treatment causes loss of fertility in many of the 
survived young men. Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissues or cells 
introduced as the only way to preserve fertility. However, freezing has some 
harmful effects. Melatonin, a pineal gland hormone, has receptors in 
reproductive systems of different species. It is assumed that melatonin has free 
radical scavenger properties.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of melatonin on the 
cryopreserved testicular cells in mouse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells from 7- 10 days old NMRI mice testes were isolated 
using two step enzymatic digestion. The testicular cells were divided into two 
groups randomly and cryopreserved in two different freezing media with and 
without the addition of 100 µm melatonin. Finally, apoptosis of the cells was 
assayed by flow cytometry. Also, lactate dehydrogenase activity test was 
performed to assess the cytotoxicity.
RESULTS: The results of lactate dehydrogenase showed the nearly cytotoxic effect 
of melatonin. The results of flow cytometry showed increase in apoptosis in the 
cryopreserved cells in the media containing melatonin compared to the control 
group.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that melatonin has an apoptotic effect on 
cryopreserved mouse testicular cells.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) in China attributable to ambient ozone pollution in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Based on the results of the China Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 
2013, the population attributable fractions was used to analyze the deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of COPD attributable to ambient ozone 
pollution in all provinces (not including Taiwan, China) in 1990 and 2013, and 
to compare changes of the attributable disease burden in 1990 and 2013.
RESULTS: In 2013, 7.4% (95% uncertainty interval (95% UI): 6.1%-8.6%) of COPD 
were attributable to ambient ozone pollution, with the highest rate in Hebei 
province (15.0%, 95%UI: 12.0%-18.7%) and the lowest in Heilongjiang province 
(2.8%,95%UI: 0.9%-5.3%). In 2013, 67 485 COPD deaths in China were due to 
ambient ozone pollution, with the highest number in Sichuan province (11 929) 
and in China lowest in Macao (11). A total of 1.168 million DALYs caused by COPD 
were due to ambient ozone pollution, with the highest in Sichuan province (0.189 
million) and lowest in Macao (257.4). In 2013, the DALY per 100 000 population 
caused by COPD due to ambient ozone pollution after age standardization was 
lowest in Heilongjiang province (21.9), Shanghai (26.7), Beijing (38.4), Tianjin 
(39.3), and Jilin province (39.7) and highest in Sichuan province (206.4), 
Qinghai province (202.5), Guizhou province (175.3), and Gansu province (171.4). 
DALYs caused by COPD attributable to ambient ozone pollution increased with age 
(0.144 million person years for ages 15-49 years, 0.43 million person years for 
age 50-69 years and 0.594 million person years for age 70 years and above), 
which were higher in men than in women (0.708 million person years for men and 
0.459 million person years for women in 2013). Deaths of COPD attributable to 
ambient ozone pollution were 49 514 and 67 485 in 1990 and 2013, respectively. 
DALYs caused by COPD attributable to ozone pollution totaled 0.894 million and 
1.168 million person years in 1990 and 2013, respectively. Ambient ozone 
pollution-related deaths and DALYs increased 36.3% and 30.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with 1990, the disease burden of COPD in 2013 attributed to 
ambient ozone pollution in China increased substantially. Ambient ozone 
pollution caused great losses among Chinese residents. More attention should be 
directed toward western provinces with a particularly high disease burden due to 
ambient ozone pollution.

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is an increasingly appealing tool for 
evaluating and comparing health-related interventions in resource-limited 
settings. The goal is to inform decision-makers regarding the health benefits 
and associated costs of alternative interventions, helping guide allocation of 
limited resources by prioritising interventions that offer the most health for 
the least money. Although only one component of a more complex decision-making 
process, CEAs influence the distribution of health-care resources, directly 
influencing morbidity and mortality for the world's most vulnerable populations. 
However, CEA-associated measures are frequently setting-specific valuations, and 
CEA outcomes may violate ethical principles of equity and distributive justice. 
We examine the assumptions and analytical tools used in CEAs that may conflict 
with societal values. We then evaluate contextual features unique to 
resource-limited settings, including the source of health-state utilities and 
disability weights, implications of CEA thresholds in light of economic 
uncertainty, and the role of external donors. Finally, we explore opportunities 
to help align interpretation of CEA outcomes with values and budgetary 
constraints in resource-limited settings. The ethical implications of CEAs in 
resource-limited settings are vast. It is imperative that CEA outcome summary 
measures and implementation thresholds adequately reflect societal values and 
ethical priorities in resource-limited settings.

We aimed to assess whether a twice daily assisted exercise interventional 
program will have a greater effect on bone strength compared to a once daily 
intervention or no intervention in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. 
Thirty-four very VLBW preterm infants (mean BW 1217 ± 55 g and mean gestational 
age 28.6 ± 1.1 weeks) were randomly assigned into one of three study groups: 
twice daily interventions (n = 13), a once daily intervention (n = 11), and no 
intervention (control, n = 10). The intervention was initiated at a mean of 
8 ± 2.4 days of life and continued for 4 weeks. It included passive extension 
and flexion range-of-motion exercise of the upper and lower extremities. Bone 
strength was measured at enrollment and after 2 and 4 weeks using quantitative 
ultrasound of tibial bone speed of sound (SOS, Sunlight Omnisense™). At 
enrollment, the mean bone SOS was comparable between the twice daily 
interventions, once daily intervention and control groups (2918 ± 78, 
2943 ± 119, and 2910 ± 48 m/s, respectively). As expected, the bone SOS declined 
in all groups during the study period (-23.6 ± 24, -68.8 ± 28, and 
-115.8 ± 30 m/s, respectively, p < 0.05), with a significantly attenuated 
decrease in bone strength in the twice daily intervention group (p = 0.03). A 
twice daily intervention program of assisted range-of-motion exercise attenuates 
the decrease in bone strength and may decrease the risk of osteopenia and future 
fractures in VLBW preterm infants.

BACKGROUND: Current knowledge about long-term economic consequences of 
Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy (ITB Therapy®) is incomplete.
METHODS: A markov model was developed to estimate long-term clinical and 
economic outcomes with ITB Therapy® and conventional medical management of 
severe refractory non-focal disabling spasticity. Clinical and cost inputs were 
obtained through a non-interventional, prospective, observational study in a 
Spanish neurorehabilitation hospital.
RESULTS: ITB Therapy® increased remaining lifetime costs by €35,605 and resulted 
in a gain of 1.06 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), thus showing an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €33,619/QALY gained. In 
alternative scenarios, reflecting other clinical settings and management 
options, considerably lower ICER values were obtained. In particular, 
opportunities were identified to improve efficiency by setting clinically and 
economically sound targets for post-operation length of stay.
CONCLUSION: In the Spanish setting, ITB Therapy® resulted in an ICER close to 
€30,000/QALY gained; potential ways to reduce costs and further enhance 
efficiency can be identified.

Degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS) is an important cause of mitral stenosis, 
developing secondary to severe mitral annular calcification. With the increase 
in life expectancy and improved access to health care, more patients with DMS 
are likely to be encountered in developed nations. These patients are generally 
elderly with multiple comorbidities and often are high-risk candidates for 
surgery. The mainstay of therapy in DMS patients is medical management with 
heart rate control and diuretic therapy. Surgical intervention might be delayed 
until symptoms are severely limiting and cannot be managed by medical therapy. 
Mitral valve surgery is also challenging in these patients because of the 
presence of extensive calcification. Hence, there is a need to develop an 
alternative percutaneous treatment approach for patients with DMS who are 
otherwise inoperable or at high risk for surgery. In this review, we summarize 
the available data on the epidemiology of DMS and diagnostic considerations and 
current treatment strategies for these patients.

The objectives of this study are: (1) to estimate the expected health outcomes 
of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) and other non-stimulant 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications and (2) to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of AAPs compared to other non-stimulant ADHD medications. 
We used decision analysis to compare three alternatives for treating children 
and adolescents with ADHD who failed initial stimulant treatment: (1) AAPs, (2) 
a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine), and (3) selective 
α2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine and guanfacine). Probability estimates and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) weights were derived from a literature review. 
Cost-effectiveness was estimated using the expected health outcomes derived from 
the decision analysis and expected costs from the literature. The study was 
conducted from the third-party payer perspective, and the study period was 
1 year. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation 
were performed. Over the course of 1 year of ADHD pharmacotherapy, the highest 
QALY was for clonidine/guanfacine (expected QALY = 0.95) followed by atomoxetine 
(expected QALY = 0.94). Atypical antipsychotics yielded the lowest health 
outcome with an expected QALY of 0.84. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the 
AAP strategy was dominated as it was less effective and more costly than other 
two strategies. Compared to clonidine/guanfacine, AAPs provided lower QALYs 
(0.11 QALY lost) at an additional cost of $2186 on average. Compared to 
atomoxetine, AAPs resulted in 0.10 QALYs lost at an additional cost of $2186. In 
this decision analysis model, AAPs provide lower expected health outcomes than 
other ADHD medications in children and adolescents who failed prior stimulant 
therapy. Furthermore, AAPs were not a cost-effective option.

This study provides the first contribution of the biology and life table of 
Aphis forbesi Weed, 1889 (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an important strawberry pest 
throughout the world. This species lives in the crown and leaf petioles of the 
plant. It is difficulty to rear this species in laboratory due to 
protocooperation with ants observed only in the field. We studied the life cycle 
of A. forbesi on the leaves of the Albion strawberry cultivar at 25 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 
10% relative humidity, and a 12-h photophase. The experiment was randomised with 
100 replicates. The parameters of the fertility life table were calculated using 
TabVida. In the population studied, 25% and 46% had four and three instars, 
respectively. A mean of 1.43 nymphs per female per day was generated. The mean 
reproductive period was seven days and the mean longevity was 10 days. In every 
11 days there is a generation of A. forbesi, where each female has the potential 
to generate between 6 to 9 individuals daily, increasing its population by 1.2 
times. The average life cycle was 16.8 days. High viability observed in all 
instars and the resulting values of R0, rm and λ suggest that A. forbesi has the 
capacity to increase their numbers in a short period of time, while generating 
high populations in strawberry crops, requiring differential management.

Life expectancy has increased in most developed countries, which has led to an 
increase in the proportion of elderly people in the world's population. However, 
this increase in life expectancy is not accompanied by a lengthening of the 
health span since aging is characterized with progressive deterioration in 
cellular and organ functions. The brain is particularly vulnerable to disease, 
and this is reflected in the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's disease. Research shows that dysfunction of two barriers in 
the central nervous system (CNS), the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the 
blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB), plays an important role in the 
progression of these neurodegenerative diseases. The BBB is formed by the 
endothelial cells of the blood capillaries, whereas the BCSFB is formed by the 
epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (CP), both of which are affected during 
aging. Here, we give an overview of how these barriers undergo changes during 
aging and in Alzheimer's disease, thereby disturbing brain homeostasis. Studying 
these changes is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the 
mechanisms of aging at the brain barriers, which might lead to the development 
of new therapies to lengthen the health span (including mental health) and 
reduce the chances of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Successful percutaneous paravalvular leak closure followed by transfemoral 
aortic lotus valve-in-valve implantation in a degenerated surgical 
bioprosthesis.

Bioprosthesis degeneration is a relevant clinical issue that is increasingly 
developing with the higher expectancy of life. Its treatment may be further 
complicated by the presence of paravalvular leaks, which are usually consequence 
of tissue friability, annular calcification, and infection. The surgical 
treatment of such complex conditions may be too risky, so percutaneous 
techniques in selected centers are becoming an attracting option. We report the 
case of a 65-year-old gentleman with a previous aortic valve replacement 
(Perimount n.25) who was admitted with worsening heart failure and 
transoesophageal evidence of severe intraprosthetic regurgitation and a large 
paravalvular leak. Since he was judged at too high risk for surgery, he was 
treated by a fully percutaneous approach. First, he had his large paravalvular 
leak closed by implantation of two plugs from both retrograde and anterograde 
routes (arterial-venous loop created). After one month, he underwent a 
"valve-in-valve" transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a fully 
repositionable Lotus 23 mm valve, which was able to restore a completely normal 
aortic valve function and let to a dramatic improvement of his functional status 
at 6-month follow-up (from NYHA IV to NYHA I), when a transthoracic 
echocardiogram also confirmed the absence of any aortic regurgitation. This case 
shows how a tailored step-by-step fully percutaneous strategy is safe and 
feasible in high-risk patients with both bioprosthesis degeneration and large 
paravalvular leaks. This novel opportunity would need to be better evaluated in 
properly addressed long-term clinical studies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy with and without depressive symptoms in 
older adults for the years 2000 and 2010.
METHODS: We evaluated individuals aged 60 years or older (n = 1,862 in 2000 and 
n = 1,280 in 2010), participants of the Saúde, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE 
- Health, Wellbeing and Aging) study in in Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. 
Depression was measured using the shorter version of the Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS-15); respondents scoring ≥ 6 were classified as having depression. 
Estimates of life expectancy with and without depression were obtained using the 
Sullivan method.
RESULTS: Data from 2000 indicate that 60-year-old men could expect to live, on 
average, 14.7 years without depression and 60-year-old women could expect to 
live 16.5 years without depression. By 2010, life expectancy without depression 
had increased to 16.7 years for men and 17.8 years for women. Expected length of 
life with depression differed by sex, with women expected to live more years 
with depression than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2000 and 2010, life expectancy without depression in Sao 
Paulo increased. However, older adults in Brazil, especially older women, still 
face a serious burden of mental illness.

OBJETIVO: Estimar a expectativa de vida com e sem sintomas depressivos em idosos 
para os anos 2000 e 2010.
MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados (n = 1,862 in 2000 e n = 1,280 in 2010) idosos (60 anos 
ou mais), participantes do estudo Saúde, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE), 
coletado em São Paulo, Brasil. A versão mais curta da escala de depressão 
geriátrica (GDS-15) foi usada para classificar a depressão. Idosos com pontuação 
≥ 6 foram classificados como tendo depressão. As estimativas de expectativa de 
vida com e sem depressão foram obtidas usando o método de Sullivan.
RESULTADOS: Os dados de 2000 indicaram que, em média, homens e mulheres de 60 
anos de idade poderiam esperar viver, respectivamente, 14,7 e 16,5 anos sem 
depressão. Em 2010, a expectativa de vida sem depressão aumentou para 16,7 anos 
para homens e 17,8 anos para mulheres. A duração da vida com depressão diferiu 
por sexo – as mulheres idosas esperam viver mais anos com depressão do que os 
homens.
CONCLUSÕES: Entre 2000 e 2010, a expectativa de vida sem sintomas depressivos em 
São Paulo aumentou. Entretanto, os idosos no Brasil, sobretudo as mulheres, 
ainda enfrentam problemas relacionados às doenças mentais.

Interventions for Human Frailty: Physical Activity as a Model.

Fried LP(1).

In the last 100 years, populations in developed countries have experienced an 
unprecedented addition of 30 years to life expectancy. Developing countries are 
now experiencing this same phenomenon, but over a shorter time frame. With this 
success comes the challenge of maximizing health and vitality across these added 
years. The compression of morbidity to the latest point in the human life span 
could unleash a sustained third demographic dividend that benefits all of 
society. To accomplish this, society needs to invest in the prevention and 
treatment of frailty, as well as in the prevention of chronic diseases at every 
age and stage of life. A model intervention, physical activity, may offer a road 
map.

Systemic chemotherapeutic targeting of filarial parasites is unfocused due to 
their deep seated location in lymphatic vessels. This warrants a prolonged 
dosing regimen in high doses for an anthelmintic like doxycycline hydrochloride 
(DOX). In order to provide an alternative, we have constructed ultrafine PLGA 
nanoparticles of DOX (DPNPs), so as to exploit the peculiarity of lymphatic 
vasculature underneath the subcutaneous layer of skin, which preferentially 
allows entry of only 10-100 nm sized particles. DPNPs were constructed using a 
novel solvent diffusion method aided by probe sonication, which resulted in an 
average size 95.43 ± 0.8 nm as per DLS, PDI 0.168 ± 0.03, zeta potential -7.38 ± 
0.32, entrapment efficiency 75.58 ± 1.94%, and refrigerator stability of 7 days 
with respect to size in the optimized batch. TEM further substantiated the 
spherical shape of DPNPs along with their actual nonhydrated size as being well 
below 100 nm. FTIR analysis of DOX, dummy nanoparticles, and freeze-dried DPNPs 
revealed that the formulation step did not induce prominent changes in the 
chemical nature of DOX. The drug release was significantly altered (p < 0.05) 
with 64.6 ± 1.67% release in 48 h from DPNPs and was dictated by Fickian 
diffusion. Pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats further revealed that DPNPs 
caused a 16-fold prolongation in attainment of plasma Tmax and a 2-fold 
extension of elimination half-life (28.569 ± 1.27 h) at a dose of 5 mg/kg when 
compared to native drug (DOX solution) of the same strength. Contrastingly the 
trend was reversed in regional lymph nodes where Cmax for DPNPs (820 ± 84 ng/mg) 
was 4-fold greater, and lymphatic Tmax was attained in one-fourth of what was 
required for DOX solution. This size based preferential lymphatic targeting 
resulted in significantly greater in vivo antifilarial activity of DPNPs when 
compared to DOX solution as gauged by several parameters in Brugia malayi 
infected Mastomys coucha. Interestingly, the magnification in efficacy was 
obtained despite equivalent in vitro antifilarial activity of DOX solution and 
DPNPs against B. malayi worms.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of new DAA-based 
regimen use in France. A Markov model simulated chronic hepatitis C (CHC) 
treatment interventions with IFN-based and IFN-free regimens at stage of 
fibrosis ≥F3, ≥F2 or regardless of fibrosis stage, and treatment either with the 
least or the most expensive combination. It estimated quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). It also 
assessed the budget impact over 5 years of treating all CHC-screened patients, 
regardless of fibrosis, assuming ≤20 000 patients treated/year and priority to 
≥F3. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. For genotypes (G) 1-4, the 
initiation of IFN-free regardless of fibrosis was a cost-effective strategy 
compared to prior standard of care (SOC) initiated at stage F2: €40 400-88 
300/QALY gained in G1; similar results were obtained for patients infected with 
G4. Considering G2-3, the most cost-effective strategy was IFN-based regimens 
regardless of fibrosis compared to prior SOC initiated at stage F2: €21 300 and 
€19 400/QALY gained, respectively; the strategy with IFN-free regimens being 
more effective but not cost-effective at current costs. The budget impact of 
treating all CHC-screened patients over 5 years would range between 3.5 and 7.2 
billion €, depending on whether one considers the least or the most expensive 
combination of new DAAs and whether one treats G2-3 with IFN-based or IFN-free 
new DAAs. In France, treatment initiation with new DDAs regardless of fibrosis 
stage is cost-effective, but would add 3.5-7.2 billion € to an already 
overburdened medical care system.
