BACKGROUND: TransCon CNP (navepegritide) is an investigational prodrug of C-type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP) designed to allow for continuous CNP exposure with 
once-weekly dosing. This 52-week phase 2 (ACcomplisH) trial assessed the safety 
and efficacy of TransCon CNP in children with achondroplasia.
METHODS: ACcomplisH is a global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
dose-escalation trial. Study participants were recruited between June 10, 2020, 
and September 24, 2021. Eligible participants were prepubertal, aged 2-10 years, 
with genetically confirmed achondroplasia, and randomised 3:1 to once-weekly 
subcutaneous injections of TransCon CNP (6, 20, 50, or 100 μg CNP/kg/week) or 
placebo for 52 weeks. Primary objectives were safety and annualised growth 
velocity (AGV). ACcomplisH is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04085523) 
and Eudra (CT 2019-002754-22).
FINDINGS: Forty-two participants received TransCon CNP at doses of 6 μg (n = 10; 
7 female), 20 μg (n = 11; 3 female), 50 μg (n = 10; 3 female), or 100 μg 
(n = 11; 6 female) CNP/kg/week, with 15 receiving placebo (5 female). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate with no grade 
3/4 events reported. There were 2 serious TEAEs that were assessed as not 
related to TransCon CNP. Eleven injection site reactions occurred in 8 
participants receiving TransCon CNP and no symptomatic hypotension occurred. 
TransCon CNP demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in AGV. At 52 weeks, 
TransCon CNP 100 μg CNP/kg/week significantly improved AGV vs placebo (least 
squares mean [95% CI] 5.42 [4.74-6.11] vs 4.35 [3.75-4.94] cm/year; p = 0.0218), 
and improved achondroplasia-specific height SDS from baseline (least squares 
mean [95% CI] 0.22 [0.02-0·41] vs -0·08 [-0.25 to 0.10]; p = 0.0283). All 
participants completed the randomised period and continued in the ongoing 
open-label extension period receiving TransCon CNP 100 μg CNP/kg/week.
INTERPRETATION: This phase 2 trial suggests that TransCon CNP is effective, 
safe, with low injection site reaction frequency, and may provide a novel, 
once-weekly treatment option for children with achondroplasia. These results 
support TransCon CNP at 100 μg CNP/kg/week in the ongoing pivotal trial.

Thromboprophylaxis is indicated in patients at an elevated risk of developing 
thrombotic disorders, typically using direct oral anticoagulants or 
low-molecular-weight heparins. We postulated that transient thromboprophylaxis 
(days-weeks) could be provided by a single dose of an anticoagulant engineered 
for prolonged pharmacokinetics. In the present work, 
d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) was used as a 
model anticoagulant to test the hypothesis that conjugation of thrombin 
inhibitors to the surface of albumin would provide durable protection against 
thrombotic insults. Covalent conjugates were formed between albumin and PPACK 
using click chemistry, and they were tested in vitro using a thrombin activity 
assay and a clot formation assay. Thromboprophylactic efficacy was tested in 
mouse models of arterial thrombosis, both chemically induced (FeCl3) and 
following ischemia-reperfusion (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; 
tMCAO). Albumin-PPACK conjugates were shown to have nanomolar potency in both in 
vitro assays, and following intravenous injection had prolonged circulation. 
Conjugates did not impact hemostasis (tail clipping) or systemic coagulation 
parameters in normal mice. Intravenous injection of conjugates prior to 
FeCl3-induced thrombosis provided significant protection against occlusion of 
the middle cerebral and common carotid arteries, and injection immediately 
following ischemia-reperfusion reduced stroke volume measured 3 days after 
injury by ∼40% in the tMCAO model. The data presented here provide support for 
the use of albumin-linked anticoagulants as an injectable, long-circulating, 
safe thromboprophylactic agent. In particular, albumin-PPACK provides 
significant protection against thrombosis induced by multiple mechanisms, 
without adversely affecting hemostasis.

The selection of an appropriate amylase for hydrolysis poultry feed is crucial 
for achieving improved digestibility and high-quality feed. Cellulose 
nanocrystals (CNCs), which are known for their high surface area, provide an 
excellent platform for enzyme immobilization. Immobilization greatly enhances 
the operational stability of α-amylases and the efficiency of starch 
bioconversion in poultry feeds. In this study, we immobilized two 
metagenome-derived α-amylases, PersiAmy2 and PersiAmy3, on CNCs and employed 
computational methods to characterize and compare the degradation efficiencies 
of these enzymes for poultry feed hydrolysis. Experimental in vitro 
bioconversion assessments were performed to validate the computational outcomes. 
Molecular docking studies revealed the superior hydrolysis performance of 
PersiAmy3, which displayed stronger electrostatic interactions with CNCs. 
Experimental characterization demonstrated the improved performance of both 
α-amylases after immobilization at high temperatures (80 °C). A similar trend 
was observed under alkaline conditions, with α-amylase activity reaching 88% 
within a pH range of 8.0 to 9.0. Both immobilized α-amylases exhibited 
halotolerance at NaCl concentrations up to 3 M and retained over 50% of their 
initial activity after 13 use cycles. Notably, PersiAmy3 displayed more 
remarkable improvements than PersiAmy2 following immobilization, including a 
significant increase in activity from 65 to 80.73% at 80 °C, an increase in 
activity to 156.48% at a high salinity of 3 M NaCl, and a longer half-life, 
indicating greater thermal stability within the range of 60 to 80 °C. These 
findings were substantiated by the in vitro hydrolysis of poultry feed, where 
PersiAmy3 generated 53.53 g/L reducing sugars. This comprehensive comparison 
underscores the utility of computational methods as a faster and more efficient 
approach for selecting optimal enzymes for poultry feed hydrolysis, thereby 
providing valuable insights into enhancing feed digestibility and quality.

Objective: To investigate 12-month glycemic and psychosocial changes following 
transition from multiple daily injections (MDI) to advanced hybrid closed-loop 
(AHCL) therapy in youth (aged 13-25 years) with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal 
glycemia (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥8.5% [69 mmol/mol]). Research Design and 
Methods: Prospective, single arm, dual-center study in 20 participants. 
Extension phase outcomes reported after 12 months, including HbA1c, time in 
glycemic ranges, AHCL system performance, and psychosocial questionnaires 
assessing quality of life, diabetes treatment, and sleep. Results: After 12 
months, 19 out of 20 participants continued to use AHCL. Average time-in-range 
70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) improved from 27.6% ± 13.2% to 62.5% ± 11.4%. 
This translated to an average 2.5 percentage-point (27.1 mmol/mol) improvement 
in HbA1c from 10.5% ± 2.1% (91.2 mmol/mol) at baseline to 8.0% ± 0.9% 
(64.1 mmol/mol) at 12 months. Psychosocial questionnaires and very high HbA1c at 
study entry indicated significant diabetes-associated burden for both 
individuals and parents. After 12 months, improvements were observed in general 
and diabetes-specific health-related quality of life, as well as in diabetes 
treatment satisfaction. Safety data were reassuring with a diabetic ketoacidosis 
rate of 0.15 per participant-year after 12 months of AHCL (compared to 0.25 per 
participant-year in the 12 months before the study). Conclusions: After 12 
months of AHCL usage, this study highlights the potential for substantial and 
sustained glycemic and psychosocial improvements among individuals experiencing 
considerable diabetes burden and suboptimal glycemia, following their switch 
from MDI to AHCL.

PURPOSE: A study analyzing the application of a protocol of comprehensive 
geriatric assessment (CGA) in older patients with lymphoma was carried out to 
allow frailty-based patient classification and individualized treatment.
METHODS: Lymphoma patients older than 70 years referred to the Geriatric Clinic 
at a tertiary hospital between May 2016 and March 2021 were included. The 
assessment protocol included comorbidity, polypharmacy, nutritional, functional, 
and mental status, geriatric syndromes, and life expectancy. CGA enabled patient 
classification into four groups (Type I to Type IV) based on frailty assessment 
instrument scoring and clinical, functional, and mental status. Variables were 
compared using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests and Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients (55.9% women) were included. Median age was 
81.1 years (± 5.7). 23 patients (24.7%) were classified as robust (type I), 30 
(32.3%) as pre-frail (type II) with potentially reversable deficits, 38 (40.9%) 
as frail (type III), and 2 (2.2%) as requiring palliative care (type IV). 
Patients received oncospecific treatment with modifications carried out in 64.5% 
of cases based on CGA results. Differences in overall survival (p = 0.002), 
response to treatment (p < 0.001) and likelihood of increased frailty 
(p = 0.024) were observed, with type III-IV patients showing significantly worse 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Performance of standardized, systematic CGA by geriatricians permits 
older lymphoma patients to be classified according to frailty, with significant 
differences in terms of clinical outcomes across groups. We propose 
incorporating CGA performed by geriatricians as part of the multidisciplinary 
care team to optimize therapeutic strategy for these patients.

INTRODUCTION: Tonic motor activation (TOMAC) therapy is a novel 
non-pharmacologic treatment approach for patients suffering from 
medication-refractory restless legs syndrome (RLS). The objective of this study 
was to explore the potential cost-effectiveness of TOMAC in the US healthcare 
system.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to project 
strategy-specific treatment costs and benefits over 3 years and lifetime. Cohort 
characteristics (mean age 57.4 years, 39.8% male) and treatment effects were 
derived from the sham-controlled RESTFUL study. Study-observed International RLS 
Study Group (IRLS) scores were used to estimate changes in healthcare resource 
utilization and quality of life based on mapping algorithms informed by 
published data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was evaluated 
against established willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/$150,000 per QALY 
to determine cost-effectiveness. Extensive scenario analyses were performed, 
including longer-term extension study data.
RESULTS:  TOMAC and sham reduced IRLS scores from baseline 25.3 to 18.10 and 
21.60, respectively, at 4 weeks (treatment effect - 3.4 vs. sham), with an 
increase in utility from 0.80 to 0.84 (0.75-0.84 vs. baseline). Over 3 years and 
lifetime, the TOMAC vs. sham effect size corresponded to an added 0.10 and 0.49 
QALYs (2.36 vs. 2.26; 12.59 vs. 12.10) at incremental costs of $8061 and $36,373 
($36,707 vs. $28,646; $224,040 vs.$187,667), resulting in ICER estimates 
of $83,822 and $73,600, respectively. Compared to baseline, TOMAC resulted in 
ICER estimates of $29,569 and $23,690 over 3 years and lifetime, respectively. 
TOMAC remained cost-effective or dominant across all scenarios, with ICERs 
ranging from $10,530-$83,822 and - $8061 to $29,569 vs. sham and baseline, 
respectively. Larger TOMAC effect sizes, achieved per extension study data, 
further increased cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION:  Based on this exploratory analysis of published trial data, TOMAC 
therapy appears to offer meaningful improvements in patient health-related 
quality at net costs that render it a cost-effective intervention. Further 
analyses are warranted.

BACKGROUND: People with chronic neck pain (CNP) often present with impaired neck 
proprioception. The most widely used clinical test for assessing neck 
proprioception is cervical joint position sense which measures joint position 
error (JPE). This clinical test is typically performed using a laser pointer to 
examine the accuracy of returning to a neutral head position (NHP) or target 
head position (THP) following active neck movements. The aim of this study was 
to determine the measurement properties of JPE using a laser pointer when tested 
in people with and without CNP under a variety of different testing conditions 
(i.e., different movement directions, sitting versus standing, NHP versus THP).
METHODS: Forty-three participants (23 asymptomatic and 20 with CNP) underwent 
neck proprioception testing, returning to a NHP and THP in both sitting and 
standing positions (six trials for each test). A laser pointer was secured on 
the participant's forehead and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors were 
placed beneath the laser pointer and at the level of the spinous process of the 
seventh cervical vertebra. Both the absolute and the constant JPE were assessed.
FINDINGS: For the asymptomatic participants, good reliability (ICC: 0.79) was 
found only for right rotation of the THP task in sitting. In standing, good 
reliability (ICC: 0.77) was only found in flexion for the THP task. In standing, 
good reliability (ICC: 0.77) was only found for right rotation of the THP for 
the absolute JPE and left rotation (ICC: 0.85) for the constant error of the NHP 
task. In those with CNP, when tested in sitting, good reliability was found for 
flexion (ICC: 0.8) for the absolute JPE and good reliability (ICC range: 
0.8-0.84) was found for flexion, extension, and right rotation for the constant 
JPE. In standing, good reliability (ICC range: 0.81-0.88) was found for flexion, 
and rotation for the absolute JPE. The constant JPE showed good reliability 
(ICC: 0.85) for right rotation and excellent reliability (ICC: 0.93) for 
flexion. Validity was weak to strong (r range: 0.26-0.83) and moderate to very 
strong (r range: 0.47-0.93) for absolute and constant error respectively, when 
tested in sitting. In standing, the validity was weak to very strong (0.38-0.96) 
for the absolute JPE and moderate to very strong (r range: 0.54-0.92) for the 
constant JPE.
CONCLUSION: The reliability of the measure of JPE when tested in sitting and 
standing in both groups showed good reliability, but not for all movements. The 
results of the current study also showed that the laser pointer correlated well 
with the Noraxon IMUs, but not for all movements. The results of the current 
study support the use of the JPE using a laser pointer in clinical and research 
settings.

OBJECTIVES: Estimation of gradients in lifetime health, notably quality-adjusted 
life expectancy (QALE), has largely focused on index of multiple deprivation to 
categorize the population by socioeconomic position. In this article, we 
estimate QALE using alternate, individual- rather than area-level, indicators of 
socioeconomic position.
METHODS: Building on previous research methods, the distribution of QALE is 
estimated across education and income groups based on data from the Health 
Survey for England and the Office for National Statistics. QALE is estimated for 
each group by combining multivariate mortality rates and health-related quality 
of life (HRQL) weights using life tables. HRQL weights were estimated using 
ordinary least squares and missing data were handled using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: The estimated lifetime HRQL weights decreased with increased age, lower 
educational attainment, and lower income. For example, the QALE at birth for 
males in the lowest educational attainment group was 61.69 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), 1.54 QALYs lower than females in the same group. This is in 
contrast to 76.58 and 75.89 QALYs for males and females in the highest 
educational attainment group, respectively. A similar trend was observed across 
income quintiles albeit the gap was less pronounced.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of index of multiple deprivation to assess health 
inequalities may be masking important information about individual-level 
variation. Decisions makers should consider this alongside the merits of using 
area-level approaches to categorizing the population if individual-level 
approaches are preferable.

AIMS: To identify factors influencing clinicians' decisions to undertake a 
nonoperative hip fracture management approach among older people, and to 
determine whether there is global heterogeneity regarding these factors between 
clinicians from high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries 
(LMIC).
METHODS: A SurveyMonkey questionnaire was electronically distributed to 
clinicians around the world through the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN)'s 
Perioperative Special Interest Group and clinicians' personal networks between 
24 May and 25 July 2021. Analyses were performed using Excel and STATA v16.0. 
Between-group differences were determined using independent-samples t-tests and 
chi-squared tests.
RESULTS: A total of 406 respondents from 51 countries answered the 
questionnaire, of whom 225 came from HIC and 180 from LMIC. Clinicians from HIC 
reported a greater median and mean estimated proportion of admitted patients 
with hip fracture undergoing surgery (median 96% (interquartile range (IQR) 95% 
to 99%); mean 94% (SD 8%)) than those from LMIC (median 85% (IQR 75% to 95%); 
mean 81% (SD 16%); p < 0.001). Global heterogeneity seems to exist regarding 
factors such as anticipated life expectancy, insufficient resources, ability to 
pay, treatment costs, and perception of risk in hip fracture management 
decision-making.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first international sampling of clinician 
perspectives regarding nonoperative hip fracture management. Several factors 
seemed to influence the clinician decision-making process. Further research is 
needed to inform the development of best practice guidelines to improve 
decision-making and the quality of hip fracture care among older people.

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is a rare vascular complication that occurs after 
renal transplantation and usually results in irreversible kidney damage and 
graft loss. We report the case of a patient who underwent right iliac fossa 
allogeneic kidney transplantation and developed RVT combined with ipsilateral 
thrombosis from the popliteal to the femoral veins, with extension to the common 
iliac veins, 4 months after transplantation. Under unfractionated heparin 
anticoagulation, an Aegisy (Life Tech Scientific Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) 
vena cava filter was placed to prevent pulmonary embolism. Percutaneous 
mechanical thrombectomy combined with balloon angioplasty was performed to 
aspirate the thrombus and successfully dilate the narrow venous lumen. The 
patient's renal function was restored postoperatively. Ultrasonography showed 
the allograft and ipsilateral lower extremity deep veins to be fluent and 
patent. To conclude, in patients with RVT after renal transplantation, 
percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in conjunction with balloon angioplasty can 
be performed with desirable outcomes and no severe adverse effects. This method 
reduces the risk of bleeding from exposure to systemic intravenous thrombolysis 
and avoids surgery-associated trauma.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in recent decades has increased the prevalence of 
chronic diseases in the population, requiring an approach to new health topics, 
such as discussions on quality of life and expectations about death and dying. 
The concept of advance directives (ADs) gives individuals the opportunity to 
make known their decisions about the treatments they would like to receive at 
the end of life. Despite the recognition of relevance in clinical practice, the 
applicability of the concept presents challenges, including establishing the 
appropriate prognosis for each patient and the ideal time to approach the 
patient. Some prognostic tools were developed, such as the surprise question 
(SQ): "Would you be surprised if your patient died in 12 months?", which is used 
in some clinical settings to predict patient deaths and to make decisions 
regarding ADs. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the 
behavior of second-year resident physicians (PGY-2) when the SQ was applied.
METHOD: In our observational study, from July 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017, 
(PGY-2) in the Internal Medicine Residency Program (IMRP) applied SQ to all 
patients with multiple and varied chronic no communicable comorbidities, who 
were followed up at the general medicine outpatient clinic (GMOC) of a tertiary 
university hospital in São Paulo- Brazil. The frequency of the outcome (death or 
non-death within 12 months) was analyzed by correlating it with the clinical 
data (impact of the studied variables).
RESULTS: Eight hundred forty patients entered the study. Fitfty-two of them 
(6.2%) died within one year. PGY-2 predicted that two hundred and fourteen 
patients (25.5% of total) would die within a year (answer No to SQ), of which, 
32 (14.9%) did so. The correct residents' prognosis for the subgroup of 626 
patients (answer "Yes" to SQ) was NPV = 96.8% (CI = 95.4%-98.2%) and PPV = 14.9% 
(CI 10.1%-19, 6%). Answering "Yes" to SQ correlated negatively to addressing AD 
while the outcomes death and the answer No to SQ were positively correlated, 
according to the number of comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: The SQ, in addition to care, contributed to health education, 
communication and care planning shared by the doctor and patient.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of public and private health expenditure on 
health outcomes in Latin American and Caribbean countries from 2000 to 2019.
METHODS: A health production function was used, wherein life expectancy at birth 
and infant mortality rate were considered as indicators of health outcomes. 
Panel data econometrics were applied, using data from a 33-country sample for 
the period from 2000 to 2019.
RESULTS: According to estimates, a 1% increase in public health expenditure is 
associated with a 0.019% increase in life expectancy, and a 1% increase in 
private health expenditure increases life expectancy by 0.023%. At the same 
time, a 1% increase in public health expenditure reduces the infant mortality 
rate by -0.168%, whereas the effect of private health expenditure on infant 
mortality is not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence of the effect of public health 
expenditure in reducing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy, while 
private health expenditure has a positive effect only on the latter metric. The 
findings have important political implications for the countries of the Region 
in the post-pandemic context of limited fiscal space.

OBJETIVO. Determinar el efecto del gasto público y privado en salud sobre los 
resultados en salud en los países de América Latina y el Caribe durante el 
periodo 2000-2019.
MÉTODOS. Se emplea una función de producción de la salud, donde se consideró a 
la esperanza de vida al nacer y la tasa de mortalidad infantil como indicadores 
del resultado en salud. Con datos para una muestra de 33 países para el periodo 
2000-2019, se aplicó la técnica econométrica de datos panel.
RESULTADOS. Según las estimaciones, un incremento del 1% en el gasto público en 
salud está asociado a un aumento del 0,019% de la esperanza de vida. Del mismo 
modo, un incremento del 1% del gasto privado en salud aumenta en 0,023% la 
esperanza de vida. Para el caso del segundo resultado en salud, un incremento 
del 1% en el gasto público en salud reduce en -0,168% la tasa de mortalidad 
infantil. Sin embargo, el efecto del gasto privado en salud sobre la mortalidad 
infantil no es estadísticamente significativo.
CONCLUSIONES. Los resultados brindan evidencia del efecto del gasto público en 
salud para reducir la mortalidad infantil e incrementar la esperanza de vida, 
mientras que el gasto privado en salud presenta un efecto positivo solo sobre 
este último. Los hallazgos tienen importantes implicancias políticas para los 
países de la región ante un escenario postpandemia de limitado espacio fiscal.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Determinar os efeitos dos gastos públicos e privados em 
saúde sobre os resultados de saúde nos países da América Latina e do Caribe no 
período de 2000 a 2019.
MÉTODOS: Utilizamos uma função de produção da saúde, na qual a expectativa de 
vida ao nascer e a taxa de mortalidade infantil foram consideradas como 
indicadores dos resultados de saúde. Usando dados de uma amostra de 33 países no 
período de 2000 a 2019, aplicamos a técnica econométrica de dados em painel.
RESULTADOS: De acordo com as estimativas, um aumento de 1% nos gastos públicos 
em saúde está associado a um aumento de 0,019% na expectativa de vida. Da mesma 
forma, um aumento de 1% nos gastos privados em saúde resulta em um aumento de 
0,023% na expectativa de vida. No que diz respeito ao segundo indicador, um 
aumento de 1% nos gastos públicos em saúde reduz a taxa de mortalidade infantil 
em -0,168%. Por outro lado, o efeito dos gastos privados em saúde sobre a 
mortalidade infantil não é estatisticamente significativo.
CONCLUSÕES: Os resultados geram evidências sobre os efeitos dos gastos públicos 
em saúde na redução da mortalidade infantil e no aumento da expectativa de vida, 
enquanto que os gastos privados em saúde têm um efeito positivo apenas na 
expectativa de vida. Estes resultados têm implicações políticas importantes para 
os países da região, diante de um cenário pós-pandemia com espaço fiscal 
limitado.

OBJECTIVE: To present an update of the recommendations of the Brazilian College 
of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, the Brazilian Society of Mastology, and the 
Brazilian Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Associations for breast cancer 
screening in Brazil.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific evidence published between January 2012 and 
July 2022 was gathered from the following databases: Medline (PubMed); Excerpta 
Medica (Embase); Cochrane Library; Ebsco; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature (Cinahl); and Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences 
Literature (Lilacs). Recommendations were based on that evidence and were 
arrived at by consensus of a joint committee of experts from the three 
entities.Recommendations: Annual mammographic screening is recommended for women 
between 40 and 74 years of age. For women at or above the age of 75, screening 
should be reserved for those with a life expectancy greater than seven years. 
Women at higher than average risk are considered by category: those with dense 
breasts; those with a personal history of atypical lobular hyperplasia, 
classical lobular carcinoma in situ, or atypical ductal hyperplasia; those 
previously treated for breast cancer; those having undergone thoracic 
radiotherapy before age 30; and those with a relevant genetic mutation or a 
strong family history. The benefits of complementary screening are also 
addressed according to the subcategories above. The use of tomosynthesis, which 
is an evolved form of mammography, should be considered in screening, whenever 
accessible and available.

para as mulheres de risco habitual entre 40 e 74 anos. Acima de 75 anos deve ser 
reservado para as que tenham expectativa de vida maior que sete anos. Mulheres 
com risco maior que o habitual, entre elas as com mamas densas, com história 
pessoal de hiperplasia lobular atípica, carcinoma lobular in situ clássico, 
hiperplasia ductal atípica, tratamento de câncer de mama ou de irradiação no 
tórax antes dos 30 anos, ou ainda portadoras de mutação genética ou com forte 
história familiar, se beneficiam do rastreamento complementar, sendo 
consideradas de forma individualizada. A tomossíntese é uma evolução da 
mamografia e deve ser considerada no rastreamento, sempre que acessível e 
disponível.

BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome poses significant challenges in terms of risk 
stratification and management, particularly for asymptomatic patients who 
comprise the majority of individuals exhibiting Brugada ECG pattern (BrECG). The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of a large cohort of 
asymptomatic patients with BrECG.
METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with BrECG (1149) were consecutively collected 
from 2 Italian centers and followed-up at least annually for 2 to 22 years. For 
the 539 asymptomatic patients (men, 433 [80%]; mean age, 46±13 years) with 
spontaneous type 1 documented on baseline ECG (87%) or 12-lead 24-hour Holter 
monitoring (13%), an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was proposed; for the 610 
patients with drug-induced-only type 1 (men, 420 [69%]; mean age, 44±14 years), 
multiple ECGs and 12-lead Holter were advised in order to detect the occurrence 
of a spontaneous type-1 BrECG. Arrhythmic events were defined as sudden death or 
documented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6 (4-9) years. Seventeen (1.5%) arrhythmic events 
occurred in the overall asymptomatic population (corresponding to an event-rate 
of 0.2% per year), including 16 of 539 (0.4% per year) in patients with 
spontaneous type-1 BrECG and 1 of 610 in those with drug-induced type-1 BrECG 
(0.03% per year; P<0.001). EPS was performed in 339 (63%) patients with 
spontaneous type-1 BrECG. Patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG and positive 
EPS had significantly higher event rates than patients with negative EPS (7 of 
103 [0.7% per year] versus 4 of 236 [0.2% per year]; P=0.025). Among 200 
patients who declined EPS, 5 events (0.4% per year) occurred. There was 1 
device-related death.
CONCLUSIONS: The entire population of asymptomatic patients with BrECG exhibits 
a relatively low event rate per year, which is important in view of the long 
life expectancy of these young patients. The presence of spontaneous type-1 
BrECG associated with positive EPS identifies a subgroup at higher risk. 
Asymptomatic patients with drug-induced-only BrECG have a minimal arrhythmic 
risk, but ongoing follow-up with 12-lead Holter monitoring is recommended to 
detect the appearance of spontaneous type-1 BrECG pattern.

OBJECTIVE: The study of health-related care provision in archeology gives 
important indications on the culture and community organization of past 
populations. This study aims to assess the health status of the skeletal 
assemblage recovered from the burial site of St. Biagio (Ravenna, 17th-18th 
Centuries); next, we identified likely instances of need for and receipt of 
caregiving in response to the condition, to examine evidence of community 
attitudes toward disease and disability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The skeletal assemblage is composed of 133 individuals in 
a generally good state of preservation. Sex and age-at-death were estimated 
through classical anthropological methods. Health status was inferred through 
the biological index of frailty (BIF) and paleopathological analysis was 
performed through macroscopic and radiographic investigations. The 
"bioarcheology of care" approach was applied to individuals who showed evidence 
of impairment and disability.
RESULTS: The skeletal assemblage of St. Biagio was equally represented by males 
and females (50% males), with a higher percentage of adults (83.4%) than 
subadults (10.5%), and this is reflected in the high life expectancy at birth 
(40.3 years). No significant differences in health status emerged between age 
groups and sexes, with a generally high percentage of joint diseases, antemortem 
trauma, and infectious diseases. Evidence of care and compassion was found in 
some individuals with a high degree of impairment or disability, as in the case 
of probable Angelman syndrome.
DISCUSSION: This study provided important insights into the biological and 
social aspects of an Early Modern population in Northern Italy, showing that 
people with functional and/or visible abnormalities were probably cared for in 
life and were presumably considered full members of the society.
