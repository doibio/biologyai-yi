BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab is a standard care as adjuvant 
chemotherapy (AdjCT) for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-positive primary breast cancer (BC) in Japan. However, no reports have 
evaluated its economics for patients with HER2-positive BC over 70 years of age. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
HER2-targeted trastuzumab + chemotherapy in Japan, comparing it with trastuzumab 
monotherapy.
METHODS: A three-state-partitioned survival model was developed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab + chemotherapy versus trastuzumab monotherapy 
for AdjCT in elderly patients with HER2-positive BC. We derived the efficacy 
data, utilities, and costs of both arms from individual patient data in the 
RESPECT trial (NCT01104935) and published studies. The costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 2% per annum using a 
payer perspective. The respective cost estimates were reported in 2019 Japanese 
Yen (JPY) or US dollars (US$). The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We assured robustness with deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The cost per patient for trastuzumab + chemotherapy was JPY 14.6 
million (US$137,000), and their QALYs were 9.308, compared with JPY 14.2 million 
(US$131,000) and 9.101, respectively, for trastuzumab monotherapy. The ICER of 
trastuzumab + chemotherapy versus trastuzumab monotherapy was JPY 2.7 
milllion/QALY (US$17,200/QALY). The ICER for trastuzumab with chemotherapy 
varied from "Dominant" to "Dominated" in one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The base-case analysis suggests that AdjCT with 
trastuzumab + chemotherapy is likely to be a cost-effective choice for patients 
with HER2-positive BC aged 70 years or older. However, the sensitivity analysis 
suggested uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of 
trastuzumab + chemotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate systematic and anatomic site-specific age-standardized 
prevalence rates (ASRs) and analyze the secular trends of osteoarthritis (OA) at 
global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. ASRs 
and their estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to describe the 
secular trends of OA according to age group, sex, region, country, and 
territory, as well as the joints involved.
RESULTS: Globally, prevalent cases of OA increased by 113.25%, from 247.51 
million in 1990 to 527.81 million in 2019. ASRs were 6,173.38 per 100,000 in 
1990 and 6,348.25 per 100,000 in 2019, with an average annual increase of 0.12% 
(95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.11%, 0.14%). The ASR of OA increased for the 
knee, hip, and other joints, but decreased for the hand, with EAPCs of 0.32 (95% 
CI 0.29, 0.34), 0.28 (95% CI 0.26, 0.31), 0.18 (95% CI 0.18, 0.19), and -0.36 
(95% CI -0.38, -0.33), respectively. OA prevalence increased with age and 
revealed female preponderance, geographic diversity, and disparity with regard 
to anatomic site. OA of the knee contributed the most to the overall burden, 
while OA of the hip had the highest EAPC in most regions.
CONCLUSION: OA has remained a major public health concern worldwide over the 
past decades. The prevalence of OA has increased and diversified by geographic 
location and affected joint. Prevention and early treatment are pivotal to 
mitigating the growing burden of OA.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
posterior repair performed at the time of sacrocolpopexy (SCP).
METHODS: We used TreeAge Pro to construct a decision model comparing 
laparoscopic hysterectomy with SCP with and without concurrent posterior repair 
(SCP and SCP + PR). Using a time horizon of 1 year, we modeled prolapse 
recurrence, prolapse retreatment, and complications, including rectal injury, 
rectovaginal hematoma requiring surgical take-back, and postoperative 
dyspareunia. Costs included index surgery, surgical retreatment, and 
complications. We modeled effectiveness as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Cost-effectiveness was defined using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
and willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Sacrocolpopexy was the dominant strategy with a cost of $65,714 and an 
effectiveness of 0.84. It was cost-effective at willingness to pay threshold 
less than $100,000/QALY. The SCP + PR costs more ($75,063) with lower 
effectiveness (0.83). The effectiveness of the 2 strategies was similar, 
differing only by 0.01 QALY, which is less than the minimally important 
difference for utilities. Tornado plots showed CEA results were most influenced 
by the cost of SCP, cost of SCP + PR, and probability of dyspareunia after SCP. 
In 1-way sensitivity analyses, the model outcome would change only if the cost 
of SCP was increased by 12.8% or if the cost of SCP + PR decreased by 14.5%. For 
dyspareunia, our model would only change if the probability of dyspareunia after 
SCP alone was 75.9% (base case, 18.6%), whereas the probability of dyspareunia 
after SCP + PR was 26.8%.
CONCLUSION: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, SCP without concurrent PR was 
the dominant strategy.

DNA polymerases are widely used in PCR and play important roles in life science 
research and related fields. Development of high-performance DNA polymerases is 
of great commercial interest as the current commercial DNA polymerases could not 
fully satisfy the requirements of scientific research. In this study, we cloned 
and expressed a family B DNA polymerase (NCBI accession number TEU_RS04875) from 
Thermococcus eurythermalis A501, characterized its enzymatic property and 
evaluated its application in PCR. The recombinant Teu-PolB was expressed in E. 
coli and purified with affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. 
The enzymatic properties of Teu-PolB were characterized using 
fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides as substrates. The application potential 
of Teu-PolB in PCR was evaluated using the phage λ genomic DNA as a template. 
Teu-PolB has DNA polymerase and 3'→5' exonuclease activities, and is highly 
thermostable with a half-life of 2 h at 98 ℃. The most suitable PCR buffer is 
consisted of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 60 mmol/L KCl, 10 
mmol/L (NH4)2SO4, 0.015% Triton X-100 and 0.01% BSA, and the optimal extension 
temperature is 68 ℃. Under the optimized conditions, a 4 kb target fragment was 
successfully amplified with an extension rate of 2 kb/min. The yield of the 
Teu-PolB amplified-DNA was lower than that of Taq DNA polymerase, but its 
extension rate and fidelity was higher than that of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases. 
The biochemical properties of Teu-PolB demonstrate that this enzyme can be used 
in PCR amplification with high thermostability, good salt tolerance, high 
extension rate and high fidelity.

Objective.Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) brain-computer 
interface offers a promising way to improve the efficiency of motor 
rehabilitation and motor skill learning. In recent years, the power of dynamic 
network analysis for MI classification has been proved. In fact, its usability 
mainly depends on the accurate estimation of brain connection. However, 
traditional dynamic network estimation strategies such as adaptive directed 
transfer function (ADTF) are designed in the L2-norm. Usually, they estimate a 
series of pseudo connections caused by outliers, which results in biased 
features and further limits its online application. Thus, how to accurately 
infer dynamic causal relationship under outlier influence is urgent.Approach.In 
this work, we proposed a novel ADTF, which solves the dynamic system in the 
L1-norm space (L1-ADTF), so as to restrict the outlier influence. To enhance its 
convergence, we designed an iteration strategy with the alternating direction 
method of multipliers, which could be used for the solution of the dynamic 
state-space model restricted in the L1-norm space. Furthermore, we compared 
L1-ADTF to traditional ADTF and its dual extension across both simulation and 
real EEG experiments.Main results.A quantitative comparison between L1-ADTF and 
other ADTFs in simulation studies demonstrates that fewer bias errors and more 
desirable dynamic state transformation patterns can be captured by the L1-ADTF. 
Application to real MI EEG datasets seriously noised by ocular artifacts also 
reveals the efficiency of the proposed L1-ADTF approach to extract the 
time-varying brain neural network patterns, even when more complex noises are 
involved.Significance.The L1-ADTF may not only be capable of tracking 
time-varying brain network state drifts robustly but may also be useful in 
solving a wide range of dynamic systems such as trajectory tracking problems and 
dynamic neural networks.

IMPORTANCE: Decision-making on management of proximal femoral fractures in frail 
patients with limited life expectancy is challenging, but surgical overtreatment 
needs to be prevented. Current literature provides limited insight into the true 
outcomes of nonoperative management and operative management in this patient 
population.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcomes of nonoperative management vs operative 
management of proximal femoral fractures in institutionalized frail older 
patients with limited life expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted 
between September 1, 2018, and April 25, 2020, with a 6-month follow-up period 
at 25 hospitals across the Netherlands. Eligible patients were aged 70 years or 
older, frail, and institutionalized and sustained a femoral neck or 
pertrochanteric fracture. The term frail implied at least 1 of the following 
characteristics was present: malnutrition (body mass index [calculated as weight 
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] <18.5) or cachexia, severe 
comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class of IV 
or V), or severe mobility issues (Functional Ambulation Category ≤2).
EXPOSURES: Shared decision-making (SDM) followed by nonoperative or operative 
fracture management.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 
Level (EQ-5D) utility score by proxies and caregivers. Secondary outcome 
measures were QUALIDEM (a dementia-specific quality-of-life instrument for 
persons with dementia in residential settings) scores, pain level (assessed by 
the Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors With Limited Ability to Communicate), 
adverse events (Clavien-Dindo classification), mortality, treatment satisfaction 
(numeric rating scale), and quality of dying (Quality of Dying and Death 
Questionnaire).
RESULTS: Of the 172 enrolled patients with proximal femoral fractures (median 
[25th and 75th percentile] age, 88 [85-92] years; 135 women [78%]), 88 opted for 
nonoperative management and 84 opted for operative management. The EQ-5D utility 
scores by proxies and caregivers in the nonoperative management group remained 
within the set 0.15 noninferiority limit of the operative management group (week 
1: 0.17 [95% CI, 0.13-0.29] vs 0.26 [95% CI, 0.11-0.23]; week 2: 0.19 [95% CI, 
0.10-0.27] vs 0.28 [95% CI, 0.22-0.35]; and week 4: 0.24 [95% CI, 0.15-0.33] vs 
0.34 [95% CI, 0.28-0.41]). Adverse events were less frequent in the nonoperative 
management group vs the operative management group (67 vs 167). The 30-day 
mortality rate was 83% (n = 73) in the nonoperative management group and 25% 
(n = 21) in the operative management group, with 26 proxies and caregivers (51%) 
in the nonoperative management group rating the quality of dying as good-almost 
perfect. Treatment satisfaction was high in both groups, with a median numeric 
rating scale score of 8.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this study indicated that nonoperative 
management of proximal femoral fractures (selected through an SDM process) was a 
viable option for frail institutionalized patients with limited life expectancy, 
suggesting that surgery should not be a foregone conclusion for this patient 
population.

Mortality rates are two to three times higher in people with epilepsy than in 
the general population. This study aimed to quantify how this increased 
mortality translates into reduced life expectancy and to identify the underlying 
causes of deaths, thereby offering suggestions for how to reduce mortality 
associated with epilepsy. In this population-based cohort study, we included all 
individuals aged 0-94 years who were living in Denmark between 2000 and 2015. 
Using the nationwide registers, we identified people diagnosed with epilepsy and 
estimated the excess of life years lost due to 13 overall and nine specific 
causes of death. Among 6 022 160 people, we identified 129 598 with epilepsy 
(52.6% males), with a mean age of epilepsy onset of 36.5 years (standard 
deviation = 26.3 years). During the 16 years of follow-up, 851 087 individuals 
died, and of these 36 923 had been diagnosed with epilepsy. The average 
reduction in life expectancy in people with epilepsy was 11.84 years in males 
(95% confidence interval: 11.66-12.00) and 10.91 years in females (95% 
confidence interval: 10.70-11.11) compared to the general population. Life 
expectancy was reduced irrespective of epilepsy aetiology (symptomatic ∼14 
years; idiopathic ∼8-10 years), and in particular in people with epilepsy and 
psychiatric comorbidity (∼13-16 years). Excess mortality was evident across all 
causes of death including cardiovascular disorders, accidents, and suicide. 
People with epilepsy experience a substantial reduction in lifespan that can 
only partly be explained by underlying conditions. Prevention of 
epilepsy-related deaths should focus on the consequences of psychiatric 
comorbidity and on modifiable risk factors associated with preventable causes of 
death such as accidents and neurological and cardiovascular disorders.

AIMS: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains an important health issue, yet 
global attention to RHD is diminishing. This study aimed to investigate the 
global burden of RHD and its relationship with socioeconomic development status.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2019 database. Incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
and mortality numbers and rates for RHD were extracted and stratified by sex, 
level of socio-demographic index (SDI), country, and territory. In addition, the 
burden of RHD was compared across age groups. From 1990 to 2019, the 
age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates of RHD increased by 14.4% 
(11.2-17.0%) and 13.8% (11.0-16.0%), respectively. Incidence and prevalence 
rates showed an increasing trend in low SDI and low-middle SDI locations, while 
high-middle SDI and high SDI locations showed a decreasing trend. The 
age-standardized DALYs and mortality rates of RHD decreased by 53.1% (46.4-60.0) 
and 56.9% (49.8-64.7%), and this downward trend was more prominent in 
high-middle SDI and middle SDI locations. In addition, the age of incidence and 
prevalence rates were concentrated between 5-24 years and 15-49 years, 
predominantly in poor regions, and RHD appeared to be more common in women than 
in men.
CONCLUSION: The burden of RHD is negatively correlated with socioeconomic 
development status. In particular, the burden of RHD among children, 
adolescents, and women of childbearing age in poorer regions requires more 
attention. Policymakers should use the 2019 GBD data to guide cost-effective 
interventions and resource allocation for RHD.

BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer disease is one of the most common diseases in 
gastroenterology clinics. However, reported data about the global burden of 
peptic ulcer disease are still scarce.
METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis on the prevalence, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to peptic ulcer disease by sex, age 
group and socio-demographic index (SDI) at the global level in 21 regions and 
204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019 using the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, the prevalence cases of peptic ulcer disease increased from 
6 434 103 (95% uncertainty interval 5 405 963 to 7 627 971) in 1990 to 8 090 476 
(6 794 576 to 9 584 000) in 2019. However, the age-standardized prevalence rate 
decreased from 143.4 (120.5 to 170.2) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 99.4 
(83.9 to 117.5) per 100 000 population in 2019. Moreover, the age-standardized 
mortality rate decreased by 59.4% (55.3 to 63.1) and the DALYs rate fell by 
60.6% (56.8 to 63.9) from 1990 to 2019. Across SDI quintiles, low-middle and low 
SDI quintiles had the highest age-standardized prevalence, mortality and DALYs 
rates from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSION: The age-standardized prevalence, mortality and DALYs estimates of 
peptic ulcer disease decreased from 1990 to 2019 globally, but more efforts are 
needed for the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease 
in low SDI and low-middle SDI groups of countries.

BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians represent only a small proportion of patients included 
in large transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) trials, but will become a 
relevant future population in need of treatment due to demographic change. Thus, 
this study sought to evaluate outcomes of TAVR for the treatment of severe 
aortic stenosis (AS) in nonagenarian patients.
METHODS: We screened Medline/Pubmed for studies that stated specific outcomes 
for nonagenarians undergoing TAVR. A weighted meta-analysis was conducted, 
calculating pooled estimate rates using a binary random-effects model for 
dichotomous variables, and comparing non-dichotomous outcomes with a continuous 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Data from 23 studies including 16,094 nonagenarians were merged; 53.4% 
were women. Despite reasonable rates of comorbidities, Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons mortality risk score was 10.2 ± 5.4. Pooled estimate rate of procedural 
success was 94.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.7-96.6), with major vascular 
complications occurring in 6.3% (95% CI, 2.7-9.8) and at least moderate 
postprocedural paravalvular leak in 7.5% (95% CI, 4.4-10.6). The rate of 
periprocedural stroke or transient ischemic attack was 2.6% (95% CI, 2.0-3.2). 
At 30 days, the pooled estimate of mortality was 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7-7.4) and a 
permanent pacemaker was implanted in 12.6% (95% CI, 7.6-17.6). After 1 year, the 
mortality rate was 20.5% (95% CI, 15.9-25.1).
CONCLUSION: TAVR in nonagenarians is an effective and safe procedure, with 
encouraging outcomes given the general life expectancy of these patients. 
Currently, only selected nonagenarians are undergoing TAVR, but their number 
will grow as life expectancy continues to increase in the developed world. 
Specific research to identify ideal candidates and techniques in this cohort is 
needed.

BACKGROUND: The discovery of trastuzumab as anti-HER2 therapy has markedly 
improved disease control and the survival rates of patients with HER2+ breast 
cancer. However, as trastuzumab is considered a complex molecule, the cost of 
production is usually elevated, which significantly affects health budgets and 
limits the treatment access for patients who live in underdeveloped countries. 
Recently, trastuzumab production has become more accessible and sustainable due 
to the patents' expiration, allowing biosimilar versions of trastuzumab to be 
developed.
OBJECTIVE: Our main goal was to shed more light on the uses of biosimilars in 
breast cancer treatment, emphasizing trastuzumab.
METHOD: An integrative search was carried out on the PubMed, Scielo, Web of 
Science, and SCOPUS databases using the terms "biosimilar," "breast cancer," 
"monoclonal antibody," and "trastuzumab." The time range included scientific 
articles published from 2015 to 2021.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The bibliographic survey showed the complexities in 
biological medicine manufacturing and how the monoclonal antibody's therapy with 
trastuzumab improved the patients' life expectancy, revolutionizing HER2+ breast 
cancer treatment. Nonetheless, despite its benefits, trastuzumab generates 
certain restrictions, especially from the economic perspective. Trastuzumab 
biosimilars have high selectivity and rarely cause adverse effects compared to 
conventional chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that trastuzumab biosimilars improve patients' 
accessibility to breast cancer treatment through a safe and effective therapy 
compared to the drug reference.

BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common problem among advanced cancer patients; 
however, many of them find limited effective from current therapies. Thus, we 
aimed to test the effect of a traditional Chinese herbal formula, modified 
MaZiRenWan (MZRW), by comparing with placebo among palliative cancer patients 
with constipation.
METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 
Participants aged over 18 were recruited and randomized to MZRW or placebo group 
in addition to current prescriptions (including ongoing laxatives treatment) for 
two weeks. Exclusion criteria included cognitive impairment, presence of a 
colostomy or gastrointestinal obstruction and estimated life expectancy of less 
than one month. Individualized modification of MZRW was allowed according to the 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern of patient. The primary outcome was 
the global assessment of improvement, which reflected whether the constipation 
had improved, remained the same or worsened.
RESULTS: Sixty patients, with mean age 75.2 years (range 47-95 years), were 
randomized to MZRW or placebo group. Among the MZRW group, 59.3% (16/27) had 
improvement in the global assessment score, as compared with 28.6% (8/28) of the 
placebo group (p-value = 0.022). Besides, the MZRW group had significant 
increase in stool frequency, and reduction in constipation severity and 
straining of defecation (p-value < 0.05). No serious adverse event was reported 
due to the research medication.
CONCLUSION: This pilot trial suggests modified MZRW is well-tolerated and 
effective for relief of constipation in patients with advance cancer. It could 
be considered as a potential treatment option for constipation in palliative 
care.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial had been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with 
identifier number NCT02795390 [ https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02795390 
] on June 10, 2016.

BACKGROUND: While the fast extension of combination antiretroviral therapy 
(cART) has resulted in significant increases in life expectancy, disorders such 
as cardiometabolic syndrome (CMetS), which have received less attention, are 
becoming a major concern in HIV/AIDS patients (PLWHA).
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to identify biomarkers and 
determine the prevalence of CMetS in PLWHA using the National Cholesterol 
Education Program (NCEP) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) tools.
METHODS: Between January 2019 and February 2021, a hospital-based study of 
HIV-infected patients (n = 288) was conducted. The data were analyzed using 
binary logistic regression. To control the effect of confounders, independent 
variables with a P-value of <.20 in the bivariate logistic regression were 
incorporated into multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was 
defined as a 95% confidence interval and a P-value of less than .05.
RESULTS: The risk of CMetS increased twofold as age increased each year 
(P = .009), 1.2 times as the age at which cART began increased (P = .015), and 6 
times with 1 or more co-morbidities (P = .028), according to the NCEP tool. 
Furthermore, significant NCEP-CMetS correlations were produced by a rise in 
diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) and cART duration (P = .006). Male gender 
was 99.9% less likely to be related to CMetS using the IDF tool, and the risk of 
CMetS increased fourfold with each unit increase in waist circumference 
(P < .001). Triglycerides and blood type "A" have been found to have substantial 
relationships with CMetS using both techniques.
CONCLUSION: According to the study, CMetS was found to be common in PLWHA. Age, 
time on cART, age when cART started, gender, co-morbidities, waist 
circumference, and diastolic blood pressure were all revealed to be significant 
predictors of CMetS. Triglycerides and blood type "A" were the only biomarkers 
found to be significant with CMetS using both the NCEP and IDF tools.

Fetal akinesia associated with fixed joints is a common cause for suspicion of 
arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a severe condition with heterogeneous 
etiology. We present the case of a rarer but more benign condition, congenital 
knee dislocation. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old woman medicated 
with levetiracetam for epilepsy whose prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks 
of gestational age revealed bilateral clubfoot, permanent extension of the 
inferior limbs with internal knee rotation, normal amniotic fluid quantity, and 
fetal echocardiography. The remaining ultrasounds revealed similar results. 
Prenatal genetic testing revealed no pathological findings. The pregnancy was 
otherwise uneventful. A female newborn was delivered at 39 weeks by cesarean 
section, with no need for resuscitation. She presented with bilateral 
knee hyperextension and clubfoot, spontaneous movements, and normal mobility in 
all other joints. The remaining physical examination and brain and hip 
ultrasound on the second day of life were normal. These findings were compatible 
with idiopathic congenital dislocation of the knee (CDK). The patient was 
undergoing treatment with favorable evolution and adequate neurodevelopment, at 
the time of this report.  This case describes a diagnostic workup with the 
exclusion of severe syndromic pathologies, namely arthrogryposis. Despite the 
initial suspicion of arthrogryposis, a condition with a poor prognosis, this 
infant presented a more benign disease with favorable evolution.

OBJECTIVES: The proportion of elderly patients with esophageal cancer (EC) is 
increasing due to prolonged life expectancy and aging process. The aim of the 
study is to explore the optimal treatment strategy for elderly patients (aged 
≥70 years) with locally advanced EC.
METHODS: Eligible patients with cT2-4aNxM0 EC were identified in the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2010 to 2016. 
Treatment patterns were divided into six groups: surgical resection (S), 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT), trimodality therapy (CRT+S), radiotherapy (RT), 
chemotherapy (CT), or observation with no treatment (Obs). Survival between 
groups was compared using the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards 
model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: A total of 2917 patients with potentially curable EC were identified. 
Of all the patients included, 6.7%, 51.8%, 18.0%, 9.4% and 3.6%received S, CRT, 
CRT+S, RT, and CT, respectively, whereas 10.6% underwent Obs. The 3-year OS 
estimates were 30.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.5-38.9%), 25.4% (95% CI: 
22.8-28.3%),44.3% (95% CI: 39.3-49.9%), 11.4% (95% CI: 7.7-17.0%), 16.1% (95% 
CI: 9.1-28.3%), and 5.6% (95% CI: 3.2-9.8%) for S, CRT, CRT+S RT, CT, and Obs 
(p<0.001), respectively. Overall, patents underwent CRT+S had the longest OS, 
compared to other treatment patterns, and the survival difference was not 
significant between patients receiving CRT and S (p=0.12) in the elderly 
population. However, the survival benefits of trimodality therapy over CRT 
gradually weakened with the increase in age, and became statistically 
non-significant for EC patients aged ≥80 years (p=0.35). Multivariate analysis 
showed that treatment patterns, age, sex, tumor grade, T stage, N stage, and 
marital status were significantly associated with OS.
CONCLUSION: Generally, the use of trimodality therapy was associated with the 
longest OS, the survival benefits were comparable between CRT and S alone, and 
CRT was superior to RT or CT alone in elderly patients with curable EC. For 
patients intolerable to surgery or aged ≥80 years, definitive CRT should be 
considered as a preferable option.

The progress of the health sector in a sustainable manner is crucial for the 
development of human capital, a significant and vital driver of economic growth. 
Hence, we aim to investigate the impact of FinTech on health outcomes in Asian 
economies over the period 2007-2019. The empirical estimation of the study is 
based on the 2SLS and GMM techniques. The outcomes confirmed the negative impact 
of ATMs and Debit cards on the infant mortality rate in both 2SLS and GMM 
models. Whereas, ATMs and Debit cards positively impact the life expectancy of 
people living in Asian economies irrespective of the estimation technique. 
Similarly, the association between the Internet and infant mortality rate is 
negative; whereas, this association is positive in the context of the Internet 
and life expectancy both with 2SLS and GMM. From these findings, we can confirm 
that the amalgamation of technology and the financial sector helps to improve 
health outcomes in Asian economies. Therefore, the integration of FinTech into 
the health sector should be part and parcel of every health policy in emerging 
Asian economies.

Population health is a key pillar of the fast-growing economies, but several 
challenges threaten it. This study scrutinizes the impact of real estate prices 
(housing rent) and inflation on population health by using advanced economies 
from 1996 to 2019. Health is measured by infant mortality rates and life 
expectancy at birth. The empirical outcomes show a positive and significant 
effect of housing rent on the infant mortality rate. In contrast, housing rent 
improves life expectancy. We also find that an increase in inflation positively 
affects the infant mortality rate and has a negative effect on life expectancy. 
GDP and health expenditure tend to improve health by increasing life expectancy 
and reducing the infant mortality rate. However, unemployment is harmful effects 
on population health. This study recommends that healthcare practitioners 
consider the housing market and inflationary pressure.

Citrus bacterial canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc), is a 
major disease of citrus plants, causing a significant loss in the citrus 
industry. The pthA is a bacterial effector protein mediates protein-protein and 
protein-DNA interactions and modulates host transcription. Injection of pthA 
effector protein into the host cell induces the expression of the susceptibility 
gene CsLOB1 which is required for citrus canker disease development. In this 
study, we described in planta expression of a specific anti-pthA single-chain 
variable fragment (scFv) recombinant antibody, scFvG8, and assessed its function 
using molecular docking, immunoblotting, and indirect enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the results, homology-based molecular 
docking suggested that at least eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds are involved 
in pthA-scFvG8 interactions. Immunoblotting and indirect ELISA results 
reconfirmed specific binding of scFvG8 to pthA protein. Moreover, gene fragment 
encoding scFvG8 was cloned into plant expression vector and transiently 
expressed in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samson by agroinfiltration method. 
Transient expression of scFvG8 (at the expected size of 35 kDa) in N. tabacum 
leaves was confirmed by western blotting. Also, immunoblotting and indirect 
ELISA showed that the plant-derived scFvG8 had similar activity to purified 
scFvG8 antibody in detecting pthA. Additionally, in scFvG8-expressing tobacco 
leaves challenged with Xcc, a reduction (for up to 70%) of hypersensitive 
response (HR) possibly via direct interaction with pthA, was observed in the 
necrotic leaf area compared to control plants infected with empty vector. The 
results obtained in this study confirm that scFvG8 can suppress the function of 
pthA effector protein within plant cells, thus the induction of stable 
expression of scFvG8 in lime trees can be considered as an appropriate approach 
to confer resistance to Xcc.
