The prognosis for infants born with complex heart disease improved dramatically 
with the introduction of the Fontan circulation 50 years ago. With today's 
carefully designed and staged operations to a Fontan circulation, life 
expectancy has increased and most children will survive into adult life. The 
Fontan circulation entails an unphysiological circulation with high risk for 
multiple organ system dysfunction. Neurodevelopmental disabilities with adverse 
psychosocial effects are prevalent. The Fontan circulation may eventually fail 
and necessitate heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: Fifty years development of 
the Fontan circulation to today's staged surgical procedures has improved 
survival but also revealed the burden of a high morbidity for a growing number 
of patients.

The number of elderly multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is growing, mainly due to 
the increase in the life expectancy of the general population and the 
availability of effective disease-modifying treatments. However, current 
treatments reduce the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the 
disease, but they cannot stop the disability accumulation associated with 
disease progression. One possible explanation is the impact of immunosenescence, 
which is associated with the accumulation of unusual immune cell subsets that 
are thought to have a role in the development of an early ageing process in 
autoimmunity. Here, we provide a recent overview of how senescence affects 
immune cell function and how it is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
diseases, particularly MS. Numerous studies have demonstrated age-related immune 
changes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, and the premature 
onset of immunosenescence has been demonstrated in MS patients. Therefore, 
potential therapeutic strategies based on rejuvenating the immune system have 
been proposed. Senolytics and regenerative strategies using haematopoietic stem 
cells, therapies based on rejuvenating oligodendrocyte precursor cells, 
microglia and monocytes, thymus cells and senescent B and T cells are capable of 
reversing the process of immunosenescence and could have a beneficial impact on 
the progression of MS.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The recent report on Value-of-Treatment (VoT) project 
highlights the need for early diagnosis-intervention, integrated, seamless care 
underpinning timely care pathways and access to best treatments. The 
VoT-multiple-sclerosis (MS) economic case study analysis aimed to estimate the 
effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of both early treatment and reducing MS risk 
factors (e.g. smoking and vitamin D insufficiency).
METHODS: A series of decision analytical modellings were developed and applied 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of: (1) reducing the conversion from 
clinically-isolated-syndrome (CIS) to clinically-definite-MS (CDMS); (2) smoking 
cessation and increase of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum level. Both (1) 
and (2) considered socioeconomic impact on averted MS disability progression. 
Costs were reported for societal and healthcare provider perspectives (pending 
on data across nations; Euros). Effectiveness was expressed as 
Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs) gains. Long term (25, 30, 40,50-years) and 
short (one-year) timelines were considered for (1) and (2), respectively.
RESULTS: Early treatment was cost-effective for the health care provider and 
both cost-effective/cost-saving for the society across time-horizons and 
nations. Smoking cessation and an increase of 25(OH)D in MS patients were both 
cost-effective/cost-saving across nations.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first economic 
evidence to base appropriate public health interventions to reduce the MS burden 
in Europe.

in medieval England.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the major health problems of the Middle Ages. Bubonic 
plague is often considered the greatest health disaster in medieval history, but 
this has never been systematically investigated.
MATERIALS: We triangulate upon the problem using (i) modern WHO data on disease 
in the modern developing world, (ii) historical evidence for England such as 
post-medieval Bills of Mortality, and (iii) prevalences derived from original 
and published palaeopathological studies.
METHODS: Systematic analysis of the consequences of these health conditions 
using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) according to the Global Burden of 
Disease methodology.
RESULTS: Infant and child death due to varied causes had the greatest impact 
upon population and health, followed by a range of chronic/infectious diseases, 
with tuberculosis probably being the next most significant one.
CONCLUSIONS: Among medieval health problems, we estimate that plague was 
probably 7th-10th in overall importance. Although lethal and disruptive, it 
struck only periodically and had less cumulative long-term human consequences 
than chronically endemic conditions (e.g. bacterial and viral infections causing 
infant and child death, tuberculosis, and other pathogens).
SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to modern health regimes, medieval health was above 
all an ecological struggle against a diverse host of infectious pathogens; 
social inequality was probably also an important contributing factor.
LIMITATIONS: Methodological assumptions and use of proxy data mean that only 
approximate modelling of prevalences is possible.
SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Progress in understanding medieval health 
really depends upon understanding ancient infectious disease through further 
development of biomolecular methods.

Background Recent trials comparing catheter ablation to medical therapy in 
patients with heart failure (HF) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite 
first-line management have demonstrated a reduction in adverse outcomes. We 
performed an economic evaluation to estimate the cost-utility of catheter 
ablation as second line therapy in patients with HF with reduced ejection 
fraction. Methods and Results A Markov model with health states of alive, dead, 
and alive with amiodarone toxicity was constructed, using the perspective of the 
Canadian healthcare payer. Patients in the alive states were at risk of HF and 
non-HF hospitalizations. Parameters were obtained from randomized trials and 
Alberta health system data for costs and outcomes. A lifetime time horizon was 
adopted, with discounting at 3.0% annually. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed. Costs are reported in 2018 Canadian dollars. A patient 
treated with catheter ablation experienced lifetime costs of $64 960 and 5.63 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), compared with $49 865 and 5.18 QALYs for 
medical treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $35 360/QALY 
(95% CI, $21 518-77 419), with a 90% chance of being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY. A minimum mortality reduction of 
28%, or a minimum duration of benefit of >1 to 2 years was required for catheter 
ablation to be attractive at this threshold. Conclusions Catheter ablation is 
likely to be cost-effective as a second line intervention for patients with HF 
with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
$35 360/QALY, as long as over half of the relative mortality benefit observed in 
extant trials is borne out in future studies.

Introduction and Objective: As life expectancy continues to rise, the prevalence 
of frailty is also increasing. The idea of frailty and its effect on the 
operative patient has been previously studied, but not regularly incorporated 
into routine practice. We present a review on frailty metrics in the literature, 
validated assessment methods, and simplified screening tools to better predict 
and optimize patient outcomes. Methods: An online PubMed search was conducted by 
three authors (T.A., T.G.R.B., M.M.) for overall frailty, frailty assessment, 
and preoperative risk assessment. Only English publications were included in the 
analysis. Full-text analysis was then conducted by all three authors to validate 
the data. Results: An abundance of literature was found on frailty. Even though 
some methods are validated as extremely effective for assessing frailty, they 
may be time-consuming and require a specialist. Various quick screening methods 
are also presented, many already validated, and should be utilized by urologists 
more regularly. Conclusions: Multiple studies demonstrate the relationship 
between frailty and surgical patients' outcome. Many quick, office-based, 
validated tools to screen for frailty are described, and should be incorporated 
into our practice in appropriate patients. Future research is now focused on the 
concept of "prehabilitation" to improve patient frailty status in the 
preoperative setting, and consequently operative outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to the comparison of COVID-19 
pandemic responses and related factors in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, 
and South Africa) countries. We aimed at evaluating the association of daily new 
COVID-19 cases with socio-economic and demographic factors, health 
vulnerability, resources, and policy response in BRICS countries.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data on the COVID-19 
pandemic and other indicators of BRICS countries from February 26, 2020 to April 
30, 2021. We compared COVID-19 epidemic in BRICS countries and analyzed related 
factors by log-linear Generalized Additive Model (GAM) models.
RESULTS: In BRICS countries, India had the highest totally of confirmed cases 
with 18.76 million, followed by Brazil (14.45 million), Russia (4.81 million), 
and South Africa (1.58 million), while China (0.10 million) had the lowest 
figure. South Africa had the lowest rate of administered vaccine doses (0.18 
million) among BRICS countries as of April 30, 2021. In the GAM model, a 1 unit 
increase in population density and policy stringency index was associated with a 
5.17% and 1.95% growth in daily new COVID-19 cases (P < 0.001), respectively. 
Exposure-response curves for the effects of policy stringency index on daily new 
cases showed that there was a rapid surge in number of daily new COVID-19 cases 
when the index ranged from 0 to 45. The number of infections climbed slowly when 
the index ranged from 46 to 80, and decreased when the index was above 80 
(P < 0.001). In addition, daily new COVID-19 cases (all P < 0.001) were also 
correlated with life expectancy at birth (-1.61%), extreme poverty (8.95%), 
human development index (-0.05%), GDP per capita (-0.18%), diabetes prevalence 
(0.66%), proportion of population aged 60 and above (2.23%), hospital beds per 
thousand people (-0.08%), proportion of people with access to improved drinking 
water (-7.40%), prevalence of open defecation (0.69%), and annual 
tourist/visitor arrivals (0.003%), after controlling other confounders. 
Different lag structures showed similar results in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Strong policy response is crucial to control the pandemic, such as 
effective containment and case management. Our findings also highlighted the 
importance of reducing socio-economic inequalities and strengthening the 
resilience of health systems to better respond to public health emergencies 
globally.

Neuroendocrine manifestations of Erdheim-Chester disease.

University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Neuroendocrine manifestations are common in Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) 
patients. ECD is a rare non-Langerhans form of histiocytosis with multisystemic 
infiltration. The involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis is common and 
central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is one of the most common endocrine 
manifestations in ECD patients. CDI is the first manifestation of ECD in 25%-48% 
of the cases. Suprasellar region extension, due to the infiltration of ECD 
lesions, can cause neurologic manifestations by mass effects, such as headache, 
visual disturbance, and cranial nerve palsies. Recent studies have revealed that 
disorders affecting anterior pituitary hormones are common in ECD patients. 
Secondary adrenal insufficiency, secondary hypothyroidism, (adult) growth 
hormone deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, and 
hypoprolactinemia can develop as the neuroendocrine manifestations of ECD. Since 
the symptoms of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies tend to be nonspecific, 
the diagnosis of anterior pituitary hormone dysfunctions can be delayed. Some 
anterior pituitary dysfunctions such as adrenocorticotropic hormone and/or 
thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiencies can be life-threatening without 
adequate hormone supplementation therapies. An endocrinological evaluation of 
the function of the pituitary gland should be performed at the initial diagnosis 
of ECD. It is important to recognize that endocrine dysfunctions can develop 
later during the follow-up of ECD.

Comment in
    Surgery. 2022 Jan;171(1):102-103.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend screening for primary aldosteronism in patients 
diagnosed with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Recent studies have 
shown that adherence to these recommendations is extremely low. It has been 
suggested that cost is a barrier to implementation. No analysis has been done to 
rigorously evaluate the cost-effectiveness of widespread implementation of these 
guidelines.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model to evaluate screening of the 
hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea population for primary aldosteronism as per 
guideline recommendations in comparison with current rates of screening. 
Probabilities, utility values, and costs were identified in the literature. 
Threshold and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness of the model. Costs were 
represented in 2020 US dollars and health outcomes in quality-adjusted 
life-years. The model assumed a societal perspective with a lifetime time 
horizon.
RESULTS: Screening per guideline recommendations had an expected cost of $47,016 
and 35.27 quality-adjusted life-years. Continuing at current rates of screening 
had an expected cost of $48,350 and 34.86 quality-adjusted life-years. Screening 
was dominant, as it was both less costly and more effective. These results were 
robust to sensitivity analysis of disease prevalence, test sensitivity, patient 
age, and expected outcome of medical or surgical treatment of primary 
aldosteronism. The screening strategy remained cost-effective even if screening 
were conservatively presumed to identify only 3% of new primary aldosteronism 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, 
rigorous screening for primary aldosteronism is cost-saving due to 
cardiovascular risk averted. Cost should not be a barrier to improving primary 
aldosteronism screening adherence.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic liver resection is increasing operate. In the early 
stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), many studies supported that 
laparoscopic liver resection was a safe procedure and showed some clinical 
benefits. However, the full economic evaluation has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: A hybrid model of decision tree and Markov state transition model was 
constructed. Health outcomes were life-year gained (LYs), and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed and a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted by 1,000 micro-simulation. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was reported and the willingness to 
pay (WTP) was defined at 160,000 THB per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Laparoscopic liver resection in the early stage of HCC was not 
cost-effective. In the base-case analysis, the total lifetime cost of 
laparoscopic approach was an average of 413,377 THB (US$13,214) higher than open 
approach by 55,474 THB (US$1,773) with a small QALY gained. The resulting ICER 
was 1,356,521 THB (US$43,362) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic liver resection is not considered as a cost-effective 
alternative to open liver surgery in the early stage of HCC. In the Thai 
healthcare perspective, the results from this study may inform policymakers for 
the future policy implementation and healthcare resource allocation.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize and describe the current US surveillance systems that 
assess physical activity (PA) for work and commuting.
METHODS: An expert group conducted an environmental scan, generating a list 
(n = 18) which was ultimately reduced to 12, based on the inclusion of PA and/or 
sedentary behavior data.
RESULTS: The 12 surveys or surveillance systems summarized provide nationally 
representative data on occupational-level PA or individual-level PA at work, 
data on active commuting, some are scorecards that summarize workplace health 
best practices and allow benchmarking, and one is a comprehensive nationally 
representative survey of employers assessing programs and practices in different 
worksites.
CONCLUSIONS: The various surveillance systems and surveys/scorecards are 
disparate and need to be better analyzed and summarized to understand the impact 
of occupational-level PA and commuting on population health and well-being, life 
expectancy, and workforce productivity.

Structural discrimination worsens physical health inequities and significantly 
reduces life expectancy for people with mental health and addiction issues. 
Aotearoa has recently made some notable changes in health policy by formally 
recognising the physical health needs of people with mental health and addiction 
issues. The COVID-19 vaccination sequencing framework provides an important 
opportunity to protect and promote the health of people with addiction and 
mental health issues. An expert advisory group, convened as part of the Aotearoa 
Equally Well collaborative, considered findings of a literature review on the 
vulnerability of people with mental health and addiction issues of contracting 
and dying from COVID-19. Evidence indicates an association between mental health 
and addiction issues and infection risk and worse outcomes. The group concluded 
mental health and addiction issues should be recognised as underlying health 
conditions that increase COVID-19 vulnerability, and that people with these 
issues should be prioritised for vaccination. For too long the health system has 
failed to address the life expectancy gap of people with addiction and mental 
health issues. Now is an opportunity to change the kōrero. People with mental 
health and addiction issues experience significant physical health inequities. 
Addressing these inequities must be integral in modern health policy-including 
our COVID-19 pandemic response.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroregeneration is a major challenge in neuroscience for 
treating degenerative diseases and for repairing injured nerves. Numerous 
studies have shown the importance of physical stimulation for neuronal growth 
and development, and here we report an approach for the physical guidance of 
neuron orientation and neurite growth using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) 
nanoparticles and magnetic fields (MFs).
METHODS: SPIO nanoparticles were synthesized by classic chemical 
co-precipitation methods and then characterized by transmission electron 
microscope, dynamic light scattering, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The 
cytotoxicity of the prepared SPIO nanoparticles and MF was determined using 
CCK-8 assay and LIVE/DEAD assay. The immunofluorescence images were captured by 
a laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cell migration was evaluated using the 
wound healing assay.
RESULTS: The prepared SPIO nanoparticles showed a narrow size distribution, low 
cytotoxicity, and superparamagnetism. SPIO nanoparticles coated with 
poly-L-lysine could be internalized by spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and showed 
no cytotoxicity at concentrations less than 300 µg/mL. The neurite extension of 
SGNs was promoted after internalizing SPIO nanoparticles with or without an 
external MF, and this might be due to the promotion of growth cone development. 
It was also confirmed that SPIO can regulate cell migration and can direct 
neurite outgrowth in SGNs preferentially along the direction imposed by an 
external MF.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the regulation of 
cell behaviors under physical cues and suggest alternative treatments for 
sensorineural hearing loss caused by the degeneration of SGNs.

Finger flexor spasticity, which is commonly observed among patients with stroke, 
disrupts finger extension movement, consequently influencing not only upper limb 
function in daily life but also the outcomes of upper limb therapeutic exercise. 
Kinesthetic illusion induced by visual stimulation (KINVIS) has been proposed as 
a potential treatment for spasticity in patients with stroke. However, it 
remains unclear whether KINVIS intervention alone could improve finger flexor 
spasticity and finger extension movements without other intervention modalities. 
Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of a single KINVIS session 
on finger flexor spasticity, including its underlying neurophysiological 
mechanisms, and finger extension movements. To this end, 14 patients who 
experienced their first episode of stroke participated in this study. A computer 
screen placed over the patient's forearm displayed a pre-recorded mirror image 
video of the patient's non-paretic hand performing flexion-extension movements 
during KINVIS. The position and size of the artificial hand were adjusted 
appropriately to create a perception that the artificial hand was the patient's 
own. Before and after the 20-min intervention, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) 
scores and active range of finger extension movements of the paretic hand were 
determined. Accordingly, MAS scores and active metacarpophalangeal joint 
extension range of motion improved significantly after the intervention. 
Moreover, additional experimentation was performed using F-waves on eight 
patients whose spasticity was reduced by KINVIS to determine whether the same 
intervention also decreased spinal excitability. Our results showed no change in 
F-wave amplitude and persistence after the intervention. These results 
demonstrate the potential clinical significance of KINVIS as a novel 
intervention for improving finger flexor spasticity and extension movements, one 
of the most significant impairments among patients with stroke. The decrease in 
finger flexor spasticity following KINVIS may be attributed to 
neurophysiological changes not detectable by the F-wave, such as changes in 
presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. Further studies are certainly needed to 
determine the long-term effects of KINVIS on finger spasticity, as well as the 
neurophysiological mechanisms explaining the reduction in spasticity.

Role of Brain Arterial Remodeling in HIV-Associated Cerebrovascular Outcomes.

NY, United States.

As the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) on combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) increases, so does morbidity from cerebrovascular 
disease and neurocognitive disorders. Brain arterial remodeling stands out as a 
novel investigational target to understand the role of HIV in cerebrovascular 
and neurocognitive outcomes. We therefore conducted a review of publications in 
PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library, from inception to April 
2021. We included search terms such as HIV, cART, brain, neuroimmunity, arterial 
remodeling, cerebrovascular disease, and neurocognitive disorders. The 
literature shows that, in the post-cART era, PLWH continue to experience an 
increased risk of stroke and neurocognitive disorders (albeit milder forms) 
compared to uninfected populations. PLWH who are immunosuppressed have a higher 
proportion of hemorrhagic strokes and strokes caused by opportunistic infection 
and HIV vasculopathy, while PLWH on long-term cART have higher rates of ischemic 
strokes, compared to HIV-seronegative controls. Brain large artery 
atherosclerosis in PLWH is associated with lower CD4 nadir and higher CD4 count 
during the stroke event. HIV vasculopathy, a form of non-atherosclerotic outward 
remodeling, on the other hand, is associated with protracted immunosuppression. 
HIV vasculopathy was also linked to a thinner media layer and increased 
adventitial macrophages, suggestive of non-atherosclerotic degeneration of the 
brain arterial wall in the setting of chronic central nervous system 
inflammation. Cerebrovascular architecture seems to be differentially affected 
by HIV infection in successfully treated versus immunosuppressed PLWH. Brain 
large artery atherosclerosis is prevalent even with long-term immune 
reconstitution post-cART. HIV-associated changes in brain arterial walls may 
also relate to higher rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, although 
milder forms are more prevalent in the post-cART era. The underlying mechanisms 
of HIV-associated pathological arterial remodeling remain poorly understood, but 
a role has been proposed for chronic HIV-associated inflammation with increased 
burden on the vasculature. Neuroimaging may come to play a role in assessing 
brain arterial remodeling and stratifying cerebrovascular risk, but the data 
remains inconclusive. An improved understanding of the different phenotypes of 
brain arterial remodeling associated with HIV may reveal opportunities to reduce 
rates of cerebrovascular disease in the aging population of PLWH on cART.

Background: Continuous passive motion (CPM) is frequently used during 
rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Low-load resistance 
training (LLRT) using continuous active motion (CAM) devices is a promising 
alternative. We investigated the effectiveness of CPM compared to LLRT using the 
affected leg (CAMuni) and both legs (CAMbi) in the early post-operative 
rehabilitation.
HYPOTHESES: (I) LLRT (CAMuni and CAMbi) is superior to CPM, (II) additional 
training of the unaffected leg (CAMbi) is more effective than unilateral 
training (CAMuni). Materials and Methods: Eighty-five TKA patients were randomly 
assigned to three groups, respectively: (i) unilateral CPM of the operated leg; 
(ii) unilateral CAM of the operated leg (CAMuni); (iii) bilateral alternating 
CAM (CAMbi). Patients were assessed 1 day before TKA (pre-test), 1 day before 
discharge (post-test), and 3 months post-operatively (follow-up).
PRIMARY OUTCOME: active knee flexion range of motion (ROMFlex).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: active knee extension ROM (ROMExt), swelling, pain, 
C-reactive protein, quality of life (Qol), physical activity, timed-up-and-go 
performance, stair-climbing performance, quadriceps muscle strength. Analyses of 
covariances were performed (modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol). 
Results: Hypothesis I: Primary outcome: CAMbi resulted in a higher ROMFlex of 
9.0° (95%CI -18.03-0.04°, d = 0.76) and 6.3° (95%CI -14.31-0.99°, d = 0.61) 
compared to CPM at post-test and follow-up, respectively.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: At post-test, C-reactive protein was lower in both CAM 
groups compared with CPM. Knee pain was lower in CAMuni compared to CPM. 
Improved ROMExt, reduced swelling, better stair-climbing and timed-up-and-go 
performance were observed for CAMbi compared to CPM. At follow-up, both CAM 
groups reported higher Qol and CAMbi showed a better timed-up-and-go 
performance. Hypothesis II: Primary outcome: CAMbi resulted in a higher knee 
ROMFlex of 6.5° (95%CI -2.16-15.21°, d = 0.56) compared to CAMuni at post-test.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: At post-test, improved ROMExt, reduced swelling, and better 
timed-up-and-go performance were observed in CAMbi compared to CAMuni. 
Conclusions: Additional LLRT of the unaffected leg (CAMbi) seems to be more 
effective for recovery of function than training of the affected leg only 
(CAMuni), which may be mediated by positive transfer effects from the unaffected 
to the affected limb (cross education) and/or preserved neuromuscular function 
of the trained, unaffected leg. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: NCT02062138.

In aging populations for which the use of high loads is contraindicated, low 
load resistance training associated with blood flow restriction (RT-BFR) is an 
alternative strategy to induce muscle mass gains. This study investigates the 
effects of RT-BFR on muscle mass, muscle function, and quality of life of a 
99-year-old patient with knee osteoarthritis and advanced muscle mass 
deterioration. Training protocol consisted of 24 sessions of a unilateral 
free-weight knee extension exercise associated with partial blood flow 
restriction through a manometer cuff set at 50% of complete vascular occlusion 
pressure. We evaluated: cross-sectional area (CSA) and thickness (MT) of the 
vastus lateralis muscle by ultrasound; function through the Timed Up and Go 
(TUG) test; and quality of life (QoL) by the WHOQOL-bref, WHOQOL-OLD and WOMAC 
questionnaires. All tests were performed prior to the training period (Pre) and 
after the 12th (Mid) and 24th (Post) sessions. Changes were considered 
significant if higher than 2 times the measurement's coefficient of variation 
(CV). After 24 sessions, there was an increase of 12% in CSA and 8% in MT. 
Questionnaires scores and TUG values worsened from Pre to Mid and returned in 
Post. We consider RT-BFR a viable and effective strategy to promote muscle mass 
gains in nonagenarians and delay the decline in functionality and QoL associated 
with aging.

Experiences and views of Dutch general practitioners regarding 
physician-assisted death for patients suffering from severe mental illness: a 
mixed methods approach.

Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, physician-assisted death (PAD) is allowed under 
certain conditions. Patients who suffer from mental illnesses are not excluded 
from this practice. In 2018, general practitioners (GPs) performed 20 out of a 
total of 67 cases of EAS for psychiatric suffering.
OBJECTIVE: More insight into GPs' experiences and views with regard to PAD in 
psychiatry.
DESIGN: The data for this study were obtained through a survey amongst 500 
randomly selected Dutch GPs and by in-depth interviews with 20 Dutch GPs.
SETTING: A survey study and in-depth interviews.
SUBJECTS: Dutch GPs.
RESULTS: 86 out of 101 GPs found it conceivable to perform EAS in case of 
somatic disease, and 51 out of 104 GPs found it conceivable in the case a 
patient suffered from a mental illness only. The main reason given for refusing 
an PAD request was that the criteria of due care were not met. Reasons for 
supporting psychiatric PAD related to responsibility, self-determination, 
compassion, fairness, and preventing suicide. Reasons for not supporting 
psychiatric PAD were related to the scope of medicine, a perceived lack of 
experience, uncertainties regarding the criteria of due care and 
life-expectancy.
CONCLUSION: GPs are less likely to perform PAD for suffering from a mental 
illness, compared to somatic suffering. Some GPs apply an extra criterion of 
'life-expectancy' in case of PAD for suffering from a mental illness. Refusing 
PAD based on a long life expectancy keeps open the possibility of recovery, but 
may also just prolong the suffering and add to the unbearableness of it.KEY 
POINTSCurrently, there is no qualitative research on what the views are of 
general practitioners regarding the subject of physician-assisted death (PAD) 
for patients suffering from severe mental disorders.General practitioners are 
less likely to consider a request for physician-assisted death by a patient 
suffering from a psychiatric disorder, compared to somatic suffering. Reasons 
for supporting psychiatric PAD related to responsibility, self-determination, 
compassion, fairness, and preventing suicide.Reasons for not supporting 
psychiatric PAD were related to the scope of medicine, a perceived lack of 
experience, uncertainties regarding the criteria of due care and 
life-expectancy.Significance for the reader: Although allowed in the 
Netherlands, PAD in case of severe mental suffering remains a controversial 
topic. We need in-depth information about the actual practice of it to have an 
informed debate with regard to this subject.
