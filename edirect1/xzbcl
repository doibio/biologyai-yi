Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 13th most common cancer in the world and one 
of the few cancers for which incidence is increasing. This disease is generally 
asymptomatic at an early stage and is highly metastatic. Frequently discovered 
by physicians in the process of working up other diseases such as acute kidney 
injury, RCC is often discovered in an advanced form and many patients have 
metastases at the time of diagnosis. Given that life expectancy with currently 
approved therapies for metastatic RCC is approximately 1-2 years, biomarkers for 
RCC that will enable early detection are urgently needed. Although it is 
unlikely that highly sensitive and specific biomarkers will be identified in the 
near future that are useful for screening the general population, a noninvasive 
marker or set of markers could soon be used in general medicine, nephrology, and 
urology clinics to screen patients at increased risk of RCC. In addition to the 
ongoing need for RCC biomarkers, the frequent resistance reported with currently 
available targeted therapies makes the identification of new therapeutic targets 
similarly important. Many promising leads for new targeted therapies have come 
to light; some of these therapies are in clinical trials and others are still 
being evaluated in the laboratory.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors have been shown to increase the risks 
of overall infection and serious infection in rheumatoid arthritis. However, it 
is uncertain whether we can draw the same conclusion in the psoriatic 
population. This article focuses on the 3 most commonly used TNF-α inhibitors in 
psoriasis: adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab. In order to assess the risks 
of overall infection and serious infection in patients with psoriasis, we 
reviewed the underlying mechanism of the potential infection risk, different 
types of serious infection associated with TNF-α inhibitors, and current 
evidence in the psoriatic population. Results from 11 randomized controlled 
trials and open-label extension studies showed that there was no apparent 
significant association between the use of TNF-α inhibitors and increasing risks 
of overall infection and serious infection. Because of the limitations of 
current evidence, large, long-term follow-up studies with appropriate control 
groups using real-life data, such as postmarket surveillance, are warranted.

INTRODUCTION: Ticagrelor is a novel antiplatelet drug developed to reduce 
atherothrombosis. The PLATO trial compared ticagrelor and aspirin to clopidogrel 
and aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Ticagrelor was 
found to be superior in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction or stroke, without increasing major bleeding events. The 
current study estimates the lifetime cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor relative 
to generic clopidogrel from a Singapore public healthcare perspective.
METHODS: This study used a two-part cost-effectiveness model. The first part was 
a 12-month decision tree (using PLATO trial data) to estimate the rates of major 
cardiovascular events, healthcare costs and health-related quality of life. The 
second part was a Markov model estimating lifetime quality-adjusted survival and 
costs conditional on events during the initial 12 months. Daily drug costs 
applied were SGD 1.05 (generic clopidogrel) and SGD 6.00 (ticagrelor). Cost per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated from a Singapore public 
healthcare perspective using life tables and short-term costs from Singapore, 
and long-term costs from South Korea. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Ticagrelor was associated with a lifetime QALY gain of 0.13, primarily 
driven by lower mortality. The resulting incremental cost per QALY gained was 
SGD 10,136.00. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ticagrelor had 
a > 99% probability of being cost-effective, given the lower recommended WHO 
willingness-to-pay threshold of one GDP/capita per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Based on PLATO trial data, one-year treatment with ticagrelor versus 
generic clopidogrel in patients with ACS, relative to WHO reference standards, 
is cost-effective from a Singapore public healthcare perspective.

According to estimates, 1.2 million Americans are infected with human immuno 
deficiency virus (HIV). Because of antiretroviral therapy, persons who have HIV 
infection or have progressed to AIDS are living longer. As a result, the 
likelihood that they will need critical care nursing is increasing. Unlike in 
years past, when these patients were often admitted because of the consequences 
of immunosuppression, today they are also being cared for in critical care units 
for other conditions associated with aging, other chronic health conditions, and 
trauma. When persons who have HIV disease or AIDS are admitted to the intensive 
care unit, nurses must be prepared to provide care, especially management of 
complexities associated with antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, this article 
examines critical care nurses' role in initiating and administering 
antiretroviral therapy in the intensive care unit and reducing the risk of drug 
interactions associated with the therapy.

BACKGROUND: Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant direct thrombin inhibitor 
recently registered in South Africa (SA) to reduce the risk of stroke and 
systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Owing to the price 
disparity between warfarin (the current gold standard for treatment of patients 
with AF) and dabigatran, we conducted an economic appraisal of the use of 
dabigatran compared with warfarin from a payer perspective in the South African 
private healthcare setting.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) and budget impact of 
dabigatran compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in AF patients. 
Methods. A previously published Markov model was populated with SA cost and 
mortality data to estimate the CE and budget impact analysis of dabigatran over 
a lifetime horizon. The model population consisted of a cohort of patients of 
whom those aged younger than 80 years used dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and 
those older than 80 years 110 mg twice daily. Modelled outcomes included total 
cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental CE ratio (ICER), with 
the effectiveness measured by QALYs gained.
RESULTS: Dabigatran compared with warfarin as first-line treatment was estimated 
to have an ICER of R93 290 and an average incremental cost per beneficiary per 
month of R0.39 over a 5-year period. Conservative assumptions were made 
regarding the number of international normalised ratio monitoring tests for 
patients on warfarin, and the ICER is estimated to decrease by as much as 15.7% 
under less stringent assumptions. A robust sensitivity analysis was also 
performed.
CONCLUSION: Dabigatran as first-line treatment compared with warfarin for the 
use of stroke prevention in patients with AF is deemed cost-effective when used 
in accordance with its registered indication in the SA private sector.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the 
UK after breast and lung cancer. People with metastatic disease who are 
sufficiently fit are usually treated with active chemotherapy as first- or 
second-line therapy. Recently, targeted agents have become available including 
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents, for example cetuximab and 
panitumumab, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor agents, 
for example bevacizumab.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
panitumumab monotherapy and cetuximab (mono- or combination chemotherapy) for 
Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) wild-type (WT) patients, and bevacizumab in 
combination with non-oxaliplatin chemotherapy, for the treatment of metastatic 
colorectal cancer after first-line chemotherapy.
DATA SOURCES: The assessment comprises a systematic review of clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, a review and critique of 
manufacturer submissions and a de novo cohort-based economic analysis. For the 
assessment of effectiveness, a literature search was conducted in a range of 
electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, from 
2005 to November 2010.
REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) or systematic reviews of RCTs of cetuximab, bevacizumab or panitumumab in 
participants with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer with KRAS WT 
status that has progressed after first-line chemotherapy (for cetuximab and 
panitumumab) or participants with metastatic colorectal cancer that has 
progressed after first-line chemotherapy (bevacizumab). All steps in the review 
were performed by one reviewer and checked independently by a second. Synthesis 
was mainly narrative. An economic model was developed focusing on third-line and 
subsequent lines of treatment. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per 
annum. Probabilistic and univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: The searches identified 7745 titles and abstracts. Two clinical trials 
(reported in 12 papers) were included. No data were available for bevacizumab in 
combination with non-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in previously treated 
patients. Neither of the included studies had KRAS status performed 
prospectively, but the studies did report retrospective analyses of the results 
for the KRAS WT subgroups. Third-line treatment with cetuximab plus best 
supportive care or panitumumab plus best supportive care appears to have 
statistically significant advantages over treatment with best supportive care 
alone in patients with KRAS WT status. For the economic evaluation, five studies 
met the inclusion criteria. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for KRAS WT patients for cetuximab compared with best supportive care is 
£98,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), for panitumumab compared with 
best supportive care is £150,000 per QALY and for cetuximab plus irinotecan 
compared with best supportive care is £88,000 per QALY. All ICERs are sensitive 
to treatment duration.
LIMITATIONS: In the specific populations of interest, there is a lack of 
evidence on bevacizumab, cetuximab and cetuximab plus irinotecan used second 
line and on bevacizumab and cetuximab plus irinotecan used third line. For 
cetuximab plus irinotecan treatment for KRAS WT people, there is no direct 
evidence on progression-free survival, overall survival and duration of 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although cetuximab and panitumumab appear to be clinically 
beneficial for KRAS WT patients compared with best supportive care, they are 
likely to represent poor value for money when judged by cost-effectiveness 
criteria currently used in the UK. It would be useful to conduct a RCT for 
patients with KRAS WT status receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan.

Human sirtuins: an overview of an emerging drug target in age-related diseases 
and cancer.

Sir2-like proteins (Sirtuins) are a class of enzymes conserved throughout the 
kingdoms of life. In fact, from Archaea to Mammals, these (class III) 
NAD+-dependent deacetylases catalyse the removal of the acetyl moiety from a 
substrate protein. Sirtuins show a conserved central catalytic domain with two 
more variable amino- and carboxy-terminal flanking regions. Amino acid 
comparison of these central conserved catalytic core sequences allows us to 
divide Sirtuins into five different classes (I, II, III, IV and U). These 
proteins differ in their subcellular localization (i.e. in Eukaryotes they can 
be found in the nucleus, cytoplasm or mitochondria). In humans there are seven 
Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) that are implicated in various physiological processes 
including aging and age-related disorders such as neoplasms, cardiovascular, 
metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. Nowadays, the 
estimated life expectancy is definitely longer than in the past thus, we may 
consider all aging-related problems as having a strong social impact. 
Consequently, Sirtuins are emerging, particularly from a pharmacological point 
of view, as new and valuable drug targets.

of Oriental Medicine, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal obesity (AO) is a medical condition in which excess body 
fat accumulates in the abdomen. It may cause adverse effects on health and 
result in reduced life expectancy or increased health problems. While various 
genetic approaches have explained the risks of AO in Western society, the Sasang 
constitution (SC) has been identified as a risk factor in Korean medicine. 
Different SC types are associated with different fat distribution, body shapes 
and susceptibility to diseases. We evaluated whether the SC type could be a risk 
for AO in a cross-sectional study among Koreans.
METHODS: In total, 2,528 subjects aged over 30 years were recruited from 23 
medical clinics. We collected waist circumference (WC), weight, height, and some 
clinical information for AO from the subjects. A Chi-square test and a one-way 
ANOVA were performed according to SC type (p < .05), while multiple logistic 
regression was used to produce odds ratios (ORs).
RESULTS: The rates of AO in Tae-eumin (TE), Soeumin (SE), and Soyangin (SY) 
types were 63.7%, 14.7%, and 32.8% in males and 84.8%, 41.7%, and 52.8% in 
females, respectively. The TE type was associated with increased AO prevalence 
compared with the SE and SY types in males (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.02-3.15, p = 0.044 
and OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.18-2.58, p = 0.006, respectively) and females (OR 1.51; 
95% CI 1.03-2.23, p = 0.037 and OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.32-2.68, p < 0.001, 
respectively) after adjusting for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that SC, particularly the TE type, might be 
significantly and independently associated with AO and could be considered a 
risk factor in predicting AO.

Cost-effectiveness of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin for stroke 
prevention in atrial fibrillation.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University 
of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721-0202, USA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention 
in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation by using novel oral 
anticoagulants apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg compared 
with warfarin.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model was constructed using data from 
clinical trials to evaluate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years of 
novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. The modeled population was a 
hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation, increased risk for stroke (CHADS2 ≥ 1), renal creatinine clearance 
≥ 50 mL/min, and no previous contraindications to anticoagulation. The 
willingness-to-pay threshold was $50 000/quality-adjusted life-years gained.
RESULTS: In the base case, warfarin had the lowest cost of $77 813 (SD, $2223), 
followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg ($78 738 ± $1852), dabigatran 150 mg ($82 719 ± 
$1959), and apixaban 5 mg ($85 326 ± $1512). Apixaban 5 mg had the highest 
quality-adjusted life-years estimate at 8.47 (SD, 0.06), followed by dabigatran 
150 mg (8.41 ± 0.07), rivaroxaban 20 mg (8.26 ± 0.06), and warfarin (7.97 ± 
0.04). In a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, apixaban 5 mg, 
dabigatran 150 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and warfarin were cost-effective in 45.1%, 
40%, 14.9%, 0% of the simulations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and an increased 
risk of stroke prophylaxis, apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 
mg were all cost-effective alternatives to warfarin. The cost-effectiveness of 
novel oral anticoagulantss was dependent on therapy pricing in the United States 
and neurological events associated with rivaroxaban 20 mg.

We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of all Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) 
submitted for biologicals in Europe from 1995 to 2009 by comparing two 
regulatory scenarios: full regulation (PSUR reporting) and limited regulation 
(no PSUR reporting, but all other parts of the pharmacovigilance framework 
remain in place). During this period, PSUR reporting resulted in the detection 
of 2 out of a total of 24 urgent safety issues for biologicals: (i) distant 
spread of botulinum toxin and (ii) edema/fluid collection associated with 
off-label use of dibotermin-alfa. We used Markov-chain life tables to calculate 
costs and health effects of PSURs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of full regulation (PSUR reporting) vs. limited regulation (no PSUR 
reporting) for the base-case scenario was \[euro]342,110 per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. It is possible to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
regulatory requirements using the same methods as those used in assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of medical interventions.

Author information:
(1)Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of 
California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

IMPORTANCE: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients treated with 
antiretroviral therapy now have increased life expectancy and develop chronic 
illnesses that are often seen in older HIV-negative patients.
OBJECTIVE: To address emerging issues related to aging with HIV. Screening older 
adults for HIV, diagnosis of concomitant diseases, management of multiple 
comorbid medical illnesses, social isolation, polypharmacy, and factors 
associated with end-of-life care are reviewed.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Published guidelines and consensus statements were 
reviewed. PubMed and PsycINFO were searched between January 2000 and February 
2013. Articles not appearing in the search that were referenced by reviewed 
articles were also evaluated.
FINDINGS: The population of older HIV-positive patients is rapidly expanding. It 
is estimated that by 2015 one-half of the individuals in the United States with 
HIV will be older than age 50. Older HIV-infected patients are prone to having 
similar chronic diseases as their HIV-negative counterparts, as well as 
illnesses associated with co-infections. Medical treatments associated with 
these conditions, when added to an antiretroviral regimen, increase risk for 
polypharmacy. Care of aging HIV-infected patients involves a need to balance a 
number of concurrent comorbid medical conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: HIV is no longer a fatal disease. Management of 
multiple comorbid diseases is a common feature associated with longer life 
expectancy in HIV-positive patients. There is a need to better understand how to 
optimize the care of these patients.

Characteristics and activity analysis of epothilone operon promoters from 
Sorangium cellulosum strains in Escherichia coli.

(1)State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, School of Life Science, 
Shandong University, Jinan, 250100, China.

The epothilones, compounds with anticancer mechanisms similar to that of 
paclitaxel (Taxol), are produced by strains of the myxobacterium Sorangium 
cellulosum, and the gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis is 
organised as a large operon. In this work, we showed that the 440-bp promoter 
regions of the operons from eight S. cellulosum strains have 94.27 % DNA 
sequence identity and 50 % variability in promoter activity in Escherichia coli. 
A primer extension analysis revealed two transcriptional start sites (TSSs) at 
246 (TSS1) and 193 bp (TSS2) upstream of the translation start site (TLS), 
respectively. Promoter truncation determined that the basal promoter from the 
So0157-2 strain is located within a 264-bp region containing weak promoter 
activity; whereas in the 38-bp region upstream, the 264-bp promoter was required 
for the strong promoter activity, which was dramatically increased by 11-fold in 
average. There was a conserved stem-loop structure between TSS2 and the TLS, 
which was identified in E. coli as a negative regulatory element. In addition, 
the upstream non-conserved 357-bp non-coding region contributes to the promoter 
activity, increasing it by 1.5-fold. In conclusion, the expression of the 
epothilone operon non-coding region in E. coli is regulated by a double promoter 
(with -35 and -10 regions and two distinct TSSs), a stem-loop structure, and a 
distal non-coding region.

Cost effectiveness of fecal DNA screening for colorectal cancer: a systematic 
review and quality appraisal of the literature.

BACKGROUND: Fecal DNA (fDNA) testing is a noninvasive potential alternative to 
current colorectal cancer screening tests.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and quality assessment of studies of 
cost-effectiveness of fDNA as a colorectal cancer screening tool (compared with 
no screening and other screening modalities), and identified key variables that 
impinged on cost-effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Centre for Reviews and 
Dissemination for cost-effectiveness studies of fDNA-based screening, published 
in English by September 2011.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that undertook an economic evaluation of fDNA, using 
either a cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis, compared with other 
relevant screening modalities and/or no screening were included. Additional 
inclusion criteria related to the presentation of data pertaining to model 
variables including time horizon, costs, fDNA performance characteristics, 
screening uptake, and comparators. A total of 369 articles were initially 
identified for review. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, seven articles were included in the final review.
STUDY APPRAISAL: Data was abstracted on key descriptor variables including 
screening scenarios, time horizon, costs, test performance characteristics, 
screening uptake, comparators, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Quality assessment was undertaken using a standard checklist for economic 
evaluations. Studies cited by cost-effectiveness articles as the source of data 
on fDNA test performance characteristics were also reviewed.
RESULTS: Seven cost-effectiveness studies were included, from the USA (4), 
Canada (1), Israel (1), and Taiwan (1). Markov models (5), a partially 
observable Markov decision process model (1) and MISCAN and SimCRC (1) 
microsimulation models were used. All studies took a third-party payer 
perspective and one included, in addition, a societal perspective. Comparator 
screening tests, screening intervals, and specific fDNA tests varied between 
studies. fDNA sensitivity and specificity parameters were derived from 12 
research studies and one meta-analysis. Outcomes assessed were life-years gained 
and quality-adjusted life-years gained. fDNA was cost-effective when compared 
with no screening in six studies. Compared with other screening modalities, fDNA 
was not considered cost-effective in any of the base-case analyses: in five 
studies it was dominated by all alternatives considered. Sensitivity analyses 
identified cost, compliance, and test parameters as key influential parameters. 
In general, poor presentation of "study design" and "data collection" details 
lowered the quality of included articles.
LIMITATIONS: Although the literature searches were designed for high 
sensitivity, the possibility cannot be excluded that some eligible studies may 
have been missed. Reports (such as Health Technology Assessments produced by 
government agencies) and other forms of grey literature were excluded because 
they are difficult to identify systematically and/or may not report methods and 
results in sufficient detail for assessment.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of the available (albeit limited) evidence, while fDNA 
is cost-effective when compared with no screening, it is currently dominated by 
most of the other available screening options. Cost and test performance appear 
to be the main influences on cost-effectiveness.

The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social--always sensitive to the needs of 
health of the beneficiary population and to the demographic and epidemiological 
changes of the society--has developed and implemented DiabetlMSS, a program of 
attention to the diabetic patient. DiabetlMSS organizes care processes based on 
the needs and values of the patients, through simultaneous activities of 
individual consultation and group meetings granted by the multidisciplinary 
health team. These actions and activities are focused to affect patients' 
lifestyles positively. Through a plan of nutrition, physical activity, self-care 
and monitoring, this program increases the interaction between patients, by 
having an exchange of successful experiences about diabetes control. DiabetlMSS 
was created with the purpose that the patients achieve the metabolic control and 
identify complications early on, with the perspective of timely intervention 
that is reflected in the decrease of the catastrophic effects that causes the 
disease, both for patient's life expectancy and the quality of care provided by 
the Institute.

More than any other circumstances, life-threatening emergencies require rapid 
and appropriate management. Public involvement is, in many cases, essential for 
optimal outcome. The victim, a relative or a bystander, if they do the right 
thing, can facilitate emergency service intervention. Adult sudden cardiac death 
is one area where public involvement has been particularly encouraged. Based on 
this experience, the aim of this article is to examine possible extension to 
other life-threatening emergencies, as well as the consequences of this 
involvement in terms of public health and community awareness.

INTRODUCTION: With the advancement in the field of medical colloids and 
interfacial sciences, the life expectancy has been greatly improved. In 
addition, changes in the human lifestyle resulted in development of various 
organic and functional disorders. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders are 
most prevalent and increasing among population worldwide. The neurological 
disorders are multi-systemic and difficult to treat as portal entry to brain is 
restricted on account of its anatomical and physiological barrier.
AREAS COVERED: The present review discusses the limitations to CNS drug 
delivery, and the various approaches to bypass the blood brain barrier (BBB), 
focusing on the potential use of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for drug 
targeting to brain. The methods currently in use for SLN production, 
physicochemical characterization and critical issues related to the formulation 
development suitable for targeting brain are also discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: The potential advantages of the use of SLN over polymeric 
nanoparticles are due to their lower cytotoxicity, higher drug loading capacity 
and scalability. In addition, their production is cost effective and the systems 
provide a drug release in a controlled manner up to several weeks. Drug 
targeting potential of SLN can be enhanced by attaching ligands to their 
surface.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost effectiveness of sevelamer vs calcium 
carbonate in patients with chronic kidney disease and not on dialysis (CKD-ND) 
from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate (1) total 
life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs for patients 
treated with sevelamer or calcium carbonate; and (2) incremental costs per LY 
gained (LYG) and per QALY gained for sevelamer vs calcium carbonate. Data 
informing probability transitions to all-cause death and dialysis inception in 
CKD-ND patients were taken directly from the INDEPENDENT-CKD study and were 
extrapolated beyond the 3-year clinical trial using Weibull regression analysis. 
Estimates of health utility and costs (in £2011) were derived from the published 
literature.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, sevelamer treatment resulted in a gain of 2.05 
LYs and 1.56 QALYs per patient, an increase of £37,282 in total costs per 
patient vs calcium carbonate (3.5% discount), and a per-patient cost of 
£18,193/LYG and £23,878/QALY gained. Results were robust to alternative 
assumptions in key parameters; results were most sensitive to alternative 
assumptions regarding the mean daily dose of sevelamer, impact of sevelamer on 
dialysis initiation, cost of dialysis, and health utility estimates. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that sevelamer was cost-effective vs 
calcium carbonate in 93% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£30,000/QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: While the model simulated a real-world clinical setting, this 
analysis was subject to limitations common to all decision analytic models, in 
that it used a mix of data sources and relied on several assumptions. Not all 
variables that impact real-world outcomes and costs were included in this model.
CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer is a cost-effective option compared to calcium carbonate 
for the first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD-ND patients in the UK.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: The burden of disease, describing loss of health and death due to a 
disease, has not been fully studied for melanoma in the general population over 
time.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the burden of disease due to melanoma in the 
Netherlands.
METHODS: Age- and sex-specific incidence data from all patients with melanoma in 
the Netherlands between 1991 and 2010 were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer 
Registry. Melanoma-specific mortality and life expectancy data were obtained 
from Statistics Netherlands. Melanoma duration was calculated using the DISMOD 
software from the World Health Organization. The years of life lived with 
disability (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) due to melanoma were calculated 
using Dutch disability weights, incidence and mortality of melanoma, and the 
life expectancy from the general population. The number of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) was estimated by adding YLD and YLL.
RESULTS: The world-standardized incidence rates of melanoma have more than 
doubled for both men (7·1 per 100 000 inhabitants in 1991 to 17·0 in 2010) and 
women (9·4 per 100 000 inhabitants in 1991 to 19·8 in 2010). Likewise, the 
burden of melanoma to society has increased rapidly. The YLD for men increased 
from 4795 (1991-4) to 12 441 (2007-10), and for women from 7513 (1991-4) to 16 
544 (2007-10). In 2007-10 the total YLL due to melanoma was 30 651 for men and 
26 244 for women compared with 17 238 and 16 900, respectively, in 1991-4. The 
DALYs increased by 96% for men, from 22 033 (1991-4) to 43 092 (2007-10), and by 
75% for women, from 24 413 (1991-4) to 42 788 (2007-10).
CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma is becoming a great burden to Dutch society.

This study explored the age-related deterioration in stretch-shortening cycle 
(SSC) muscle power and concurrent force-velocity properties in women and men 
across the adult life span. A total of 315 participants (women: n = 188; men: 
n = 127) aged 18-81 years performed maximal countermovement jumps on an 
instrumented force plate. Maximal SSC leg extension power expressed per kg body 
mass (Ppeak) was greater in men than in women across the adult age span 
(P < 0.001); however, this gender difference was progressively reduced with 
increasing age, because men showed an ∼50% faster rate of decline in SSC power 
than women (P < 0.001). Velocity at peak power (VPpeak) was greater in men than 
in women (P < 0.001) but declined at a greater rate in men than in women 
(P = 0.002). Vertical ground reaction force at peak power (FPpeak) was higher in 
men than in women in younger adults only (P < 0.001) and the age-related decline 
was steeper in men than in women (P < 0.001). Men demonstrated a steeper rate of 
decline in Ppeak than women with progressive aging. This novel finding emerged 
as a result of greater age-related losses in men for both force and velocity. 
Consequently, maximal SSC power production was observed to converge between 
genders when approaching old age.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction (ED), is 
common in men with type 2 diabetes, occurring in up to 75% of cases. The 
prevalence of hypogonadism is also high in men with diabetes and low 
testosterone is associated with both sexual dysfunction and a reduced response 
to oral therapy for ED.
AIM: This study aimed to determine the effect of testosterone replacement with 
long-acting Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) on sexual function, mood and quality 
of life vs. placebo over a treatment period of 30 weeks followed by 52 weeks of 
open-label medication. The study was conducted in a primary care population of 
men with type 2 diabetes attending their primary care physician for routine 
visits.
METHODS: The male diabetic populations of seven general practices were screened 
at routine diabetes visits to detect symptomatic men with total testosterone 
levels of 12 nmol/L or less or with free testosterones of 250 pmol/L or less. 
Two hundred eleven men were screened. A double-blind placebo-controlled study 
was conducted in 199 men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism treated for 30 
weeks with either 1,000 mg of TU or matching placebo followed by 52-week 
open-label follow on.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure, International Index of 
Erectile Function (IIEF), was used to evaluate sexual dysfunction, and the 
Ageing Male Symptom (AMS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Global 
Efficacy Question were used as secondary outcome measures to assess mood and 
self-reported quality of life.
RESULTS: Testosterone replacement therapy with long-acting TU improved all 
domains of sexual function at 30 weeks (erectile function [EF], P = 0.005; 
intercourse satisfaction, P = 0.015; sexual desire, P = 0.001; overall 
satisfaction, P = 0.05; and orgasm, P = 0.04), with benefit as early as 6 weeks. 
Improvements in AMS score were significant in men without depression (P = 0.02) 
and the presence of depression at baseline was associated with marked reduction 
in response to both sexual function and psychological scores. All responses in 
sexual function continued to improve significantly up to 18 months with an 
improvement in EF score of 4.31 from baseline. In a small cohort of 35 men 
taking phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, there was no change during the 
double-blind phase but a nine-point improvement in EF domain during 52-week 
open-label treatment. After 30 weeks, 46% vs. 17% of patients on active therapy 
vs. placebo felt that the treatment had improved their health, reaching 70% 
after open-label therapy. Less obese and older patients responded better to 
testosterone therapy. There were no significant adverse events.
CONCLUSION: TU significantly improved all domains of the IIEF and patient 
reported quality of life at 30 weeks and more significantly after 52-week 
open-label extension. Improvement was most marked in less obese patient and 
those without coexisting depression. In men with type 2 diabetes, trials of 
therapy may need to be given for much longer than 3-6 months suggested in 
current guidelines.

Burden of disease due to dementia in the elderly population of Korea: present 
and future.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: With the rapid aging of populations around the world, dementia has 
become one of the most important public health problems in Eastern Asian 
countries. The purpose of the present study was to provide an estimate of the 
burden of dementia and forecast its future burden, as generalized to the Korean 
population, and to provide detailed gender- and age-specific information 
regarding the burden of dementia in the elderly population of Korea.
METHODS: 'Disability-adjusted life years' (DALYs) were used to estimate the 
burden of dementia. Epidemiologic data from national statistics and nationwide 
epidemiologic studies in the year 2008 were used to obtain representative 
outcomes for the Korean population. We estimated the DALYs due to dementia from 
the years 2010 to 2050 by applying demographic structure projections in terms of 
5-year age groups in Korea.
RESULTS: The burden of disease due to dementia in Korea is 528 per 100,000 
population (males: 435, females: 622) and 5,117 per 100,000 in those over the 
age of 65 years (males: 5,228; females: 5,041); this accounts for 4.5% of the 
total burden of disease in the year 2008. In the year 2050, DALYs due to 
dementia (814,629) are expected to be 3.0 times higher than those in the year 
2010 (274,849).
CONCLUSION: Dementia has the highest burden of disease in the elderly Korean 
population, and this burden will increase sharply with the aging of the 
population. More comprehensive and multi-dimensional approaches, including 
clinical, psychological, social, and political means will be needed for the 
management of the dramatically increasing burden of dementia.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Clinical staging 
classification is generally insufficient to provide a reliable prognosis, 
particularly for early stages. In addition, prognostic factors are therefore 
needed to better forecast life expectancy and optimize adjuvant therapeutic 
strategy. Recent evidence indicates that alterations of the DNA replication 
program contribute to neoplasia from its early stages and that cancer cells are 
frequently exposed to endogenous replication stress. We therefore hypothesized 
that genes involved in the replication stress response may represent an 
under-explored source of biomarkers. Expressions of 77 DNA 
replication-associated genes implicated in different aspects of chromosomal DNA 
replication, including licensing, firing of origins, elongation, replication 
fork maintenance and recovery, lesion bypass and post-replicative repair were 
determined in primary tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 93 patients 
suffering from early- or mid-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We then 
investigated a statistically significant interaction between gene expressions 
and survival of early-stage NSCLC patients.The expression of five genes, that 
is, POLQ, PLK1, RAD51, CLASPIN and CDC6 was associated with overall, 
disease-free and relapse-free survival. The expression levels are independent of 
treatment and stage classification. Except RAD51, their prognostic role on 
survival persists after adjustment on age, sex, treatment, stage classification 
and conventional proliferation markers, with a hazard ratio of 36.3 for POLQ 
(95%CI 2.6-517.4, P=0.008), 23.5 for PLK1 (95%CI 1.9-288.4, P=0.01), 20.7 for 
CLASPIN (95%CI 1.5-275.9, P=0.02) and 18.5 for CDC6 (95%CI 1.3-267.4, P=0.03). 
We also show that a five-gene signature including POLQ, PLK1, RAD51, CLASPIN and 
CDC6 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups, with a hazard ratio of 
14.3 (95% CI 5.1-40.3, P<0.001). This 'replication stress' metamarker may be a 
reliable predictor of survival for NSCLC, and may also help understand the 
molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression.

The 'N-factors' in pancreatic cancer: functional relevance of NF-κB, NFAT and 
Nrf2 in pancreatic cancer.

Internal Medicine I, Kiel, Germany.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest 
malignancies, with an overall life expectancy of 6 months. Despite considerable 
advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
carcinogenesis of PDAC, the outcome of the disease was not significantly 
improved over the last 20 years. Although some achievements in 
molecular-targeted therapies have been made (that is, targeting the epidermal 
growth factor receptor by erlotinib), which already entered clinical settings, 
and despite the promising outcome of the FOLFIRINOX trial, there is an urgent 
need for improvement of the chemotherapy in this disease. A plethora of 
molecular alterations are thought to be responsible for the profound 
chemoresistance, including mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Besides 
these classical hallmarks of cancer, the constitutive or inducible activity of 
transcription factor pathways are characteristic changes in PDAC. Recently, 
three transcription factors-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor of 
activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-have been 
shown to be crucial for tumor development and chemoresistance in pancreatic 
cancer. These transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes 
involved in nearly all aspects of tumorigenesis and resistance against 
chemotherapeutics and death receptor ligands. Furthermore, the pathways of 
NF-κB, NFAT and Nrf2 are functional, interacting on several regulatory steps, 
and, especially, natural compounds such as curcumin interfere with more than one 
pathway. Thus, targeting these pathways by established inhibitors or new drugs 
might have great potential to improve the outcome of PDAC patients, most likely 
in combination with established anticancer drugs. In this article, we summarize 
recent progress in the characterization of these transcription-factor pathways 
and their role in PDAC and therapy resistance. We also discuss future concepts 
for the treatment of PDAC relying on these pathways.
