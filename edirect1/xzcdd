within the host bacterium. This fast replication overcrowds and in turn destroys 
the host bacterium. In the lysogenic pathway, however, the bacteriophage inserts 
its DNA into the host genome, and is replicated simultaneously with the host 
genome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, a mathematical predictive 
model was developed to estimate fitness as an index of survived offspring. We 
then leverage experimental data to validate the predictive power of our proposed 
model. A mathematical model based on game theory was also generated to elucidate 
a rationale behind cell decision.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that a rational decision that is aimed to 
maximize life expectancy of offspring is almost identical to bacteriophage 
behavior reported based on experimental data. The results also showed that 
stochastic decision on cell fate maximizes the expected number of survived 
offspring.
CONCLUSION: We present a mathematical framework for analyzing a basic phenotypic 
variation problem and explain how bacteriophages maximize offspring longevity 
based on this model. We also introduce a mathematical benchmark for other 
investigations of phenotypic variation that exists in eukaryotes including stem 
cell differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes a significant health and economic 
burden to the Dutch society. Dabigatran was proven to have at least similar 
efficacy and a similar or better safety profile when compared to vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs) in preventing arterial thromboembolism in patients with AF.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and monetary benefit of dabigatran 
vs VKAs in Dutch patients with non-valvular AF. Value-based pricing 
considerations and corresponding negotiations on dabigatran will be explicitly 
considered.
METHODS: The base case economic analysis was conducted from the societal 
perspective. Health effects and costs were analysed using a Markov model. The 
main model inputs were derived from the RE-LY trial and Dutch observational 
data. Univariate, probabilistic sensitivity, and various scenario analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs. A total of 4,552 QALYs 
were gained, and €13,892,288 was saved in a cohort of 10,000 AF patients. The 
economic value of dabigatran was strongly related to the costs of VKA control 
that are averted. Notably, dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs if annual 
costs of VKA control exceeded €159 per person, or dabigatran costs were below 
€2.81 per day.
CONCLUSION: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs for the prevention of 
atrial thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular AF in the Netherlands. This 
result appeared robust in the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, volume based 
reduction of the price in the Netherlands will further increase the monetary 
benefits of dabigatran.

BACKGROUND: Cellulitis is a painful, potentially serious, infectious process of 
the dermal and subdermal tissues and represents a significant disease burden. 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the Penicillin for the Emergency 
Department Outpatient treatment of CELLulitis (PEDOCELL) trial is described 
here. The PEDOCELL trial is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, 
double-blinded, non-inferiority clinical trial comparing the efficacy of 
flucloxacillin (monotherapy) with combination 
flucloxacillin/phenoxymethylpenicillin (dual therapy) for the outpatient 
treatment of cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) setting. To prevent 
outcome reporting bias, selective reporting and data-driven results, the a 
priori-defined, detailed SAP is presented here.
METHODS/DESIGN: Patients will be randomised to either orally administered 
flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily and placebo or orally administered 500 mg 
of flucloxacillin four times daily and phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg four times 
daily. The trial consists of a 7-day intervention period and a 2-week follow-up 
period. Study measurements will be taken at four specific time points: at 
patient enrolment, day 2-3 after enrolment and commencing treatment (early 
clinical response (ECR) visit), day 8-10 after enrolment (end-of-treatment (EOT) 
visit) and day 14-21 after enrolment (test-of-cure (TOC) visit). The primary 
outcome measure is investigator-determined clinical response measured at the TOC 
visit. The secondary outcomes are as follows: lesion size at ECR, clinical 
treatment failure at each follow-up visit, adherence and persistence of trial 
patients with orally administered antibiotic therapy at EOT, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and pharmacoeconomic assessments. The plan for the 
presentation and comparison of baseline characteristics and outcomes is 
described in this paper.
DISCUSSION: This trial aims to establish the non-inferiority of orally 
administered flucloxacillin monotherapy with orally administered 
flucloxacillin/phenoxymethylpenicillin dual therapy for the ED-directed 
outpatient treatment of cellulitis. In doing so, this trial will bridge a 
knowledge gap in this understudied and common condition and will be relevant to 
clinicians across several different disciplines. The SAP for the PEDOCELL trial 
was developed a priori in order to minimise analysis bias.

AIMS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive form of leukemia with 
a poor prognosis in adult patients. The addition of the monoclonal antibody 
rituximab to standard chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in adults 
with ALL. However, it is unknown whether the addition of rituximab is 
cost-effective. The objective was to determine the economic impact of rituximab 
in addition to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy vs SOC alone in 
newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative, CD20-positive, B-cell 
precursor ALL.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed, based upon the Canadian 
healthcare system. It included the following health states over a lifetime 
horizon (max ≈60 years): event-free survival (EFS), relapsed/resistant disease, 
cure, and death. SOC was either hyper-CVAD or the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 
(DFCI) ALL consortium. EFS, overall survival, and serious adverse event (SAE) 
rates were derived from a large randomized controlled trial. Costs of the model 
included: first-line treatment and administration, disease management, 
second-line and third-line treatment and administration, palliative care, and 
SAE-related treatments. Inputs were sourced from provincial and national public 
data, the literature, and cancer agency input.
RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by 2.20 QALYs with 
rituximab in addition to SOC. The resulting mean Incremental Cost-Effectiveness 
Ratio (ICER) was C$21,828/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
C$100,000/QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 98%. Decision 
outcomes were robust to the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity 
analyses, including the SOC backbone as either hyper-CVAD or DFCI.
LIMITATIONS: The results of this analysis are limited by generalizability of the 
chemotherapy backbone to Canadian practice.
CONCLUSIONS: For adults with ALL, rituximab in addition to SOC was found to be a 
cost-effective intervention, compared to SOC alone. The addition of rituximab is 
associated with increased life years and increased QALYs at a reasonable 
incremental cost.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination is the best measure to prevent influenza. We conducted a 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza 
vaccination, compared to no vaccination, in children ≤60 months of age 
participating in a prospective cohort study in Bangkok, Thailand.
METHODS: A static decision tree model was constructed to simulate the population 
of children in the cohort. Proportions of children with laboratory-confirmed 
influenza were derived from children followed weekly. The societal perspective 
and one-year analytic horizon were used for each influenza season; the model was 
repeated for three influenza seasons (2012-2014). Direct and indirect costs 
associated with influenza illness were collected and summed. Cost of the 
trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV3) including promotion, 
administration, and supervision cost was added for children who were vaccinated. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALY), derived from literature, were used to 
quantify health outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
calculated as the difference in the expected total costs between the vaccinated 
and unvaccinated groups divided by the difference in QALYs for both groups.
RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, IIV3 vaccination among children ≤60 months 
in our cohort was not cost-effective in the introductory year (2012 season; 
24,450 USD/QALY gained), highly cost-effective in the 2013 season (554 USD/QALY 
gained), and cost-effective in the 2014 season (16,200 USD/QALY gained).
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of IIV3 vaccination among children 
participating in the cohort study varied by influenza season, with vaccine cost 
and proportion of high-risk children demonstrating the greatest influence in 
sensitivity analyses. Vaccinating children against influenza can be economically 
favorable depending on the maturity of the program, influenza vaccine 
performance, and target population.

BACKGROUND: The JEVIN trial started as a cross-sectional study in 1989/90 in 
Jena. After a follow-up of more than 20 years, the mortality incidence of JEVIN 
participants with type 1 diabetes was surveyed.
METHODS: 103 (78.6%) of the 131 JEVIN patients participating at baseline could 
be examined. 38 persons (36.9%) had deceased. All JEVIN survey data and routine 
examinations documented in the electronic patient record EMIL® of surviving and 
deceased participants were used for analyses. We compared the data of the 
surviving with the deceased participants (follow-up time: 2,166 person-years).
RESULTS: The incidence rate of death was 1.75/100 person-years. Median 
observation time for all patients was 23.1 years (range 0.61-26.6 years). Mean 
age at death was 58.5 years (34.2-78.4 years), and diabetes duration 35 years 
(3.5-68.5 years). Most frequent causes of death were: cardiovascular diseases 
(48.2%, n=13) and infections (25.9%, n=7). There were no differences in age 
(p=0.302), diabetes duration (p=0.371), BMI (p=0.535), blood pressure 
(p=0.622/0.820), gender (p=0.566), and smoking status (p=0.709) between 
surviving and deceased persons. The mean HbA1c of the last year before death or 
last visit was higher in the deceased than surviving persons (7.5% vs. 7.0%; 
p=0.010). 57.4% of the surviving and 87.0% of the deceased participants had 
nephropathy (p=0.012), 79.7% vs. 89.7% retinopathy (p=0.241) and 61.4% vs. 63.3% 
neuropathy (p=0.860), but only nephropathy was significantly associated with 
increased mortality risk (HR=4.208, CI:1.226-14.440; HR=2.360, CI:0.696-8.004; 
HR=0.944, CI:0.436-2.043).
CONCLUSIONS: In the JEVIN population with diabetes mellitus type 1 only, 
diabetic nephropathy was associated with higher mortality risk.

AIMS: The long-term life expectancy and fate of the leg, including progression 
rate to critical limb ischaemia (CLI), were analysed in de novo patients with 
intermittent claudication (IC).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort study was performed in 1107 patients 
with de novo IC. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), freedom from major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), freedom from major adverse cardiovascular 
and limb events (MACLE), and fate of the leg. The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year 
rates were 73.3, 47.8, 28.1, and 14.9% for OS, and 63.0, 35.6, 18.5, and 5.7% 
for freedom from MACE, respectively. In Cox multivariable analysis, body mass 
index, diabetes, haemodialysis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were 
correlated with OS (P < 0.05). Ankle brachial pressure index, diabetes, coronary 
artery disease, haemodialysis, and CRP level were independently correlated with 
freedom from MACE and MACLE. Statins improved mortality, MACE, and MACLE 
(P < 0.05). Revascularization did not improve mortality and MACE, and 
femoropopliteal revascularization increased MACLE (P < 0.05). There was no 
deterioration of claudication in 881 patients (79.6%). Worsening claudication 
was noted in 211 patients (14.8% per 5 years), and 15 patients (1.1% per 5 
years) worsened to CLI. Diabetes and haemodialysis were independent predictors 
of CLI. A history of cerebral infarction and femoropopliteal revascularization 
tended to increase CLI.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in patients with IC was poor, but the rate of IC 
progression to CLI was low. Statins improved mortality and morbidity, 
revascularization did not improve mortality and MACE, and femoropopliteal 
revascularization reduced freedom from MACLE with a risk of CLI.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due to the long life expectancy after treatment, the 
risk of late effects after radiotherapy (RT) is of particular importance for 
patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Both deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) 
and proton therapy have been shown to reduce the dose to normal tissues for 
mediastinal HL, but the impact of these techniques in combination is unknown. 
The purpose of this study was to compare the life years lost (LYL) attributable 
to late effects after RT for mediastinal HL using intensity modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT) in free breathing (FB) and DIBH, and proton therapy in FB and 
DIBH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plans for each technique were created for 22 patients 
with HL. Doses were extracted and the risk of late effects and LYL were 
estimated.
RESULTS: We found that the use of DIBH, proton therapy, and the combination 
significantly reduced the LYL compared to IMRT in FB. The lowest LYL was found 
for proton therapy in DIBH. However, when IMRT in DIBH was compared to proton 
therapy in FB, no significant difference was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific plan comparisons should be used to select the 
optimal technique when comparing IMRT in DIBH and proton therapy in FB.

There is uncertainty regarding whether patients with cancer should be screened 
for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We performed a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to estimate the relative incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in 
cancer.We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published before December 21, 
2016. We included studies that evaluated the incidence of TB in patients with 
solid cancers and haematological malignancies relative to a reference group 
(study control or general population). A pooled estimate of the incidence rate 
ratio (IRR) was obtained using standard meta-analysis methods.The search 
strategy identified 13 unique studies including 921 464 patients with cancer. 
The IRR of TB for adult patients with cancer was 2.61 (95% CI 2.12-3.22; 
I2=91%). In haematological cancers, the IRR was 3.53 (95% CI 1.63-7.64; I2=96%); 
and in solid cancers in adults, it was 2.25 (95% CI 1.96-2.58; I2=91%). The 
highest IRR was found in children with haematological malignancies or solid 
cancers (IRR 16.82, 95% CI 8.81-32.12; I2=79%).Considering the limited duration 
of maximum immunosuppression in cancer and reduced cumulative lifetime risk of 
TB because of reduced life expectancy, children, but not adults, appear to be at 
a sufficient level of risk to warrant systematic screening for LTBI.

Liver transplantation (LT) is the gold standard treatment for end-stage liver 
disease. Whatever the primary indication of LT, substance abuse after surgery 
may decrease survival rates and quality of life. Prevalence of severe alcohol 
relapse is between 11 and 26%, and reduces life expectancy regardless of the 
primary indication of LT. Many patients on waiting lists for LT are smokers and 
this is a major risk factor for both malignant tumors and cardiovascular events 
post-surgery. The aim of this review is to describe psychoactive substance 
consumption after LT, and to assess the impact on liver transplant recipients. 
This review describes data about alcohol and illicit drug use by transplant 
recipients and suggests guidelines for behavior management after surgery. The 
presence of an addiction specialist in a LT team seems to be very important.

OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal conditions requiring surgical intervention are 
becoming increasingly frequent in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) as life 
expectancy increases. In addition, patients with CF are at risk of specific 
gastrointestinal complications associated with their disease. This includes 
distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), which may affect up to 15% of 
patients, and can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The aim of this 
study was to determine the nature and frequency of general surgical procedures 
undertaken in a large cohort of adult CF patients so as to guide future care.
DESIGN: The medical records of all surviving adult CF patients followed at a 
large tertiary referral centre in the UK were scrutinised and details retrieved 
on those who had undergone abdominal surgery after the age of 16 years.
RESULTS: A total of 377 patients with CF were identified from the prospectively 
held database. Thirty-three patients had undergone 43 abdominal operations. The 
median age at surgery was 22.7 years (range 16-58 years). The three most 
commonly performed operations were: surgery for DIOS (n=9); cholecystectomy 
(n=8) and fundoplication (n=6). A past history of surgically treated meconium 
ileus at birth was a significant risk factor for requiring surgery for DIOS as 
an adult.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of DIOS-related complications is one of the main 
reasons for abdominal surgery in the adult CF population. The general surgical 
community needs to be increasingly aware of the existence of disease-related 
gastrointestinal conditions in adult CF patients so that treatment can be 
optimised.

INTRODUCTION: Conventional endoscopic duct clearance may not be possible in up 
to 10%-15% of common bile duct stones (CBDS). Sphincterotomy and biliary 
drainage by endoprosthesis have for many years been the mainstay of management 
in irretrievable stones. Recent years have seen the advent of sphincteroplasty 
or cholangioscopically-guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) permitting duct 
clearance in majority of cases. However, when bile duct clearance is not 
possible, options include long-term stenting followed by elective stent exchange 
(ESE) 6-12 monthly or permanent stent insertion (PSI) in selected cases, but it 
is not clear which management strategy among ESE and PSI is preferable.
METHODS AND AIMS: A retrospective review of all patients in Leeds Teaching 
Hospitals NHS Trust who underwent plastic stent insertion for biliary access for 
difficult CBDS from January 2006 to December 2011 was undertaken. Adult patients 
with irretrievable CBDS who had plastic stent insertions throughout the 
follow-up period were included. Patients who underwent PSI and ESE annually were 
retrospectively reviewed to determine the long-term outcomes. A detailed 
systematic review was also performed, examining the outcomes of CBDS managed 
with stents.
RESULTS: During the study period, 674 patients underwent 1769 
biliary-stent-related procedures; of which, 246 patients met our inclusion 
criteria. 201 patients had subsequent duct clearance. 45 patients were, 
therefore, included in the final analysis, 28 of whom underwent annual ESEs and 
17 PSIs. Patients in the PSI group had higher American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores compared with the ESE group. In the PSI group, 
9/17 patients presented acutely with blocked stents, 5 of whom presented within 
12 months. 2/9 patients were severely ill and died within a fortnight following 
the repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In the ESE 
group, 4/28 patients had duct clearance in subsequent ERCPs, 1/28 patient 
presented with a blocked stent, and no biliary-related deaths were observed. The 
mean numbers of ERCPs performed were 0.52 and 1.95 in the PSI and ESE groups, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 50% of patients treated with long-term stenting re-presented 
acutely with stent blockage, though many of these were before 12 months, meaning 
planned stent exchange would not have affected the outcome. Duct clearance using 
all possible modalities is the preferred option, but where not possible, 
management with biliary stenting either with elective exchange or permanent 
stenting remains a possibility for carefully selected patients, though maybe 
best suited to those with limited life expectancy.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous, mostly age-associated group of 
disorders characterized by progressive neuronal loss, the most prevalent being 
Alzheimer disease. It is anticipated that, with continuously increasing life 
expectancy, these diseases will pose a serious social and health problem in the 
near feature. Meanwhile, however, their etiology remains largely obscure even 
though all possible novel clues are being thoroughly examined. In this regard, a 
concept has been proposed that p53, as a transcription factor controlling many 
vital cellular pathways including apoptosis, may contribute to neuronal death 
common to all neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, we review the research 
devoted to the possible role of p53 in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We 
not only describe aberrant changes in p53 level/activity observed in CNS regions 
affected by particular diseases but, most importantly, put special attention to 
the complicated reciprocal regulatory ties existing between p53 and proteins 
commonly regarded as pathological hallmarks of these diseases, with the ultimate 
goal to identify the primary element of their pathogenesis.

AIMS: To develop a health economic model to evaluate the long-term costs and 
outcomes over the healthcare treatment pathway for patients with low back pain 
(LBP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A health economic model, consisting of a decision tree 
structure with a Markov microsimulation model at the end of each branch, was 
created. Patients were followed from first observed clinical presentation with 
LBP until the age of 100 years or death. The underlying data to populate the 
model were based on Swedish national and regional registry data on healthcare 
resource use and sickness insurance in patients presenting with LBP in the 
Swedish region Västra Götaland during 2008-2012. Costs (outpatient healthcare 
visits, inpatient bed days, pharmaceuticals, productivity loss), EUR 2016, and 
quality-of-life based on EQ-5D data from the registries and published estimates 
were summarized over the lifetime of the patients with 3% annual discount. A 
lost quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was valued at €70,000.
RESULTS: Mean lifetime total cost was estimated at €47,452/patient, of which 
indirect costs were 57%. Total lifetime economic burden for all patients coming 
to clinical presentation in Sweden per year was €8.8bn. The average LBP patient 
was estimated to face a loss of 2.7 QALYs over their lifetime compared with the 
general population. For all patients in Sweden coming to clinical presentation 
in 1 year this gives 505,407 QALYs lost, valued at €35.3bn. Adding the economic 
burden, the total societal burden amounts to €44.1bn.
CONCLUSION: This pathway model shows that most patients with LBP receive 
conservative care, and a minority consume high-cost healthcare interventions 
like surgery. The model could be used to see broad economic effects of different 
patterns of healthcare provision in sub-groups with LBP and to estimate where it 
is possible to influence these pathways to increase utility for patients and for 
society.

Effect of static and dynamic muscle stretching as part of warm up procedures on 
knee joint proprioception and strength.

Oxford Brookes University, UK. Electronic address: gwalsh@brookes.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: The importance of warm up procedures prior to athletic performance 
is well established. A common component of such procedures is muscle stretching. 
There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of static stretching (SS) as 
part of warm up procedures on knee joint position sense (KJPS) and the effect of 
dynamic stretching (DS) on KJPS is currently unknown. The aim of this study was 
to determine the effect of dynamic and static stretching as part warm up 
procedures on KJPS and knee extension and flexion strength.
METHODS: This study had a randomised cross-over design and ten healthy adults 
(20±1years) attended 3 visits during which baseline KJPS, at target angles of 
20° and 45°, and knee extension and flexion strength tests were followed by 
15min of cycling and either a rest period (CON), SS, or DS and repeat KJPS and 
strength tests. All participants performed all conditions, one condition per 
visit.
RESULTS: There were warm up×stretching type interactions for KJPS at 20° 
(p=0.024) and 45° (p=0.018), and knee flexion (p=0.002) and extension (p<0.001) 
strength. The SS and DS improved KJPS but CON condition did not and SS decreased 
strength. No change in strength was present for DS or CON.
CONCLUSIONS: Both SS and DS improve KJPS as part of pre-exercise warm up 
procedures. However, the negative impact of SS on muscle strength limits the 
utility of SS before athletic performance. If stretching is to be performed as 
part of a warm up, DS should be favoured over SS.

Since physiological and pathological processes occur at nano-environments, 
nanotechnology has considered as an efficient tool for designing of next 
generation specific biomolecules with enhanced pharmacodynamic and 
pharmacodynamic properties. In the current investigation, by control of the size 
and hydrodynamic volume at the nanoscale, for the first time, physicochemical 
and pharmacokinetic properties of an anti-VEGFA nanobody was remarkably improved 
by attachment of a Proline-Alanine-Serine (PAS) rich sequence. The results 
elucidated unexpected impressive effects of PAS sequence on physicochemical 
properties especially on size, hydrodynamics radius, and even solubility of 
nanobody. CD analysis revealed an increment in random coil structure of the 
PASylated protein in comparison to native one without any change in charge state 
or binding kinetic parameters of nanobody assessed by isoelectric focusing and 
surface plasmon resonance measurements, respectively. In vitro biological 
activities of nanobody were not affected by coupling of the PAS sequence. In 
contrast, the terminal half-life was significantly increased by a factor of 14 
for the nanobody-PAS after single dose IV injection to the mice. Our study 
demonstrated that the control of size in the design of small therapeutic 
proteins has a promising effect on the stability and solubility, in addition to 
their physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The designed new anti-VEGFA 
nanobody could promise a better therapeutic agent with a long administration 
intervals and lower dose, which in turn leads to a better patient compliance. 
Size adjustment of an anti-VEGF nanobody at the nanoscale by the attachment of a 
natural PAS polymer remarkably improves physicochemical properties, as well as a 
pharmacokinetic profile without any change in biological activity of the 
miniaturized antibody.

Heart failure causes significant health and financial burdens for patients and 
society. Multidisciplinary management program (MMP) and exercise training 
program (ETP) have been reported as cost-effective in improving health outcomes, 
yet no study has compared the 2 programs. We constructed a Markov model to 
simulate life year (LY) gained and total costs in usual care (UC), MMP, and ETP. 
The probability of transitions between states and healthcare costs were 
extracted from previous literature. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a 10-year horizon. Model robustness was 
assessed through 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The expected LY 
for patients treated with UC, MMP, and ETP was 7.6, 8.2, and 8.4 years, 
respectively. From a societal perspective, the expected cost of MMP was $20,695, 
slightly higher than the cost of UC ($20,092). The cost of ETP was much higher 
($48,378) because of its high implementation expense and the wage loss it 
incurred. The ICER of MMP versus UC was $976 per LY gained, and the ICER of ETP 
versus MMP was $165,702 per LY gained. The results indicated that, under current 
cost-effectiveness threshold, MMP is cost-effective compared with UC, and ETP is 
not cost-effective compared with MMP. However, ETP is cost-effective compared 
with MMP from a healthcare payer's perspective.

Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella 
pertussis Despite widespread vaccination, its incidence has been rising 
alarmingly, and yet, the physiology of B. pertussis remains poorly understood. 
We combined genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, a novel optimization 
algorithm, and experimental data to probe the full metabolic potential of this 
pathogen, using B. pertussis strain Tohama I as a reference. Experimental 
validation showed that B. pertussis secretes a significant proportion of 
nitrogen as arginine and purine nucleosides, which may contribute to modulation 
of the host response. We also found that B. pertussis can be unexpectedly 
versatile, being able to metabolize many compounds while displaying minimal 
nutrient requirements. It can grow without cysteine, using inorganic sulfur 
sources, such as thiosulfate, and it can grow on organic acids, such as citrate 
or lactate, as sole carbon sources, providing in vivo demonstration that its 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is functional. Although the metabolic 
reconstruction of eight additional strains indicates that the structural genes 
underlying this metabolic flexibility are widespread, experimental validation 
suggests a role of strain-specific regulatory mechanisms in shaping metabolic 
capabilities. Among five alternative strains tested, three strains were shown to 
grow on substrate combinations requiring a functional TCA cycle, but only one 
strain could use thiosulfate. Finally, the metabolic model was used to 
rationally design growth media with >2-fold improvements in pertussis toxin 
production. This study thus provides novel insights into B. pertussis physiology 
and highlights the potential, but also the limitations, of models based solely 
on metabolic gene content.IMPORTANCE The metabolic capabilities of Bordetella 
pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, were investigated from a 
systems-level perspective. We constructed a comprehensive genome-scale metabolic 
model for B. pertussis and challenged its predictions experimentally. This 
systems approach shed light on new potential host-microbe interactions and 
allowed us to rationally design novel growth media with >2-fold improvements in 
pertussis toxin production. Most importantly, we also uncovered the potential 
for metabolic flexibility of B. pertussis (significantly larger range of 
substrates than previously alleged; novel active pathways allowing growth in 
minimal, nearly mineral nutrient combinations where only the carbon source must 
be organic), although our results also highlight the importance of 
strain-specific regulatory determinants in shaping metabolic capabilities. 
Deciphering the underlying regulatory mechanisms appears to be crucial for a 
comprehensive understanding of B. pertussis's lifestyle and the epidemiology of 
whooping cough. The contribution of metabolic models in this context will 
require the extension of the genome-scale metabolic model to integrate this 
regulatory dimension.

In the last years, epigenetic regulation of gene expression is regarded as an 
important factor involved in a broad spectrum of aging-associated processes 
including loss of physical activity, frailty and genomic instability, and in 
development of various pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, type 2 
diabetes, cancer, immune deficits and neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, 
inhibitors of the members of superfamilies of histone deacetylases (HDACs) have 
been proposed, among other drugs targeting epigenetic pathways, as a promising 
type of therapeutics that is able to combat aging and its manifestations. The 
main focus of this article is a review of the literature describing the 
healthspan-promoting and life-extending effects of inhibitors of HDAC activity 
in both animal and clinical studies.
