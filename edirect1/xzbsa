This study evaluated the effects of Zataria multiflora essential oil (EO) and 
nisin on fresh rainbow trout fillets during storage at 4 °C. Treatments included 
the following: A (control samples without EO and nisin), E1 (treated samples 
with 0.2% EO), E2 (treated samples with 0.4% EO), N (treated samples with 150 IU 
nisin/g), E1N (treated samples with 0.2% EO and nisin) and E2N (treated samples 
with 0.4% EO and nisin). Chemical and oxidation changes were investigated in 
this study as the functions of treatment and storage time. E1N and E2N had 
better effects on oxidation changes and maintaining values of peroxide value and 
thiobarbituric acid than A, E1, E2 and N treatments. Lower total volatile base 
nitrogen was found in E2N than in other treatments during storage time.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) appears to be increasing rapidly, threatening to reduce 
life expectancy for humans around the globe. The International Diabetes 
Federation (IDF) has estimated that there will be 642 million people living with 
the disease by 2040 and half as many again who will be not diagnosed. This means 
that pre-DM screening is a critical issue. Insulin resistance (IR) has emerged 
as a major pathophysiological factor in the development and progression of DM 
since it is evident in susceptible individuals at the early stages of DM, and 
particularly type 2 DM (T2DM). Therefore, assessment of IR via the homeostasis 
model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) is a key index for the primary prevention of DM 
and is thus found in guidelines for screening of high-risk groups. However, the 
cut-off values of HOMA-IR differ for different races, ages, genders, diseases, 
complications, etc. due to the complexity of IR. This hampers the determination 
of specific cut-off values of HOMA-IR in different places and in different 
situations. China has not published an official index to gauge IR for primary 
prevention of T2DM in the diabetic and non-diabetic population except for 
children and adolescents ages 6-12 years. Hence, this article summarizes 
developments in research on IR, HOMA-IR, and pre-DM screening in order to 
provide a reference for optimal cut-off values of HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of 
DM in the Chinese population.

The infection cycle of filamentous fungi consists of two main stages: invasion 
(growth) and dispersion (development). After the deposition of a spore on a 
host, germination, polar extension and branching of vegetative cells called 
hyphae allow a fast and efficient invasion. Under suboptimal conditions, genetic 
reprogramming of hyphae results in the generation of asexual spores, allowing 
dissemination to new hosts and the beginning of a new infection cycle. In the 
model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, asexual development or 
conidiation is induced by the upstream developmental activation (UDA) pathway. 
UDA proteins transduce signals from the tip, the polarity site of hyphae, to 
nuclei, where developmental programs are transcriptionally activated. The 
present review summarizes the current knowledge on this tip-to-nucleus 
communication mechanism, emphasizing its dependence on hyphal polarity. Future 
approaches to the topic will also be suggested, as stimulating elements 
contributing to the understanding of how apical signals are coupled with the 
transcriptional control of development and pathogenesis in filamentous fungi.

In the United States, the health of a community falls on a continuum ranging 
from healthy to unhealthy and fluctuates based on several variables. Research 
policy and public health practice literature report substantial disparities in 
life expectancy, morbidity, risk factors, and quality of life, as well as 
persistence of these disparities among segments of the population. One such way 
to close this gap is to streamline medical education to better prepare our 
future physicians for our patients in underserved communities. Medical schools 
have the potential to close the gap when training future physicians by providing 
them with the principles of social medicine that can contribute to the reduction 
of health disparities. Curriculum reform and systematic formative assessment and 
evaluative measures can be developed to match social medicine and health 
disparities curricula for individual medical schools, thus assuring that future 
physicians are being properly prepared for residency and the workforce to 
decrease health inequities in the United States. We propose that curriculum 
reform includes an ongoing social medicine component for medical students. 
Continued exposure, practice, and education related to social medicine across 
medical school will enhance the awareness and knowledge for our students. This 
will result in better preparation for the zero mile stone residency set forth by 
the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education and will eventually lead 
to the outcome of higher quality physicians in the United States to treat 
diverse populations.

The aim of our analysis was to compare the cost-effectiveness of high-dose 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hypofractionated 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (HF-IMRT) versus conventional dose 
three-dimensional radiation therapy (3DCRT) for the treatment of localised 
prostate cancer. A Markov model was constructed to calculate the incremental 
quality-adjusted life years and costs. Transition probabilities, adverse events 
and utilities were derived from relevant systematic reviews. Microcosting in a 
large university hospital was applied to calculate cost vectors. The expected 
mean lifetime cost of patients undergoing 3DCRT, IMRT and HF-IMRT were 7,160 
euros, 6,831 euros and 6,019 euros respectively. The expected quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) were 5.753 for 3DCRT, 5.956 for IMRT and 5.957 for HF-IMRT. 
Compared to 3DCRT, both IMRT and HF-IMRT resulted in more health gains at a 
lower cost. It can be concluded that high-dose IMRT is not only cost-effective 
compared to the conventional dose 3DCRT but, when used with a hypofractionation 
scheme, it has great cost-saving potential for the public payer and may improve 
access to radiation therapy for patients.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative predictive power of handgrip and leg 
extension strength in predicting slow walking.
DESIGN: Report of correlative analysis from two epidemiological cohort studies.
SETTING: Foundation of the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.
PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 67 to 93 (N=6,766).
MEASUREMENTS: Leg strength, handgrip strength, and gait speed were measured. 
Strength cutpoints associated with slow gait speed were developed using 
classification and regression tree analyses and compared using ordinary least 
squares regression models.
RESULTS: The cutpoints of lower extremity strength associated with slow gait 
speed were 154.6 N-m in men and 89.9 N-m in women for isometric leg extension 
strength and 94.5 N-m in men and 62.3 N-m in women for isokinetic leg extension 
strength. Weakness defined according to handgrip strength (odds ratios (OR)=1.99 
to 4.33, c-statistics=0.53 to 0.67) or leg strength (ORs=2.52 to 5.77; 
c-statistics=0.61 to 0.66) was strongly related to odds of slow gait speed. 
Lower extremity strength contributed 1% to 16% of the variance and handgrip 
strength contributed 3% to 17% of the variance in the prediction of gait speed 
depending on sex and mode of strength assessment.
CONCLUSION: Muscle weakness of the leg extensors and forearm flexors is related 
to slow gait speed. Leg extension strength is only a slightly better predictor 
of slow gait speed. Thus, handgrip and leg extension strength appear to be 
suitable for screening for muscle weakness in older adults.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of ladder-related falls is increasing, and this 
represents a disturbing trend, particularly in the context of increased life 
expectancy and the impending retirement of the populous 'baby-boomer' 
generation. To date, there have been no critical illness-focused studies 
reporting on the incidence, severity and outcomes of severe ladder-related 
injuries requiring ICU management.
METHODS: Major trauma patients admitted to ICU over a 5year period to June 2011 
after ladder falls >1m were identified from prospectively collected trauma data 
at a Level 1 trauma service. Demographic and ICU clinical management data were 
collected and non-parametric statistical analyses were used to explore the 
relationships between variables in hospital mortality/survival.
RESULTS: There were 584 ladder fall admissions, including 194 major trauma 
cases, of whom 29.9% (n=58) fell >1m and were admitted to ICU. Hospital 
mortality was 26%, and fatal cases were almost entirely older males in domestic 
falls of ≤3m who died as a result of traumatic brain injury. Non-survivors had 
lower GCS at the scene (p=0.02), higher AIS head code (p=0.01), higher heart 
rate and lower mean arterial pressure (p<0.01) in the initial 24h period in ICU, 
and were ≥55years of age (p=0.05). Only 46% of patients available for follow-up 
were living at home at 12months without requiring additional care.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ladder falls requiring ICU management is 
increasing, and severe traumatic brain injury was responsible for the majority 
of deaths and for poor outcomes in survivors. In-hospital costs attributable to 
the care of these patients are high, and fewer than half were living 
independently at home at 12months post-fall. A concerted public health campaign 
is required to alert the community to the potential consequences of this 
mechanism of injury. The use of helmets for ladder users in domestic settings, 
where occupational health and safety regulations are less likely to be applied, 
is strongly recommended to mitigate the risk of severe brain injury. The 
benefits of this simple strategy far outweigh any mild inconvenience for the 
wearer, and may prevent catastrophic injury.

AIMS: Poorer outcomes in those aged ≥80 years who undergo colorectal cancer 
surgery have been previously reported. Little is known about the natural history 
of those managed non-operatively. We explored outcomes in all patients with 
colorectal cancer aged ≥80 years at time of diagnosis based on treatment 
received.
METHODS: Patients ≥80 years diagnosed with colorectal cancer in one hospital 
trust between 1998 and 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained 
database. Primary endpoints were age at diagnosis, age at death/censor and 
mortality at 30, 90 and 365 days.
RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-eight patients were identified. Four hundred twelve 
(61.7%) underwent surgery, 44 (6.6%) received endoscopic therapy and 212 (31.7%) 
had no active treatment. Of those who underwent surgery, 359 (87.1%) had 
resectional surgery, 34 (8.3%) defunctioning only, 13 (3.2%) received bypass 
surgery and 6 (1.5%) had an open and close laparotomy. The mean age at diagnosis 
was younger in those who underwent surgical resection (83.7 years) compared to 
those having defunctioning surgery (84.9 years, P = 0.043), endoscopic therapy 
(85.1 years, P = 0.008) or no surgical intervention (85.6 years, P < 0.001). 
There was no significant difference in the mean age of death or censor between 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in age at death or censor 
between treatment groups among patients aged ≥80 years presenting with 
colorectal cancer, suggesting that differences in the observed survival time are 
heavily influenced by lead time bias. Age at death or censor should be reported 
in addition to survival times in this age group to enable fair comparison of 
outcomes.

Sociosanitaria, Politiche Sociali e Famiglia, Regione Autonoma Friuli Venezia 
Giulia, Udine, Italy.

BACKGROUND: The number of years of life lost (YLL) in a population depends not 
only on the number of deaths but also on the age at which the deaths have 
occurred, and, as a measure of the burden of premature mortality, is an 
important piece of information for public health professionals.
METHODS: We calculated YLL in the population of Friuli Venezia Giulia, a 1 200 
000 inhabitant Italian region, in 2013 and the trend in the past 14 years, 
through a population-based study using the regional mortality database as the 
source of information. The same projected life expectancy estimates for 2050 
were used for calculating YLL both in males and females, for each calendar year.
RESULTS: In 2013, we counted 14 080 deaths and estimated 220 961 YLL. Malignant 
neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases accounted for the greatest number of YLL. 
Injuries had the highest number of YLL per death. Overall, YLL decreased from 
2000 to 2013, but differences were observed for different causes of death. 
Cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and unintentional injuries showed a decreasing 
trend, whereas infectious diseases resulted increasing over time.
CONCLUSION: This study, estimating the relative impact of different conditions 
on the society though the YLL, is a relevant input for the regional public 
health agenda.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is 
an approved treatment for select patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Data 
indicate r-tPA improves functional outcome three months after AIS compared with 
placebo. This study models the increase in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
associated with r-tPA compared with similar patients not treated with r-tPA.
METHODS: Hospital discharge data for AIS and r-tPA were obtained from the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2011. Discharge location (home, 
rehabilitation, long-term care, death) was mapped to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 
scores based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) 
Study Group Part 1 and 2 clinical studies. The mRS scores were mapped to 
relative risk of death and QALYs obtained from the literature. The model 
estimated expected survival and QALYs by age, gender and mRS for patients 
receiving r-tPA. Life expectancy and QALYs for patients not receiving r-tPA were 
estimated based on discharge location and mRS for placebo patients in the NINDS 
study.
RESULTS: AIS discharges declined from over 635,000 in 1998 to over 593,000 in 
2011. A total of 183,235 patients received r-tPA. Utilization of r-tPA increased 
from 1% of AIS patients in 1998 to over 4% in 2011. Estimated projections for 
QALYs gained from utilization of r-tPA to QALYS without r-tPA were just under 
240,000 for the 13 years and with no discounting, and just over 165,000 assuming 
3% annual discounting. In the most conservative scenario, assuming no difference 
in proportional discharge status (i.e. patients not treated with r-tPA are 
discharged in the same manner as r-tPA patients), the estimated life years 
gained are approximately 35,000 and QALYS gained are approximately 90,000.
CONCLUSIONS: r-tPA for AIS has resulted in estimated gains in quality-adjusted 
life years due to reduction in disability and improvement in functioning since 
its introduction in 1998.

    Transplantation. 2016 Apr;100(4):708-9.

BACKGROUND: In December 2014, a new national deceased donor kidney allocation 
policy was implemented, which allocates kidneys in the top 20% of the kidney 
donor profile index to candidates in the top 20% of expected survival. We 
examined the cost implications of this policy change.
METHODS: A Markov model was applied to estimate differences in total lifetime 
cost of care and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: Under the old allocation policy, average lifetime outcomes per listed 
patient discounted to 2012 US dollars were US $342,799 and 5.42 QALY, yielding 
US $63,775 per QALY gained. Under the new policy, average lifetime cost was 
reduced by US $2090 and lifetime QALYs increased by 0.03. Thus, the new policy 
improved on the old policy by producing more QALYs at lower cost. The present 
value of total lifetime cost savings from the policy change is estimated to be 
US $271 million in the first year and US $55 million in subsequent years. The 
higher transplant rates and allograft survival expected for candidates in the 
top 20% of expected survival would decrease costs by reducing time on dialysis. 
Most cost savings are expected to accrue to Medicare, and most increased access 
to transplant is expected in private payer populations.
CONCLUSIONS: The new allocation policy was found to be dominant over the old 
policy because it increases QALYs at lower cost.

Over the last few decades, multiple biological properties, providing 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive and anti-cancer benefits, as 
well as the characteristic pungent and bitter taste, have been attributed to 
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) phenols. In particular, growing efforts have been 
devoted to the study of the antioxidants of EVOO, due to their importance from 
health, biological and sensory points of view. Hydrophilic and lipophilic 
phenols represent the main antioxidants of EVOO, and they include a large 
variety of compounds. Among them, the most concentrated phenols are lignans and 
secoiridoids, with the latter found exclusively in the Oleaceae family, of which 
the drupe is the only edible fruit. In recent years, therefore, we have tackled 
the study of the main properties of phenols, including the relationships between 
their biological activity and the related chemical structure. This review, in 
fact, focuses on the phenolic compounds of EVOO, and, in particular, on their 
biological properties, sensory aspects and antioxidant capacity, with a 
particular emphasis on the extension of the product shelf-life.

Bone loss during aging has become an increasing public health concern as average 
life expectancy has increased. One of the most prevalent forms of age-related 
bone disease today is osteoporosis in which the body slows down bone formation 
and existing bone is increasingly being resorbed by the body to maintain the 
calcium balance. Some causes of this bone loss can be attributed to 
dysregulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity mediated by increased 
oxidative stress through the aging process. Due to certain serious adverse 
effects of the currently available therapeutic agents that limit their efficacy, 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has garnered interest as a natural 
means for the prevention of this debilitating disease. Natural antioxidant 
supplementation, a type of CAM, has been researched to aid in reducing bone loss 
caused by oxidative stress. Naturally occurring polyphenols, such as 
anthocyanins rich in berries, are known to have anti-oxidative properties. 
Several studies have been reviewed to determine the impact polyphenol 
intake-particularly that of berries-has on bone health. Studies reveal a 
positive association of high berry intake and higher bone mass, implicating 
berries as possible inexpensive alternatives in reducing the risk of age related 
bone loss.

The Syrian crisis, now in its fifth year, has created an unprecedented strain on 
health services and systems due to the protracted nature of the warfare, the 
targeting of medics and health care infrastructure, the exodus of physicians and 
nurses, the shortage of medical supplies and medications, and the disruption of 
medical education and training. Within a few short years, the life expectancy of 
resident Syrians has declined by 20 years. Over the first 4 years of the 
conflict, more than 75,000 civilians died from injuries incurred in the 
violence. More than twice as many civilians, including many women and children, 
have died prematurely of infectious and noninfectious chronic diseases for want 
of adequate health care. Doctors, local administrators, and nongovernmental 
organizations are struggling to manage the consequences of the conflict under 
substandard conditions, often using unorthodox methods of health care delivery 
in field hospitals and remotely by telehealth communication. Much-needed medical 
supplies are channeled through dangerous routes across the borders from Lebanon, 
Jordan, and Turkey. Physicians in the United States and other western nations 
have helped Syrian physicians make the most of the situation by providing 
training on introducing innovations in technology and treatment. Portable 
ultrasound machines have been introduced and are being used extensively in the 
management of trauma and shock. This report, prepared by members of the Syrian 
American Medical Society, documents current needs for health care relief within 
Syria, focusing on pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine, and some of the 
efforts currently underway to meet those needs.

[Economic evaluation seeks threshold to support decision-making].

[Article in Spanish]

Valcárcel-Nazco C, Serrano Aguilar P.

To incorporate economic evaluation into decision-making, we need to know how 
much a health system is willing and able to invest in a quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY). In Spain, the figure of 30,000 per QALY as cost-effectiveness (CE) 
threshold has been widely cited. However, as in most health systems, no value 
has been formally adopted; mainly because of the arbitrariness, the lack of 
theoretical and scientific basis, and the controversy around its estimation and 
what the threshold should represent. Based on a systematic review of empirical 
studies on the estimation of the CE threshold undertaken by this research team, 
we conducted a critical appraisal of the state of the art, using a Delphi with 
the participation of 13 national experts. This paper contributes to assess the 
research progress on the CE threshold in Spain, to consider its utility in the 
decision making process supported by economic evaluation, and to propose further 
research to improve what has been achieved so far.

OBJECTIVE: Suboptimal adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICs) is an important 
cause of poor asthma control in pediatric patients. Among the factors that can 
be most easily changed for enhancing adherence to ICs is a reduction in the 
dosing frequency, from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing. However, no 
previous studies have reported an economic evaluation comparing once-daily 
versus twice-daily IC dosing for pediatric asthma. The aim of this study was to 
compare the cost-effectiveness of once-daily versus twice-daily IC dosing for 
maintenance treatment of asthma in pediatric patients.
METHODS: A Markov-type model was developed in order to estimate costs and health 
outcomes of a simulated cohort of pediatric patients with persistent asthma 
treated over a 12-month period. Effectiveness parameters were obtained from a 
systematic review of the literature. Cost data were obtained from official 
databases provided by the Colombian Ministry of Health. The main outcome was the 
variable "quality-adjusted life-years" (QALYs).
RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the model showed that compared with 
twice-daily dosing, once-daily dosing strategy involved lower costs (US$1529.3 
versus $1709.1 average cost per patient over 12 months) and the greatest gain in 
QALYs (0.8284 versus 0.8084 QALYs on average per patient over 12 months), 
resulting in once-daily dosing strategy being considered dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that compared with twice-daily dosing, once-daily 
IC dosing for treating pediatric patients with persistent asthma is the dominant 
strategy because it involves a greater gain in QALYs at lower total treatment 
cost.

The present study used disability adjusted life years (DALY) to estimate the 
burden of external cause of injuries in construction workers insured in Iran in 
2012. The Global Burden of Disease method (2010) was used to estimate the years 
of life lost due to death (YLL) and years of life lost due to disability (YLD). 
DALY was calculated as the sum of YLL and YLD. There were 5352 injured 
construction workers in Iran (11.25 individuals per 1000). Falling was the most 
common incidence and included 2490 individuals (46.53%). Totally, DALY was 
estimated 18,557 years for all age groups and both genders including 17,821 YLD 
(96%) and 736 YLL (4%). The DALY related to construction work is high in Iran 
and it has notably affected the young. Hence more preventive methods should be 
applied to reduce the overall burden of specific external cause of injuries 
especially in young and inexperienced workers.

Elderly patients may be different from the average population in regard to the 
treatment of shoulder disorders. Challenges are the decreased quality of bone, 
tendons and cartilage, decreased blood perfusion and a generally aged biology. 
The advantages however are the often more realistic expectations and more 
cautious use of the extremity, and the limited life expectancy of prosthetic 
implants is a less pressing issue. Local pathologies such as in the AC-joint or 
long head of the biceps may also in the aged patient be treated with 
infiltration or arthroscopic means. If however large rotator cuff tears and 
osteoarthritis are present, (reverse) total shoulder implants are the treatment 
of choice due to the high reliability and uncomplicated rehabilitation.

Multiple myeloma: Diagnosis and management issues in patients with pre-existing 
chronic kidney disease.

Andhra Pradesh, India.

Multiple myeloma is one of the most common malignancies encountered in clinical 
practice. Renal involvement in myeloma is a well-recognized entity. Although 
rare, another special situation that a nephrologist can encounter is myeloma 
occurring in a patient with preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to 
other etiologies. Anemia, bone pains and hypercalcemia, which commonly indicate 
the diagnosis of myeloma in the general population, are not useful in the 
presence of CKD. The sensitivity and specificity of serum free light chain assay 
is decreased in the presence of renal failure. Chemotherapy-related adverse 
effects are high compared with that in patients without CKD; this is attributed 
to the decreased clearance of drugs and the additive effect of 
chemotherapy-related adverse effects to the complications of CKD. Autologous and 
allogenic bone marrow transplantation can be attempted in this group of patients 
with non-myeloablative-conditioning regimens. Combined bone marrow and renal 
transplantation remains a viable option in this group of patients to increase 
life expectancy and quality of life.

Lifespan of laboratory animals can be increased by genetic, pharmacological, and 
dietary interventions. Increased expression of genes involved in xenobiotic 
metabolism, together with resistance to xenobiotics, are frequent correlates of 
lifespan extension in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly 
Drosophila, and mice. The Green Theory of Aging suggests that this association 
is causal, with the ability of cells to rid themselves of lipophilic toxins 
limiting normal lifespan. To test this idea, we experimentally increased 
resistance of Drosophila to the xenobiotic dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan (DDT), 
by artificial selection or by transgenic expression of a gene encoding a 
cytochrome P450. Although both interventions increased DDT resistance, neither 
increased lifespan. Furthermore, dietary restriction increased lifespan without 
increasing xenobiotic resistance, confirming that the two traits can be 
uncoupled. Reduced activity of the insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway increases 
resistance to xenobiotics and extends lifespan in Drosophila, and can also 
increase longevity in C. elegans, mice, and possibly humans. We identified a 
nuclear hormone receptor, DHR96, as an essential mediator of the increased 
xenobiotic resistance of IIS mutant flies. However, the IIS mutants remained 
long-lived in the absence of DHR96 and the xenobiotic resistance that it 
conferred. Thus, in Drosophila IIS mutants, increased xenobiotic resistance and 
enhanced longevity are not causally connected. The frequent co-occurrence of the 
two traits may instead have evolved because, in nature, lowered IIS can signal 
the presence of pathogens. It will be important to determine whether enhanced 
xenobiotic metabolism is also a correlated, rather than a causal, trait in 
long-lived mice.

Gamma irradiation (0.5-2.5 kGy) in combination with low temperature (4-15 °C) 
storage was attempted to increase shelf life of ready-to-cook shredded cabbage 
wrapped in cling films. A maximum extension in shelf life of 8 days, while 
retaining the microbial and sensory quality, was obtained with an irradiation 
dose of 2 kGy and storage at 10 °C. Gamma irradiation also inhibited browning of 
shredded cabbage at their cut edges resulting in enhanced visual appeal. An 
increase in total antioxidant activity was observed with respect to DPPH and 
hydroxyl radical scavenging ability while the nitric oxide radical scavenging 
activity and ferric reducing property remained unaffected with irradiation. 
Total phenolic, flavonoid and vitamin C content remained unchanged due to 
irradiation. No significant migration of additives from cling films into 
stimulant water was observed up to a radiation dose of 2 kGy thus demonstrating 
the feasibility of such films for above applications.

Edible films and coatings have been proposed as viable alternatives for the 
preservation of fresh food such as fruit, meat, fish and cheese. They can be 
designed to contain natural antioxidants, vitamins and antimicrobials in order 
to extend shelf life of the product keeping the natural sensorial properties. 
Essential oils have been targeted as potential active principles for edible 
films and coatings given their well-recognized antioxidant, antimicrobial and
