Pineapple-peel-based chitosan film was employed to extend the shelf life of 
Indian Cottage Cheese, commonly termed "paneer" in the Indian subcontinent. 
Pineapple peel extracts (PPE) at 3 different concentrations (1-3 %) were 
incorporated into the chitosan matrix. In comparison to control samples 
(unpacked paneer), packaged paneer samples exhibited reduced weight loss, lipid 
peroxidation, and pH changes. The microbiological shelf life of paneer got 
extended till 9th day at 4 °C when packaged in chitosan-PPE films. 
Korsmeyer-Peppas's model suggested that the release of polyphenols from the 
chitosan-PPE film followed Fickian diffusion. As per sensory evaluation on a 
9-point hedonic scale, packaged paneer samples were superior in juiciness, 
texture, color, flavor, and overall acceptability compared to unpackaged paneer 
samples. As compared to the control sample (CS), the overall acceptance was 
higher for the film with 1 % pineapple peel extract (CS PPE 1), followed by 
films with 2 % and 3 % pineapple peel extracts (CS-PPE 2 and CS-PPE 3). The 
bio-accessibility study utilized the dynamic gastric model to simulate digestion 
in the upper gastrointestinal tract and revealed 40-60 % recovery rate of 
polyphenols from the chitosan-pineapple peel film.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 130 000 infants acquire HIV annually despite global 
maternal antiretroviral therapy scale-up. We evaluated the potential clinical 
impact and cost-effectiveness of offering long-acting, anti-HIV broadly 
neutralizing antibody (bNAb) prophylaxis to infants in three distinct settings.
METHODS: We simulated infants in Côte d'Ivoire, South Africa, and Zimbabwe using 
the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-Pediatric (CEPAC-P) 
model. We modeled strategies offering a three-bNAb combination in addition to 
WHO-recommended standard-of-care oral prophylaxis to infants: a) with known, 
WHO-defined high-risk HIV exposure at birth ( HR-HIVE ); b) with known HIV 
exposure at birth ( HIVE ); or c) with or without known HIV exposure ( ALL ). 
Modeled infants received 1-dose , 2-doses , or Extended (every 3 months through 
18 months) bNAb dosing. Base case model inputs included 70% bNAb efficacy 
(sensitivity analysis range: 10-100%), 3-month efficacy duration/dosing interval 
(1-6 months), and $20/dose cost ($5-$100/dose). Outcomes included pediatric HIV 
infections, life expectancy, lifetime HIV-related costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, in US$/year-of-life-saved [YLS], assuming a < 
50% GDP per capita cost-effectiveness threshold).
RESULTS: The base case model projects that bNAb strategies targeting HIVE and 
ALL infants would prevent 7-26% and 10-42% additional pediatric HIV infections, 
respectively, compared to standard-of-care alone, ranging by dosing approach. 
HIVE-Extended would be cost-effective (cost-saving compared to standard-of-care) 
in Côte d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe; ALL-Extended would be cost-effective in South 
Africa (ICER: $882/YLS). BNAb strategies targeting HR-HIVE infants would result 
in greater lifetime costs and smaller life expectancy gains than HIVE-Extended . 
Throughout most bNAb efficacies and costs evaluated in sensitivity analyses, 
targeting HIVE infants would be cost-effective in Côte d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe, 
and targeting ALL infants would be cost-effective in South Africa.
DISCUSSION: Adding long-acting bNAbs to current standard-of-care prophylaxis 
would be cost-effective, assuming plausible efficacies and costs. The 
cost-effective target population would vary by setting, largely driven by 
maternal antenatal HIV prevalence and postpartum incidence.

BACKGROUND: People in remote areas may have more difficulty accessing healthcare 
following myocardial infarction (MI) than people in metropolitan areas. We 
determined whether remoteness was associated with initial and 12-month use of 
secondary prevention medications following MI in Victoria, Australia.
METHOD: We included all people alive at least 90 days post-discharge following 
MI between July 2012 and June 2017 in Victoria, Australia (n=41,925). We 
investigated dispensing of P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12i), statins, ACE-inhibitors or 
angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs), and beta-blockers within 90 days 
post-discharge. We estimated 12-month medication use using proportion of days 
covered (PDC). Remoteness was determined using the Accessibility/Remoteness 
Index of Australia (ARIA). Data were analyzed using adjusted parametric 
regression models stratified by STEMI and NSTEMI.
RESULTS: There were 10,819 STEMI admissions and 31,106 NSTEMI admissions. 
Following adjustment across NSTEMI and STEMI, there were no medication classes 
dispensed in the 90-days post-discharge that differed in a clinically 
significant way from the least remote (ARIA=0) to the most remote (ARIA=4.8) 
areas. The largest difference for NSTEMI were ACEi/ARB, with 71%(95%CI 70-72%) 
versus 80%(76%-83%). For STEMI, it was statins with 89%(88-90%) versus 
95%(91-97%). Predicted PDC for STEMI and NSTEMI were not clinically significant 
across remoteness, with the largest difference in NSTEMI being P2Y12i with 
48%(47-50%) versus 55%(51-59%), and in STEMI it was ACEi/ARB with 68%(67-69%) 
versus 76%(70-80%).
CONCLUSION: Remoteness does not appear to be a clinically significant driver for 
medication use following MI. Possible differences in cardiovascular outcomes in 
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas are not likely to be explained by access 
to secondary prevention medications.

Plain Language Summary: We investigated how where a person lives may affect the 
use of medications required following a heart attack. Our research used 
dispensing information and hospital admission information for a population of 
41,925 heart attack admissions. Our main findings were: There were no clinically 
significant differences in initial dispensing or 12-month use of secondary 
prevention medications with respect to how remote a person may live in in 
Victoria, Australia.Our research suggests that there is equal access to 
medications with respect to remoteness, and any differences in quality of life 
or life expectancy following a heart attack are unlikely to be driven by 
differences in access to medications.

Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) typically affects the elderly and can cause 
cognitive decline, resulting in its differential diagnosis with other 
neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, it is probably underdiagnosed; such 
under- and misdiagnosis prevents the patient from receiving the right treatment 
and significantly affects the quality of life and life expectancy. This 
investigation is an in-depth analysis of the actual incidence of iNPH in the 
population of the province served by our hospital (circa 580,000 individuals). 
The first phase of this study was conducted by visualizing a total of 1232 brain 
CT scans performed in the Emergency Departments of the four hospitals of our 
network on patients who were admitted for different complaints yet screened as 
suspicious for iNPH. Subsequently, corresponding Emergency Department medical 
records were investigated to understand the medical history of each patient in 
search of elements attributable to an alteration of CSF dynamics. The cohort of 
positive CT scans, according to the radiological and clinical inclusion 
criteria, included 192 patients. Among the reasons to require acute medical 
care, "Fall" was the most common. The cumulative incidence of CT scans 
suggestive of iNPH among the patients undergoing CT scans was as high as 15.58%, 
and the period prevalence calculated for the total amount of patients accessing 
the Emergency Departments was 1.084%. The real incidence of iNPH in the 
population may be underestimated, and the social burden linked to the assistance 
of patients suffering from such untreated conditions could be significantly 
relieved.

The aim of this study was to measure the effects on three-planar active cervical 
range of motion (ACROM) and self-perceived pain of elastic taping (ET) 
application in the cervical area. Thirty participants (n: 22-M and 8-F, age 35.4 
± 4.4 years; body height 173.1 ± 8.4 cm; body mass 73.5 ± 12.8 kg) in the study 
group (SG) and twenty participants (n: 11-M and 9-F, age 32.6 ± 3.9 years; body 
height 174.9 ± 10.9 cm; body mass 71.2 ± 12.9 kg) in the control group (CG) were 
recruited. All subjects had neck and cervical pain in baseline condition. Each 
group performed an ACROM test and measured the perceived pain in the neck based 
on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS 0--10, a.u.) at the baseline (T0), after 20' 
from the ET application (T1), and after three days of wearing the ET application 
(T2). Between T0 and T1, an ET was applied to the cervical area of the SG 
participants. Statistical analysis did not show any significant change in CG in 
any measurement session for ACROM and neck pain parameters. Conversely, the SG 
showed significant improvements for ACROM rotation to the left (T0 64.8 ± 
7.7°-T2 76.0 ± 11.1° p < 0.000) and right (T0 66.0 ± 11.9°-T2 74.2 ± 9.6° p < 
0.000), lateral inclination to the left (T0 37.5 ± 6.9°-T2 40.6 ± 10.8° p < 
0.000) and right (T0 36.5 ± 7.9°-T2 40.9 ± 5.2° p < 0.000), extension (T0 47.0 ± 
12.9°-T2 55.1 ± 12.3° p < 0.001), and flexion (T0 55.0 ± 3.6°-T2 62.9 ± 12.0° p 
< 0.006). A significant decrease was also measured in SG for pain NRS between T0 
and T2 (T0 7.5 ± 1.0°-T1 5.5 ± 1.4-T2 1.4 ± 1.5° p < 0.000). In conclusion, a 
bilateral and symmetrical ET cervical application is useful to enhance 
multiplanar ACROM and reduce subjective self-perceived cervical pain when it is 
needed. Based on the evidence, the use of ET on the neck is recommended for 
managing neck motion restrictions and pain in adult individuals.

BACKGROUND: The growing number of elderly patients in hospitals is a challenge 
for healthcare systems. The main objective is to measure the postoperative 
change in the cognitive status at hospital discharge and one year after 
discharge in elderly patients undergoing planned or deferrable surgery.
METHODS: We planned a prospective longitudinal study, single-center study: 
secondary care level hospital, enrolment from September 2018 to May 2019. We 
enroll elderly patients, aged above life expectancy in Italy, who underwent 
planned or deferrable surgery (men over 80.5 years old, women over 85.0 years 
old). In six months, we enrolled 76 eligible patients. We collected the scores 
of the clinical impairment scales Charlson Index, Barthel Index, and Six-Item 
Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT). The primary endpoint was the postoperative 
worsening of the cognitive status at one-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints 
aimed to describe postoperative disabilities and complications, to investigate 
possible risk factors for cognitive worsening, and to measure the role of 
anesthesia in cognitive changes.
RESULTS: We recorded an increased rate of pathological 6CIT values during the 
hospitalization period, rising from 39.47% to 55.26% (McNemar test, P=0.007), 
and this rate was still increased at 55.56% (P=0.021) one year after discharge. 
Anesthesia did not show any significant harmful effect on cognitive status. The 
preoperative hemoglobin value seems to be a risk factor for cognitive status and 
one-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had a significantly worse 6CIT value after planned 
surgery, which may derive in part from age and in part from hospitalization. It 
is difficult to determine if general anesthesia alone has no harmful effects on 
cognitive performance in patients at discharge and one year later. Further data 
are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) significantly impacts countries 
with varying income levels. We aimed to present worldwide estimates of its 
burden from 1990 to 2019 using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study.
METHODS: We derived cause-specific AF/AFL mortality and disability-adjusted 
life-year (DALY) estimates from the GBD 2019 study data. We used an 
age-period-cohort (APC) model to predict annual changes in mortality (net 
drifts), annual percentage changes from 50-55 to 90-95 years (local drifts), and 
period and cohort relative risks (period and cohort effects) between 1990 and 
2019 by sex and sociodemographic index (SDI) quintiles. This allowed us to 
determine the impacts of age, period, and cohort on mortality and DALY trends 
and the inequities and treatment gaps in AF/AFL management.
RESULTS: Based on GBD data, our estimates showed that 59.7 million cases of 
AF/AFL occurred worldwide in 2019, while the number of AF/AFL deaths rose from 
117 000 to 315 000 (61.5% women). All-age mortality and DALYs increased 
considerably from 1990 to 2019, and there was an increase in age risk and a 
shift in death and DALYs toward the older (>80) population. Although the global 
net drift mortality of AF/AFL decreased overall (-0.16%; 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = -0.20, 0.12 per year), we observed an opposite trend in the low-middle 
SDI (0.53%; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.63) and low SDI regions (0.32%; 95% CI = 0.18, 
0.45). Compared with net drift among men (-0.08%; 95% CI = -0.14, -0.02), women 
had a greater downward trend or smaller upward trend of AF/AFL (-0.21%; 95% 
CI = -0.26, -0.16) in mortality in middle- and low-middle-SDI countries 
(P < 0.001). Uzbekistan had the largest net drift of mortality (4.21%; 95% 
CI = 3.51, 4.9) and DALYs (2.16%; 95% CI = 2.05, 2.27) among all countries. High 
body mass index, high blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol consumption were more 
prevalent in developed countries; nevertheless, lead exposure was more prominent 
in developing countries and regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AF/AFL in 2019 and its temporal evolution from 1990 
to 2019 differed significantly across SDI quintiles, sexes, geographic 
locations, and countries, necessitating the prioritisation of health policies 
based on risk-differentiated, cost-effective AF/AFL management.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive central nervous system (CNS) 
cancer. GBM has a high mortality rate, with a median survival time of 12-15 
months after diagnosis. A poor prognosis and a shorter life expectancy may 
result from resistance to standard treatments such as radiation and 
chemotherapy. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been the mainstay treatment for GBM, but 
unfortunately, there are high rates of resistance with GBM bypassing apoptosis. 
A proposed mechanism for bypassing apoptosis is decreased ceramide levels, and 
previous research has shown that within GBM cells, BCL2L13 can inhibit ceramide 
synthase. This review aims to discuss the causes of resistance in GBM cells, 
followed by a brief description of BCL2L13 and an explanation of its mechanism 
of action. Further, lipids, specifically ceramide, will be discussed concerning 
cancer and GBM cells, focusing on ceramide synthase and its role in developing 
GBM. By gathering all current information on BCL2L13 and ceramide synthase, this 
review seeks to enable an understanding of these pieces of GBM in the hope of 
finding an effective treatment for this disease.

BACKGROUND: The patellofemoral joint is an important source of pain in knee 
osteoarthritis. Most biomechanical research in knee osteoarthritis has focused 
on the tibiofemoral joint during level walking. It is unknown what happens 
during stair negotiation in patients with patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis, a 
task commonly increasing pain. Conservative therapy for patellofemoral joint 
osteoarthritis includes the use of a sleeve knee brace. We aimed to examine the 
effect of a sleeve knee brace on knee biomechanics during stair negotiation in 
patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis patients.
METHODS: 30 patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis patients (40-70 years) ascended 
and descended an instrumented staircase with force plates under two conditions - 
wearing a Lycra flexible knee support (Bioskin Patellar Tracking Q Brace) and no 
brace (control condition). Knee joint kinematics (VICON) and kinetics were 
recorded.
FINDINGS: During stair ascent, at the knee, the brace significantly reduced the 
maximal flexion angle (2.70, P = 0.002), maximal adduction angle (2.00, 
P = 0.044), total sagittal range of motion (2.00, P = 0.008), total frontal 
range of motion (1.70, P = 0.023) and sagittal peak extension moment 
(0.05 Nm/kg, P = 0.043) compared to control. During stair descent, at the knee, 
the brace significantly reduced the maximal flexion angle (1.80, P = 0.039) and 
total sagittal range of motion (1.50, P = 0.045) compared to control.
INTERPRETATION: The small changes in knee joint biomechanics during stair 
negotiation observed in our study need to be investigated further to help 
explain mechanisms behind the potential benefits of a sleeve knee brace for 
painful patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis.

With an increasing aging population in many cities worldwide, promoting and 
maintaining the health of elderly individuals has become a pressing public 
health issue. Although greenspaces may deliver many health outcomes for the 
elderly population, existing evidence remains inconsistent, partly due to 
discrepancies in the measure of greenspace and health outcomes. In addition, few 
studies examined the effect of greenspace exposure on life expectancy at the 
individual level. Thus, this study comprehensively investigated the association 
between greenspace exposure and life expectancy among elderly adults in 
Guangzhou, China, based on the individual-level mortality dataset. The data were 
analyzed at both the individual level and aggregate level, and two types of 
buffers (straight-line vs. street-network buffer) were used to define individual 
greenspace exposure. After controlling for the random effects and multiple types 
of covariates, we found that 1) elderly individuals with higher greenspace 
exposure were associated with an increased life expectancy; 2) elderly 
individuals with lower socioeconomic status benefit more from greenspace (i.e., 
equigenesis hypothesis); 3) different greenspace measurements lead to different 
results; 4) greenspace had the highest effects on life expectancy and 
equigenesis within the street-network buffer distances of 3000 m and 2500 m, 
respectively. This study underscores the potential health benefits of greenspace 
exposure on elderly individuals and the importance of provision and upkeep of 
greenspace, especially among socially disadvantaged groups.

BACKGROUND: People with mental illness are more likely to be nicotine-dependent 
and they have a shorter life expectancy as a result of smoking. Although 
guidelines recommend smoking cessation support, this is rarely provided by 
psychiatric staff who often view the implementation of smoke-free policies 
critically.
METHOD: We undertook inductive thematic analysis of the free-text fields of a 
staff survey on smoking.
RESULTS: Feedback on the topic was often emotional and related to the areas 
patient care, staff and the protection of non-smokers. Participants were often 
concerned that smoking cessation could worsen the patient's psychiatric 
condition or lead to aggressive behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence for these concerns. It is important 
to counteract false assumptions by providing the appropriate training on smoking 
cessation.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Menschen mit psychischer Erkrankung sind häufiger 
nikotinabhängig und haben eine durch das Rauchen bedingte geringere 
Lebenserwartung. Auch wenn Leitlinien eine Rauchentwöhnung empfehlen, machen die 
Mitarbeiter:innen psychiatrischer Kliniken nur selten entsprechende Angebote und 
sehen die Einführung einer rauchfreien Umgebung häufig kritisch.
METHODE: In dieser Studie wurden die Freitextfelder einer Befragung der 
Psychiatrie-Beschäftigten zum Thema Rauchen einer induktiven thematischen 
Analyse unterzogen.
ERGEBNISSE: Die häufig emotional formulierten Rückmeldungen zum Thema bezogen 
sich auf die Bereiche Patient:innenversorgung, Personal und 
Nichtraucher:innenschutz. Häufig wurde angeführt, dass ein Rauchstopp die 
psychische Erkrankung der Patient:innen verschlechtern oder zu aggressivem 
Verhalten führen könnte.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Für die genannten Bedenken gibt es keine wissenschaftliche 
Evidenz. Es gilt, mit Schulungen des Personals den Fehlannahmen 
entgegenzuwirken.

Biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy for prostate cancer is a clinical 
dilemma. Patients at low risk of disease progression can be safely monitored. In 
Finland, options for those with reasonable life expectancy include salvage 
high-dose-rate brachytherapy and transurethral ultrasound ablation under 
magnetic resonance imaging guidance.

High body mass index (BMI), or excess body weight (EBW), represents a 
significant risk factor for a range of diseases, including cardiovascular 
diseases and cancers. The study sought to determine the burden of diseases 
attributable to EBW in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region from 1990 
and 2019. The analysis also included an exploration of this burden by age, sex, 
underlying cause, and sociodemographic index (SDI). We utilized publicly 
available data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019 to identify 
the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of diseases associated 
with EBW in MENA, spanning the period from 1990 to 2019. The GBD estimated the 
mean BMI and the prevalence of EBW using hierarchical mixed-effects regression, 
followed by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to determine the most 
accurate BMI distribution through comparison with actual data. In 2019, there 
were an estimated 538.4 thousand deaths (95% UI 369.9-712.3) and 17.9 million 
DALYs (12.9-23.1) attributable to EBW in the region. The DALYs attributable to 
EBW were higher in men (9.3 million [6.5-12.4]) than in women (8.5 million 
[6.4-10.8]). The age-standardized death and DALY rates for the diseases 
associated with EBW increased by 5.1% (- 9.0-25.9) and 8.3% (- 6.5-28.8), 
respectively, during the study period which was not significant. Egypt had the 
highest age-standardized mortality rate due to EBW (217.7 [140.0, 307.8]), while 
Yemen (88.6 [45.9, 143.5]) had the lowest. In 2019, the highest number of DALYs 
occurred among individuals aged 60 to 64 years old. Furthermore, we found a 
positive association between a nation's SDI and the age-standardized DALY rate 
linked to EBW. Cardiovascular disease emerged as the leading contributor to the 
EBW burden in MENA. The disease burden attributable to EBW showed a 
non-significant increase in MENA from 1990 to 2019.

BACKGROUND: Simulation models play an increasingly important role in tobacco 
control. Models examining the impact of nicotine vaping products (NVPs) and 
smoking tend to be highly specialized and inaccessible. We present the Smoking 
and Vaping Model (SAVM),a user-friendly cohort-based simulation model, adaptable 
to any country, that projects the public health impact of smokers switching to 
NVPs.
METHODS: SAVM compares two scenarios. The No-NVP scenario projects smoking rates 
in the absence of NVPs using population projections, deaths rates, life 
expectancy, and smoking prevalence. The NVP scenario models vaping prevalence 
and its impact on smoking once NVPs became popular. NVP use impact is estimated 
as the difference in smoking- and vaping-attributable deaths (SVADs) and 
life-years lost (LYLs) between the No-NVP and NVP scenarios. We illustrate 
SAVM's adaptation to the German adult ages 18+ population, the Germany-SAVM by 
adjusting the model using population, mortality, smoking and NVP use data.
RESULTS: Assuming that the excess NVP mortality risk is 5% that of smoking, 
Germany-SAVM projected 4.7 million LYLs and almost 300,000 SVADs averted 
associated with NVP use from 2012 to 2060. Increasing the excess NVP mortality 
risk to 40% with other rates constant resulted in averted 2.8 million LYLs and 
200,000 SVADs during the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: SAVM enables non-modelers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to 
analyze the potential population health effects of NVP use and public health 
interventions.

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disorder due to a 
deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-gla) due to mutations in the 
GLA gene. These mutations result in plasma and lysosome accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids, leading to progressive organ damage and reduced life 
expectancy. Due to the availability of specific disease-modifying treatments, 
proper and timely diagnosis and therapy are essential to prevent irreversible 
complications. However, diagnosis of FD is often delayed because of the wide 
clinical heterogeneity of the disease and multiple organ involvement developing 
in variable temporal sequences. This observation is also valid for renal 
involvement, which may manifest with non-specific signs, such as proteinuria and 
chronic kidney disease, which are also common in many other nephropathies. 
Moreover, an additional confounding factor is the possibility of the coexistence 
of FD with other kidney disorders. Thus, suspecting and diagnosing FD 
nephropathy in patients with signs of kidney disease may be challenging for the 
clinical nephrologist. Herein, also through the presentation of a unique case of 
co-occurrence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and FD, we review 
the available literature on cases of coexistence of FD and other renal diseases 
and discuss the implications of these conditions. Moreover, we highlight the 
clinical, laboratory, and histological elements that may suggest clinical 
suspicion and address a proper diagnosis of Fabry nephropathy.

BACKGROUND: There is little evidence on experiences in psychiatric care 
treatment among patients with immigrant or ethnic minority background. Knowledge 
about their experiences is crucial in the development of equal and high-quality 
services and is needed to validate instruments applied in national patient 
experience surveys in Norway. The aim of this scoping review is to assess and 
summarize current evidence on immigrant and ethnic minorities` experiences in 
psychiatric care treatment in Europe.
METHODS: Guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed and the 
research process adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The literature search was 
carried out in Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane database of systematic 
reviews, Embase, and APA PsychInfo, up to Dec 2022, for articles on immigrant 
patients` experiences in psychiatric care. Reference lists of included articles 
were screened for additional relevant articles. Titles and abstracts were 
screened, and potentially relevant articles read in full-text, by two 
researchers. Evidence was extracted using an a priori extraction form and 
summarized in tables and text. Any disagreement between the reviewers regarding 
inclusion of articles or extracted information details were resolved through 
discussion between authors.
RESULTS: We included eight studies in the scoping review. Immigrant and ethnic 
minority background patients did not differ from the general population in 
quantitative satisfaction questionnaires. However, qualitative studies showed 
that they experience a lack of understanding and respect of own culture and 
related needs, and difficulties in communication, which do not seem to be 
captured in questionnaire-based studies.
CONCLUSION: Raising awareness about the importance of respect and understanding 
for patients` cultural background and communication needs for treatment 
satisfaction should be addressed in future quality improvement work.

AP30663 is a novel compound under development for pharmacological conversion of 
atrial fibrillation by targeting the small conductance Ca2+ activated K+ (KCa 2) 
channel. The aim of this extension phase 1 study was to test AP30663 at higher 
single doses compared to the first-in-human trial. Sixteen healthy male 
volunteers were randomized into two cohorts: 6 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg intravenous 
single dose administration of AP30663 vs. placebo. Safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and pharmacodynamic data were collected. AP30663 was associated with mild and 
transient infusion site reactions with no clustering of other adverse events but 
with an estimated maximum mean QTcF interval prolongation of 45.2 ms (95% CI 
31.5 - 58.9) in the 6 mg/kg dose level and 50.4 ms (95% CI 36.7 - 64.0) with 8 
mg/kg. PK was dose proportional with terminal half-life of around 3 hours. 
AP30663 in doses up to 8 mg/kg was associated with mild and transient infusion 
site reactions and an increase of the QTcF interval. Supplementary studies 
support that the QTc effect may be explained by an off-target inhibition of the 
IKr channel.

OBJECTIVES: Improved life expectancy has led to an ageing population of people 
living with HIV in most countries. Research on ageing among people living with 
HIV has predominantly focused on physical and health-related quality of life 
rather than multidimensional quality of life. We measured quality of life among 
older people living with HIV in Australia and identified opportunities to guide 
the development and implementation of appropriate interventions.
METHODS: In a national health and wellbeing survey of Australian people living 
with HIV, participants aged ≥50 years completed additional questions relevant to 
ageing. Quality of life was measured using PozQoL, a validated multidimensional 
instrument assessing quality of life among people living with HIV (range 1-5). 
Exploratory bivariate analyses aimed to identify sociodemographic 
characteristics associated with quality of life. Adjusted linear regressions 
aimed to assess changes in PozQoL score associated with recent experiences (last 
12 months) of four exposures: food insecurity, HIV-related stigma, isolation 
from the HIV community, and difficulties accessing non-HIV health services.
RESULTS: Among 319 older people living with HIV, the mean PozQol score was 3.30 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 3.20-3.39). In bivariate analyses, PozQol scores 
were significantly higher among participants who were older (p = 0.006), had 
higher educational attainment (p = 0.009), were in a relationship (p = 0.005), 
were employed (p = 0.005), and had a higher income (p = 0.001). In adjusted 
regression models, PozQoL scores were lower among participants who reported 
recent experiences of food insecurity (β -0.49; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.24), stigma 
(β -0.53; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.33), isolation from the HIV community (β -0.49; 95% 
CI -0.70 to -0.29), and difficulties accessing non-HIV health services (β -0.50; 
95% CI -0.71 to -0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, older people living with HIV in this study had a moderate 
quality of life. Our findings suggest that HIV services should integrate
