BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular brain disorder with 
non-negligible multifaceted economic costs. Existing preventive treatments 
involve the selective use of onabotulinumtoxinA, which aims at migraine 
morbidity reduction for patients who have failed initial preventive treatment 
with oral agents. Erenumab is a new preventive treatment for migraines.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in costs and outcomes of the preventive 
treatment with erenumab versus onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with chronic 
migraines (CM) in Greece to assess the economic value of this treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from both the payer and the 
societal perspective using a decision-tree analytic model. Outcomes were 
expressed in migraines avoided and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We 
obtained model inputs from the existing literature. The decision path adjusted 
for variation in the probability of adherence and the resulting differential 
effectiveness between the two treatments. Direct costs included the cost of the 
two drugs and administration costs, the costs of acute drugs used under usual 
care, and the costs of hospitalization, physician, and emergency department 
visits. Indirect costs for the societal perspective analyses included wages lost 
on workdays. The time-horizon of the analysis was 1 year and all costs were 
calculated in 2019 euros (€). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to control for 
parameter uncertainty and to evaluate the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that treatment of CM with erenumab compared to 
onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 
€218,870 and €231,554 per QALY gained and €620 and €656 per migraine avoided, 
from the societal and the payer's perspective, respectively. Using a common 
cost-effectiveness threshold equal to three times the local gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita (€49,000), for the erenumab ICERs to fall below this 
threshold, the erenumab price would have to be no more than €192 (societal 
perspective) or €173 (payer perspective).
CONCLUSION: The prophylactic treatment of CM with erenumab in Greece might be 
cost effective compared to the existing alternative of onabotulinumtoxinA from 
both the payer and the societal perspective, but only at a highly discounted 
price. Nevertheless, erenumab could be considered a therapeutic option for 
patients who fail treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown favorable clinical outcomes for 
coronary CT angiography (CTA) in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS). Our goal was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of coronary CTA as 
compared to alternative management strategies for ACP patients over lifetime.
METHODS: Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare 
cost-effectiveness of competitive strategies for ACP patients: 1) coronary CTA, 
2) standard of care (SOC), 3) AHA/ACC Guidelines, and 4) expedited emergency 
department (ED) discharge protocol with outpatient testing. ROMICAT-II trial was 
used to populate the model with low to intermediate risk of ACS patient data, 
whereas diagnostic test-, treatment effect-, morbidity/mortality-, quality of 
life- and cost data were obtained from the literature. We predicted test 
utilization, costs, 1-, 3-, 10-year and over lifetime cardiovascular 
morbidity/mortality for each strategy. We determined quality adjusted life years 
(QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Observed outcomes in ROMICAT-II 
were used to validate the short-term model.
RESULTS: Estimated short-term outcomes accurately reflected observed outcomes in 
ROMICAT-II as coronary CTA was associated with higher costs ($4,490 vs. 
$2,513-$4,144) and revascularization rates (5.2% vs. 2.6%-3.7%) compared to 
alternative strategies. Over lifetime, coronary CTA dominated SOC and ACC/AHA 
Guidelines and was cost-effective compared to expedited ED protocol 
($49,428/QALY). This was driven by lower cardiovascular mortality (coronary CTA 
vs. expedited discharge: 3-year: 1.04% vs. 1.10-1.17; 10-year: 5.06% vs. 
5.21-5.36%; respectively).
CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA in patients with suspected ACS renders affordable 
long-term health benefits as compared to alternative strategies.

The joint and relative effects of future land-use and climate change on fire 
occurrence in the Amazon, as well its seasonal variation, are still poorly 
understood, despite its recognized importance. Using the maximum entropy method 
(MaxEnt), we combined regional land-use projections and climatic data from the 
CMIP5 multimodel ensemble to investigate the monthly probability of fire 
occurrence in the mid (2041-2070) and late (2071-2100) 21st century in the 
Brazilian Amazon. We found striking spatial variation in the fire relative 
probability (FRP) change along the months, with October showing the highest 
overall change. Considering climate only, the area with FRP ≥ 0.3 (a threshold 
chosen based on the literature) in October increases 6.9% by 2071-2100 compared 
to the baseline period under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 
and 27.7% under the RCP 8.5. The best-case land-use scenario ("Sustainability") 
alone causes a 10.6% increase in the area with FRP ≥ 0.3, while the worse-case 
land-use scenario ("Fragmentation") causes a 73.2% increase. The optimistic 
climate-land-use projection (Sustainability and RCP 4.5) causes a 21.3% increase 
in the area with FRP ≥ 0.3 in October by 2071-2100 compared to the baseline 
period. In contrast, the most pessimistic climate-land-use projection 
(Fragmentation and RCP 8.5) causes a widespread increase in FRP (113.5% increase 
in the area with FRP ≥ 0.3), and prolongs the fire season, displacing its peak. 
Combining the Sustainability land-use and RCP 8.5 scenarios causes a 39.1% 
increase in the area with FRP ≥ 0.3. We conclude that avoiding the regress on 
land-use governance in the Brazilian Amazon (i.e., decrease in the extension and 
level of conservation of the protected areas, reduced environmental laws 
enforcement, extensive road paving, and increased deforestation) would 
substantially mitigate the effects of climate change on fire probability, even 
under the most pessimistic RCP 8.5 scenario.

As life expectancy increases, the number of people affected by progressive and 
irreversible dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is predicted to grow. No drug 
designs seem to be working in humans, apparently because the origins of AD have 
not been identified. Invoking amyloid cascade, metal ions, and ROS production 
hypothesis of AD, herein we share our point of view on Cu(II) binding properties 
of Aβ4-x, the most prevalent N-truncated Aβ peptide, currently known as the main 
constituent of amyloid plaques. The capability of Aβ4-x to rapidly take over 
copper from previously tested Aβ1-x peptides and form highly stable complexes, 
redox unreactive and resistant to copper exchange reactions, prompted us to 
propose physiological roles for these peptides. We discuss the new findings on 
the reactivity of Cu(II)Aβ4-x with coexisting biomolecules in the context of 
synaptic cleft; we suggest that the role of Aβ4-x peptides is to quench Cu(II) 
toxicity in the brain and maintain neurotransmission.

Older workers' plans for activities in retirement: The role of opportunities, 
spousal support, and time perception.

Retirement is a major life-course transition for which some people plan more 
than others. Given that planning positively affects retirement adjustment, it is 
important to investigate the heterogeneity in retirement planning and its 
antecedents. While financial preparation has been thoroughly investigated, 
little is known about the activities older workers plan to do in retirement. We 
hypothesize that older workers' plans for retirement activities can be 
categorized into 3 domains: bridge employment, self-developmental leisure, and 
social leisure. Moreover, we expect these plans to be affected by workers' 
opportunities for continuity, spousal support, and perception of time. We test 
these hypotheses using data from the first wave of the Netherlands 
Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute Pension Panel Study (NPPS). The study 
consists of a sample of almost 6,800 Dutch older workers who were asked about 
their plans to engage in 10 different activities in retirement. Where relevant, 
spouses of older workers were also surveyed, providing multiactor data for these 
couples (N = 4,052). Our results support the classification of retirement 
activity plans into 3 domains. Moreover, the results of structural equation 
models confirm that the activities for which older workers plan are related to 
their opportunity structure (i.e., occupational status, number of preretirement 
leisure activities, number of social roles), spousal support to engage in these 
activities, and older workers' perception of time (i.e., future time 
perspective, perceived life expectancy). Our findings can help identify older 
workers who might face a more difficult retirement transition, because they have 
fewer plans to address the various psychosocial aspects of retirement. (PsycINFO

BACKGROUND: Falls in older people is a global public health concern. Physical 
exercise is a useful and potentially cost-saving treatment option to prevent 
falls in older people.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (1) summarize the research literature regarding the 
cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programs for falls prevention in older 
people and (2) discuss the implications of the review's findings for clinical 
practice and future research on the dosage of cost-effective exercise-based 
falls prevention programs for older people.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched from inception until February 2019. 
Studies were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials with an 
economic evaluation of exercise-based falls prevention programs for people ≥ 60 
years old and (2) assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per 
quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost per fall and benefit-to-cost ratio 
of programs. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence 
Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of Health 
Economic Studies.
RESULTS: We included 12 studies (3668 older people). Interventions for falls 
prevention were either exercise-only or multifactorial programs. Five studies of 
high economic quality and 2 of high methodological quality provided evidence 
supporting exercise-only programs as cost-effective for preventing falls in 
older people. Specifically, a tailored exercise program including strengthening 
of lower extremities, balance training, cardiovascular exercise, stretching and 
functional training of moderate intensity performed twice per week with each 
session lasting 60min for ≥ 6 months delivered in groups of 3 to 8 participants 
with home-based follow-up appears to be cost-effective in preventing falls in 
older people.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence to support exercise-based interventions as 
cost-effective treatment for preventing falls. Further research is needed to 
fully establish the cost-effectiveness of such programs, especially in both 
developing and underdeveloped countries.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death in England, 
and poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the principle behavioural risk 
factors. In the context of increasingly constrained financial resources, 
decision makers in England need to be able to compare the potential costs and 
health outcomes of different public health policies aimed at improving these 
risk factors in order to know where to invest so that they can maximise 
population health. This paper describes PRIMEtime CE, a multistate life table 
cost-effectiveness model that can directly compare interventions affecting 
multiple disease outcomes.
METHODS: The multistate life table model, PRIMEtime Cost Effectiveness 
(PRIMEtime CE), is developed from the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) 
and the PRIMEtime model. PRIMEtime CE uses routinely available data to estimate 
how changing diet and physical activity in England affects morbidity and 
mortality from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver disease, and cancers 
either directly or via raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and body weight.
RESULTS: Model outcomes are change in quality adjusted life years, and change in 
English National Health Service and social care costs.
CONCLUSION: This paper describes PRIMEtime CE and highlights its main strengths 
and limitations. The model can be used to compare any number of public policies 
affecting diet and physical activity, allowing decision makers to understand how 
they can maximise population health with limited financial resources.

Stillbirths: how should its rate be reported, its disability-adjusted-life-years 
(DALY), and stillbirths adjusted life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: A 2016 study standardized the definition of stillbirths. It 
estimated the rate as a proportion of total births. A 2015 paper addressed the 
problem of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) for stillbirths. There has been 
no adjustment of life expectancy at birth to account for stillbirths.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We follow mathematical and computational methods, use 
algebra to derive relationships, and large databases. We express the rate as a 
proportion of live births and use this rate to adjust life expectancy at birth 
for stillbirths. We then use the difference between the traditional life 
expectancy and stillbirths adjusted life expectancy (SALE) to obtain DALY for 
stillbirths for 194 countries, the Millennium Development Goal regions, and 
income groups. We show defining stillbirths' rate as a proportion of live births 
enhances stillbirths' importance, especially in poorer countries; negates some 
of its under-statement vis-a-vis neonatal mortality rate, accentuates its 
decrease; and permits inference about relative magnitudes of stillbirths and 
neonatal mortality from the two rates. Using it, we derive stillbirths adjusted 
life expectancy, and suggest it reflects a more complete and accurate measure of 
comparative life expectancies of different countries. Its difference from the 
traditional life expectancy is used to measure DALY for stillbirths that totals 
165.3 million years worldwide.
CONCLUSION: Stillbirths almost equals neonatal mortality yet have not received 
almost equal attention. We hope highlighting them and adjusting life expectancy 
for it will spur health interventions so that grand convergence of health 
outcomes in different countries can be more rapidly achieved. We also believe 
SALE is a more complete and accurate measure of comparative life expectancies.

BACKGROUND: PRIMEtime CE is a multistate life table model that can directly 
compare the cost effectiveness of public health interventions affecting diet and 
physical activity levels, helping to inform decisions about how to spend finite 
resources. This paper estimates the costs and health outcomes in England of two 
scenarios: reformulating salt and expanding subsidised access to leisure 
centres. The results are used to help validate PRIMEtime CE, following the steps 
outlined in the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision 
models (AdViSHE) tool.
METHODS: The PRIMEtime CE model estimates the difference in quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and difference in NHS and social care costs of modelled 
interventions compared with doing nothing. The salt reformulation scenario 
models how salt consumption would change if food producers met the 2017 UK Food 
Standards Agency salt reformulation targets. The leisure centre scenario models 
change in physical activity levels if the Birmingham Be Active scheme (where 
swimming pools and gym access is free to residents during defined periods) was 
rolled out across England. The AdViSHE tool was developed by health economic 
modellers and divides model validation into five parts: validation of the 
conceptual model, input data validation, validation of computerised model, 
operational validation, and other validation techniques. PRIMEtime CE is 
discussed in relation to each part.
RESULTS: Salt reformulation was dominant compared with doing nothing, and had a 
10-year return on investment of £1.44 (£0.50 to £2.94) for every £1 spent. By 
contrast, over 10 years the Be Active expansion would cost £727,000 (£514,000 to 
£1,064,000) per QALY. PRIMEtime CE has good face validity of its conceptual 
model and has robust input data. Cross-validation produces mixed results and 
shows the impact of model scope, input parameters, and model structure on 
cost-per-QALY estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper illustrates how PRIMEtime CE can be used to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of two different public health measures affecting diet and 
physical activity levels. The AdViSHE tool helps to validate PRIMEtime CE, 
identifies some of the key drivers of model estimates, and highlights the 
challenges of externally validating public health economic models against 
independent data.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a defining characteristic of Muscular Dystrophy 
(MD); however, yet while speculated, objective measures of muscle weakness has 
not been reported in relation to quality of life in adults with MD.
OBJECTIVES: 1) compare the self-reported QoL of adults with Duchenne MD (DMD), 
Beckers MD (BMD), Limb-Girdle MD (LGMD) and Fascioscapulohumeral MD (FSHD, and a 
non-MD (CTRL) group; 2) present and compare between groups measures of 
Impairment (Muscle Strength and Activities of Daily Living) and Perception 
(Fatigue, Pain and Self-Efficacy); and 3) identify associations between QoL 
domains and measures of Impairment and Perception (See above).
METHODS: Seventy-Five males, including MD classifications DMD, BMD, LGMD, FSHD 
and CTRL, completed measures for QoL, Knee-Extension Maximal Voluntary 
Contraction (KEMVC), Fatigue, Pain, Self-Efficacy and Activities of Daily Living 
(ADL).
RESULTS: QoL was lower across many domains in MD than CTRL. FSHD scored lower 
than DMD for mental wellbeing domains. KEMVC associated with Physical-Function 
domain for BMD. Pain, Self-Efficacy and ADLs associated with QoL domains, with 
Fatigue the most consistently associated.
CONCLUSION: The present study identified differences between MD classifications 
within self-perceptions of mental-health. Muscle weakness is a defining feature 
of MD; however, it doesn't define QoL in adults with MD. A greater understanding 
of mental wellbeing, independence, and management of fatigue and pain, are 
required to improve QoL for adults with MD.

To date, systemic treatments, including hormone therapies or chemotherapy, are 
used at different stages of prostate cancer disease. Several types of 
complications can occur during systemic treatment in prostate cancer, depending 
on the therapeutic range. The most common with hormone therapy are fatigue, 
muscle loss, bone loss, high blood pressure and metabolic syndromes. For 
chemotherapy, the most significant risk is related to hematological toxicity, 
but peripheral neuropathies, mucositis, diarrhea and hypersensitivity reactions 
may also occur. The quality of the pre-treatment assessment and the rigorousness 
of patient follow-up make it possible to anticipate most of these events, to 
prevent them or to manage them at an early stage when they occur. The most 
important aspect is patient education, which involves comprehensive information 
and the implementation of supportive care as soon as the treatment is initiated. 
Specialized advice (e. g. cardiological or endocrinological) is recommended in 
the event of uncontrolled symptomatology. The resumption of treatment leading to 
a major complication should be the subject of a multidisciplinary discussion 
taking into account the severity of the event, its reversibility, the patient's 
life expectancy and the expected efficacy of the molecule.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of disease due to pneumonia in older adults has a major 
impact on health systems. The aim of this study is to carry out an economic 
evaluation of the vaccination strategy against Streptococcus pneumoniae using 
the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A simulated economic model has been developed in the form 
of a decision tree to evaluate the cost of the vaccination strategy in the 
population over 65 years of the Valladolid-East Health Area, versus 
non-vaccination, using a Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis.
RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae annually generates 557.24 cases of 
pneumococcal disease in the Valladolid-East Health Area, and 506.60 episodes 
have pneumonia symptoms. Vaccination of the cohort over 65 years of age is an 
efficient measure from the third year, with a cost per quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) of 20,496.20 €. The number of QALYs gained in a decade is 86.07 and 
an amount of 216.252.89 € with this vaccination strategy would be saved.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of the different incremental costs (QALY,euros) in 
the years of follow-up, the pneumococcus vaccination program in people over 65 
in Castilla y León is cost-effective.

The use of multiple medications is common in palliative care, putting patients 
at risk of adverse events and a high tablet burden. Deprescribing is the process 
of reviewing and stopping potentially inappropriate medications in order to 
improve quality of life. Barriers to deprescribing exist meaning many patients 
will take multiple medications despite being in the final months of life. The 
OncPal deprescribing guideline is a useful tool to support the process for 
patients with a limited life expectancy. There is evidence for the safety of 
stopping certain medications, particularly those aimed at primary prevention. A 
systematic process of reviewing individual medications and their appropriateness 
is recommended.

Temperature affects the development, population dynamics, reproduction and 
population size of insects. Thaumastocoris peregrinus Carpintero et Dellape 
(Heteroptera: Thaumastocoridae) is a eucalyptus pest. The objective of this 
study was to determine biological and life table parameters of T. peregrinus on 
Eucalyptus benthamii at five temperatures (18 °C; 22 °C; 25 °C; 27 °C and 30 °C) 
with a relative humidity (RH) of 70 ± 10% and photoperiod of 12 hours. The 
duration of each instar and the longevity of this insect were inversely 
proportional to the temperature, regardless of sex. The nymph stage of T. 
peregrinus was 36.4 days at 18 °C and 16.1 days at 30 °C. The pre-oviposition 
period was 5.1 days at 30 °C and 13.1 days at 18 °C and that of oviposition was 
7.6 days at 30 °C and 51.2 days at 22 °C. The generation time (T) of T. 
peregrinus was 27.11 days at 22 °C and 8.22 days at 30 °C. Lower temperatures 
reduced the development and increased the life stage duration of T. peregrinus. 
Optimum temperatures for T. peregrinus development and reproduction were 18 and 
25 °C, respectively.

Peripheral arterial disease is a chronic vascular disease characterized by 
impaired circulation to the lower extremities. Its most severe stage, known as 
critical limb ischemia (CLI), puts patients at an increased risk of 
cardiovascular events, amputation, and death. The objective of this literature 
review is to describe the burden of disease across a comprehensive set of 
domains-epidemiologic, clinical, humanistic, and economic-focusing on key 
studies published in the last decade. CLI prevalence in the United States is 
estimated to be approximately 2 million and is likely to rise in the coming 
years given trends in important risk factors such as age, diabetes, and smoking. 
Hospitalization for CLI patients is common and up to 60% are readmitted within 6 
months. Amputation rates are unacceptably high with a disproportionate risk for 
certain demographic and socioeconomic groups. In addition to limb loss, CLI 
patients also have reduced life expectancy with mortality typically exceeding 
50% by 5 years. Given the poor clinical prognosis, it is unsurprising that the 
quality of life burden associated with CLI is significant. Studies assessing 
quality of life in CLI patients have used a variety of generic and 
disease-specific measures and all document a substantial impact of the disease 
on the patient's physical, social, and emotional health status compared to 
population norms. Finally, the poor clinical outcomes and increased medical 
resource use lead to a considerable economic burden for national health care 
systems. However, published cost studies are not comprehensive and, therefore, 
likely underestimate the true economic impact of CLI. Our summary documents a 
sobering assessment of CLI burden-a poor clinical prognosis translating into 
diminished quality of life and high costs for millions of patients. Continued 
prevention efforts and improved treatment strategies are the key to ameliorating 
the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.

INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is an inherited abnormality of 
haemoglobin associated with reduced life expectancy. Patients' complications 
include dyslipideamia. This study was aimed at determining the artherogenic 
index of plasma (AIP) in sickle cell anaemia patients and compares the value to 
HbAA controls value. A high AIP is strongly predictive of elevated 
cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: A comparative study was conducted among SCA patients attending the 
haematology clinic, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) and HbAA 
Phenotype controls. A total of 304 participants were recruited consisting of 
equal numbers of SCA and HbAA controls. Single lipid profiles were done; 
logarithms of triglycerides/high density lipoprotein were calculated to obtain 
AIP and lipid profile ratios established for all participants.
RESULTS: There were lower mean values of Total Cholesterol (TC), High Density 
Lipoprotein(HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) amongst SCD participants than 
controls and higher mean values of triglycerides (TG) and Very Low Density 
Lipoprotein (VLDL) in SCD p < 0.05. The AIP in SCD ranges from -0.62 to 1.32 
while that of controls ranges from -0.56 to 0.61.The mean AIP were 0.14 ± 0.29 
and -0.009 ± 0.26 in SCD and controls respectively. P value = 0.002.
CONCLUSION: AIP value is higher in sickle cell anaemia than controls, the former 
have lower mean values of TC, HDL and LDL and higher mean values of TG and VLDL.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy and is 
associated with increased risk of complications and early mortality. Nowadays, 
with improved health care facilities, antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccination, and 
availability of drugs like hydroxyurea, the life expectancy of SCD patients has 
improved. More women are reaching reproductive age group and are expressing 
their desire to reproduce. Though SCD adversely affects pregnancy, leading to 
increased incidence of maternal and perinatal complications like pre-eclampsia, 
preterm labor, IUGR, abortions etc., adequate care throughout pregnancy ensures 
a better outcome. Also, recent advancements in the fields of prenatal diagnosis 
and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, help couples suffering from SCD to have a 
healthy baby. This paper focuses on the effects of SCD on pregnancy outcomes and 
effective management of complications during pregnancy, also comparing maternal 
and perinatal outcomes in studies conducted in different countries. The second 
part of the paper summarizes pregnancy management in SCD for better maternal and 
fetal outcomes.

The late Pleistocene faunal assemblage from Bat Cave, central Ozarks, Missouri 
provides an opportunity to assess specific aspects of behavior, ecology, and 
ontogeny of the Rancholabrean species Platygonus compressus. All identifiable 
elements referable to this taxon were catalogued and examined, and a minimum 
number of individuals of 73 was determined for the sample. Evidence of seasonal 
behavioral patterns are reported for the first time in a fossil peccary. 
Maturation of individuals was assessed using the tooth eruption sequence and 
occlusal wear patterns for all tooth-bearing mandibular elements and isolated 
lower dentition. Approximate ages were established through comparison with the 
extant collared peccary. The presence of distinct, developmentally 
non-overlapping age groups suggests that P. compressus was seasonally present at 
the Bat Cave locality, with the cave functioning as seasonal shelter in which 
individuals would occasionally die. The study also suggests the peccaries 
engaged in synchronous, seasonal breeding behaviors. Demographic assessment of 
the Bat Cave peccary population suggests that younger individuals formed the 
bulk of the population at a given time with progressively older individuals 
becoming scarcer until the age of about 10 years, which matches the typical 
demographic patterns and life expectancy of extant peccaries.

Changes in chromatin organization occur during aging. Overexpression of histones 
partially alleviates these changes and promotes longevity. We report that 
deletion of the histone H3-H4 minor locus HHT1-HHF1 extended the replicative 
life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This longevity effect was mediated 
through TOR signaling inhibition. We present evidence for evolutionarily 
conserved transcriptional and phenotypic responses to defects in chromatin 
structure, collectively termed the chromatin architectural defect (CAD) 
response. Promoters of the CAD response genes were sensitive to histone dosage, 
with HHT1-HHF1 deletion, nucleosome occupancy was reduced at these promoters 
allowing transcriptional activation induced by stress response transcription 
factors Msn2 and Gis1, both of which were required for the life-span extension 
of hht1-hhf1Δ. Therefore, we conclude that the CAD response induced by moderate 
chromatin defects promotes longevity.

The application of combined hypoxia and hypercapnia (hypercapnic hypoxia) during 
respiratory exercises results in a maximum increase in resistance to acute 
hypoxia and ischemic tolerance of the brain. The results of those researches 
allow the assumption that hypercapnic hypoxia is a promising method for 
prophylaxis, treatment, and rehabilitation, as well as a means to increase life 
expectancy. The study was conducted to verify the hypothesis that it is possible 
to extend the life span through regular courses of respiratory exercises with 
hypercapnic hypoxia. In the present experimental research carried out on mice, 
the geroprotective effect of regular hypercapnic-hypoxic exercises (PO2-90 mm Hg 
and PCO2-50 mm Hg) was assessed in the context of the average life expectancy 
and the main criteria of its quality (reproductive function, muscle strength, 
and behavior). Results suggest that with regular training, life span is extended 
significantly by 16%. This result was accompanied by improved reproductive and 
cognitive functions, increased motor and search activities, and physical stamina 
in old age mices. This important phenomenon is accompanied by improved 
reproductive and cognitive functions, high motor function and search activity, 
as well as better physical stamina in old-aged mices. Recurring respiratory 
training under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia (hypercapnic hypoxia) during the 
lifetime significantly extended the life span of mice in the experiments.

PURPOSE: A stroke is a debilitating condition that can cause lifelong 
disability, severely limiting the ability of individuals to perform daily 
activities. In Japan, strokes are the fourth leading cause of death; however, no 
previous studies have examined the influence of strokes on a disabled or 
disability-free life for older Japanese residents. This study aims to address 
this gap.
METHODS: The study used data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal 
Study of Aging (NUJLSOA) and incidence-based multistate life tables to estimate 
disabled and disability-free life expectancy based on the stroke status of 
Japanese residents aged 65 and older.
RESULTS: Japanese stroke survivors aged 65 who experienced an initial 
disability-free state could expect to live approximately 3 fewer total years of 
life, 4-5 fewer years in a disability-free state, and 1-2 more years in a 
disabled state compared to those without history of a stroke (p < 0.05). For 
those disabled at the beginning of the survey interval, the differences between 
individuals with and without stroke history were also similar to those 
disability-free at the beginning of the survey interval (2-4 and 5-6 fewer total 
and disability-free years, respectively) (p < 0.05). The same pattern was 
observed for older age groups.
CONCLUSION: Older adults who have experienced a stroke could experience a 
shorter total life expectancy, shorter disability-free life expectancy, and 
longer disabled life expectancy than those who have not experienced a stroke. 
These results can inform policymakers and rehabilitation practitioners on stroke
