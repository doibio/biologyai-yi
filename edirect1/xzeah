(halting aging completely, leading to an average life expectancy of 1000 years) 
can lead to severe overpopulation even at very low fertility rates. This formula 
also enables us to ascertain what fertility rate and birth spacing will prevent 
life extension from causing severe overpopulation. The moral issues arise if 
radical life extension causes overpopulation severe enough to outweigh the 
benefits it brings. New Methuselahs proposed a reproductive policy for avoiding 
severe overpopulation by limiting reproduction for those who use life extension. 
We then consider a moral objection to this policy that was not discussed in New 
Methuselahs: it is not likely that society will succeed in imposing limits to 
reproduction, therefore, it is likely that radical life extension is morally 
wrong. We respond to this objection and defend our response against two further 
objections.

BACKGROUND: Today, in response to consumer demand and market trends, the 
development of new packaging with better performance such as intelligent 
packaging has become more important. This packaging system is able to perform 
intelligent functions to increase shelf life, increase safety and improve 
product quality.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, various types of packaging systems are available for meat 
products, especially cooked, fresh and processed meats. But because meat 
products are very perishable, monitoring their quality and safety in the supply 
chain is very important. This systematic article briefly reviews some of the 
recent data about the application of intelligent packaging in meat products.
METHODS: The search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, Elsevier, 
Springer, Scopus, and PubMed, from April 1996 to April 2021 using a different 
combination of the following keyword: intelligent packaging, and meat.
RESULTS: The results showed that the intelligent packaging presents several 
benefits compared to traditional packaging (e.g., antimicrobial, antioxidant, 
and shelf life extension) at the industrial processing level. Thus, these 
systems have been applied to improve the shelf life and textural properties of 
meat and meat products.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to control the number of intelligent compounds that 
are included in the packaging as they clearly influence the quality and 
nutritional properties as well as the final cost of the food products.

BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer an alternative to 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin for treating cancer-associated 
thrombosis (CAT).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost and effectiveness of DOACs versus LMWH.
DESIGN: Cohort-state transition decision analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: Network meta-analysis comparing DOACs versus LMWH.
TARGET POPULATION: Adult patients with cancer at the time they develop 
thrombosis.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Strategies of 1) enoxaparin, 2) apixaban, 3) edoxaban, and 4) 
rivaroxaban for treatment of CAT.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2022 U.S. 
dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In the base-case scenario, using drug prices from 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, apixaban 
dominated enoxaparin and edoxaban by being less costly and more effective. 
Rivaroxaban was slightly more effective than apixaban, with an ICER of $493 246. 
In a scenario analysis using "real-world" drug prices from GoodRx, rivaroxaban 
was cost-effective with an ICER of $50 053 per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were highly sensitive to monthly drug 
costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50 000 per QALY, apixaban was preferred in 80% of simulations. 
However, sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that apixaban only remained 
cost-effective if monthly medication costs were below $530. Above this, 
rivaroxaban became cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: An assumption was made that patients would continue anticoagulation 
indefinitely unless they suffered a major bleed. Nonmedical costs such as 
patient and caregiver loss of productivity were not accounted for, and long-term 
thrombotic complications were not explicitly modeled.
CONCLUSION: The 3 DOACs are more effective and more cost-effective than LMWH. 
The most cost-effective DOAC depends on the relative cost of each of these 
agents. These are important considerations for treating physicians and health 
policymakers.

Childhood dementias are a group of over 100 rare and ultra-rare pediatric 
conditions that are clinically characterized by chronic global neurocognitive 
decline. This decline is associated with a progressive loss of skills and 
shortened life expectancy. With an estimated incidence of one in 2800 births and 
less than 5% of the conditions having disease-modifying therapies, the impact is 
profound for patients and their families. Traditional research, care, and 
advocacy efforts have focused on individual disorders, or groups classified by 
molecular pathogenesis, and this has established robust foundations for further 
progress and collaboration. This review describes the shared and 
disease-specific clinical changes contributing to childhood dementia and 
considers these as potential indicators of underlying pathophysiologic 
processes. Like adult neurodegenerative syndromes, the heterogeneous phenotypes 
extend beyond cognitive decline and may involve changes in eating, motor 
function, pain, sleep, and behavior, mediated by physiological changes in neural 
networks. Importantly, these physiological phenotypes are associated with 
significant carer stress, anxiety, and challenges in care. These phenotypes are 
also pertinent for the development of therapeutics and optimization of best 
practice management. A collective approach to childhood dementia is anticipated 
to identify relevant biomarkers of prognosis or therapeutic efficacy, streamline 
the path from preclinical studies to clinical trials, increase opportunities for 
the development of multiple therapeutics, and refine clinical care.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a significant concern nationally and research now 
highlights higher rates of alcohol attributable death (AAD) and years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) veterans 
compared to non-LGB veterans. In this study, we examined specific causes of AAD 
and associated YPLL between LGB and non-LGB veteran men and women to highlight 
needed outreach, prevention, and treatment strategies.
METHODS: Using data from the nationwide Veterans Health Administration 
electronic health record and National Death Index from 2014 to 2018, we examined 
the top ten ranked causes of AAD among LGB (n = 102,085) and non-LGB veteran 
(n = 5,300,521) men and women, as well as associated YPLL per AAD.
RESULTS: We observed higher rates of AAD among men than women, but higher rates 
among LGB veterans relative to their same-sex non-LGB counterparts. We noted 
greater YPLL per AAD among LGB men and all women compared to non-LGB men, even 
when of similar or same rank in cause of death. Acute-cause AAD death (e.g., 
alcohol-related suicide, poisonings) was ranked higher among LGB men and all 
women. YPLL was greater for both acute- and chronic-cause AAD (e.g., liver 
disease) among LGB men and all women compared to non-LGB men.
CONCLUSIONS: Causes of AAD differ between LGB and non-LGB men and women. The 
differences observed highlight disparities in acute- and chronic-cause AAD 
between groups help explain the higher number of YPLL per AAD that disfavor LGB 
men and women veterans, and essential next steps in primary and secondary 
prevention of hazardous drinking and mortality risk.

Objective: To identify the prevalence of multimorbidity among a Chinese 
population, analyze the risk of all-cause mortality with different 
multimorbidity patterns, and the impact of exercise on the risk of 
multimorbidity-related mortality and life lost. Methods: The study was based on 
437 408 MJ Health Management Center participants. The classification decision 
tree was used to explore multimorbidity patterns composed of hypertension, 
diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate the 
all-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR) for different multimorbidity patterns. 
Using Chiang's life table method, years of life lost were the difference in life 
expectancy for those with and without multimorbidity. Results: The prevalence 
rate of multimorbidity was 8.7%. Among multivariate patterns, the most common 
ones were "hypertension+CKD" (3.6%), "hypertension + diabetes + CKD" (1.1%) and 
"hypertension+diabetes+CKD+COPD" (0.1%). Compared with a healthy population, 
patterns with the highest mortality risk were "diabetes+CKD" (HR=3.80, 95%CI: 
3.45-4.18), "diabetes+CKD+COPD" (HR=4.34, 95%CI: 3.43-5.49) and "hypertension+ 
diabetes+CKD+COPD" (HR=4.75,95%CI:4.15-5.43). Through low-intensity and moderate 
to high-intensity exercise, the increased HRs were attenuatedcompared with the 
inactive population. People with single disease and multimorbidity shortened 
life by 4.6 and 13.4 years, while exercise attenuated 2.3 and 4.6 years of life 
lost, of which low-intensity and moderate to high-intensity exercise saved 1.5 
and 3.7 years of life lost due to chronic diseases. Conclusions: Multimorbidity 
patterns based on "diabetes + CKD" cause the highest mortality risk, and 
physical activity in reducing mortality was significant for either with or 
without multimorbidity. Higher exercise intensity leads to a greater relative 
reduction of mortality risk.

Objective: Healthy life expectancy (HLE), which combines life expectancy with 
health, is an essential comprehensive measure of life length and quality. This 
article aimed to systematically review the methods for defining and measuring 
HLE and describe application studies published, providing a reference for 
decision makers to select and develop methods suitable for China's conditions to 
measure HLE. Methods: Seven Chinese and English literature databases were 
searched up to May 7, 2022, and several related reviews and bibliography were 
manually retrieved. Systematic reviews and empirical research were included 
concerning HLE indicators and measurement of HLE. Information including the 
study area, type of the study, study population, HLE index, measurement method, 
data sources, and results from application studies published in the last five 
years were extracted. The evolution of the definition of HLE, the scope of 
different indicators, the measurement scale of health, and measurement methods, 
were all collected. Results of the empirical research related to measurement 
methods of indicators were summarized. The study followed the scoping review 
framework and was written according to the PRISMA-ScR statement. Results: A 
total of 84 articles were included, including 13 reviews, 17 original studies 
related to HLE index definition, ten original studies related to index 
measurement, and 44 empirical studies conducted in the past five years. There 
were as many as 20 indicators related to HLE, and each scale had its emphasis. A 
total of ten methods measuring HLE were identified, which vary in the definition 
of health, whether using weight, and the data type. The most commonly used 
indicators in the past five years were disability-free life expectancy and HLE. 
For the method of HLE calculation, Sullivan's method was mainly used for 
cross-sectional data, and the multistate life table was mainly used for 
longitudinal data. Conclusions: There are various definitions and measurement 
methods of HLE, but none are suitable for all scenarios. To summarize the HLE 
concept, health evaluation techniques, measurement methods, and application 
studies published worldwide can provide a reference for the localization of HLE 
measurement in China.

Higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and elevated neutrophil counts are 
consistently reported in the blood of patients with schizophrenia. Stressors 
during childhood and/or adolescence are major socioenvironmental risk factors 
for schizophrenia and may contribute to immune dysregulation. Previous studies 
using blood cytokines to stratify patients with schizophrenia suggest that only 
a subset presents a low-grade inflammatory state. However, these studies have 
not addressed whether environmental factors such as childhood maltreatment 
contributed to identifying inflammatory clusters. Moreover, a neutrophil-related 
mechanism (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps; NETs) central to both the initiation 
and chronicity of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has never been 
investigated in psychiatry. Elevated NETs in schizophrenia may predispose 
patients to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases resulting in reduced life 
expectancy. We, therefore, investigated NETs as a novel mechanism and biological 
target in early schizophrenia and their role together with IL-6 and childhood 
maltreatment in identifying cluster subgroups. We found increased NETs in the 
plasma of patients with early schizophrenia (n = 78) compared to both their 
unaffected siblings (n = 25) and community controls (n = 78), irrespective of 
sex, body mass index, psychoactive drug use, or tobacco smoking. Increased NETs 
in patients were unrelated to antipsychotic treatment, which was further tested 
in vitro using fresh neutrophils. By applying unsupervised two-step clustering 
analysis, we integrated values of NETs, IL-6, and childhood maltreatment scores. 
We identified two main clusters; childhood maltreatment scores and NETs were the 
most important variables contributing to cluster separation (high-CL1 and 
low-CL2), while IL-6 was the least contributor. Patients allocated in the 
high-CL1 (61.5%) had significantly higher childhood maltreatment scores, NETs, 
and IL-6 levels than the remaining groups (patients low-CL2, siblings, and 
controls high-CL1 and low-CL2). We complemented these findings with a rat model 
based on stress exposure during adolescence that results in several 
schizophrenia-like changes in adulthood. We found that adolescent stressed rats 
had higher NETs and IL-6 levels in serum compared to non-stressed rats with a 
tendency to produce more NETs from the bone marrow. Altogether, this study 
brings a novel cellular-based mechanism in schizophrenia that, combined with 
early-stress, could be useful to identify subgroups for more personalised 
treatments.

Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that 
even at very low levels can cause cancer by increasing the activity of tumor 
cells and suppressing the immune system. There is also little information on 
OCPs and survival after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to monitor the 
concentration of OCPs in the blood serum of cancer patients and its relationship 
with their socio-demographic characteristics and ultimately that impact on 
survival time and hazard ratio (HR). This cross-sectional study included 89 
diagnosed patients with cancer in Isfahan, Iran. 12 types of OCPs were measured 
in serum by gas chromatography (7GC) with an electron capture detector and 
equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). Also, participants' questionnaire was 
completed to collect information. T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used 
to evaluate the association between serum levels of OCPs and quantitative and 
qualitative information of patients. Survival analysis was also examined based 
on Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model. The mean of total OCPs in 
patients' serum was calculated to be 1.82 ± 1.36 μg/L. Concentration of 2,4' DDE 
had a significant relationship with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (P < 0.05). In 
addition, gender revealed a significant correlation in estimating survival time 
(P < 0.05). Non-exposure to OCPs showed a positive effect on increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. Lindane and endosulfan increased the risk of death by 
16% and 37%, respectively, with insignificant P value (P > 0.05). The findings 
of the present study showed adverse effects of OCPs on patients' survival time 
and increased mortality of HR. Moreover, as the first research conducted in the 
study area, it is suggested management of environmental, individual and social 
factors that could be influenced the biological accumulation of OCPs in humans 
and cause health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most important barriers to increasing life 
expectancy in all countries in the 21st century. Investigations of new 
anti-cancer drugs with low side effects are an urgent demand for medicinal 
chemists. Considering the known antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of 
thiazoles, this work presents the synthesis and antineoplastic activity of new 
thiazoles.
METHODS: The 22 new compounds (2a-v) were synthesized from different 
thiosemicarbazones and 2-bromoacetophenone. The compounds were evaluated on: 
MOLT-4, HL-60, HL-60/MX1, MM1S, SKMEL-28, DU145, MCF-7, and T47d.
RESULTS: Compound 2b induced cellular viability on MOLT-4 (37.1%), DU145 
(41.5%), and HL- 60/MX1 (58.8%) cells. On MOLT-4 cells, compound 2b exhibited an 
IC50 of 8.03 μM, and against DU145 cells, an IC50 of 6.04μM. Besides, at IC50 
and fold of IC50, 20% to 30% of dead cells were found, most due to necrosis/late 
apoptosis. Most compounds no showed cytotoxicity against fibroblast cells L929 
at the concentrations tested. The compound did not alter the cell cycle of DU145 
cells when compared to the negative control. Therefore, compound 2b stands out 
against DU145 and MOLT-4 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study reinforced the importance of 1,3-thiazoles nuclei in 
antitumor activity. In addition, derivative 2b stands out against DU145 and 
MOLT-4 cells and could be a starting point for developing new antineoplastic 
agents.

A healthy diet and regular physical activity (PA) are delineated as healthy 
behaviours. Their implementation is associated with better health outcomes and 
improved quality of life. There is less evidence of a relationship between 
dietary patterns (DP) and PA, especially in adults aged ≥ 85. Hence, this 
cross-sectional study investigates the association between DP and PA in people 
of this age group, using the data from The Kawasaki Aging and Well-Being 
Project. Brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire was used to 
estimate the intake of fifty-eight types of food. After energy adjustment, 
principal component analysis was performed to identify DP. PA was measured 
objectively using an accelerometer and subjectively using a questionnaire 
validated for this age group. Thousand participants (median age: 86·9 years, 
men: 49·9 %) were included in the analysis. Three major DP (DP1 'various foods', 
DP2 'red meats and coffee', DP3 'bread and processed meats') were identified. 
DP1 'various foods' was similar to DP previously named 'healthy' or 'prudent' 
and showed a positive association with PA time (PAT) as measured by 
accelerometer (B, 6·25; 95 % CI 0·13, 12·37) and relatively shorter sedentary 
behaviour (SB) time. DP2 'red meats and coffee' and DP3 'bread and processed 
meats' were negatively associated with PAT and positively associated with SB 
time. This study observed the relationship between diet and PA behaviours in 
adults aged ≥ 85, with healthier and more food-diverse DP associated with longer 
PAT and relatively unhealthy DP with shorter PAT.

BACKGROUND: No official estimates have been published regarding healthy life 
expectancy in Algeria, and chronic disease-free life expectancy in particular, 
despite their importance for assessing public health policy effectiveness and 
predicting social security expenditure.
AIMS: To estimate chronic disease-free life expectancy in Algeria and analyse 
its changes in recent years, and to determine how morbidity has changed 
according to age, time, and gender, compared with mortality, following expansion 
of morbidity, compression of morbidity, or morbidity-mortality balance.
METHODS: We used Sullivan's method to estimate chronic disease-free life 
expectancy in Algeria using data provided from the Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Surveys and national life tables published by the Office for National Statistics 
for 2006, 2012-2013, and 2018-2019. The changes in healthy/unhealthy years 
compared with life expectancy were analysed.
RESULTS: Although Algerian women live an average 1-2 years longer than men, 
their chronic disease-free life expectancy is 5 years shorter. The gain in life 
expectancy between 2006 and 2018-2019 was accompanied by a decline in chronic 
disease-free life expectancy from 62.36 and 57.27 years to 61.13 and 55.64 years 
for men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Algerians in 2018-2019 lived longer but not healthier than in 2006, 
and the number of unhealthy life years increased compared with life expectancy. 
Thus, public health programmes need to be more efficient to increase healthy 
years faster, or at least at the same pace as life expectancy.

Publisher: تحليل التغيرات الحديثة في متوسط العمرِ المتوقع بدون أمراض مزمنة في 
الجزائر. فريد فليسي، مريم شينون.
الخلفية: ليس هناك أي تقديرات رسمية منشورة عن متوسط العمر الصحي، ولا سيما العمر 
المتوقع دون أمراض مزمنة في الجزائر، رغم أهميتها في تقييم فعالية سياسات الصحة 
العامة والتنبؤ بإنفاقات الضمان الاجتماعي.
الأهداف: هدفت هذه الدراسة الى تقدير العمر المتوقع دون أمراض مزمنة في الجزائر 
وتغيراته في السنوات الأخيرة، وتحديد كيفية تغيََّّر المراضة حسب العمر والزمن 
والجنس، بالمقارنة مع الوفيات، وفقاً لتوسع المراضة أو ضغط المراضة أو التوازن بين 
المراضة والوفيات.
طرق البحث: استخدمنا طريقة سوليفان لتقدير العمر المتوقع دون أمراض مزمنة، باستخدام 
البيانات الواردة من المسوحات العنقودية المتعددة المؤشرات وجداول الحياة التي 
نشرها الديوان الوطني للإحصاء عن الأعوام 2006 ، وما بين عامَي 2012 – 2013 ، وما 
بين عامَي 2018 – 2019. وحللنا التغيرات في سنوات العمر الصحية وسنوات العمر غير 
الصحية ومتوسط العمر المتوقع.
النتائج: رغم أن المرأة الجزائرية تعيش في المتوسط أطول من الرجل ما بين عام إلى 
عامين، إلا أن متوسط عمر المرأة الجزائرية المتوقع دون أمراض مزمنة كان أقل بخمس 
سنوات. ارتفاع العمر المتوقع بين عامَي 2006 و 2018 / 2019 قد صاحبها انخفاض العمر 
المتوقع بدون أمراض مزمنة من 62.36 إلى 61.13 سنة للرجال و 57.27 إلى 55.64 سنة 
للنساء.
الاستنتاجات: في عامَي 2018 – 2019 ، عاش الجزائريون عمرًا أطول لكنه لم يكن أكثر 
صحةً من 2006 ، وارتفع عدد سنوات الحياة غير الصحية مقارنة بالعمر المتوقع. ومن 
ثَم، ينبغي أن تكون برامج الصحة العامة أكثر كفاءة لزيادة السنوات الصحية بسرعة 
أكبر، أو على الأقل بنفس وت يرة إرتفاع العمر المتوقع.

Publisher: Analyse de l'évolution récente de l'espérance de vie sans maladies 
chroniques en Algérie.
CONTEXTE: En Algérie, aucune estimation officielle n'a été publiée concernant 
l'espérance de vie en bonne santé, en particulier l'espérance de vie sans 
maladies chroniques, malgré l'importance de ces deux indicateurs pour évaluer 
l'efficacité des politiques de santé publique et prévoir les dépenses de 
sécurité sociale.
OBJECTIFS: Estimer l'espérance de vie sans maladies chroniques en Algérie et 
analyser son évolution au cours des dernières années, ainsi que déterminer 
comment la morbidité à évolué selon l'âge, le temps et le genre, par rapport à 
la mortalité, suivant l'expansion et la compression de la morbidité ou 
l'équilibre morbidité-mortalité.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons utilisé la méthode de Sullivan pour estimer l'espérance de 
vie sans maladies chroniques en Algérie à l'aide des données fournies par les 
enquêtes par grappes à indicateurs multiples et les tables de mortalité 
nationales publiées par l'Office National des Statistiques pour 2006, 2012-2013 
et 2018-2019. L'évolution des années de bonne et de mauvaise santé 
comparativement à l'espérance de vie a été analysée.
RÉSULTATS: Bien que les femmes algériennes aient vécu en moyenne un à deux ans 
de plus que les hommes, leur espérance de vie sans maladies chroniques était 
plus courte de cinq ans. Le gain d'espérance de vie entre 2006 et 2018-2019 
s'est accompagné d'une baisse de l'espérance de vie sans maladies chroniques de 
62,36 à 61,13 ans pour les hommes et de 57,27 à 55,64 ans pour les femmes.
CONCLUSION: En 2018-2019, les Algériens ont vécu plus longtemps sans pour autant 
être en meilleure santé qu'en 2006, et le nombre d'années de vie en mauvaise 
santé a augmenté par rapport à l'espérance de vie. Les programmes de santé 
publique devraient donc être plus efficaces afin que les années en bonne santé 
augmentent plus rapidement, ou du moins au même rythme que l'espérance de vie.

Despite the widespread use of antibiotics, deep neck infections are still a 
relevant clinical problem and can cause severe and potentially life-threatening 
complications. Imaging plays a pivotal role into the clinical management of deep 
neck infections, allowing identification of the source of infections, definition 
of the precise extension of the disease and early diagnosis of local or distant 
complications. The complex anatomy of deep neck spaces may hide the actual 
extent of disease: the knowledge of neck anatomy enables radiologists to rapidly 
evaluate expected routes of spread of infections and to effectively communicate 
crucial information to surgeons. Computed Tomography is the most used imaging 
modality for assessing primary site of infection, extent of disease and local 
complications. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used as a second level imaging 
modality for individuating intracranial or spinal complications. The present 
work aims to review the imaging of deep neck spaces infections, focusing on 
relevant anatomy and clinical scenarios, underlining practical teaching points 
for each of them. Familiarity with deep neck spaces anatomy and knowledge of 
most common routes of spread of infections allow the radiologist to make a 
prompt diagnosis and to look for early signs of potential complications.

Globally, accelerated aging is taking place alongside increased life expectancy 
of the population. This poses a challenge to maintaining autonomy and 
independence as people age but preventing falls and disabilities. Currently, 
there are few specific technologies on the market that are focused on the 
rehabilitation and promotion of autonomy in older adults. This study presents 
the development of a prototype (Myoviber®) of a low-cost, wearable everyday 
garment, designed to stimulate the lower limbs by the application of focal 
muscle vibration and incorporating technical textile qualities. The presented 
approach is proactive and preventive, maintaining functionality for the elderly 
while integrating electronic technology into an everyday garment. For this, a 
comprehensive study was carried out that included the design of the leggings 
through anthropometric analyses, the development of vibration devices at a 
stable frequency located in the knee extensor muscle and a smart belt with 
wireless connection, and the optimization of the battery autonomy. The 
development of the prototype was carried out through the construction of a 
vibratory device, which was validated with biomechanical evaluations. The 
results show an increase in the functional capacity of the lower limbs, in 
relation to motor tasks such as postural balance and gait in older people.

BACKGROUND: Redox biology balances free radical generation and scavenging 
systems, whereas an imbalanced cellular redox can hasten the onset of various 
diseases and be regarded as a Pandora's box of ailments. The current study aims 
to assess the pathophysiological impact of intergenerational resveratrol 
treatment on diabetes-related cognitive and cardio-renal disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Diabetic rats of the first, second, and third generations 
were subjected to an intergenerational treatment of resveratrol 
(20 mg/kg/p.o./day) for 5 months. During this period, the second generation of 
animals (pups of the first generation) was produced. After the adulthood of 
second-generation rats, they used to produce third-generation rats. The rats of 
each generation were evaluated for physiological parameters (BMI, litter size, 
and life expectancy) and the pathological impact of streptozotocin 
(55 mg/kg/i.p.), cognitive dysfunctions, and cardio-renal injury.
RESULTS: The intergenerational treatment of resveratrol significantly reduced 
litter size and improved anthropometric parameters, life expectancy, and blood 
glucose levels in diabetic animals. Resveratrol treatment ameliorates oxidative 
stress as measured by increased serum nitrite/nitrate concentrations, SOD 
activity, reduced glutathione concentrations, total serum antioxidant capacity, 
and diminished serum TBARS level in diabetic animals. Furthermore, diabetic rats 
receiving intergenerational resveratrol treatment showed improved cognitive 
behaviour and cardio-renal functionality when compared to the disease control 
group.
CONCLUSION: The intergenerational treatment of resveratrol improved the 
physiological traits and vital abilities of the heart, kidney, and brain, which 
endorse its antioxidant potential. Surprisingly, resveratrol treatment increases 
the second and third generations' resistance to neurobehavioral changes, 
diabetes, and -associated cardio-renal dysfunction, implying that these 
generations are "super-pups."

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends 
a second-line treatment of pemigatinib for patients with intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) 
fusions/rearrangements and modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) for those without FGFR2 
alterations. However, these regimens are not yet covered by Taiwa's National 
Health Insurance. This cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of the pemigatinib/mFOLFOX regimen as the second-line 
treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma based on FGFR2 status in 
comparison with the regimen of fluorouracil chemotherapy and provided a 
cost-effectiveness analysis-based reference price for pemigatinib.
METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model with a 5-year time horizon was 
constructed for patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who did 
not respond to first-line therapy. Overall and progression-free survival 
functions of pemigatinib, mFOLFOX, and fluorouracil were estimated from the 
FIGHT-202, ABC-06, and NIFTY trials, respectively. The utility of health states 
and disutility of adverse events were obtained from the literature. The genetic 
testing fee and price of pemigatinib were set as the market price. Other costs 
related to advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were calculated using 
National Health Insurance claims data. The willingness-to-pay threshold was 
three times the gross domestic product per capita in 2021 (NT$2,889,684). A 3% 
discount rate was applied to quality-adjusted life-years and costs. Scenario 
analyses included a gradual price reduction of pemigatinib, alternative survival 
models, application of a National Health Insurance payment conversion factor to 
non-medication costs, and consideration of life-years as effectiveness. A 
deterministic sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a 
value of information analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The new regimen provided an incremental 0.13 quality-adjusted 
life-years, with incremental costs of NT$459,697, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of NT$3,411,098 per quality-adjusted life-year and an 
incremental net monetary benefit of - NT$70,268. The new regimen was found to be 
53.2% cost effective in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The expected 
value of uncertainty measured by the expected value of perfect information was 
NT$80,695/person. In scenario analyses, the incremental net monetary benefit was 
positive when the price of pemigatinib was reduced by 40% or more. When applying 
a conversion factor to non-medical costs, the probability of the new regimen 
being cost effective was slightly increased from 53.2 to 56.5% compared with the 
base-case analysis. The utility and the cost of the new regimen were the main 
drivers of uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the new second-line genetic-based and biomarker-driven 
regimen of pemigatinib/mFOLFOX appears not cost effective for patients with 
advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the base-case analysis, our analysis 
suggests it is highly likely to be cost effective in the case of a 40% price 
reduction on pemigatinib.

BACKGROUND: Efficiency refers the use of resources in ways that optimise desired 
outcomes. Health system efficiency is a priority concern for policy makers 
globally as countries aim to achieve universal health coverage, and face the 
additional challenge of an aging population. Efficiency analysis in the health 
sector has typically focused on the efficiency of healthcare facilities 
(hospitals, primary healthcare facilities), with few studies focusing on system 
level (national or sub-national) efficiency. We carried out a thematic review of 
literature that assessed the efficiency of health systems at the national and 
sub-national level.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Google scholar between 
2000 and 2021 and a manual search of relevant papers selected from their 
reference lists. A total of 131 papers were included. We analysed and 
synthesised evidence from the selected papers using a thematic approach 
(selecting, sorting, coding and charting collected data according to identified 
key issues and themes).
FINDINGS: There were more publications from high- and upper middle-income 
countries (53%) than from low-income and lower middle-income countries. There 
were also more publications focusing on national level (60%) compared to 
sub-national health systems' efficiency. Only 6% of studies used either 
qualitative methods or mixed methods while 94% used quantitative approaches. 
Data envelopment analysis, a non-parametric method, was the most common 
methodological approach used, followed by stochastic frontier analysis, a 
parametric method. A range of regression methods were used to identify the 
determinants of health system efficiency. While studies used a range of inputs, 
these generally considered the building blocks of health systems, health risk 
factors, and social determinants of health. Outputs used in efficiency analysis 
could be classified as either intermediate health service outputs (e.g., number 
of health facility visits), single health outcomes (e.g., infant mortality rate) 
or composite indices of either intermediate outputs of health outcomes (e.g., 
Health Adjusted Life Expectancy). Factors that were found to affect health 
system efficiency include demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the 
population, macro-economic characteristics of the national and sub-national 
regions, population health and wellbeing, the governance and political 
characteristics of these regions, and health system characteristics.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the limited evidence on health system 
efficiency, especially in low- and middle-income countries. It also reveals the 
dearth of efficiency studies that use mixed methods approaches by incorporating 
qualitative inquiry. The review offers insights on the drivers of the efficiency 
of national and sub-national health systems, and highlights potential targets 
for reforms to improve health system efficiency.
