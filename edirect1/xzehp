BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants have the potential to impact vaccine 
effectiveness and duration of vaccine-derived immunity. We analyzed U.S. 
multi-jurisdictional COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough surveillance data to examine 
potential waning of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection for the 
Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b) primary vaccination series by age.
METHODS: Weekly numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections during January 16, 2022-May 28, 
2022 were analyzed by age group from 22 U.S. jurisdictions that routinely linked 
COVID-19 case surveillance and immunization data. A life table approach 
incorporating line-listed and aggregated COVID-19 case datasets with vaccine 
administration and U.S. Census data was used to estimate hazard rates of 
SARS-CoV-2 infections, hazard rate ratios (HRR) and percent reductions in hazard 
rate comparing unvaccinated people to people vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech 
primary series only, by age group and time since vaccination.
RESULTS: The percent reduction in hazard rates for persons 2 weeks after 
vaccination with a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series compared with unvaccinated 
persons was lowest among children aged 5-11 years at 35.5% (95% CI: 33.3%, 
37.6%) compared to the older age groups, which ranged from 68.7%-89.6%. By 19 
weeks after vaccination, all age groups showed decreases in the percent 
reduction in the hazard rates compared with unvaccinated people; with the 
largest declines observed among those aged 5-11 and 12-17 years and more modest 
declines observed among those 18 years and older.
CONCLUSIONS: The decline in vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
observed in this study is consistent with other studies and demonstrates that 
national case surveillance data were useful for assessing early signals in 
age-specific waning of vaccine protection during the initial period of 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant predominance. The potential for waning immunity 
during the Omicron period emphasizes the importance of continued monitoring and 
consideration of optimal timing and provision of booster doses in the future.

Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation has steadily increased 
in the United States owing to increased life expectancy, better access to health 
care, and the adoption of updated guidelines. Transvenous lead extraction (TLE) 
is an invasive technique for the removal of CIED devices, and the most common 
indications include device infections, lead failures, and venous occlusion. 
Although in-hospital and procedure-related deaths for patients undergoing TLE 
are low, the long-term mortality remains high with 10-year survival reported 
close to 50% after TLE. This is likely demonstrative of the increased burden of 
comorbidities with aging. There are guidelines provided by various professional 
societies, including the Heart Rhythm Society, regarding indications for lead 
extraction and management of these patients. In this paper, we will review the 
indications for CIED extraction, procedural considerations, and management of 
these patients based upon the latest guidelines.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in severe 
loss of function and independence. Nerve transfers have become a powerful method 
for restoring upper extremity function, the most critical missing function 
desired by this patient population. Recovery of active elbow extension allows 
for expansion of one's workspace to reach for objects and stabilizes control at 
the elbow joint. Without triceps function, a patient with a cervical SCI is 
rendered entirely helpless when in the supine position. Our objective was to 
provide a concise description of the transfer of branches of the axillary nerve 
(AN) to the long head of the triceps branch of the radial nerve (RN) for 
restoration of elbow extension after cervical SCI.
METHODS: An anterior, axillary approach is used for the transfer of the nerve 
branches of the AN (which may include branches to the teres minor, posterior 
deltoid, or even middle deltoid) to the long head of the triceps branch of the 
RN. Preoperative assessment and intraoperative stimulation are demonstrated to 
direct optimal selection of axillary branch donors.
RESULTS: The axillary approach provides full access to all branches of the AN in 
optimal proximity to triceps branches of the RN and allows for tension-free 
coaptation to achieve successful recovery of elbow extension. Final outcomes may 
not be achieved for 18 months. Of our last 20 patients with greater than 
12-month follow-up, 13 have achieved antigravity strength in elbow extension, 4 
are demonstrating ongoing progression, and 3 are definitive failures by 18 
months.
CONCLUSION: The axillary to RN transfer is an important intervention for 
recovery of elbow extension after cervical SCI, which significantly improves 
quality of life in this patient population. Further large population outcomes 
studies are necessary to further establish efficacy and increase awareness of 
these procedures.

Chestnut tannins (CNT), as a source of hydrolyzable tannins, positively affect 
the antioxidant status of livestock. In the current study, 90 male Hu lambs were 
used to investigate the effect of dietary CNT intake on growth performance, 
nutrient digestibility, meat quality and oxidative stability, rumen microbial, 
and the transcriptomes of muscle and liver. A completely randomized design with 
three CNT intake levels (0, 0.3%, and 0.6%) was used. Rumen microbial and 
nutrient digestibility were not significantly altered by CNT intake. Diets with 
0.3% CNT intake significantly reduced the shear force, yellowness at 24 h, and 
C20:2 polyunsaturated fatty acids of lamb meat and malondialdehyde in serum and 
longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle. Meanwhile, the 0.3% CNT diet significantly 
increased average daily gain during the 1- 21 days and 64- 90 days, dry matter 
intake during the 1- 21 days, the slaughter weight, and liver index of lambs. 
The 0.3% CNT diet significantly increased C26:0 saturated fatty acids, total 
antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase 
in LT muscle. The meat shelf life of 0.3% CNT and 0.6% CNT groups was prolonged 
by 8.7 h and 5.4 h, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CNT 
supplementation can induce the expression of antioxidant enzyme gene (CAT, 
SOD1), and the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in 
antioxidant activity, transferase activity, and adenosine triphosphate binding. 
These results suggest that 0.3% CNT intake can relieve the oxidative stress of 
lambs, and improve the stability of meat color and meat tenderness, due to the 
enhanced antioxidative capacity.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Indigenous People suffer a high burden of kidney disease. 
Those receiving maintenance dialysis have worse outcomes compared with similarly 
treated non-Indigenous patients. We characterized the experiences of Indigenous 
patients receiving dialysis in British-colonized countries to gain insights into 
which aspects of kidney care may benefit from improvement.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of published qualitative interview studies.
SETTING & STUDY POPULATIONS: Indigenous Peoples aged 18 years and over, 
receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in British-colonized countries.
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Search terms for Indigenous Peoples, dialysis, 
and qualitative research were entered into Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL 
and searched from inception to January 5, 2023.
DATA EXTRACTION: Characteristics of each study were extracted into Microsoft 
Excel for quality assessment.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Data were analyzed using thematic synthesis.
RESULTS: The analysis included 28 studies involving 471 participants from 
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. We identified four 
themes: centrality of family and culture (continuing dialysis for family, 
gaining autonomy through shared involvement, balancing primary responsibility to 
care for family); marginalization due to structural and social inequities 
(falling through gaps in primary care intensifying shock, discriminated against 
and judged by specialists, alienated and fearful of hospitals, overwhelmed by 
travel, financial and regimental burdens); vulnerability in accessing health 
care (need for culturally responsive care, lack of language interpreters, 
without agency in decision-making, comorbidities compounding complexity of 
self-management); and distress from separation from community 
(disenfranchisement and sorrow when away for dialysis, inability to perpetuate 
cultural continuity, seeking a kidney transplant).
LIMITATIONS: We only included articles published in English.
CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous patients receiving dialysis experience inequities in 
health care that compound existing accessibility issues caused by colonization. 
Improving the accessibility and cultural responsiveness of dialysis and kidney 
transplant services in collaboration with Indigenous stakeholders holds promise 
to enhance the experience of Indigenous patients receiving dialysis.
PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Worldwide Indigenous populations suffer a high incidence 
of chronic disease leading to lower life expectancy, particularly for kidney 
disease, an insidious condition requiring long-term dialysis treatment. By 
listening to Indigenous dialysis patients' stories, we hoped to understand how 
to improve their experience. We gathered 28 qualitative research studies from 
four countries reporting Indigenous adults' experiences of dialysis. They 
described lacking awareness of kidney disease, poor access to health services, 
systemic racism, inadequate cultural safety, and being dislocated from family, 
community, and culture. These findings indicate that respectful collaboration 
with Indigenous Peoples to craft and implement policy changes holds promise to 
improve prevention, integrate culturally responsive health care practices, and 
provide better access to local dialysis services and opportunities for kidney 
transplants.

INTRODUCTION: Disparities in life expectancy between rural and urban populations 
are well established but how it varies with epidemics and pandemics remains 
poorly understood. We aimed to quantify the rural-urban differences in the 
mortality burden of COVID-19 and to contribute to understanding the disparity 
trends in life expectancy between 1987 and 2021 in China.
METHODS: We used monthly death counts from death registration systems. 
Rural-urban gap estimation and decomposition were carried out using period life 
tables to calculate life expectancy, the Arriaga decomposition technique to 
break down into age-specific and cause-specific mortality, and the Lee-Carter 
forecasts to estimate the expected gap.
RESULTS: The rural-urban gap increased to 22.7 months (95% credible interval 
(CI) 19.6 to 25.8) in 2020 and further to 23.7 months (95% CI 19.6 to 26.7) in 
2021, and was larger than expected under the continuation of the prepandemic 
trends. Compared with that in the recent 2003 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and the 2009 
influenza epidemic, excess rural-urban gaps in the COVID-19 pandemic changed 
from urban disadvantage to rural disadvantage, and the contributions shifted 
toward old age groups and circulatory diseases. Variations in the rural-urban 
gap since 1987 were positively correlated with the rural-urban disparity in 
public health expenditures, especially among ages <60 (p values <0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identified a widening rural-urban gap in life 
expectancy since COVID-19, and a shifting trend towards old ages and circulatory 
diseases, disrupting the diminishing trend of the gap over 35 years. The 
findings highlight the unequal impact of the pandemic on different communities 
in terms of mortality burdens.

Triadimefon is a typical systemic fungicide that is widely used in the 
management of powdery mildew, rust disease, and southern blight. In this study, 
we measured fungicide residue to profile its absorption, translocation, and 
accumulation in three representative vegetable crops (Pak choi, cucumber, and 
pepper) after over-application. The fungicides were applied through entire-plant 
spraying (EPS), root-irrigation (RI), and middle-leaf-daubing (MLD). The 
half-life of triadimefon depends on the application method and plant species. In 
EPS, the half-life was 5.42 days (Pak choi), 6.86 days (cucumber), and 6.73 days 
(pepper), while in RI it was 4.39 days (Pak choi), 6.30 days (cucumber), and 
5.98 days (pepper). In the EPS treatment, triadimefon is translocated both 
upward/outside and downward/inner-side from the daubed leaves in all the three 
vegetable crops. The transfer amount to each organ reached a peak on the 2nd day 
after fungicide application. The mesophyll of Pak choi exhibited a higher 
fungicide deposition compared to the petiole. In cucumber and pepper, the leaves 
demonstrated the highest accumulation of triadimefon (approximately 0.3-0.5 
mg·kg-1), followed by stems. Roots and fruits displayed the lowest levels of 
triadimefon accumulation. Furthermore, triadimefon was found to have an impact 
on chlorophyll content, root activity, as well as the activity of superoxide 
dismutase and catalase in Pak choi, indicating its potential as a plant growth 
regulator. These aforementioned studies provide novel insights for the safe and 
efficient application of triadimefon in the production of Pak choi, cucumber, 
and pepper.

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and maturation are fundamentally important for 
ribosome biogenesis, but the mechanisms in archaea, the third form of life, 
remains largely elusive. This study aimed to investigate the rRNA maturation 
process in Methanococcus maripaludis, a representative archaeon lacking known 
3'-5' exonucleases. Through cleavage site identification and enzymatic assays, 
the splicing endonuclease EndA was determined to process the bulge-helix-bulge 
(BHB) motifs in 16S and 23S rRNA precursors. After splicing, the circular 
processing intermediates were formed and this was confirmed by quantitative 
RT-PCR and Northern blot. Ribonuclease assay revealed a specific cleavage at a 
10-nt A/U-rich motif at the mature 5' end of pre-16S rRNA, which linearized 
circular pre-16S rRNA intermediate. Further 3'-RACE and ribonuclease assays 
determined that the endonuclease Nob1 cleaved the 3' extension of pre-16S rRNA, 
and so generated the mature 3' end. Circularized RT-PCR (cRT-PCR) and 5'-RACE 
identified two cleavage sites near helix 1 at the 5' end of 23S rRNA, indicating 
that an RNA structure-based endonucleolytic processing linearized the circular 
pre-23S rRNA intermediate. In the maturation of pre-5S rRNA, multiple 
endonucleolytic processing sites were determined at the 10-nt A/U-rich motif in 
the leader and trailer sequence. This study demonstrates that endonucleolytic 
processing, particularly at the 10-nt A/U-rich motifs play an essential role in 
the pre-rRNA maturation of M. maripaludis, indicating diverse pathways of rRNA 
maturation in archaeal species.

INTRODUCTION: Neoantigen-based immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy 
for improving the life expectancy of cancer patients. This therapeutic approach 
heavily relies on accurate identification of cancer mutations using DNA 
sequencing (DNAseq) data. However, current workflows tend to provide a large 
number of neoantigen candidates, of which only a limited number elicit efficient 
and immunogenic T-cell responses suitable for downstream clinical evaluation. To 
overcome this limitation and increase the number of high-quality immunogenic 
neoantigens, we propose integrating RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data into the 
mutation identification step in the neoantigen prediction workflow.
METHODS: In this study, we characterize the mutation profiles identified from 
DNAseq and/or RNAseq data in tumor tissues of 25 patients with colorectal cancer 
(CRC). Immunogenicity was then validated by ELISpot assay using long synthesis 
peptides (sLP).
RESULTS: We detected only 22.4% of variants shared between the two methods. In 
contrast, RNAseq-derived variants displayed unique features of affinity and 
immunogenicity. We further established that neoantigen candidates identified by 
RNAseq data significantly increased the number of highly immunogenic neoantigens 
(confirmed by ELISpot) that would otherwise be overlooked if relying solely on 
DNAseq data.
DISCUSSION: This integrative approach holds great potential for improving the 
selection of neoantigens for personalized cancer immunotherapy, ultimately 
leading to enhanced treatment outcomes and improved survival rates for cancer 
patients.

Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to 
circadian rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. Most 
quantitative behavior studies have focused on short-timescale behaviors such as 
locomotion and grooming. Analysis of these data suggests there exists a 
hierarchy of timescales; however, the limited duration of these experiments 
prevents the investigation of the full temporal structure. To access longer 
timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila 
melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless 
arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to 
produce a full-body postural data set for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 
billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, 
proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore 
how the flies' behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We 
find distinct circadian patterns in all of our stereotyped behavior and also see 
changes in behavior over the course of the experiment as the flies weaken and 
die.

PURPOSE: To analyze causes and prognostic factors for death among Retinoblastoma 
(Rb) patients treated at a single specialized tertiary cancer center in Jordan.
METHODS: We reviewed the mortality causes for all Rb patients who have been 
treated at the King Hussein Cancer Center between 2003 and 2019 and were 
followed for at least 3 years after diagnosis. The main outcome measures 
included demographics, laterality, tumor stage, treatment modalities, 
metastasis, survival, and causes of death.
RESULTS: Twenty-four (5%) of the 478 patients died from retinoblastoma and 
5-year survival was 94%. The mean age at diagnosis was 15 months (median, 
18 months; range, 4-38 months); eight (33%) received diagnoses within the first 
year of life. Eleven (46%) were boys, 16 (67%) had bilateral disease, and 3 
(13%) had a positive family history. The stage for the worst eye was C for 1 
(4%) patient, D in 6 (25%) patients, and E (T3) in 15 (63%) patients. Two 
patients had extraocular Rb at diagnosis, and four of the patients who had 
intraocular Rb at diagnosis refused treatment and then came back with 
extraocular Rb. In total, extraocular disease was encountered in six eyes (six 
patients). After a 120-month median follow-up period, 24 patients (5%) died of 
second neoplasms (n = 3) or metastases (n = 21). Significant predictive factors 
for metastasis and death included advanced IIRC tumor stage (p < 0.0001), the 
presence of high-risk pathological features in the enucleated eyes (p = 0.013), 
parental refusal of the recommended primary treatment plan (p < 0.0001), and 
extraocular extension (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The 5-year survival rates of Rb patients in Jordan are as high as 
those in high-income countries. However, 5% are still dying from metastatic 
disease, prompting the need for awareness campaigns to educate the public about 
the high cure rates and to prevent treatment abandonment.

Unicellular euglyphid testate amoeba Paulinella micropora with filose 
pseudopodia secrete approximately 50 siliceous scales into the extracellular 
template-free space to construct a shell isomorphic to that of its mother cell. 
This shell-constructing behavior is analogous to building a house with bricks, 
and a complex mechanism is expected to be involved for a single-celled amoeba to 
achieve such a phenomenon; however, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 
shell and its assembly in P. micropora are still unknown. In this study, we 
aimed to clarify the positional relationship between the cytoplasmic and 
extracellular scales and the structure of the egg-shaped shell in P. micropora 
during shell construction using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy 
(FIB-SEM). 3D reconstruction revealed an extensive invasion of the 
electron-dense cytoplasm between the long sides of the positioned and stacked 
scales, which was predicted to be mediated by actin filament extension. To 
investigate the architecture of the shell of P. micropora, each scale was 
individually segmented, and the position of its centroid was plotted. The scales 
were arranged in a left-handed, single-circular ellipse in a twisted 
arrangement. In addition, we 3D printed individual scales and assembled them, 
revealing new features of the shell assembly mechanism of P. micropora. Our 
results indicate that the shell of P. micropora forms an egg shape by the 
regular stacking of precisely designed scales, and that the cytoskeleton is 
involved in the construction process.

BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom (UK) has used date of birth-based eligibility 
rules for live-attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination that have led to large 
differences in HZ vaccination coverage between individuals who differed in their 
age by merely a few days. Using this unique natural randomization, we have 
recently provided evidence from Welsh electronic health record data that HZ 
vaccination caused a reduction in new dementia diagnoses over a seven-year 
period. Based on this, we hypothesized that HZ vaccination may have slowed the 
dementia disease process more generally and, thus, already reduced deaths with 
dementia as their underlying cause even though the UK's HZ vaccination program 
commenced as recently as September 2013. Using country-wide death certificate 
data for England and Wales, this study, therefore, aimed to determine whether 
eligibility for HZ vaccination caused a reduction in deaths due to dementia over 
a nine-year follow-up period.
METHODS: Adults who had their 80th birthday shortly before September 1 2013 were 
ineligible for HZ vaccination in the UK's National Health Service and remained 
ineligible for life, whereas those who had their 80th birthday shortly after 
September 1 2013 (i.e., born on or after September 2 1933) were eligible for one 
year. Akin to a randomized trial, this date-of-birth threshold generated birth 
cohorts who are likely exchangeable in observed and unobserved characteristics 
except for a small difference in age and a large difference in HZ vaccination 
uptake. We used country-wide data from death certificates in England and Wales 
on underlying causes of death from September 1 2004 to August 31 2022 by ICD-10 
code and month of birth. Our analysis compared the percentage of the population 
with a death due to dementia among the month-of-birth cohorts around the 
September 2 1933 eligibility threshold using a regression discontinuity design. 
The primary analyses used the maximal available follow-up period of nine years.
RESULTS: The study population included 5,077,426 adults born between September 1 
1925 and August 31 1941 who were alive at the start of the HZ vaccination 
program. The month-of-birth cohorts around the September 2 1933 eligibility 
cutoff were well balanced in their occurrence of all-cause and cause-specific 
deaths (including deaths due to dementia) prior to the start of the vaccination 
program. We estimated that over a nine-year follow-up period, eligibility for HZ 
vaccination reduced the percentage of the population with a death due to 
dementia by 0.38 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.68, p=0.012) percentage points, 
corresponding to a relative reduction of 4.8%. As in our prior analysis, this 
effect was stronger among women (-0.62 [95% CI: -1.06 to -0.19] percentage 
points, p=0.004) than among men (-0.11 [95% CI: -0.51 to 0.28] percentage 
points, p=0.574). The reduction in deaths due to dementia likely resulted in an 
increase in remaining life expectancy because we found that HZ vaccination 
eligibility reduced all-cause mortality but had no effect on deaths not due to 
dementia. An effect on deaths due to dementia at the September 2 date-of-birth 
eligibility threshold existed only since the year in which the HZ vaccination 
program was implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HZ vaccination improved cognitive 
function at a fairly advanced stage of the dementia disease process because most 
individuals whose underlying cause of death was dementia during our nine-year 
follow-up period were likely already living with dementia at the start of the HZ 
vaccination program. By using a different population, type of data, and outcome 
than our prior study in Welsh electronic health record data, this analysis adds 
to the evidence base that HZ vaccination slows, or potentially even prevents, 
the natural history of dementia.

Over 35 years ago the cell biology community was introduced to connexins as the 
subunit employed to assemble semicrystalline clusters of intercellular channels 
that had been well described morphologically as gap junctions. The decade that 
followed would see knowledge of the unexpectedly large 21-member human connexin 
family grow to reflect unique and overlapping expression patterns in all organ 
systems. While connexin biology initially focused on their role in constructing 
highly regulated intercellular channels, this was destined to change as 
discoveries revealed that connexin hemichannels at the cell surface had novel 
roles in many cell types, especially when considering connexin pathologies. 
Acceptance of connexins as having bifunctional channel properties was initially 
met with some resistance, which has given way in recent years to the premise 
that connexins have multifunctional properties. Depending on the connexin 
isoform and cell of origin, connexins have wide-ranging half-lives that vary 
from a couple of hours to the life expectancy of the cell. Diversity in connexin 
channel characteristics and molecular properties were further revealed by X-ray 
crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM. New avenues have seen connexins or 
connexin fragments playing roles in cell adhesion, tunneling nanotubes, 
extracellular vesicles, mitochondrial membranes, transcription regulation, and 
in other emerging cellular functions. These discoveries were largely linked to 
Cx43, which is prominent in most human organs. Here, we will review the 
evolution of knowledge on connexin expression in human adults and more recent 
evidence linking connexins to a highly diverse array of cellular functions.

Comparison of young and old patients on peritoneal dialysis: A retrospective 
observational study.

BACKGROUND: With a global increase in life expectancy around the world, the 
burden of chronic kidney disease in the elderly is increasing. The number of 
elderly patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) is also increasing. There 
is still a perception that PD may be associated with an increased risk of 
complications in these elderly patients.
METHODS: A total of 311 patients, of which 103 PD patients aged 65 and over and 
208 PD patients under 65 years of age, were followed in a single center and 
evaluated, retrospectively. Demographic data of these patients, albumin values 
at first PD and during PD time, residual urine amount, number of peritonitis, 
time to the first peritonitis attack, PD endpoints, and mortality were compared.
RESULTS: Peritonitis and technique failure rates were lower in patients aged 65 
and over who applied PD (0.61-0.75, 6.8%-23.1%, respectively). There was no 
difference in peritonitis-free survival (p = 0.931). Need for help HR 2.569 
[95%CI 1.564-4.219] (p < 0.05), time to first peritonitis attack HR 0.983 [95%CI 
0.974-0.992] (p < 0.05), mean albumin value HR 0.191 [95%CI 0.088-0.413] 
(p < 0.05), urine output level HR 1.154 [95%CI 1.010-1.318] (p < 0.05) were 
factors affecting mortality.
CONCLUSION: Peritonitis and technical survival evaluations of elderly PD 
patients, other than mortality, were lower than younger PD patients. However, 
the need for help is one of the biggest obstacles to this method for the 
elderly. We believe that incentives in this regard will increase the number of 
elderly PD patients.

In today's global landscape, a paradigm shift from closed systems to open and 
digital networks is underway, with digital transformation and green growth 
permeating every facet of society, including healthcare. Therefore, our study 
attempts to explore the impact of digital transformation and green growth on the 
health outcomes of Asian economies. Employing the ARDL-PMG methodology, we delve 
into the long-run and short-run correlations between digital transformation, 
green growth, and health. Digital transformation is captured through patent 
technology, internet, and research and development. The findings report the 
significant and positive impact of digital transformation on health in the long 
and short run. Furthermore, the study reveals a substantial and favorable impact 
of green growth on health in both the short and long run. The findings of the 
study highlight the need for digital transformation and green growth 
particularly in the field of healthcare in order to improve quality of life and 
life expectancy.

The global rise in life expectancy transforms age structure consequently having 
impact to the sustainability of social protection systems and working life. This 
descriptive study aimed to illustrate the annual prevalence of sustainable 
working life across Swedish residential regions, and investigate differences 
between age groups, sex, or being identical or fraternal twin. The study sample 
included 81,231 twins with linkage to national register data on sickness 
absence, disability pension, unemployment, and residential regions. Regions were 
classified by Swedish municipalities into nine groups. Sustainable working life 
were then followed in 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013. Annual prevalence and 
Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) with log linear models for interaction 
test were used. Medium to large size municipalities (15-24%) had higher annual 
prevalence of sustainable working life than smaller municipalities (1-7%). Young 
adults in medium to large size municipalities had high annual prevalence of 
sustainable working life. We found no differences for sexes or being identical 
or fraternal twin. To conclude, annual prevalence of sustainable working life in 
1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013 differed by region being highest in medium to large 
size municipalities which may have importance for targeting policies, 
regulations, and practices in a region-specific way. Further studies on 
residential regions and sustainable working life would be merited to confirm 
associations and other influential factors.
