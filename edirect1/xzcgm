OBJECTIVES: An increased amount of functional dependence has been reported among 
residents living in nursing homes. Among others, feeding dependence is one of 
the most complex needs to satisfy: behind the attempt to personalise meals with 
individual preferences and clinical regimens, all residents require help at the 
same moment and for long periods of time, three or more times a day. With the 
intent of debating policy implications, the aims of this study were to advance 
the knowledge in the field of feeding dependence prevalence and predictors in 
Italy, a country where life expectancy is among the highest in the World.
METHOD: A large retrospective regionally-based study approaching all nursing 
homes (n = 105) was performed in 2014; all residents (n = 10,900) were eligible 
and those with a completed assessment recorded in the regional database and aged 
>65 years (n = 8875) were included.
RESULTS: 1839 residents (20.7%) were in total need of help in feeding on a daily 
basis. At the multilevel analysis, predictors were moderate/severe dementia (OR 
4.044, CI 95% 3.213-5.090); dysphagia (OR 4.003 CI 95% 3.155-5.079); pressure 
sores (OR 2.317 CI 95% 1.803-2.978); unintentional weigh loss (OR 2.197 CI 95% 
1.493-3.233); unsociability (OR 1.561 CI 95% 1.060-2.299); and clinical 
instability (OR 1.363 CI 95% 1.109-1.677).
CONCLUSIONS: The feeding dependence prevalence emerged seem to be unique 
compared to that documented at the international levels. Modifiable and 
unmodifiable predictors found require new policies regarding workforce 
skills-mix and shifts schedules; as well as alliances with families, 
associations and communities' stakeholders. According to the complexity of the 
resident profile emerged, staff education and training is also recommended.

Modeling of brain tumor growth simulator can estimate life expectancy for 
individual patients, estimate future effect of brain damages toward human senses 
and attitude and help in evaluating the efficiency of applied treatments. Brain 
tumor growth can be calculated based on Spatio-Temporal mathematical models 
namely the isotropic reaction-diffusion model and the anisotropic 
reaction-diffusion model where the second model produces more realistic results. 
Tumor normally grows in White Matter (WM) five times faster than in Gray Matter 
(GM) which makes brain tissues modeled as inhomogeneous-anisotropic material to 
assign different parameters to each tissue. In this research a comparative study 
between several tumor growth models has been achieved to clarify the effect of 
different algorithms on modeling tumor grow.

Increased life expectancy and broader restorative dental treatment alternatives 
for missing teeth have resulted in an increasing request of bone 
regeneration/augmentation procedures not only in healthy patients, but also in 
elderly and medically compromised ones. This is also combined with a growing 
demand for short implant loading protocols and for optimal aesthetic results. In 
order to meet these new dental needs, personalized treatment strategies tailored 
on each individual's characteristics and healing profile are warranted. Omics 
technologies are emerging as powerful tools to uncover molecules and signalling 
pathways involved in bone formation and osseointegration and to investigate 
differences in the molecular mechanisms between health and systemic diseases 
that could be targeted by future therapies. This review critically appraises the 
available knowledge on the application of omics technologies in the field of 
bone regeneration and osseointegration and explores their potential use for 
personalized medicine in the dento-maxillo-facial field.
SIGNIFICANCE: The use of omics in personalising dental maxillo-facial treatments 
emerges as a desirable diagnostic and treatment strategy. Omics represent, in 
fact, powerful tools not only to shade light on the cascade of events taking 
place during bone formation/osseointegration, but also to identify specific 
signalling pathways and molecules that can be targeted by future therapies with 
the aim to enhance clinical outcomes in patients with compromised healing 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) grafting is increasingly 
used in elderly patients without evidence of its risks or benefits compared with 
single internal mammary artery (SIMA) grafting.
METHODS: In all, 2,899 patients aged 70 years or older (855 [29.5%] underwent 
BIMA grafting) operated on from January 2015 to December 2016 and included in 
the prospective multicenter Outcome After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting 
(E-CABG) study were considered in this analysis.
RESULTS: One-to-one propensity matching resulted in 804 pairs with similar 
preoperative risk profile. Propensity score matched analysis showed that BIMA 
grafting was associated with a nonstatistically significant increased risk of 
inhospital death (2.7% versus 1.6%, p = 0.117). The BIMA grafting cohort had a 
significantly increased risk of any sternal wound infection (7.7% versus 5.1%, 
p = 0.031) as well as higher risk of deep sternal wound infection/mediastinitis 
(4.0% versus 2.2%, p = 0.048). The BIMA grafting cohort required more frequently 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.0% versus 0.1%, p = 0.02), and the 
intensive care unit stay (mean 3.6 versus 2.6 days, p < 0.001) and inhospital 
stay (mean 11.3 versus 10.0 days, p < 0.001) were significantly longer compared 
with the SIMA grafting cohort. Test for interaction showed that urgent operation 
in patients undergoing BIMA grafting was associated with higher risk of 
inhospital death (5.6% versus 1.3%, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting in elderly patients 
seems to be associated with a worse early outcome compared with SIMA grafting, 
particularly in patients undergoing urgent operation. Until more conclusive 
results are gathered, BIMA grafting should be reserved only for elderly patients 
with stable coronary artery disease, without significant baseline comorbidities 
and with long life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The timing of transplant listing after implantation of a left 
ventricular assist device (LVAD) remains uncertain, given high device 
complication rates and apparent stability of some LVAD-supported patients. This 
investigation quantifies the effect of delayed transplant listing and 
transplantation rates on medium-term survival and LVAD complications.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was used to simulate the effects of delaying 
initial transplant listing after LVAD implantation. Modeled parameters were 
derived from the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research file. When transplant 
listing was delayed and 5-year results were examined, fewer persons underwent 
transplantation (53% in base model vs 51% in 180-day-delay model) and the 
fraction of deaths while waiting increased (17% in base model vs 21% in 180-day 
delay model). Life expectancy changed minimally from the base model (3.50 y) 
when initial listing was delayed by 180 days (3.51 y).
CONCLUSIONS: Delaying initial transplant listing increased the likelihood of 
death while waiting for a transplant and decreased the likelihood of 
transplantation. In aggregate, life expectancy was unchanged by delays in 
listing. This study suggests that delaying transplant listing with the 
expectation of providing additional life expectancy is not likely with current 
LVAD technology.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the contemporary practice in 
the utilization of life expectancy (LE) calculations among urological 
clinicians.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Members of the Irish Society of Urology (ISU) and the 
British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) completed a questionnaire on 
LE utilization in urological practice.
RESULTS: The survey was delivered to 1251 clinicians and the response rate was 
17% (n = 208/1251). The majority (61%, n = 127) of urologists were aware of 
methods available for estimated LE calculation.Seventy-one percent (n = 148) had 
never utilized LE analysis in clinical practice and 81% (n = 170) routinely used 
'eyeballing' (empiric prediction) for estimating LE. Life expectancy tables were 
utilized infrequently (12%, n = 25) in making the decision for treatment in the 
setting of multi-disciplinary meetings.
CONCLUSIONS: LE is poorly integrated into treatment decision-making; not only 
for the management of urological patients but also in the multidisciplinary 
setting. Further education and awareness regarding the importance of LE is 
vital.

IMPORTANCE: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from clinical trials can provide 
valuable evidence to inform shared decision making, labeling claims, clinical 
guidelines, and health policy; however, the PRO content of clinical trial 
protocols is often suboptimal. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was published in 2013 and 
aims to improve the completeness of trial protocols by providing evidence-based 
recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed, but it does not 
provide PRO-specific guidance.
OBJECTIVE: To develop international, consensus-based, PRO-specific protocol 
guidance (the SPIRIT-PRO Extension).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The SPIRIT-PRO Extension was developed 
following the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) 
Network's methodological framework for guideline development. This included (1) 
a systematic review of existing PRO-specific protocol guidance to generate a 
list of potential PRO-specific protocol items (published in 2014); (2) 
refinements to the list and removal of duplicate items by the International 
Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) Protocol Checklist Taskforce; (3) 
an international stakeholder survey of clinical trial research personnel, PRO 
methodologists, health economists, psychometricians, patient advocates, funders, 
industry representatives, journal editors, policy makers, ethicists, and 
researchers responsible for evidence synthesis (distributed by 38 international 
partner organizations in October 2016); (4) an international Delphi exercise 
(n = 137 invited; October 2016 to February 2017); and (5) consensus meeting 
(n = 30 invited; May 2017). Prior to voting, consensus meeting participants were 
informed of the results of the Delphi exercise and given data from structured 
reviews evaluating the PRO protocol content of 3 defined samples of trial 
protocols.
RESULTS: The systematic review identified 162 PRO-specific protocol 
recommendations from 54 sources. The ISOQOL Taskforce (n = 21) reduced this to 
56 items, which were considered by 138 international stakeholder survey 
participants and 99 Delphi panelists. The final wording of the SPIRIT-PRO 
Extension was agreed on at a consensus meeting (n = 29 participants) and 
reviewed by external group of experts during a consultation period. Eleven 
extensions and 5 elaborations to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist were recommended for 
inclusion in clinical trial protocols in which PROs are a primary or key 
secondary outcome. Extension items focused on PRO-specific issues relating to 
the trial rationale, objectives, eligibility criteria, concepts used to evaluate 
the intervention, time points for assessment, PRO instrument selection and 
measurement properties, data collection plan, translation to other languages, 
proxy completion, strategies to minimize missing data, and whether PRO data will 
be monitored during the study to inform clinical care.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The SPIRIT-PRO guidelines provide recommendations for 
items that should be addressed and included in clinical trial protocols in which 
PROs are a primary or key secondary outcome. Improved design of clinical trials 
including PROs could help ensure high-quality data that may inform 
patient-centered care.

Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is commonly focused on 
providing individuals at high predicted CVD risk with preventive medication. 
Whereas CVD risk increases rapidly with age, current risk-based selection of 
individuals mainly targets the elderly. However, the lifelong (preventable) 
consequences of CVD events may be larger in younger individuals. The purpose of 
this paper is to investigate if health benefits from preventive treatment may 
increase when the selection strategy is further optimised. Methods Data from 
three Dutch cohorts were combined ( n = 47469, men:women 1:1.92) and classified 
into subgroups based on age and gender. The Framingham global risk score was 
used to estimate 10-year CVD risk. The associated lifelong burden of CVD events 
according to this 10-year CVD risk was expressed as quality-adjusted life years 
lost. Based on this approach, the additional health benefits from preventive 
treatment, reducing this 10-year CVD risk, from selecting individuals based on 
their expected CVD burden rather than their expected CVD risk were estimated. 
These benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years gained over 
lifetime. Results When using the current selection strategy (10% risk 
threshold), 32% of the individuals were selected for preventive treatment. When 
the same proportion was selected based on burden, more younger and fewer older 
individuals would receive treatment. Across all individuals, the gain in 
quality-adjusted life years was 217 between the two strategies, over a 10-year 
time horizon. In addition, when combining the strategies 5% extra eligible 
individuals were selected resulting in a gain of 628 quality-adjusted life 
years. Conclusion Improvement of the selection approach of individuals can help 
to reduce further the CVD burden. Selecting individuals for preventive treatment 
based on their expected CVD burden will provide more younger and fewer older 
individuals with treatment, and will reduce the overall CVD burden.

Nonenzymatic RNA primer extension by activated mononucleotides has long served 
as a model for the study of prebiotic RNA copying. We have recently shown that 
the rate of primer extension is greatly enhanced by the formation of an 
imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide between the incoming monomer and a second, 
downstream activated monomer. However, the rate of primer extension is further 
enhanced if the downstream monomer is replaced by an activated oligonucleotide. 
Even an unactivated downstream oligonucleotide provides a modest enhancement in 
the rate of reaction of a primer with a single activated monomer. Here we study 
the mechanism of these effects through crystallographic studies of RNA complexes 
with the recently synthesized nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, guanosine 
5'-(4-methylimidazolyl)-phosphonate (ICG). ICG mimics 2-methylimidazole 
activated guanosine-5'-phosphate (2-MeImpG), a commonly used substrate in 
nonenzymatic primer extension experiments. We present crystal structures of 
primer-template complexes with either one or two ICG residues bound downstream 
of a primer. In both cases, the aryl-phosphonate moiety of the ICG adjacent to 
the primer is disordered. To investigate the effect of a downstream 
oligonucleotide, we transcribed a short RNA oligonucleotide with either a 5'-ICG 
residue, a 5'-phosphate or a 5'-hydroxyl. We then determined crystal structures 
of primer-template complexes with a bound ICG monomer sandwiched between the 
primer and each of the three downstream oligonucleotides. Surprisingly, all 
three oligonucleotides rigidify the ICG monomer conformation and position it for 
attack by the primer 3'-hydroxyl. Furthermore, when GpppG, an analog of the 
imidazolium-bridged intermediate, is sandwiched between an upstream primer and a 
downstream helper oligonucleotide, or covalently linked to the 5'-end of the 
downstream oligonucleotide, the complex is better preorganized for primer 
extension than in the absence of a downstream oligonucleotide. Our results 
suggest that a downstream helper oligonucleotide contributes to the catalysis of 
primer extension by favoring a reactive conformation of the 
primer-template-intermediate complex.

The objective was to estimate the burden of disease from lower limb amputations 
attributable to diabetes mellitus in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from 2008 to 
2013. A descriptive epidemiological study was performed by calculating 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Burden of disease was high, more than 
8,000 DALY in men and women. Disability accounted for 93% of DALY and mortality 
for 7.5%. The burden in men was 5,580.6 DALY, almost double that in women 
(2,894.8), and the share of the years lost due to disability (YLD) component in 
men pushed this rate to 67.6% of total DALY. Men live longer following 
amputation, so they lose more years of healthy life (65.8%), while mortality is 
higher in women (61%). DALY rates were not distributed homogeneously across the 
state. The intensification of evaluation, planning, and development of 
cost-effective strategies for prevention and health education for diabetic foot 
should be oriented according to higher male vulnerability.

descritivo, utilizando-se o cálculo de anos de vida perdidos ajustados por 
incapacidade (DALY - disability-adjusted life years). A carga da doença foi 
alta, mais de 8 mil DALY, distribuídos entre homens e mulheres. A incapacidade 
respondeu por 93% do DALY e a mortalidade por 7,5%. A carga dos homens foi 
5.580,6 DALY, praticamente o dobro das mulheres (2.894,8), sendo que a 
participação do componente anos de vida saudável perdidos em virtude de 
incapacidade (YLD - years lost due to disability) dos homens impulsionou esta 
taxa para 67,6% do total do DALY. Os homens vivem mais tempo com a amputação, 
por isto perdem mais anos de vida sadia (65,8%), e a mortalidade é maior entre 
as mulheres (61%). As distribuições das taxas de DALY no estado não mostraram 
distribuição homogênea. A intensificação de avaliação, planejamento e 
desenvolvimento de estratégias custo-efetivas para a prevenção e educação em 
saúde para o pé diabético deve ser considera a partir da maior vulnerabilidade 
masculina.

BACKGROUND: Continued racial/ethnic health disparities were recently described 
as "the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time." Although the 
2014 US Affordable Care Act-mandated national insurance coverage expansion has 
led to significant improvements in health care coverage and access, its effects 
on life expectancy are not yet known. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), 
the largest US integrated health care system, has a sustained commitment to 
health equity that addresses all 3 stages of health disparities research: 
detection, understanding determinants, and reduction or elimination. Despite 
this, racial disparities still exist in the VHA across a wide range of clinical 
areas and service types.
OBJECTIVES: To inform the health equity research agenda, we synthesized evidence 
on racial/ethnic mortality disparities in the VHA.
SEARCH METHODS: Our research librarian searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central 
Registry of Controlled Trials from October 2006 through February 2017 using 
terms for racial groups and disparities.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they compared mortality between any 
racial/ethnic minority and nonminority veteran groups or between different 
minority groups in the VHA (PROSPERO# CRD42015015974). We made study selection 
decisions on the basis of prespecified eligibility criteria. They were first 
made by 1 reviewer and checked by a second and disagreements were resolved by 
consensus (sequential review).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers sequentially abstracted data on 
prespecified population, outcome, setting, and study design characteristics. Two 
reviewers sequentially graded the strength of evidence using prespecified 
criteria on the basis of 5 key domains: study limitations (study design and 
internal validity), consistency, directness, precision of the evidence, and 
reporting biases. We synthesized the evidence qualitatively by grouping studies 
first by racial/ethnic minority group and then by clinical area. For areas with 
multiple studies in the same population and outcome, we pooled their reported 
hazard ratios (HRs) using random effects models (StatsDirect version 2.8.0; 
StatsDirect Ltd., Altrincham, England). We created an evidence map using a 
bubble plot format to represent the evidence base in 5 dimensions: odds ratio or 
HR of mortality for racial/ethnic minority group versus Whites, clinical area, 
strength of evidence, statistical significance, and racial group.
MAIN RESULTS: From 2840 citations, we included 25 studies. Studies were large 
(n ≥ 10 000) and involved nationally representative cohorts, and the majority 
were of fair quality. Most studies compared mortality between Black and White 
veterans and found similar or lower mortality for Black veterans. However, we 
found modest mortality disparities (HR or OR = 1.07, 1.52) for Black veterans 
with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, colon cancer, diabetes, HIV, rectal cancer, 
or stroke; for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans undergoing noncardiac 
major surgery; and for Hispanic veterans with HIV or traumatic brain injury 
(most low strength).
AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Although the VHA's equal access health care system has 
reduced many racial/ethnic mortality disparities present in the private sector, 
our review identified mortality disparities that have persisted mainly for Black 
veterans in several clinical areas. However, because most mortality disparities 
were supported by single studies with imprecise findings, we could not draw 
strong conclusions about this evidence. More disparities research is needed for 
American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and Hispanic veterans overall and for 
more of the largest life expectancy gaps. Public Health Implications. Because of 
the relatively high prevalence of diabetes in Black veterans, further research 
to better understand and reduce this mortality disparity may be prioritized as 
having the greatest potential impact. However, other mortality disparities 
affect thousands of veterans and cannot be ignored.

A facile label free, ultrasensitive platform for a rapid detection of chronic 
kidney disease has been fabricated. Early intervention in patients with chronic 
kidney disease has the potential to delay, or even prevent, the development of 
end stage renal disease and complications, leading to a marked impact on life 
expectancy and quality of life. Thus, a potable electrochemical diagnostic 
biosensor has become an attractive option as electrochemical analysis is 
feasible to use for on-site detection of samples. In human, Cystatin C present 
in human body fluids is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but reabsorbed and 
catabolised by the renal tubules. Trace detectable amount is eliminated in 
urine, giving this molecular marker an edge over serum creatinine's 
disadvantages. A carboxyl functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes screen 
printed electrode was immobilized with papain (cysteine protease) where amino 
group of papain covalently bound carboxyl group on electrode surface by EDC 
(1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) 
chemistry. The modifications on sensor surface were characterized by field 
emission scanning electron microscopy. Interaction between papain and chronic 
kidney disease specific biomarker, Cystatin C was detected by cyclic voltammetry 
and differential pulse voltammetry within 10min. The sensor is highly specific 
to Cystatin C and showed negligible response to non-specific macromolecules 
present in urine. The sensitivity of the sensor was 1583.49µAcm-2µg-1 and lower 
limit of detection of Cystatin C was found 0.58ngL-1 which presents as a 
promising platform for designing potable kidney disease detector.

The present study modeled the effect of oregano essential oil, as an 
antimicrobial agent, on the shelf-life of vacuum-packed cooked sliced ham, based 
on the growth of lactic acid bacteria natural microbiota under isothermal 
conditions. The bacterial growth in ham without oregano essential oil (control) 
and with 0.4% oregano essential oil (v/w) was evaluated at five different 
temperatures (6, 12, 15, 20 and 25°C). Baranyi and Roberts, and modified 
Gompertz primary models were fitted to microbial growth curves. Square Root and 
Exponential secondary models were fitted to μmax parameter data. The addition of 
oregano essential oil increased lag phase, decreased growth rates and extended 
shelf-life of ham for all temperatures (at 6°C extended for, at least, 30days 
when compared to control). Statistical indexes showed that Baranyi and Roberts, 
and Exponential were the primary and secondary models, respectively, that better 
fit to the data. Thus, oregano essential oil showed a good antimicrobial effect 
and extended the ham shelf-life.

Global burden of disease estimates reveal that people in Nigeria are living 
shorter lifespan than the regional or global average life expectancy. Ambient 
air pollution is a top risk factor responsible for the reduced longevity. But, 
the magnitude of the loss or the gains in longevity accruing from the pollution 
reductions, which are capable of driving mitigation interventions in Nigeria, 
remain unknown. Thus, we estimate the loss, and the gains in longevity resulting 
from ambient PM2.5 pollution reductions at the local sub-national level using 
life table approach. Surface average PM2.5 concentration datasets covering 
Nigeria with spatial resolution of ∼1 km were obtained from the global gridded 
concentration fields, and combined with ∼1 km gridded population of the world 
(GPWv4), and global administrative unit layers (GAUL) for territorial boundaries 
classification. We estimate the loss or gains in longevity using 
population-weighted average pollution level and baseline mortality data for 
cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer in adults ≥25 years and for respiratory 
infection in children under 5. As at 2015, there are six "highly polluted", 
thirty "polluted" and one "moderately polluted" States in Nigeria. People 
residing in these States lose ∼3.8-4.0, 3.0-3.6 and 2.7 years of life 
expectancy, respectively, due to the pollution exposure. But, assuming 
interventions achieve global air quality guideline of 10 μg/m3, longevity would 
increase by 2.6-2.9, 1.9-2.5 and 1.6 years for people in the State-categories, 
respectively. The longevity gains are indeed high, but to achieve them, 
mitigation interventions should target emission sources having the highest 
population exposures.

Activation induced proliferation and clonal expansion of antigen specific 
lymphocytes is a hallmark of the adaptive immune response to pathogens. Recent 
studies identify two distinct control phases. In the first T and B lymphocytes 
integrate antigen and additional costimuli to motivate a programmed 
proliferative burst that ceases with a return to cell quiescence and eventual 
death. This proliferative burst is autonomously timed, ensuring an appropriate 
response magnitude whilst preventing uncontrolled expansion. This initial 
response is subject to further modification and extension by a range of signals 
that modify, expand and direct the emergence of a rich array of new cell types. 
Thus, both robust clonal expansion of a small number of antigen specific T 
cells, and the concurrent emergence of extensive cellular diversity, confers 
immunity to a vast array of different pathogens. The in vivo response to a given 
pathogen is made up by the sum of all responding clones and is reproducible and 
pathogen specific. Thus, a precise description of the regulatory principles 
governing lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation and survival is essential to 
a unified understanding of the immune system.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become ubiquitous in all areas of life 
sciences. The size and model complexity of MD simulations are rapidly growing 
along with increasing computing power and improved algorithms. This growth has 
led to the production of a large amount of simulation data that need to be 
filtered for relevant information to address specific biomedical and biochemical 
questions. One of the most relevant molecular properties that can be 
investigated by all-atom MD simulations is the time-dependent evolution of the 
complex noncovalent interaction networks governing such fundamental aspects as 
molecular recognition, binding strength, and mechanical and structural 
stability. Extracting, evaluating, and visualizing noncovalent interactions is a 
key task in the daily work of structural biologists. We have developed 
PyContact, an easy-to-use, highly flexible, and intuitive graphical user 
interface-based application, designed to provide a toolkit to investigate 
biomolecular interactions in MD trajectories. PyContact is designed to 
facilitate this task by enabling identification of relevant noncovalent 
interactions in a comprehensible manner. The implementation of PyContact as a 
standalone application enables rapid analysis and data visualization without any 
additional programming requirements, and also preserves full in-program 
customization and extension capabilities for advanced users. The statistical 
analysis representation is interactively combined with full mapping of the 
results on the molecular system through the synergistic connection between 
PyContact and VMD. We showcase the capabilities and scientific significance of 
PyContact by analyzing and visualizing in great detail the noncovalent 
interactions underlying the ion permeation pathway of the human P2X3 receptor. 
As a second application, we examine the protein-protein interaction network of 
the mechanically ultrastable cohesin-dockering complex.

The reduced number of animals in most wild felid populations implies a loss of 
genetic diversity. The death of juveniles, prior to the production of mature 
sperm, represents a loss of potential genetic contribution to future 
populations. Since 2011 mouse testicular organ culture has introduced an 
alternative mechanism to produce sperm in vitro from immature tissue. However, 
extension of this technology to other species has remained limited. We have used 
the domestic cat (Felis catus) as a model for wild felids to investigate 
spermatogenesis initiation and regulation, with the mouse serving as a control 
species. Testicular tissue fragments were cultured in control medium or medium 
supplemented with knockout serum replacement (KSR), AlbuMax, beta-estradiol or 
AlbuMax plus beta-estradiol. Contrary to expectations, and unlike results 
obtained in mouse controls, no germ cell differentiation could be detected. The 
only germ cells observed after six weeks of culture were spermatogonia 
regardless of the initial stage of tubule development in the donor tissue. 
Moreover, the number of spermatogonia decreased with time in culture in all 
media tested, especially in the medium supplemented with KSR, while AlbuMax had 
a slight protective effect. The combination of AlbuMax and beta-estradiol led to 
an increase in the area occupied by seminiferous tubules, and thus to an 
increase in total number of spermatogonial cells. Considering all the media 
combinations tested the stimulus for felid germ cell differentiation in this 
type of system seems to be different from the mouse. Studies using other 
triggers of differentiation and tissue survival factors should be performed to 
pursue this technology for the genetic diversity preservation in wild felids.
