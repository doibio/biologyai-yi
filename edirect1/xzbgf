been recognized, and exciting opportunities for drug-based therapy have emerged. 
Despite such a remarkable progress, MFS diagnosis remains difficult and aortic 
disease progression is very heterogeneous and clinical outcome is unpredictable. 
Ongoing research efforts are therefore exploiting animal models of MFS to 
identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, genetic, epigenetic and 
environmental modifiers and druggable biological targets.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer may reduce 
mortality, but it incurs considerable risk of over diagnosis and potential harm 
to quality of life. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PSA 
screening, with and without adjustment for quality of life, for the British 
Columbia (BC) population. We adapted an existing natural history model using BC 
incidence, treatment, cost and mortality patterns. The modeled mortality benefit 
of screening derives from a stage-shift mechanism, assuming mortality reduction 
consistent with the European Study of Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer. 
The model projected outcomes for 40-year-old men under 14 combinations of 
screening ages and frequencies. Cost and utility estimates were explored with 
deterministic sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness of 
regular screening ranged from $36,300/LYG, for screening every four years from 
ages 55 to 69 years, to $588,300/LYG, for screening every two years from ages 40 
to 74 years. The marginal benefits of increasing screening frequency to 2 years 
or starting screening at age 40 years were small and came at significant cost. 
After utility adjustment, all screening strategies resulted in a loss of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); however, this result was very sensitive to 
utility estimates. Plausible outcomes under a range of screening strategies 
inform discussion of prostate cancer screening policy in BC and similar 
jurisdictions. Screening may be cost-effective, but the sensitivity of results 
to utility values suggests individual preferences for quality versus quantity of 
life should be a key consideration.

The potential economic benefits of improved postfracture care: a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of a fracture liaison service in the US health-care 
system.

Fractures related to osteoporosis are associated with $20 billion in cost in the 
United States, with the majority of cost born by federal health-care programs, 
such as Medicare and Medicaid. Despite the proven fracture reduction benefits of 
several osteoporosis treatments, less than one-quarter of patients older than 65 
years of age who fracture receive such care. A postfracture liaison service 
(FLS) has been developed in many health systems but has not been widely 
implemented in the United States. We developed a Markov state-transition 
computer simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of an FLS using a 
health-care system perspective. Using the model, we projected the lifetime costs 
and benefits of FLS, with or without a bone mineral density test, in men and 
women who had experienced a hip fracture. We estimated the costs and benefits of 
an FLS, the probabilities of refracture while on osteoporosis treatment, as well 
as the utilities associated with various health states from published 
literature. We used multi-way sensitivity analyses to examine impact of 
uncertainty in input parameters on cost-effectiveness of FLS. The model 
estimates that an FLS would result in 153 fewer fractures (109 hip, 5 wrist, 21 
spine, 17 other), 37.43 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and save 
$66,879 compared with typical postfracture care per every 10,000 postfracture 
patients. Doubling the cost of the FLS resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $22,993 per QALY. The sensitivity analyses 
showed that results were robust to plausible ranges of input parameters; 
assuming the least favorable values of each of the major input parameters 
results in an ICER of $112,877 per QALY. An FLS targeting patients post-hip 
fracture should result in cost savings and reduced fractures under most 
scenarios.

Changes in weight loss-related quality of life among type 2 diabetes mellitus 
patients treated with dapagliflozin.

AIMS: This study evaluated change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
associated with ongoing weight change among patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) treated with dapagliflozin, a highly selective sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that lowers blood glucose by increasing 
urinary glucose excretion and is associated with body weight reductions.
METHODS: Patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin 
(MET) alone were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study with a 78-week extension to evaluate the effect of 
dapagliflozin + MET on body weight. Patients also completed the Study to Help 
Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes 
Weight Questionnaire-9 (SHIELD-WQ-9), a weight change-related HRQOL survey. 
Difference in proportions of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg + MET 
(n = 89) or placebo + MET (n = 91) who reported improvement in HRQOL was 
analysed with Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin patients had significantly greater weight loss than 
placebo patients over 102 weeks (p < 0.05). This corresponded to a numerically 
greater proportion of dapagliflozin-treated patients reporting ongoing weight 
loss and associated improvements in most HRQOL domains at three different 
evaluation points (weeks 24, 50 and 102) than placebo-treated patients. In a 
post-hoc analysis among patients who reported ongoing weight loss regardless of 
treatment arm, a significantly greater proportion of patients reporting weight 
loss versus weight gain reported improvements in physical health, self-esteem 
and overall HRQOL at weeks 24, 50 and 102.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin-induced weight loss was associated with improvement 
in overall HRQOL. Overall, ongoing weight loss was associated with improvements 
in several HRQOL domains compared with weight gain.

BACKGROUND: An updated economic evaluation was conducted to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of the four tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors 
adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab in active, progressive 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) where response to standard treatment has been 
inadequate.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant, recently 
published studies and the new trial data were synthesised, via a Bayesian 
network meta-analysis (NMA), to estimate the relative efficacy of the TNF-α 
inhibitors in terms of Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response, 
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores and Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI). A previously developed economic model was updated with the new 
meta-analysis results and current cost data. The model was adapted to delineate 
patients by PASI 50%, 75% and 90% response rates to differentiate between 
psoriasis outcomes.
RESULTS: All four licensed TNF-α inhibitors were significantly more effective 
than placebo in achieving PsARC response in patients with active PsA. 
Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab were significantly more effective than 
placebo in improving HAQ scores in patients who had achieved a PsARC response 
and in improving HAQ scores in PsARC non-responders. In an analysis using 1,000 
model simulations, on average etanercept was the most cost-effective treatment 
and, at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence willingness-to-pay 
threshold of between £20,000 to £30,000, etanercept is the preferred option.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic analysis agrees with the conclusions from the previous 
models, in that biologics are shown to be cost-effective for treating patients 
with active PsA compared with the conventional management strategy. In 
particular, etanercept is cost-effective compared with the other biologic 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: Iran has witnessed a substantial demographic and health transition, 
especially during the past 2 decades, which necessitates updated evidence-based 
policies at national and indeed at subnational scale. The National and 
Subnational Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (NASBOD) Study aims 
to provide the required evidence based on updated data sources available in Iran 
and novel methods partly adopted from Global Burden of Disease 2010.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims at explaining the motives behind the study, the 
design, the definitions, the metrics, and the challenges due to limitations in 
data availability.
METHODS: All available published and unpublished data sources will be used for 
estimating the burden of 291 diseases and 67 risk factors from 1990 to 2013 at 
national and subnational scale. Published data will be extracted through 
systematic review. Existing population-based data sources include: registries 
(death and cancer), Demographic and Health Surveys, National Health Surveys, and 
other population-based surveys such as Non_Communicable Diseases Surveillance 
Surveys. Covariates will be extracted from censuses and household expenditure 
surveys. Hospital records and outpatient data will be actively collected as two 
distinct projects. Due to lack of data points by year and province, statistical 
methods will be used to impute the lacking data points based on determined 
covariates. Two main models will be used for data imputation: Bayesian 
Autoregressive Multi-level models and Spatio-Temporal regression models. The 
results from all available models will be used in an Ensemble Model to obtain 
the final estimates. Five metrics will be used for estimating the burden: 
prevalence, death, Years of Life Lost due to premature death (YLL), Years of 
Life Lost due to Disability (YLD), and Disability-Adjusted Life Years Lost 
(DALY). Burden attributable to risk factors will be estimated through 
comparative risk assessment based on Population Attributable Fraction (PAF). 
Uncertainty Intervals (UIs) will be calculated and reported for all 
aforementioned metrics.
RESULTS: We will estimate trends in terms of prevalence, deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and 
DALYs for Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors province from 1990 to 2013.
CONCLUSION: Results of the present study will have implications for policy 
making as they address health gaps in Iranian population and their inequality 
between provinces.

BACKGROUND: It is expected that gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases inflict 
considerable burden on health systems in Iran; therefore, highlighting the 
significance of GI disorders across the other most burdensome diseases requires 
comprehensive assessment and regular updates of the statistics of such diseases 
in Iran.
OBJECTIVE: To assess in-depth sub-national estimates and trends for the 
incidence and prevalence of selected GI and liver diseases by age, gender and 
province over the period 1990 - 2013 in Iran.
METHODS: This is a national and sub-national burden of disease study on 21 GI 
diseases using all available data sources, including cancer registry, death 
registration system data, hospital data, and all available published data. 
Analyses will be performed separately by gender, age groups, year, and province. 
We will conduct 21 separated systematic reviews of the literature for 21 
diseases categories through searching online international electronic databases 
(i.e. the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine, Web of Science, 
and Scopus), Iranian search engines (i.e., IranMedex, Scientific Information 
Database (SID), and IRANDOC), and gray literature. We will search the medical 
literature published between January 1985 and December 2013. We generated two 
models, Spatio-temporal and Multilevel Autoregressive models, to estimate mean 
and uncertainty interval for the parameters of interest by gender, age, year, 
and province. The models will be informed by data of gender, age, year, and 
province. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods will be used to perform 
Bayesian inference in both modeling framework. All programs will be written in R 
statistical packages (version 3.0.1).
RESULTS: We will calculate and present 1990 to 2013 trends in terms of 
prevalence, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), years lived 
with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years DALYs for the 21 
selected GI diseases by gender, and province. We will also quantify the 
uncertainty interval for the estimates of interest.
CONCLUSION: Results of the present study will have implications for policy 
making; as they allow for understanding geographic distributions of the selected 
GI diseases, and identifying health disparities across provinces.

BACKGROUND: Focal therapy has been introduced for the treatment of localised 
prostate cancer (PCa). To provide the necessary data for consistent assessment, 
all focal therapy trials should be performed according to uniform, systematic 
pre- and post-treatment evaluation with well-defined end points and strict 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
OBJECTIVE: To obtain consensus on trial design for focal therapy in PCa.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A four-staged consensus project based on a 
modified Delphi process was conducted in which 48 experts in focal therapy of 
PCa participated. According to this formal consensus-building method, 
participants were asked to fill out an iterative sequence of questionnaires to 
collect data on trial design. Subsequently, a consensus meeting was held in 
which 13 panellists discussed acquired data, clarified the results, and defined 
the conclusions.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A multidisciplinary board from 
oncologic centres worldwide reached consensus on patient selection, pretreatment 
assessment, evaluation of outcome, and follow-up.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Inclusion criteria for candidates in focal therapy 
trials are patients with prostate-specific antigen <15 ng/ml, clinical stage 
T1c-T2a, Gleason score 3+3 or 3+4, life expectancy of >10 yr, and any prostate 
volume. The optimal biopsy strategy includes transrectal ultrasound-guided 
biopsies to be taken between 6 mo and 12 mo after treatment. The primary 
objective should be focal ablation of clinically significant disease with 
negative biopsies at 12 mo after treatment as the primary end point.
CONCLUSIONS: This consensus report provides a standard for designing a feasible 
focal therapy trial.
PATIENT SUMMARY: A variety of ablative technologies have been introduced and 
applied in a focal manner for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). In this 
consensus report, an international panel of experts in the field of PCa 
determined pre- and post-treatment work-up for focal therapy research.

Isolated populations have advantages for genetic studies of longevity from 
decreased haplotype diversity and long-range linkage disequilibrium. This 
permits smaller sample sizes without loss of power, among other utilities. 
Little is known about the genome of the Okinawans, a potential population 
isolate, recognized for longevity. Therefore, we assessed genetic diversity, 
structure, and admixture in Okinawans, and compared this with Caucasians, 
Chinese, Japanese, and Africans from HapMap II, genotyped on the same Affymetrix 
GeneChip Human Mapping 500K array. Principal component analysis, haplotype 
coverage, and linkage disequilibrium decay revealed a distinct Okinawan 
genome-more homogeneity, less haplotype diversity, and longer range linkage 
disequilibrium. Population structure and admixture analyses utilizing 52 global 
reference populations from the Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel 
demonstrated that Okinawans clustered almost exclusively with East Asians. 
Sibling relative risk (λs) analysis revealed that siblings of Okinawan 
centenarians have 3.11 times (females) and 3.77 times (males) more likelihood of 
centenarianism. These findings suggest that Okinawans are genetically distinct 
and share several characteristics of a population isolate, which are prone to 
develop extreme phenotypes (eg, longevity) from genetic drift, natural 
selection, and population bottlenecks. These data support further exploration of 
genetic influence on longevity in the Okinawans.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to probe into the changes in life 
expectancy associated with schooling years found by the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
METHODS: The study was based on the OECD database from the period 2000 to 2006. 
The data of thirty countries were constructed to allow comparisons over time and 
across these countries. Panel data analysis was used to estimate the 
relationship of national education, as defined as school years, with life 
expectancy. The control factors considered were numbers of practicing 
physicians, practicing nurses, hospital beds, and GDP.
RESULTS: We used fixed effects of both country and time through linear 
regression, the coefficient of school years in relation to life expectancy was 
statistically significant but negative. This finding is not in accord with the 
hypothesis that investing in human capital through education stimulates better 
health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Within developing countries, educational attainment is no longer 
keeping the same pace with life expectancy as before. Therefore, we suggest that 
an effective education policy should cover diverse topics, for example, 
balancing economic growth and mental hygiene, to improve national life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcome of 1,2-intercompartmental 
supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft for scaphoid nonunion 
(SN).
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients with SN and 
treated with 1,2-intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicled 
vascularized bone graft between 1997 and 2010. Functional measures, quality of 
life by Short Form SF-36 questionnaire, and analysis of risk factors were 
included.
RESULTS: Out of 39 patients who were eligible for the study, 11 were lost to 
follow-up. Out of the remaining 28 patients, union was achieved in 21 (75%). The 
mean length of follow-up was 63 ± 45 months. In hands with scaphoid union, the 
grip strength and the radioulnar active range of motion were less than the 
contralateral side but greater compared with patients with nonunion. Active 
extension-flexion was less compared with the noninjured hand but similar to 
patients with nonunion. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score 
decreased from 58 to 23 in dominant hands and from 46 to 13 in nondominant 
hands. Smoking was found to be a risk factor for nonunion. Patients with 
scaphoid union tended to higher scores in 8 domains of SF-36-Item Health Survey 
quality of life without significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of SN with 1,2-intercompartmental 
supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft provided a union rate 
comparable with other vascularized bone graft techniques. Previous scaphoid 
reconstruction with standard iliac crest bone graft was not associated with 
higher risk for secondary nonunion. There was an upward tendency seen in DASH 
score and quality of life after scaphoid union.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.

Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a major contributor to cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality and, given its association with age, the prevalence of 
CAVD is expected to continue to rise as global life expectancy increases. No 
drug strategies currently exist to prevent or treat CAVD. Given that valve 
replacement is the only available clinical option, patients often cope with a 
deteriorating quality of life until diminished valve function demands 
intervention. The recognition that CAVD results from active cellular mechanisms 
suggests that the underlying pathways might be targeted to treat the condition. 
However, no such therapeutic strategy has been successfully developed to date. 
One hope was that drugs already used to treat vascular complications might also 
improve CAVD outcomes, but the mechanisms of CAVD progression and the desired 
therapeutic outcomes are often different from those of vascular diseases. 
Therefore, we discuss the benchmarks that must be met by a CAVD treatment 
approach, and highlight advances in the understanding of CAVD mechanisms to 
identify potential novel therapeutic targets.

195, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

For most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a kidney transplant is 
the best treatment option. Compared with dialysis, a successful kidney 
transplant is associated with increased life expectancy and improved quality of 
life; a living donor transplant is associated with better long-term results than 
a deceased donor transplant.

[Timing of reoperation of degenerated aortic and mitral bioprostheses].

Reoperative surgery for degenerated aortic and mitral valve bioprostheses has a 
considerable mortality. This study compares life expectancy, mode of failure and 
predictors for emergency reoperation and reoperative mortality between 
degenerated aortic and mitral bioprostheses. A total of 265 bioprosthetic valve 
patients, 172 aortic and 93 mitral patients, were followed to assess the time 
period between first and redo valve replacement. Mean life expectancy for aortic 
bioprostheses was 10.4 ± 4.3 (2 to 28.6) years, whereas it was 10.0 ± 3.7 (0.9 
to 20) years for mitral bioprostheses (group M). Emergency reoperation had to be 
performed in 31/172 group A (18 %) and 16/93 group M (17 %) patients. In group 
A, the reoperative mortality was 5.2 %; it was 1.4 % for elective and 22.6 % for 
emergency reoperation (p < 0.0001; OR = 20.3). Reoperative mortality in group M 
patients was 5.4 % and did not differ between elective and emergency surgery. 
Group A patients who died at reoperation had higher transvalvular gradients 
before the first operation (p = 0.007), received smaller sized bioprostheses (p 
= 0.03) and had a higher incidence of coronary artery disease (p = 0.001) and 
pulmonary artery hypertension (p = 0.009) acquired during the interval. 
Endocarditis being the reason for primary surgery (p = 0.004), postoperative 
pneumonia after the first procedure (p = 0.005), pulmonary artery hypertension 
(p = 0.0004), later recurrence of symptoms of valve degeneration (p = 0.04), 
acute onset of bioprosthetic regurgitation (p = 0.00002) and a lower left 
ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.03) were risk factor for emergency surgery. 
There were no predictors of reoperative mortality identified in mitral valve 
patients. The life expectancy of aortic and mitral bioprostheses is acceptable 
even in a relatively young patient population (mean age 46 ± 13 in group A and 
45 ± 12 years in group M patients). Patients with degenerated aortic 
bioprostheses undergoing emergency reoperation have an extraordinary high 
reoperative mortality. They can be identified as patients who had a history of 
endocarditis and higher transvalvular gradients prior to the first operation, 
who received smaller sized bioprostheses and acquired coronary artery disease 
and pulmonary artery hypertension during the interval. Thus, emergency 
reoperation is preventable, increasing overall life expectancy of patients with 
bioprostheses. There were no risk factors for reoperative mortality identified 
in bioprosthetic mitral valve patients.

Luigi Bocconi, Via Roentgen 1, 20136, Milan, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess patient preferences for psoriasis treatment features and to 
investigate the heterogeneity of preferences among patients with different 
socio-demographic and disease-related characteristics.
METHODOLOGY: A discrete choice experiment was conducted on adult patients with 
moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis during a routine visit to their 
physician at 15 centres in Italy. We investigated the preferences of patients 
with respect to five treatment attributes: (1) mode and frequency of 
administration; (2) time to improvement; (3) time free of symptoms; (4) 
unintended life expectancy reduction resulting from treatment; and (5) monthly 
treatment cost. The heterogeneity of preferences was investigated in a mixed 
logit model with normally distributed random coefficients.
RESULTS: Overall, patients preferred the subcutaneous or intravenous route of 
administration (versus oral administration) and treatments that took less time 
to show improvement, ensured a longer time free of symptoms, involved a lesser 
reduction in life expectancy and had lower costs. There was significant 
preference heterogeneity for all attributes. The cost attribute was found to be 
significantly more important to females and to older patients (above 60 years of 
age). Older patients placed significantly greater emphasis on reduced life 
expectancy, whereas the time free of symptoms was significantly less important 
to them than to patients under 60 years of age. Patients with higher scores on 
the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) placed higher value on the time free 
of symptoms than those with lower DLQI scores. For the overall sample, the 
marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for a month's reduction in the time to 
improvement was <euro>32.4, whereas the WTP for one additional month without 
symptoms was significantly higher (<euro>68.2).
CONCLUSION: Patient-centred policies should consider the heterogeneity of 
patients' expectations to identify individualized treatments that would aid in 
optimizing patient satisfaction and wellbeing, as well as overall treatment 
effectiveness.

Delivering the evidence--skill mix and education for elder care.

Wolff MS(1), Schenkel AB, Allen KL.

Author information:

of Dentistry, New York, NY, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To review the current status of dental curricula on elder care, and 
the current curricula regarding elder care, and it's effect on altering 
practitioner behaviors while addressing the needs of a growing North American 
elder population.
BACKGROUND: An impending crisis is looming over the oral healthcare of our aging 
population. At the same moment that life expectancy is being extended through 
increasingly complex healthcare improvements, the numbers of trained dental 
providers capable and interested in delivering the needed care is failing to 
grow at an adequate rate.
DISCUSSION: The skills necessary to manage these increasingly complex patients 
require an interprofessional approach capable of delivering care to sicker 
patients, in a variety of living accommodations, while managing a variety of 
care givers. The dental skills necessary to treat these elderly are 
modifications of skills students routinely learn in dental school. As a matter 
of fact, the skills students acquire to treat an adult patient population may be 
contrary to the basic skills necessary to manage the elderly dependent adult 
patient. Teaching students the nuance differences needed to properly diagnose 
and care for this population is a difficult task that must be taught in a 
contextual environment.
CONCLUSION: Significant changes in the teaching of dental management of the 
elderly are critical within much of the education community. Just as teaching 
students to care for the pediatric population as general dentists, the clinical 
education must involve a sufficient number of quality experiences to address 
issues of both competency, that of the graduate to perform care independently, 
and attitudes, the actually willingness to treat the elderly.

The global burden of conduct disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder in 2010.

Australia; Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, The Park Centre for 
Mental Health, Wacol, Qld, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) is the first to 
include conduct disorder (CD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) for burden quantification.
METHOD: A previous systematic review pooled the available epidemiological data 
for CD and ADHD, and predicted prevalence by country, region, age and sex for 
each disorder. Prevalence was then multiplied by a disability weight to 
calculate years lived with disability (YLDs). As no evidence of deaths resulting 
directly from either CD or ADHD was found, no years of life lost (YLLs) were 
calculated. Therefore, the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) was 
equal to that of YLDs.
RESULTS: Globally, CD was responsible for 5.75 million YLDs/DALYs with ADHD 
responsible for a further 491,500. Collectively, CD and ADHD accounted for 0.80% 
of total global YLDs and 0.25% of total global DALYs. In terms of global DALYs, 
CD was the 72nd leading contributor and among the 15 leading causes in children 
aged 5-19 years. Between 1990 and 2010, global DALYs attributable to CD and ADHD 
remained stable after accounting for population growth and ageing.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of CD and ADHD is significant, particularly in 
male children. Appropriate allocation of resources to address the high morbidity 
associated with CD and ADHD is necessary to reduce global burden. However, 
burden estimation was limited by data lacking for all four epidemiological 
parameters and by methodological challenges in quantifying disability. Future 
studies need to address these limitations in order to increase the accuracy of 
burden quantification.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
depression. However, CBT is a complex therapy that requires highly trained and 
qualified practitioners, and its scalability is therefore limited by the costs 
of training and employing sufficient therapists to meet demand. Behavioural 
activation (BA) is a psychological treatment for depression that may be an 
effective alternative to CBT and, because it is simpler, might also be delivered 
by less highly trained and specialised mental health workers.
METHODS/DESIGN: COBRA is a two-arm, non-inferiority, patient-level randomised 
controlled trial, including clinical, economic, and process evaluations 
comparing CBT delivered by highly trained professional therapists to BA 
delivered by junior professional or para-professional mental health workers to 
establish whether the clinical effectiveness of BA is non-inferior to CBT and if 
BA is cost effective compared to CBT. Four hundred and forty patients with major 
depressive disorder will be recruited through screening in primary care. We will 
analyse for non-inferiority in per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. 
Our primary outcome will be severity of depression symptoms (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9) at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be clinically 
significant change and severity of depression at 18 months, and anxiety (General 
Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (Short-Form 
Health Survey-36) at 12 and 18 months. Our economic evaluation will take the 
United Kingdom National Health Service/Personal Social Services perspective to 
include costs of the interventions, health and social care services used, plus 
productivity losses. Cost-effectiveness will explored in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years using the EuroQol-5D measure of health-related 
quality of life.
DISCUSSION: The clinical and economic outcomes of this trial will provide the 
evidence to help policy makers, clinicians and guideline developers decide on 
the merits of including BA as a first-line treatment of depression.

AIMS: The (2'S,7'S)-O-(2-methylbutanoyl)-columbianetin (OMC) is a novel 
secondary metabolite extracted from Corydalis heterocarpa, which has long been 
used as a folk medicine for various inflammatory diseases in Korea. We examined 
the effect of OMC on allergic rhinitis (AR).
MAIN METHODS: We assessed the therapeutic effects and regulatory mechanisms of 
OMC on the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus A23187-stimulated mast cell 
line, HMC-1 cells and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR models.
KEY FINDINGS: OMC significantly decreased the releases of histamine and tryptase 
from stimulated HMC-1 cells. The degranulation process, characterized by 
morphological extension of the filopodia on the surface and membrane ruffling, 
was strongly induced in the stimulated-HMC-1 cell, however OMC suppressed the 
morphological changes in stimulated-HMC-1 cells. OMC reduced the production and 
mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. These inhibitory actions by OMC were 
dependent on the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear 
factor-κB, and caspapase-1 signaling pathways. In the AR animal model, the 
increased rub scores and AR biomarkers (histamine and IgE) in ovalbumin 
(OVA)-sensitized mice were significantly reduced by the administration of OMC. 
Furthermore, eosinophils and mast cell infiltrations in nasal mucosa tissue were 
also blocked through the regulation of macrophage-inflammatory protein and 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels.
SIGNIFICANCE: OMC showed the possibility to regulate AR in activated mast cells 
and OVA-induced AR models. Hence, we suggest that OMC is a powerful and feasible 
new agent to suppress AR.

Developing Effective and Efficient care pathways in chronic Pain: DEEP study 
protocol.

Richardson Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4AX, UK. Justin.durham@ncl.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: Pain affecting the face or mouth and lasting longer than three 
months ("chronic orofacial pain", COFP) is relatively common in the UK. This 
study aims to describe and model current care pathways for COFP patients, 
identify areas where current pathways could be modified, and model whether these 
changes would improve outcomes for patients and use resources more efficiently.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study takes a prospective operations research approach. A 
cohort of primary and secondary care COFP patients (n = 240) will be recruited 
at differing stages of their care in order to follow and analyse their journey 
through care. The cohort will be followed for two years with data collected at 
baseline 6, 12, 18, and 24 months on: 1) experiences of the care pathway and its 
impacts; 2) quality of life; 3) pain; 4) use of health services and costs 
incurred; 5) illness perceptions. Qualitative in-depth interviews will be used 
to collect data on patient experiences from a purposive sub-sample of the total 
cohort (n = 30) at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Four separate appraisal groups 
(public, patient, clincian, service manager/commissioning) will then be given 
data from the pathway analysis and asked to determine their priority areas for 
change. The proposals from appraisal groups will inform an economic modelling 
exercise. Findings from the economic modelling will be presented as incremental 
costs, Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and the incremental cost per QALY 
gained. At the end of the modelling a series of recommendations for service 
change will be available for implementation or further trial if necessary.
DISCUSSION: The recent white paper on health and the report from the NHS Forum 
identified chronic conditions as priority areas and whilst technology can 
improve outcomes, so can simple, appropriate and well-defined clinical care 
pathways. Understanding the opportunity cost related to care pathways benefits 
the wider NHS. This research develops a method to help design efficient systems 
built around one condition (COFP), but the principles should be applicable to a 
wide range of other chronic and long-term conditions.
