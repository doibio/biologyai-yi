OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluations conducted to inform healthcare resource 
allocation often rely on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to measure 
therapeutic benefit. However, QALYs, with underlying health utilities estimated 
using the EQ-5D or SF-36, may fail to capture the impact of disease for all 
patients. How well-being and heath utility differ across several common 
conditions was explored.
METHODS: This study examined eight diseases: arthritis, asthma, cancer, 
depression, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease and stroke. Health utilities 
for each disease were obtained from published literature. Other measures of 
disease burden, including physical functioning, cognitive functioning and 
physical activity, were estimated from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES). Group rankings by these measures were compared to 
rankings by health utility.
RESULTS: Health utilities were lowest for patients with depression (0.44), and 
highest for those with cancer (0.81). Physical functioning was most limited 
(higher score) among those with stroke (28.2) and had the least impact for 
cancer (24.4). Physical activity was most impacted by heart disease (27.3) and 
least impacted by depression (40.7). Cognitive functioning was lowest in stroke 
(41.6) and highest in asthma (52.0).
CONCLUSION: Differences in rankings of disease severity by metric indicate that 
the results of cost-utility analyses might be biased against treatments for 
certain diseases. As patient preferences for clinical outcomes vary, the full 
burden of disease should be considered in evaluations. Restricting access to 
treatments based on an incomplete estimate of burden could lead to misallocation 
of resources and a withholding of therapies that patients find valuable.

The significant increment in life expectancy, associated to the existence of 
high-performing older adults, and the appropriate diagnosis of early dementias, 
lead to an uncommon scenario, of healthy parents accompanying their children 
with Alzheimer's disease or another dementia to medical consultations. Here, we 
reported three peculiar clinical vignettes of patients diagnosed with a 
dementia, who were accompanied by healthy parents. This is a modern situation 
that tends to become more frequent, and must be properly discussed, since 
multidisciplinary care and specific training are necessary.

The choice between coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial revascularization in patients with 
left main disease (LMD) is controversial. There is general agreement that CABG 
is appropriate for all patients, and PCI is acceptable for those with 
low-to-intermediate anatomic complexity. However, there is uncertainty about the 
relative safety and efficacy of PCI in patients with more complex LMD and with 
comorbidities such as diabetes. No direct comparison trial has focused on 
revascularization in diabetic patients with LMD, and thus conclusions on the 
topic are subject to the limitations of subgroup analysis, as well as the 
heterogeneous exclusion criteria, and methodologies of individual trials. The 
available evidence suggests that among diabetics, CABG is superior in patients 
with LMD with SYNTAX (SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with 
TAXus and dardiac surgery) score greater than 33, distal bifurcation disease, or 
multivessel disease. PCI may be appropriate in those with less-extensive disease 
or those with limited life expectancy or high surgical risk.

BACKGROUND: The burden of type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) continues to rise 
in China. We analyzed time trends in DKD mortality and associations with age, 
period, and birth cohort from 1990 to 2019, made projections up to 2030, and 
examined the drivers of deaths from DKD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The number of DKD deaths in China from 1990 to 2019 was 
obtained from the GBD 2019. We used age-period-cohort modeling to estimate age, 
period, and cohort effects in DKD mortality between 1990 and 2019. We calculated 
net drift (overall annual percentage change), local drift (annual percentage 
change in each age group), longitudinal age curves (expected longitudinal 
age-specific rates), period, and cohort relative risks. We used Bayesian 
age-period-cohort analysis with integrated nested Laplace approximations to 
project future age-specific DKD death cases from 2020 to 2030. We used a 
validated decomposition algorithm to attribute changes in DKD deaths to 
population growth, population aging, and epidemiologic changes from 1990 to 
2030. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized mortality rate of DKD in China was 
relatively stable, but the absolute number of DKD deaths showed a noticeable 
increasing trend. The overall annual percentage change (net drift) was -0.75% 
(95% confidence interval, CI: -0.93 to -0.57) for males and -1.90% (95% CI, 
-2.19 to -1.62) for females. The age-specific annual percentage changes (local 
drifts) were below zero in all age groups from 1990 to 2019 except for males 
aged above 65 to 69 years, and for females aged above 70 to 74 years. The risk 
of DKD deaths increased exponentially with age for both sexes after controlling 
for period deviations. The Bayesian age-period-cohort analysis projects that 
there would be 88,803 deaths from DKD in 2030, increased by 224.2% from 1990. 
Despite a decrease in age-specific DKD death rates, the reduction would be 
entirely offset by population aging.
CONCLUSIONS: Although China has made progress in reducing DKD deaths, 
demographic changes have entirely offset the progress. The burden of DKD deaths 
is likely to continue increasing. Our findings suggest that large-scale 
screening is imperative for DKD control and prevention, particularly for 
high-risk groups.

Synpolydactyly (SPD) is a hereditary congenital limb malformation with distinct 
syndactyly designated as SPD1, SPD2, and SPD3. SPD1 is caused by mutations of 
HOXD13, which is a homeobox transcription factor crucial for limb development. 
More than 143 SPD patients have been reported to carry HOXD13 mutations, but 
there is a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation. We report a novel missense 
mutation of c. 925A > T (p.I309F) in an individual with atypical synpolydactyly 
inherited from her father with mild clinodactyly and three other different 
alanine insertion mutations in HOXD13 identified by whole exome sequencing (WES) 
in 12 Chinese SPD families. Unlike polyalanine extension, which tends to form 
α-helix and causes protein aggregation in the cytoplasm as shown by molecular 
simulation and immunofluorescence, the c. 925A > T mutation impairs downstream 
transcription of EPHA7. We compiled literature findings and analyzed 
genotype-phenotype features in 173 SPD individuals of 53 families, including 12 
newly identified families. Among the HOXD13-related individuals, mutations were 
distributed in three regions: polyalanine, homeobox, and non-homeobox. 
Polyalanine extension was the most common variant (45%), followed by missense 
mutations (32%) mostly in the homeobox compared with the loss-of-function (LOF) 
variants more likely in non-homeobox. Furthermore, a more severe degree and 
classic SPD were associated with polyalanine mutations although missense 
variants were associated with brachydactyly and syndactyly in hands and feet and 
LOF variants with clinodactyly in hands. Our study broadens the HOXD13 mutation 
spectrum and reveals the profile of three different variants and their severity 
of SPD, the genotype-phenotype correlation related to the HOXD13 mutation site 
provides clinical insight, including for genetic counseling.

The therapeutic landscape for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved 
significantly with the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for 
therapeutic use. Most patients with optimal responses to TKIs can have a normal 
life expectancy. Treatment-free remission (TFR) after discontinuing TKI has 
increasingly become a new goal for CML treatment. However, TKI only "control" 
CML, and relapse after discontinuation has become a key factor hindering patient 
access to attempt TFR. In this study, we reviewed studies on TKI 
discontinuation, including both first and second-generation TKI. We also 
reviewed predictors of relapse, new monitoring methods, and strategies targeting 
leukemic stem cells.

Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and a 
major barrier to sustainable human development. The objective of this study was 
to evaluate the global, sex, age, region, and country-related cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) burden, as well as the trends, risk factors, and implications for 
the prevention of CVD. Methods: Detailed information from 1990 to 2017, 
including global, regional, and national rates of CVD, and 11 categories of 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were collected from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. The time-dependent change in the trends of 
CVD burdens was evaluated by annual percentage change. Results: More than 17 
million people died from CVD in 2017, which was approximately two times as many 
as cancer, and increased nearly 50% compared with 1990. Ischemic heart disease 
and stroke accounted for 85% of the total age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of 
CVD. The ASDR and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASYR) of CVD were 1.5 times 
greater in men compared with women. People over the age of 50 were especially at 
risk for developing CVD, with the number of cases and deaths in this age group 
accounting for more than 90% of all age groups. CVD mortality was related to 
regional economic development and the social demographic index. In regions with 
a high economic income or socio-demographic index, there was a greater decline 
in the ASDR of CVD. The ASDR of CVD in high SDI regions decreased more than 50% 
from 1990 to 2017. Tobacco use, diets low in whole grains, diets high in sodium, 
and high systolic blood pressure were the important risk factors related to CVD 
mortality. Conclusions: CVD remains a major cause of death and chronic 
disability in all regions of the world. Ischemic heart disease and stroke 
account for the majority of deaths related to CVD. Although the mortality rate 
for CVD has declined in recent years from a global perspective, the results of 
CVD data in 2017 suggest that the mortality and DALYs of CVD varied in different 
ages, sexes, and countries/regions around the world. Therefore, it is necessary 
to elucidate the specific characteristics of global CVD burden and establish 
more effective and targeted prevention strategies.

The life expectancy-economic growth nexus in Nigeria: the role of poverty 
reduction.

Lawanson OI(1), Umar DI(1).

Author information:

Health improvement is a crucial determinant of economic growth; however, the 
impact of health on economic growth is affected by the level of poverty in any 
nation. Previous studies have focused more on the health-growth nexus, but the 
role of poverty reduction and the threshold of health required to mitigate the 
effect of poverty on economic growth were missing. This paper, therefore, 
examined the life expectancy-growth nexus and the role of poverty reduction with 
the view to determine the contribution of health to growth and poverty reduction 
and the threshold of health required to mitigate the adverse effect of poverty 
on economic growth in Nigeria. Based on the endogenous growth theoretical 
approach, the link between life expectancy, poverty incidence, and economic 
growth was estimated using the fully modified ordinary least square method. 
Findings showed that health contributes positively to economic growth and also 
mitigates the adverse effect of poverty on economic growth in Nigeria. The study 
determined the minimum threshold of life expectancy of 64.4 years as a health 
improvement annual benchmark. Therefore, for Nigeria to achieve sustainable 
economic growth and significant poverty reduction, policies aimed at achieving 
the newly determined health improvement threshold from the current annual 
average of 47.8 years are fundamental.

PURPOSE: Patient care, newer immunosuppressive medications, and advances in 
surgical technique, have resulted in significant prolongation of survival after 
liver transplantation in recent years. However, as life expectancy increased and 
the early mortality rates have decreased, different problems have evolved due to 
chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The aim of the present study is to evaluate 
patients who were transplanted and then developed de novo malignancies, in terms 
of the type of malignancies and the follow-up period.
METHODS: The study was conducted on 2814 patients who received liver 
transplantation between 2008 and 2020 in Inonu University Liver Transplant 
Institute. In total, the data of 23 patients were evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: Non-melanoma skin cancer was the most common de novo malignancy 
(21.7%), followed by gynecological cancers (17.3%). The interval between the 
time of transplantation until the development of de novo malignancy was 36 
(6-75) months. The median follow-up period after the diagnoses of the de novo 
malignancies was 4.11 years. One, 3-, 5-year survival rates of patients after 
the diagnoses of de novo malignancies were 69.6%, 56.5%, and 41.9%; 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Non-melanotic skin cancers were the most common de novo cancers in 
liver transplant recipients. A strict surveillance program is very important in 
the follow-up of liver transplant recipients.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of alcohol disorders using lottery equivalent 
(LE) and willingness to pay (WTP) methods and compute the WTP for a QALY (WTP-Q) 
derived from these values.
METHODS: Two samples of 300 people valued nine states of alcohol misuse. LE and 
WTP were used in sample 1 and 2, respectively. The ability to discriminate 
between methods was tested. Regression models were performed to estimate the 
preference weights of dimensions. Several values of WTP-Q were obtained by 
combining the estimated values from both samples.
RESULTS: LE and WTP produce the same ranking of states but LE is more sensitive. 
The estimated impact of the nine states ranges between 0.91 and 0.22 QALYs, and 
the WTP for avoiding them ranges between €10,444 and €4132. WTP-Q varies between 
€11,473 and €19,092 when the mean values of the states are used. The WTP-Q tends 
to decrease with the severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although LE and WTP provide values for cost-utility and 
cost-benefit analyses, respectively, LE seems to be preferable for measuring the 
impact of alcohol disorders. As the lower sensitivity of WTP seems to explain a 
WTP-Q decrease with severity, more research is needed before recommending the 
use of different WTP-Q values.

BACKGROUND: Results from studies addressing age-related patterns of cancer care 
have found evidence of unjustified differences in management between younger and 
older patients.
METHODS: We examined associations between age and clinical presentation, 
management and mortality in patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) between 2002 and 2016. Analyses were adjusted for comorbidity and other 
factors that may have affected management decisions and outcomes.
RESULTS: The study population encompassed 40,026 patients with NSCLC. Stage at 
diagnosis did not differ between age groups ≤ 84. The diagnostic intensity was 
similar in age groups <80 years. In patients with stage IA-IIB disease and PS 
0-2, surgery was more common in the youngest age groups and decreased with 
increasing age, and was rarely performed in those ≥ 85 years. The use of 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) increased with age (≤69 years 5.4%; 
≥85 years 35.8%). In patients with stage IIIA disease and PS 0-2, concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy was more common in younger patients (≤69 years 55.3%; 
≥85 years 2.2%). In stage IA-IIIA disease, no major differences in 
treatment-related mortality was observed. In stage IIIB-IV and PS 0-2, 
chemotherapy was more common in patients <80 years. However, 58.1% of patients 
80-84 years and 30.3% ≥ 85 years received treatment. In stage IA-IIIA, overall 
and cause-specific survival decreased with increasing age. No age-differences in 
survival were observed in patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC.
CONCLUSION: Treatments were readily given to older patients with metastatic 
disease, but to a lesser degree to those with early stage disease. Significant 
differences in cause specific survival were observed in early, but not late 
stage disease. Our findings underscore the importance of individualized 
assessment of health status and life expectancy. Our results indicate that older 
patients with early stage lung cancer to a higher extent should be considered 
for curative treatment.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol-associated liver disease is the leading cause of liver 
transplantation in the western world. For these patients we calculated life 
expectancies both at time of transplant and several years later, stratified by 
key risk factors, and determined if survival has improved in recent years.
METHODS: Data on 14 962 patients with alcohol-associated liver disease who 
underwent liver transplantation in the MELD era (2002-2018) from the United 
States Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database were analyzed 
using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and life table methods.
RESULTS: Demographic and past medical history factors related to survival were 
patient age, presence of diabetes or severe hepatic encephalopathy, and length 
of hospital stay. Survival improved over the study period, at roughly 3% per 
calendar year during the first 5 years posttransplant and 1% per year 
thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in transplanted patients with alcohol-associated 
liver disease was much reduced from normal, and varied according to age, medical 
risk factors, and functional status. Survival improved modestly over the study 
period. Information on patient longevity can be helpful in making treatment 
decisions.

What, precisely, are we seeking to achieve in offering 'life-saving' treatment 
to patients with cancer? Research funding agencies and pharmaceutical industry 
media releases, and government cancer screening programs all promise that their 
cancer programs save lives. But everybody dies. The nature of life and death 
from cancer is explored philosophically in this essay, with particular reference 
to the quality of life, and its meaning, during the period of prolongation of 
survival by 'life-saving' cancer care.

BACKGROUND: The phase III KEYNOTE-604 study confirmed the benefit of 
pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of 
extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Taken into account the 
clinical benefits of pembrolizumab and its high cost, this study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line 
etoposide-platinum (EP) for patients with ES-SCLC from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost and quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) of pembrolizumab plus EP and placebo plus EP over a 10-year 
time horizon. Clinical efficacy and safety data were pooled from the KEYNOTE-604 
trial. Utilities were obtained from published resources. Costs were mainly 
collected from Medicare in 2020. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine 
the robustness of our model.
RESULTS: Adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line EP resulted in the better 
effectiveness than EP chemotherapy alone for ES-SCLC by 0.22 QALYs. 
Pembrolizumab plus EP was dominated economically by placebo plus EP, leading to 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $334,373/ QALY. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the uncertainty in model parameters exerted 
no substantial effect on our results. Probability sensitivity analysis indicated 
that probabilities for pembrolizumab plus EP being cost-effective within a wide 
range of willingness to pay were modest.
CONCLUSION: From the US payer perspective, the first-line treatment for ES-SCLC 
with pembrolizumab plus EP was not cost-effective compared with placebo plus EP. 
Although pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy was beneficial to the survival 
of ES-SCLC, price reduction may be the necessary to improve its 
cost-effectiveness.

and Social Justice, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO.

IMPORTANCE: Adults aging with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) 
continue to face barriers to participation in meaningful occupation; moreover, 
the increased life expectancy of adults with IDD intensifies the need for age- 
and environment-specific support.
OBJECTIVE: To map and categorize transdisciplinary literature on environmental 
modifications and supports for adults aging with IDD.
DATA SOURCES: Studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2019, 
identified through PubMed and Scopus. Study Selection and Data Collection: 
Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and contained information specific to 
occupational participation based on environmental modification (e.g., physical 
space, technology, universal design, type of living setting), social supports 
(e.g., family members, caretakers, peer groups, health care professionals, 
policies, organizational infrastructure), or both and adults age ≥35 yr with 
IDD.
FINDINGS: Eleven studies met the criteria for this scoping review. Thematic 
coding was used to examine the articles within one or more themes: definition of 
need, environmental risk and assessment, environmental setting, intervention and 
program planning, use of technology, and bureaucracy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This review highlights collective and individual 
outcomes in the areas of assessment, intervention, and advocacy. Further 
research is needed within the scope of occupational therapy and disability 
studies that examines environmental factors and participation outcomes in this 
population. What This Article Adds: The authors define the interconnectedness of 
adults aging with IDD and environmental factors, identify barriers to 
participation, and guide occupational therapy practitioners' logic on how to 
positively affect environmental change and supports through intervention.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of adjuvant systemic treatment has significantly 
improved recurrence-free survival in patients with resectable high-risk 
melanoma. Adjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted 
therapy, however, substantially impacts health care budgets, while the number of 
patients with melanoma who are treated in the adjuvant setting is still 
increasing. To evaluate the socioeconomic impact of the three adjuvant 
treatments, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was carried out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the three pivotal registration 
phase III clinical trials on the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected 
high-risk stage III in melanoma (KEYNOTE-054, CheckMate 238, and COMBI-AD). For 
this CEA, a Markov model with three health states (no evidence of disease, 
recurrent/progressive disease, and death) was applied. From a societal 
perspective, different adjuvant strategies were compared according to total 
costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. To evaluate model uncertainty, sensitivity analyses 
(deterministic and probabilistic) were carried out.
RESULTS: In the adjuvant setting, total costs (per patient) were €168 826 for 
nivolumab, €194 529 for pembrolizumab, and €211 110 for dabrafenib-trametinib. 
These costs were mainly determined by drug acquisition costs, whereas routine 
surveillance costs varied from €126 096 to €134 945. Compared with routine 
surveillance, LYs improved by approximately 1.41 for all therapies and QALYs 
improved by 2.02 for immune checkpoint inhibitors and 2.03 for targeted therapy. 
This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €21 153 (nivolumab), 
€33 878 (pembrolizumab), and €37 520 (dabrafenib-trametinib) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This CEA compared the three EMA-approved adjuvant systemic 
therapies for resected stage III melanoma. Adjuvant treatment with nivolumab was 
the most cost-effective, followed by pembrolizumab. Combination therapy with 
dabrafenib-trametinib was the least cost-effective. With the increasing number 
of patients with high-risk melanoma who will be treated with adjuvant treatment, 
there is an urgent need to reduce drug costs while developing better prognostic 
and predictive tools to identify patients who will benefit from adjuvant 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Despite their great disease burden, there have been few studies on 
the epidemiology of central nervous system tumours (CNSTs) in China. We used the 
latest data updated by GBD to analyse the trends of incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for CNSTs in China versus globally.
METHODS: Epidemiological data on CNSTs were extracted from GBD 2019. We used 
Joinpoint regression analysis to calculate the magnitude and direction of the 
trends and the age-period-cohort method to analyse the age, period, and cohort 
effects of the trend.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the 106.52% increase in Chinese incident cases was 
higher than the global increase (94.35%). The 67.32% increase in cancer deaths 
and 16.03% increase in DALYs were lower than the global increases (cancer death: 
76.36%; DALYs: 40.06%). The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) in China 
were higher than the global ASIRs, and the increase in China was higher than 
that globally. Although the age-standardized mortality rates and 
age-standardized DALY rates in China were higher, their increases in China were 
less than those globally. Both in China and globally, the number and incidence, 
mortality, and DALYs by age group showed a bimodal distribution (younger than 5 
years and older), and the peak in the older age group showed a backwards trend. 
The proportion of incident cases, cancer deaths, and DALYs also increased in the 
older age group. In the age-period-cohort model, the local drifts in the older 
age group were above zero.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of CNSTs is very serious in China, and we should pay 
attention to the key populations, early diagnosis technology, improvements in 
medical technology, and ways to reduce medical costs. We believe our results 
could help policymakers allocate resources efficiently to reduce the burden of 
CNSTs.

Acetylation and deacetylation of histones are key epigenetic mechanisms for gene 
regulation in response to environmental stimuli. RPD3 is a well-conserved class 
I histone deacetylase (HDAC) that is involved in diverse biological processes. 
Here, we investigated the roles of the Magnaporthe oryzae RPD3 (MoRPD3) gene, an 
ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpd3, during development and pathogenesis 
in the model plant-pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We demonstrated that 
the MoRPD3 gene is able to functionally complement the yeast Rpd3 deletion 
mutant despite the C-terminal extension of the MoRPD3 protein. MoRPD3 localizes 
primarily to the nuclei of vegetative hyphae, asexual spores, and invasive 
hyphae. Deletion of MoRPD3 appears to be lethal. Depletion of MoRPD3 transcripts 
via gene silencing (MoRPD3kd, where "kd" stands for "knockdown") has opposing 
effects on asexual and sexual reproduction. Although conidial germination and 
appressorium formation rates of the mutants were almost comparable to those of 
the wild type, in-depth analysis revealed that the appressoria of mutants are 
smaller than those of the wild type. Furthermore, the MoRPD3kd strain shows a 
significant reduction in pathogenicity, which can be attributed to the delay in 
appressorium-mediated penetration and impaired invasive growth. Interestingly, 
MoRPD3 does not regulate potassium transporters, as shown for Rpd3 of S. 
cerevisiae. However, it functioned in association with the target of rapamycin 
(TOR) kinase pathway, resulting in the dependency of appressorium formation on 
hydrophilic surfaces and on TOR's inhibition by MoRPD3. Taken together, our 
results uncovered distinct and evolutionarily conserved roles of MoRPD3 in 
regulating fungal reproduction, infection-specific development, and virulence. 
IMPORTANCE RPD3 is an evolutionarily conserved class I histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) that plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes. In filamentous 
fungal pathogens, abrogation of the gene encoding RPD3 results in either 
lethality or severe growth impairment, making subsequent genetic analyses 
challenging. Magnaporthe oryzae is a causal agent of rice blast disease, which 
is responsible for significant annual yield losses in rice production. Here, we 
characterized the RPD3 gene of M. oryzae (MoRPD3) in unprecedented detail using 
a gene-silencing approach. We provide evidence that MoRPD3 is a bona fide HDAC 
regulating fungal reproduction and pathogenic development by potentially being 
involved in the TOR-mediated signaling pathway. To the best of our knowledge, 
this work is the most comprehensive genetic dissection of RPD3 in filamentous 
fungal pathogens. Our work extends and deepens our understanding of how an 
epigenetic factor is implicated in the development and virulence of fungal 
pathogens of plants.

INTRODUCTION: Rapid increases in the trade of global red and processed meat 
impede international efforts toward sustainable diets by increasing meat 
consumption. However, little research has examined cross-country variations in 
diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) because of meat trade. We aimed to 
examine the impact of red and processed meat trade on diet-related NCDs and to 
identify which countries are particularly vulnerable to diet-related NCDs due to 
red and processed meat trade.
METHODS: By selecting 14 red meat and six processed meat items, we investigated 
bilateral meat trade flows across 154 countries. Then, we integrated health data 
and information on red and processed meat trade to quantify the country-specific 
burden of diet-related NCDs attributable to the meat trade using a comparative 
risk assessment framework.
RESULTS: Results show that global increases in red and processed meat trade 
contributed to the abrupt increase of diet-related NCDs, and the attributable 
burden of diet-related NCDs had large geographical variations among countries. 
We also identified responsible exporting countries that increase diet-related 
NCD risks in importing countries. Over the period from 1993 to 2018, island 
countries in the Caribbean and Oceania were particularly vulnerable to 
diet-related NCD incidents and mortality due to large meat imports. In addition, 
countries in Northern and Eastern Europe have exceedingly increased attributable 
death and disability-adjusted life year rates via meat imports.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that both exporters and importers must urgently 
undertake cross-sectoral actions to reduce the meat trade's health impacts. To 
prevent unintended health consequences due to red and processed meat trade, 
future interventions need to integrate health policies with agricultural and 
trade policies by cooperating with both responsible exporting and importing 
countries.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The elimination goal for leprosy as a public health 
problem at the national level was achieved in 2005 in India. However, the number 
of new cases reporting annually remained nearly the same during the last 10-15 
years. Moreover, a substantial number of these new cases reported disabilities 
for the first time. Therefore, besides multidrug therapy (MDT), newer strategies 
with focus on effectively decreasing the number of new cases, optimizing the 
treatment of detected cases, averting disabilities and arresting the 
transmission of the disease are required. So the objective of this study was to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) vaccine 
implementation in National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) for newly 
diagnosed leprosy patients as well as their contacts to arrest/decrease the 
transmission and occurrence of new cases.
METHODS: This was a model-based estimation of incremental costs, total 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, new cases averted, deaths averted, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact of the vaccination 
intervention. This model included the addition of MIP treatment intervention to 
the newly detected leprosy patients as well as vaccination with MIP to their 
contacts.
RESULTS: Using the societal perspective, discounted ICER was estimated to be 
₹73,790 per QALY gained over a five-year time period. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) was assessed by varying the values of input parameters. Majority 
(96%) of simulations fell in North East quadrant of cost-effectiveness plane, 
which were all below the willingness to pay threshold.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of MIP vaccination in the NLEP 
appears to be a cost-effective strategy for India. Significant health gains were 
reduction in the number of new leprosy cases, decreased incidence and severity 
of reactions during treatment, and after release from treatment, prevention of 
disabilities, thus reducing the cost as well as stigma of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting neurological recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is 
challenging. Using topological data analysis, we have previously shown that mean
