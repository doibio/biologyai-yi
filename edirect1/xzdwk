BACKGROUND: The rate of events such as recurrent heart failure (HF) 
hospitalization and death are known to dramatically increase directly after HF 
hospitalization. Furthermore, the number of HF hospitalizations is associated 
with irreversible long-term disease progression, which is in turn associated 
with increased event rates. However, cost-effectiveness models of HF treatments 
commonly fail to capture both the short- and long-term association between HF 
hospitalization and events.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a decision-analytic model that 
reflects the short- and long-term association between HF hospitalization and 
event rates. Furthermore, we assess the impact of omitting these associations.
METHODS: We developed a life-time Markov cohort model to evaluate HF treatments, 
and modeled the short-term impact of HF hospitalization on event rates via a 
sequence of tunnel states, with transition probabilities following a parametric 
survival curve. The corresponding long-term impact was modeled via hazard ratios 
per HF hospitalization. We obtained baseline event rates and utilities from 
published literature. Subsequently, we assessed, for a hypothetical HF 
treatment, how omitting the modeled associations (through a simple two-state 
model) affects incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: We developed a model that incorporates both short- and long-term 
impacts of HF hospitalizations. Based on an assumed treatment effect of a 20% 
risk reduction for HF hospitalization (and associated reductions in all-cause 
mortality of 15%), omitting the short-term, the long-term, or both associations 
resulted in a 5%, 1%, and 22% decrease in QALYs gained, respectively.
CONCLUSION: For both modeling components, i.e., the short- and long-term 
implications of HF hospitalization, the impact on incremental outcomes 
associated with treatment was substantial. Considering these aspects as proposed 
within this modeling approach better reflects the natural course of this 
progressive condition and will enhance the evaluation of future HF treatments.

It is well established that many common skin diseases may result in mild to 
severe cosmetic disfigurement. Similarly, patients with these conditions have an 
increased risk for depression, anxiety, feelings of stigmatization, and 
self-harm ideation. There also is an increased risk for hospitalizations for 
mental health in patients with acne, rosacea, and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). 
Cutaneous body image (CBI) is an individual's mental perception of the condition 
of their hair, nails, and skin. A positive CBI may be related to increased 
quality of life, and a negative CBI may be associated with poorer outcomes, such 
as insomnia, worsened overall morbidity of dermatologic disease, and intentional 
self-injury. For military service members who face a multitude of operational 
demands and who must be ready to "fight tonight," a holistic approach that 
addresses both physical and mental health is critical. Military dermatologists 
have the tools and expertise available to treat cutaneous disease, which by 
extension may improve body image, quality of life, and morale in military 
service members. Herein, we discuss how dermatologic treatments that often are 
thought of as nonessential cosmetic therapies can positively influence CBI and 
thus increase military readiness.

OBJECTIVES: Despite a growing prevalence of respiratory diseases in recent 
decades in China, limited evidence is available on the health and economic 
burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We estimated the 20-year 
health and economic burden of COPD in China from 2020 to 2039.
METHODS: We created a probabilistic dynamic open-cohort Markov model of COPD for 
the Chinese population aged ≥40 years. Projections of population growth and 
urbanization rates were obtained from the United Nations Population Division. 
Other parameter inputs including smoking prevalence, COPD prevalence and 
severity distributions, disease-related costs, and utility weights were obtained 
from the most recent published literature. We modeled number of COPD patients, 
excess mortality due to COPD, exacerbations, COPD-attributable losses of 
quality-adjusted life-years, and direct and indirect COPD costs over the 20 
years.
RESULTS: The number of COPD patients was projected to increase from 88.3 million 
in 2020 to 103.3 million in 2039. The projected total losses of quality-adjusted 
life-years and the excess mortality due to COPD were, respectively, estimated to 
be 253.6 million and 3.9 million over the 20 years. The projected 20-year total 
discounted direct and indirect costs of COPD were, respectively, $3.1 trillion 
and $360.5 billion. The projected health and economic burden was higher in males 
and urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD is projected to inflict a substantial burden to the society 
and the health care system in China. Effective strategies for prevention and 
early management of COPD are needed to mitigate the forthcoming disease burden.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is the most effective strategy to protect individuals 
with haematologic malignancies against severe COVID-19, while eliciting limited 
vaccine responses. We characterized the humoral responses following 3 mo after 
mRNA-based vaccines in individuals at different plasma-cell disease stages: 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple 
myeloma (SMM), and multiple myeloma on first-line therapy (MM), compared with a 
healthy population. Plasma samples from uninfected MM patients showed lower 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels and neutralization capacity compared with 
MGUS, SMM, and healthy individuals. Importantly, COVID-19 recovered MM 
individuals presented significantly higher plasma neutralization capacity 
compared with their uninfected counterparts, highlighting that hybrid immunity 
elicit stronger immunity even in this immunocompromised population. No 
differences in the vaccine-induced humoral responses were observed between 
uninfected MGUS, SMM and healthy individuals. In conclusion, MGUS and SMM 
patients could be SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated following the vaccine recommendations 
for the general population, whereas a tailored monitoring of the vaccine-induced 
immune responses should be considered in uninfected MM patients.

BACKGROUND: Population genomic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) 
in unselected individuals can prevent premature cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of population-wide FH 
genomic screening versus no genomic screening.
METHODS: We developed a decision tree plus 10-state Markov model evaluating the 
identification of patients with an FH variant, statin treatment status, LDL-C 
levels, MI, and stroke to compare the costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness of population-wide FH genomic 
screening. FH variant prevalence (0.4%) was estimated from the Geisinger MyCode 
Community Health Initiative (MyCode). Genomic test costs were assumed to be 
$200. Age and sex-based estimates of MI, recurrent MI, stroke, and recurrent 
stroke were obtained from Framingham risk equations. Additional outcomes 
independently associated with FH variants were derived from a retrospective 
analysis of 26,025 participants screened for FH. Sensitivity and threshold 
analyses were conducted to evaluate model assumptions and uncertainty.
RESULTS: FH screening was most effective at younger ages; screening unselected 
20-year-olds lead to 111 QALYs gained per 100,000 individuals screened at an 
incremental cost of $20 M. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
20-year-olds was $181,000 per QALY, and there was a 38% probability of 
cost-effectiveness at a $100,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. If 
genomic testing cost falls to $100, the ICER would be $91,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Population FH screening is not cost-effective at current willingness 
to pay thresholds. However, reducing test costs, testing at younger ages, or 
including FH within broader multiplex screening panels may improve clinical and 
economic value.

Sarcopenia is an age-related muscle disorder typically associated with a poor 
quality of life. Its definition has evolved over time, and several underlying 
causes of sarcopenia in the elderly have been proposed. However, the exact 
mechanisms involved in sarcopenia, as well as effective treatments for this 
condition, are not fully understood. The purpose of this article was to conduct 
a comprehensive review of previous evidence regarding the definition, diagnosis, 
risk factors, and efficacy of plant-derived natural products for sarcopenia. The 
methodological approach for the current narrative review was performed using 
PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, as well as Google Scholar (up to 
March 2021) in order to satisfy our objectives. The substantial beneficial 
effects along with the safety of some plant-derived natural products including 
curcumin, resveratrol, catechin, soy protein, and ginseng on sarcopenia are 
reported in this review. Based on clinical studies, nutraceuticals and 
functional foods may have beneficial effects on physical performance, including 
handgrip and knee-extension strength, weight-lifting capacity, time or distance 
travelled before feeling fatigued, mitochondrial function, muscle fatigue, mean 
muscle fibre area, and total number of myonuclei. In preclinical studies, 
supplementation with herbs and natural bioactive compounds resulted in 
beneficial effects including increased plantaris mass, skeletal muscle mass and 
strength production, increased expression of anabolic factors myogenin, Myf5 and 
MyoD, enhanced mitochondrial capacity, and inhibition of muscle atrophy and 
sarcopenia. We found that several risk factors such as nutritional status, 
physical inactivity, inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine system 
dysfunction, insulin resistance, history of chronic disease, mental health, and 
genetic factors are linked or associated with sarcopenia. The substantial 
beneficial effects of some nutraceuticals and functional foods on sarcopenia, 
including curcumin, resveratrol, catechin, soy protein, and ginseng, without any 
significant side effects, are reported in this review. Plant-derived natural 
products might have a beneficial effect on various components of sarcopenia. 
Nevertheless, due to limited human trials, the clinical benefits of 
plant-derived natural products remain inconclusive. It is suggested that 
comprehensive longitudinal clinical studies to better understand risk factors 
over time, as well as identifying a treatment strategy for sarcopenia that is 
based on its pathophysiology, be undertaken in future investigations.

Efficient partitioning of above and below-ground biomass in response to nitrogen 
(N) is critical to the productivity of plants under sub-optimal conditions. It 
is particularly essential in vegetable crops like spinach with shallow root 
systems, a short growth cycle, and poor nitrogen use efficiency. In this study, 
we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore N-induced changes 
using spinach accessions with diverse genetic backgrounds. We evaluated 
phenotypic variations as percent changes in the shoot and root biomass in 
response to N using 201 spinach accessions grown in randomized complete blocks 
design in a soilless media under a controlled environment. A GWAS was performed 
for the percent changes in the shoot and root biomass in response to N in the 
201 spinach accessions using 60,940 whole-genome resequencing generated SNPs. 
Three SNP markers, chr4_28292655, chr6_1531056, and chr6_37966006 on chromosomes 
4 and 6, were significantly associated with %change in root weight, and two SNP 
markers, chr2_18480277 and chr4_47598760 on chromosomes 2 and 4, were 
significantly associated with % change shoot weight. The outcome of this study 
established a foundation for genetic studies needed to improve the partitioning 
of total biomass and provided a resource to identify molecular markers to 
enhance N uptake via marker-assisted selection or genomic selection in spinach 
breeding programs.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a highly complex and heterogeneous 
neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. Since life expectancy is 
relatively low, it is essential to promptly understand the course of the disease 
to better target the patient's treatment. Predictive models for disease 
progression are thus of great interest. One of the most extensive and 
well-studied open-access data resources for ALS is the Pooled Resource 
Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) repository. In 2015, the DREAM-Phil 
Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge was held on PRO-ACT data, where 
competitors were asked to develop machine learning algorithms to predict disease 
progression measured through the slope of the ALSFRS score between 3 and 
12 months. However, although it has already been successfully applied in several 
studies on ALS patients, to the best of our knowledge deep learning approaches 
still remain unexplored on the ALSFRS slope prediction in PRO-ACT cohort. Here, 
we investigate how deep learning models perform in predicting ALS progression 
using the PRO-ACT data. We developed three models based on different 
architectures that showed comparable or better performance with respect to the 
state-of-the-art models, thus representing a valid alternative to predict ALS 
disease progression.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, around 93,000 (0.8%) children and young people (CYP) are 
experiencing specific phobias that have a substantial impact on daily life. The 
current gold-standard treatment-multi-session cognitive behavioural therapy 
(CBT) - is effective at reducing specific phobia severity; however, CBT is time 
consuming, requires specialist CBT therapists, and is often at great cost and 
limited availability. A briefer variant of CBT called one session treatment 
(OST) has been found to offer similar clinical effectiveness for specific phobia 
as multi-session CBT. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of OST compared to multi-session CBT for CYP with specific phobias through the 
Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial (ASPECT), a two-arm, 
pragmatic, multi-centre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: CYP aged seven to 16 years with specific phobias were recruited 
nationally via Health and Social Care pathways, remotely randomised to the 
intervention group (OST) or the control group (CBT-based therapies) and analysed 
(n = 267). Resource use based on NHS and personal social services perspective 
and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) measured by EQ-5D-Y were collected at 
baseline and at six-month follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
was calculated, and non-parametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture the 
uncertainty around the ICER estimates. The results were presented on a 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). A set of sensitivity analyses 
(including taking a societal perspective) were conducted to assess the 
robustness of the primary findings.
RESULTS: After adjustment and bootstrapping, on average CYP in the OST group 
incurred less costs (incremental cost was -£302.96 (95% CI -£598.86 to -£28.61)) 
and maintained similar improvement in QALYs (QALYs gained 0.002 (95% CI - 0.004 
to 0.008)). The CEAC shows that the probability of OST being cost-effective was 
over 95% across all the WTP thresholds. Results of a set of sensitivity analyses 
were consistent with the primary outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Compared to CBT, OST produced a reduction in costs and maintained 
similar improvement in QALYs. Results from both primary and sensitivity analyses 
suggested that OST was highly likely to be cost saving.

Place is defined as a social or environmental area of residence with meaning to 
a patient. We hypothesize there is an association between place and the clinical 
outcomes of lung transplant recipients in the United States. In a retrospective 
cohort study of transplants between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019, in 
the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, multivariable Cox regression 
models were used to test the association between place (through social and 
environmental factors) with readmission, lung rejection, and survival. Among 
18,465 recipients, only 20% resided in the same county as the transplant center. 
Recipients from the most socially vulnerable counties when compared to the least 
vulnerable were more likely to have COPD as a native disease, Black or African 
American race, and travel long distances to reach a transplant center. Higher 
local life expectancy was associated with lower likelihood for readmission (odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84, 0.98, p = .01). Higher 
social vulnerability was associated with a higher likelihood of lung rejection 
(OR = 1.37, [CI]: 1.07, 1.76, p = .01). There was no association of residence 
with posttransplant survival. Recipient place-based factors were associated with 
complications and processes of care after transplant and warrant further 
investigation.

OBJECTIVES: We estimate patterns of covariation between COVID-19 and measles 
vaccination rates and a set of widely used indicators of human, social, and 
economic capital across 146 countries.
STUDY DESIGN: We conduct exploratory analyses of social patterns that uphold 
vaccination success for COVID-19 and measles.
METHODS: We use publicly available data on COVID vaccination rates and other 
country-level indicators from Our World in Data, Human Development Report, 
Corruption Perception Index, and the World Bank to devise bivariate correlations 
and multiple regression models.
RESULTS: About 70% of the variability in COVID-19 vaccination rates in February 
2022 can be explained by differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) and, 
specifically, in life expectancy at birth. Trust in doctors and nurses adds 
predictive value beyond HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between 
vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of HDI and vaccine 
availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general health 
system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of 
country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, 
predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. Measles vaccination in 2019 is 
similarly predicted by HDI and trust in doctors and nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: The remaining variability in COVID-19 vaccination success that 
cannot be pinned down through these sets of metrics points to a considerable 
scope for collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization 
and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical 
professionals, scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account 
for at least some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and 
inequity.

As hematophagous parasites, many tick species are important vectors of medical 
and veterinary disease agents. Proteins found in tick saliva and midgut have 
been used with some success in immunizations of animal hosts against feeding 
ticks, and whole saliva has been used effectively in this capacity against 
Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of tickborne pathogens in the United 
States. Tick saliva is a complex substance containing hundreds of proteins, and 
the identification of specific protective antigens is ongoing. We performed a 
series of experiments immunizing guinea pigs with extracts prepared from midgut 
or attachment cement collected from adult female I. scapularis followed by 
challenge with nymphs of the same species. Midgut extract did not induce 
protective immunity, while immunization with cement extract resulted in partial 
protection of hosts as evidenced by premature tick detachment and 34-41% 
reduction in tick engorgement weights. Proteomic characterization of I. 
scapularis cement was performed, demonstrating that the cement extract was 
compositionally different from tick saliva, and vitellogenin-like lipoproteins 
were the most abundant proteins in cement extract (>40%). Cement was also 
heavily enriched with lysozymes and defensins, including those originating from 
both the mammalian host as well as ticks. These results demonstrate that I. 
scapularis cement contains immunogenic components capable of stimulating host 
resistance against tick feeding. Because the cement is present at the tick-host 
interface for an extended period of time during the feeding process, these 
antigens present auspicious candidates for further evaluation and potential 
inclusion in an anti-tick vaccine.

L-Carnitine is widespread in nature, but little information is available on its 
metabolism and physiological functions in moderate halophiles. In this study, we 
found that Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM 3043 could utilize carnitine not only 
as a nutrient, but also as an osmolyte. When grown at 37 °C under salt-stress 
conditions, the strain utilized carnitine as an osmoprotectant by enzymatically 
converting it into GB. When grown at low and high temperature, both carnitine 
and its metabolic intermediate GB were simultaneously accumulated 
intracellularly, serving as cryoprotectants and thermoprotectants. The genes 
(csal_3172, csal_3173, and csal_3174) which were predicted to participate in 
L-carnitine degradation to GB were deleted to construct the corresponding 
mutants. The effects of salinity and temperature on the growth rates and 
cytoplasmic solute pools of the C. salexigens wild-type and mutant strains were 
investigated. 13C-NMR analysis revealed that GB was still detected in the 
Δcsal_3172Δcsal_3173Δcsal_3174 mutant grown in a defined medium with added 
DL-carnitine, but not with L-carnitine, indicating that an unidentified 
D-carnitine degradation pathway exists in C. salexigens. Taken together, the 
data presented in this study expand our knowledge on carnitine metabolism and 
its physiological functions in C. salexigens exposed to single or multiple 
environmental abiotic stress.

Comment in
    Lancet Infect Dis. 2022 Nov;22(11):1523-1525.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) and 
corresponding risk factors in children older than 5 years and adults has not 
been studied as comprehensively as it has been in children younger than 5 years. 
We assessed the burden and trends of LRIs and risk factors across all age groups 
by sex, for 204 countries and territories.
METHODS: In this analysis of data for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we used clinician-diagnosed pneumonia or 
bronchiolitis as our case definition for LRIs. We included International 
Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes 079.6, 466-469, 470.0, 480-482.8, 
483.0-483.9, 484.1-484.2, 484.6-484.7, and 487-489 and International 
Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes A48.1, A70, B97.4-B97.6, 
J09-J15.8, J16-J16.9, J20-J21.9, J91.0, P23.0-P23.4, and U04-U04.9. We used the 
Cause of Death Ensemble modelling strategy to analyse 23 109 site-years of vital 
registration data, 825 site-years of sample vital registration data, 1766 
site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 681 site-years of mortality surveillance 
data. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to analyse 
age-sex-specific incidence and prevalence data identified via systematic reviews 
of the literature, population-based survey data, and claims and inpatient data. 
Additionally, we estimated age-sex-specific LRI mortality that is attributable 
to the independent effects of 14 risk factors.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, we estimated that there were 257 million (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 240-275) LRI incident episodes in males and 232 
million (217-248) in females. In the same year, LRIs accounted for 1·30 million 
(95% UI 1·18-1·42) male deaths and 1·20 million (1·07-1·33) female deaths. 
Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were 1·17 times (95% UI 
1·16-1·18) and 1·31 times (95% UI 1·23-1·41) greater in males than in females in 
2019. Between 1990 and 2019, LRI incidence and mortality rates declined at 
different rates across age groups and an increase in LRI episodes and deaths was 
estimated among all adult age groups, with males aged 70 years and older having 
the highest increase in LRI episodes (126·0% [95% UI 121·4-131·1]) and deaths 
(100·0% [83·4-115·9]). During the same period, LRI episodes and deaths in 
children younger than 15 years were estimated to have decreased, and the 
greatest decline was observed for LRI deaths in males younger than 5 years 
(-70·7% [-77·2 to -61·8]). The leading risk factors for LRI mortality varied 
across age groups and sex. More than half of global LRI deaths in children 
younger than 5 years were attributable to child wasting (population attributable 
fraction [PAF] 53·0% [95% UI 37·7-61·8] in males and 56·4% [40·7-65·1] in 
females), and more than a quarter of LRI deaths among those aged 5-14 years were 
attributable to household air pollution (PAF 26·0% [95% UI 16·6-35·5] for males 
and PAF 25·8% [16·3-35·4] for females). PAFs of male LRI deaths attributed to 
smoking were 20·4% (95% UI 15·4-25·2) in those aged 15-49 years, 30·5% 
(24·1-36·9) in those aged 50-69 years, and 21·9% (16·8-27·3) in those aged 70 
years and older. PAFs of female LRI deaths attributed to household air pollution 
were 21·1% (95% UI 14·5-27·9) in those aged 15-49 years and 18·2% (12·5-24·5) in 
those aged 50-69 years. For females aged 70 years and older, the leading risk 
factor, ambient particulate matter, was responsible for 11·7% (95% UI 8·2-15·8) 
of LRI deaths.
INTERPRETATION: The patterns and progress in reducing the burden of LRIs and key 
risk factors for mortality varied across age groups and sexes. The progress seen 
in children younger than 5 years was clearly a result of targeted interventions, 
such as vaccination and reduction of exposure to risk factors. Similar 
interventions for other age groups could contribute to the achievement of 
multiple Sustainable Development Goals targets, including promoting wellbeing at 
all ages and reducing health inequalities. Interventions, including addressing 
risk factors such as child wasting, smoking, ambient particulate matter 
pollution, and household air pollution, would prevent deaths and reduce health 
disparities.

An increase in time spent walking is significantly associated with lower risks 
of mortality and disability. This study aimed to investigate the association 
between changes in time spent walking and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) 
in community-dwelling older people. Thirteen-year follow-up data from a cohort 
study of 7105 Japanese older adults (age ≥ 65 years) in 2006 were analyzed. 
Information on time spent walking was collected using questionnaires at two time 
points (1994 and 2006). Based on this information, the participants were 
categorized into four groups according to changes in time spent walking: 
remained inactive, became inactive, became active, and remained active. DFLE was 
defined as the average number of years a person could expect to live without 
disability. The multistate life table method using a Markov model was used to 
calculate DFLE. Of those who were inactive in 1994, DFLE of those who became 
active in 2006 (20.30 years in men; 24.06 years in women) was longer by about 
2 years than of those who remained inactive (17.96 years in men; 21.87 years in 
women), and it was as long as those who remained active (20.34 years in men; 
24.16 years in women). The 2-year difference in DFLE did not change after the 
participants were stratified by body mass index, motor function, cognitive 
function, and history of diseases. Increase in time spent walking is associated 
with longer DFLE in Japanese older people. Encouraging simple physical activity 
such as walking at the population level could increase life-years lived in good 
health.
