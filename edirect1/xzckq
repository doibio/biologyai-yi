OBJECTIVES: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive haematological cancer 
associated with significant humanistic impact. The current study assessed how 
the general public in the United Kingdom (UK) values AML health states.
METHODS: The composite time trade-off (cTTO) methodology was employed to elicit 
health state utilities in AML. Pertinent AML literature related to symptom and 
quality-of-life impact including physical, functional and emotional well-being, 
as well as the safety profile of AML treatments, were taken into consideration 
for drafting health state descriptions. Ten health states included in the study 
were newly diagnosed AML, induction, consolidation, maintenance, long-term 
follow-up, relapsed/refractory, stem-cell transplant (SCT) procedure, SCT 
recovery, SCT long-term follow-up with complications and SCT long-term follow-up 
without complications. The descriptions were validated by haematologists and 
nurse specialists for clinical accuracy and completeness. A total of 210 
individuals from the general UK population participated in the cTTO interviews. 
Descriptive statistics were computed for health state utility values.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 44.0 years (standard deviation 
[SD] 14.9, range 18-81) and comprised 129 (61.4%) female participants. The 
utility values ranged from 0.94 (SD 0.13) for SCT long-term follow-up without 
complications to - 0.21 (SD 0.62) for the SCT procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides health utilities for a range of AML health 
states, with the SCT procedure health state being valued worse than death. The 
utilities obtained in this study can be employed as inputs in cost-effectiveness 
analyses of AML therapies.

Longer duration of breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of type 2 
diabetes, breast and ovarian cancer, myocardial infarction, and hypertension 
diseases in women. Mexico has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates worldwide; 
therefore, estimating the disease and economic burden of such rates is needed to 
influence public policy. We considered suboptimal breastfeeding when fewer than 
95% of parous women breastfeed for less than 24 months per child, according to 
the World Health Organization recommendations. We quantified the lifetime excess 
cases of maternal health outcomes, premature death, disability-adjusted life 
years, direct costs, and indirect costs attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding 
practices from Mexico in 2012. We used a static microsimulation model for a 
hypothetical cohort of 100,000 Mexican women to estimate the lifetime economic 
cost and disease burden of type 2 diabetes, breast and ovarian cancer, 
myocardial infarction, and hypertension in mothers, due to suboptimal 
breastfeeding, compared with an optimal scenario of 95% of parous women 
breastfeeding for 24 months. We expressed cost in 2016 USD. We used a 3% 
discount rate and tested in sensitivity analysis 0% and 5% discount rates. We 
found that the 2012 suboptimal scenario was associated with 5,344 more cases of 
all analysed diseases, 1,681 additional premature deaths, 66,873 
disability-adjusted life years, and 561.94 million USD for direct and indirect 
costs over the lifetime of a cohort of 1,116 million Mexican women. Findings 
suggest that investments in strategies to enable more women to optimally 
breastfeed could result in important health and cost savings.

The aim of the current study was to examine the possible relationship between 
the mutual effects of smoking and low cholesterol on all-cause, 
non-cardiovascular, and cardiovascular mortalities in males. This is a 
prospective cohort study of 30,179 males sampled from the Risk Factors and Life 
Expectancy (RIFLE) studies in the Italian population. The RIFLE data are from 19 
different large-scale studies over a 9.5-year follow-up period. The Cox 
Proportional Hazard model was applied to analyze the data. The associations are 
presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Cholesterol 
data were reported in categories. There were significant mortality risk mutual 
associations for never-smokers and those in the low cholesterol category (<160 
mg/dl) for all-cause (HR = 3.13, 95% CI [1.69, 5.80]), and non-cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) (HR = 6.51, 95% CI [2.19, 19.33]) mortality in men with an 
insignificant risk for CVD mortality (HR = 1.90, 95% CI [0.85, 4.22]). There 
were significant mortality risk associations of the mutual effects of ex-smokers 
and low cholesterol for non-CVD in the first to third cholesterol categories (HR 
= 2.50, 95% CI [1.40, 4.46]; HR = 2.65, 95% CI [1.50, 4.71]; HR = 2.12, 95% CI 
[1.17, 3.82], respectively), but no significant findings for all-cause and CVD 
deaths. Furthermore, there were significant mortality risk association of mutual 
effects of current-smokers and low cholesterol for non-CVD (HR = 1.56, 95% CI 
[1.11, 2.28]) in the first category of cholesterol level, but insignificant risk 
associations for all-cause deaths (HR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.89, 1.66]). 
Interestingly, findings indicate a mutual protective association for 
current-smokers and low cholesterol (<160 mg/dl) for CVD risk in males (HR = 
0.42, 95% CI [0.19, 0.91]). Findings of this study identified significant 
mortality risk association for mutual effects of never-smokers, ex-smokers, and 
low cholesterol for non-CVD. However, there is significant protective 
association for current-smokers and low cholesterol for CVD.

The olfactory receptor neurons lining the nasal cavity have a remarkable 
capacity to regenerate throughout life. They are replenished continuously and 
their axons make new connections within the olfactory bulb. However, some 
factors such as head trauma and skull base surgery damage the olfactory nerve 
which lead to olfactory dysfunction. Losing the sense of smell has considerable 
effects on quality of life and life-expectancy. Therefore, there is a clear need 
to find a treatment for olfactory dysfunction. One such potential treatment is 
growth factor therapy which showed promising results in the spinal cord and 
brain injuries. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether combined 
delivery of two growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor and 
platelet-derived growth factor treatment can improve the olfactory neurons 
regeneration in mice. The degeneration of the olfactory neurons was induced by 
unilateral bulbectomy. The treatment group received 1.5 µg of the combined 
growth factors intranasally, while the control injured group received saline. 
Growth factor treatment significantly increased the number of immature neurons 
at 5 and 7 days post injury and also the number of mature olfactory neurons at 
10 and 14 days post bulbectomy. Regenerating axons extended over a larger volume 
in the operated cavity in the treatment group compared to control group at 14 
days post bulbectomy. The growth factor treatment also significantly reduced 
astrocytic glia scar in the operated cavity. The results indicate that the 
combined delivery of the growth factors has the potential to improve olfactory 
dysfunction.

Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) comprises a group of 
congenital cardiovascular anomalies associated with pulmonary venous flow 
directly or indirectly into the right atrium. Scimitar syndrome is a variant of 
PAPVR in which the right lung is drained by right pulmonary veins connected 
anomalously to the inferior vena cava. Surgery is the definitive treatment for 
scimitar syndrome. However, it is not always necessary as many patients are 
asymptomatic, have small left-to-right shunts, and enjoy a normal life 
expectancy without surgery. We report multimodality imaging in four adults with 
scimitar syndrome and the implications for management of this rare syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the efficiency of 190 countries in producing health 
results and the factors that determine such efficiency.
METHODOLOGY: A data envelopment analysis was conducted on worldwide data from 
the year 2009 in order to estimate the efficient frontier, based on total health 
expenditure per capita, as well on infant mortality rate and life expectancy at 
birth. At the same time, an analysis of the determinants of expenditure 
efficiency was performed through Tobit models.
RESULTS: African nations have lower technical and allocative efficiency, but 
higher scale efficiency. The quality of institutions has a statistically 
significant impact on the levels of technical and allocative efficiency and on 
the levels of scale efficiency. The percentage of health expenditure financed by 
private insurers has an impact on technical and allocative efficiency, while 
urbanization rates affect the scale efficiency.
DISCUSSION: the fact that more than 70 % of countries show decreasing returns 
suggest that, once certain minimal standards of life quality are achieved, the 
marginal effect of each additional dollar assigned to health is not substantial. 
Conversely, in poor countries, where the expenditure in health presents 
increasing returns, the health performance could be substantially better by 
marginally raising the expenditure. On the other hand, financing structures of 
health expenditures may influence technical-allocative efficiency, while 
urbanization levels may impact scale efficiency (source: MeSH, NLM).

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Mostrar la utilidad de una herramienta estadística no 
paramétrica para medir la eficiencia de 190 países en la producción de status de 
salud, así como conocer los determinantes de dicha eficiencia.
MÉTODOS: Con datos de 2009, y utilizando la técnica de Envolvente de Datos, se 
estima la frontera de eficiencia, utilizando como insumo al gasto total en salud 
per cápita y como productos la tasa de mortalidad infantil y la esperanza de 
vida al nacer. Se realiza un análisis de los determinantes de la eficiencia del 
gasto mediante el uso de modelos Tobit.
RESULTADOS: Las naciones del continente africano presentan menor eficiencia 
técnico-asignativa, aunque mayor eficiencia de escala. La calidad de las 
instituciones muestra un impacto estadísticamente significativo sobre los 
niveles de eficiencia técnico-asignativa y de escala. El porcentaje de 
financiamiento del gasto por parte de aseguradoras privadas incide sobre la 
eficiencia técnico-asignativa mientras que el porcentaje de urbanización lo hace 
sobre la eficiencia de escala.
DISCUSIÓN: El hecho de que más del 70 % de los países presente rendimientos 
decrecientes del gasto en salud sugeriría que, una vez alcanzados ciertos 
estándares mínimos de calidad de vida, el efecto marginal de cada dólar 
adicional destinado a salud no es sustancial. En países pobres donde el gasto en 
salud presenta rendimientos crecientes, el desempeño sanitario podría mejorar 
significativamente con incrementos marginales del gasto. Las estructuras de 
financiamiento del gasto en salud podrían estar influyendo sobre la eficiencia 
técnico-asignativa y el grado de urbanización podría hacerlo sobre la eficiencia 
de escala.

Bactrocera flies are economic pests of agricultural crops all over the world. 
Among Bactrocera flies, oriental fruit fly is an economically important pest of 
fruit crops in the world. Basic studies of Bactrocera flies are very important 
and helpful to the development of integrated management strategies. However, 
basic studies regarding behavior and age-stage, two-sex life table traits for 
this pest, which are vital for designing effective control methods, are 
currently lacking. Considering the importance of B. dorsalis, this study aimed 
to evaluate the fruit preference and age-stage, two-sex life table traits of B. 
dorsalis on guava (Psidium guajava), papaya (Carica papaya), and banana (Musa 
acuminata) fruits in the laboratory. In choice and no-choice tests, the number 
of visits and oviposition punctures made by female B. dorsalis flies were 
significantly higher on guava than those on papaya and banana. The life cycle 
from eggs to male (146.95 ± 3.43 d) and female (164.94 ± 3.85 d) adults was 
significantly longer on papaya than those on banana and guava. Bactrocera 
dorsalis females produced significantly more eggs when fed on guava (623.30 eggs 
female-1) than on papaya (527.80 eggs female-1) or banana (399.60 eggs 
female-1). Guava was the more suitable fruit for B. dorsalis, and could be used 
as a bait fruit to manage the B. dorsalis during the fruiting season of papaya 
and banana.

BACKGROUND: Issues surrounding gender and men's health have become an increasing 
focus of public health globally. Unhealthy lifestyles and lower engagement in 
health promotion initiatives contributed to lower life expectancy and higher 
mortality rates among men. This study presents the pre-adoption characteristics 
of men who registered for 'Men on the Move'-a community-based physical activity 
(CBPA) programme, to ascertain whether the programme reached its intended target 
group, i.e. 'at-risk' adult men who did not meet physical activity (PA) 
guidelines and were likely to have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD).
METHODS: Multiple recruitment strategies were adopted to engage the target group 
and baseline data collection included a range of demographic, self-report and 
outcome measures.
RESULTS: The recruitment strategy succeeded in reaching the target group, with 
the majority (n = 927) presenting being previously inactive (89.0%), 
overweight/obese (89.7%) and having multiple CVD risk factors (53.1% ≥ 2 risk 
factors). However, the strategy was less successful in engaging 'hard-to-reach' 
groups, with the majority being middle-aged, white, married/cohabiting, educated 
and employed.
CONCLUSIONS: A gender-sensitized, partnership and community outreach recruitment 
strategy can maximize the reach and recruitment of an 'at-risk' cohort for CBPA 
initiatives, but more targeted approaches are needed to recruit marginalized 
groups of men.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate health outcomes of policies to mitigate the opioid 
epidemic.
METHODS: We used dynamic compartmental modeling of US adults, in various pain, 
opioid use, and opioid addiction health states, to project addiction-related 
deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years from 2016 to 2025 for 11 
policy responses to the opioid epidemic.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, increasing naloxone availability, promoting needle 
exchange, expanding medication-assisted addiction treatment, and increasing 
psychosocial treatment increased life years and quality-adjusted life years and 
reduced deaths. Other policies reduced opioid prescription supply and related 
deaths but led some addicted prescription users to switch to heroin use, which 
increased heroin-related deaths. Over a longer horizon, some such policies may 
avert enough new addiction to outweigh the harms. No single policy is likely to 
substantially reduce deaths over 5 to 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies focused on services for addicted people improve population 
health without harming any groups. Policies that reduce the prescription opioid 
supply may increase heroin use and reduce quality of life in the short term, but 
in the long term could generate positive health benefits. A portfolio of 
interventions will be needed for eventual mitigation.

The distribution of age at diagnosis in ocular sarcoidosis has shifted towards 
the older age groups in developed countries. In systemic sarcoidosis, 
age-related differences in the clinical presentation, which reflect the 
therapeutic strategies, was reported. We retrospectively compared 100 
consecutive patients from April 2010 to March 2016 who were initially diagnosed 
with ocular sarcoidosis by International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis 
criteria. They were classified into elder (>65 years: 50 patients) and younger 
(≤65 years: 50 patients) groups by the age at diagnosis of uveitis associated 
with sarcoidosis. All patients received ophthalmic examination to assess the 
presence of seven intraocular signs and 4 laboratory parameters. Significantly 
fewer ocular signs (2.8 ± 1.5 and 3.6 ± 1.5; P = 0.0034) and abnormal laboratory 
results (1.5 ± 1.2 and 2.0 ± 1.2; P = 0.023) were detected in the elder group 
than in the younger group; statistical differences were found between the groups 
regarding the frequencies of mutton-fat keratic precipitates (40% and 64%; P = 
0.012), vitreous opacities (60% and 78%; P = 0.0059), bilateral inflammation 
(64% and 80%; P = 0.012), and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy between the groups 
(52% and 78%; P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed negative 
correlations between age and number of detected ocular signs (r = -0.36, P < 
0.001) and laboratory results (r = -0.20, P = 0.023). The characteristic ocular 
signs and abnormal laboratory results had a lower frequency in the elder 
patients compared with the younger patients. Probable or possible ocular 
sarcoidosis by the international criteria should increase with increased life 
expectancy in developed countries.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess population-level cost-effectiveness of the 
Weight Watchers (WW) program with doctor referral compared with standard care 
(SC) for Australian adults with overweight and obesity.
METHODS: The target population was Australian adults ≥ 20 years old with 
BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 , whose obesity status was subsequently modeled for 2015 to 2025. 
A microsimulation model (noncommunicable disease model [NCDMod]) was used to 
assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of WW compared with SC. A health 
system perspective was taken, and outcomes were measured by obesity cases 
averted in 2025, BMI units averted for 2015 to 2025, and quality-adjusted life 
years for 2015 to 2025. Univariate sensitivity testing was used to measure 
variations in the model parameters.
RESULTS: The WW intervention resulted in 60,445 averted cases of obesity in 2025 
(2,311 more cases than for SC), extra intervention costs of A$219 million, and 
cost savings within the health system of A$17,248 million (A$82 million more 
than for SC) for 2015 to 2025 compared with doing nothing. The modeled WW had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$35,195 in savings per case of obesity 
averted in 2025. WW remained dominant over SC for the different scenarios in the 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The WW intervention represents good value for money. The WW 
intervention needs serious consideration in a national package of obesity health 
services.

BACKGROUND: A high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) level is recommended to 
promote healthy aging. However, the association between CRF and very-long-term 
prognosis is unclear, and reverse causation may bias results in studies with 
shorter follow-up.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the association between CRF and mortality in 
middle-aged, employed men free of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: Participants from the Copenhagen Male Study, established in 1970 to 
1971, were included and stratified into 4 age-adjusted maximal oxygen 
consumption (Vo2max) categories: below the lower limit of normal (lowest 5%); 
low normal (45%); high normal (45%); and above the upper limit of normal (top 
5%). Vo2max was estimated by using a bicycle ergometer. Multivariable restricted 
mean survival time models were performed for all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality using Danish national registers.
RESULTS: A total of 5,107 men with a mean age of 48.8 ± 5.4 years were included 
in the study. During the 46 years of follow-up, 4,700 (92%) men died; 2,149 
(42.1%) of the men died of CVD. Compared with below the lower limit of normal 
CRF, low normal CRF was associated with 2.1 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.7 to 3.4; p = 0.002), high normal with 2.9 years (95% CI: 1.5 to 4.2; p < 
0.001), and above upper limit of normal with 4.9 years (95% CI: 3.1 to 6.7; 
p < 0.001) longer mean life expectancy. Each unit increase in Vo2max was 
associated with a 45-day (95% CI: 30 to 61; p < 0.001) increase in longevity. 
Estimates for cardiovascular mortality were similar to all-cause mortality. 
Results were essentially unchanged when excluding individuals who died within 
the first 10 years of follow-up, suggesting a minimal role of reverse causation.
CONCLUSIONS: CRF was significantly related to longevity over the course of 4 
decades in middle-aged, employed men free of CVD. The benefits of higher midlife 
CRF extend well into the later part of life.

Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (CTCL) with a median life expectancy of less than 4 years. Although 
initial treatment responses are often good, the vast majority of patients with 
SS fail to respond to ongoing therapy. We hypothesize that malignant T cells are 
highly heterogeneous and harbor subpopulations of SS cells that are both 
sensitive and resistant to treatment. Here, we investigate the presence of 
single-cell heterogeneity and resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors 
(HDACi) within primary malignant T cells from patients with SS. Using 
single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we find that malignant T cells 
from all investigated patients with SS display a high degree of single-cell 
heterogeneity at both the mRNA and protein levels. We show that this 
heterogeneity divides the malignant cells into distinct subpopulations that can 
be isolated by their expression of different surface antigens. Finally, we show 
that treatment with HDACi (suberanilohydroxamic acid and romidepsin) selectively 
eliminates some subpopulations while leaving other subpopulations largely 
unaffected. In conclusion, we show that patients with SS display a high degree 
of single-cell heterogeneity within the malignant T-cell population, and that 
distinct subpopulations of malignant T cells carry HDACi resistance. Our data 
point to the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of malignant 
SS cells in each individual patient to design combinational and new therapies to 
counter drug resistance and treatment failure.

Background: We investigated whether low socioeconomic status (SES), which is 
associated with reduced health and life expectancy, might play a role in 
increased risk for infectious diseases. Therefore, we explored the association 
between SES and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels against various pathogens. 
Methods: We analyzed the association between SES [educational level and net 
household income (NHI)] and serum IgG concentration against measles, mumps, 
rubella, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), pneumococcus, 
meningococcus serogroup C (MenC), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) collected within a 
national cross-sectional serosurvey (2006/2007) using linear regression analyses 
among non-vaccinated individuals. Results: Higher educational level was 
associated with higher IgG concentrations against measles (GMC ratio 1.34, 95% 
CI 1.18-1.53) and rubella (1.13, 1.02-1.25) compared to low education level. In 
contrast, higher education level was associated with lower IgG concentrations 
against pneumococcus (0.78, 0.70-0.88), MenC (0.54, 0.44-0.68), and CMV (0.23, 
0.18-0.31) compared to low education level. This pattern was also evident when 
NHI was used as SES indicator. Conclusion: Our study suggests that socioeconomic 
status is associated with antibody levels in a pathogen-dependent manner. The 
results suggest that differences in serological response upon infection or 
differences in exposure might be involved in the variation in IgG levels between 
SES groups.

Cystic pancreatic lesions are common findings in an aging society due to an 
increasing availability of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. Although the 
overall prevalence of malignancy and the rate of malignant conversion are low, 
especially mucinous pancreatic cystic lesions such as intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystic neoplasm harbor significant malignant 
potential depending on their morphology and size. Recently updated guidelines 
recommend sophisticated algorithms for initial workup and surveillance based on 
individual characteristics of the cystic lesion and the patient, thus weighing 
the lifetime risk for malignancy against the adverse event rate of potentially 
curative surgery in the light of number and location of cystic lesions, age of 
the patient, comorbidities, and the resulting life expectancy as well as the 
effect of repeated follow-up examinations on the patient's quality of life. This 
article summarizes recommendations from available guidelines and proposes a 
pragmatic approach to the clinical management of pancreatic cystic lesions.

IMPORTANCE: Evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary high-risk 
human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is needed to inform guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To inform the US Preventive Services Task Force by modeling the 
benefits and harms of various cervical cancer screening strategies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation model of a hypothetical 
cohort of women initiating screening at age 21 years.
EXPOSURES: Screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, and cytology and hrHPV 
cotesting, varying age to switch from cytology to hrHPV testing or cotesting 
(25, 27, 30 years), rescreening interval (3, 5 years), and triage options for 
hrHPV-positive results (16/18 genotype, cytology testing). Current 
guidelines-based screening strategies comprised cytology alone every 3 years 
starting at age 21 years, with or without a switch to cytology and hrHPV 
cotesting every 5 years from ages 30 to 65 years. Complete adherence for all 19 
strategies was assumed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime number of tests, colposcopies, disease 
detection, false-positive results, cancer cases and deaths, life-years, and 
efficiency ratios expressing the trade-off of harms (ie, colposcopies, tests) vs 
benefits (life-years gained, cancer cases averted). Efficient strategies were 
those that yielded more benefit and less harm than another strategy or a lower 
harm to benefit ratio than a strategy with less harms.
RESULTS: Compared with no screening, all modeled cervical cancer screening 
strategies were estimated to result in substantial reductions in cancer cases 
and deaths and gains in life-years. The effectiveness of screening across the 
different strategies was estimated to be similar, with primary hrHPV-based and 
alternative cotesting strategies having slightly higher effectiveness and 
greater harms than current guidelines-based cytology testing. For example, 
cervical cancer deaths associated with the guidelines-based strategies ranged 
from 0.30 to 0.76 deaths per 1000 women, whereas new strategies involving 
primary hrHPV testing or cotesting were associated with fewer cervical cancer 
deaths, ranging from 0.23 to 0.29 deaths per 1000 women. In all analyses, 
primary hrHPV testing strategies occurring at 5-year intervals were efficient. 
For example, 5-year primary hrHPV testing (cytology triage) based on switching 
from cytology to hrHPV screening at ages 30 years, 27 years, and 25 years had 
ratios per life-year gained of 73, 143, and 195 colposcopies, respectively. In 
contrast, strategies involving 3-year hrHPV testing had much higher ratios, 
ranging from 2188 to 3822 colposcopies per life-year gained. In most analyses, 
strategies involving cotesting were not efficient.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation modeling study, it was 
estimated that primary hrHPV screening may represent a reasonable balance of 
harms and benefits when performed every 5 years. Switching from cytology to 
hrHPV testing at age 30 years yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio 
when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.

Brown adipose tissue aging and the concomitant loss of thermogenic capacity have 
been linked to an inability to maintain normal energy homeostasis in late life. 
Similarly, the ability of white fat to convert into brite/beige adipose tissue 
declines. This may ultimately exacerbate the progression of age-related 
metabolic pathologies, such as insulin resistance and obesity. The depletion of 
all types of brown adipocytes during aging is well-established and has been 
described in rodent models as well as humans. We here review the available 
literature on the potential mechanisms leading to cell-autonomous and 
microenvironment-related aspects of brown adipocyte dysfunction. Among these, 
cellular senescence, mitochondrial impairment, and deteriorating changes to the 
local and endocrine microenvironments have been proposed. An important goal of 
aging research is to develop approaches that may not only extend life expectancy 
but also prolong health-span. These efforts may also be aimed at maintaining 
metabolic health throughout life by targeting brown adipocyte function.

BACKGROUND: Many risk factors, which contribute to the development of overweight 
and/or obesity have been investigated and identified. However, one of the 
largest independent contributors to the obesity epidemic, which is often 
overlooked, is the increased consumption of sweetened beverages, particularly 
among the adolescents and young adults.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between 
sweetened beverage consumption and the development of overweight and obesity 
among the students of The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus in 
the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used, with a 
non-probability sampling method. The target population were the students of the 
University of the West Indies, St Augustine aged ≥18 years of age. The research 
data were collected through the distribution of a self-administered 
questionnaire, which was completed by each participant while anthropometric and 
clinical measurements were completed by the researchers. A total of 161 
questionnaires were distributed to the students of participants. Out of 161 
questionnaires distributed, 137 were collected, but only 133 were fully 
completed, which gave a response rate of 83%. Statistical analyses were 
conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS: 97.1% of the participants stated that they consumed sweetened beverages 
while only 2.9% said that they did not. Based on the results generated from 
chi-squared statistic test, there was no association between BMI and gender, age 
group, ethnicity, and the frequency of the consumption of sweetened beverages 
and their quantities.
CONCLUSION: No association between the intakes of sweetened beverages and 
overweight and/or obesity was found among the participants, but a very high 
prevalence of the consumption of these beverages was observed in the subjects.

The Dialysis Less Traveled By.

Huff C.

Many diabetes patients can use peritoneal dialysis, which allows them to 
self-administer dialysis at home. But researchers and kidney specialists say 
there are many obstacles in the way: a lack of doctors and nurses with training 
in how to instruct patients, the sunk costs of existing dialysis clinics, and 
the reluctance of patients and their families.

Epigenetic clocks for mice were generated based on deep-sequencing analysis of 
the methylome. Here, we demonstrate that site-specific analysis of DNA 
methylation levels by pyrosequencing at only three CG dinucleotides (CpGs) in 
the genes Prima1, Hsf4, and Kcns1 facilitates precise estimation of 
chronological age in murine blood samples, too. DBA/2 mice revealed accelerated 
epigenetic aging as compared to C57BL6 mice, which is in line with their shorter 
life-expectancy. The three-CpG-predictor provides a simple and cost-effective 
biomarker to determine biological age in large intervention studies with mice.

BACKGROUND: Photochemical modeling can predict the level and distribution of 
pollutant concentrations over time, but is resource-intensive. Partly for this 
reason, there are few studies exploring the multi-year trajectory of the 
historical change in fine particle (PM2.5) levels and associated health impacts 
in the U.S.
OBJECTIVES: We used a unique dataset of Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) 
model simulations performed for a subset of years over a decade-long period 
fused with observations to estimate the change in ambient levels of PM2.5 across 
the contiguous U.S. We also quantified the change in PM2.5-attributable health 
risks and characterized the level of risk inequality over this period.
METHODS: We estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in 2005, 2011 and 2014. 
Using log-linear and logistic concentration-response coefficients we estimated 
changes in the numbers of deaths, hospital admissions and other morbidity 
outcomes. Calculating the Gini coefficient and Atkinson Index, we characterized 
the extent to which PM2.5 attributable risks were shared equally across the 
population or instead concentrated among certain subgroups.
RESULTS: In 2005 the estimated fraction of deaths due to PM2.5 was 6.1%. This 
estimated value falls to 4.6% by 2014. Every portion of the contiguous U.S. 
experiences a decline in the risk of PM-related premature death over the 10-year 
period. As measured by the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index, the level of PM 
mortality risk is shared more equally in 2014 than in 2005 among all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2005 and 2014, the level of PM2.5 concentrations fall, and 
the risk of premature death, declined and became more equitably distributed 
across the U.S.
