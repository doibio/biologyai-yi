University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.

AIM: To explore framing or editing effects and a method to debias framing in a 
clinical context.
METHOD: Clinical scenarios using multioutcome life-expectancy lotteries of equal 
value required choices between two supplementary drugs that either prolonged or 
shortened life from the 20-year beneficial effect of a baseline drug. The 
effects of these supplementary drugs were presented in two conditions, using a 
between-subjects design. In segregated editing (n = 116) the effects were 
presented separately from the effects of the baseline drug. In integrated 
editing (n = 100), effects of supplementary and baseline drugs were combined in 
the lottery presentation. Each subject responded to 30 problems. To explore one 
method of debiasing, another 100 subjects made choices after viewing both 
segregated and integrated editings of 20 problems (dual framing).
RESULTS: Statistically significant preference reversals between segregated and 
integrated editing of pure lotteries occurred only when one framing placed 
outcomes in the gain domain, and the other framing placed them in the loss 
domain. When both editings resulted in gain-domain outcomes only, there was no 
framing effect. There was a related relationship of framing-effect shifts from 
losses to gains in mixed-lottery-choice problems. Responses to the dual framing 
condition did not consistently coincide with responses to either single framing. 
In some situations, dual framing eliminated or lessened framing effects.
CONCLUSION: The results support two components of prospect theory, coding 
outcomes as gains or losses from a reference point, and an s-shaped utility 
function (concave in gain, convex in loss domains). Presenting both alternative 
editings of a complex situation prior to choice more fully informs the decision 
maker and may help to reduce framing effects. Given the extent to which 
preferences shift in response to alternative presentations, it is unclear which 
choice represents the subject's "true preferences."

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Dental implants are expanding their use among partially 
edentulous patients. However, whether implants can promote the quality of life 
(QOL) of these patients has not been sufficiently examined.
PURPOSE: This study compared the QOL level among implant denture, removable 
partial denture, and no restoration patients with distal extension type 
unilateral mandibular edentulism.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three groups (n = 12 each) of subjects with unilateral 
mandibular distal-extension edentulism who were matched for age, sex, and 
missing teeth were studied. The groups were (1) implant denture, (2) removable 
partial denture, and (3) no restoration. QOL levels of these 3 groups were 
compared using a self-administered questionnaire with 3 major subscales: oral 
condition, general condition, and dental treatment.
RESULTS: The implant denture group showed higher oral condition related QOL 
score than the other groups. There was no significant difference in oral 
condition-related QOL scores between the removable partial denture and no 
restoration groups. There was no significant difference in the general condition 
related QOL score and dental treatment-related score among the 3 groups.
CONCLUSION: In unilateral mandibular distal extension edentulous patients, 
oral-condition-related QOL levels for dental implant patients were higher than 
those of removable partial denture or no restoration patients. The QOL levels of 
the removable partial denture patients were almost identical to those of no 
restoration patients.

A new method for expressing survival and life expectancy in lifetime 
cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate cancer patients (review).

The methodology of cost-effectiveness studies that use a lifetime perspective is 
based on the extrapolation to infinity of the survival curves. However, the 
research in this methodological area is at an initial phase. Hence, adequate 
techniques for survival curve extrapolation still need to be devised for 
handling the different clinical settings that can be analysed by 
cost-effectiveness survival studies. After a brief overview of the two most 
commonly used extrapolation methods (Markov decision-tree model and Gompertz 
technique), we describe a new method for expressing lifetime survival in 
cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate cancer patients. Our method 
extrapolates to infinity a traditional survival curve by assigning a normal life 
expectancy to patients (or long-term survivors). In this way, the value of mean 
lifetime survival (MLS) for the patient cohort under study can be determined 
using a lifetime perspective. This value can be employed in lifetime 
cost-effectiveness analyses that compare different forms of intervention for 
that disease condition. A separate section of our method compares the overall 
survival pattern of cured and not cured patients with that of a reference 
healthy population to assess the impact of the disease on life expectancy. As an 
example of the application of our method, we reanalysed a survival data set 
reported by Spinolo et al in 1992, that refers to patients with acute leukaemia 
who relapsed after their first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and who 
received a second transplant (n=17, mean age at relapse = 26 years). The use of 
our extrapolation method provided the following results: MLS for leukaemia 
patients = 105.9 months per patient or 8.8 years per patient; MLS for the 
reference cohort of healthy subjects = 583.8 months per patient or 48.6 years 
per patient. We conclude that the extrapolation technique described herein can 
be useful to handle lifetime survival data in cost-effectiveness analysis.

in chorioamnionitis before 32 weeks of gestation: histological associations and 
neonatal outcome.

Hospital, Assistance Publique/Hôpitaux de Paris, Clamart, France.

OBJECTIVES: To test the association between cytokine levels in the amniotic 
fluid and (i) the vascular invasion phase of intrauterine infection, (ii) the 
occurrence of periventricular leukomalacia; to assess the correlation between 
C-reactive protein levels, a recognised biological marker of inflammation in 
maternal serum and cytokine levels in the amniotic fluid.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
SETTING: Fetal medicine unit and neonatal intensive care unit, Antoine Beclere 
Hospital, Clamart, France.
SAMPLE: Thirty-one pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis leading to birth 
before 32 weeks of gestation.
METHODS: Interleukin 1-beta, Interleukin 6 and TNF-alpha prospectively measured 
in the amniotic fluid. Histological examination of the placenta. Ultrasound 
examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the brains of the newborn infants 
performed within the first week of life.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence of periventricular leukomalacia was 
assessed by transfontanellar ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between the occurrence of 
histological chorioamnionitis, vascular extension of infection of the membranes, 
maternal inflammatory syndrome and neonatal sepsis. A strong association was 
found between maternal serum C-reactive protein concentrations and cytokine 
levels in the amniotic fluid. Interleukin-1beta was the best predictor of 
vascular extension of chorioamnionitis, and TNF-alpha was the best predictor of 
the development of severe early neonatal infection. There was no association 
between the amniotic fluid levels of cytokines and the development of 
periventricular leukomalacia.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced 
in relation to intrauterine inflammation and infection, but cannot be directly 
implicated in the development of fetal cerebral white matter lesions.

The economic impact of geriatric hip fractures.

Youm T(1), Koval KJ, Zuckerman JD.

Author information:
(1)New York University, NY, USA.

Hip fractures, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, 
are expected to exponentially increase in frequency over the next 50 years as a 
result of increased life expectancy and population growth. The economic impact 
of the cost of hip fractures may be enormous. The overall cost of hip fractures 
includes not only death and illness, but also the costs of medical and custodial 
care, functional limitations, reduced quality of life, loss of independence, and 
inability to work, as well as other factors that are difficult to assess--most 
notably, the indirect effect of the hip fracture on the spouse or family members 
responsible for care. This review will evaluate the cost of geriatric hip 
fractures in the hopes of defining the enormous socioeconomic burden of such 
fractures.

PALA versus streptozotocin, doxorubicin, and MeCCNU in the treatment of patients 
with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Witte RS(1), Ryan LM, Schutt AJ, Carbone PP, Engstrom PF.

Author information:
(1)Gundersen Lutheran, LaCrosse, WI, USA.

Seventy-three eligible, chemotherapy-naive, ambulatory patients with advanced 
pancreatic carcinoma were allocated to one of two treatment regimens: 35 
received PALA (1250 mg/m2 daily x 5 every 4 weeks) and 38 were given SAM 
(streptozotocin 400 mg/m2 i.v. daily x 5, doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 
22, and methyl CCNU 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 and 22 every 6 weeks). Doses were 
modified for myelo-, gi-, or cardiotoxicity. Adequate organ, bone marrow and 
cardiac function; a measurable lesion; adequate caloric intake; and a life 
expectancy of 2 months were required for treatment on this trial. One patient on 
each regimen had a partial response for response rates of 3% (95% confidence 
intervals, 0.08 to 17%). Median survival on the PALA arm was 5 months and median 
time to treatment failure was 2.6 months. SAM patients experienced median 
overall and progression free survivals of 3.4 and 1.9 months, respectively. The 
severe toxicity observed was almost exclusively myelosuppression on both 
regimens. One patient receiving SAM had lethal leukopenic sepsis during the 
first cycle as the only treatment-related death. Neither PALA nor SAM offer any 
therapeutic utility to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

(1)Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New 
York, NY 10021, USA.

The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of 
pyrazoloacridine in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Eligible patients had 
advanced renal cell carcinoma with bidimensionally measurable disease, a 
Karnofsky performance status of at least 70, life expectancy of greater than 
three months, no prior treatment with chemotherapy, and no evidence of brain 
metastases. Patients were treated intravenously with 750 mg/m2 every three 
weeks. Twelve patients were enrolled in this study and all were evaluable for 
response and toxicity. Of the twelve patients, no major responses were achieved. 
Toxicity was mild, with three patients requiring a 20% dose reduction. At the 
dose and schedule used in this trial, pyrazoloacridine is inactive in renal cell 
carcinoma.

Cumulative probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth after a multiple 
cycle IVF package: a more realistic assessment of overall and age-specific 
success rates?

OBJECTIVE: To provide an assessment of pregnancy and live birth probabilities 
for women presenting for in vitro fertilisation treatment for the first time, 
when committed in advance to have up to three cycles of treatment in one year.
DESIGN: Up to three cycles of in vitro fertilisation within one year, committed 
in advance.
SETTING: A tertiary referral centre for assisted reproduction.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and thirty-two women, undergoing a total of 536 cycles 
of in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection between August 
1993 and December 1995.
METHODS: Analysis of cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates for 
women having IVF treatment for the first time and undertaking a three-cycle 
package, using the life-table approach.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.
RESULTS: The cumulative probabilities of clinical pregnancy and live birth after 
two cycles of treatment were 38.2% and 33.2%, respectively, compared with 54.2% 
and 48.2%, respectively, after three cycles of treatment. Cumulative clinical 
pregnancy and live birth rates after three cycles of treatment for women up to 
the age of 40 years were 57.8% and 51.3%, respectively. Cumulative clinical 
pregnancy and live birth rates declined with increasing age (P = 0.02 and P= 
0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The three-cycle package encourages couples to have multiple 
treatment cycles, thereby improving their ultimate chances of a live birth. The 
cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates after such a package provide 
a more realistic assessment of overall and age-specific success rates after 
multiple treatment cycles.

PTFE-vein composite grafts for critical limb ischaemia: a valuable alternative 
to all-autogenous infrageniculate reconstructions.

Bastounis E(1), Georgopoulos S, Maltezos C, Alexiou D, Chiotopoulos D, Bramis J.

Author information:

Greece.

OBJECTIVES: to analyse the long-term results of primary composite bypass grafts 
comparing them to PTFE and vein grafts.
DESIGN: a retrospective observational study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: between 1980 and 1996, 568 primary infrageniculate bypass 
procedures were performed; a saphenous-vein graft was used in 428 procedures, a 
PTFE graft in 44 and a composite PTFE-saphenous-vein graft in 96. Thirty-six 
composite grafts were below the knee and the remaining 60 extended more 
distally. Twenty-one bypass grafts from the latter group were sequential. Mean 
follow-up was 45.6 months. Five-year primary and secondary patency and limb 
salvage rates were compared by life-table analysis.
RESULTS: cumulative 5-year primary patency for composite grafts was 58% and for 
saphenous-vein grafts 74%, while secondary patency rate was 75% and 82%, 
respectively (p <0.05). The 5-year limb salvage rate was 80% for composite 
grafts and 88% for saphenous-vein grafts (p >0.05). The primary and secondary 
patency and limb salvage rate for PTFE grafts was 24%, 31% and 40%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Composite grafts of PTFE and saphenous vein are significantly 
superior to PTFE graft alone and should be used in patients who lack sufficient 
length of saphenous vein.

Center and SNS Research, Ohio 45267-0535, USA. Joel.Tsevat@uc.edu

BACKGROUND: Patients infected with HIV value both longevity and health.
OBJECTIVE: To understand how HIV-infected patients value their health.
DESIGN: Interview study.
SETTING: Regional treatment center for HIV.
PATIENTS: 51 patients with HIV infection.
MEASUREMENTS: Life-satisfaction, health rating, time-tradeoff, and 
standard-gamble scores.
RESULTS: Of the 51 patients, 49% (95% CI, 35% to 63%) said that their life was 
better currently than it was before they contracted HIV infection; only 29% said 
that life was currently worse. The mean (+/- SD) time-tradeoff score was 0.95 
+/- 0.10, indicating that, on average, patients would give up no more than 5% of 
their remaining life expectancy in their current state of health in exchange for 
a shorter but healthy life. The average health rating score was 71.0 +/- 18.7 on 
a scale of 0 to 100, and the average standard-gamble score was 0.80 +/- 0.27. 
Factors contributing to life satisfaction and time-tradeoff scores included 
spirituality and having children.
CONCLUSION: Many patients with HIV have a strong will to live, and many feel 
that life with HIV is better than it was before they became infected.

The myth of the in situ graft: superiority in infrainguinal bypass surgery?

Lawson JA(1), Tangelder MJ, Algra A, Eikelboom BC.

Author information:
(1)University Hospital Utrecht, Department of Vascular Surgery, Utrecht, 3508 
GA, PO Box 85500, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: to compare the clinical outcome of in situ and reversed bypass 
grafting.
DESIGN: multicentre, prospective, non-randomised study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: five-hundred patients with an in situ graft and 955 
patients with a reversed graft were compared regarding graft occlusion, the need 
for graft revision, and limb salvage.
RESULTS: two-year assisted primary patency of femoropopliteal bypass procedures 
was 82% for in situ and 82% for reversed grafts. The corresponding hazard ratio 
(HR) for occlusion was 1.27 (95% CI 0. 91-1.77). The 2-year assisted primary 
patency of femorocrural bypass procedures was 69% for in situ vs. 70% for 
reversed grafts. The corresponding HR was 1.13 (95% CI 0.73-1.75). Adjustment 
for relevant baseline variables did not change the results. More reinterventions 
were needed to maintain integrity and patency of the in situ graft especially in 
crural bypasses. No differences in limb salvage rates were seen.
CONCLUSIONS: reversed and in situ vein grafts have similar patency and limb 
salvage rates for both femoropopliteal and femorocrural bypass procedures. The 
in situ graft needs more secondary interventions.

The daf-2 gene network for longevity regulates oxidative stress resistance and 
Mn-superoxide dismutase gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Longevity is regulated by the daf-2 gene network in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Mutations in the daf-2 gene, which encodes a member of the insulin receptor 
family, confer the life extension (Age) phenotype and the constitutive dauer (a 
growth-arrested larval form specialized for dispersal) formation phenotype. The 
Age phenotype is mutually potentiated by two life extension mutations in the 
daf-2 gene and the clk-1 gene, a homologue of yeast CAT5/COQ7 known to regulate 
ubiquinone biosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the daf-2 mutation 
also conferred an oxidative stress resistance (Oxr) phenotype, which was also 
enhanced by the clk-1 mutation. Similar to the Age phenotype, the Oxr phenotype 
was regulated by the genetic pathway of insulin-like signaling from daf-2 to the 
daf-16 gene, a homologue of the HNF-3/forkhead transcription factor. These 
findings led us to examine whether the insulin-like signaling pathway regulates 
the gene expression of antioxidant defense enzymes. We found that the mRNA level 
of the sod-3 gene, which encodes Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), was much higher 
in daf-2 mutants than in the wild type. Moreover, the increased sod-3 gene 
expression phenotype is regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway. 
Although the clk-1 mutant itself did not display Oxr and the increased sod-3 
expression phenotypes, the clk-1 mutation enhanced them in the daf-2 mutant, 
suggesting that clk-1 is involved in longevity in two ways: clk-1 composes the 
original clk-1 longevity program and the daf-2 longevity program. These 
observations suggest that the daf-2 gene network controls longevity by 
regulating the Mn-SOD-associated antioxidant defense system. This system appears 
to play a role in efficient life maintenance at the dauer stage.

BACKGROUND: Patients starting dialysis in old age (age > 70 and > 80) in 
Piedmont are widely increasing: the survival curves of this group of patients 
can give very important information to evaluate the quality of both the 
delivered therapy and our very wide criteria of acceptance to the treatment. To 
this end, using data from the Piedmont Dialysis and Transplant Register, the 
survival curves of patients with age over 70 and 80, beginning dialysis in all 
Piedmont Dialysis Units between 1981 and 1996, have been examined.
METHODS: These curves have been considered both in a general way and according 
to the presence or absence of further high risk conditions; they show results 
better than expected and improving from 1981 to 1995.
RESULTS: If the survival curves of these patients are considered according to 
the kind of dialytic treatment performed, they do not show any significative 
difference.
CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion is drawn that these data strongly support first, the 
fitness of criteria of very wide acceptance to the treatment and modulated 
choice of the kind of dialytic treatment at present followed in Piedmont; and 
second, that dialysis treatment can give very good results also in elderly 
patients. So, it is suggested that the economic and structural difficulties of 
dialysis Units must not influence the nephrologist's choice towards elderly 
patients.

[Article in Italian]

In Italy, as in all industrialized countries, life expectancy is raised during 
the past 100 years; this trend leads to important implications in medicine and 
among nephrologists. The increased number of end stage renal disease patients 
living beyond 65 years, who start dialysis, has modified the typical picture in 
dialysis centers. The causes of this phenomenon are different, including an 
increasing number of chronic diseases, typical of the "third age", like type II 
diabetes mellitus or vascular disease, creation of treatment facilities and 
success of prevention. Besides goods results obtained in elderly dialysis 
patients, mainly due to a better psychological reaction to the treatment and to 
an easy achievement of a high dialytic dose (Kt/V), there are some negative 
aspects, like the hemodynamic intolerance or the difficulties to make an ideal 
vascular access. However, these problems don't discourage the nephrologist but 
rather they must lead to achieve a personalized or alternative treatment. Even 
if the quality of life and rehabilitation are quite acceptable in many elderly 
patients, so to justify the wide acceptance criteria, many ethical and medical 
problems concern the most serious cases. Also in this condition, a wide 
acceptance criteria, followed by a possible withdrawal (time limited trial of 
treatment), can represent a reasonable solution.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
dementias in relation to age, education, sex, and genotype at APOE. Recent 
studies suggest age heterogeneity in the risk of AD associated with the APOE 
genotype and a possible interaction between APOE-epsilon4 and female sex as risk 
factors. We studied these topics in the 5,677 elderly residents of Cache County, 
Utah, a population known for long life expectancy and high participation rates.
METHODS: We screened for dementia with a brief cognitive test and structured 
telephone Dementia Questionnaire, then examined all individuals with apparent 
cognitive symptoms and a sample of others. We estimated age-specific prevalence 
of AD and other dementias and used multiple logistic regression models to 
describe relation of AD prevalence to age, sex, education, and APOE genotype.
RESULTS: We found 335 demented individuals, 230 (69%) with definite, probable, 
or possible AD (positive predictive value versus autopsy confirmation 85%). The 
adjusted prevalence estimate for AD was 6.5% and for all dementias 9.6%. After 
age 90, the adjusted prevalence estimate for AD was 28% and for all dementias 
38%. Regression models showed strong variation in AD prevalence with age, sex, 
education, and number of epsilon4 alleles (effect of epsilon2 not significant). 
Models were improved by a term for age-squared (negative coefficient) and by 
separate terms for interaction of age with presence of one or two epsilon4 
alleles. An association of AD with female sex was ascribable entirely to 
individuals with epsilon4.
CONCLUSIONS: In participants with no epsilon4 alleles, the age-specific 
prevalence of AD reached a maximum and then declined after age 95. In epsilon4 
heterozygotes a similar maximum was noted earlier at age 87, in homozygotes at 
age 73. Female sex was a risk factor for AD only in those with epsilon4. The 
epsilon4 allele accounted for 70% of the population attributable risk for AD.

Survival and infectivity of Hypoderaeum conoideum and Euparyphium albuferensis 
cercariae under laboratory conditions.

Spain. rafael.toledo@uv.es

The survival characteristics of the cercariae of Hypoderaeum conoideum and 
Euparyphium albuferensis (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) at 20 degrees C and 30 
degrees C are described, and the age dependency of their infectivity at 20 
degrees C is studied to determine their respective transmission efficiencies. 
Cercarial survival was found to be age-dependent and was higher at 20 degrees C. 
For both cercariae, the maximum life-span was 26 h at 20 degrees C and 16 h at 
30 degrees C, and their respective times to 50% mortality were similar at each 
temperature. Both cercariae seem to be well adapted to transmission in their 
natural habitat, though cercarial infectivity of H. conoideum was higher than 
that of E. albuferensis, this being correlated with their prevalences in nature. 
The age-dependency of cercarial survival may be related to steadily diminishing 
endogenous energy levels, though the delay in attaining maximum infectivity 
suggests that other factors not related to energy considerations are involved in 
the delimitation of the cercarial infective period. However, this latter 
observation may constitute an adaptative mechanism allowing cercarial 
dissemination.

Income inequality and mortality in England.

Stanistreet D(1), Scott-Samuel A, Bellis MA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, University of Liverpool.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing evidence that income inequality causes 
reductions in life expectancy in developed countries, this relationship has not 
been explored in the United Kingdom, where local income data are not routinely 
available. We have surmounted this problem by employing an ecological design 
which applies national income data to local mortality and occupational data.
METHODS: This ecological, cross-sectional study used 1991 mortality and Census 
data on the 366 English local government districts, and 1991 New Earnings Survey 
data for England, to determine the independent effect of income inequalities 
within English local authorities on the variation in all cause mortality between 
them. The subjects were all men and women recorded as economically active in the 
1991 Census. We carried out linear regression analyses between all cause, all 
ages standardized mortality ratios, income inequality indexes and mean income 
levels of the local government districts. Results Both income inequality and 
mean income were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that income inequality makes an independent 
contribution to life expectancy in English local authorities. This finding adds 
further to the international evidence supporting the potentially positive health 
impact of increasing the scale of redistributive fiscal policies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit of osteoporosis therapy with alendronate, 
estimating the number of patients necessary to treat to prevent a fracture (NNT) 
and the number of prevented fractures (NPF) by treating 100 patients.
METHOD: Analysis of different clinical scenarios from estimations of the 
incidence of osteoporotic fractures in western countries and the decrease in the 
relative risk of fracture obtained in recent clinical trials. Consideration was 
given to the influence of the possible post-therapy residual effects, life 
expectancy and functional impact of fractures.
RESULTS: Results varied largely depending on the fracture risk of patients. 
Under the model assumptions, the NNT for hip fractures ranged from 7 (for women 
aged 80 with a bone mineral density [BMD] with Z < -2) to 333 (for women aged 50 
with Z values ranging from 0 and -1). Thus, therapy of 100 women aged 80 years 
with a Z value < -2 for three years would prevent 14 hip fractures, 33 vertebral 
fractures and 8 wrist fractures. Therapy of 100 women aged 50-55 years with a Z 
value ranging from 0 to -1 would prevent 1 hip fracture, 2 vertebral fractures 
and 2 wrist fractures.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model allows for estimating the expected benefit for 
the different types of patients and underscores the relevance of concentrating 
therapeutic efforts in the groups of patients with the highest risk. On the 
other hand, it suggests that the obtained benefit when treating elderly female 
patients with low BMD is higher than that obtained with therapy during the years 
following menopause.

Has deinstitutionalization gone too far?

Munk-Jørgensen P(1).

Research, Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus, Risskov, Denmark. pmj@psykiatri.aaa.dk

Modern social psychiatry is aiming at integration of the mentally disordered in 
the community instead of institutionalization--with or without institutions. No 
doubt, the majority of mentally disordered patients have benefitted greatly from 
deinstitutionalized psychiatry. Unfortunately, in the implementation of 
deinstitutionalized psychiatry, there has widely been a gap between the closure 
of the mental hospitals and the building up of the decentralized services. 
Instead of organizing decentralized services and then gradually reducing the 
capacity of hospital treatment, things happened in many places the other way 
around. With data from the nationwide Danish Psychiatric Case Register, the 
author documents a series of negative indicators that have appeared parallel 
with the deinstitutionalization process. * 100% increase in standard mortality 
rate of suicides for non-organic psychotic patients * an exponential increase of 
6.7% annually in number of criminal mentally disordered * increase in coercive 
activities in the wards several hundred per cent for some of the measures * 
increase in bed occupancy rate from approximately 80% to 100% * Acute admission 
rates between 85% and 90% * No signs of reduction in 1 year readmission rate of 
first time diagnosed schizophrenics from the very stable 45%-50% which has been 
seen for almost 20 years. Beyond any doubt, social psychiatric rehabilitation is 
needed. An increase in the capacity in the psychiatric services and fitting of 
the treatment models to the patients' needs so that the negative aspects we have 
seen can be properly handled must be on top of the agenda in the next few years.

Healthy dietary habits in relation to social determinants and lifestyle factors.

Johansson L(1), Thelle DS, Solvoll K, Bjørneboe GE, Drevon CA.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of social status and 
lifestyle for dietary habits, since these factors may influence life expectancy. 
We studied the association of four indicators for healthy dietary habits (fruits 
and vegetables, fibre, fat and Hegsted score) with sex, age, socio-economic 
status, education, physical leisure exercise, smoking and personal attention 
paid to keeping a healthy diet. Data were gathered with a self-administered 
quantitative food-frequency questionnaire distributed to a representative sample 
of Norwegian men and women aged 16-79 years in a national dietary survey, of 
whom 3144 subjects (63%) responded. Age and female sex were positively 
associated with indicators for healthy dietary habits. By separate evaluation 
length of education, regular physical leisure exercise and degree of attention 
paid to keeping a healthy diet were positively associated with all four 
indicators for healthy dietary habits in both sexes. Socio-economic status, 
location of residence and smoking habits were associated with from one to three 
indicators for healthy dietary habits. In a multiple regression model, age, 
education and location of residence together explained from 1 to 9% of the 
variation (R2) in the four dietary indicators. Length of education was 
significantly associated with three of four dietary indicators both among men 
and women. By including the variable 'attention paid to keeping a healthy diet' 
in the model, R2 increased to between 4 and 15% for the four dietary indicators. 
Length of education remained correlated to three dietary indicators among women, 
and one indicator among men, after adjusting for attention to healthy diet, age 
and location of residence. Residence in cities remained correlated to two 
indicators among men, but none among women, after adjusting for age, education 
and attention to healthy diet. In conclusion, education was associated with 
indicators of a healthy diet. Attention to healthy diet showed the strongest and 
most consistent association with all four indicators for healthy dietary habits 
in both sexes. This suggests that personal preferences may be just as important 
for having a healthy diet as social status determinants.

Life expectancy following surgery for pituitary tumours.

Bates AS(1), Bullivant B, Sheppard MC, Stewart PM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Birmingham, UK.

OBJECTIVE: Hypopituitarism, predominantly although not exclusively due to 
nonfunctioning pituitary tumours, has been associated with reduced life 
expectancy. Mortality from vascular diseases contributed significantly to the 
overall increase in mortality in some, but not all of the studies published to 
date. The aim of this study was to contribute further data to the debate 
regarding the putative association of vascular mortality with hypopituitarism.
DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A retrospective case note review of patients undergoing 
pituitary surgery in Birmingham, between 1/1/70 and 1/1/92. Subjects were 
identified from neurosurgical and neuropathology records. 348 patients were 
identified of which 197 were male (median age at surgery 48.4, range 11-79 
years) and 151 female (median age at surgery 47.8, range 9-78 years). All cause 
mortality and mortality from vascular disease was compared to the general 
population of the UK using the Person Years computer programme.
RESULTS: There was a small increase in all cause mortality (SMR 1.2; 95% CI 
0.95-1.55), but this was not statistically significant in this study (P = 0.06). 
Mortality from vascular disease was reduced (SMR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-1.1; P = 0.03) 
particularly in the female cohort (SMR 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; P < 0.01) with the 
male subjects having similar mortality to that expected in an age and sex 
matched control population (SMR 0.9; 95% CI 0.5-1.4; P = 0.26).
CONCLUSION: Although patients with pituitary deficiency may be subject to a 
small increase in all cause mortality, the results of this study do not support 
the view that hypopituitarism is associated with a significant increase in 
vascular disease. There is a pressing need for a large prospective study with 
comprehensive data collection, including both endocrine data and information 
regarding clinical outcome, to clarify this issue. In the interim it would seem 
prudent to base the need for GH replacement therapy on quality of life issues 
rather than any potential for increased longevity.

PB, Brasil. antunes@de.ufpb.br

OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of the quality of population data and coverage of 
death statistics for all Federal Brazilian Units by sex in 1990.
METHODS: The population data came from censuses and the recorded death data from 
"Fundação Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística" and the Health 
Ministry. The population data were evaluated by applying classical demographic 
methods. Three techniques were chosen to evaluate the extent of death 
registration coverage.
RESULTS: The degree of precision of the age statement for the majority of the 
Brazilian regions improved the status from "low precision" or "moderate" to 
"precise" during the 80's. The coverage of deaths in 1990 was classified as 
"good" or "satisfactory" for all Federal Units in the South, Southeast and 
Centre-West and for the Northeastern States below Rio Grande do Norte. All the 
remaining states were classified as "regular" or "unsatisfactory".
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant improvement in the quality of the census 
population data and an increase in the coverage of death. It is possible to 
obtain get reliable mortality indicators for many Brazilian States.

de São Paulo, Brasil. mllebr@usp.br

INTRODUCTION: Many changes in the morbidity of patients attended to the 
Country's hospitals have occurred in recent years, wether resulting from 
demographic, epidemiological, financial and technological factors or from those 
related to the structure of the services themselves.
METHODS: The change in diagnoses occurring over this period was analyzed using 
two data banks relating to hospital discharges during 1975 and 1988, in the Vale 
do Paraíba, Southeastern Brazil, taking into account the factors mentioned 
above. Both data banks covered the same variables: hospital, dwelling, patient's 
age and sex, health status at discharge, financing sources, duration of stay and 
main diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among the results were to be found: an ageing of the population of the 
region, with an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in the general and 
infant mortality coefficients, with a proportional diminution of mortality from 
"infectious and parasitic diseases" and an increase in "neoplasms", "diseases of 
the circulatory system" and "injury and poisoning". There was a drop in the 
number of hospitalizations by some diagnostic groups such as "symptoms, signs 
and ill-defined conditions" and "infectious and parasitic diseases" and an 
increase in others, particularly the "neoplasms" and "diseases of the 
circulatory system". There was a shift from the poorly-defined to better defined 
diagnoses, further, there was a decrease in the duration of stay for all groups. 
It was possible to identify some factors which might have caused these changes, 
although there was no one behavioral pattern for all diagnoses.

[Review of surgical cases which have deteriorated over time].

[Article in French]

Farcy JP.

Revision for unacceptable outcomes of surgical spine treatment is not uncommon. 
As a result of extended life expectancy a new group of patients have 
expectations for full range of activities in spite of an ongoing degenerative 
spine process. The higher standards of this population coupled with less 
tolerance toward pain and deformities, no longer well tolerated in the Accident 
resulted in increased demand for surgical treatment. Instruments and techniques 
having been refined in the last 30 years have greatly improved the treatment and 
surgical outcome of spine deformity and spine degeneration however in spite of a 
better understanding of spine biomechanics progress often came via trial and 
error. The study presented here is based upon 154 patients, adolescents and 
adults who underwent revision surgery for a host of problems related to 
malalignment, instability or a combination of both. 102 presented 
decompensations after scoliosis surgery and 52 older adults presented a "failed 
back". Surgical revision is intrusive, requiring osteotomies often via anterior 
and posterior approaches with implantation of new instrumentation aiming for a 
solid arthrodesis. All complications of this revision surgery totaled 23%. 
Results at 5 year 8 months follow up show a 78% patient's improvement. The 
learning points from this experience are to give priority to spine balance and 
junctional zones in planning primary or revision surgery. It is important to 
recognize the place of preventive realignment to prevent further fusion 
extension to the cervical spine or at the opposite side of the spectrum further 
extension to the sacrum.
