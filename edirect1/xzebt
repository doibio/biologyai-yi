The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium distributed in the outermost 
layer of the skin and is intimately involved in the formation of a physical 
barrier to pathogens. Basal keratinocytes possess the properties of stem cells 
and play an essential role in epidermal development and skin damage recovery. 
Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of how basal keratinocytes 
participate in epidermal development and stratification is vital for preventing 
and treating skin lesions. During epidermal morphogenesis, the symmetric 
division of basal keratinocytes contributes to the extension of skin tissues, 
while their asymmetric division and migration facilitate epidermal 
stratification. In this review, we summarize the process of epidermal 
stratification and illustrate the molecular mechanisms underlying epidermal 
morphogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the coordination of multiple signaling 
pathways and transcription factors in epidermal stratification, together with 
the roles of cell polarity and cell dynamics during the process.

Introduction: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a crucial role in bone 
formation and differentiation. Recent RNA-Seq results suggest that BMPs may be 
involved in the sex differentiation of P. sinensis, yet more relevant studies 
about BMPs in P. sinensis are lacking. Methods: Herein, we identified BMP gene 
family members, analyzed the phylogeny, collinear relationship, scaffold 
localization, gene structures, protein structures, transcription factors and 
dimorphic expression by using bioinformatic methods based on genomic and 
transcriptomic data of P. sinensis. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR was used to verify the 
RNA-Seq results and initially explore the function of the BMPs in the sex 
differentiation of P. sinensis. Results: A total of 11 BMP genes were 
identified, 10 of which were localized to their respective genomic scaffolds. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BMP genes were divided into eight 
subfamilies and shared similar motifs ("WII", "FPL", "TNHA", "CCVP", and "CGC") 
and domain (TGF-β superfamily). The results of the sexually dimorphic expression 
profile and qRT-PCR showed that Bmp2, Bmp3, Bmp15l, Bmp5, Bmp6 and Bmp8a were 
significantly upregulated in ovaries, while Bmp2lb, Bmp7, Bmp2bl and Bmp10 were 
remarkable upregulated in testes, suggesting that these genes may play a role in 
sex differentiation of P. sinensis. Discussion: Collectively, our comprehensive 
results enrich the basic date for studying the evolution and functions of BMP 
genes in P. sinensis.

Linkage between working conditions and wellbeing: Insight from migrant and 
native farmhands on Ghana's cocoa farms.

Working conditions and wellbeing (quality of life) could be linked, and they in 
turn enhance social and economic development. Nevertheless, working conditions 
of farmhands have largely been ignored in policy and research. We explored 
working conditions of migrant and native farmhands on Ghana's cocoa farms, and 
implications on wellbeing, using primary data from 600 respondents. 
Multidimensional Poverty Index, Department for International Development 
sustainable livelihood approach, World Food Programme asset score, Zellner's 
seemingly unrelated regression and multinomial logistic regression were adopted. 
Living standards, resilience, health and asset ownership of farmhands were 
generally low. Natives had higher living standards than migrants. However, 
migrants had better food security, and were more resilient to shocks than 
natives. Working and living conditions like years as a farmhand, closeness to 
social amenities, years migrant had stayed in community, type of migrant, being 
joined by a household member, working hours and days, type of agreement, 
category of farmhand, bonuses, satisfaction with working conditions, and income 
influence living standards, resilience, health and asset ownership. Thus, there 
is a link between working conditions and wellbeing of cocoa farmhands. Farmhands 
should be given long-term contracts, bonuses/incentives and personal protective 
equipment (PPE) by cocoa farmers. Government and private agencies should provide 
social amenities/infrastructure in cocoa-growing communities. Farmhands should 
do their own farms and join associations.

Poor sleep quality is recognized as a major risk factor for poor health, 
increasing the incidence of serious chronic diseases. In people with Down 
syndrome, sleep apnea prevalence is significantly greater, it is caused by 
genetic, anatomical, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities. The consequences of 
sleep disruption due to sleep apnea are very serious, especially in terms of 
neurocognitive and cardiovascular effects, leading to reduced life expectancy 
and quality of life in this population. However, the management, care, and 
treatment of related disorders in people with Down syndrome are still inadequate 
and limited. Therefore, this article wants to increase understanding and 
awareness about sleep apnea and the benefits of physical activity in improving 
sleep quality in the Down syndrome community, families, and their care 
specialists.

BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tumor thrombus extension into the 
right atrium (level IV) is a rare life-threatening clinical condition that can 
only be managed by means of a combined urological and cardiac surgical approach. 
The early and late outcomes of this radical treatment were analyzed in a large 
single-institution series over a period of 30 years.
METHODS: In 37 patients with RCC and intracardiac tumor thrombus extension, 
nephrectomy was performed followed by the extraction of the intracaval and 
intracardiac tumor thrombus under direct visual control during deep hypothermic 
circulatory arrest (DHCA). Recently, in 13 patients, selective aortic arch 
perfusion (SAAP) was instituted during DHCA.
RESULTS: In all patients, precise removal of the tumor thrombus was accomplished 
in a bloodless field. The mean duration of isolated DHCA was 15 ± 6 min, and 
31.5 ± 10.2 min in the case of DHCA + SAAP, at a mean hypothermia of 22.7 ± 4°C. 
In-hospital mortality was 7.9% (3 patients). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 
estimated median survival was 26.4 months whereas the 5-year cancer-related 
survival rate was 51%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its complexity, this extensive procedure can be performed 
safely with a generally uneventful postoperative course. The use of 
cardiopulmonary bypass with DHCA, with the advantage of SAAP, allows for a safe, 
precise, and complete extirpation of intracaval and intracardiac tumor mass. 
Late outcomes after radical surgical treatment in patients with RCC and tumor 
thrombus reaching up in the right atrium in our series justify this extensive 
procedure.

Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.

Several factors including gender, age groups, cultures and social conditions may 
affect significantly the risk of diseases and their clinical evolution. 
Unfortunately, little research has been carried out on these aspects and, 
consequently few guidelines or interventions have been implemented. In 
particular, gender is considered a main determinant of inequalities in living 
conditions, access to health services and, thus, in health protection. Focusing 
on the gender gap, we propose an ecological approach to find relationships 
between quantitative indicators of the gender gap dimension, the environmental 
performance index and the life expectancy at birth as summary of human health 
index in 155 countries. We speculated on the consequences of wider gender gaps 
to the population and environmental health. We further explore these 
relationships considering gender gap and environmental aspect subindexes, to 
identify determinants that should be addressed to maximize the One Health 
effect. We found that the gender gap in educational attainment followed by the 
political empowerment were strongly correlated with life expectancy, 
environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. Addressing gender issues, 
particularly the education attainment and political empowerment, can provide 
positive impact beyond the social dimension and the population health, and 
gender should be component of the One Health approach. We recommend gender 
targeted interventions that integrate these aspects into One Health national 
policies.

CONTEXT: Bone metastasis (BM) is a frequent complication of cancer, representing 
the third most common site of secondary spread in solid cancers behind the lung 
and liver. Bone metastasis is found in up to 90% of prostate and breast cancer 
patients. They can cause significant complications, such as pathological 
fractures and paralysis of the spine, which decrease daily functioning and 
quality of life (QoL) and worsen prognosis. The growing life expectancy of 
cancer patients due to improvements in systemic therapies may further increase 
BM's eventuality and clinical burden in cancer patients.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Four physicians from five different specialties were 
interviewed and resumed the most relevant literature of the last 20 years 
focusing on pain treatment in BM patients.
RESULTS: Treatment for BM ideally involves various types of specialists and 
assessments. The disease status and patient background should be considered, 
requiring holistic care and expertise from various medical specialties.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventional, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, and mini-invasive 
techniques can be safe and effective for relieving pain and modifying 
health-related QoL in BM patients.

Biodiversity loss is a major global challenge of the 21st century. Ultimately, 
extinctions of species are determined by birth and death rates; thus, 
conservation management of at-risk species is dependent on robust demographic 
data. In this study, data gathered from 381 (227 females, 154 males) long-finned 
pilot whales (Globicephala melas edwardii) that died in 14 stranding events on 
the New Zealand coast between 2006 and 2017 were used to construct the first 
age- and sex-specific life tables for the subspecies. Survivorship curves were 
fitted to these data using (1) a traditional maximum likelihood approach, and 
(2) Siler's competing-risk model. Life table construction and subsequent 
survival curves revealed distinct differences in the age- and sex-specific 
survival rates, with females outliving males. Both sexes revealed slightly 
elevated rates of mortality among the youngest age-classes (<2 years) with 
postweaning mortality rates decreasing and remaining relatively low until the 
average life expectancy is reached; 11.3 years for males and 14.7 years for 
females. Overall (total) mortality is estimated to be 8.8% and 6.8% per annum 
for males and females, respectively. The mortality curve resembles that of other 
large mammals, with high calf mortality, lower postweaning mortality, and an 
exponentially increasing risk of senescent mortality. An accelerated mortality 
rate was observed in mature females, in contrast to the closely related 
short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus), which selects for an extension to 
the postreproductive life span. The reason for the observed differences in the 
mortality rate acceleration and postreproductive life span between the two pilot 
whale species have not been established and warrant further investigation. 
Obtaining robust information on the life history of long-lived species is 
challenging, but essential to improve our understanding of population dynamics 
and help predict how future pressures may impact populations. This study 
illustrates how demographic data from cetacean stranding events can improve 
knowledge of species survival rates, thus providing essential information for 
conservation management.

Cardiac MRI in Fabry disease.

Umer M(1), Kalra DK(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Cardiology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United 
States.

Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked inherited disorder of 
glycosphingolipid metabolism due to a deficiency of α-galactosidase A enzyme. It 
leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within lysosomes of multiple 
organs, predominantly the vascular, renal, cardiac, and nervous systems. Fabry 
cardiomyopathy is characterized by increased left ventricular wall 
thickness/mass, functional abnormalities, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, 
and heart failure. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to avoid cardiac 
or renal complications that can significantly reduce life expectancy in 
untreated FD. This review will focus on the role of cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance imaging in the diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and monitoring of 
treatment efficacy.

Subjective Well-Being and Active Life Expectancy in Japan: Evidence From a 
Longitudinal Study.

Minagawa Y(1), Saito Y(2).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Existing research has suggested that older adults in 
Japan enjoy phenomenal physical health status, but they have poor subjective 
well-being (SWB). Limited empirical evidence exists, however, on how physical 
health and SWB intersect and are linked to the lives of older men and women in 
Japan. Using the concept of health expectancy, this study examines the role of 
SWB, as measured by life satisfaction, in the mortality and morbidity 
experiences of Japanese adults aged 65 years and older.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the nationally representative Nihon 
University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging, 1999-2009. Our measurement of 
morbidity is disability, based on difficulty in activities in daily living 
(ADLs) and instrumental ADLs. We use the Interpolation of Markov Chains approach 
to compute life expectancy (LE), LE without disability (active LE), and LE with 
differing severity of disability for those who are satisfied with life and for 
those who are not.
RESULTS: We documented significant differences in LE and active LE by the state 
of life satisfaction among older adults in Japan. Men and women who are 
satisfied with life are expected to live longer and spend more years without 
having disability compared to those who are not satisfied. We found no 
differences in the length of life with disability of differing severity by the 
state of life satisfaction.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results highlight the important role of SWB at 
older ages in Japan, because it is directly related to the physical health of 
its aging population. Fully understanding the health of the older population 
requires research that focuses on both objective and subjective dimensions of 
well-being.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disease of connective tissue 
characterized by the loss of bone density and mass, which increases the 
fragility of the bones, thus presenting multiple fractures throughout the years 
followed by bone deformity and articular instability. This condition has various 
clinical presentations. We present four cases of OI, one case with type I, two 
cases with type II, and one case with type III. The clinical diagnosis in most 
of the cases was clinical; only one of them was confirmed with genomic sequence. 
The treatment of these cases was based on medication, orthopedic surgery, and 
recovery and physical therapy. The evolution was torpid in these cases but with 
prolonged life expectancy despite the severity and type of OI. It is important 
to highlight that the patients did not have a neurocognitive compromise. Early 
diagnosis and multidisciplinary medical management are crucial in obtaining 
better outcomes for this disease, improving the quality of life, and avoiding 
complications.

BACKGROUND: The UNC13A gene is an established susceptibility locus for 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a determinant of shorter survival after 
disease onset, with up to 33.0 months difference in life expectancy for carriers 
of the rs12608932 risk genotype. However, its overall effect on other clinical 
features and ALS phenotypic variability is controversial.
METHODS: Genotype data of the UNC13A rs12608932 SNP (A-major allele; C-minor 
allele) was obtained from a cohort of 972 ALS patients. Demographic and clinical 
variables were collected, including cognitive and behavioral profiles, evaluated 
through the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) - Italian 
version and the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI); upper and lower motor neuron 
involvement, assessed by the Penn Upper Motor Neuron Score (PUMNS) and the Lower 
Motor Neuron Score (LMNS)/Medical Research Council (MRC) scores, respectively; 
the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) score at evaluation and 
progression rate; age and site of onset; survival. The comparison between the 
three rs12608932 genotypes (AA, AC, and CC) was performed using the additive, 
dominant, and recessive genetic models.
RESULTS: The rs12608932 minor allele frequency was 0.31 in our ALS cohort, in 
comparison to 0.33-0.41 reported in other Caucasian ALS populations. Carriers of 
at least one minor C allele (AC + CC genotypes) had a shorter median survival 
than patients with the wild-type AA genotype (-11.7 months, p = 0.013), even 
after adjusting for age and site of onset, C9orf72 mutational status and gender. 
Patients harboring at least one major A allele (AA + AC genotypes) and 
particularly those with the wild-type AA genotype showed a significantly higher 
PUMNS compared to CC carriers (p = 0.015 and padj = 0.037, respectively), thus 
indicating a more severe upper motor neuron involvement. Our analysis did not 
detect significant associations with all the other clinical parameters 
considered.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings confirm the role of UNC13A as a determinant of

The age range 45-64 covers a life-stage when ideally, health status is 
reasonably manageable. However, this life-stage also poses health risks, which 
may lead to diseases, illnesses, dysfunctions, disabilities and early death. In 
fact, over the last three years, life expectancy among non-Hispanic white men 
has decreased. The opportunity to synergize ethics, health and well-being at the 
individual and group/community level is also highlighted. Various sphere of 
ethics and how they impact on individual, group/community well-being 
strategically, infuses ethics into health and health care conversations. 
Difficult term to operationalize like well-being, health, ethics and healing are 
deliberated. The phrase "70 is the new 50" reflects an importance opportunity to 
discuss what it means to be middle age and be healthy. There are health threats 
created by social and environment injustices and food deserts which are 
important considerations influencing health. The concept of Optimal Health, as a 
group strategy to advance health, particularly for people of African descent, 
details five group domains: optimal physical, emotional, social-economic, 
intellectual, and spiritual health. Optimal Health translated into individual 
behavior also has five health promotion principles that are detailed in the 
article. Synergizing Optimal Health, at the group/community level, with the five 
Health Promotion Principles, at the individual level, is the ideal journey 
toward individual and group/community well-being. Persons ages 45-64 are poised 
to combine the wisdom gained from their lived experiences, with the knowledge 
acquired from their positive or negative interfaces with the health delivery 
system, are generously available to achieve Optimal Health. The article 
concludes by discussing the Ancient African Imhotep, True Father of Medicine, 
2980 B.C.E.

OBJECTIVES: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disorder 
encompassing facial and oral telangiectasias and visceral vascular malformations 
(VMs). Pulmonary VMs can lead to paradoxical embolism of thrombi or bacteria, 
e.g., due to dental procedures. Early detection can reduce morbidity and 
mortality and is recommended. However, diagnosis is often delayed for decades. 
Our study is assessing the feasibility and effect of a nationwide awareness 
campaign for early diagnosis of HHT addressing all dentists in Germany.
METHODS: In 2018, one article and two reminders about HHT were published in a 
nationwide awareness campaign. As a proxy for the effectiveness of the campaign, 
researchers measured the number of first-time inquiries from patients and 
physicians about HHT documented by the German HHT self-help group from September 
2016 until September 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 411 first contacts with the German self-help group were 
documented, mainly via Internet platforms (Internet forum (n = 130) and 
Facebook® (n = 189)). For 9% of those patients (n = 36/411), the physician or 
dentist (physician: (n = 31/36, 86%; dentist: n = 5/36, 14%) informed patients 
about the disease HHT and the self-help group. Before publishing the first 
article about HHT, no dentist referred patients to the German self-help group; 
afterwards, 5 patients received information about HHT from their dentist and 
contacted the patient organization for the first time. After each publication in 
June, September, and December 2018, the number of new contacts increased. 
Contacts via phone and e-mail had the highest relative increase.
CONCLUSIONS: The repeated call for dental screening for HHT in Germany led to 
increased awareness of this rare disease; more patients with possible HHT 
received information about the condition. The authors conclude that targeted 
campaigns may contribute to a shorter diagnostic latency resulting in increased 
quality of life and life expectancy in HHT. This trial is registered with 
CT03549949.

With the increasing threat of metabolic syndromes, a focus on maintaining kidney 
health from early- to mid-adulthood is necessary. This study elucidates 
mortality risk and years of life lost (YLLs) due to abnormal renal function. 
This was a retrospective, matched cohort study from health checkup data from 
2000 to 2015. We identified 12,774 participants with abnormal renal function 
(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and used propensity score matching to identify 25,548 
participants with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 60). YLLs were estimated using 
the life expectancy differences between the abnormal and matched normal cohorts. 
Cox models were used to estimate the adjusted mortality risk. The estimated life 
expectancy of participants with proteinuria and eGFR < 60 was 26.24 years, with 
a 95 % confidence interval of (23.96, 29.36), 17.62 (16.37, 18.78), and 11.70 
(11.02, 12.46) for age groups of 30 - 54, 55 - 64, and 65 - 79 years, 
respectively. The estimated YLLs of participants with proteinuria and eGFR < 60, 
as compared with the matched normal cohort, were 17.86 (13.41, 20.36), 12.55 
(11.41, 13.78), and 8.31 (7.47, 9.13) years for the three age groups, 
respectively. The Cox model estimates of mortality hazard ratios of participants 
having proteinuria and eGFR < 60 against matched referents were 5.29 (3.97, 
7.05), 3.99 (3.34, 4.75), and 3.05 (2.62, 3.55) for the three age groups, 
respectively. Abnormal renal function shortens life expectancy, particularly in 
patients with proteinuria and in younger adults. Active health management of 
renal function can reduce the disease burden.

This study investigates the efficacy of and gender differences in exercise 
therapy in patients with malignant lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy. Twenty-six 
patients (13 men, 13 women) received physical therapy (based on the Borg Scale 
13) during hospitalization. Physical function was measured using grip and knee 
extension strength, 6-minute walking distance, and body composition; nutritional 
status assessed via Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA®); and serum albumin levels 
analyzed. Fatigue was evaluated using the Brief Fatigue Inventory, and 
health-related quality of life was assessed with the Medical Outcome Study 
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36v2). The analysis of all patients 
indicated that the right grip strength, skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle 
index, and leg muscle mass significantly decreased, whereas the serum albumin 
level, MNA® score, and scores of many items of the SF-36v2 significantly 
increased after chemotherapy. In a gender-specific analysis, only men showed 
significant declines in the skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle index, and 
improvement in the MNA® score after chemotherapy. In the SF-36v2, there were 
significant improvements in general health and physical component summary scores 
among men, and general health and mental component summary scores among women. 
Exercise therapy at a Borg Scale intensity of 13 may not prevent muscle mass 
decline in patients with malignant lymphoma, especially male patients. In 
addition, this study revealed that there is a gender difference in the effect of 
exercise therapy on quality of life. Thus, gender should be considered in 
exercise therapy for patients with malignant lymphoma.

The human life span has been markedly extended since the 1900s, but it has not 
brought healthy aging to everyone. This increase in life expectancy without an 
increase in healthspan is a major global concern that imposes considerable 
health care budgets and degrades the quality of life of older adults. Dietary 
interventions are a promising strategy to increase healthspan. In this study, we 
evaluated whether a Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit ethanol extract (GFE) 
increases the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Treatment with 
10 mg/mL GFE increased the life span by 27.1% when compared to the vehicle 
group. GFE (10 mg/mL) treatment improved healthspan-related markers (pharyngeal 
pumping, muscle quality, age-pigment, and reactive oxygen species accumulation) 
and exerted a protective effect against amyloid β 1-42 toxicity. These effects 
of GFE are related to the inhibition of insulin/IGF-1 signaling and activation 
of SKN-1/Nrf, thereby promoting the expression of stress resistance-related 
genes. In addition, treatment with 10 mM geniposide, the most abundant component 
of GFE, improved healthspan-related markers and increased life span by 18.55% 
when compared to the vehicle group. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
that GFE and its component geniposide increase the life span along with 
healthspan in C. elegans.

Anthropogenic climate change will have a detrimental impact on global health, 
including the direct impact of higher ambient temperatures. Existing projections 
of heat-related health outcomes in a changing climate often consider increasing 
ambient temperatures alone. Population growth and structure has been identified 
as a key source of uncertainty in future projections. Age acts as a modifier of 
heat risk, with heat-risk generally increasing in older age-groups. In many 
countries the population is ageing as lower birth rates and increasing life 
expectancy alter the population structure. Preparing for an older population, in 
particular in the context of a warmer climate should therefore be a priority in 
public health research and policy. We assess the level of inclusion of 
population growth and demographic changes in research projecting exposure to 
heat and heat-related health outcomes. To assess the level of inclusion of 
population changes in the literature, keyword searches of two databases were 
implemented, followed by reference and citation scans to identify any missed 
papers. Relevant papers, those including a projection of the heat health burden 
under climate change, were then checked for inclusion of population scenarios. 
Where sensitivity to population change was studied the impact of this on 
projections was extracted. Our analysis suggests that projecting the heat health 
burden is a growing area of research, however, some areas remain understudied 
including Africa and the Middle East and morbidity is rarely explored with most 
studies focusing on mortality. Of the studies pairing projections of population 
and climate, specifically SSPs and RCPs, many used pairing considered to be 
unfeasible. We find that not including any projected changes in population or 
demographics leads to underestimation of health burdens of on average 64 %. 
Inclusion of population changes increased the heat health burden across all but 
two studies.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage 
chronic kidney disease. It improves quality of life and increases life 
expectancy. At present, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world does 
not practice kidney transplantation; thus, patients continue to be referred to 
other countries for transplantation.
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the 
Nephrology Department of the National Hospital Amirou Boubacar Diallo in Niamey, 
Niger over a 5-month period. It included all patients that had benefited from 
kidney transplantation with the aim to evaluate patient and graft survival.
RESULTS: We identified 25 patients. The male to female ratio was 2:1. The 
average age was 45.4 years ± 11.1 years. The average age of donors was 36.1 
years ± 12.6 years with a clear male predominance (17 males to 8 females); all 
of them were related-donors with 72% of them being brothers or sisters. The 
causative nephropathy was undetermined in 80% of patients. Sixty-four percent of 
patients had their kidney transplant in Maghreb, including 16% in Tunisia. The 
complications were mostly medical (68%), as 20% were immunologic; 8% infectious; 
16% metabolic; 20% cardiovascular, and 4% were related to recurrence of the 
initial nephropathy. Surgical complications involved 6 patients (24%): 5 were 
vascular cases and one was a urological case. With a median follow-up of 5 
years, the patients' survival was 84%, the graft survival was 56%, and 
death-censored graft survival was 67%.
CONCLUSION: In Niger, after kidney transplantation, the patients' survival is 
satisfactory, whereas the graft survival is not, mostly due to inadequate 
follow-up check-ups and prohibitive prices of immunosuppressants.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the survival rate, postoperative 
complications, and walking ability in cemented hemiarthroplasty (HA) for 
displaced femoral neck fractures according to the anaesthesia method.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a multicentre group (the TRON 
group). Three hundred fifty-eight patients who underwent cemented HA between 
2015 and 2019 were selected; 289 patients of ≥75 years of age with no missing 
data were included. Patient background factors were matched and patients were 
assigned to spinal anaesthesia (SA) and general anaesthesia (GA) groups. The 
primary outcome was death at any time during the follow-up period. Secondary 
outcomes included postoperative complications and walking ability assessed using 
the Parker mobility score (PMS). Overall survival was evaluated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared using the log-rank test. The 
incidence of each complication and PMS were compared between the two groups 
using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Overall survival during follow-up was significantly higher in the SA
