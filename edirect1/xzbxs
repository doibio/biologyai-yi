burden of poor health experienced by populations in the less wealthy regions of 
Brazil. To mitigate the effects of social exclusion, the development of 
strategies at the regional level is essential to provide health care to all 
persons in need, reduce risk exposures, support prevention policies for adoption 
of healthy behaviors. Such strategies should prioritize population groups that 
will experience the greatest impact from such interventions.

INTRODUCTION: There is a 10-year gap in life expectancy between Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal Australians. The leading cause of death for Aboriginal 
Australians is cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and 
stroke. Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is a known precursor to stroke there 
are no published studies about the prevalence of AF for Aboriginal people and 
limited evidence about AF in indigenous populations globally.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This mixed methods study will recruit and train Aboriginal 
health workers to use an iECG device attached to a smartphone to consecutively 
screen 1500 Aboriginal people aged 45 years and older. The study will quantify 
the proportion of people who presented for follow-up assessment and/or treatment 
following a non-normal screening and then estimate the prevalence and age 
distribution of AF of the Australian Aboriginal population. The study includes 
semistructured interviews with the Aboriginal health workers about the 
effectiveness of the iECG device in their practice as well as their perceptions 
of the acceptability of the device for their patients. Thematic analysis will be 
undertaken on the qualitative data collected in the study. If the device and 
approach are acceptable to the Aboriginal people and widely adopted, it may help 
prevent the effects of untreated AF including ischaemic stroke and early deaths 
or impairment in Aboriginal people.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This mixed methods study received ethics approval from 
the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (1135/15) and the Australian 
Health Council of Western Australia (HREC706). Ethics approval is being sought 
in the Northern Territory. The findings of this study will be shared with 
Aboriginal communities, in peer reviewed publications and at conferences. There 
are Aboriginal investigators in each state/territory where the study is being 
conducted who have been actively involved in the study. They will also be 
involved in data analysis, dissemination and research translation.

Background and study aims: Colitis-associated cancer/dysplasia (CC/D) can affect 
the life expectancy of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the 
utility of magnifying chromocolonoscopy has been shown, the use of optical 
magnification with narrow band imaging (NBI) for distinguishing CC/D from 
non-neoplastic lesions in patients with UC has not been reported. We evaluated 
whether endoscopic findings are distinguishing and thus assessed the clinical 
usefulness of NBI magnification for differentiating UC-associated lesions. 
Patients and methods: The study involved 27 patients diagnosed and treated at 
Hiroshima University Hospital between September 2005 and March 2015: a neoplasia 
group (16 lesions) and a non-neoplasia group (17 lesions). The neoplasias 
comprised 9 dysplastic lesions, 5 intramucosal carcinomas, and 2 submucosal 
carcinomas, and 17 non-neoplastic lesions. Targeted biopsy samples of suspicious 
lesions detected by conventional colonoscopy were classified pathologically as 
neoplastic or non-neoplastic, and NBI magnifying colonoscopy findings (i. e., 
the surface [unclear/regular/irregular/amorphous] and vascular [same as the 
background mucosa/regular/irregular/avascular] patterns) of the 2 lesion types 
were compared. Results: Irregular/amorphous surface patterns were significantly 
more common in neoplastic lesions than in non-neoplastic lesions (81 % [13/16] 
vs. 18 % [3/17], respectively, P < 0.001). Irregular/avascular vessel pattern 
tended to be more common in neoplastic lesions (75 % [12/16] vs. 41 % [7/17], 
respectively). The surface pattern correctly predicted 82 % of neoplastic 
lesions, and the vessel pattern correctly predicted 67 % of non-neoplastic 
lesions. The 2 endoscopic findings together correctly predicted 91 % of 
neoplastic lesions. Conclusion: Surface pattern, determined by magnifying 
colonoscopy with NBI, is useful for differenting between UC-associated 
neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.

BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complex, neurodevelopmental 
genetic disorder that is associated with hyperphagia and morbid obesity in 
humans and leads to a shortened life expectancy. This report summarizes the 
primary causes of death and evaluates mortality trends in a large cohort of 
individuals with PWS.
METHODS: The US Prader-Willi Syndrome Association (PWSA (USA)) syndrome-specific 
database of death reports was collected through a cursory bereavement program 
for PWSA (USA) families using a brief survey created in 1999. Causes of death 
were descriptively characterized and statistically examined using Cox 
proportional hazards.
RESULTS: A total of 486 deaths were reported (263 males, 217 females, 6 unknown) 
between 1973 and 2015, with mean age of 29.5 ± 16 years (2 months-67 years); 70% 
occurred in adulthood. Respiratory failure was the most common cause, accounting 
for 31% of all deaths. Males were at increased risk for presumed 
hyperphagia-related accidents/injuries and cardiopulmonary factors compared to 
females. PWS maternal disomy 15 genetic subtype showed an increased risk of 
death from cardiopulmonary factors compared to the deletion subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the heightened vulnerability to obesity 
and hyperphagia-related mortality in PWS. Future research is needed to address 
critical vulnerabilities such as gender and genetic subtype in the cause of 
death in PWS.Genet Med advance online publication 17 November 2016.

INTRODUCTION: Heart disease and cancer are the first and second leading causes 
of death in the United States. Age-standardized death rates (risk) have declined 
since the 1960s for heart disease and for cancer since the 1990s, whereas the 
overall number of heart disease deaths declined and cancer deaths increased. We 
analyzed mortality data to evaluate and project the effect of risk reduction, 
population growth, and aging on the number of heart disease and cancer deaths to 
the year 2020.
METHODS: We used mortality data, population estimates, and population 
projections to estimate and predict heart disease and cancer deaths from 1969 
through 2020 and to apportion changes in deaths resulting from population risk, 
growth, and aging.
RESULTS: We predicted that from 1969 through 2020, the number of heart disease 
deaths would decrease 21.3% among men (-73.9% risk, 17.9% growth, 34.7% aging) 
and 13.4% among women (-73.3% risk, 17.1% growth, 42.8% aging) while the number 
of cancer deaths would increase 91.1% among men (-33.5% risk, 45.6% growth, 
79.0% aging) and 101.1% among women (-23.8% risk, 48.8% growth, 76.0% aging). We 
predicted that cancer would become the leading cause of death around 2016, 
although sex-specific crossover years varied.
CONCLUSION: Risk of death declined more steeply for heart disease than cancer, 
offset the increase in heart disease deaths, and partially offset the increase 
in cancer deaths resulting from demographic changes over the past 4 decades. If 
current trends continue, cancer will become the leading cause of death by 2020.

[Ageing and Alzheimer disease - system dynamics model prediction].

[Article in Czech]

Tomášková H, Kühnová J, Kuča K.

The aim of the paper is to describe asystem dynamics model applied on 
aprediction of the number of patients with Alzheimers disease in the EU in the 
future and related financial impacts. Dementia resulting from Alzheimers disease 
is the most widely spread type of dementia and is highly connected with the age 
of the person - the patient. Most people are diagnosed with Alzheimers disease 
when they are older than 64. The ageing of population will be an ongoing problem 
in the next few decades due to alow birth rate and increasing life expectancy. 
This is areason to focus on prediction models of Alzheimers disease and its 
impact on economy. The paper presents adynamic modelling approach of system 
dynamics. The created model of the EU population and patients with AD is 
expanded by afinancial submodel at the end. This submodel estimates the cost on 
patients from three available cost studies.Key words: systém dynamic Alzhimers 
disease population ageing.

    Am J Public Health. 2017 Jan;107(1):17-18.

OBJECTIVES: To more clearly articulate, and more graphically demonstrate, the 
impact of poverty on various health outcomes and social conditions by comparing 
the poorest counties to the richest counties in the United States and to other 
countries in the world.
METHODS: We used 5-year averages for median household income to form the 3141 US 
counties into 50 new "states"-each representing 2% of the counties in the United 
States (62 or 63 counties each). We compared the poorest and wealthiest 
"states."
RESULTS: We documented dramatic and statistically significant differences in 
life expectancy, smoking rates, obesity rates, and almost every other measure of 
health and well-being between the wealthiest and poorest "states" in the 
country. The populations of more than half the countries in the world have a 
longer life expectancy than do US persons living in the poorest "state."
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis graphically demonstrates the true impact of the 
extreme socioeconomic disparities that exist in the United States. These 
differences can be obscured when one looks only at state data, and suggest that 
practitioners and policymakers should increasingly focus interventions to 
address the needs of the poorest citizens in the United States.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of collaborative care 
(vs usual care) for treating depression in patients with diabetes and/or 
coronary heart disease (CHD).
SETTING: 36 primary care general practices in North West England.
PARTICIPANTS: 387 participants completed baseline assessment (collaborative 
care: 191; usual care: 196) and full or partial 4-month follow-up data were 
captured for 350 (collaborative care: 170; usual care: 180). 62% of participants 
were male, 14% were non-white. Participants were aged ≥18 years, listed on a 
Quality and Outcomes Framework register for CHD and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes 
mellitus, with persistent depressive symptoms. Patients with psychosis or type 
I/II bipolar disorder, actively suicidal, in receipt of services for substance 
misuse, or already in receipt of psychological therapy for depression were 
excluded.
INTERVENTION: Collaborative care consisted of evidence-based low-intensity 
psychological treatments, delivered over 3 months and case management by a 
practice nurse and a Psychological Well Being Practitioner.
OUTCOME MEASURES: As planned, the primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY)). A Markov model was constructed to extrapolate the trial results from 
short-term to long-term (24 months).
RESULTS: The mean cost per participant of collaborative care was £317 (95% CI 
284 to 350). Over 24 months, it was estimated that collaborative care was 
associated with greater healthcare usage costs (net cost £674 (95% CI -30 953 to 
38 853)) and QALYs (net QALY gain 0.04 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.54)) than usual care, 
resulting in a cost per QALY gained of £16 123, and a likelihood of being 
cost-effective of 0.54 (willingness to pay threshold of £20 000).
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care is a potentially cost-effective long-term 
treatment for depression in patients with comorbid physical and mental illness. 
The estimated cost per QALY gained was below the threshold recommended by 
English decision-makers. Further, long-term primary research is needed to 
address uncertainty associated with estimates of cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia have significantly shorter life 
expectancy than the general population, and a problem they commonly face is an 
unhealthy lifestyle, which can lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome. There is 
a very clear need to determine the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus which are components of metabolic syndrome 
in patients with schizophrenia, but there has been a paucity of large-scale 
studies examining this situation in Japan. The aim of our study was to address 
this need.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a large-scale investigation of the 
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus using 
a questionnaire in 520 outpatient facilities and 247 inpatient facilities of the 
Japan Psychiatric Hospitals Association between January 2012 and July 2013. 
There were 7,655 outpatients and 15,461 inpatients with schizophrenia.
RESULTS: The outpatients had significantly higher prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyper-LDL cholesterolemia, and diabetes 
mellitus than the inpatients. The prevalence of hypo-HDL cholesterolemia was 
higher in inpatients than outpatients. Age-specific analysis showed the 
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyper-LDL 
cholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus among outpatients to be 2- to 3-fold 
higher than among inpatients. In individuals aged ≥60 years, the prevalence of 
obesity and DM among outpatients was about 3-fold higher than among inpatients.
CONCLUSION: Japanese outpatients with schizophrenia were more likely to have 
physical risk such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes 
mellitus than inpatients. The physical risk to patients with schizophrenia may 
be affected by environmental parameters, such as type of care. The physical risk 
to Japanese patients with schizophrenia demands greater attention.

Despite the rapid development of therapeutic strategies, leukemia remains a type 
of difficult-to-treat hematopoietic malignancy that necessitates introduction of 
more effective treatment options to improve life expectancy and quality of 
patients. Genetic engineering in adoptively transferred T cells to express 
antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has proved highly powerful 
and efficacious in inducing sustained responses in patients with refractory 
malignancies, as exemplified by the success of CD19-targeting CAR-T treatment in 
patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recent strategies, 
including manipulating intracellular activating domains and transducing viral 
vectors, have resulted in better designed and optimized CAR-T cells. This is 
further facilitated by the rapid identification of an accumulating number of 
potential leukemic antigens that may serve as therapeutic targets for CAR-T 
cells. This review will provide a comprehensive background and scrutinize recent 
important breakthrough studies on anti-leukemia CAR-T cells, with focus on 
recently identified antigens for CAR-T therapy design and approaches to overcome 
critical challenges.

OBJECTIVE: This review explores the evidence from the literature regarding how 
meta-health effects (effects other than health resulting from the consumption of 
health care) are valued for use in economic evaluations.
METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature (the EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit and SocINDEX databases were searched for publications 
in March 2016, plus manual searching) investigated the associations between 
study methods and the resulting values for meta-health effects estimated for use 
in economic evaluations. The review considered which meta-health effects were 
being valued and how this differed by evaluation approach, intervention 
investigated, source of funds and year of publication. Detailed reasons for 
differences observed between values for comparable meta-health effects were 
explored, accounting for the method of valuation.
RESULTS: The search of the literature revealed 71 studies of interest; 35% 
involved drug interventions, with convenience, information and process of care 
the three meta-health effects most often investigated. Key associations with the 
meta-health effects were the evaluation method, the intervention, and the source 
of funds. Relative values for meta-health effects ranged from 0.9% to 68% of the 
overall value reported in a study. For a given meta-health effect, the magnitude 
of the effect evaluated and how the meta-health effect was described and framed 
relative to overall health explained the differences in relative values.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the literature shows variability in how meta-health 
effects are being measured for use in economic evaluations. Understanding the 
sources of that variability is important if decision makers are to have 
confidence in how meta-health effects are valued.

Understanding the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and 
services has been a central issue in ecology. Experiments in synthetic 
communities suggest that biodiversity loss may erode a set of ecosystem 
functions, but studies in natural communities indicate that the effects of 
biodiversity loss are usually weak and that multiple functions can be sustained 
by relatively few species. Yet, the mechanisms by which natural ecosystems are 
able to maintain multiple functions in the face of diversity loss remain poorly 
understood. With a long-term and large-scale removal experiment in the Inner 
Mongolian grassland, here we showed that losses of plant functional groups 
(PFGs) can reduce multiple ecosystem functions, including biomass production, 
soil NO3 -N use, net ecosystem carbon exchange, gross ecosystem productivity, 
and ecosystem respiration, but the magnitudes of these effects depended largely 
on which PFGs were removed. Removing the two dominant PFGs (perennial 
rhizomatous grasses and perennial bunchgrasses) simultaneously resulted in 
dramatic declines in all examined functions, but such declines were circumvented 
when either dominant PFG was present. We identify the major mechanism for this 
as a compensation effect by which each dominant PFG can mitigate the losses of 
others. This study provides evidence that compensation ensuing from PFG losses 
can mitigate their negative consequence, and thus natural communities may be 
more resilient to biodiversity loss than currently thought if the remaining PFGs 
have strong compensation capabilities. On the other hand, ecosystems without 
well-developed compensatory functional diversity may be much more vulnerable to 
biodiversity loss.

Life span and aging are substantially modified by natural selection. Across 
species, higher extrinsic (environmentally related) mortality (and hence shorter 
life expectancy) selects for the evolution of more rapid aging. However, among 
populations within species, high extrinsic mortality can lead to extended life 
span and slower aging as a consequence of condition-dependent survival. Using 
within-species contrasts of eight natural populations of Nothobranchius fishes 
in common garden experiments, we demonstrate that populations originating from 
dry regions (with short life expectancy) had shorter intrinsic life spans and a 
greater increase in mortality with age, more pronounced cellular and 
physiological deterioration (oxidative damage, tumor load), and a faster decline 
in fertility than populations from wetter regions. This parallel intraspecific 
divergence in life span and aging was not associated with divergence in early 
life history (rapid growth, maturation) or pace-of-life syndrome (high metabolic 
rates, active behavior). Variability across four study species suggests that a 
combination of different aging and life-history traits conformed with or 
contradicted the predictions for each species. These findings demonstrate that 
variation in life span and functional decline among natural populations are 
linked, genetically underpinned, and can evolve relatively rapidly.

event.

This study aims to examine (a) the time course of stress, fatigue, and sleep 
quality among PhD students awaiting a stressful event and (b) whether daily 
anticipation of this event influences day-level stress, fatigue, and sleep 
quality. Forty-four PhD students completed evening and morning questionnaires on 
eight days from 1 month before their dissertation defense until one month 
thereafter. Results showed increased stress leading up to the defense, while 
fatigue and sleep quality remained unchanged. Comparing the night before the 
defense with the night after, stress rapidly decreased, whereas fatigue and 
sleep quality increased. Following the defense, stress and sleep quality 
remained stable, whereas fatigue declined. Stress 1 month before the defense was 
higher than 1 month thereafter. Regarding day-level relations, stress was 
adversely affected by negative anticipation and favorably by positive outcome 
expectancy, whereas positive anticipation had no influence. Positive outcome 
expectancy was an important predictor of improved sleep quality. We conclude 
that stress may be elevated long before a stressful event takes place but that 
one can recover rather quickly from temporary stress. Positive outcome 
expectancy of a stressful event may be an important predictor of reduced 
day-level stress and improved day-level sleep quality leading up to a stressful 
event.

Guidelines for diabetes care recommend that physicians select individualized 
glycemic goals based on life expectancy, diabetes duration, comorbidity, and 
resources/support. When patients have stable hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels, 
guidelines lack recommendations on when diabetes medications should be 
de-intensified.To understand physicians' perspectives on de-intensifying 
diabetes medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.Cross-sectional survey, 
(February-June, 2015).Academic medical center and suburban integrated health 
system.Primary care and endocrinology physicians.Physicians' self-reported: 
awareness, agreement, and frequency of individualizing HbA1C goals; practice of 
de-intensifying diabetes medications; HbA1C values at which physicians 
de-intensify diabetes medications; and other patient factors physicians consider 
when de-intensifying diabetes medications.Response rate was 73% (156/213). Most 
physicians (78%) responded they were familiar with recommendations to 
individualize HbA1C goals. For patients with stable HbA1C levels, 80% of 
physicians reported they had initiated conversations about stopping medications; 
however, physicians differed in predefined HbA1C levels used to initiate 
conversations (HbA1C < 5.7%: 14%; HbA1C < 6.0%: 31%; HbA1C < 6.5%: 22%; 
individualized level: 21%). In multiple logistic regression, women physicians 
(odds ratio [OR] 3.0; confidence interval [CI] 1.1-8.2; P = 0.03) and physicians 
practicing fewer than 20 years (OR 2.8; CI 1.01-7.7; P = 0.048) were more likely 
to report de-intensifying diabetes medications.Individualizing glycemic goals 
and de-intensifying treatments are concepts well accepted by physicians in our 
sample. However, physicians vary considerably in reporting how they carry out 
recommendations to individualize and may be missing opportunities to stop or 
taper diabetes medications based on patients' individualized glycemic goals.

Comparison of Treatment Outcomes in Partially Edentulous Patients with 
Implant-Supported Fixed Prostheses and Removable Partial Dentures.

Nogawa T, Takayama Y, Ishida K, Yokoyama A.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare masticatory performance, occlusal 
force, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in patients with 
mandibular distal-extension edentulism between those with implant-supported 
fixed prostheses (ISFPs) and those with removable partial dentures (RPDs), and 
to evaluate relationships among them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were recruited from patients using ISFPs or RPDs 
for mandibular distal-extension edentulism. Masticatory performance was 
evaluated based on the glucose extracted from chewed gummy jelly. Occlusal force 
was measured with a pressure-sensitive sheet, and data were subjected to 
computer analysis. The Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile 
(OHIP-J) was used to evaluate OHRQoL. The masticatory performance, occlusal 
force, and OHIP-J scores of the ISFP and RPD groups were compared using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The relationships among the variables were analyzed 
using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient test. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was employed with the OHIP-J score as a dependent variable.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients with ISFPs and 25 patients with RPDs participated in 
this study. No significant difference was observed between the two groups with 
regard to masticatory performance and occlusal force. The OHIP-J score was 
significantly lower in the ISFP group than in the RPD group. The OHIP-J score 
had no significant correlation with masticatory performance, but was 
significantly correlated with occlusal force and the prosthetic method. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that younger age, RPDs, and 
lower occlusal force were significantly associated with a higher OHIP-J summary 
score.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that the difference in masticatory 
performance and occlusal force between ISFPs and RPDs is small, but ISFPs are 
superior to RPDs with regard to OHRQoL in patients with mandibular 
distal-extension edentulism. In addition, there appears to be a slight 
correlation between the OHIP-J and occlusal force in these patients.

Cost-effectiveness of the Norwegian breast cancer screening program.

The Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) has a nation-wide 
coverage since 2005. All women aged 50-69 years are invited biennially for 
mammography screening. We evaluated breast cancer mortality reduction and 
performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, using our microsimulation model, 
calibrated to most recent data. The microsimulation model allows for the 
comparison of mortality and costs between a (hypothetical) situation without 
screening and a situation with screening. Breast cancer incidence in Norway had 
a steep increase in the early 1990s. We calibrated the model to simulate this 
increase and included recent costs for screening, diagnosis and treatment of 
breast cancer and travel and productivity loss. We estimate a 16% breast cancer 
mortality reduction for a cohort of women, invited to screening, followed over 
their complete lifetime. Cost-effectiveness is estimated at NOK 112,162 per QALY 
gained, when taking only direct medical costs into account (the cost of the 
buses, examinations, and invitations). We used a 3.5% annual discount rate. 
Cost-effectiveness estimates are substantially below the threshold of NOK 
1,926,366 as recommended by the WHO guidelines. For the Norwegian population, 
which has been gradually exposed to screening, breast cancer mortality reduction 
for women exposed to screening is increasing and is estimated to rise to ∼30% in 
2020 for women aged 55-80 years. The NBCSP is a highly cost-effective measure to 
reduce breast cancer specific mortality. We estimate a breast cancer specific 
mortality reduction of 16-30%, at the cost of 112,162 NOK per QALY gained.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify predictors and moderators of failure to engage 
(i.e., pretreatment attrition) and dropout in both Internet-based and 
traditional face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa. 
We also sought to determine if Internet-based treatment reduced failure to 
engage and dropout.
METHOD: Participants (N = 191, 98% female) were randomized to Internet-based CBT 
(CBT4BN) or traditional face-to-face group CBT (CBTF2F). Sociodemographics, 
clinical history, eating disorder severity, comorbid psychopathology, health 
status and quality of life, personality and temperament, and treatment-related 
factors were investigated as predictors.
RESULTS: Failure to engage was associated with lower perceived treatment 
credibility and expectancy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97) and body 
mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18). Dropout was predicted by not 
having a college degree (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), novelty 
seeking (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), previous CBT experience (HR = 1.77; 95% 
CI: 1.16, 2.71), and randomization to the individual's nonpreferred treatment 
format (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.96).
DISCUSSION: Those most at risk of failure to engage had a higher BMI and 
perceived treatment as less credible and less likely to succeed. Dropout was 
associated with less education, higher novelty seeking, previous CBT experience, 
and a mismatch between preferred and assigned treatment. Contrary to 
expectations, Internet-based CBT did not reduce failure to engage or dropout. ©

While seasonality has often been investigated with respect to reproduction, 
seasonality of mortality has received less attention. We investigated whether a 
seasonal signal of mortality exists in wild ruminants kept in zoos, using data 
from 60,591 individuals of 88 species. We quantified the mortality in the 3 
consecutive months with the highest above-baseline mortality (3 MM). 3 MM was 
not related to relative life expectancy of species, indicating that seasonal 
mortality does not necessarily impact husbandry success. Although 3 MM was 
mainly observed in autumn/winter months, there was no evidence for an expected 
negative relationship with the latitude of the species' natural habitat and no 
positive relationship between 3 MM and the mean temperature in that habitat, 
indicating no evidence for species from lower latitudes/warmer climates being 
more susceptible to seasonal mortality under zoo conditions. 3 MM was related to 
reproductive biology, with seasonally reproducing species also displaying more 
seasonal mortality. This pattern differed between groups: In cervids, the onset 
of seasonal mortality appeared linked to the onset of rut in both sexes. This 
was less evident in bovids, where in a number of species (especially caprids), 
the onset of female seasonal mortality was linked to the lambing period. While 
showing that the origin of a species from warmer climate zones does not 
constrain husbandry success in ruminants in terms of an increased seasonal 
mortality, the results suggest that husbandry measures aimed at protecting 
females from rutting males are important, especially in cervids. Zoo Biol.

Long-term prognosis varies widely among patients with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)-related liver cirrhosis. Our study aimed to investigate the applicability 
of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI), Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease 
(MELD) scores to the long-term prognosis prediction of HBV-related cirrhosis. 
Patients diagnosed with HBV-associated cirrhosis from the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between January 2010 and December 2015 
were enrolled in this study. The patients were followed up every 3 months. The 
prognostic performance of ALBI in long-term outcome prediction for HBV-related 
cirrhosis was compared with Child-Pugh and MELD scores using time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristic curve (tdROC) and decision curve analysis. A 
total of 806 patients were included in our study with 275 (34.1%) deceased 
during the follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that ALBI 
grade was an independent predictor associated with mortality. The tdROC analysis 
showed that ALBI score (0.787, 0.830 and 0.833) was superior to MELD (0.693, 
P=.003; 0.717, P<.001; 0.744, P<.001) and Child-Pugh score (0.641, P<.001; 
0.649, P<.001; 0.657, P<.001) for predicting 1-year, 2-year and 3-year 
mortality. Additionally, decision curves also got the similar results. In 
addition, patients with lower ALBI score had a longer life expectancy, even 
among patients within the same Child-Pugh class. Thus, ALBI score was effective 
in predicting the long-term prognosis for patients with HBV-related cirrhosis 
and more accurate than Child-Pugh and MELD scores.
