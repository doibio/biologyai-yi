OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative lifetime costs, benefits, and 
cost-effectiveness between the 2 approaches, canal wall-up (CWU) and canal 
wall-down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy, used in the treatment of cholesteatomas.
STUDY DESIGN: Markov state transition model.
SETTING: Tertiary academic health system.
METHODS: A Markov state transition model was used to simulate outcomes across 
the patient lifetime. Outcome and complication probabilities were obtained from 
the existing literature. Costs were calculated from the payer perspective, with 
procedure, hospital, clinic, and physician cost derived from Medicare 
reimbursement. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to represent 
effectiveness and utility. One-way and probability sensitivity analyses (PSAs) 
were conducted.
RESULTS: The base case analysis, assuming a 40-year-old patient, yielded a 
lifetime cost of $14,214 for a patient treated with the CWU approach assuming 
second-look surgery and $22,290 with a CWD approach. CWU and CWD generated a 
benefit of 17.11 and 17.30 QALYs, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for CWU was $43,237 per QALY. The Monte Carlo PSA 
validated the base case scenario. Using a standard $50,000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold, CWD was the more cost-effective approach and was selected 54.8% of 
the time by the simulation.
CONCLUSION: Both CWU and CWD were found to be cost-effective, with CWD being 
cost-effective 54.8% of the time at a WTP threshold of $50,000. The assumptions 
used in the analysis were validated by the results of 1-way and PSA.

INTRODUCTION: Capability-adjusted life years Sweden (CALY-SWE) are a new Swedish 
questionnaire-based measure for quality of life based on the capability 
approach. CALY-SWE are targeted towards use in cost-effectiveness evaluations of 
social welfare consequences. Here, we first motivate the measure both from a 
theoretical and from a Swedish policy-making perspective. Then, we outline the 
core principles of the measure, namely the relation to the capability approach, 
embedded equity considerations inspired by the fair-innings approach, and the 
bases for which capabilities should be considered. The aims were to 1) the most 
vital capabilities for individuals in Sweden, 2) to define a sufficient level of 
each identified capability to lead a flourishing life, and to 3) develop a 
complete questionnaire for the measurement of the identified capabilities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the selection of capabilities, we used a Delphi 
process with Swedish civil society representants. To inform the questionnaire 
development, we conducted a web survey in three versions, with each Swedish 500 
participants, to assess the distribution of capabilities that resulted from the 
Delphi process in the Swedish population. Each version was formulated with 
different strictness so that less strict wordings of a capability level would 
apply to a larger share of participants. All versions also included questions on 
inequality aversion regarding financial, educational, and health capabilities.
RESULTS: The Delphi process resulted in the following six capabilities: 
Financial situation & housing, health, social relations, occupations, security, 
and political & civil rights. We formulated the final phrasing for the 
questionnaire based on normative reasons and the distribution of capabilities in 
the population while taking into account inequality aversion.
CONCLUSION: We developed a capability-based model for cost effectiveness 
economic evaluations of broader social consequences, specific to the Swedish 
context.

BACKGROUND: Interpreting and utilizing the findings of nutritional research can 
be challenging to clinicians, policy makers, and even researchers. To make 
better decisions about diet, innovative methods that integrate best evidence are 
needed. We have developed a decision support model that predicts how dietary 
choices affect life expectancy (LE).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Based on meta-analyses and data from the Global Burden of 
Disease study (2019), we used life table methodology to estimate how LE changes 
with sustained changes in the intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, 
refined grains, nuts, legumes, fish, eggs, milk/dairy, red meat, processed meat, 
and sugar-sweetened beverages. We present estimates (with 95% uncertainty 
intervals [95% UIs]) for an optimized diet and a feasibility approach diet. An 
optimal diet had substantially higher intake than a typical diet of whole 
grains, legumes, fish, fruits, vegetables, and included a handful of nuts, while 
reducing red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and refined grains. 
A feasibility approach diet was a midpoint between an optimal and a typical 
Western diet. A sustained change from a typical Western diet to the optimal diet 
from age 20 years would increase LE by more than a decade for women from the 
United States (10.7 [95% UI 8.4 to 12.3] years) and men (13.0 [95% UI 9.4 to 
14.3] years). The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes (females: 
2.2 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.4]; males: 2.5 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.9]), whole grains (females: 
2.0 [95% UI 1.3 to 2.7]; males: 2.3 [95% UI 1.6 to 3.0]), and nuts (females: 1.7 
[95% UI 1.5 to 2.0]; males: 2.0 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.3]), and less red meat 
(females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]) and processed 
meat (females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]). 
Changing from a typical diet to the optimized diet at age 60 years would 
increase LE by 8.0 (95% UI 6.2 to 9.3) years for women and 8.8 (95% UI 6.8 to 
10.0) years for men, and 80-year-olds would gain 3.4 years (95% UI females: 2.6 
to 3.8/males: 2.7 to 3.9). Change from typical to feasibility approach diet 
would increase LE by 6.2 (95% UI 3.5 to 8.1) years for 20-year-old women from 
the United States and 7.3 (95% UI 4.7 to 9.5) years for men. Using NutriGrade, 
the overall quality of evidence was assessed as moderate. The methodology 
provides population estimates under given assumptions and is not meant as 
individualized forecasting, with study limitations that include uncertainty for 
time to achieve full effects, the effect of eggs, white meat, and oils, 
individual variation in protective and risk factors, uncertainties for future 
development of medical treatments; and changes in lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: A sustained dietary change may give substantial health gains for 
people of all ages both for optimized and feasible changes. Gains are predicted 
to be larger the earlier the dietary changes are initiated in life. The 
Food4HealthyLife calculator that we provide online could be useful for 
clinicians, policy makers, and laypeople to understand the health impact of 
dietary choices.

Despite the tremendous burden of liver cancer and its underlying causes on 
humankind, there appear to be heterogeneities in coping approaches. The 
objective of this study was to compare the burden and the quality-of-care of 
liver cancer by causes among different countries and regions in both sexes and 
various age groups 1990-2019. Data of liver cancer and underlying causes, 
including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol use, 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other causes were obtained from the 
Global Burden of Diseases 2019. Incidence, prevalence, death, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were assessed. Principal component 
analysis was used to combine age-standardized mortality-to-incidence ratio, 
DALY-to-prevalence ratio, prevalence-to-incidence ratio, and years of life 
lost-to-years lived with disability into a single proxy named Quality of Care 
Index (QCI). Globally, the age-standardized incidence, DALYs, and death rates 
decreased from 1990 to 2019, while the QCI scores increased by 68.5%. The QCI 
score of liver cancer was from as high as 83.3 in high Sociodemographic Index 
(SDI) countries to values as low as 26.4 in low SDI countries in 2019. Japan had 
the highest QCI score (QCI = 100). The age-standardized death rates of liver 
cancer due to all underlying causes were decreasing during the past 30 years, 
with the most decrease for HBV. Consistently, the global QCI scores of liver 
cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol use, NASH, and other causes reached 53.5, 61.8, 
54.3, 52.9, and 63.7, respectively, in 2019. Conclusion: Although the trends in 
burden are decreasing and the QCI improved from 1990 to 2019 globally, there is 
a wide gap between countries. Given the inequities in health care quality, there 
is an urgent need to address discrimination and bridge the gap.

BACKGROUND:  Although breast lymphedema (BL) significantly deteriorates quality 
of life (QOL) of breast cancer survivors, little is known and pathophysiological 
severity staging system is yet reported. This study aimed to evaluate usefulness 
of a novel BL severity staging system based on indocyanine green (ICG) 
lymphography findings.
METHODS:  Breast cancer survivors with breast symptoms who underwent breast ICG 
lymphography were included. Breast ICG lymphography stage was determined based 
on visibility of linear pattern and extension of dermal backflow patterns. 
Prevalence of breast symptoms and lymphedema QOL score (LeQOLiS) was compared 
according to the stage.
RESULTS:  Thirty-seven patients were included. Breast ICG lymphography stage 
included stage 0 in 11 (29.7%) cases, stage I in 3 (8.1%) cases, stage II in 11 
(29.7%) cases, stage III in 6 (16.2%) cases, stage IV in 4 (10.8%) cases, and 
stage V in 2 (5.4%) cases. Higher ICG stages were associated with more frequent 
prevalence of breast swelling (p = 0.020), breast pain (p = 0.238), and breast 
cellulitis (p = 0.024), and with higher LeQOLiS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION:  ICG lymphography allows clear visualization of superficial lymph 
circulation in the breast. Higher breast ICG lymphography stages are associated 
with more frequent prevalence of BL-related symptoms and worse QOL.

An index that evaluates the health level of a population group considering both 
death and loss of function due to disease is called a summary measure of 
population health (SMPH). SMPHs are broadly divided into life year indices and 
life expectancy indices, the latter of which comprise healthy life expectancy 
(HLE). HLE is included as a policy target in various national and regional level 
healthcare plans, and the term "HLE" is commonly used in academia and by the 
public. However, the overall level of understanding of HLE-such as the precise 
definition of HLE and methods of calculating HLE-still seems to be low. As 
discussed in this study, the types of HLE are classified into disability-free 
life expectancy, disease-free life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
self-rated HLE, and disability-adjusted life expectancy. Their characteristics 
are examined to facilitate a correct understanding and appropriate utilization 
of HLE. In addition, the Sullivan method, as a representative method for 
calculating HLE, is presented in detail, and major issues in the process of 
calculating HLE, such as selection of the population group and age group, 
estimation of death probability, calculation of life years, and incorporation of 
health weights, are reviewed. This study will help researchers to select an 
appropriate HLE type and evaluate the validity of HLE research results, and it 
is expected to contribute to the vitalization of HLE research.

Disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) estimates may vary according to factors 
such as the standard life expectancy, age weighting, time preference and 
discount rate, calculation of disability weights, and selection of the 
estimation method. DALY estimation methods are divided into the following 3 
approaches: the incidence-based approach, the pure prevalence-based approach, 
and the hybrid approach. These 3 DALY estimation approaches each reflect 
different perspectives on the burden of disease using unique characteristics, 
based on which the selection of a suitable approach may vary by the purpose of 
the study. The Global Burden of Disease studies, which previously estimated 
DALYs using the incidence-based approach, switched to using the hybrid approach 
in 2010, while the National Burden of Disease studies in Korea still mainly 
apply the incidence-based approach. In order to increase comparability with 
other international burden of disease studies, more DALY studies using the 
prevalence-based approach need to be conducted in Korea. However, with the 
limitations of the hybrid approach in mind, it is necessary to conduct more 
research using a disease classification system suitable for Korea. Furthermore, 
more detailed and valid data sources should be established before conducting 
studies using a broader variety of DALY estimation approaches. This review study 
will help researchers on burden of disease use an appropriate DALY estimation 
approach and will contribute to enhancing researchers' ability to critically 
interpret burden of disease studies.

INTRODUCTION: For clinical decision-making, an estimate of remaining lifetime is 
needed to assess benefit against harm of a treatment during the remaining 
lifespan. Here, we describe how to predict life expectancy based on age, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a Drug Comorbidity Index (DCI), whilst also 
considering potential future changes in CCI and DCI using population-based data 
on Swedish men.
METHODS: Simulations based on annual updates of vital status, CCI and DCI were 
used to estimate life expectancy at population level. The probabilities of these 
transitions were determined from generalised linear models using prostate 
cancer-free comparison men in PCBaSe Sweden. A simulation was performed for each 
combination of age, CCI, and DCI. Survival curves were created and compared to 
observed survival. Life expectancy was then calculated as the area under the 
simulated survival curve.
RESULTS: There was good agreement between observed and simulated survival curves 
for most ages and comorbidities, except for younger men. With increasing age and 
comorbidity, there was a decrease in life expectancy. Cross-validation based on 
six regions in Sweden also showed that simulated and observed survival was 
similar.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed method provides an alternative statistical approach to 
estimate life expectancy at population level based on age and comorbidity 
assessed by routinely collected information on diagnoses and filled 
prescriptions available in nationwide health care registers.

With population ageing, the number of older people is growing, which results in 
increasing number of people with multimorbidity and related polypharmacy. 
Polypharmacy in its turn leads to drug-related problems (DRPs) and potentially 
inappropriate prescribing (IP) in older people. In this commentary, 
susceptibility of older people to DRPs due to changes in pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics, plurality of prescribing physicians, inadequate consideration 
of patients' characteristics, polypharmacy and its consequences such as 
prescribing cascades, drug interactions and potentially IP have been discussed 
respectively. Consecutively, identifying DRPs and optimizing of IP, including 
drug reconciliation, application of criteria for identifying and preventing IP, 
implementation of computer-based prescribing systems, and comprehensive 
geriatric assessment and management have been elaborated as well. One of the 
main challenges regarding appropriate and tailored prescribing in older people 
is to evaluate whether the expected benefits of pharmacotherapy are bigger than 
the risks in a population with multimorbidity, decreased tolerance to 
vulnerability and limited life expectancy. Comprehensive geriatric assessment 
enables informed prescribing decisions in the context of such variables. A 
challenge for future research is how to integrate important clinical information 
obtained by existing methods into a comprehensive and wide-reaching approach 
targeting all potential factors involved in causing DRPs. Good prescribing in 
late life accommodates the needs of older patients with multimorbidity. 
Individualized, interactive, multidisciplinary, and multifaceted approach to 
geriatric pharmacotherapy should be promoted and encouraged. How to optimize 
pharmacological prescription in complex older patients is a major legacy of 
geriatrics to contemporary medicine/medical practice.

Seasonal temperatures select for eclosion timing of temperate insects and their 
parasitoids. In western North America, the fruit fly Rhagoletis zephyria Snow 
(Diptera: Tephritidae) is parasitized by the hymenopterous wasps Utetes 
lectoides (Gahan), an egg parasite, and Opius downesi Gahan, a larval parasite 
(both Braconidae). Eclosion of wasps should be timed with the presence of 
susceptible fly stages, but reports indicate U. lectoides ecloses in the absence 
of flies under no-chill conditions. Based on this, we tested the hypotheses that 
chill durations and no-chill temperatures both differentially regulate eclosion 
times of R. zephyria and its parasitic wasps. When fly puparia were chilled at 
~3°C for 130-180 d, U. lectoides and O. downesi always eclosed on average later 
than flies. However, after 180-d chill, flies eclosed on average earlier than 
after 130- and 150-d chill, whereas eclosion times of U. lectoides and O. 
downesi were less or not affected by chill duration. When fly puparia were 
exposed to 20-22°C (no chill), U. lectoides eclosed before flies, with 88.9% of 
U. lectoides versus only 0.61% of flies eclosing. Taken together, findings show 
that eclosion times of flies are more sensitive to changes in chill duration 
than those of wasps. Flies are less sensitive than wasps to no-chill in that 
most flies do not respond by eclosing after no-chill while most wasps do. Our 
results suggest that shorter winters and longer summers due to climate change 
could cause mismatches in eclosion times of flies and wasps, with potentially 
significant evolutionary consequences.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is a major public health concern. Complex 
interventions, incorporating individualized care plans, may be appropriate for 
patients with multimorbidity given their individualized and variable needs. 
There is a dearth of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of complex 
multimorbidity interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the cost-effectiveness of a 6-week occupational 
therapy-led self-management support programme (OPTIMAL) for adults with 
multimorbidity.
METHODS: Economic evaluation, from a healthcare perspective, was conducted 
alongside a randomized controlled trial of 149 adults with multimorbidity. 
Intervention was the OPTIMAL programme with a comparison of usual primary care. 
Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and expected 
cost-effectiveness were estimated at 6 months and uncertainty was explored using 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a mean improvement in QALYs gained 
of 0.031 per patient (P-value: 0.063; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: -0.002 to 
0.063) and a mean reduction in total costs of €2,548 (P-value: 0.114; 95% CIs: 
-5,606 to 509) per patient. At cost-effectiveness threshold values of €20,000 
and €45,000 per QALY, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective 
was estimated to be 0.951 and 0.958, respectively. The results remained 
consistent across all subgroups examined.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the limited evidence base on the 
cost-effectiveness of complex interventions for multimorbidity, and highlights 
the potential for the OPTIMAL programme to be cost-effective. Further studies 
are warranted to explore the clinical and cost-effectiveness of complex 
interventions for the multimorbidity patient population, and for subgroups 
within it.

PURPOSE: Quadriceps tendon ruptures (QTR) occur predominantly in middle-aged 
patients through violent eccentric contraction that occurs either when trying to 
regain balance or during a fall on the hyperflexed knee. The aim of this study 
was to quantify midterm postoperative results, including strength potential 
measured via standardized strength tests following acute (< six weeks) 
quadriceps tendon refixation using suture anchors.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with QTR who underwent surgical suture anchor 
refixation between 2012 and 2019 at a single institution with a minimum 
follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively evaluated. Outcome measures included 
Tegner Activity Scale (TAS), Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation 
Committee subjective knee form (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS) subscales, return to work rates, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for 
pain. Additionally, a standardized clinical examination and an isometric 
strength assessment of knee extension and flexion were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (median age 61.0 [25-75% IQR 50.5-72.5]) were 
available for final assessment at a mean follow-up of 47.1 ± SD 25.4 months. The 
majority of patients were male (82.4%) and most injuries occurred due to a fall 
on the hyperflexed knee (76.5%). The average time interval between trauma and 
surgery was 12.7 ± 7.5 days. Patients achieved a moderate level of activity 
postoperatively with a median TAS of 4 (3-5.5) and reported good to excellent 
outcome scores (Lysholm score: 97 (86.5-100); IKDC: 80.7 ± 13.5; KOOS subscales: 
pain 97.2 (93.1-100), symptoms 92.9 (82.5-100), activities of daily living 97.1 
(93.4-100), sport and recreation function 80 (40-97.5) and knee-related quality 
of life 87.5 (62.5-100). All patients were able to fully return to work and 
reported little pain [VAS: 0 (0-0)]. No postoperative complications were 
reported. Strength measurements revealed a significant deficit of knee extension 
strength in comparison to the contralateral side (p = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: Suture anchor refixation of acute QTR leads to good functional 
results and high patient satisfaction without major complications. Isometric 
knee extension strength, however, may not be fully restored compared to the 
unaffected side.

PURPOSE: The correlation of CSE1L (human chromosomal segregation 1-like) 
staining intensity with disease-free survival, disease recurrence and 
development of distant metastases in Advanced Laryngeal Tumors.
METHODS: Specimens of patients with advanced glottic larynx cancer (T3, T4) were 
evaluated for nuclear CSE1L staining intensity. According to mild, moderate and 
severe CSE1L staining, patients were compared in terms of disease-free survival, 
disease recurrence and development of distant metastases.
RESULTS: 17 of the 57 patients died within 5 years, distant metastases developed 
in 5 patients, and recurrence in 5 patients. Of the 17 patients who died within 
5 years, 10(%59) showed severe staining with CSE1L, 6 (%35) showed moderate 
staining, and only 1 (%6) patient showed mild staining. 4 (%80) out of 5 
patients who developed distant metastases were those with moderate staining with 
CSE1L. Metastases did not develop in any patient who stained poorly with CSE1L. 
2 (%40) of the 5 patients who developed relapse were patients with severe 
staining with CSE1L, while 3 (%60) were patients with moderate staining with 
CSE1L. No recurrence was observed in any patient with mild staining with CSE1L.
CONCLUSION: CSE1L will help in demonstrating the increased risk of distant 
metastasis, increased recurrence probability and shortened life expectancy of 
advanced laryngeal carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: In the USA, chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 1 in 7 adults and 
costs $100 billion annually. The DAPA-CKD trial found dapagliflozin, a sodium 
glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, to be effective in reducing CKD 
progression and mortality in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. 
Currently, SGLT2 inhibitors are not considered standard of care for patients 
with non-diabetic CKD.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to standard 
management of patients with non-diabetic CKD.
DESIGN: Markov model with lifetime time horizon and US healthcare sector 
perspective.
PATIENTS: Patients with non-diabetic CKD INTERVENTION: Dapagliflozin plus 
standard care versus standard care only.
MAIN MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), all discounted at 3% annually; total 
incidence of kidney failure on kidney replacement therapy; average years on 
kidney replacement therapy.
KEY RESULTS: Adding dapagliflozin to standard care improved life expectancy by 2 
years, increased discounted QALYS (from 6.75 to 8.06), and reduced the total 
incidence of kidney failure on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) (from 17.4 to 
11.0%) and average years on KRT (from 0.77 to 0.43) over the lifetime of the 
cohort. Dapagliflozin plus standard care was more effective than standard care 
alone while increasing lifetime costs (from $245,900 to $324,8900, or $60,000 
per QALY gained). Results were robust to variations in assumptions about 
dapagliflozin's efficacy over time and by CKD stage, added costs of kidney 
replacement therapy, and expected population annual CKD progression rates and 
sensitive to the cost of dapagliflozin. The net 1-year budgetary implication of 
treating all US patients with non-diabetic CKD could be up to $21 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin improved life expectancy and reduced progression of 
CKD, the proportion of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy, and time 
on kidney replacement therapy in patients with non-diabetic CKD. Use of 
dapagliflozin meets conventional criteria for cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the contributions of epidemiological changes (age- and 
gender-specific suicide rates) and demographic forces (population growth and 
aging) to global changes in years of life lost (YLLs) from suicide over the last 
30 years.
METHOD: A decomposition analysis was used to assess the impacts of population 
growth, population aging, and suicide prevalence on global changes in YLLs from 
suicide between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, global YLLs from suicide reduced by 2,073,714 years 
(5.9%), from 35,246,316 years to 33,172,602 years. This was mainly due to the 
decline in age-specific suicide rates, which reduced the overall YLLs from 
suicide by 20,185,691 years (973.4%). However, this decline was offset by the 
impacts of population growth and population aging, which increased global YLLs 
from suicide by 14,949,110 years (-720.9%) and 3,442,074 years (-166.0%), 
respectively. The combined effects of epidemiological and demographic drivers 
were also reflected in different trends in YLLs from suicide across genders and 
World Bank income level regions, with particularly notable increases in low- 
income and lower-middle income countries and the aging population.
CONCLUSIONS: With the significant effects of epidemiological and demographic 
drivers, global and regional YLLs from suicide may be expected to change greatly 
in the future. Efforts to reduce the burden of suicide require appropriate 
allocation of resources for suicide-prevention strategies and further 
consideration of demographic factors.

Social connection is important across the life course, but overall levels have 
been declining. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique context to examine 
social connectedness and adaptive capacity in times of social adversity. We used 
a parallel mixed method design to collect online survey data from a 
representative U.S. sample (N  =  359). Applying an exploratory sequential 
approach, we used a general linear model multivariate approach to repeated 
measures to test for differences in participants' perceptions of social 
connectedness by time and age category and qualitative analysis to gain insights 
about disrupted social contexts. Results indicated that social connectedness 
decreased after mitigation restrictions for all age groups, but individuals in 
emerging and late adulthood felt the greatest impact. Two themes emerged: 
differing emotional responses to altered communication and intentionality of 
maintaining and/or creating social connections. Experiences of social 
connectedness need to be understood as a function of life stage and 
developmental timing.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is condition which poses a main concern to the aging 
population and its severity is expected to increase with the increasing life 
expectancy. In the future, several possible targets for OA treatment need to be 
defined. Dickkopf‑related protein 3 (DKK3) is an atypical member of the 
Wnt‑antagonistic dickkopf‑related protein (DKK) family. The availability of 
research into the role of DKK3 in the abnormal remodeling of subchondral bone in 
human knee joints is currently limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was 
the evaluation of DKK3 expression in the abnormal bone remodeling of subchondral 
bone in human knee OA in order to clarify the role of DKK3 in subchondral bone 
remodeling and to acknowledge its potential relevance to β‑catenin. In total, 38 
specimens were collected from osteotomies of the medial tibial plateau of the 
human knee. The patient samples were then divided into the normal, mild, 
moderate and severe symptom groups, according to the Osteoarthritis Research 
Society International (OARSI) score. Following hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and 
Safranin O‑fast green staining for alkaline phosphatase (AZO method), changes in 
the distribution and number of osteocytes in the subchondral bone and the degree 
of sclerosis of the subchondral bone were observed. Immunohistochemical 
staining, immunofluorescence, western blot analysis and reverse‑transcription 
quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) were used for the detection of DKK3 and β‑catenin 
expression level changes in osteoblasts in the subchondral bone of the medial 
tibial plateau. H&E and alkaline phosphatase staining revealed that the total 
number of osteocytes in the subchondral bone increased with the severity of the 
disease. The samples were also evaluated using Safranin O‑Fast Green staining 
and were attributed a score according to the OARSI scoring system: The scoring 
number and cartilage damage increased along with OA severity. 
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that β‑catenin 
expression in osteocytes increased from mild to moderate, whereas DKK3 
expression decreased with the development of arthritis from normal, mild to 
moderate. According to the results of western blot analysis, β‑catenin 
expression was higher in moderate OA and then decreased in severe OA. On the 
other hand, the DKK3 levels decreased along with the progression from normal, 
mild to moderate OA. The results of RT‑qPCR demonstrated that β‑catenin and DKK3 
gene expression differed with the degree of OA. On the whole, the present study 
demonstrates that DKK3 and β‑catenin may play opposite roles in OA subchondral 
bone remodeling.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension treatment in older adults can decrease mortality, 
cardiovascular events, including heart failure, cognitive impairment, and stroke 
risk, but may also lead to harms such as syncope and falls. Guidelines recommend 
targeting preventive interventions with immediate harms and delayed benefits to 
patients whose life expectancy exceeds the intervention's time to benefit (TTB). 
Our objective was to estimate a meta-analyzed TTB for stroke prevention after 
initiation of more intensive hypertension treatment in adults aged ≥65 years.
METHODS: Studies were identified from two Cochrane systematic reviews and a 
search of MEDLINE and Google Scholar for subsequent publications until August 
31, 2021. We abstracted data from randomized controlled trials comparing 
standard (untreated, placebo, or less intensive treatment) to more intensive 
treatment groups in older adults (mean age ≥ 65 years). We fit Weibull survival 
curves and used a random-effects model to estimate the pooled annual absolute 
risk reduction (ARR) between control and intervention groups. We applied Markov 
chain Monte Carlo methods to determine the time to ARR thresholds (0.002, 0.005, 
and 0.01) for a first stroke.
RESULTS: Nine trials (n = 38,779) were identified. The mean age ranged from 66 
to 84 years and study follow-up times ranged from 2.0 to 5.8 years. We 
determined that 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0-2.9) years were required to prevent 1 stroke for 
200 persons (ARR = 0.005) receiving more intensive hypertensive treatment. 
Heterogeneity was found across studies, with those focusing on tighter systolic 
blood pressure control (SBP < 150 mmHg) showing longer TTB. For example, in the 
SPRINT study (baseline SBP = 140 mmHg, achieved SBP = 121 mmHg), the TTB to 
avoid 1 stroke for 200 patients treated was 5.9 years (95%CI: 2.2-13.0).
CONCLUSIONS: More intensive hypertension treatment in 200 older adults prevents 
1 stroke after 1.7 years. Given the heterogeneity across studies, the TTB 
estimates from individual studies may be more relevant for clinical 
decision-making than our summary estimate.

PURPOSE: The best treatment of humeral shaft fractures in adults is still under 
debate. This study aimed to compare functional and clinical outcome of operative 
versus nonoperative treatment in adult patients with a humeral shaft fracture. 
We hypothesized that operative treatment would result in earlier functional 
recovery.
METHODS: From October 23, 2012 to October 03, 2018, adults with a humeral shaft 
fracture AO type 12A or 12B were enrolled in a prospective cohort study in 29 
hospitals. Patients were treated operatively or nonoperatively. Outcome measures 
were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (DASH; primary 
outcome), Constant-Murley score, pain (Visual Analog Score, VAS), health-related 
quality of life (Short Form-36 (SF-36) and EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ-5D)), activity 
resumption (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS), range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder 
and elbow joint, radiologic healing, and complications. Patients were followed 
for one year. Repeated measure analysis was done with correction for age, 
gender, and fracture type.
RESULTS: Of the 390 included patients, 245 underwent osteosynthesis and 145 were 
primarily treated nonoperatively. Patients in the operative group were younger 
(median 53 versus 62 years; p < 0.001) and less frequently female (54.3% versus 
64.8%; p = 0.044). Superior results in favor of the operative group were noted 
until six months follow-up for the DASH, Constant-Murley, abduction,
