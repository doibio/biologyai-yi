ischemic stroke. However, thus far, it remains uncertain whether MT is effective 
in elderly patients aged over 80 years.
METHODS: Between July 2013 and June 2016, 207 patients with acute ischemic 
stroke in the anterior circulation received MT at our center. The applied MT 
strategies were forced arterial suction thrombectomy (FAST) and stent retriever 
thrombectomy. Patients were divided into those <80 years (n = 173) and those 
≥80 years (n = 34). We compared clinical and angiographic parameters between 
groups.
RESULTS: The median age was 67.5 in the younger group and 82 in the elderly 
group; 92.5% of the younger group and 70.6% of the elderly group received MT via 
the FAST technique. Angiographic outcomes, including procedural time, mTICI 2b-3 
reperfusion (85.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.633), and symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, were not different between the groups. A favorable clinical outcome 
rate was significantly higher in the younger group (62.4% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.047). 
Younger age, a low NIHSS score, and fast onset to reperfusion time were 
favorable prognostic factors in elderly patients.
CONCLUSION: Modern MT in elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke is safe and 
effective compared to younger patients despite a lower favorable clinical 
outcome. Our findings may suggest that an appropriate MT strategy with respect 
to the location of the target occlusion and vascular tortuosity might be helpful 
to achieve fast reperfusion and improved outcomes for elderly patients.

This descriptive-analytical study used data envelopment analysis to evaluated 
the technical efficiency (TE) of health systems in Member States of the World 
Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region during 2004-2011. Life 
expectancy and infant mortality were used as outputs. Per capita total 
expenditure on health, and number of physicians, nurses and midwives and 
hospital beds per 1000 people were used as inputs. The determinants of TE of the 
health systems were examined using a regression model. United Arab Emirates and 
Somalia had the most efficient health systems with a TE score of 1. Djibouti and 
Libya had the most inefficient health systems, with TE scores of 0.346 and 
0.435, respectively. The most important determinants of TE were the level of 
education and gross domestic product per capita. The relationship between 
unemployment and out-of-pocket health expenditure was not significantly 
associated with TE of the health systems. To improve TE of the health systems, 
countries should focus on individuals' empowerment in education and income 
level, rather than only on providing healthcare services.

PURPOSE: The effects of inflammation on the prognosis, life expectancy and 
several parameters such as response to treatment of breast cancer have been 
previously studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 
inflammatory markers on prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 81 patients with metastatic breast cancer 
who have been followed up at the Department of Medical Oncology, Hacettepe 
University Institute of Oncology, between December, 2009 and March, 2014. For 
all studied parameters Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and p values computed by 
log-rank test were calculated. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 26 months. There were 38 deaths due to 
disease progression during the follow up. The levels of serum albumin, and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were not associated with a significant 
effect on overall survival (OS). Among patients with a higher serum C-reactive 
protein (CRP), the estimated mean survival was 84±36 months, compared to 278±113 
months among patients with a normal serum CRP (p=0.032). When patients with 
higher and normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were compared, their 2-year 
OS survival rates were 68.2 and 87.7%, respectively (p=0.034). Among patients 
with higher serum ferritin levels, the estimated mean survival was 29±10 months, 
compared to 212±113 months for normal serum ferritin (p=0.01). Among patients 
with higher serum beta-2 microglobulin (β2-M), the estimated mean OS survival 
was 28±8 months, compared to 84±57 months for those with normal levels (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Serum CRP, ferritin and β2-M can be useful prognostic factors for OS 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Potent antiretroviral treatment has resulted in near normal life 
expectancy for people living with HIV. Consequently, there is an increased focus 
on comorbidities, frailty and quality of life.
METHODS: We assessed and compared the prevalence of frailty, associated factors 
and relationship with quality of life in older Australian men living with HIV in 
a cross-sectional study using three frailty measurements. The Frailty Phenotype, 
Frailty Index and Edmonton Frail Scale were applied to 93 HIV-infected men aged 
over 50 years, on antiretroviral therapy. Multivariable ordinal logistic 
regression was used to analyse the associations of frailty with covariates and 
quality of life.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty was 10.8% (n=10) using the Frailty Phenotype; 
22.6% (n=21) using the Frailty Index and 15.1% (n=14) using the Edmonton Frail 
Scale. Frailty Phenotype-defined pre-frailty/frailty was associated with 
pre-1996 ART initiation (OR, 3.56; CI, 1.23, 10.36; P=0.020) and depression (OR, 
3.74; CI, 1.24, 11.27; P=0.019). Osteoporosis, serious non-AIDS events and AIDS 
were associated with Frailty Index-defined frailty (OR, 4.84, CI, 1.27, 18.43, 
P=0.021; OR, 4.27, CI, 1.25, 14.58, P=0.020; OR, 4.62, CI, 1.30, 16.45, P=0.018, 
respectively) and Edmonton Frail Scale-defined frailty (OR, 7.51; CI, 1.55, 
36.42; P=0.012; OR, 7.71; CI, 1.62, 36.75; P=0.010; OR, 8.53; CI, 1.70, 42.73; 
P=0.009, respectively), independent of age and current CD4+ T-cell count. 
Frailty, defined by any of the instruments, was significantly associated with 
poorer quality of life (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying frailty is an increasingly important contemporary 
consideration of HIV care related to ageing and quality of life.

Improved PKS Gene Expression With Strong Endogenous Promoter Resulted in 
Geldanamycin Yield Increase.

Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

The type I polyketide geldanamycin is a potent anti-tumor reagent. Its 
biosynthesis includes three steps: the biosynthesis of precursors, such as 
3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), the polyketide synthase (PKS) chain 
extension, and the post-PKS modifications. According to the genomic and 
transcriptomic analysis, the PKS chain extension was deduced to be the 
rate-limiting step for geldanamycin production in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 
XM201. In order to improve the expression of PKS genes, a strong endogenous 
promoter 5063p was obtained based on the transcriptomic analysis and XylE 
enzymatic assay. By replacing the native PKS promoter gdmA1p with 5063p, the 
expression of the PKS genes during geldanamycin fermentation was increased by 
4-141-folds, and the geldanamycin yield was increased by 39%. Interestingly, 
AHBA feeding experiment showed that the supply of AHBA in turn become a new 
rate-limiting factor for geldanamycin production. Further combined 
overexpression of the 6-gene AHBA biosynthetic cassette and PKS genes increased 
the yield of geldanamycin by 88%, from 773 mg L-1 of the wild-type to 
1450 mg L-1 in the derived strain. Our results suggested that improved 
expression of all PKS genes in a particular biosynthetic gene cluster is 
important for the yield increase of the corresponding polyketide natural 
product.

The Changing Paradigm of Radiotherapy in the Elderly Population.

There is increasing awareness of the special needs for care of the elderly 
cancer patient. Newer precise conformal radiotherapy techniques allow the safe 
delivery of higher doses of radiotherapy to the target tumor while reducing the 
dose to surrounding critical organs. This has led to a shortening of 
radiotherapy protocols for both curative and palliative indications. We review 
these novel techniques and protocols and the published clinical studies that 
include elderly patients treated with these techniques. Despite the fact that 
the elderly are a growing significant proportion of cancer patients, and the 
need for radiotherapy in the elderly is expected to rise with increasing life 
expectancy, they are underrepresented in most clinical studies of radiotherapy, 
and there are few studies specifically investigating radiotherapy in the 
elderly. The treatment of early-stage primary lung cancer with stereotactic body 
radiotherapy is a prime example how new highly conformal techniques and 
shortened treatment protocols are changing the approach to radiotherapy in the 
elderly. With improved imaging and radiotherapy treatment precision, it is 
expected that such techniques will become increasingly used in other cancer 
sites. It is important for radiation oncologists to be aware of the special 
needs of the elderly cancer patient and in particular to assess these patients 
based on functional status and not only chronological age. In addition, 
geriatric oncologists should be aware of modern radiotherapy techniques that can 
be particularly appropriate for the elderly patient.

Early Stage Cancer in Older Adults: Prostate-Avoiding Overtreatment and 
Undertreatment.

Narayan V(1), Jiang S, Warlick CA.

Author information:

The diagnosis of prostate cancer in elderly men is likely to increase over the 
next several decades, owing to changing demographics and a rising population of 
men older than 65 years. Given the heterogeneity and well-documented challenges 
in screening, diagnosing, and managing indolent versus aggressive prostate 
cancer, the geriatric patient population is particularly vulnerable to prostate 
cancer treatment nuances. Clinicians must become familiar with geriatric 
assessment tools to better answer life-expectancy questions prior to counseling 
patients on treatment options. The preferences and values of patients and their 
families must always be considered when making screening and treatment 
decisions. Careful selection of patients following a holistic evaluation will 
not only minimize overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer, but may 
also allow for the early identification of unique geriatric vulnerabilities and 
permit quicker interventions to improve the quality of life of these men during 
their elderly years.

Cancer Screening in the Elderly: A Review of Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and 
Prostate Cancer Screening.

Author information:

†Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.

There are relatively limited data on outcomes of screening older adults for 
cancer; therefore, the decision to screen older adults requires balancing the 
potential harms of screening and follow-up diagnostic tests with the possibility 
of benefit. Harms of screening can be amplified in older and frail adults and 
include discomfort from undergoing the test itself, anxiety, potential 
complications from diagnostic procedures resulting from a false-positive test, 
false reassurance from a false-negative test, and overdiagnosis of tumors that 
are of no threat and may result in overtreatment. In this paper, we review the 
evidence and guidelines on breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer as 
applied to older adults. We also provide a general framework for approaching 
cancer screening in older adults by incorporating evidence-based guidelines, 
patient preferences, and patient life expectancy estimates into shared screening 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) provide a summary measure of 
health and can be a critical input to guide health systems, investments, and 
priority-setting in Ethiopia. We aimed to determine the leading causes of 
premature mortality and disability using DALYs and describe the relative burden 
of disease and injuries in Ethiopia.
METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for non-fatal disease burden, cause-specific 
mortality, and all-cause mortality to derive age-standardized DALYs by sex for 
Ethiopia for each year. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) for each age 
group and sex. Causes of death by age, sex, and year were measured mainly using 
Causes of Death Ensemble modeling. To estimate YLDs, a Bayesian meta-regression 
method was used. We reported DALY rates per 100,000 for communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disorders, non-communicable diseases, and 
injuries, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for Ethiopia.
RESULTS: Non-communicable diseases caused 23,118.1 (95% UI, 17,124.4-30,579.6), 
CMNN disorders resulted in 20,200.7 (95% UI, 16,532.2-24,917.9), and injuries 
caused 3781 (95% UI, 2642.9-5500.6) age-standardized DALYs per 100,000 in 
Ethiopia in 2015. Lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and 
tuberculosis were the top three leading causes of DALYs in 2015, accounting for 
2998 (95% UI, 2173.7-4029), 2592.5 (95% UI, 1850.7-3495.1), and 2562.9 (95% UI, 
1466.1-4220.7) DALYs per 100,000, respectively. Ischemic heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease were the fourth and fifth leading causes of 
age-standardized DALYs, with rates of 2535.7 (95% UI, 1603.7-3843.2) and 2159.9 
(95% UI, 1369.7-3216.3) per 100,000, respectively. The following causes showed a 
reduction of 60% or more over the last 25 years: lower respiratory infections, 
diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, neonatal encephalopathy, preterm birth 
complications, meningitis, malaria, protein-energy malnutrition, iron-deficiency 
anemia, measles, war and legal intervention, and maternal hemorrhage.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethiopia has been successful in reducing age-standardized DALYs 
related to most communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional deficiency 
diseases in the last 25 years, causing a major ranking shift to types of 
non-communicable disease. Lower respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, and 
tuberculosis continue to be leading causes of premature death, despite major 
declines in burden. Non-communicable diseases also showed reductions as 
premature mortality declined; however, disability outcomes for these causes did 
not show declines. Recently developed non-communicable disease strategies may 
need to be amended to focus on cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and 
major depressive disorders. Increasing trends of disabilities due to neonatal 
encephalopathy, preterm birth complications, and neonatal disorders should be 
emphasized in the national newborn survival strategy. Generating quality data 
should be a priority through the development of new initiatives such as vital 
events registration, surveillance programs, and surveys to address gaps in data. 
Measuring disease burden at subnational regional state levels and identifying 
variations with urban and rural population health should be conducted to support 
health policy in Ethiopia.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the costs and cost-utility of examination for posterior 
vitreous detachment (PVD) and treatment of associated pathology, and of managing 
various other peripheral retinal disorders to prevent retinal detachment (RD).
DESIGN: A decision analysis model of cost-utility.
PARTICIPANTS: There were no participants.
METHODS: Published retrospective data on the natural course of PVD, retinal 
tears, and lattice degeneration were used to quantitate the visual benefits of 
examination and treatment. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services data were 
used to calculate associated modeled costs in a hospital/facility-based and 
nonfacility/ambulatory surgical center (ASC)-based setting. Published standards 
of utility for a given level of visual acuity were used to derive costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost of evaluation and treatment, utility of defined 
health states, QALY, and cost per QALY.
RESULTS: The modeled cost of evaluation of a patient with PVD and treatment of 
associated pathology in the facility/hospital (nonfacility/ASC)-based setting 
was $65 to $190 ($25-$71) depending on whether a single or 2-examination 
protocol was used. The cost per QALY saved was $255 to $638/QALY 
($100-$239/QALY). Treatment of a symptomatic horseshoe tear resulted in a net 
cost savings of $1749 ($1314) and improved utility, whereas treatment of an 
asymptomatic horseshoe tear resulted in $2981/QALY ($1436/QALY). Treatment of 
asymptomatic lattice degeneration in an eye in which the fellow eye had a 
history of RD resulted in $4414/QALY ($2187/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation and management of incident acute PVD (and symptomatic 
horseshoe tears) offer a low cost and a favorable cost-utility (low $/QALY) as a 
result of the minimization of the cost and morbidity associated with the 
development of RD, thus justifying current practice standards.

This review surveyed the results and methods of cost-utility analyses of 
cataract surgery. Thirteen studies were included. Based on decision-theoretic 
time trade-off, utilities ranged from 0.148 to 0.8 and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) ranged from 1.424 to 2.43. Based on psychometric instruments such 
as Euroqol 5 dimensions, utilities ranged from 0.017 to 0.056 and QALY ranged 
from 0.141 to 0.547. Reported costs per QALY were between $1307 and $14 302. 
Although the review found consistent favorable cost QALY ratios for cataract 
surgery according to the British National Institute for Care and Health 
Excellence threshold, the findings raise doubts about the general applicability 
of existing studies as a tool for allocation decision. The observed large 
heterogeneity of the approaches and outcomes for all parameters reflected the 
complexity of the various evaluation methods and medical care processes and, in 
some cases, inadequate data.

When considering a new vaccine programme or modifying an existing one, economic 
cost-benefit analysis, underpinned by predictive epidemiological modelling, is a 
key component. This analysis is intimately linked to the willingness to pay for 
additional QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) gained; currently in England and 
Wales a health programme is economically viable if the cost per QALY gained is 
less than £ 20,000, and models are often used to assess if a vaccine programme 
is likely to fall below this threshold cost. Before a programme begins, 
infection levels are generally high and therefore vaccination may be expected to 
have substantial effects and therefore will often be economically viable. 
However, once a programme is established, and infection rates are lower, it 
might be expected that a re-evaluation of the programme (using current incidence 
information) will show it to be less cost-effective. This is the scenario we 
examine here with analytical tools and simple ODE models. Surprisingly we show 
that in most cases the benefits from maintaining an existing vaccination 
programme are at least equal to those of starting the programme initially, and 
in the majority of scenarios the differences between the two are minimal. In 
practical terms, this is an extremely helpful finding, allowing us to assert 
that the action of immunising individuals does not de-value the vaccination 
programme.

Riociguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that has been approved for 
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and inoperable chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or persistent/recurrent pulmonary 
hypertension following pulmonary endarterectomy. Riociguat is administered using 
an 8-week individual dose-adjustment scheme whereby a patient initially receives 
riociguat 1.0 mg three times daily (tid), and the dose is then increased every 2 
weeks in the absence of hypotension, indicated by systolic blood pressure 
measurements and symptoms, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg tid. The established 
riociguat dose-adjustment scheme allows the dose of riociguat to be individually 
optimized in terms of tolerability and efficacy. The majority of patients in the 
phase III clinical trials and their long-term extension phases achieved the 
maximum riociguat dose, whereas some patients remained on lower doses. There is 
evidence that these patients may experience benefits at riociguat doses lower 
than 2.5 mg tid, with improvement in exercise capacity being observed after only 
2-4 weeks of treatment in the phase III studies and in the exploratory 
1.5 mg-maximum patient group of PATENT-1. This review aims to provide an 
overview of the rationale behind the riociguat dose-adjustment scheme and 
examine its application to both clinical trials and real-life clinical practice.

Drug treatment is often an essential part in treatment and prevention of 
diseases in older people, but there is much concern about inappropriate 
medication use. This paper aims to describe the complexity of medication safety 
issues and clinical judgments when optimizing prescribing in older individuals. 
It uses the case of Mrs. Hansen, an aged nursing home resident, to illustrate 
the facilitators and barriers of this process. With decreasing life expectancy, 
medication use should shift from cure to care, focusing on symptomatic treatment 
to increase the patient's well-being. In Mrs. Hansen's case, the number of 
(potentially) dangerous medications were reduced, and non-pharmacological 
alternatives were considered. There were some medicines added, as 
underprescribing can also be a problem in older people. Deprescribing 
long-standing treatment can be interpreted by the patient and family as "giving 
up hope". More clinical evidence and practical communication tools are needed to 
guide deprescribing decisions, taking medical and patient-centered priorities 
into account. Studies evaluating such interventions should select outcome 
measures that are particularly relevant for frail old individuals.

PURPOSE: Dignity therapy is a psychosocial intervention that has been used 
primarily at the end of life to improve quality of life and other patient 
outcomes, but many individuals are unable to complete it due to health decline 
and death. The purpose of this study was to identify what individuals with 
advanced pancreatic or lung cancer with limited life expectancy, undergoing 
active cancer treatment describe during the dignity therapy intervention as 
important to them when not immediately facing end of life.
METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced cancer 
participated in a dignity therapy intervention study. Initial interviews were 
analyzed using descriptive content analysis.
RESULTS: Family provided the overall context and background for emerging themes 
of defining events, accomplishments, and God's plan, which led to lessons 
learned, and resulted in messages of hope. Interviews were often 
autobiographical in nature and contained much reminiscence, consistent with 
dignity therapy's intent. Few participants spoke about their cancer diagnoses 
during the interview.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds unique insight into the use of dignity therapy for 
those still receiving active cancer treatment, different from work by others in 
which it was offered only at end of life. As part of supportive care, clinicians 
need to validate the importance of family to those with advanced cancer and to 
provide opportunities for patients to share what they have learned throughout 
life and to impart messages of hope to those closest to them.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the perioperative and long-term 
results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients aged 60 or less and compare 
them to patients of more advanced age in a retrospective single-centre 
case-control study.
METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2014, 5893 consecutive CEAs were 
performed in our institution. Data concerning these interventions were 
prospectively inserted in a dedicated database. A retrospective analysis of that 
database was performed and 457 interventions performed in patients aged 60 or 
less were found (group 1). The control group was represented by 457 
interventions selected from the remaining 5436 by a one-to-one coarsened exact 
matching on the basis of all the baseline demographic and clinical covariates 
significantly different in the two groups (group 2). The two groups were 
compared in terms of intraoperative technical features and perioperative 
(<30 days) results of interventions (transient ischaemic attack-TIA, stroke and 
death rates) with χ 2 test. Follow-up data were analysed by life-table analysis 
(Kaplan-Meier test) in terms of survival, stroke-free and neurological 
symptom-free survival, freedom from severe restenosis and occlusion and freedom 
from reintervention, and the results in the two groups were compared by means of 
log rank test.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical 
presentation and of degree of carotid stenosis on operated side. 
Anaesthesiological and surgical details were also similar between the two 
groups. Thirty-day stroke and death rate was 0.6% in both groups (p = 0.9). 
Follow-up was available for 877 patients (96% of the study group) with a mean 
duration of 50 months. Estimated 10-year survival rates were 85% in group 1 (SE 
0.03) and 76% in group 2 (SE 0.04, p = 0.003, log rank 8.9). At the same time 
interval, stroke-free survival was also significantly better in group 1 (85%, SE 
0.035) than in group 2 (72.5%, SE 0.03; p = 0.002, log rank 10.1). The 
corresponding figures in terms of any neurological symptom-free survival were 
82.8% in group 1 (SE 0.04) and 70.3% in group 2 (SE 0.04, p = 0.002, log rank 
9.7). Estimated freedom from severe restenosis and occlusion was 76.5% in group 
1 (SE 0.04) and 88.5% in group 2 (SE 0.035, p = 0.001, log rank 11.9). Disease 
recurrence was symptomatic in six cases, three in each group. Estimated freedom 
from reintervention rates at 10 years was 87% in group 1 (SE 0.035) and 91.5% in 
group 2 (SE 0.03; p = 0.2, log rank 1.1).
CONCLUSIONS: CEA in patents aged 60 or less is safe and provides significantly 
better long-term results than those obtained in patients over 60 in terms of 
survival and stroke-free survival. Younger patients appear to have higher rates 
of recurrent carotid stenosis compared to the older cohort; however, these 
rarely require a secondary intervention.

PURPOSE: While education-based disparities in health are common, the extent to 
which chronic conditions contribute to education gaps and to consequent health 
disparities is not fully understood. As such, we sought to investigate 
educational aspirations, expectations, and attainment among youth with and 
without chronic conditions and to determine if these relationships mediated 
subsequent disparities in health and well-being.
METHODS: Longitudinal data on 3,518 youths are from the 1997-2013 Panel Study of 
Income Dynamics, a population-based survey. Multivariate regression was used to 
assess disparities in educational aspirations, expectations, and attainment by 
chronic conditions and the subsequent effects on health and well-being, 
adjusting for important potential confounders.
RESULTS: Youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMCs) did not report 
significantly lower educational aspirations than their healthy peers; however, 
YCMC reported lower expectations for their educational attainment and fewer YCMC 
had earned their desired degree by the end of follow-up (e.g., ≥bachelor's 
degree: 19.9% for YCMC vs. 26.0% for peers, p < .05). YCMC reported 
significantly worse general health, lower life satisfaction, and lower 
psychological well-being in young adulthood than did their healthy peers. These 
disparities persisted after adjustment for confounders; the association between 
chronic disease and health was partially, but significantly, mediated by actual 
educational attainment.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest an important risk mechanism through which YCMC may 
acquire socioeconomic disadvantage as they develop and progress through 
educational settings. Disproportionate lags in education, from expectation to 
attainment, may in turn increase YCMC's susceptibility to poor health and 
well-being in the future.

BACKGROUND: Japan has entered the era of super-ageing and advanced health 
transition, which is increasingly putting pressure on the sustainability of its 
health system. The level and pace of this health transition might vary across 
regions within Japan and concern is growing about increasing regional variations 
in disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive, comparable framework. We used 
data from GBD 2015 with the aim to quantify the burden of disease and injuries, 
and to attribute risk factors in Japan at a subnational, prefecture-level.
METHODS: We used data from GBD 2015 for 315 causes and 79 risk factors of death, 
disease, and injury incidence and prevalence to measure the burden of diseases 
and injuries in Japan and in the 47 Japanese prefectures from 1990 to 2015. We 
extracted data from GBD 2015 to assess mortality, causes of death, years of life 
lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in Japan and its 47 
prefectures. We split extracted data by prefecture and applied GBD methods to 
generate estimates of burden, and attributable burden due to known risk factors. 
We examined the prefecture-level relationships of common health system inputs 
(eg, health expenditure and workforces) to the GBD outputs in 2015 to address 
underlying determinants of regional health variations.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy at birth in Japan increased by 4·2 years from 79·0 
years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 79·0 to 79·0) to 83·2 years (83·1 to 83·2) 
between 1990 and 2015. However, the gaps between prefectures with the lowest and 
highest life expectancies and HALE have widened, from 2·5 to 3·1 years and from 
2·3 to 2·7 years, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Although overall 
age-standardised death rates decreased by 29·0% (28·7 to 29·3) from 1990 to 
2015, the rates of mortality decline in this period substantially varied across 
the prefectures, ranging from -32·4% (-34·8 to -30·0) to -22·0% (-20·4 to 
-20·1). During the same time period, the rate of age-standardised DALYs was 
reduced overall by 19·8% (17·9 to 22·0). The reduction in rates of 
age-standardised YLDs was very small by 3·5% (2·6 to 4·3). The pace of reduction 
in mortality and DALYs in many leading causes has largely levelled off since 
2005. Known risk factors accounted for 34·5% (32·4 to 36·9) of DALYs; the two 
leading behavioural risk factors were unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking in 
2015. The common health system inputs were not associated with age-standardised 
death and DALY rates in 2015.
INTERPRETATION: Japan has been successful overall in reducing mortality and 
disability from most major diseases. However, progress has slowed down and 
health variations between prefectures is growing. In view of the limited 
association between the prefecture-level health system inputs and health 
outcomes, the potential sources of regional variations, including subnational 
health system performance, urgently need assessment.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 
synchronous liver metastases (PACLM) have an extremely limited life expectancy. 
We performed a single-center analysis to explore the clinical results and 
prognostic factors of patients with PACLM receiving palliative care.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 189 patients undergoing palliative care at 
Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital over a 15-year period. Clinical 
characteristics, survival condition, and factors associated with survival were 
analyzed. Treatment methods included palliative bypass surgery, percutaneous 
transhepatic cholangiodrainage, drug analgesia, symptomatic treatment, and other 
nutritional or supportive measures.
RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) was 3.6 months for all patients. Multivariate 
analysis for clinical features showed that Karnofsky performance score (KPS), 
ascites, cigarette smoking, primary tumor size, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
were prognostic variables with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The patients 
were classified into three groups of patients according to how many of these 5 
risk factors were present: 0-1, 2, or 3-5 risk factors. The median OS of the 3 
groups of patients were 5.0, 3.3, and 2.5 months, respectively, with a notable 
statistical significance (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: KPS<80, ascites, cigarette smoking, primary tumor size≥5 cm, and 
LDH≥250U/L are effective predictive factors of poor prognosis for patients with 
PACLM. The stratification of treatment outcome groups based on these factors
