Review.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of 
PPV versus scleral buckling for the treatment of simple RRD (primary RRD of any 
extension with up to two clock hours large break(s) regardless of their 
anterior/posterior localisation) in people with (phakia) or without (aphakia) a 
natural lens in the eye, or with an artificial lens (pseudophakia). A secondary 
objective was to assess any data on economic and quality-of-life measures.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision 
Trials Register; MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; 
ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 5 December 
2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
PPV versus scleral buckling surgery with at least three months of follow-up.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology. Two review 
authors independently extracted the data and study characteristics from the 
studies identified as eligible after initial screening. We considered the 
following outcomes: primary retinal reattachment, postoperative visual acuity, 
final anatomical success, recurrence of retinal detachment, number of 
interventions needed to achieve final anatomical success, quality of life and 
adverse effects. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: This review included 10 RCTs (1307 eyes of 1307 participants) from 
Europe, India, Iran, Japan and Mexico, which compared PPV and scleral buckling 
for RRD repair. Two of these 10 studies compared PPV combined with scleral 
buckling with scleral buckling alone (54 participants). All studies were high or 
unclear risk of bias on at least one domain. Five studies were funded by 
non-commercial sources, while the other five studies did not report source of 
funding.There was little or no difference in the proportion of participants who 
achieved retinal reattachment at least 3 months after the operation in the PPV 
group compared to those in the scleral buckling group (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) 0.98 to 1.16; 9 RCTs, 1261 participants, low-certainty 
evidence). Approximately 67 in every 100 people treated with scleral buckling 
had retinal reattachment by 3 to 12 months. Treatment with PPV may result in 4 
more people with retinal reattachment in every 100 people treated (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 2 fewer to 11 more).There was no evidence of any 
important difference in postoperative visual acuity between participants in the 
PPV group compared to those in the scleral buckling group (mean difference (MD) 
0.00 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.10, 6 RCTs, 1138 participants, low-certainty 
evidence).There was little or no difference in final anatomical success between 
participants in the PPV group and scleral buckling group (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 
to 1.04, 9 RCTs, 1235 participants, low-certainty evidence). There were 94 out 
of 100 people treated with control (scleral buckling) that achieved final 
anatomical success compared to 96 out of 100 in the PPV group.Retinal 
redetachment was reported in fewer participants in the PPV group compared to the 
scleral buckling group (RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, 9 RCTs, 1320 participants, 
low-certainty evidence). Approximately 28 in every 100 people treated with 
scleral buckling had retinal detachment by 3 to 36 months. Treatment with PPV 
may result in seven fewer people with retinal detachment in every 100 people 
treated (95% CI 1 to 11 fewer).Participants treated with PPV on average needed 
fewer interventions to achieve final anatomical success but the difference was 
small and data were skewed (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06, 2 RCTs, 682 
participants, very low-certainty evidence).Very low-certainty evidence on 
quality of life suggested that more people in the PPV group were "satisfied with 
vision" compared with the scleral buckling group (RR 6.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 44.09, 
1 RCT, 32 participants).All included studies reported adverse effects, however, 
it was not always clear whether they were reported as number of participants or 
number of adverse effects. Cataract development or progression was more 
prevalent in the PPV group (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.01), choroidal detachment 
was more prevalent in the scleral buckling group (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.65) 
and new/iatrogenic breaks were observed only in the PPV group (RR 8.21, 95% CI 
1.91 to 35.21). Estimates of the relative frequency of other adverse effects, 
including postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy, postoperative increase 
in intraocular pressure, development of cystoid macular oedema, macular pucker 
and strabismus were imprecise. Evidence for adverse effects was low-certainty 
evidence.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low- or very low-certainty evidence indicates that there 
may be little or no difference between PPV and scleral buckling in terms of 
primary success rate, visual acuity gain and final anatomical success in 
treating primary RRD. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be less 
retinal redetachment in the PPV group. Some adverse events appeared to be more 
common in the PPV group, such as cataract progression and new iatrogenic breaks, 
whereas others were more commonly seen in the scleral buckling group such as 
choroidal detachment.

BACKGROUND: Scabies is a common dermatological condition, affecting more than 
130 million people at any time. To evaluate and/or predict the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions, disease transmission modelling can 
be used.
OBJECTIVE: To review published scabies models and data to inform the design of a 
comprehensive scabies transmission modelling framework to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions.
METHODS: Systematic literature search in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and 
the Cochrane Library identified scabies studies published since the year 2000. 
Selected papers included modelling studies and studies on the life cycle of 
scabies mites, patient quality of life and resource use. Reference lists of 
reviews were used to identify any papers missed through the search strategy. 
Strengths and limitations of identified scabies models were evaluated and used 
to design a modelling framework. Potential model inputs were identified and 
discussed.
FINDINGS: Four scabies models were published: a Markov decision tree, two 
compartmental models, and an agent-based, network-dependent Monte Carlo model. 
None of the models specifically addressed crusted scabies, which is associated 
with high morbidity, mortality, and increased transmission. There is a lack of 
reliable, comprehensive information about scabies biology and the impact this 
disease has on patients and society.
DISCUSSION: Clinicians and health economists working in the field of scabies are 
encouraged to use the current review to inform disease transmission modelling 
and economic evaluations on interventions against scabies.

Comparing the burden of dental conditions to other health outcomes provides 
useful insight for public policy. We aimed to estimate quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) loss due to dental conditions in the US adult population. 
Social inequalities in QALE loss by dental conditions were also examined. Data 
from 3 cross-sectional waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES waves 2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, and 2011 to 2012) were pooled 
and analyzed. The average age of study participants ( n = 9,445) was 48.4 y. 
Disutility scores were derived from self-rated health and the numbers of 
physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, and days with activity 
limitation, employing a previously published algorithm. The associations between 
the disutility scores and the numbers of decayed teeth, missing teeth, and 
periodontitis were examined by multiple linear regression stratified by age 
groups (20-39, 40-59, and ≥60 y), adjusted for other covariates (age, sex, wave 
fixed effect, educational attainment, smoking, and diabetes). The QALE loss due 
to dental conditions at the age of 20 was estimated using life tables. Decayed 
and missing teeth, but not periodontitis, were associated with a larger 
disutility score. The coefficient for decayed teeth was larger among the older 
population, whereas that of missing teeth was smaller among them. The estimated 
QALE loss was 0.43 y (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.59), which reached 
5.3% of QALE loss (8.15 y; 95% CI, 8.03-8.27) due to overall morbidity. There 
were clear social gradients in QALE loss by dental conditions across the life 
course, and people with high school or less education had 0.32 y larger QALE 
loss in total compared with people with college or more education. This study 
suggests that improvements in people's dental health may yield substantial gains 
in population health and well-being. The necessity of more comprehensive public 
health strategies is highlighted.

Macromolecular protein and peptide therapeutics have been proven to be effective 
in treating critical human diseases precisely. Thanks to biotechnological 
advancement, a huge number of proteins and peptide therapeutics were made their 
way to pharmaceutical market in past few decades. However, one of the biggest 
challenges to be addressed for protein therapeutics during clinical application 
is their fast degradation in serum and quick elimination owing to enzymatic 
degradation, renal clearance, liver metabolism and immunogenicity, attributing 
to the short half-lives. Size and hydrophobicity of protein molecules make them 
prone to kidney filtration and liver metabolism. On the other hand, proteasomes 
responsible for protein destruction possess the capability of specifically 
recognizing almost all kinds of foreign proteins while avoiding any unwanted 
destruction of cellular components. At present almost all protein-based drug 
formulations available in market are administered intravenously (IV) or 
subcutaneously (SC) with high dosing at frequent interval, eventually creating 
dose-fluctuation-related complications and reducing patient compliance vastly. 
Therefore, artificially increasing the therapeutic half-life of a protein by 
attaching to it a molecule that increases the overall size (eg, PEG) or helps 
with receptor mediated recycling (eg, albumin), or manipulating amino acid chain 
in a way that makes it more prone towards aggregate formation, are some of the 
revolutionary approaches to avoid the fast degradation in vivo. Half-life 
extension technologies that are capable of dramatically enhancing half-lives of 
proteins in circulation (2-100 folds) and thus improving their overall 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been successfully applied on a wide range 
of protein therapeutics from hormones and enzymes, growth factor, clotting 
factor to interferon. The focus of the review is to assess the technological 
advancements made so far in enhancing circulatory half-lives and improving 
therapeutic potency of proteins.

Platelets, the derivatives of megakaryocytes, pose dynamic biological functions 
such as homeostasis and wound healing. The mechanisms involved in these 
processes are utilized by cancerous cells for proliferation and metastasis. 
Platelets through their activation establish an aggregate termed as Tumor cell 
induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) that aids in establishing a niche for the 
primary tumor at secondary site while recruiting granulocytes and monocytes. The 
study of these close interactions between the tumor and the platelets can be 
exploited as biomarkers in liquid biopsy for early cancer detection, thereby 
increasing the life expectancy of cancer patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Complex benign rectal polyps can be managed with transanal 
surgery or with endoscopic resection (ER). Though the complication rate after ER 
is lower than transanal surgery, recurrence is higher. Patients lost to follow 
up after ER might therefore be at increased risk for rectal cancer. We evaluated 
the costs, benefits, and cost effectiveness of ER compared to 2 surgical 
techniques for removing complex rectal polyps, using a 50-year time horizon-this 
allowed us to capture rates of cancer development among patients lost from 
follow-up surveillance.
METHODS: We created a Markov model to simulate the lifetime outcomes and costs 
of ER, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), and transanal minimally invasive 
surgery (TAMIS) for the management of a complex benign rectal polyp. We assessed 
the effect of surveillance by allowing a portion of the patients to be lost to 
follow up. We calculated the cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or each intervention over a 50-year time 
horizon.
RESULTS: We found that TEM was slightly more effective than TAMIS and ER (TEM, 
19.54 QALYs; TAMIS, 19.53 QALYs; and ER, 19.53 QALYs), but ER had a lower 
lifetime discounted cost (ER cost $7161, TEM cost $10,459, and TAMIS cost 
$11,253). TEM was not cost effective compared to ER, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $485,333/QALY. TAMIS was dominated by TEM. 
TEM became cost effective when the mortality from ER exceeded 0.63%, or if the 
loss to follow up rate exceeded 25.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Markov model, we found that ER, TEM, and TAMIS have similar 
effectiveness, but ER is less expensive, in management of benign rectal polyps. 
As the rate of loss to follow up increases, transanal surgery becomes more 
effective relative to ER.

Protein therapeutics play a significant role in treating many diseases. They, 
however, suffer from patient's proteases degradation and antibody neutralization 
which lead to short plasma half-lives. One of the ways to overcome these 
pitfalls is the frequent injection of the drug albeit at the cost of patient 
compliance which affects the quality of life of patients. There are several 
techniques available to extend the half-life of therapeutics. Two of the most 
common protocols are PEGylation and fusion with human serum albumin. These two 
techniques improve stability, reduce immunogenicity, and increase drug 
resistance to proteases. These factors lead to the reduction of injection 
frequency which increases patient compliance and improve quality of life. Both 
techniques have already been used in many FDA approved drugs. This review 
describes many technologies to produce long-acting drugs with the attention of 
PEGylation and the genetic fusion with human serum albumin. The report also 
discusses the latest modified therapeutics in the field and their application in 
cancer therapy. We compare the modification methods and discuss the pitfalls of 
these modified drugs.

Many countries are raising the age of pension eligibility because of increases 
in life expectancy. Given the social gradient in life expectancy and health, it 
is important to understand the potential late-life health effects of prolonging 
working life and whether any effects differ by socioeconomic position. We 
examined the effect of prolonging working life beyond age 65 on mortality and a 
series of indicators of late-life physical health (the ability to climb stairs 
without difficulty, self-rated health, ADL limitations, and musculoskeletal 
pain) in a representative sample of the Swedish population. In addition to 
average effects, we also examined heterogeneous effects, for instance by 
occupational social class. To do this, we use propensity score matching, a 
method suitable for addressing causality in observational data. The data came 
from two linked Swedish longitudinal surveys based on nationally representative 
samples with repeated follow-ups; The Swedish Level of Living Survey and the 
Swedish Panel Study of Living conditions of the Oldest Old, and from national 
income and mortality registries. The analytical sample for the mortality outcome 
included 1852 people, and for late-life physical health outcomes 1461 people. We 
found no significant average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of working to 
age 66 or above on the outcomes, measured an average of 12 years after 
retirement: mortality (ATT -0.039), the ability to climb stairs (ATT -0.023), 
self-rated health (ATT -0.009), ADL limitations (ATT -0.023), or musculoskeletal 
pain (ATT -0.009) in late life. Analyses of whether the results varied by 
occupational social class or the propensity to prolong working life were 
inconclusive but suggest a positive effect of prolonging working life on health 
outcomes. Accordingly, more detailed knowledge about the precise mechanisms 
underlying these results are needed. In conclusion, working to age 66 or above 
did not have effect on mortality or late-life physical health.

BACKGROUND: Smartphones are increasingly available and some high quality apps 
are available for smoking cessation. However, the cost-effectiveness of 
promoting such apps has never been studied. We therefore aimed to estimate the 
health gain, inequality impacts and cost-utility from a five-year promotion 
campaign of a smoking cessation smartphone app compared to business-as-usual (no 
app use for quitting).
METHODS: A well-established Markov macro-simulation model utilising a 
multi-state life-table was adapted to the intervention (lifetime horizon, 3% 
discount rate). The setting was the New Zealand (NZ) population (N = 4.4 
million). The intervention effect size was from a multi-country randomised 
trial: relative risk for quitting at 6 months = 2.23 (95%CI: 1.08 to 4.77), 
albeit subsequently adjusted to consider long-term relapse. Intervention costs 
were based on NZ mass media promotion data and the NZ cost of attracting a 
smoker to smoking cessation services (NZ$64 per person).
RESULTS: The five-year intervention was estimated to generate 6760 QALYs (95%UI: 
5420 to 8420) over the remaining lifetime of the population. For Māori 
(Indigenous population) there was 2.8 times the per capita age-standardised QALY 
gain relative to non-Māori. The intervention was also estimated to be 
cost-saving to the health system (saving NZ$115 million [m], 95%UI: 72.5m to 
171m; US$81.8m). The cost-saving aspect of the intervention was maintained in 
scenario and sensitivity analyses where the discount rate was doubled to 6%, the 
effect size halved, and the intervention run for just 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides modelling-level evidence that mass-media 
promotion of a smartphone app for smoking cessation could generate health gain, 
reduce ethnic inequalities in health and save health system costs. Nevertheless, 
there are other tobacco control measures which generate considerably larger 
health gains and cost-savings such as raising tobacco taxes.

BACKGROUND: Female life expectancy and mortality rates have been improving over 
the course of many decades. Many global changes offer potential explanations. In 
this paper, we examined whether the United Nations Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has, in part, been 
responsible for the observed improvements in these key population metrics of 
women's health.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the United Nations Treaty Series Database, the 
World Bank World Development Indicators database and, the Polity IV database. 
Because CEDAW is nearly universally ratified, it was not feasible to compare 
ratifying countries to non-ratifying countries. We therefore applied interrupted 
times series analyses, which creates a comparator (counterfactual) scenario by 
using the trend in the health outcome before the policy exposure to 
mathematically determine what the trend in the health outcome would have been 
after the policy exposure, had the policy exposure not occurred. Analyses were 
stratified by country-level income and democratization.
RESULTS: Among low-income countries, CEDAW improved outcomes in democratic, but 
not non-democratic countries. In middle-income countries, CEDAW largely had no 
effect and, among high-income countries, had largely positive effects.
CONCLUSIONS: While population indicators of women's health have improved since 
CEDAW ratification, the impact of CEDAW ratification itself on these 
improvements varies across countries with differing levels of income and 
democratization.

Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage 
disease affecting the visceral organs and the central nervous system. The age of 
initial presentation varies from fetal to adult onset, although childhood onset 
is most common. The life expectancy for the full spectrum of NPC patients is not 
well defined, and it is unknown if current supportive care impacts the natural 
history. In order to assess age of death for a large cohort of NPC patients, we 
"crowd-sourced" age and year of death from information posted on disease support 
group website memorial walls. We analyzed data from 338 individuals who died 
between 1968 and 2018. In addition to age of death, gender can be inferred from 
given names and photographs. The median age of death was 13 years with a range 
from 0.1-69 years. Although sex significantly affects survival of NPC1 mutant 
mice, we did not observe a gender dependent survival difference in NPC patients. 
Median age of survival across time increased between the earliest patients and 
the most recently deceased patient; however, we found no significant change in 
survival over the last 20 years. These data suggest that supportive medical care 
has not impacted survival in the recent past and provides support for the use of 
historic controls in evaluating therapeutic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Hypogastric artery aneurysms (HAAs) are rare but life-threatening in 
cases of rupture. Open or endovascular techniques traditionally aimed at 
occluding the hypogastric artery (HA) have considerable risk of pelvic ischemia. 
Iliac branch devices (IBDs) are indicated for aortoiliac aneurysms; however, 
they have also been used lately for HAAs. Currently, there are no reports about 
patient outcomes focusing on HAA therapy using IBDs. We retrospectively analyzed 
early and midterm outcomes using IBDs for HAAs.
METHODS: Patients who received IBDs for HAAs at our department from January 1, 
2012, through March 1, 2018, were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
no HA involvement, emergency procedures, and HA stent grafting without IBD. 
Perioperative and follow-up data were collected from medical records.
RESULTS: There were 18 IBDs (only IBD, n = 4; IBD + endovascular aneurysm repair 
[EVAR], n = 7; IBD ± EVAR + side branch occlusion, n = 7) implanted into 14 male 
patients (76 ± 4 [70-83] years). There were no intraoperative complications, and 
the technical success rate was 100%. After 19 ± 11 (2-39) months of follow-up, 
two hybrid (external iliac artery occlusion, n = 1; EVAR graft kinking, n = 1) 
and four endovascular reinterventions due to two type IB (side branch coiling + 
stent graft extension) and two type IIIB (stent grafting) endoleaks were 
required. One IBD-related type II endoleak revealed constant aneurysm diameters 
during follow-up. One small type IB endoleak was self-limited. Estimated freedom 
from reintervention was 31% ± 23% at 2.7 years. The clinical success and patency 
rate was 100%. The IBD-related mortality was 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: The IBD for HAA shows good early and midterm results. Adequate 
sealing of HA landing zones and side branch occlusion are technically 
challenging but crucial to prevent type IB and type II endoleaks.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing palliative treatment 
receive extensive treatment-related information throughout their disease 
trajectory. We aimed to explore the experiences of patients with incurable 
colorectal cancer while in palliative care and their reflections on the 
information provided by physicians and nurses. Our main focus was the patients' 
thoughts about how information about disease status and life expectancy was 
communicated, from the first time that they were informed about the incurable 
nature of their disease through to postsurgery palliative treatment.
SETTINGS: Patients with colorectal cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.
RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a qualitative approach, and the data were analysed by 
qualitative content analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: 20 patients (34-75 years of age) were included in the study; 12 
received first-line chemotherapy and 8 received second-line chemotherapy. Eleven 
patients were treated by oncologists, and nine were treated by junior 
physicians.
RESULTS: Data-driven empirical analysis identified three themes: (1) inadequate 
information during the initial phase of the disease trajectory; (2) hope and 
information further into the disease trajectory and (3) personal, professional 
and organisational factors that influenced information and communication 
throughout the disease trajectory.
CONCLUSION: The participants' experience of being told for the first time that 
they had an incurable disease was perceived as inadequate, while postsurgery 
palliative chemotherapy, physicians and nurses offered hope. The participants 
preferred customised information about their treatment and likely future 
prospects and physicians and nurses who took a holistic and compassionate 
approach focusing on their lifeworld. To be a sensitive, holistic and 
compassionate physician or nurse requires knowledge and confidence. To achieve 
this requires training and guidance at universities and in hospitals.

INTRODUCTION: The Community Ageing Research 75+ Study (CARE75+) is a 
longitudinal cohort study collecting an extensive range of health, social and 
economic data, with a focus on frailty, independence and quality of life in 
older age. CARE75+ is the first international experimental frailty research 
cohort designed using Trial within Cohorts (TwiCs) methodology, to align applied 
epidemiological research with clinical trial evaluation of interventions to 
improve the health and well-being of older people living with frailty.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective cohort study using a TwiCs design. One 
thousand community-dwelling older people (≥75 years) will be recruited from UK 
general practices. Nursing home residents, those with an estimated life 
expectancy of 3 months or less and people receiving palliative care will be 
excluded. Data collection assessments will be face to face in the person's home 
at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 48 months, including assessments 
of frailty, cognition, mood, health-related quality of life, comorbidity, 
medications, resilience, loneliness, pain and self-efficacy. A modified protocol 
for follow-up by telephone or web based will be offered at 6 months. Consent 
will be sought for data linkage and invitations to additional studies, including 
intervention studies using the TwiCs design. A blood sample biobank will be 
established for future basic science studies.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: CARE75+ was approved by the NRES Committee Yorkshire 
and the Humber-Bradford Leeds 10 October 2014 (14/YH/1120). Formal written 
consent is sought if an individual is willing to participate and has capacity to 
provide informed consent. Consultee assent is sought if an individual lacks 
capacity.Study results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals 
and scientific conferences. Key study results will be summarised and 
disseminated to all study participants via newsletters, local older people's 
publications and local engagement events. Results will be reported on a bespoke 
CARE75+ website.

OBJECTIVE: Stark health inequalities exist in the present day between the North 
and South of England, with people in the South, overall, experiencing better 
health across a range of parameters (e.g., life expectancy and number of years 
spent in good health). Bioarchaeological studies of skeletal remains from 
cemeteries across this geographical divide have the ability to provide a 
temporal perspective on the etiology, longevity, and nature of this disparity.
METHODS: In total 574 non-adults (0-17 years) from six urban sites (c. AD 
1711-1856) were analyzed from the North and South of England. Measurements of 
long bone length, cortical thickness, and vertebral dimensions were analyzed 
alongside both skeletal and dental palaeopathological data to assess patterns of 
disease and growth disruption between skeletal samples.
RESULTS: There were few significant differences in growth parameters between the 
six sites in relation to geographical location. However, the northern-based 
sample Coach Lane (North Shields) demonstrated some of the highest rates of 
pathology, with metabolic disease being particularly prevalent.
DISCUSSION: Northern and southern populations suffered alike from the 
detrimental environmental conditions associated with urban centers of the 
18th-19th centuries. However, the elevated prevalence of vitamin D deficiency 
seen within the Coach Lane sample is indicative of a regionally specific risk 
that may be related to latitude, and/or the influence of particular industries 
operating in the North-East.

BACKGROUND: Traditional metrics for population health ageing tend not to 
differentiate between extending life expectancy and adding healthy years. A 
population ageing metric that reflects both longevity and health status, 
incorporates a comprehensive range of diseases, and allows for comparisons 
across countries and time is required to understand the progression of ageing 
and to inform policies.
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2017, we developed a metric that reflects age-related morbidity and mortality at 
the population level. First, we identified a set of age-related diseases, 
defined as diseases with incidence rates among the adult population increasing 
quadratically with age, and measured their age-related burden, defined as the 
sum of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of these diseases among adults. 
Second, we estimated age-standardised age-related health burden across 195 
countries between 1990 and 2017. Using global average 65-year-olds as the 
reference population, we calculated the equivalent age in terms of age-related 
disease burden for all countries. Third, we analysed how the changes in 
age-related burden during the study period relate to different factors with a 
decomposition analysis. Finally, we describe how countries with similar levels 
of overall age-related burden experience different onsets of ageing. We 
represent the uncertainty of our estimates by calculating uncertainty intervals 
(UI) from 1000 draw-level estimates for each disease, country, year, and age.
FINDINGS: 92 diseases were identified as age related, accounting for 51·3% (95% 
UI 48·5-53·9) of all global burden among adults in 2017. Across the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), the rate of age-related burden ranged from 137·8 
DALYs (128·9-148·3) per 1000 adults in high SDI countries to 265·9 DALYs 
(251·0-280·1) in low SDI countries. The equivalent age to average 65-year-olds 
globally spanned from 76·1 years (75·6-76·7) in Japan to 45·6 years (42·6-48·2) 
in Papua New Guinea. Age-standardised age-related disease rates have decreased 
over time across all SDI levels and regions between 1990 and 2017, mainly due to 
decreases in age-related case fatality and disease severity. Even among 
countries with similar age-standardised death rates, large differences in the 
onset and patterns of accumulating age-related burden exist.
INTERPRETATION: The new metric facilitates the shift from thinking not just 
about chronological age but the health status and disease severity of ageing 
populations. Our findings could provide inputs into policymaking by identifying 
key drivers of variation in the ageing burden and resources required for 
addressing the burden.

Background Little is known of the impact of social factors on mortality after 
coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ). We explored sex- and age-specific 
associations between mortality risk after CABG and marital status, income, and 
education. Methods and Results This population-based register study included 
110 742 CABG patients (21.3% women) from the SWEDEHEART registry (Swedish 
Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based Care in Heart 
Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) operated 1992 to 2015. Cox 
regression models were used to study the relation between social factors and 
all-cause mortality. Never having been married compared with being 
married/cohabiting was associated with a higher risk in women than in men 
(hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.20-1.44) versus 1.17 (1.13-1.22), P=0.030 between 
sex. The lowest income quintile, compared with the highest, was associated with 
higher risk in men than in women (hazard ratio 1.44 [1.38-1.51] versus 1.25 
[1.14-1.38], P=0.0036). Lowest education level was associated with higher risk 
without sex difference (hazard ratio 1.15 [1.11-1.19] versus 1.25 [1.16-1.35], 
P=0.75). For unmarried women aged 60 years at surgery with low income and low 
education, mortality 10 years after surgery was 18%, compared with 11% in 
married women with high income and higher education level. The median life 
expectancy was 4.8 years shorter. Corresponding figures for 60-year-old men were 
21% versus 12% mortality risk at 10 years and 5.0 years shorter life expectancy. 
Conclusions There are strong associations between social factors and mortality 
risk after CABG in both men and women. These results emphasize the importance of 
developing and implementing secondary prevention strategies for CABG patients 
with disadvantages in social factors.

INTRODUCTION: Intravascular leiomyoma is a rare type of myoma. It was firstly 
described by Birch-Hirschfeld in 1896, however, its intracardiac subtype was 
firstly reported by Durck in 1907. Most patients are asymptomatic. The tumor 
invades mostly the tributaries of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with upward 
extension that may approach the intracardiac space.
AIM: By means of a scientific case report, a patient with the very rare 
diagnosis of an endocaval leiomyoma thrombus post-hysterectomy is described 
based on the clinical experiences obtained in the specific case management and 
selective references from the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-years old female was diagnosed with intravascular tumor 
growth within the IVC with intracardiac extension using chest and abdominal CT 
scan, ECG and echocardiography which was approached by an interdisciplinary 
(vascular and cardiothoracic) surgical intervention (278 min) including 
heart-lung machine (99 min) with favorable postoperative result (R0 resection 
status with mid-term outcome, no recurrent tumor growth). Histopathological 
investigation diagnosed leiomyoma origin already from ovarian vein most likely 
in context to the former hysterectomy (3 years ago).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Intravascular leiomyoma is a benign tumor with 
invasive tendency, which can be considered a diagnostic and therapeutic 
challenge. It should be thoroughly investigated to be planned for a radical 
surgical removal. By possible adherence to the intraabdominal or -thoracic 
organs, an interdisciplinary and eventually step-wise surgical approach 
(combining vascular, abdominal, thoracic and heart surgery as well as gynecology 
and urology), which can be demanding, is recommended to be seriously considered 
to i) reliably achieve R0 resection status and, thus, ii) provide best outcome, 
quality of life and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the cancer burden in adults aged 65 years and older in 
Latin America and the Caribbean to serve as rational for improving cancer 
control planning among region's older population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the up-to-date GLOBOCAN estimates for 2018, we 
describe the cancer burden including key patterns for the major cancer sites 
among adults aged 65 years and older in Latin America and the Caribbean. We also 
predict the future burden in 2040 by applying population projections, assuming 
no changes in incidence rates over time.
RESULTS: In 2018, an estimated 679,000 new cancer cases occurred among older 
adults in LAC, representing almost half (48%) of the total incidence burden (43% 
in Central America, 49% in South America, and 52% in the Caribbean). Prostate, 
colorectum, and lung were the most common cancers among older males in South 
America and the Caribbean, with non-melanoma skin cancer ranking third in 
Central America. Among older females, the most common sites were breast, 
colorectum, and non-melanoma skin cancer, except in the Caribbean, where lung
