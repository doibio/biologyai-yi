BACKGROUND: High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains essential 
to improve the outcome of patients in sudden cardiorespiratory arrest. Feedback 
on performance is a crucial component of the learning processes associated with 
simulation and has been shown to improve CPR quality during simulated cardiac 
arrest on mannequins. This study aims to evaluate skills acquisition using a new 
low-cost feedback device for CPR self-training when compared to standard 
training methods.
METHODS: Thirty-nine pregraduated medical and biomedical engineering students 
were recruited for a longitudinal double-blinded randomized control study. For 
training Basic Life Support skills, the control group used a standard 
task-trainer and received feedback from an instructor. The intervention group 
used the same standard task-trainer, instrumented with the CPR Personal Trainer 
that provided automated performance feedback (with no instructor) on 
compression-related parameters. Students' knowledge and skills were assessed 
before and after training, through a theoretical knowledge test and 2 minutes of 
CPR practical performance.
RESULTS: The theoretical tests showed an improvement both in the intervention 
and in the control group. For each compression-related parameters (hands 
position, recoil, rate, and depth), significant increase in scores is observed, 
between the pre- and the post-test, in both groups. The intervention and control 
groups presented identical mean differences for the total score (0.72 vs 0.72), 
with no statistical difference (P = 0.754).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tool proved to be effective in the acquisition of 
compression-related skills, with similar outcomes as the traditional 
instructor-based method, corroborating the hypothesis that a low-cost tool with 
feedback for CPR self-training can provide an alternative or a complementary 
extension to traditional training methods. The system can also be considered 
cost-efficient as it reduces the permanent presence of an instructor for the 
chest compressions training, promoting regular training outside formal training 
courses.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol-related liver disease is often undetected until 
irreversible late-stage decompensated disease manifests. Consequently, there is 
an unmet need for effective and economically reasonable pathways to screen for 
advanced alcohol-related fibrosis.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used real-world data from a large biopsy-controlled 
study of excessive drinkers recruited from primary and secondary care, to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four primary care initiated strategies: (1) 
routine liver function tests with follow-up ultrasonography for test-positives, 
(2) the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test with hospital liver stiffness 
measurement (LSM) for positives, (3) a three-tier strategy using the Forns Index 
to control before strategy 2, and (4) direct referral of all to LSM. We used 
linked decision trees and Markov models to evaluate outcomes short term 
(cost-per-accurate diagnosis) and long term (quality-adjusted life-years 
[QALYs]). For low-prevalence populations, ELF with LSM follow-up was most 
cost-effective, both short term (accuracy 96%, $196 per patient) and long term 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] $5,387-$8,430/QALY), depending on 
whether diagnostic testing had lasting or temporary effects on abstinence rates. 
Adding Forns Index decreased costs to $72 per patient and accuracy to 95%. The 
strategy resulted in fewer QALYs due to more false negatives but an ICER of 
$3,012, making this strategy suited for areas with restricted access to ELF and 
transient elastography or lower willingness-to-pay. For high-prevalence 
populations, direct referral to LSM was highly cost-effective (accuracy 93%, 
$297 per patient), with ICERs between $490 and $1,037/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive screening for advanced alcohol-related fibrosis is a 
cost-effective intervention when different referral pathways are used according 
to the prevalence of advanced fibrosis. Patients in the primary health care 
sector should be tested with the ELF test followed by LSM if the test was 
positive, whereas direct referral to LSM is highly cost-effective in 
high-prevalence cohorts.

Assessments of both neural and muscular adaptations during interventions would 
provide valuable information for developing countermeasures to age-related 
muscle dysfunctions. We investigated the effect of fish protein ingestion on 
training-induced neural and muscular adaptations in older adults. Twenty older 
adults participated 8 weeks of isometric knee extension training intervention. 
The participants were divided into two groups who took fish protein (n = 10, 
Alaska pollack protein, APP) or casein (n = 10, CAS). Maximal muscle strength 
during knee extension, lower extremity muscle mass (body impedance method), and 
motor unit firing pattern of knee extensor muscle (high-density surface 
electromyography) were measured before, during, and after the intervention. 
Muscle strength were significantly increased in both CAS (124.7 ± 5.8%) and APP 
(117.1 ± 4.4%) after intervention (p < .05), but no significant differences 
between the groups were observed (p > .05). Significant increases in lower 
extremity muscle mass from 0 to 8 weeks were demonstrated only for APP (102.0 ± 
3.2, p < .05). Greater changes in motor unit firing pattern following 
intervention were represented in CAS more than in APP. These results suggest 
that nutritional supplementations could modulate neural and muscular adaptations 
following resistance training and fish protein ingestion preferentially induces 
muscular adaptation without the detectable neural adaptation in older adults.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease are at increased risk of postoperative 
venous thromboembolism. Historically, extended outpatient prophylaxis has not 
met conventional measures of societal cost-benefit advantage. However, extended 
prophylaxis for patients with Crohn's disease may be more cost-effective because 
of the patients' high thrombotic risk and long life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of extended 
prophylaxis in patients with Crohn's disease after abdominal surgery.
DESIGN: A decision tree model was used to assess the incremental 
cost-effectiveness and cost per case averted with extended-duration venous 
thromboembolism prophylaxis following abdominal surgery.
SETTING: The risk of a postdischarge thrombotic event, age at surgery, type of 
thrombotic event, prophylaxis risk reduction, bleeding complications, and 
mortality were estimated by using existing published sources.
PATIENTS: Studied were patients with Crohn's disease versus routine care.
INTERVENTION: We constructed a decision analysis to compare costs and outcomes 
in patients with Crohn's disease postoperatively with and without extended 
prophylaxis over a lifetime horizon.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Productivity costs ($) and benefits (quality-adjusted 
life-year) were used to reflect a societal perspective and were time discounted 
at 3%. Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis accounted for 
uncertainty in probabilities, costs, and utility weights.
RESULTS: With the use of reference parameters, the individual expected societal 
total cost of care was $399.83 without and $1387.95 with prophylaxis. Preventing 
a single mortality with prophylaxis would cost $43.00 million (number needed to 
treat: 39,839 individuals). The incremental cost was $1.90 million per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Adjusting across a range of scenarios upheld these 
conclusions 88% of the time. With further sensitivity testing, subpopulations 
with postdischarge thrombosis rates greater than 4.9% favors postoperative 
extended-duration venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.
LIMITATIONS: Further investigation is needed to determine if specific high-risk 
individuals can be preemptively identified in the Crohn's surgical population 
for targeted prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Extended prophylaxis in patients with Crohn's disease 
postoperatively is not cost-effective when the cumulative incidence of 
posthospital thrombosis remains less than 4.9%. These findings are driven by the 
low absolute risk of thrombosis in this population and the considerable cost of 
universal treatment. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A998.

BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a diaphyseal stem may risk bone 
loss. In order to save proximal bone stock in young patients with a high 
activity level and a long life expectancy, the interest in short stems has 
evolved. The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study was to 
evaluate the fixation of, and bone remodeling around, the Primoris femoral 
neck-preserving hip implant.
METHODS: Fifty younger patients with end-stage osteoarthritis were managed with 
the Primoris hip implant. We evaluated bone mineral density (BMD) using dual 
x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and implant migration using radiostereometric 
analysis (RSA). A region-of-interest (ROI) protocol for 4 ROIs was applied to 
assess BMD. The association between BMD and migration was evaluated to determine 
the fixation of the Primoris implant and bone remodeling in the proximal part of 
the femur. Follow-up evaluation was performed at regular intervals from day 1 
(baseline) until 24 months after surgery.
RESULTS: The major stem migrations were subsidence (Y axis; mean, 0.38 mm) at 6 
weeks and varus tilt (rotation) (Z axis; mean, 0.93°) at 6 to 12 months. In ROI4 
(the calcar area), a significant gain in bone was found with a mean difference 
of 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8% to 7.4%; p < 0.02) at 24 months 
postoperatively. Significant bone loss was found in ROI1 and ROI2, with a mean 
difference of -4.9% (95% CI, -7.4% to -2.4%; p = 0.0003) and -8.9% (95% CI, 
-11.5% to -6.2%; p = 0.0001), respectively. Linear regression and multivariate 
regression analysis showed a significant negative association between maximal 
total point motion and BMD (p = 0.02, R = 15%; and p < 0.05, R = 26%, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The Primoris component showed satisfactory primary stability with 
promising results at the 24-month follow-up. DXA scans showed limited 
stress-shielding with the proximal loading pattern of the Primoris. Better bone 
quality was associated with less implant migration.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer imposes a substantial health burden worldwide 
including in Australia and is caused by persistent infection with one of 13 
sexually transmitted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types. The objective 
of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding a nonavalent new 
Gardasil-9® (9vHPV) vaccine to the national immunisation schedule in Australia 
across three different delivery strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and 
Economics (PRIME) model was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV 
vaccine introduction to prevent HPV infection. Academic literature and anecdotal 
evidence were included on the demographic variables, cervical cancer incidence 
and mortality, treatment costs, and vaccine delivery costs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured per disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) averted, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold defined 
by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Analyses and data from international 
agencies were used in scenario analysis from the health system and societal 
perspectives.
RESULTS: The 9vHPV vaccination was estimated to prevent 113 new cases of 
cervical cancer (discounted) during a 20-year period. From the health system and 
societal perspectives, the 9vHPV vaccination was very cost-effective in 
comparison with the status quo, with an ICER of A$47,008 and A$44,678 per DALY 
averted, respectively, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold level. 
Considering delivery strategies, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$47,605, 
A$46,682, and A$46,738 for school, health facilities, and outreach-based 
vaccination programs from the health system perspective, wherein, from the 
societal perspective, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$46,378, A$43,729, 
A$43,930, respectively. All estimates of ICERs fell below the threshold level 
(A$73,267).
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-effectiveness evaluation suggests that the routine 
two-dose 9vHPV vaccination strategy of preadolescent girls against HPV is very 
cost-effective in Australia from both the health system and societal 
perspectives. If equally priced, the 9vHPV option is the most economically 
viable vaccine. Overall, this analysis seeks to contribute to an evidence-based 
recommendation about the new 9vHPV vaccination in the national immunisation 
program in Australia.

E-FAST (Extended-Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is now a widely 
utilized and internationally recognized standard exam in trauma care. It is 
highly accepted by emergency physicians and trauma surgeons alike. Thanks to the 
popularity of PoCUS (point-of-care ultrasound), it has continued to evolve over 
the last years and can now improve trauma diagnosis at all stages of the primary 
ABCDE. This review article summarizes key observations made over recent years 
and also highlights the extension of FAST into E-FAST in the context of PoCUS 
and CT developments for modern trauma management. Time has come to learn the 
lessons from 25 years of FAST and 15 years of E-FAST. We should redefine and 
position ultrasound in the primary ATLS survey (Advanced Trauma Life Support) on 
two levels: 1. Basic ATLS with new clinical questions, six additional abdominal 
image sections and one or more follow-up examinations depending on the clinical 
situation, and 2. Advanced ATLS with ultrasound applications for the entire 
trauma ABCDE.

Publisher: Der E-FAST (Extended-Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) 
ist heute ein international anerkannter Standard, hoch akzeptiert und hat eine 
breite Anwendung bei Notfallmedizinern und Trauma-Chirurgen gefunden. Dank der 
Popularität von PoCUS (Point-of-care-Ultraschall) hat er sich über die letzten 
Jahre weiterentwickelt und kann die Trauma-Diagnostik auf allen Stufen des 
primären ABCDE verbessern. Dieses Review fasst die wichtigsten Erkenntnisse der 
letzten Jahre zusammen und zeigt die Erweiterung und den Stellenwert des E-FAST 
im Kontext der fokussierten PoCUS- und CT-Bewegung für das moderne 
Trauma-Management auf. Es ist höchste Zeit, dass wir die Lehren aus 25 Jahren 
FAST und 15 Jahren E-Komponente ziehen und den Ultraschall in der primären 
ATLS-Phase (Advanced Trauma Life Support) neu auf 2 Stufen definieren und 
positionieren: 1. Basisteil mit neuen Fragestellungen, 6 zusätzlichen 
abdominalen Bildschnitten sowie je nach Situation 1 oder mehrere 
Verlaufsuntersuchungen und 2. Aufbauteil mit Ultraschallapplikationen für das 
ganze Trauma-ABCDE.

PURPOSE:  Accurate characterization of testicular lesions is crucial to allow 
for correct treatment of malignant tumors and to avoid unnecessary procedures in 
benign ones. In recent years, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) proved to be 
superior in specifying the dignity of small, nonpalpable testicular lesions 
(< 1.5 cm) compared to native B-mode and color Doppler ultrasound which were 
previously regarded as the primary imaging method. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of CEUS has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this study was 
to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CEUS as compared to unenhanced ultrasound 
for the characterization of nonpalpable testicular lesions.
METHODS:  A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with unenhanced ultrasound 
and CEUS. Model input parameters were obtained from recent literature. 
Deterministic sensitivity analysis of diagnostic parameters and costs was 
performed. Also, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo Modelling 
was applied. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100 000/QALY.
RESULTS:  In the base-case scenario, unenhanced ultrasound resulted in total 
costs of $5113.14 and an expected effectiveness of 8.29 QALYs, whereas CEUS 
resulted in total costs of $4397.77 with 8.35 QALYs. Therefore, the unenhanced 
ultrasound strategy was dominated by CEUS in the base-case scenario. Sensitivity 
analysis showed CEUS to be the cost-effective alternative along a broad range of 
costs.
CONCLUSION:  Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a cost-effective imaging method for 
the characterization of nonpalpable testicular lesions.

Publisher: ZIEL:  Die korrekte Charakterisierung von Hodenläsionen ist 
entscheidend für die Einleitung der korrekten Behandlung bei malignen Tumoren 
sowie zur Vermeidung unnötiger Prozeduren bei benignen Tumoren. In den letzten 
Jahren erwies sich der kontrastmittelverstärkte Ultraschall (CEUS) zur 
Bestimmung der Dignität von kleinen, nichtpalpablen Hodenläsionen (< 1,5 cm) als 
überlegen, verglichen mit dem nativen B-Mode- und Farbdoppler-Ultraschall, 
welche zuvor als die primären Bildgebungsmethoden angesehen wurden. Jedoch wurde 
die Kosteneffektivität von CEUS in diesem Zusammenhang noch nicht analysiert. 
Ziel dieser Studie war es, die Kosteneffektivität von CEUS hinsichtlich der 
Charakterisierung nichtpalpabler Hodenläsionen im Vergleich zum nativen 
Ultraschall zu evaluieren.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN:  Ein Entscheidungsmodell basierend auf 
Markov-Simulationen errechnete die mit einer nativen Ultraschalluntersuchung 
sowie CEUS assoziierten Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALY). Die Input-Parameter 
basierten auf der aktuell verfügbaren Literatur. Deterministische und 
probabalistische Sensitivitätsanalysen basierend auf Monte-Carlo-Simulationen 
(PSA) wurden verwendet, um die Unsicherheit der Modellergebnisse zu schätzen. 
Die Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) wurde mit 100 000$/QALY festgelegt.
ERGEBNISSE:  In der Base-Case-Analyse für eine WTP von 100 000$ pro QALY 
resultierte der native Ultraschall in Gesamtkosten von 5113,14$ bei einer 
erwarteten Effektivität von 8,29 QALYs, während CEUS zu Gesamtkosten von 
4397,77$ bei 8,35 QALYs führte. Somit wird die Strategie nativer Ultraschall von 
der Strategie CEUS in der Base-Case-Analyse dominiert.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG:  CEUS ist eine kosteneffektive Bildgebungsmethode zur 
Charakterisierung nichtpalpabler Hodenläsionen.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation 
aid used in routine stop smoking services in England.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the National Health 
Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective for 12-month 
periods and life-time. Costs, including that of both treatments, other smoking 
cessation help and health-care services, and health benefits, estimated from 
EQ-5D-5L and measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), for the 12-month 
analysis, came from a randomized controlled trial. Life-time analysis was 
model-based with input from both trial data and published secondary data 
sources. Cost-effectiveness was measured by an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER).
SETTING: Three stop-smoking service sites in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult smokers (n = 886) who sought help to quit in the 
participating sites.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: An e-cigarette (EC) starter kit versus provision of 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for up to 3 months, both with standard 
behavioural support. A total of 886 participants were randomized (439 in the EC 
arm, 447 in the NRT arm). Excluding one death in each arm, the 1-year quit rate 
was 18.0 and 9.9%, respectively.
MEASUREMENTS: Cost of treatments was estimated from the treatment log. Costs of 
other smoking cessation help and health-care services and EQ-5D-5 L were 
collected at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Incremental costs and 
incremental QALYs were estimated using regression adjusting for baseline 
covariates and their respective baseline values.
FINDINGS: The ICER was £1100 per QALY gained at the 12 months after quit date 
(87% probability below £20 000/QALY). Markov model estimated the life-time ICER 
of EC to be £65 per QALY (85% probability below £20 000/QALY).
CONCLUSION: Using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid with standard 
behavioural support in stop-smoking services in England is likely to be more 
cost-effective than using nicotine replacement therapy in the same setting.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant 
treatments in resected pancreatic cancer.Methods: A Markov model was developed 
to mimic the disease process of postoperative pancreatic cancer, encompassing 
three health states (relapse-free survival, recurrent disease, and death). 
Health outcomes and utility scores were derived from the phase III trial and 
available literature. Cost data were calculated using standard fee data from the 
West China Hospital for 2017. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were developed to explore model uncertainty.Results: 
Treatment with S-1 was estimated to yield 1.61 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) at a cost of $25,696, whereas treatment with gemcitabine yielded 1.27 
QALYs at a cost of $28,930. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of S-1 
versus gemcitabine was $-9,490 per QALY. Based on the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $25,841 per QALY, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was $15,786 for 
S-1 and $3,727 for gemcitabine, generating the incremental NMB of $12,059. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probabilities of S-1 and 
gemcitabine being cost-effective were 92% and 8%, respectively. Results were 
robust to changes in parameters.Conclusion: Adjuvant therapy using S-1 is a 
cost-effective alternative compared to gemcitabine in patients with 
postoperative pancreatic cancer from the Chinese societal perspective.

The ESCRT-0 Protein HRS Interacts with the Human T Cell Leukemia Virus Type 2 
Antisense Protein APH-2 and Suppresses Viral Replication.

The divergent clinical outcomes of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 
and HTLV-2 infections have been attributed to functional differences in their 
antisense proteins. In contrast to HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), the role of the 
antisense protein of HTLV-2 (APH-2) in HTLV-2 infection is poorly understood. In 
previous studies, we identified the endosomal sorting complex required for 
transport 0 (ESCRT-0) subunit HRS as a novel interaction partner of APH-2 but 
not HBZ. HRS is a master regulator of endosomal protein sorting for lysosomal 
degradation and is hijacked by many viruses to promote replication. However, no 
studies to date have shown a link between HTLVs and HRS. In this study, we 
sought to characterize the interaction between HRS and APH-2 and to investigate 
the impact of HRS on the life cycle of HTLV-2. We confirmed a direct specific 
interaction between APH-2 and HRS and showed that the CC2 domain of HRS and the 
N-terminal domain of APH-2 mediate their interaction. We demonstrated that HRS 
recruits APH-2 to early endosomes, possibly furnishing an entry route into the 
endosomal/lysosomal pathway. We demonstrated that inhibition of this pathway 
using either bafilomycin or HRS overexpression substantially extends the 
half-life of APH-2 and stabilizes Tax2B expression levels. We found that HRS 
enhances Tax2B-mediated long terminal repeat (LTR) activation, while depletion 
of HRS enhances HTLV-2 production and release, indicating that HRS may have a 
negative impact on HTLV-2 replication. Overall, our study provides important new 
insights into the role of the ESCRT-0 HRS protein, and by extension the ESCRT 
machinery and the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, in HTLV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE 
While APH-2 is the only viral protein consistently expressed in infected 
carriers, its role in HTLV-2 infection is poorly understood. In this study, we 
characterized the interaction between the ESCRT-0 component HRS and APH-2 and 
explored the role of HRS in HTLV-2 replication. HRS is a master regulator of 
protein sorting for lysosomal degradation, a feature that is manipulated by 
several viruses to promote replication. Unexpectedly, we found that HRS targets 
APH-2 and possibly Tax2B for lysosomal degradation and has an overall negative 
impact on HTLV-2 replication and release. The negative impact of interactions 
between HTLV-2 regulatory proteins and HRS, and by extension the ESCRT 
machinery, may represent an important strategy used by HTLV-2 to limit virus 
production and to promote persistence, features that may contribute to the 
limited pathogenic potential of this infection.

[New therapeutic directions on hemophilia].

[Article in Japanese]

Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder that occurs due to quantitative and 
functional abnormalities of FVIII or FIX. It has a long history, dating as far 
back as the Babylonian era, with many high profile reports, including the 
British royal family and the last prince of the Romanov dynasty. The treatment 
used to be blood transfusion, consisting of plasma derived products from the 
1970s onwards and recombinant products introduced later in the 1990s. In the 
2000s, due to various modifications of factor protein, extended half-life (EHL) 
products have appeared and replaced conventional products. In EHL research, new 
products are also being developed that further the extension of the half-life 
and are more convenient. In 2018, an antibody-based medicine arrived, exhibiting 
a mechanism different from factor replacement therapy. Some other therapeutic 
agents used to suppress bleeding, called nonfactor agents, are currently under 
development. Recently, gene therapy has finally come into the clinical trial 
space in Japan and can be expected to be a treatment which aims at "cure," as it 
can be used with no exposure to bleedings for several years with one injection. 
This article outlines the future of hemophilia treatment.

N-acetylcysteine for Management of Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome.

Schauble AL, Bisaccia EK, Lee G, Nasr SZ.

With the improving life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients, new 
manifestations of the disease are emerging. Distal intestinal obstruction 
syndrome is one of the increasingly noted complications. Traditionally this 
syndrome was treated surgically. N-acetylcysteine is sometimes used as a 
non-surgical treatment option despite lack of definitive evidence for its 
efficacy and safety and not being mentioned in current treatment guidelines. The 
existing case reports suggest that N-acetylcysteine may have a place in therapy 
for older patients with incomplete distal intestinal obstruction syndrome to 
relieve the initial obstruction or following disimpaction to ensure clearance of 
remaining ileus and to prevent obstruction recurrence. In younger patients 
(e.g., <3 years of age), efficacy of N-acetylcysteine has been controversial and 
its use has been associated with drug-induced liver injury and hypernatremia. In 
the cases included in this review, 4% N-acetylcysteine was the formulation most 
commonly used. Since higher concentrations have been associated with increased 
adverse effects and mucosal injury, lower concentrations and dosages should be 
used when using N-acetylcysteine until further evidence becomes available. 
Proper administration technique and monitoring parameters are not well defined 
in current literature. Prospective, well-designed clinical trials are lacking 
and would be helpful to better define the role of N-acetylcysteine in distal 
intestinal obstruction syndrome.

Children with Down syndrome have changes in their innate and adaptive immunity, 
which contribute to increased rates of infections, autoimmune diseases, and 
haematological malignancies. While improved care for congenital heart disease 
has decreased mortality and morbidity, complications related to immune-mediated 
diseases continue to limit the life expectancy in Down syndrome. Infectious 
diseases are common and have a significant effect on development, behaviour and 
quality of life. Infection frequency and severity are influenced by various 
anatomical and physiological alterations in addition to immunological changes in 
Down syndrome. Thus, prevention of respiratory tract infections requires a 
multifactorial approach. This could include additional active and/or passive 
immunizations, prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement and ear, 
nose and throat surgical interventions. Autoimmune conditions like coeliac 
disease, type I diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are classically mentioned 
in the context of Down syndrome. However, autoinflammatory conditions are more 
prevalent as well. Screening for autoimmune diseases is required and 
immunosuppression has to be used with caution. Future studies should address 
optimal screening programmes for immune-mediated diseases in individuals with 
Down syndrome, as well as the effect of immune modulation, to further decrease 
morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life of individuals with 
Down syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: Due to the increase in human life expectancy, a higher number of 
individuals are experiencing age-related cognitive impairments. Therefore, it is 
important to investigate the methods to tackle the effects of aging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were divided into the following groups: the 
aging mice (male, 20 months) and young mice (male, 2 months) were pairing-housed 
together in the same cage and lasted for at least one month (Aging-Young). The 
following tests were performed for the mice in different groups: Open ﬁeld test, 
Morris water maze (MWM) test, Contextual fear conditioning test, Novel Object 
Recognition (NOR) test, Pain threshold test, Olfactory 
habituation/dishabituation test, T-maze test, Electrophysiological recordings.
RESULTS: In this study, we housed aging and young mice together, and found that 
the paired housing for one-month improved the learning and memory of the aging 
mice. These mice exhibited better performance on the Morris water maze (MWM) 
test, a longer freezing duration in the contextual fear conditioning test, a 
higher alternation rate in the T-maze test, and an increased preference for 
novel objects in the novel object recognition (NOR) test. The paired housing 
with young mice also improved the impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in aging 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the paired housing with young mice has 
beneficial effects on learning and memory of aging mice. The manipulation of the 
systemic environment may, therefore, provide a new strategy for aging 
rejuvenation.

The majority of adult parasitoid wasps are unable to synthesize lipids and 
therefore face a trade-off between the investment of lipids in eggs or in the 
maintenance of soma. It has been shown that resource allocation should depend on 
body size in parasitoids. Given that smaller females have shorter expected life 
times, they should concentrate their reproductive effort into early life. To 
test this prediction, we investigated the relationship between body size and the 
timing of egg production in parasitoids. We measured body size, lipid reserves, 
and reproductive investment (number of eggs, ovigeny index equivalent [OIE] and 
egg size) at eclosion in five species of Asobara (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) 
originating from different geographic and climatic environments. Our results 
show significant interspecific variation in all these traits. A diagnostic test 
for phylogenetic independence revealed that closely related species did not 
resemble each other more closely than expected by chance for all traits 
measured. Lipid reserves scaled positively with body size both between and 
within species. In agreement with theory, OI correlated negatively with body 
size both between and within species. Total egg area at eclosion correlated 
negatively with lipid reserves both between and within species. This indicates 
the existence of a trade-off between allocation of lipids to current 
reproduction and survival/future reproduction. With the exception of the most 
extreme pro-ovigenic species, A. persimilis, we found that pro-ovigeny was 
compensated for by small egg size. Our results indicate the role of habitats in 
shaping interspecific variation in resource allocation strategies.

Aggregate health and economic burden of herpes zoster in the United States: 
illustrative example of a pain condition.

Our objective was to develop comprehensive national estimates of the total 
burden of herpes zoster (HZ) among U.S. adults, including direct (ie, medical 
costs) and indirect (ie, productivity losses) costs, as well as its psychosocial 
impact (ie, quality of life losses). Using a patient-level microsimulation 
model, we projected health and economic outcomes among U.S. adults aged 18 years 
and older using a 10-year time horizon. We conducted a comprehensive systematic 
literature review to generate parameter values and conducted simulation modeling 
to generate our outcomes, including numbers of cases of uncomplicated HZ, 
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and ocular complications, productivity losses, and 
losses in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We used a societal perspective 
for outcomes; the costing year was 2015. Projected outcomes for an unvaccinated 
population included 1.1 million HZ cases, 114,000 PHN cases, and 43,000 ocular 
complications annually, resulting in approximately 67,000 QALYs lost. HZ and its 
complications would incur costs of $2.4 billion in direct medical costs and 
productivity losses annually. Projected QALY losses were most sensitive to HZ 
and PHN health utility values in the model. Cost estimates were most sensitive 
to the probability of HZ and to the costs per episode of PHN. The national 
burden of direct, indirect, and psychosocial HZ costs is substantial. Our 
results can inform economic analyses for HZ vaccines. Comprehensive, national 
assessments of the total burden of other painful conditions would be very 
informative.
