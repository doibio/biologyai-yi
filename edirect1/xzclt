school work/homework, sleep, daily routine, able to join in activities) and 
duration. The data were modeled using conditional logit with robust standard 
errors to produce utility values for every health state described by the Child 
Health Utility 9D.
RESULTS: The majority of the dimension level coefficients were monotonic, 
leading to a decrease in utility as severity increases. There was, however, 
evidence of some logical inconsistencies, particularly for the school 
work/homework dimension. The value set produced was based on the ordered model 
and ranges from -0.568 for the worst state to 1 for the best state.
CONCLUSION: The valuation of the Child Health Utility 9D using online discrete 
choice experiment with duration with adult members of the Dutch general 
population was feasible and produced a valid model for use in cost utility 
analysis. Normative questions are raised around the valuation of pediatric 
preference-based measures, including the appropriate perspective for imagining 
hypothetical pediatric health states.

Pseudorabies (PR), also known as Aujeszky's disease, is a highly contagious 
disease affecting pigs and a wide range of animals. Pseudorabies is enzootic in 
many countries. In China, it is a priority animal disease for control and 
eradication, however the data on disease frequency in intensive pig farms and 
the information on associated risk factors is inadequate. A cross-sectional 
study of intensive pig farms (≥350 sows) in Shanghai was conducted to determine 
herd-level prevalence of PRV and associated risk factors. Following a two-stage 
random sampling design, a total of 1349 sow serum samples were tested by 
gpI-ELISA from a total of 91 intensive pig farms in Shanghai. A herd was 
classified as positive if at least one PRV test-positive sow was present. 
Information on putative risk/protective factors was collected using 
questionnaires to pig farm owners or veterinarians. A logistic regression model 
was built to identify risk/protective factors for herd positivity. The results 
indicated that the herd-level true prevalence was 67.6% (95% CI：57.0-77.0). In 
the multivariable logistic regression model using backward stepwise procedure, 
two risk factors were found to be significantly associated with herd positivity: 
'Breeding with introduced sows in the last 12 months' (OR = 3.5, 95%CI:1.2, 
10.3) and 'Presence of stray dogs or cats' (OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 1.2, 12.6). The 
multivariable logistic model fitted the data well. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of 
fit test showed χ2 = 10.86 (df = 8, p =  0.21 > 0.05) and the predictability 
(area under the ROC curve) was 0.86. This study suggested that PR was highly 
endemic in intensive pig farms in Shanghai. The risk and protective factors 
identified in this study could be useful to improve the prevention policy of PR 
in Shanghai and other areas of China.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize available tools that can assist clinicians in 
identifying and reducing or stopping (deprescribing) potentially inappropriate 
medications and that specifically consider frailty or limited life expectancy.
DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis.
SETTING: We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL 
from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included 
articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications.
PARTICIPANTS: Frail older persons and older persons with limited life 
expectancy.
MEASUREMENTS: Narrative description of tools.
RESULTS: We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: 
tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, 
tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication 
list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication-specific advice. The complexity 
of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step-wise protocols. The 
development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the 
tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert 
opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in 
very low-quality studies).
CONCLUSION: Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons 
and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at 
various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be 
investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical 
outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:172-180,

BACKGROUND: Highly innovative drugs (HIDs) can be granted 2 to 3 years of 
temporary reimbursement (TR) to provide timely patient access and to collect 
real-world evidence through registries in the Czech Republic. A TR applicant 
does not need to comply with cost-effectiveness (CE) requirements and the 
willingness-to-pay threshold. It is only when mandatory transition to permanent 
reimbursement (PR) status occurs does the drug need to comply with CE and 
willingness-to-pay requirements.
OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate the HID program in the Czech Republic by 
analyzing the pharmacoeconomic results when a drug starts with TR status and 
transitions to PR status.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis of reimbursement decisions of 
HIDs. All drugs approved for TR (valid from January 2008 to January 2018) were 
identified. A description of the HIDs and their pharmacoeconomic results were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty TR drugs were identified. Most (68%) were oncology drugs and 44% 
were orphan drugs. After the expiration of their TR status, 83% were 
successfully transitioned to PR status. Cost-utility analysis was used to 
support CE results in 42% of the TR drugs. The mean incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (cost/quality-adjusted life-year) of drugs that entered 
TR status was €97,868. When the time came for transition to PR status, the mean 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €34,086 (lower by 65%). Net budget 
impact increased by 3% and decreased by 25% in the first and fifth years, 
respectively, after applying for PR.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides better insight into the HID program for 
costly innovative drugs over a 10-year follow-up. A successful transition to PR 
status was observed for most of the HIDs (83%).

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease with pulmonary involvement being 
predominant and often leading to respiratory failure and premature death. 
Non-pulmonary complications related to CF transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) defect are numerous and account for significant morbidity (exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes, CF-related liver disease, chronic sinusitis, 
osteoporosis). Improvement in patients' care led to a continuous increase in 
life expectancy, with a subsequent increase in the number of adult CF patients 
worldwide. Increased life expectancy comes with increased prevalence of 
CF-related comorbidities, but also with new emerging complications directly 
related to ageing (chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular risk factors, 
cancers). CFTR modulators might also contribute to modify the face of CF 
epidemiology and prognosis. Ageing with CF has become a challenge for CF 
patients and caregivers. This review summarizes classic and emerging 
comorbidities in the context of current growth and ageing of the CF population. 
It also addresses potential roles of CFTR modulators.

BACKGROUND: Individual patient data, e.g. from clinical trials, often need to be 
extrapolated or combined with additional evidence when assessing long-term 
impact in cost-effectiveness modeling studies. Different modeling methods can be 
used to represent the complex dynamics of clinical practice; the choice of which 
may impact cost-effectiveness outcomes. We compare the use of a previously 
designed cohort discrete-time state-transition model (DT-STM) with a discrete 
event simulation (DES) model.
METHODS: The original DT-STM was replicated and a DES model developed using 
AnyLogic software. Models were populated using individual patient data of a 
phase III study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, and compared based on 
their evidence structure, internal validity, and cost-effectiveness outcomes. 
The DT-STM used time-dependent transition probabilities, whereas the DES model 
was populated using parametric distributions.
RESULTS: The estimated time-dependent transition probabilities for the DT-STM 
were irregular and more sensitive to single events due to the required small 
cycle length and limited number of event observations, whereas parametric 
distributions resulted in smooth time-to-event curves for the DES model. 
Although the DT-STM and DES model both yielded similar time-to-event curves, the 
DES model represented the trial data more accurately in terms of mean 
health-state durations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
€172,443 and €168,383 per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained for the DT-STM and 
DES model, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DES represents time-to-event data from clinical trials more 
naturally and accurately than DT-STM when few events are observed per time 
cycle. As a consequence, DES is expected to yield a more accurate ICER.

The standard treatment for metastatic cancer is generally a combination of 
chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Since there are few specific 
chemotherapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, systemic 
chemotherapy is widely employed in the hopes of destroying rapidly dividing 
cancer cells before doing irreversible damage to the human body. Because of the 
nature of traditional chemotherapeutics, systemic treatment is associated with 
various side effects, such as nausea, dysphoria, vomiting, and pain, and 
long-term, irreversible damage to major organs, such as the kidney and heart. As 
life expectancy increases, so has the need for reliable cancer therapy that 
spares or prevents damage to functional healthy organs. One method is to 
precisely deliver drugs into specific tumor cells and tissues. Polymers have 
been characterized as favorable systems to deliver drugs with tunable 
pharmacokinetics, circulation times, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. 
Here, various types of polymers, modified as drug delivery systems for targeting 
cancer, and targeting behaviors of polymer-based carriers will be discussed.

Type III glycogen storage disease (GSD-III) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
due to the deficiency of the glycogen debrancher enzyme. 80% of the patients 
have hepatic and muscular involvement (IIIa), compared to 15% with only liver 
involvement (IIIb). As the life expectancy improves in these patients, the 
possible liver complications are better understood.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the available evidence on Radium 223 therapy, an alfa 
particle emitter with specific action on bone metastases, studied on patients 
with castration resistant prostate cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We review the pivotal study ALSYMPCA, that served to get 
the drug approval for this phase of the disease, and the new data obtained from 
its use. We also performed a search of ongoing studies with Radium 223 alone or 
in combination with other molecules.
EVIDENCE SINTHESIS: According to the ALSYMPCA study, Radium 223 significantly 
prolongs the overall survival of patients with castration resistant prostate 
cancer and bone metastases; approximately 3.6 months in comparison with patients 
who received placebo, which turns into a median life expectancy of 14.9 months, 
and a 36-month survival of 46%, associated with a 30% reduction in death risk. 
Overall survival results were consistent both in patients who receive Docetaxel 
previously and those who did not.
RESULTS: for secondary variables support the positive effect of Radium 223 
therapy on symptomatic skeletal events (for example, the use of external beam 
radiotherapy to alleviate pain) and bone markers, confirming its efficacy in 
bone metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Radium 223 is the first treatment directed to bone that has 
demonstrated significant improvement on overall survival. It also prolonged the 
time to the first skeletal event and the median time to PSA increase 
significantly. All this in addition to its manageable adverse effects, lower 
than those appeared in the placebo arm of the pivotal study ALSYMPCA.

PURPOSE: To estimate gains in health utility for two different catheter features 
and a support service related to urinary catheters used for intermittent 
catheterization.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two internet-based time trade-off (TTO) surveys were 
undertaken to value vignettes describing two innovative catheter features and a 
support service. The first TTO survey "Size and Service" included catheters with 
compact design and the availability of a support service for users; the second 
TTO survey "Phthalates" included avoidance of potentially harmful phthalates in 
the material of the catheters. All participants were from the UK; they traded 
health states against a time horizon that matched their total life expectancy. 
Sensitivity analyses were done to estimate the impact of extreme values on 
disutilities.
RESULTS: The participants (n=890) estimated the incremental value of 0.031 (95% 
CI: 0.024-0.039), 0.009 (95% CI: 0.003-0.015), and 0.037 (95% CI: 0.027-0.046), 
respectively, for catheters with compact design, availability of support 
service, and catheters not containing phthalates.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants valued all three improvements in catheter design. To 
capture the impact of such design improvements on quality of life and utilities, 
vignette-based approaches can be a useful supplement to the conventional, 
generic tools.

Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) is an economically important crop widely 
grown in tropical and subtropical regions for sugar and ethanol production. 
However, the large genome size, high ploidy level, interspecific hybridization 
and aneuploidy make sugarcane one of the most complex genomes and have long 
hampered genome research in sugarcane. Modern sugarcane cultivars are derived 
from interspecific hybridization between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum with 
80-90% of the genome from S. officinarum and 10-20% of the genome from S. 
spontaneum. We constructed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries of S. 
officinarum variety LA Purple (2n = 8x = 80) and S. spontaneum haploid clone 
AP85-441 (2n = 4x = 32), and selected and sequenced 97 BAC clones from the two 
Saccharum BAC libraries. A total of 5,847,280 bp sequence from S. officinarum 
and 5,011,570 bp from S. spontaneum were assembled and 749 gene models were 
annotated in these BACs. A relatively higher gene density and lower repeat 
content were observed in S. spontaneum BACs than in S. officinarum BACs. 
Comparative analysis of syntenic regions revealed a high degree of collinearity 
in genic regions between Saccharum and Sorghum bicolor and between S. 
officinarum and S. spontaneum. In the syntenic regions, S. spontaneum showed 
expansion relative to S. officinarum, and both S. officinarum and S. spontaneum 
showed expansion relative to sorghum. Among the 75 full-length LTR 
retrotransposons identified in the Saccharum BACs, none of them are older than 
2.6 mys and no full-length LTR elements are shared between S. officinarum and S. 
spontaneum. In addition, divergence time estimated using a LTR junction marker 
and a syntenic gene shared by 3 S. officinarum and 1 S. spontaneum BACs revealed 
that the S. spontaneum intergenic region was distant to those from the 3 
homologous regions in S. officinarum. Our results suggested that S. officinarum 
and S. spontaneum experienced at least two rounds of independent 
polyploidization in each lineage after their divergence from a common ancestor.

Health expectancy is an essential population health indicator and can be used to 
monitor changes and/or assess differences in population health. This article 
provides a brief overview of health expectancy and the issues to be considered 
in operationalizing and interpreting health expectancy. The article introduces 
the concept of health expectancy, discusses measures used to compute health 
expectancy, and methods of calculation. The discussion of measures relates 
health expectancy to the concept of "health" and clarifies that values of health 
expectancy depend on how "health" is defined. Software available to compute 
health expectancy including IMaCh, SPACE and ELECT are also briefly introduced.

Kiwifruit is known to contain considerable amount of antioxidative phenolics. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory 
and immunomodulatory effects of Actinidia eriantha cv. Bidan and A. deliciosa 
cv. Hayward kiwifruits. The antioxidant capacity of kiwifruit was measured with 
the DPPH, ABTS and ORAC assays, and was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in cv. 
Bidan than in cv. Hayward. The production of proinflammatory cytokines 
interleukin-6, interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-α by peritoneal 
macrophages from male BALB/c mice was significantly (p < 0.05) lower following 
treatment of cv. Bidan extracts than after treatment with lipopolysaccharide 
alone. Cv. Bidan extracts significantly (p < 0.05) increased the proliferation 
of splenocytes stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody and significantly (p < 0.05) 
reduced their interferon-γ secretion. Taken together, these findings suggest 
that cv. Bidan kiwifruit is rich in antioxidants and may be a source of 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents.

Caloric restriction (CR) is an intervention that can increase maximal lifespan 
in organisms, but its application to humans remains challenging. A more feasible 
approach to achieve lifespan extension is to develop CR mimetics that target 
biochemical pathways affected by CR. Recent studies in the engineering and 
structural characterization of polyketide synthases (PKSs) have facilitated 
their use as biocatalysts to produce novel polyketides. Here, we show that by 
establishing a combinatorial biosynthetic route in Escherichia coli and 
exploring the substrate promiscuity of a mutant PKS from alfalfa, 413 potential 
anti-ageing polyketides were biosynthesized. In this approach, novel 
acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) precursors generated by promiscuous acid-CoA ligases were 
utilized by PKS to generate polyketides which were then fed to Caenorhabditis 
elegans to study their potential efficacy in lifespan extension. It was found 
that CR mimetics like resveratrol can counter the age-associated decline in 
mitochondrial function and increase the lifespan of C. elegans. Using the 
mitochondrial respiration profile of C. elegans supplemented for 8 days with 50 
μM resveratrol as a blueprint, we can screen our novel polyketides for potential 
CR mimetics with improved potency. This study highlights the utility of 
synthetic enzymology in the development of novel anti-ageing therapeutics.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-utility of gefitinib and afatinib as first-line 
EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer treatments from the Chinese healthcare 
system perspective.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A Markov model was established, state transition 
probabilities were extracted from the LUX-Lung7 trial and utility values were 
from previous studies. The cost was extracted from local charge or relevant 
literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for 
intention-to-treat, EGFR exon 19 deletion (del19) and exon Leu858Arg (21L858R, 
L858R) muation subgroups.  Results: For the entire population, the afatinib 
regimen afforded additional 0.29 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US$9820.41/QALY, US$18,529.65/QALY 
and US$1585.51/QALY for intention-to-treat, L858R and del19, respectively.
CONCLUSION: First-line afatinib was more cost-effective than gefitinib for 
EFGR-mutated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in China.

Alzheimer disease is a neurologic disorder characterized by the progressive 
cognitive decline. As the population continues to age, orthopaedic surgeons need 
to become familiar with surgical and nonsurgical treatment considerations in 
this complex population. Despite the advances in geriatric and dementia care, 
surgical and postoperative management of both elective and emergent surgery 
remain complex and controversial in this patient population. Appropriate 
perioperative and postoperative management can optimize outcomes, and the 
management can significantly affect the quality of life of patient and caregiver 
and limit disease burden. Any treatment decision should be guided first and 
foremost by the goals of care as agreed between the surgeon, other providers, 
and family. Surgical management must be demand matched to the patient accounting 
for the severity of disease, life expectancy, and the social support system. The 
authors conducted a literature review of Alzheimer dementia care in orthopaedic 
patients via a Pubmed search of relevant articles published since 1980.

Levels of isoflavones, biomarkers of soy intake, in 24-hour urine (24U) were 
inversely related to coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the World Health 
Organization's Cardiovascular Disease and Alimentary Comparison Study. 
Considering 24 U isoflavone levels were highest and CHD mortality was lowest in 
the Japanese, who maintained the world's longest life expectancy, the 
association of regular soy intake with cardiometabolic risk was investigated in 
Japanese adults (20-49 years old) and elderly (50-79 years old). In multivariate 
analysis adjusted for age, sex, and drug treatments, mean 24 U isoflavone 
excretion was significantly inversely associated with insulin resistance in the 
elderly and significantly associated with blood folate and potassium in the 
elderly, but also positively associated with 24 U salt in the elderly. These 
findings indicate that low-salt soy should be recommended to improve glucose 
metabolism in elderly Japanese.

BACKGROUND: In primary and secondary care medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) 
or functional somatic syndromes (FSS) constitute a major burden for patients and 
society with high healthcare costs and societal costs. Objectives were to 
provide an overview of the evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions for MUS or FSS, and to assess the quality of these studies.
METHODS: We searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, the National Health Service 
Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED) and the CEA registry to conduct a 
systematic review. Articles with full economic evaluations on interventions 
focusing on adult patients with undifferentiated MUS or fibromyalgia (FM), 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), with no 
restrictions on comparators, published until 15 June 2018, were included. We 
excluded preventive interventions. Two reviewers independently extracted study 
characteristics and cost-effectiveness data and used the Consensus on Health 
Economic Criteria Checklist to appraise the methodological quality.
RESULTS: A total of 39 studies out of 1,613 articles met the inclusion criteria. 
Twenty-two studies reported costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 
and cost-utility analyses (CUAs). In 13 CUAs the intervention conditions 
dominated the control conditions or had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
below the willingness-to-pay threshold of € 50,000 per QALY, meaning that the 
interventions were (on average) cost-effective in comparison with the control 
condition. Group interventions focusing on MUS (n = 3) or FM (n = 4) might be 
more cost-effective than individual interventions. The included studies were 
heterogeneous with regard to the included patients, interventions, study design, 
and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of 39 included studies of 
interventions for patients with MUS and FSS and the methodological quality of 
these studies. Considering the limited comparability due to the heterogeneity of 
the studies, group interventions might be more cost-effective than individual 
interventions.
REGISTRATION: Study methods were documented in an international prospective 
register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) protocol, registration number: 
CRD42017060424.

Background - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health threat worldwide 
as it brings about poorer outcomes and places economic burdens to society. This 
study aims to estimate the economic burdens from nosocomial infections (NI) 
caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in Thailand. Research design and 
methods - A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital over 
2011-2012. A multivariate log-linear regression model was used to estimate the 
excess treatment costs of AMR to those non-AMR patients. Results - Switching 
from a non-AMR case to an AMR infection case, resulted in 42% increase in 
expected average treatment costs per patient. The annual treatment from hospital 
perspective and antibiotic costs associated with the management of AMR 
infections were estimated to be US$ 2.3 billion and US$ 262 million, 
respectively. The estimated annual benefit from eradicating AMR NI were US$ 
4.2 billion from a societal perspective with the annual gains in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.6 million due to the absence of 111,295 
AMR cases each year. Conclusions - Large amount of money was spent on treatment 
and antibiotic costs to manage AMR infections. Benefit of eliminating these 
infections was estimated and it would be highly cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: We seek to identify conditions under which a plan by the Toronto 
District School Board (TDSB) to equip high schools with naloxone kits would be 
cost-effective.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the costs, benefits, 
and cost-effectiveness of a school-based naloxone program. We estimated model 
inputs from the medical literature and used Toronto-specific sources whenever 
available. We present our results varying both the expected total number of 
opioid overdoses per year across all 112 TDSB high schools and the effectiveness 
of a school-based naloxone program in reducing mortality.
RESULTS: A school naloxone program likely costs less than CAD$50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained if the overdose frequency is at least once 
each year and it reduces opioid poisoning mortality by at least 40% (from 10% to 
<6.0%) or if the overdose frequency is at least two per year and the program 
reduces mortality by at least 20% (from 10% to <8.0%). The results are sensitive 
to the intensity and cost of staff training, the lifetime costs and 
life-expectancy of overdose survivors, and the probability of an overdose being 
fatal in the absence of a school naloxone program.
CONCLUSIONS: School naloxone programs are relatively inexpensive, but that does 
not ensure that they are a cost-effective use of resources. While potentially 
cost-effective, if the risk of an overdose in a Toronto high school is low, then 
other programs aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of students may be 
better use of limited resources.

BACKGROUND: Throughout history, menopause has been regarded as a transition in a 
woman's life. With the increase in life expectancy, women now spend more than a 
third of their lives in menopause. During these years, women may experience 
intolerable symptoms both physically and mentally, leading them to seek clinical 
advice. It is imperative for healthcare providers to improve the quality of life 
by reducing bothersome menopausal symptoms and preventing disorders such as 
osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. The current treatment in the form of hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) is sometimes inadequate with several limitations and 
adverse effects. Objective and rationale: The current review aims to discuss the 
need, efficacy, and limitations of current HRT; the role of other ovarian 
hormones, and where we stand in comparison with ovary-in situ; and finally, 
explore towards the preparation of an HRT model by regeneration of ovaries 
tissues through stem cells which can replicate a functional ovary.
SEARCH METHODS: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and 
CINAHL) were searched from database inception until 26 April 2018, using a 
combination of relevant controlled vocabulary terms and free-text terms related 
to 'menopause', 'hormone replacement therapy', 'ovary regeneration', 'stem 
cells' and 'ovarian transplantation'.
OUTCOMES: We present a synthesis of the existing data on the efficacy and 
limitations of HRT. HRT is far from adequate in postmenopausal women with 
symptoms of hormone deprivation as it fails to deliver all hormones secreted by 
naïve ovarian tissue. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of synthetic hormones makes 
them substantially different from natural ones. Not only does the number and 
type of hormones given in HRT matter, but the route of delivering and their 
release in circulation are also imperative. The hormones are delivered either 
orally or topically in a non-physiological uniform manner, which brings along 
with it several side effects. These identify the need for a hormone delivery 
system which replicates, integrates and reacts as per the requirement of the 
female body. Wider implications: The review outlines the strengths and 
weaknesses of HRT and highlights the potential areas for future research. There 
is a tremendous potential for research in this field to understand the 
collective roles of the various ovarian hormones and to devise an auto-regulated 
hormone delivery system which replicates the normal physiology. Its clinical 
applications can prove to be transformative for postmenopausal women helping 
them to lead a healthy and productive life.

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits have a great influence on physiological health. Even 
though this fact is generally recognized, people do not eat as healthily as they 
know they should. The factors that support a healthy diet, on the other hand, 
are not well known. It is supposed that there is a link between personal traits 
and dietary habits. Personal traits may also partially explain why some people 
manage to make healthy dietary changes while some fail to do so or are not able 
to try to make changes even when they desire to do so. There is some information 
suggesting that dispositional optimism plays a role in succeeding in improving 
dietary habits. The aim of this study was to determine the role of optimism and 
pessimism in the process of dietary changes.
METHODS: Dispositional optimism and pessimism were determined using the revised 
Life Orientation Test in 2815 individuals (aged 52-76 years) participating in 
the GOAL study in the region of Lahti, Finland. The dietary habits of the study 
subjects were analysed. After 3 years, the subjects' dietary habits and their 
possible improvements were registered. The associations between dispositional 
optimism and pessimism, dietary habits at baseline, and possible changes in 
dietary habits during the follow-up were studied with logistic regression. We 
also studied if the dietary habits or certain lifestyle factors (e.g. physical 
exercising and smoking) at baseline predicted success in improving the diet.
RESULTS: Pessimism seemed to correlate clearly negatively with the healthiness 
of the dietary habits at baseline - i.e. the higher the level of pessimism, the 
unhealthier the diet. Optimism also showed a correlation with dietary habits at 
baseline, although to a lesser extent. Those who managed to improve their 
dietary habits during follow-up or regarded their dietary habits as healthy 
enough even without a change were less pessimistic at baseline than those who 
failed in their attempts to improve their diet or did not even try, even when 
they recognized the need for a change.
CONCLUSIONS: Pessimistic people are more likely to eat an unhealthy diet than 
others. Pessimism reduces independently the possibilities to improve dietary 
patterns.
