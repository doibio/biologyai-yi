burden of disease according to the annual number of lung cancer deaths prevented 
and the associated period gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the 
2012 populations in Canada from reductions in residential radon exposures.
INTERVENTIONS: Two postulated interventions for residential radon mitigation in 
new construction are assessed, corresponding to a 50% reduction and an 85% 
reduction in radon nationally, in the provinces/territories, and in 17 census 
metropolitan areas in Canada.
METHODS: Data were derived from two recent Canadian radon surveys conducted by 
the Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, along with Canadian mortality 
and quality of life data. Analyses adopted a lifetime horizon and a discount 
rate of 1.5%. A period life-table analysis was conducted using age- and 
sex-specific all-cause and lung cancer mortality rates, adjusted for smoking, 
and the BEIR VI exposure-age-concentration model for radon-attributable risk of 
lung cancer mortality.
RESULTS: A reduction in residential radon by 50% could prevent 681 lung cancer 
deaths, associated with a gain of 15,445 QALYs in the Canadian population at a 
discount rate of 1.5%; a reduction in radon by 85% could prevent 1263 lung 
cancer deaths, associated with a gain of 26,336 QALYs. On a per population 
basis, the Yukon was estimated to benefit most from radon mitigation.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of QALY gains in Canada estimated under the two radon 
mitigation scenarios is appreciable but varies considerably across provinces due 
to variability in indoor radon concentrations and smoking rates.

OBJECTIF: Cette analyse a pour objectif d’estimer la charge modifiable des 
maladies en tant que le nombre évitable de décès de cancer du poumon attribué au 
radon et l’accroissement des années de vie ajustées sur la qualité (AVAQ, que 
l’anglais appelle QALY) à la suite des réductions potentielles de l’exposition 
au radon subie par la population du Canada en 2012.
INTERVENTIONS: Les effets de deux interventions qui pourraient être intégrées 
dans la construction de tous nouveaux logements pour réduire l’exposition au 
radon domestique, qui correspondraient à des réductions de 50 % et de 85 %, sont 
estimés pour la population du Canada, de chaque province et territoire, et de 17 
régions métropolitaines de recensement.
MÉTHODE: Les données relevées par deux enquêtes récentes mesurant la 
concentration de radon domestique menées par le Bureau de la protection contre 
les rayonnements des produits cliniques et de consommation de Santé Canada, 
ainsi que les données pour le taux de mortalité et la qualité de vie selon le 
groupe d’âge et le sexe fournies par Statistique Canada. L’analyse adopte 
l’horizon temporal de la vie entière et la valeur des années futures est 
actualisée à un taux de 1,5 %. L’analyse des tables de survie par période repose 
sur les tables de mortalité toutes causes et du cancer du poumon selon le sexe 
et le groupe d’âge, portant sur les fumeurs, les non-fumeurs et agrégées, et le 
modèle âge-période-concentration proposé par le BEIR VI pour le risque de 
mortalité par cancer de poumon attribuable au radon.
RÉSULTATS: 681 décès par cancer du poumon pourraient être évités par une 
réduction de radon domestique de 50 %, ce qui entraîne un accroissement de 15 
445 AVAQ pour la population du Canada à un taux de 1,5 % pour la valeur des 
années futures; 1263 décès par cancer du poumon pourraient être évités par une 
réduction de radon domestique de 85 %, ce qui entraîne un accroissement de 26 
336 AVAQ. La réduction de radon domestique fournit les meilleurs avantages par 
habitant pour le Yukon.
CONCLUSION: L’ampleur des gains en AVAQ à la suite des réductions potentielles 
de l’exposition au radon domestique pour la population du Canada est. 
appréciable, et montre une variation considérable parmi les provinces et les 
régions métropolitaines de recensement, selon la distribution de radon 
domestique et le taux de tabagisme.

The increasing life expectancy at birth and the improvement of general health 
observed worldwide over the previous years are likely due to many factors. In 
this regard, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
has highlighted the favourable situation of the Italian population, which is 
amongst the most privileged in the world. In Italy, the national healthcare 
system is easily accessible to the whole population without direct costs, and 
alcohol abuse and cigarette smoke are less widespread compared to neighbouring 
countries. Moreover, the population still largely follows a dietary pattern 
characterised by the consumption of foods rich in protective compounds (plant 
foods and their components, such as fibre, polyphenols and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids). According to recent data, a significant consumption of these foods, 
which are key components of the Mediterranean model, is likely to play a more 
important role compared to the limited consumption of nutrients considered less 
favourable (essentially, saturated fat and sugar). Based on these assumptions, 
it can be inferred that the adoption of coercive legislative interventions-which 
have been introduced in other western countries to improve diet quality-may not 
be an optimal strategy in a country like Italy. Such an intervention would 
contend with psychological and social aspects (namely with the belief that 
participating in decision-making is an essential right) and with broader 
indications emerging in the research within this field (the effectiveness of a 
nudge approach as opposed to constraining interventions). These factors may 
limit any expected positive impact on health within this context. LEVEL OF 
EVIDENCE: Level V, narrative review.

Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributes to more than 50 per cent disability 
adjusted life years (DALYs) in India; and tobacco contributes to 7·4 per cent of 
DALYs which is next to diet and high blood pressure. According to Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) 2015, tobacco use contributed to 5.9 per cent out of total 
DALYs in India. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) consumption is a multifactorial process 
influenced by varied range of contextual factors i.e., social, environmental, 
psychological and the genetic factors which are linked to the tobacco use. The 
determinants associated with the SLT use are gender, educational level, wealth 
index (inverse association), urban-rural residence, socio-economic status and 
low tax. Taking the view from tobacco control programmes, there is a need to 
address determinants of SLT use with State level monitoring and socio-economic 
inequalities, progress and review of the taxation of the SLT use in India.

Eliglustat is a first-line oral therapy for adults with Gaucher disease type 1 
(GD1) and poor, intermediate or extensive CYP2D6-metabolizer phenotypes (>90% of 
patients). We report the final results of a Phase 2 trial and extension 
(NCT00358150) in previously untreated adult GD1 patients who had splenomegaly 
with thrombocytopenia and/or anemia and received 50 or 100 mg eliglustat 
tartrate (equivalent to 42 or 84 mg eliglustat) twice daily for 8 years. In 
total, 19 of 26 patients completed the trial. After 8 years of eliglustat, mean 
spleen and liver volumes decreased by 69% and 34%, respectively. Mean hemoglobin 
concentration and platelet count increased by 2.2 g/dL and 113%, respectively. 
All patients met at least 3 of 4 therapeutic goals established for patients on 
long-term enzyme replacement therapy. Mean final values for patients with severe 
splenomegaly (n = 6), moderate-to-severe anemia (n = 6), or severe 
thrombocytopenia (n = 8) were similar to patients with milder disease at 
baseline and within long-term therapeutic goal thresholds. Biomarker median 
percent changes from baseline were -91% for chitotriosidase, -87% for CCL18, 
-92% for glucosylsphingosine, and -80% for plasma glucosylceramide. Mean lumbar 
spine T-score increased by 0.96, moving from the osteopenic to the normal range. 
Mean quality-of-life scores, mostly below normal at baseline, moved into ranges 
seen in healthy adults. Eliglustat was well-tolerated; 98% of adverse events 
were mild or moderate and 94% were considered unrelated to treatment. Clinically 
meaningful improvements in all parameters continued or were maintained over 8 
years, with the largest margins of improvement seen in the most severely 
affected patients.

BACKGROUND: Depression is the most prevalent mental health problem among people 
with learning disabilities.
OBJECTIVE: The trial investigated the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of behavioural activation for depression experienced by 
people with mild to moderate learning disabilities. The intervention was 
compared with a guided self-help intervention.
DESIGN: A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, with follow-up 
at 4, 8 and 12 months post randomisation. There was a nested qualitative study.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from community learning disability teams 
and services and from Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in 
Scotland, England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were aged ≥ 18 years, with clinically significant 
depression, assessed using the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for 
use with Adults with Learning Disabilities. Participants had to be able to give 
informed consent and a supporter could accompany them to therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: BeatIt was a manualised behavioural activation intervention, 
adapted for people with learning disabilities and depression. StepUp was an 
adapted guided self-help intervention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the Glasgow Depression 
Scale for people with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD). Secondary outcomes 
included carer ratings of depressive symptoms and aggressiveness, self-reporting 
of anxiety symptoms, social support, activity and adaptive behaviour, 
relationships, quality of life (QoL) and life events, and resource and 
medication use.
RESULTS: There were 161 participants randomised (BeatIt, n = 84; StepUp, 
n = 77). Participant retention was strong, with 141 completing the trial. Most 
completed therapy (BeatIt: 86%; StepUp: 82%). At baseline, 63% of BeatIt 
participants and 66% of StepUp participants were prescribed antidepressants. 
There was no statistically significant difference in GDS-LD scores between the 
StepUp (12.94 points) and BeatIt (11.91 points) groups at the 12-month primary 
outcome point. However, both groups improved during the trial. Other 
psychological and QoL outcomes followed a similar pattern. There were no 
treatment group differences, but there was improvement in both groups. There was 
no economic evidence suggesting that BeatIt may be more cost-effective than 
StepUp. However, treatment costs for both groups were approximately only 4-6.5% 
of the total support costs. Results of the qualitative research with 
participants, supporters and therapists were in concert with the quantitative 
findings. Both treatments were perceived as active interventions and were valued 
in terms of their structure, content and perceived impact.
LIMITATIONS: A significant limitation was the absence of a treatment-as-usual 
(TAU) comparison.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary outcomes, economic data and qualitative 
results all clearly demonstrate that there was no evidence for BeatIt being more 
effective than StepUp.
FUTURE WORK: Comparisons against TAU are required to determine whether or not 
these interventions had any effect.

treatment in the management of space-occupying brain oedema post middle cerebral 
artery infarction.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data from randomly controlled trials have indicated that 
a decompressive hemicraniectomy is more clinically effective than medical 
treatment in the management of space-occupying brain oedema post middle cerebral 
artery infarction. This economic evaluation compares the impact of the two 
options in the UK. No recent study has conducted an economic evaluation on this 
topic for the UK.
METHOD: A cost-utility analysis over a time period of 1 year was used, measuring 
benefits in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in pound 
sterling, discounted to 2015 prices. The evaluation was from the perspective of 
the National Health Service, the largest healthcare provider in the UK.
RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis found an incremental cost effectiveness of 
£116 595.10 for every QALY gained if patients were offered a decompressive 
hemicraniectomy compared to the best medical treatment.
DISCUSSION: This is above the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) 'cost-effective' threshold of £20 000-£30 000 per QALY, but lower 
mortality rates associated with the surgical alternative raises ethical 
considerations for healthcare providers in the UK.

Cost-Effectiveness of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Nonoperative Management in 
Normal, Overweight, Obese, Severely Obese, Morbidly Obese, and Super Obese 
Patients: A Markov Model.

BACKGROUND: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of performing total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) vs nonoperative management (NM) among 6 body mass index (BMI) 
cohorts.
METHODS: We constructed a state-transition Markov model to compare the cost 
utility of THA and NM in the 6 BMI groups over a 15-year period. Model 
parameters for transition probability (risk of revision, re-revision, and 
death), utility, and costs (inflation adjusted to 2017 US dollars) were 
estimated from the literature. Direct medical costs of managing hip arthritis 
were accounted in the model. Indirect societal costs were not included. A 3% 
annual discount rate was used for costs and utilities. The primary outcome was 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of THA vs NM. One-way and Monte 
Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were performed 
to determine the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Over the 15-year time period, the ICERs for THA vs NM were the 
following: normal weight ($6043/QALYs [quality-adjusted life years]), overweight 
($5770/QALYs), obese ($5425/QALYs), severely obese ($7382/QALYs), morbidly obese 
($8338/QALYs), and super obese ($16,651/QALYs). The 2 highest BMI groups had 
higher incremental QALYs and incremental costs. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis suggests that THA would be cost-effective in 100% of the normal, 
overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese simulations, and 99.95% of 
super obese simulations at an ICER threshold of $50,000/QALYs.
CONCLUSION: Even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALYs, which is 
considered low for the United States, our model showed that THA would be 
cost-effective for all obesity levels. BMI cut-offs for THA may lead to 
unnecessary loss of healthcare access.

INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological data concerning benign prostatic hyperplasia are 
numerous but highly variable depending on the definition of the pathology that 
is selected and on the source of information used. The objective of this work 
was to present an inventory of the main epidemiological data available in France 
and worldwide.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A literature review was conducted from the Pubmed database 
between 1990 and 2018. The MeshTerm "benign prostatic hyperplasia", 
"epidemiology", "prevalence", and "incidence" were used to identify key articles 
of interest. These references were analyzed on the basis of the titles and 
summaries and cross-referenced with the cited references. The main articles 
selected were discussed by the authors before being summarized in this work.
RESULTS: The relationship between BPH, LUTS, OSV and increased prostate volume 
is difficult to establish. In the context of epidemiological studies, these 
difficulties have a major impact on the accuracy of the results that are 
proposed. Nevertheless, we see that global demographics and increased life 
expectancy are leading to a steady increase in the prevalence of this disease. 
The corresponding health expenditure is also increasing, but more rapidly, 
posing major public health issues. The analysis of national health system 
databases confirms the steady and significant increase in the number of patients 
medically treated while the number of operated patients remains stable for 
several years.
CONCLUSION: The number of patients treated for BPH-related LUTS is steadily 
increasing. The related health expenditures increase exponentially while their 
efficiency remains poorly assessed from a medico-economic point of view. Given 
the frequency of this pathology and the resulting financial stakes, improving 
the quality of life and preventing complications must remain the main objectives 
of the medical care offered to patients.

BACKGROUND: Human capital is recognised as the level of education and health in 
a population and is considered an important determinant of economic growth. The 
World Bank has called for measurement and annual reporting of human capital to 
track and motivate investments in health and education and enhance productivity. 
We aim to provide a new comprehensive measure of human capital across countries 
globally.
METHODS: We generated a period measure of expected human capital, defined for 
each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and 
adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and 
functional health status using rates specific to each time period, age, and sex 
for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. We estimated educational attainment using 
2522 censuses and household surveys; we based learning estimates on 1894 tests 
among school-aged children; and we based functional health status on the 
prevalence of seven health conditions, which were taken from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016). Mortality rates 
specific to location, age, and sex were also taken from GBD 2016.
FINDINGS: In 2016, Finland had the highest level of expected human capital of 
28·4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 
20 and 64 years (95% uncertainty interval 27·5-29·2); Niger had the lowest 
expected human capital of less than 1·6 years (0·98-2·6). In 2016, 44 countries 
had already achieved more than 20 years of expected human capital; 68 countries 
had expected human capital of less than 10 years. Of 195 countries, the ten most 
populous countries in 2016 for expected human capital were ranked: China at 44, 
India at 158, USA at 27, Indonesia at 131, Brazil at 71, Pakistan at 164, 
Nigeria at 171, Bangladesh at 161, Russia at 49, and Mexico at 104. Assessment 
of change in expected human capital from 1990 to 2016 shows marked variation 
from less than 2 years of progress in 18 countries to more than 5 years of 
progress in 35 countries. Larger improvements in expected human capital appear 
to be associated with faster economic growth. The top quartile of countries in 
terms of absolute change in human capital from 1990 to 2016 had a median 
annualised growth in gross domestic product of 2·60% (IQR 1·85-3·69) compared 
with 1·45% (0·18-2·19) for countries in the bottom quartile.
INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in the rate of human capital formation. 
Monitoring the production of human capital can facilitate a mechanism to hold 
governments and donors accountable for investments in health and education.

Lonicera japonica (LJ) is widely used as the local medicine to improve body and 
prevent ills in China, but mechanisms of its healthy beneficial effects remain 
largely unclear. Here, we evaluated the anti-aging and healthspan promoting 
activities of 75% ethanol extract of LJ (LJ-E) in the animal model 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results showed that LJ-E (500 μg/mL) treatment 
enhanced the mean lifespan of worms by over 21.87% and significantly improved 
age-associated physiological functions in C. elegans. The 500 μg/mL 
concentration of LJ-E enhanced the survival rates under oxidative and thermal 
stresses, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and fat 
accumulation in the worms. Gene-specific mutant studies showed that 
LJ-E-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on mev-1, daf-2, daf-16, and 
hsf-1, but not eat-2 genes. LJ-E could upregulate stress-inducible genes, viz., 
hsp-16.2, sod-3 and mtl-1. Moreover, we found that the D1086.10 protein 
interacted with superoxide dismutase (SOD)-3 by functional protein association 
networks analysis according to RNA-sequencing results. It was confirmed that 
D1086.10 was needed to promote longevity, and positively regulated expression of 
sod-3 by using D1086.10 mutants. Furthermore, LJ-E significantly delayed amyloid 
β-protein induced paralysis in CL4176 strain. Given the important role of 
autophagy in aging and protein homeostasis, we observed that LJ-E could 
remarkably increase the mRNA expression of autophagy gene bec-1 in CL4176 
strain, and decrease expression of autophagy substrate p62 protein by more than 
40.0% in BC12921 strain. Finally, we found that combination composed of three 
major compounds (54 μg/mL chlorogenic acid, 15 μg/mL 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid 
and 7.5 μg/mL 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid) of 500 μg/mL LJ-E could significantly 
delay paralysis in CL4176 worms caused by Aβ toxicity, comparable to that of 
LJ-E. Overall, our study may have important implications in using Lonicera 
japonica to promote healthy aging and have a potency to design therapeutics for 
age-related diseases.

Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent human vector-borne viral disease. The 
force of infection (FoI), the rate at which susceptible individuals are infected 
in a population, is an important metric for infectious disease modeling. 
Understanding how and why the FoI of DENV changes over time is critical for 
developing immunization and vector control policies. We used age-stratified 
seroprevalence data from 12 years of the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in 
Nicaragua to estimate the annual FoI of DENV from 1994 to 2015. Seroprevalence 
data revealed a change in the rate at which children acquire DENV-specific 
immunity: in 2004, 50% of children age >4 years were seropositive, but by 2015, 
50% seropositivity was reached only by age 11 years. We estimated a spike in the 
FoI in 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 and a gradual decline thereafter, and children 
age <4 years experienced a lower FoI. Two hypotheses to explain the change in 
the FoI were tested: (i) a transition from introduction of specific DENV 
serotypes to their endemic transmission and (ii) a population demographic 
transition due to declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy. We used 
mathematical models to simulate these hypotheses. We show that the initial high 
FoI can be explained by the introduction of DENV-3 in 1994-1998, and that the 
overall gradual decline in the FoI can be attributed to demographic shifts. 
Changes in immunity and demographics strongly impacted DENV transmission in 
Nicaragua. Population-level measures of transmission intensity are dynamic and 
thus challenging to use to guide vaccine implementation locally and globally.

Psychiatry today is mainly practised within a curative framework. However, many 
mental disorders are persistent and negatively affect quality of life as well as 
life expectancy. This tension between treatment goals and the actual illness 
trajectory has evoked a growing academic interest in 'palliative psychiatry', 
namely the application of a palliative care approach in patients with severe 
persistent mental illness. Recently, Trachsel et al presented a working 
definition of palliative psychiatry. This first official attempt to capture the 
concept is based on WHO's widely accepted definition of palliative care but 
modified and limited to include only severe persistent psychiatric illness. 
While this is a welcome step in the discussion on palliative care approaches in 
psychiatry, it also opens up for new questions. One of the most evident is 
whether psychiatry actually needs its own definition of palliative care or, put 
differently, whether there is something about mental disorders that differs so 
radically from other medical conditions that it calls for a separate definition. 
We acknowledge the need to discuss the goals of psychiatric care in patients 
with severe persistent psychiatric illness. However, we question whether a 
separate definition of palliative care exclusive to psychiatry is the right way 
to go. In this paper, we discuss why.

Osteosarcoma is a type of bone tumour characterized by considerable levels of 
phenotypic heterogeneity, aneuploidy, and a high mutational rate. The life 
expectancy of osteosarcoma patients has not changed during the last three 
decades and thus much remains to be learned about the disease biology. Here, we 
employ a RGB-based single-cell tracking system to study the clonal dynamics 
occurring in a de novo-induced murine osteosarcoma model. We show that 
osteosarcoma cells present initial polyclonal dynamics, followed by clonal 
dominance associated with adaptation to the microenvironment. Interestingly, the 
dominant clones are composed of subclones with a similar tumour generation 
potential when they are re-implanted in mice. Moreover, individual spontaneous 
metastases are clonal or oligoclonal, but they have a different cellular origin 
than the dominant clones present in primary tumours. In summary, we present 
evidence that osteosarcomagenesis can follow a neutral evolution model, in which 
different cancer clones coexist and propagate simultaneously.

Hepatectomy of large hepatocellular carcinomas (>10 cm) in over 70 year-old 
patients is presumed futile. We retrospectively reviewed 5970 patients with 
liver tumors Jan 2010 through Dec 2016 in our institute, of them, 37 older 
patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas staged I-III and Child-Pugh A 
liver functions receiving conservative treatments (conservative group, n = 37) 
and 16 older patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas staged I- III who 
underwent partial hepatectomy (resection group, n = 16) were included, the risk 
factors for poor survival were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. 
Compared with the conservative treatments, Partial hepatectomy achieved better 
median survival time (25.5 months versus 11 months, log-rank = 0.0001) and 
better median performance status (1 versus 3, p = 0.023), there was different in 
Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.019). For the conservative group, the 3-month, 
1, 2, 3-year survival rate was 78.4%, 43.2%, 5.4%, 0%; for the resection group, 
The 3-month, 1, 2, 3-year survival rate was 100%, 93.7.2%, 56.3%, 12.5%; 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed the Charlson comorbidity index and 
the performance status associated with poor outcomes of those patients 
(p = 0.001, 0.018, respectively). Resections of large hepatocellular carcinomas 
in older patients can be performed safely to prolong life expectancy and improve 
life quality with or without cancer recurrence.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of new targeted therapies in kidney 
cancer has shaped disease management in the metastatic phase. Our study aims to 
conduct a cost-utility analysis of sunitinib versus pazopanib in first-line 
setting in Canada for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients using 
real-world data.
METHODS: A Markov model with Monte-Carlo microsimulations was developed to 
estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of patients treated in first-line 
with sunitinib versus pazopanib. Transition probabilities were estimated using 
observational data from a Canadian database where real-life clinical practice 
was captured. The costs of therapies, disease progression, and management of 
adverse events were included in the model in Canadian dollars ($Can). Utility 
and disutility values were included for each health state. Incremental 
cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were 
calculated for a time horizon of 5 years, from the Canadian Healthcare System 
perspective.
RESULTS: The cost difference was $36,303 and the difference in quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) was 0.54 in favour of sunitinib with an ICUR of $67,227/QALY 
for sunitinib versus pazopanib. The major cost component (56%) is related to 
best supportive care (BSC) where patients tend to stay for a longer period of 
time compared to other states. The difference in life years gained (LYG) between 
sunitinib and pazopanib was 1.21 LYG (33.51 vs 19.03 months) and the ICER was 
$30,002/LYG. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the model with 
a high probability of sunitinib being a cost-effective option when compared to 
pazopanib.
CONCLUSION: When using real-world evidence, sunitinib is found to be a 
cost-effective treatment compared to pazopanib in mRCC patients in Canada.

PURPOSE: To explore gender inequality in global burden of uncorrected refractive 
error (URE) by year, age, and socioeconomic status using disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs).
DESIGN: International, comparative burden-of-disease study.
METHODS: Global, regional, and national gender-specific DALY numbers; crude DALY 
rates; and age-standardized DALY rates caused by URE, by year and age, were 
extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. Human development index 
(HDI) in 2015 as an indicator of national socioeconomic status was extracted 
from the Human Development Report. Pearson correlation and linear regression 
analyses were conducted to investigate the association between socioeconomic 
status and gender inequality.
RESULTS: Gender inequality in global URE burden has persisted since 1990, 
through 2015, with little improvement over the decades. Age-standardized DALY 
rates were 189.8 among male subjects vs 223.0 among female subjects in 1990 and 
188.4 vs 225.2 in 2015. Female subjects had higher burden than male subjects of 
the same age, and gender inequality increased with age. Female-minus-male 
difference in age-standardized DALY rates (r = -0.562, P < .001; standardized 
β = -0.562, P < .001) and female-to-male age-standardized DALY rate ratios 
(r = -0.258, P < .001; standardized β = -0.258, P < .001) were negatively 
related to HDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequality in global URE burden has persisted over the past 
few decades, with female individuals bearing more burden than male individuals. 
Older age and lower socioeconomic status are related to greater gender 
inequality. These findings highlight the importance of making gender-sensitive 
health policy to manage global vision loss caused by URE.

The effect of a layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic deposition coating of 
alginate and chitosan with grapefruit seed extract was investigated on the shelf 
life of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) stored for 15 days under refrigeration 
(4 °C). The shrimp were periodically analyzed for changes in microbiological 
parameters (total aerobic mesophilic bacteria and total aerobic psychrotrophic 
bacteria counts), chemical parameters, melanosis, and sensory characteristics. 
The chitosan-alginate coating had the advantage of reducing the bacterial count 
by 2 log CFU in combination with the antimicrobial activity of the grapefruit 
seed extract. The bilayer coating reduced the off-flavor of shrimp during the 
storage period by preventing the odor of acetic acid that was used to dissolve 
chitosan. In conclusion, chitosan and chitosan-alginate treatments could prolong 
the shelf life of shrimp.

BACKGROUND: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as a combination treatment for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) 
patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. The objective of this 
study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination 
for the treatment of CF homozygous for F508del CF Transmembrane Conductance 
Regulator (CFTR) mutation.
METHODS: A Markov-state transition model following a cohort of 12 year-old CF 
patients homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation in the United States (US) over 
two, four, six, eight and ten years from a payer's perspective was developed 
using TreeAge Pro 2016. Markov states included: mild (percentage of predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s or FEV1 > 70%), moderate (FEV1 40-70%), severe 
(FEV1 < 40%) disease, post-transplant, and death. Pulmonary exacerbation and 
lung transplant were included as transition states. All the input parameters 
were estimated from the literature. A 1-year cycle length and 3% discount rate 
were applied. To assess uncertainty in long-term treatment effects, several 
scenarios were modelled: 100% long-term effectiveness (base-case), defined as 
improvement in FEV1 in the first year followed by no annual FEV1 decline and a 
constant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations throughout, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% 
(worst case) long-term effectiveness, where treatment effects were intermediate 
from the second year of treatment until the end of the time horizon. Other 
scenarios included changing the starting age of the cohort to 6 and 25 years. 
Primary outcome included incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of 
cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to determine uncertainty.
RESULTS: Under the base-case, Lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in higher QALYs 
(7.29 vs 6.84) but at a very high cost ($1,778,920.88) compared to usual care 
($116,155.76) over a 10-year period. The ICER for base-case and worst-case 
scenarios were $3,655,352 / QALY, and $8,480,265/QALY gained, respectively. In 
the base-case, lumacaftor/ivacaftor was cost-effective at a threshold of 
$150,000/QALY-gained when annual drug costs were lower than $4153. The results 
were not substantially affected by the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention produces large QALY gains but at an extremely high 
cost, resulting in an ICER that would not typically be covered by any insurer. 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor's status as an orphan drug complicates coverage decisions.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity 
and mortality. Bariatric surgery has been shown to significantly reduce both 
morbidity and mortality. Numerous surgical strategies exist, but the most 
frequently used worldwide are adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy 
(SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). It is not clear which of these 
strategies provides the optimal quality-of-life pay-off.
OBJECTIVE: Modeled decision analysis allows comparison of different treatment 
interventions allowing for plausible differences in input variables. This 
facilitates establishment of the optimal intervention under numerous conditions.
SETTING: University Hospital, Ireland.
METHODS: Modeled decision analysis was performed from the patient's perspective 
comparing best medical therapy, adjustable gastric banding, SG, and RYGB. Input 
variables were calculated based on previously published decision analyses and a 
systematic search of obesity-related literature. Utilities were based on 
previously published studies. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed. 
Sensitive variables underwent 3-way analysis.
RESULTS: The optimal treatment strategy in the base case was RYGB with a 
quality-adjusted life-year payoff (QALY) of 1.53 QALYs at 2 years postprocedure. 
Sleeve gastrectomy provided 1.49 QALYs. Medical therapy and adjustable gastric 
banding provided .98 and .96 QALYs, respectively. Rate of complications in RYGB 
and the utility of SG and RYGB proved sensitive. If complication rates are high, 
SG becomes the optimal strategy. Sensitive thresholds were established for the 
utility of SG and RYGB at .804 and .78, respectively.
CONCLUSION: SG and RYGB offer similar outcomes in terms of QALY payoffs. 
Decision making should be in line with institutional and patient preference.
