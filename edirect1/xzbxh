CONCLUSIONS: Selection bias explaining some of the results cannot be excluded. 
However, NFPA patients with GHRT had reduced overall mortality compared with the 
general population, and death due to malignancy was not increased. This suggests 
that long-term GHRT is safe in adult patients selected for treatment.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who present with critical limb 
ischemia (CLI) have become an increasingly common and complex treatment problem 
for vascular surgeons. Dialysis patients have high short-term mortality rates 
regardless of whether revascularization is pursued. ESRD patients with CLI can 
be managed with: local wound care, endovascular or surgical revascularization, 
or amputation. Some patients may heal small foot wounds with local wound care 
alone, even if distal perfusion is marginal, as long as any infectious process 
has been controlled. Surgical revascularization has a mortality rate of 5-10% 
but has a high chance of limb salvage. However, overall 5-year survival may be 
as low as 28%. Endovascular therapy also carries a high perioperative mortality 
risk in this population with similar limb salvage rates. Amputation is indicated 
in patients with advanced stage CLI, as described by the Society for Vascular 
Surgery's Wound, Ischemia and foot Infection (WIfI) system. Statistical models 
predict that endovascular or surgical revascularization strategies are less 
costly and more functionally beneficial to patients than primary amputation 
alone. Decisions on how to manage ESRD patients with CLI are complex but 
revascularization can often result in limb salvage, despite limited overall 
survival. Dialysis patients with good life expectancy and good quality conduit 
may benefit most from surgical bypass.

As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company that manufactures 
cabazitaxel (Jevtana®, Sanofi, UK) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of cabazitaxel for treatment of patients with metastatic 
hormone-relapsed prostate cancer (mHRPC) previously treated with a 
docetaxel-containing regimen. The School of Health and Related Research 
Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to 
act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical 
review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology 
based upon the company's submission to NICE. Clinical evidence for cabazitaxel 
was derived from a multinational randomised open-label phase III trial (TROPIC) 
of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone compared with mitoxantrone plus 
prednisone or prednisolone, which was assumed to represent best supportive care. 
The NICE final scope identified a further three comparators: abiraterone in 
combination with prednisone or prednisolone; enzalutamide; and radium-223 
dichloride for the subgroup of people with bone metastasis only (no visceral 
metastasis). The company did not consider radium-223 dichloride to be a relevant 
comparator. Neither abiraterone nor enzalutamide has been directly compared in a 
trial with cabazitaxel. Instead, clinical evidence was synthesised within a 
network meta-analysis (NMA). Results from TROPIC showed that cabazitaxel was 
associated with a statistically significant improvement in both overall survival 
and progression-free survival compared with mitoxantrone. Results from a 
random-effects NMA, as conducted by the company and updated by the ERG, 
indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the 
three active treatments for both overall survival and progression-free survival. 
Utility data were not collected as part of the TROPIC trial, and were instead 
taken from the company's UK early access programme. Evidence on resource use 
came from the TROPIC trial, supplemented by both expert clinical opinion and a 
UK clinical audit. List prices were used for mitoxantrone, abiraterone and 
enzalutamide as directed by NICE, although commercial in-confidence 
patient-access schemes (PASs) are in place for abiraterone and enzalutamide. The 
confidential PAS was used for cabazitaxel. Sequential use of the advanced 
hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) does not usually occur in 
clinical practice in the UK. Hence, cabazitaxel could be used within two 
pathways of care: either when an advanced hormonal therapy was used 
pre-docetaxel, or when one was used post-docetaxel. The company believed that 
the former pathway was more likely to represent standard National Health Service 
(NHS) practice, and so their main comparison was between cabazitaxel and 
mitoxantrone, with effectiveness data from the TROPIC trial. Results of the 
company's updated cost-effectiveness analysis estimated a probabilistic 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £45,982 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, which the committee considered to be the most plausible 
value for this comparison. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be both cheaper and more 
effective than abiraterone. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be cheaper but less 
effective than enzalutamide, resulting in an ICER of £212,038 per QALY gained 
for enzalutamide compared with cabazitaxel. The ERG noted that radium-223 is a 
valid comparator (for the indicated sub-group), and that it may be used in 
either of the two care pathways. Hence, its exclusion leads to uncertainty in 
the cost-effectiveness results. In addition, the company assumed that there 
would be no drug wastage when cabazitaxel was used, with cost-effectiveness 
results being sensitive to this assumption: modelling drug wastage increased the 
ICER comparing cabazitaxel with mitoxantrone to over £55,000 per QALY gained. 
The ERG updated the company's NMA and used a random effects model to perform a 
fully incremental analysis between cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and 
best supportive care using PASs for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Results showed 
that both cabazitaxel and abiraterone were extendedly dominated by the 
combination of best supportive care and enzalutamide. Preliminary guidance from 
the committee, which included wastage of cabazitaxel, did not recommend its use. 
In response, the company provided both a further discount to the confidential 
PAS for cabazitaxel and confirmation from NHS England that it is appropriate to 
supply and purchase cabazitaxel in pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags, which 
would remove the cost of drug wastage. As a result, the committee recommended 
use of cabazitaxel as a treatment option in people with an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 whose disease had progressed during 
or after treatment with at least 225 mg/m2 of docetaxel, as long as it was 
provided at the discount agreed in the PAS and purchased in either pre-prepared 
intravenous-infusion bags or in vials at a reduced price to reflect the average 
per-patient drug wastage.

BACKGROUND: Chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG) is an age-related eye disease 
causing irreversible loss of visual field (VF). Health service delivery for COAG 
is challenging given the large number of diagnosed patients requiring lifelong 
periodic monitoring by hospital eye services. Yet frequent examination better 
determines disease worsening and speed of VF loss under treatment. We examine 
the cost-effectiveness of increasing frequency of VF examinations during 
follow-up using a health economic model.
METHODS: Two different VF monitoring schemes defined as current practice (annual 
VF testing) and proposed practice (three VF tests per year in the first 2 years 
after diagnosis) were examined. A purpose written health economic Markov model 
is used to test the hypothesis that cost effectiveness improves by implementing 
proposed practice on groups of patients stratified by age and severity of COAG. 
Further, a new component of the model, estimating costs of visual impairment, 
was added. Results were derived from a simulated cohort of 10000 patients with 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) used as main outcome measures.
RESULTS: An ICER of £21,392 per QALY was derived for proposed practice improving 
to a value of £11,382 once savings for prevented visual impairment was added to 
the model. Proposed practice was more cost-effective in younger patients. 
Proposed practice for patients with advanced disease at diagnosis generated 
ICERs > £60,000 per QALY; these cases would likely be on the most intensive 
treatment pathway making clinical information on speed of VF loss redundant. 
Sensitivity analysis indicated results to be robust in relation to hypothetical 
willingness to pay threshold identified by national guidelines, although 
greatest uncertainty was allied to estimates of implementation and visual 
impairment costs.
CONCLUSION: Increasing VF monitoring at the earliest stages of follow-up for 
COAG appears to be cost-effective depending on reasonable assumptions about 
implementation costs. Our health economic model highlights benefits of 
stratifying patients to more or less monitoring based on age and stage of 
disease at diagnosis; a prospective study is needed to prove these findings. 
Further, this works highlights gaps in knowledge about long term costs of visual 
impairment.

INTRODUCTION: The comparative cost-effectiveness of all oral anticoagulants 
approved up to date has not been evaluated from the US perspective. The 
objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban 60mg, 
apixaban 5mg, dabigatran 150mg, dabigatran 110mg, rivaroxaban 20mg and warfarin 
in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients at high-risk of bleeding 
(defined as HAS-BLED score≥3).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to 
evaluate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with each of the 
six treatments from the perspective of US third-party payers. Probabilities of 
clinical events were obtained from the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE 
AF-TIMI trials; costs were derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project, and other studies. Because edoxaban is only indicated in patients with 
creatinine clearance ≤95ml/min, we re-ran our analyses after excluding edoxaban 
from the analysis.
RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60mg cost $77,565/QALY gained compared to 
warfarin, and apixaban 5mg cost $108,631/QALY gained compared to edoxaban 60mg. 
When edoxaban was not included in the analysis, treatment with apixaban 5mg cost 
$84,128/QALY gained, compared to warfarin. Dabigatran 150mg, dabigatran 110mg 
and rivaroxaban 20mg were dominated strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with creatinine clearance between 50 and 95ml/min, 
apixaban 5mg was the most cost-effective treatment for willingness-to-pay 
thresholds (WTP) above $115,000/QALY gained, and edoxaban 60mg was 
cost-effective when the WTP was between $75,000 and $115,000/QALY gained. For 
patients with creatinine clearance >95ml/min, apixaban 5mg was the most 
cost-effective treatment for WTP thresholds above $80,000/QALY gained.

The human immunodeficiency virus has infected millions of people and the 
epidemic continues to grow rapidly in some parts of the world. Antiretroviral 
(ARV) therapy has provided improved treatment and prolonged the life expectancy 
of patients. Moreover, there is growing interest in using ARVs to protect 
against new infections. Hence, ARVs have emerged as our primary strategy in 
combating the virus. Unfortunately, several challenges limit the optimal 
performance of these drugs. First, ARVs often require life-long use and complex 
dosing regimens. This results in low patient adherence and periods of lapsed 
treatment manifesting in drug resistance. This has prompted the development of 
alternate dosage forms such as vaginal rings and long-acting injectables that 
stand to improve patient adherence. Another problem central to therapeutic 
failure is the inadequate penetration of drugs into infected tissues. This can 
lead to incomplete treatment, development of resistance, and viral rebound. 
Several strategies have been developed to improve drug penetration into these 
drug-free sanctuaries. These include encapsulation of drugs in nanoparticles, 
use of pharmacokinetic enhancers, and cell-based drug delivery platforms. In 
this review, we discuss issues surrounding ARV therapy and their impact on drug 
efficacy. We also describe various drug delivery-based approaches developed to 
overcome these issues.

PURPOSE: In south Korea, the price of biologics has been decreasing owing to 
patent expiration and the availability of biosimilars. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy initiated with etanercept (ETN) 
compared with leflunomide (LFN) after a 30% reduction in the medication cost of 
ETN in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate 
response to methotrexate (MTX-IR).
METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was designed to evaluate the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of treatment sequence initiated with ETN (A) compared with 2 
sequences initiated with LFN: LFN-ETN sequence (B) and LFN sequence (C). 
Patients transited through the treatment sequences, which consisted of 
sequential biologics and palliative therapy, based on American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) responses and the probability of discontinuation. A 
systematic literature review and a network meta-analysis were conducted to 
estimate ACR responses to ETN and LFN. Utility was estimated by mapping an 
equation for converting the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
score to utility weight. The costs comprised medications, outpatient visits, 
administration, dispensing, monitoring, palliative therapy, and treatment for 
adverse events. A subanalysis was conducted to identify the influence of the ETN 
price reduction compared with the unreduced price, and sensitivity analyses 
explored the uncertainty of model parameters and assumptions.
FINDINGS: The ETN sequence (A) was associated with higher costs and a gain in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with both sequences initiated with 
LFN (B, C) throughout the lifetime of patients with RA and MTX-IR. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for strategy A versus B was 
₩13,965,825 (US$1726) per QALY and that for strategy A versus C was ₩9,587,983 
(US$8050) per QALY. The results indicated that strategy A was cost-effective 
based on the commonly cited ICER threshold of ₩20,000,000 (US$16,793) per QALY 
in South Korea. The robustness of the base-case analysis was confirmed using 
sensitivity analyses. When the unreduced medication cost of ETN was applied in a 
subanalysis, the ICER for strategy A versus B was ₩20,909,572 (US$17,556) per 
QALY and that for strategy A versus C was ₩22,334,713 (US$18,753) per QALY.
IMPLICATIONS: This study indicated that a treatment strategy initiated with ETN 
was more cost-effective in patients with active RA and MTX-IR than 2 sequences 
initiated with LFN. The results also indicate that the reduced price of ETN 
affected the cost-effectiveness associated with its earlier use.

    Lancet HIV. 2016 Dec;3(12 ):e554-e555.

BACKGROUND: With expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan 
Africa, HIV mortality has decreased, yet life-years are still lost to AIDS. 
Strengthening of treatment programmes is a priority. We examined the state of an 
HIV care programme in Kenya and assessed interventions to improve the impact of 
ART programmes on population health.
METHODS: We created an individual-based mathematical model to describe the HIV 
epidemic and the experiences of care among adults infected with HIV in Kenya. We 
calibrated the model to a longitudinal dataset from the Academic Model Providing 
Access To Healthcare (known as AMPATH) programme describing the routes into 
care, losses from care, and clinical outcomes. We simulated the cost and effect 
of interventions at different stages of HIV care, including improvements to 
diagnosis, linkage to care, retention and adherence of ART, immediate ART 
eligibility, and a universal test-and-treat strategy.
FINDINGS: We estimate that, of people dying from AIDS between 2010 and 2030, 
most will have initiated treatment (61%), but many will never have been 
diagnosed (25%) or will have been diagnosed but never started ART (14%). Many 
interventions targeting a single stage of the health-care cascade were likely to 
be cost-effective, but any individual intervention averted only a small 
percentage of deaths because the effect is attenuated by other weaknesses in 
care. However, a combination of five interventions (including improved linkage, 
point-of-care CD4 testing, voluntary counselling and testing with point-of-care 
CD4, and outreach to improve retention in pre-ART care and on-ART) would have a 
much larger impact, averting 1·10 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
and 25% of expected new infections and would probably be cost-effective (US$571 
per DALY averted). This strategy would improve health more efficiently than a 
universal test-and-treat intervention if there were no accompanying improvements 
to care ($1760 per DALY averted).
INTERPRETATION: When resources are limited, combinations of interventions to 
improve care should be prioritised over high-cost strategies such as universal 
test-and-treat strategy, especially if this is not accompanied by improvements 
to the care cascade. International guidance on ART should reflect alternative 
routes to programme strengthening and encourage country programmes to evaluate 
the costs and population-health impact in addition to the clinical benefits of 
immediate initiation.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The years of life lost were calculated using the 
'age-standardized expected years of life lost' method, the table of Japanese 
adjusted life expectancy and the database of the Institute of Legal Medicine and 
Forensic Science between September 2012 and August 2013.
RESULTS: During a period of 1 year, 430 people died and 10,056.3 years of life 
were lost in Bogota due to traffic accidents.
CONCLUSION: The mortality burden of traffic accidents in Bogota is high. Further 
studies are required in order to characterize the accidents and develop 
effective policy decisions.

In this study, Plantago major seed mucilage (PMSM) was extracted from whole 
seeds using hot-water extraction (HWE). The dill (D) essential oil components 
were identified through gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS) and its antioxidant properties were examined through the 
methods of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant 
potential (FRAP) and ß-carotene-linoleic acid assay (B-CL). Total phenolic 
content (TPC) was characterized through the Folin-Ciocalteu method and the 
antimicrobial effect was evaluated on 10 pathogenic microorganisms. PMSM edible 
coating incorporated were prepared in four different concentrations of essential 
oils, including 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5% (w/w). The control and the coated beef 
samples were analyzed periodically for microbiological (total viable count, 
psychrotrophic count, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and fungi), 
chemical (thiobarbituric acid, peroxide value and pH), and sensory 
characteristics. The IC50, FRAP, B-CL and TPC of the dill essential oil were 
equal to 11.44μg/ml, 9.45mmol/g, 82.86 and 162.65μg/ml GAE, respectively. PMSM 
extended the microbial shelf life of beef by 3days, whereas the PMSM+0.5%D, 
PMSM+1%D and PMSM+1.5%D resulted in a significant shelf life extension of the 
beef by 6, 9 and 9days, respectively, as compared to the control samples.

Catecholamines are essential for the maintenance of physiological homeostasis 
under basal and stress conditions. We aim to determine the impact of deletion of 
a single allele of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene might have on aging 
arterial pressure and life-span. We found that Th haploinsufficiency prevents 
age-associated increase of arterial pressure (AP) in mature adult mice, and it 
results in the extension of the half-life of Th-heterozygous (TH-HET) mice 
respect to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Heart performance was similar in 
both genotypes. To further investigate the lack of increase in AP with age in 
TH-HET mice, we measured the AP response to intra-peritoneal administration of 
substances involved in AP regulation. The response to acetylcholine and the 
basal sympathetic tone were similar in both genotypes, while norepinephrine had 
a greater pressor effect in TH-HET mice, which correlated with altered 
adrenoreceptor expression in blood vessels and the heart. Furthermore, 
sympatho-adrenomedular response to stress was attenuated in TH-HET mice. Plasma 
catecholamine levels and urine glucose increased markedly in WT but not in 
TH-HET mice after stress. Our results showed that TH-HET mice are resistant to 
age-associated hypertension, present a reduction in the sympathetic response to 
stress and display an extended half-life.

OBJECTIVE: In March 2014, India, the country with historically the highest 
burden of polio, was declared polio free, with no reported cases since January 
2011. We estimate the health and economic benefits of polio elimination in India 
with the oral polio vaccine (OPV) during 1982-2012.
METHODS: Based on a pre-vaccine incidence rate, we estimate the counterfactual 
burden of polio in the hypothetical absence of the national polio elimination 
program in India. We attribute differences in outcomes between the actual 
(adjusted for under-reporting) and hypothetical counterfactual scenarios in our 
model to the national polio program. We measure health benefits as averted polio 
incidence, deaths, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). We consider two 
methods to measure economic benefits: the value of statistical life approach, 
and equating one DALY to the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.
RESULTS: We estimate that the National Program against Polio averted 3.94 
million (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.89-3.99 million) paralytic polio cases, 
393,918 polio deaths (95% CI: 388,897- 398,939), and 1.48 billion DALYs (95% CI: 
1.46-1.50 billion). We also estimate that the program contributed to a $1.71 
trillion (INR 76.91 trillion) gain (95% CI: $1.69-$1.73 trillion [INR 
75.93-77.89 trillion]) in economic productivity between 1982 and 2012 in our 
base case analysis. Using the GNI and DALY method, the economic gain from the 
program is estimated to be $1.11 trillion (INR 50.13 trillion) (95% CI: 
$1.10-$1.13 trillion [INR 49.50-50.76 trillion]) over the same period.
CONCLUSION: India accrued large health and economic benefits from investing in 
polio elimination efforts. Other programs to control/eliminate more 
vaccine-preventable diseases are likely to contribute to large health and 
economic benefits in India.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) for 
patients with pelvic lymph node metastasis and special state. However, these 
data and recommendations do not distinguish the role of PLND in different 
patient groups and confirm the final benefits. The aim of this study was to 
confirm the efficacy of pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) for the different groups 
of patients.
METHODS: Data obtained from 7 centers were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 
patients, 190 pN2-3 penile carcinoma patients confirmed by bilateral inguinal 
lymph node excision were included in this study. Sixty-nine and 121 of these 
patients did and did not undergo bilateral PLND, respectively. The baseline 
differences from the patients were matched by propensity score analysis.
RESULTS: In this study, the Kaplan-Meier estimated disease-specific survival 
(DSS) was not significantly different between the PLND and no-PLND groups 
(P = 0.796). According to the propensity score matching for T stage, N stage, 
grade, adjuvant therapies, and lymph node stage (number of inguinal lymph node 
metastasis and extranodal extension), 48 patients were selected for each group. 
Among the pN2 patients, the PLND group showed higher DSS rates than the 
no-surgery group (P = 0.030). However, even after matching, survival did not 
differ between the PLND and no-PLND patients among all patients (P = 0.609) and 
pN3 patients (P = 0.417) with comparable DSS.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral PLND may improve survival in pN2 patients. Men with pN3 
may not benefit from bilateral PLND.

The introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) into clinical 
practice has dramatically changed the outcome of HIV-infected patients by 
prolonging their survival. The increase in life expectancy has led to an 
increased risk of non-AIDS-related mortality and morbidity, including 
cardiovascular diseases, neurocognitive diseases, neuroendocrine dysfunctions 
and cancer. Areas covered: The GICAT (Italian Cooperation Group on AIDS and 
Tumors) has demonstrated that patients who receive a multidisciplinary approach 
with the combination of anticancer agents (AC) and HAART can achieve better 
responses and survival rates than patients who receive AC alone. The first 
obstacle for the oncologist to plan treatment for cancer HIV-patients is the 
preliminary evaluation of drug-drug interactions between AC and HAART. Recent 
progress in pharmacogenomics could provide a new approach for personalized 
treatments. The rationale of this review is to summarize the existing data on 
the impact of HAART on the clinical management of cancer patients with HIV/AIDS 
and DDIs between antiretrovirals and AC. In addition, to maximize the efficacy 
of both concomitant therapy and to minimize the risk of DDIs, a currently useful 
list of pharmacogenomic markers of key metabolic enzymes is provided. Expert 
opinion: In this scenario, the importance of cooperation between oncologists and 
other health specialists (i.e., infectivologists, pharmacists, genetics and lab 
specialists) must not be underestimated in the management of these patients with 
the aim of planning an individual treatment strategy.

BACKGROUND: Collaborative group intervention (CGI) in patients with functional 
somatic syndromes (FSS) has been shown to improve mental quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse incremental cost-utility of CGI compared to enhanced 
medical care in patients with FSS.
METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a cluster-randomised controlled trial 
was performed. 35 general practitioners (GPs) recruited 300 FSS patients. 
Patients in the CGI arm were offered 10 group sessions within 3months and 2 
booster sessions 6 and 12months after baseline. Costs were assessed via 
questionnaire. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the 
SF-6D index, derived from the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). We 
calculated patients' net-monetary-benefit (NMB), estimated the treatment effect 
via regression, and generated cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Using intention-to-treat analysis, total costs during the 12-month 
study period were 5777EUR in the intervention, and 6858EUR in the control group. 
Controlling for possible confounders, we found a small, but significant positive 
intervention effect on QALYs (+0.017; p=0.019) and an insignificant cost saving 
resulting from a cost-increase in the control group (-10.5%; p=0.278). NMB 
regression showed that the probability of CGI to be cost-effective was 69% for a 
willingness to pay (WTP) of 0EUR/QALY, increased to 92% for a WTP of 
50,000EUR/QALY and reached the level of 95% at a WTP of 70,375EUR/QALY. Subgroup 
analyses yielded that CGI was only cost-effective in severe somatic symptom 
severity (PHQ-15≥15).
CONCLUSION: CGI has a high probability to be a cost-effective treatment for FSS, 
in particular for patients with severe somatic symptom severity.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the management 
of elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in the western 
world. It is a valuable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in 
patients, who are inoperable or at high surgical risk due to co-morbidities. The 
prevalence of aortic stenosis increases sharply with age after the sixth decade 
and is expected to have a significant impact on the geriatric health care system 
of India, given the rapid increase in life expectancy in recent years. Although 
a decade has passed since the first TAVI implantation, it is yet to penetrate 
most of the developing countries in a major way. This short review focuses on 
fundamentals of initiating a TAVI program based on the experience of a high 
volume TAVI center with a successful program in Germany.

Management of older people on dialysis requires focus on the wider aspects of 
aging as well as dialysis. Almost all frail and older patients receiving 
dialysis will default to in-center hemodialysis, although the availability of 
assisted peritoneal dialysis enables dialysis at home. As with any disease 
management decision, patients approaching end-stage renal disease need all the 
appropriate facts about their prognosis, the natural history of their disease 
without dialysis, and the resulting outcomes and complications of the different 
dialysis modalities. Hemodialysis in the older age group can be complicated by 
intradialytic hypotension, prolonged time to recovery, and vascular 
access-related problems. Peritoneal dialysis can be difficult for older patients 
with impaired physical or cognitive function and can become a considerable 
burden. Use of incremental dialysis, changes in hemodialysis frequency, and 
delivery and use of assistance for peritoneal dialysis can ameliorate quality of 
life for older patients. Understanding each individual's goals of care in the 
context of his or her life experience is particularly important in the elderly, 
when overall life expectancy is relatively short, and life experience or quality 
of life may be the priority. Indeed, some patients select the option of no 
dialysis or conservative care. With multifaceted assessments of care, physicians 
should be able to give individual patients the ability to select and continue to 
make the best decisions for their care.

Female life expectancy is currently shorter in the United States than in most 
high-income countries. This study examines work-family context as a potential 
explanation. While work-family context changed similarly across high-income 
countries during the past half century, the United States has not implemented 
institutional supports, such as universally available childcare and family 
leave, to help Americans contend with these changes. We compare the United 
States to Finland-a country with similar trends in work-family life but generous 
institutional supports-and test two hypotheses to explain US women's longevity 
disadvantage: (1) US women may be less likely than Finnish women to combine 
employment with childrearing; and (2) US women's longevity may benefit less than 
Finnish women's longevity from combining employment with childrearing. We used 
data from women aged 30-60 years during 1988-2006 in the US National Health 
Interview Survey Linked Mortality File and harmonized it with data from Finnish 
national registers. We found stronger support for hypothesis 1, especially among 
low-educated women. Contrary to hypothesis 2, combining employment and 
childrearing was not less beneficial for US women's longevity. In a simulation 
exercise, more than 75 percent of US women's longevity disadvantage was 
eliminated by raising their employment levels to Finnish levels and reducing 
mortality rates of non-married/non-employed US women to Finnish rates.

As well known, the increase in life expectancy and the better physical condition 
of people in western countries will lead in the next 20 years to a dramatic 
development of neurodegenerative diseases, especially of dementia that could be 
considered one of the most important problems in clinical, social and economic 
fields for the future. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of the various 
types of dementia is a critical step for patients, clinicians and researchers 
since an accurate "in vivo" diagnosis can lead to a better patients management. 
Neuroimaging techniques and in particular the most diffuse and affordable single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have provided useful information 
about dementia disorders and these methods, on the basis of the recent advances, 
will have an increasingly important role in research and clinical practice. The 
purpose of this article is to analyze the different SPECT techniques now 
available which proved clinically useful in correctly formulating the 
differential diagnosis of dementia.

Oxidative stress (OS), an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
antioxidant scavengers, is considered an important underlying mechanism 
associated with ageing, age-related chronic diseases and reproductive decline in 
males. However, OS is an important regulator of numerous molecular pathways 
essential for homeostasis within cells, tissues and systems. A fine balance 
between factors promoting OS and those that scavenge ROS is critically 
important. In the male reproductive tract and ejaculate, ROS are critical 
molecular players in essential reproductive processes, including 
spermatogenesis, epididymal transport, spermatozoa maturation and 
post-ejaculation processes such as motility, capacitation and the acrosome 
reaction. Increasing evidence suggests there is an overlap between age-related 
OS and male reproductive tract dysfunction correlating with reduced fertility 
potential due to semen quality decline, endocrine changes and sexual 
dysfunction. With increasing life expectancy in many regions of the world, 
together with an increasing paternal age and associated risk of for infertility, 
pregnancy complications and reduced health potential in the offspring, it is 
becoming increasingly important to fully understand the mechanism linked with 
these associations. This review considers the role of ROS and OS in fertility 
regulation, the ageing process, the role for OS in age-related reproductive 
decline, the approach to assessment in male infertility and the current use of 
antioxidants as a therapeutic option. Although evidence suggests exogenous 
antioxidant supplementation is useful in male infertility, caution to excessive 
or unnecessary use of these approaches is required to avoid the paradox of
