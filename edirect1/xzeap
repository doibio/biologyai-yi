AIM: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of office-based 
buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) in the U.S.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a model-based analysis of 
buprenorphine treatment provided in a primary care setting for the U.S. 
population with OUD.
INTERVENTION: Buprenorphine treatment provided in a primary care setting.
MEASUREMENTS: Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths over five years, 
discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs.
FINDINGS: For a cohort of 100,000 untreated individuals who enter OBBT, 
approximately 9350 overdoses would be averted over five years; of these, 
approximately 900 would have been fatal. OBBT compared to no treatment would 
yield 1.07 incremental lifetime QALYs per person at an incremental cost of 
$17,000 per QALY gained when using a healthcare perspective. If OBBT is half as 
effective and twice as expensive as assumed in the base case, the incremental 
cost when using a healthcare perspective is $25,500 per QALY gained. Using a 
limited societal perspective that additionally includes patient costs and 
criminal justice costs, OBBT is cost-saving compared to no treatment even under 
pessimistic assumptions about efficacy and cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of OBBT would be highly cost-effective compared to no 
treatment when considered from a healthcare perspective, and cost-saving when 
reduced criminal justice costs are included. Given the continuing opioid crisis 
in the U.S., expansion of this care option should be a high priority.

2,3,5-Trimethylhydroquinone (2,3,5-TMHQ) is the key precursor in the synthesis 
of vitamin E. It is still a major challenge to produce 2,3,5-TMHQ under mild 
reaction conditions by chemical methods. The monooxygenase system MpdAB can 
specifically catalyze the conversion of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (2,3,6-TMP) to 
2,3,5-TMHQ. However, the weak catalytic capacity of wild-type MpdA and the 
cytotoxicity of the substrate limited the production efficiency of 2,3,5-TMHQ. 
Here, homologous modeling and saturation mutation were performed to increase the 
catalytic activity of MpdA. Two variants, L128A and L128K, with higher activity 
toward 2,3,6-TMP (1.86-1.87-fold) were obtained. On the other hand, an evolved 
strain B5-4M-evolved with enhanced resistance to 2,3,6-TMP (8.15-fold higher for 
1000 μM 2,3,6-TMP) was obtained through adaptive laboratory evolution. 
Subsequently, a 5.29-fold (or 4.87-fold) improvement in 2,3,5-TMHQ production 
was achieved by a strain B5-4M-evolved harboring L128K (or L128A) and MpdB, in 
comparison with that of the wild type (strain B5-4M expressing MpdAB). This 
study provides better genetic resources for producing 2,3,5-TMHQ and proves that 
the synthesis efficiency of 2,3,5-TMHQ can be improved through enzyme 
modification and adaptive laboratory evolution.

Aim: Forty percent of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
(HR-MDS) transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Materials & methods: This 
retrospective study assessed the impact of HR-MDS transformation to AML on OS in 
a 6-month landmark analysis and the results were validated using a time-varying 
analysis. Results: The rate of AML transformation was 26.9% at 1 year. Patients 
who transformed to AML had a higher risk of death than patients who did not in 
the 6-month landmark analysis (HR: 1.82; p: 0.0072) and time-varying analysis at 
1 year (HR: 2.85; p < 0.0001). Patients treated with azacitidine and decitabine 
in first-line therapy had similar results. Conclusion: HR-MDS transformation to 
AML is associated with inferior OS in patients with HR-MDS initiating first-line 
therapy.

Plain Language Summary: Up to 40% of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic 
syndromes (HR-MDS) could experience deterioration or progression to acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer. We conducted a study to assess 
whether HR-MDS progression to AML had an unfavorable impact on patient life 
expectancy after initiating treatment for HR-MDS. Our study concluded that 
patients who experienced progression to AML had a higher chance of dying 
immediately after their progression to AML than patients who did not. Patients 
who received azacitidine and decitabine as their first treatment for HR-MDS had 
similar results.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is inversely associated with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk factors and brain health impairments. However, the molecular 
mechanisms linking CRF to health in children are poorly understood. We aimed to 
examine protein levels related to brain health and CVD in plasma of fit compared 
to unfit children with overweight/obesity (OW/OB). Eighty-seven children with 
OW/OB (10.08 ± 1.1 years, 59% boys) from the ActiveBrains project were included. 
CRF was measured by performing a treadmill test, and children were categorized 
into fit or unfit. Targeted proteomics in plasma was performed using Olink's 
proximity extension assay technology of Neurology panel in the whole sample and 
of Cardiovascular panel in a subsample. Sixteen proteins (PLXNB3, sFRP3, CLEC1B, 
RSPO1, Gal8, CLEC10A, GCP5, MDGA1, CTSC, LAT, IL4RA, PRSS27, CXCL1, Gal9, MERTK, 
and GT) were differentially expressed between fit and unfit children with OW/OB 
after adjusting for sex, maturational status, and body mass index. However, 
statistically significant differences disappeared after applying FDR correction. 
Potential candidate proteins related to CRF levels in children with OW/OB were 
detected, being involved in several biological processes such as neurogenesis, 
immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, platelet activation. 
Nevertheless, these preliminary findings should be confirmed or contrasted in 
future studies using larger sample sizes, longitudinal and experimental 
designs.HighlightsThe molecular mechanisms underlying the link of 
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with cardiovascular and brain health in children 
with overweight/obesity (OW/OB) are poorly understood.Targeted proteomic 
analysis revealed differentially expressed proteins (PLXNB3, sFRP3, CLEC1B, 
RSPO1, Gal8, CLEC10A, GCP5, MDGA1, CTSC, LAT, IL4RA, PRSS27, CXCL1, Gal9, MERTK, 
and GT) in plasma of "Fit" compared to "Unfit" children with OW/OB. These 
proteins are involved in several biological processes such as 
immune/inflammatory response, neurogenesis, signal transduction, and cellular 
metabolic process.Longitudinal and experimental studies are warranted to reveal 
how improvements in CRF are related to changes in circulating levels of the 
abovementioned proteins and how they might reduce cardiovascular diseases risk 
factors and brain health impairments later in life.

INTRODUCTION: First-line treatment with toripalimab plus paclitaxel and 
cisplatin (TTP) is very effective for patients with advanced or metastatic 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in China, although its effects on 
economic burden are unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of TTP from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system.
METHODS: A Markov model was established to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
first-line treatment with TTP for patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC. 
Survival data were derived from the JUPITER-06 trial. The costs and utilities 
were gathered from the literature and a local database. The primary outcomes 
were total costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at a willingness-to-pay (WTP). One-way and 
probability sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the robustness of the 
model.
RESULTS: The total cost of TTP was $123,646.43 and gained 1.10 QALYs, while the 
paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) chemotherapy group yielded 0.84 QALY at cost of 
$16,259.65. First-line TTP treatment yielded an incremental cost of $7,386.78 
with an additional 0.26 QALY, providing an ICER of $28,348.42/QALY, which was 
lower than the WTP threshold ($36,257.91) in China.
CONCLUSIONS: TTP was likely more cost-effective than TP chemotherapy from the 
perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. This study may provide evidence 
required to establish decision-making criteria to support guidance for 
cost-effective selection of an immunotherapeutic regimen.

The concept of a "speciation continuum" has gained popularity in recent decades. 
It emphasizes speciation as a continuous process that may be studied by 
comparing contemporary population pairs that show differing levels of 
divergence. In their recent perspective article in Evolution, Stankowski and 
Ravinet provided a valuable service by formally defining the speciation 
continuum as a continuum of reproductive isolation, based on opinions gathered 
from a survey of speciation researchers. While we agree that the speciation 
continuum has been a useful concept to advance the understanding of the 
speciation process, some intrinsic limitations exist. Here, we advocate for a 
multivariate extension, the speciation hypercube, first proposed by Dieckmann et 
al. in 2004, but rarely used since. We extend the idea of the speciation cube 
and suggest it has strong conceptual and practical advantages over a 
one-dimensional model. We illustrate how the speciation hypercube can be used to 
visualize and compare different speciation trajectories, providing new insights 
into the processes and mechanisms of speciation. A key strength of the 
speciation hypercube is that it provides a unifying framework for speciation 
research, as it allows questions from apparently disparate subfields to be 
addressed in a single conceptual model.

BACKGROUND: The prehospital care provided by emergency medical services (EMS) 
personnel is a critical component of the public health, public safety, and 
health care systems in the U.S.; however, the population-level value of EMS care 
is often overlooked. No studies have examined how the density of EMS personnel 
relates to population-level health outcomes. Our objectives were to examine the 
geographic distribution and density of EMS personnel in the U.S.; and quantify 
the association between EMS personnel density and population-level health 
outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of county-level EMS personnel 
density using estimates from the National Registry of Emergency Medical 
Technicians in nine states that require continuous national certification 
(Alabama, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, 
South Carolina, Vermont, and Washington, D.C.). Outcomes of interest included 
life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cardiac arrest mortality. We used 
quantile regression models to examine the association between a 10-person 
increase in EMS personnel density and each outcome at the 10th, 50th (median), 
and 90th percentiles, controlling for population characteristics and area health 
resources.
RESULTS: There were 356 counties included, with a mean EMS density of 223 EMS 
personnel per 100,000 population. Density was higher in rural compared to urban 
counties (247 versus 186 per 100,000 population; p = 0.001). In unadjusted 
models, there was a significant association between increase in EMS personnel 
density and an increase in life expectancy at each examined percentile (e.g., 
50th percentile, increase of 52.9 days; 95% CI 40.2, 65.5; p < 0.001), decrease 
in all-cause mortality at each examined percentile, and decrease in cardiac 
arrest mortality at the 50th and 90th percentiles. These associations were not 
statistically significant in the adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: EMS personnel density differs between urban and rural areas, with 
higher density per population in rural areas. There were no statistically 
significant associations between EMS density and population-level health 
outcomes after controlling for population characteristics and other health 
resources. The best approach to quantifying the community-level value that EMS 
care may or may not provide remains unclear.

Evidence of stable liquid water oceans beneath the ice crust of moons within the 
Solar System is of great interest for astrobiology. In particular, subglacial 
oceans may present hydrothermal processes in their abysses, similarly to 
terrestrial hydrothermal vents. Therefore, terrestrial extremophilic deep life 
can be considered a model for putative icy moon extraterrestrial life. However, 
the comparison between putative extraterrestrial abysses and their terrestrial 
counterparts suffers from a potentially determinant difference. Indeed, some icy 
moons oceans may be so deep that the hydrostatic pressure would exceed the 
maximal pressure at which hydrothermal vent organisms have been isolated. While 
terrestrial microorganisms that are able to survive in such conditions are 
known, the effect of high pressure on fundamental biochemical processes is still 
unclear. In this study, the effects of high hydrostatic pressure on DNA 
synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases are investigated for the first time. The 
effect on both strand displacement and primer extension activities is measured, 
and pressure tolerance is compared between enzymes of various thermophilic 
organisms isolated at different depths.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the utility of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) 
compared to surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without 
concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT) in terms of improving the life expectancy and 
quality-of-life (QOL) of patients with stage III/IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinomas (HPSCCs).
METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2018, a total of 299 patients with stage 
III/IV HPSCC who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or 
without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT, n = 111), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
(CCRT, n = 188) in our hospital were included. We measured overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS). We used the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35, and Voice 
handicap index-30 (VHI-30) instruments to assess the long-term QOL.
RESULTS: The OS and DFS afforded by SRT were significantly better than those 
associated with CCRT (p = 0.039; p = 0.048 respectively), especially for stage 
N2-N3 patients. CCRT patients experienced better speech outcomes.
CONCLUSION: For resectable stage III/IV HPSCC patients, appropriate treatment 
plans should be selected comprehensively considering survival rate, QOL, patient 
preference and multidisciplinary treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Respiratory diseases are the leading cause of hospitalization in 
Nunavik (northern Québec, Canada) and contribute to disparities in life 
expectancy with the rest of Canada. As part of Qanuilirpitaa? 2017, a 
cross-sectional population-based health survey, we sought to describe the 
prevalence of respiratory health indicators, including the first estimate of 
airway obstruction based on spirometry in an Inuit population, and explore their 
associated characteristics.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 1296 participants aged 16 years and older, using 
multivariate logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with 
spirometry-determined airway obstruction and self-reported respiratory symptoms, 
i.e., wheezing in the last year and chronic cough during at least 3 months.
RESULTS: In this relatively young population (83% aged 16 to 54), the 
prevalences of wheezing, chronic cough, and airway obstruction were, 
respectively, 27% (95% CI 24-30), 21% (18-23), and 17% (14-20). These estimates 
are prone to biases due to the relatively low participation rate (about 37%). 
The most consistent associations were with smoking (≥ 15 pack-years; odds ratio 
[OR] 3.13, 3.39, and 2.86 for the three indicators, respectively) and food 
security (OR 0.55 with wheezing and OR 0.26 with chronic cough), as defined in 
the Household Food Security Survey Module. Wheezing was also associated with 
allergic sensitization to dogs (2.60) and obesity (2.18). Chronic cough was 
associated with respiratory infections during childhood (2.12), housing in need 
of major repairs (1.72), and housing crowding (1.50), and was negatively 
associated with participation to traditional activities (0.62) and going on the 
land (0.64). Airway obstruction was associated with being underweight (3.84) and 
post-secondary education (0.40). Among young adults and women, wheezing was also 
associated with any inhalation of solvents for recreational purposes during 
their lifetime (2.62 and 1.56, respectively), while airway obstruction was 
associated with regular marijuana use (2.22 and 1.84, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Smoking and food insecurity are both highly prevalent and strongly 
associated with respiratory symptoms in Nunavik. Together with essential smoking 
prevention and cessation programs, our findings suggest that solving food 
security and housing crises, improving socioeconomic conditions, and promoting 
traditional lifestyle may improve respiratory health in Nunavik.

Publisher: RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Les maladies respiratoires sont la première cause 
d’hospitalisation au Nunavik (Nord-du-Québec, Canada) et contribuent aux écarts 
d’espérance de vie avec le reste du Canada. Dans le cadre de l’enquête 
transversale et populationnelle Qanuilirpitaa? 2017, cette étude décrit la 
prévalence d’indicateurs de santé respiratoire et explore les caractéristiques 
qui leur sont associées. Elle fournit le premier estimé de la prévalence 
d’obstruction respiratoire par spirométrie dans la population inuite. MéTHODES: 
Les données de 1 296 participants âgés de 16 ans et plus ont été analysées par 
régression logistique multivariée pour évaluer les caractéristiques associées 
avec le wheezing (dans la dernière année), la toux chronique (durant au moins 3 
mois) et l’obstruction bronchique (mesurée par spirométrie). RéSULTATS: Dans 
cette population relativement jeune (83 % entre 16 et 54 ans), les prévalences 
de wheezing, de toux chronique et d’obstruction bronchique étaient de 27 % 
(IC95% 24-30), 21 % (18-23) et 17 % (14-20). Ces estimés pourraient être biaisés 
puisque le taux de participation à l’enquête était relativement faible (environ 
37 %). Les associations les plus fortes et consistantes sont observées avec le 
tabagisme (≥ 15 paquets-années; RC 3,13, 3,39 et 2,86 pour les trois 
indicateurs, respectivement) et avec la sécurité alimentaire (RC 0,55 avec le 
wheezing et 0,26 avec la toux chronique), définie à partir du Module d’enquête 
sur la sécurité alimentaire des ménages. Le wheezing était notamment associé 
avec la sensibilisation allergique aux chiens (2,60) et l’obésité (2,18). La 
toux chronique était associée avec les infections respiratoires sévères dans 
l’enfance (2,12), un logement ayant besoin de réparations majeures (1,72) et un 
logement surpeuplé (1,50); tandis que participer aux activités traditionnelles 
(0,62) et aller souvent dans la nature (0,64) semblaient protecteurs. 
L’obstruction bronchique était associée avec un faible indice de masse 
corporelle (3,84) et un niveau de scolarité postsecondaire (0,40). Le wheezing 
était aussi associé avec le fait d’avoir déjà inhalé des solvants chez les 
jeunes adultes (2,62) et chez les femmes (1,56), tandis que l’obstruction 
bronchique était associée avec la consommation régulière de cannabis chez les 
jeunes adultes (2,22) et chez les femmes (1,84). CONCLUSION: Le tabagisme et 
l’insécurité alimentaire sont fort prévalents et fortement associés avec des 
symptômes respiratoires au Nunavik. En plus de rappeler l’importance de la 
prévention du tabagisme, ces résultats supportent la pertinence des efforts 
communautaires et gouvernementaux pour résoudre les crises de l’insécurité 
alimentaire et du logement, améliorer les conditions socioéconomiques et 
promouvoir la culture inuite afin d’améliorer la santé respiratoire au Nunavik.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a challenging pediatric and adult 
haematologic disease still associated with an unsatisfactory cure rate. Unlike 
B-ALL, the availability of novel therapeutic options to definitively improve the 
life expectancy for relapsed/resistant patients is poor. Indeed, the shared 
expression of surface targets among normal and neoplastic T-cells still limits 
the efficacy and may induce fratricide effects, hampering the use of innovative 
immunotherapeutic strategies. However, novel monoclonal antibodies, bispecific 
T-cell engagers (BTCEs), and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cells recently 
showed encouraging results and some of them are in an advanced stage of 
pre-clinical development or are currently under investigation in clinical 
trials. Here, we review this exciting scenario focusing on most relevant 
advances, challenges, and perspectives of the emerging landscape of 
immunotherapy of T-cell malignancies.

This research presents the effect of combining UV-C irradiation and vacuum 
sealing on the shelf life of strawberries and quartered tomatoes and compares it 
with the effect of the sole use of UV-C irradiation or vacuum sealing. A 
constant UV-C dose of 360 J/m2 was used for the samples' irradiation, and all 
the vacuum-sealed samples were stored at a reduced pressure of 40 kPa. 
Organoleptic analysis, microbial population quantification of yeast and mold, 
Pseudomonas sp., weight loss, and pH measurements were obtained to identify the 
spoilage occurrence, monitor the samples' quality, and quantify the shelf life. 
Sensory evaluation was conducted by 12 consumer panelists to evaluate the aroma, 
taste, color, texture, and the overall acceptance of the samples. The results 
revealed that the combination of UV-C irradiation and vacuum sealing prolongs 
the shelf life of perishables more than the sole use of UV-C irradiation or 
vacuum sealing. The achieved shelf-life increase using this combination was 
124.41% and 54.41% for strawberries and quartered tomatoes, respectively, while 
acceptable sensory characteristics were maintained throughout the storage 
period. Hence, this food preservation method can be further improved and 
integrated in the daily life of modern consumers and the operations of fresh 
produce retailers, as it could effectively reduce the spoilage rates of fresh 
produce and help achieve the UN SDG 12.3, which aims to reduce food loss and 
waste by 50% by 2030 at the consumer and retail levels. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: 
The system can be further developed and introduced to the market as a kitchen 
appliance for households or as a predistribution step for fresh produce 
distribution centers. The shelf-life extension capability of this system, which 
does not involve any use of chemical substances, would make it an attractive 
solution for households and food retailers.

Warming temperatures and diminishing dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are 
among the most pervasive drivers of global coastal change. While regions of the 
Northwest Atlantic Ocean are experiencing greater than average warming, the 
combined effects of thermal and hypoxic stress on marine life in this region are 
poorly understood. Populations of the northern bay scallop, Argopecten irradians 
irradians across the northeast United States have experienced severe declines in 
recent decades. This study used a combination of high-resolution (~1 km) 
satellite-based temperature records, long-term temperature and DO records, field 
and laboratory experiments, and high-frequency measures of scallop cardiac 
activity in an ecosystem setting to quantify decadal summer warming and assess 
the vulnerability of northern bay scallops to thermal and hypoxic stress across 
their geographic distribution. From 2003 to 2020, significant summer warming (up 
to ~0.2°C year-1 ) occurred across most of the bay scallop range. At a New York 
field site in 2020, all individuals perished during an 8-day estuarine heatwave 
that coincided with severe diel-cycling hypoxia. Yet at a Massachusetts site 
with comparable DO levels but lower daily mean temperatures, mortality was not 
observed. A 96-h laboratory experiment recreating observed daily temperatures of 
25 or 29°C, and normoxia or hypoxia (22.2% air saturation), revealed a 120-fold 
increased likelihood of mortality in the 29°C-hypoxic treatment compared with 
control conditions, with scallop clearance rates also reduced by 97%. Cardiac 
activity measurements during a field deployment indicated that low DO and 
elevated daily temperatures modulate oxygen consumption rates and likely impact 
aerobic scope. Collectively, these findings suggest that concomitant thermal and 
hypoxic stress can have detrimental effects on scallop physiology and survival 
and potentially disrupt entire fisheries. Recovery of hypoxic systems may 
benefit vulnerable fisheries under continued warming.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of denosumab versus 
alendronate for secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures among 
post-menopausal women in China.
METHODS: A validated individual-level simulation model of osteoporotic fractures 
in the Chinese setting was adapted. Allowing both treatment discontinuation and 
waning effects, the analysis aimed to evaluate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of denosumab compared to alendronate by simulating a 
cohort of previously fractured individuals over the residual lifetime from the 
healthcare system perspective. Hip, vertebral, and wrist/humeral fractures were 
tracked along with the associated medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years. 
Age-related health state utility values, health state utility values of 
fractures, costs, fracture incidence, and mortality risks for Chinese were used 
whenever available. Comparative effectiveness data were obtained from a 
published network meta-analysis. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base case, denosumab was dominated by alendronate with 
incremental costs of CN¥2743 (US$425) and incremental health outcomes of - 0.20 
quality-adjusted life-years at its current price in mainland China. It remained 
dominated in all one-way sensitivity analysis robustness checks. However, 
denosumab was cost effective if both drugs did not carry any waning effects. In 
the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, denosumab remained dominated in all 
replications.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is not cost effective for preventing secondary fractures 
among overall postmenopausal women in China. It is advisable to identify 
alternative denosumab regimens for high-risk subgroups among previously 
fractured postmenopausal women.

The present article proposes an extension of the concept of adverse childhood 
experiences (ACEs) to apply to crisis migration - where youth and families are 
fleeing armed conflicts, natural disasters, community violence, government 
repression, and other large-scale emergencies. We propose that adverse events 
occurring prior to, during, and following migration can be classified as 
crisis-migration-related ACEs, and that the developmental logic underlying ACEs 
can be extended to the new class of crisis-migration-related ACEs. Specifically, 
greater numbers, severity, and chronicity of crisis-migration-related ACEs would 
be expected to predict greater impairments in mental and physical health, poorer 
interpersonal relationships, and less job stability later on. We propose a 
research agenda centered around definitional clarity, rigorous measurement 
development, prospective longitudinal studies to establish predictive validity, 
and collaborations among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

Cabotegravir and rilpivirine long-acting (LA) antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
demonstrated similar safety and efficacy in maintaining viral suppression among 
participants switching from daily oral to LA ART in the Extension Phase of the 
FLAIR trial. The Phase IIIb SOLAR study comparing efficacy and safety of daily 
oral versus LA ART every 2 months allowed participants and health care providers 
(HCPs) to choose an oral lead-in (OLI) before LA initiation or proceed by 
immediately starting with injections (SWI). We conducted an online survey among 
SOLAR HCPs (n = 110) in 13 countries to assess reasons for choosing OLI versus 
SWI. Logistic regression was used to identify factors influencing this decision. 
Thirty-two percent of HCPs reported a future preference to use OLI, whereas 54% 
reported a future preference for SWI. HCPs had greater odds of reporting future 
intentions for SWI if they were from Continental Europe versus North America 
[adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.83, p < 0.05], from sites with a greater number of 
participants who initiated LA ART without OLI (aOR: 1.56, p < 0.01), and those 
who reported comfort with the medication safety profile (aOR: 6.39, p < 0.01). 
HCPs who participated in LA ART trials before SOLAR had decreased odds of 
reporting a preference for SWI compared to those with no prior LA ART trial 
experience (aOR: 0.11; p < 0.01). Results indicated higher intentions to SWI 
over OLI among HCPs initiating participants on LA ART. A major factor associated 
with SWI was provider comfort with safety data, reinforcing the role of 
continued training regarding an SWI approach.

BACKGROUND: Increases in life expectancy, the availability of sexual performance 
enhancing medication, and changes in sexual partnering suggest that sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) among older persons could be on the rise, yet 
there have been relatively few studies examining STIs in this demographic. Our 
systematic review aimed to further characterize the incidence and prevalence of 
chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, along with associated risk factors among 
older adults (45 years or older) in the United States.
METHODS: We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Web of 
Science, and Global Health) for data published from inception to January 2021. 
The retrieved articles were screened based on eligibility criteria, and 
subsequent review of relevant article bibliographies was conducted.
RESULTS: Of 4748 articles identified, 23 studies met our inclusion criteria and 
one additional article was identified through bibliography review. Of the 23 
included articles, only 3 (11.5%) were focused exclusively on evaluating STIs in 
an older population. We found prevalence to be the following ranges: syphilis 
(0-18%), chlamydia (0-14.2%) and gonorrhea (0-15%). Few studies specifically 
investigated risk factors in this demographic.
CONCLUSIONS: The understudied burden of STIs in the older adult population 
substantiates the need to recognize issues surrounding sexuality in this 
demographic.

Chemokine CXCL4L1, a homologue of CXCL4, is a more potent antiangiogenic ligand. 
Its structural property is correlated with the downstream receptor binding. The 
two chemokines execute their functions by binding the receptors of CXCR3A and 
CXCR3B. The receptors differ by an extra 51-residue extension in the CXCR3B 
N-terminus. To understand the binding specificity, a GB1 protein scaffold was 
used to carry different CXCR3 extracellular elements, and artificial CXCL4 and 
CXCL4L1 monomers were engineered for the binding assay. We first characterized 
the molten globule property of CXCL4L1. The structural property causes the 
CXCL4L1 tetramer to dissociate into monomers in low concentrations, but native 
CXCL4 adopts a stable tetramer structure in solution. In the titration 
experiments, the combination of the CXCR3A N-terminus and receptor extracellular 
loop 2 provided moderate and comparable binding affinities to CXCL4 and CXCL4L1, 
while sulfation on the CXCR3A N-terminal tyrosine residues provided binding 
specificity. However, the CXCR3B N-terminal extension did not show significant 
enhancement in the binding of CXCL4 or CXCL4L1. This result indicates that the 
tendency to form a chemokine monomer and the binding affinity together 
contribute the high antiangiogenic activity of CXCL4L1.

An increasingly large dataset of pharmaceutics disciplines is frequently 
challenging to comprehend. Since machine learning needs high-quality data sets, 
the open-source dataset can be a place to start. This work presents a systematic 
method to choose representative subsamples from the existing research, along 
with an extensive set of quality measures and a visualization strategy. The 
preceding article (Muthudoss et al.. in AAPS PharmSciTech 23, 2022) describes a 
workflow for leveraging near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to obtain reliable and 
robust data on pharmaceutical samples. This study describes the systematic and 
structured procedure for selecting subsamples from the historical data. We offer 
a wide range of in-depth quality measures, diagnostic tools, and visualization 
techniques. A real-world, well-researched NIR dataset was employed to 
demonstrate this approach. This open-source tablet dataset ( 
http://www.models.life.ku.dk/Tablets ) consists of different doses in 
milligrams, different shapes, and sizes of dosage forms, slots in tablets, three 
different manufacturing scales (lab, pilot, production), coating differences 
(coated vs uncoated), etc. This sample is appropriate; that is, the model was 
developed on one scale (in this research, the lab scale), and it can be great to 
investigate how well the top models are transferable when tested on new data 
like pilot-scale or production (full) scale. A literature review indicated that 
the PLS regression models outperform artificial neural network-multilayer 
perceptron (ANN-MLP). This work demonstrates the selection of appropriate 
hyperparameters and their impact on ANN-MLP model performance. The 
hyperparameter tuning approaches and performance with available references are 
discussed for the data under investigation. Model extension from lab-scale to 
pilot-scale/production scale is demonstrated. HIGHLIGHTS: • We present a 
comprehensive quality metrics and visualization strategy in selecting subsamples 
from the existing studies • A comprehensive assessment and workflow are 
demonstrated using historical real-world near-infrared (NIR) data sets • 
Selection of appropriate hyperparameters and their impact on artificial neural 
network-multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP) model performance • The choice of 
hyperparameter tuning approaches and performance with available references are 
discussed for the data under investigation • Model extension from lab-scale to 
pilot-scale successfully demonstrated.
