means and bootstrapped SEs. Regression framework was employed to estimate the 
net benefit and to illustrate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the two 
programmes in total societal costs (4353 Euros; 95% CI -3828 to 12 533) or in 
QALY (-0.006; 95% CI -0.053 to 0.042). At a threshold of 40 000 Euros, the 
LC-programme was found to be cost-effective at 15% probability; however, for 
patients with heart failure, due to increased cost savings, the probability of 
cost-effectiveness increased to 91%.
CONCLUSIONS: While the LC-programme did not appear to be cost-effective in CR, 
important heterogeneity was noted for subgroups of patients. The LC-programme 
was demonstrated to increase adherence to the rehabilitation programme and to be 
cost-effective among patients with heart failure. However, further research is 
needed to study the dynamic value of heterogeneity due to the small sample size 
in this subgroup.

Clinical Applications and Future Directions of Minimal Residual Disease Testing 
in Multiple Myeloma.

Ospedaliero-Universitaria Cittá Della Salute e Della Scienza di Torino, Turin, 
Italy.

In the last years, the life expectancy of multiple myeloma (MM) patients has 
substantially improved thanks to the availability of many new drugs. Our ability 
to induce deep responses has improved as well, and the treatment goal in 
patients tolerating treatment moved from the delay of progression to the 
induction of the deepest possible response. As a result of these advances, a 
great scientific effort has been made to redefine response monitoring, resulting 
in the development and validation of high-sensitivity techniques to detect 
minimal residual disease (MRD). In 2016, the International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) updated MM response categories defining MRD-negative responses both in 
the bone marrow (assessed by next-generation flow cytometry or next-generation 
sequencing) and outside the bone marrow. MRD is an important factor 
independently predicting prognosis during MM treatment. Moreover, using novel 
combination therapies, MRD-negative status can be achieved in a fairly high 
percentage of patients. However, many questions regarding the clinical use of 
MRD status remain unanswered. MRD monitoring can guide treatment intensity, 
although well-designed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate this potential. 
This mini-review will focus on currently available techniques and data on MRD 
testing and their potential future applications.

BACKGROUND: As the average life expectancy continues to increase, interest in 
cognitive impairment is increasing. Nowadays, as social media expands its reach, 
academic research is spreading through social media, changing the way and speed 
by which research is propagated and also who consumes this content. Therefore, 
using Altmetric, a new web-based set of metrics that analyzes the impact of 
content on social media platforms, we investigated the characteristics of 
influential research articles on the topic of cognitive impairment in social 
media.
METHODS: An Altmetric Explorer search was performed on May 25, 2018, to extract 
the following information: (i) journal name, (ii) journal impact factor (IF), 
(iii) year of publication, (iv) article topic, (v) article type, and (vi) 
cognitive impairment subtype.
RESULTS: The journal "Neurology" was the most cited journal for cognitive 
impairment articles shared on social media. Among the various types of cognitive 
impairment, most articles were related to dementia (all subtypes), Alzheimer's 
disease, and aging. The most common article type was original scientific paper, 
especially cohort study. The most popular topic was the identification of 
protective or risk factors for cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of articles with a high Altmetric Attention 
Score were somewhat different from those of articles with a high number of 
traditional citations. Social media had the disadvantage that it was difficult 
to verify the authenticity of the primary source in question, but the advantage 
was that it could immediately determine the trends regarding how information 
about that source was being shared and consumed. Therefore, it may be advisable 
to use Altmetric analysis in combination with traditional methods of evaluating 
the research articles to understand the dissemination of scientific research and 
to direct future research.

This study assessed the accuracy of marker-based kinematic analysis of the 
fingers, considering soft tissue artefacts (STA) and marker imaging uncertainty. 
We collected CT images of the hand from healthy volunteers with fingers in full 
extension, mid- and full-flexion, including motion capture markers. Bones and 
markers were segmented and meshed. The bone meshes for each volunteer's scans 
were aligned using the proximal phalanx to study the proximal interphalangeal 
joint (PIP), and using the middle phalanx to study the distal interphalangeal 
joint (DIP). The angle changes between positions were extracted. The HAWK 
protocol was used to calculate PIP and DIP joint flexion angles in each position 
based on the marker centroids. Finally the marker locations were 'corrected' 
relative to the underlying bones, and the flexion angles recalculated. Static 
and dynamic marker imaging uncertainty was evaluated using a wand. A strong 
positive correlation was observed between marker- and CT-based joint angle 
changes with 0.980 and 0.892 regression slopes for PIP and DIP, respectively, 
and Root Mean Squared Errors below 4°. Notably for the PIP joint, correlation 
was worsened by STA correction. The 95% imaging uncertainty interval was < ± 1° 
for joints, and < ± 0.25 mm for segment lengths. In summary, the HAWK marker 
set's accuracy was characterised for finger joint flexion angle changes in a 
small group of healthy individuals and static poses, and was found to benefit 
from skin movements during flexion.

Recently, several high-profile randomized clinical trials conducted with 
employees at the University of Illinois and BJ's Wholesale Club have questioned 
the value of workplace health and well-being programs. This commentary focuses 
on the latest research published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics by 
authors Jones, Molitor, and Reif who evaluated the iThrive wellness program. The 
commentary challenges the study's main finding that wellness programs (in 
general) do not work. Several perspectives are explored including whether the 
evaluated programs are well-designed, sufficiently potent, and appropriate 
candidates for randomized trials. The article also asks what role employers can 
or should play in improving the health and well-being of Americans given recent 
troubling statistics showing a decline in life expectancy and an increase in 
health risks.

This study examined the differences in single and consecutive jumps on ground 
reaction forces (GRF) as well as metatarsophalangeal (MTP), ankle and knee 
kinematics and kinetics during jumping take-off and landing. Eighteen basketball 
players performed countermovement jumps in both single and consecutive movement 
sessions. Synchronised force platform and motion capture systems were used to 
measure biomechanical variables during take-off and landing. Paired t-tests (or 
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were performed to examine any significant 
differences regarding mean and coefficient of variation in each of the variables 
tested. A Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to P-values to control the 
false discovery rate of 5%. The findings indicated that consecutive jumps had 
lower jump height, take-off velocity and landing impact. During take-off, 
consecutive jumps demonstrated larger peak MTP and ankle extension velocities, 
knee extension moments as well as larger values for ankle and knee power 
generation; During landing, the consecutive jumps had larger peak MTP flexion 
angle, joint velocities (MTP, ankle and knee), and peak knee flexion moments and 
power absorption. Additionally, consecutive jumps had higher within-trial 
reliability (i.e. smaller CV) for peak MTP flexion angle at landing (P < 0.05), 
but lower reliability (i.e. higher CV) for peak knee flexion velocity and power 
absorption at landing. These results suggest that the consecutive jump trials 
led to distinct movement kinematics and higher loading responses in jump 
take-off and landing.

From cyanobacteria to Archaeplastida: new evolutionary insights into PII 
signalling in the plant kingdom.

The PII superfamily consists of signal transduction proteins found in all 
domains of life. Canonical PII proteins sense the cellular energy state through 
the competitive binding of ATP and ADP, and carbon/nitrogen balance through 
2-oxoglutarate binding. The ancestor of Archaeplastida inherited its PII signal 
transduction protein from an ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Over the 
course of evolution, plant PII proteins acquired a glutamine-sensing C-terminal 
extension, subsequently present in all Chloroplastida PII proteins. The PII 
proteins of various algal strains (red, green and nonphotosynthetic algae) have 
been systematically investigated with respect to their sensory and regulatory 
properties. Comparisons of the PII proteins from different phyla of oxygenic 
phototrophs (cyanobacteria, red algae, Chlorophyta and higher plants) have 
yielded insights into their evolutionary conservation vs adaptive properties. 
The highly conserved role of the controlling enzyme of arginine biosynthesis, 
N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK), as a main PII-interactor has been 
demonstrated across oxygenic phototrophs of cyanobacteria and Archaeplastida. In 
addition, the PII signalling system of red algae has been identified as an 
evolutionary intermediate between that of Cyanobacteria and Chloroplastida. In 
this review, we consider recent advances in understanding metabolic signalling 
by PII proteins of the plant kingdom.

Autoimmune liver diseases (AILD), namely autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary 
biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), are rare 
diseases. These days, patients with PBC almost never require liver 
transplantation. When treated early with ursodeoxycholic acid patients have a 
normal life expectancy if the disease is diagnosed at an early stage and the 
patients respond to treatment. Patients with AIH often go into remission with 
first-line therapy including corticosteroids alone or in combination with 
azathioprine. Nevertheless, about one quarter of patients already developed 
cirrhosis at diagnosis. Those who do not respond to first line standard of care 
(SOC) have significant liver-related morbidity and mortality. No approved 
second- or third-line treatments are available and the drugs are selected based 
on limited case series and personal experience. Larger trials are needed to 
develop efficient therapies for difficult-to-treat AIH patients. No treatment 
has been found to alter the natural course of disease in patients with PSC 
except for liver transplantation. Identifying PSC patients at risk of developing 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is another unmet need. Current research in all AILD 
including AIH, PBC and PSC, focuses on improving our understanding of the 
underlying disease process and identifying new therapeutic targets to decrease 
morbidity and mortality.

INTRODUCTION: We examine the current status of the military relevance of 
opioids, their use and misuse in military and veteran populations, the national 
security consequences of opioid use in our military age population, public 
health implications, and military, veteran, and government solutions for opioid 
addiction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of recent published research, federal 
government, and related open source materials was conducted using PubMed, 
Google, and Google Scholar, and all materials retrieved were manually 
identified, screened, and evaluated for inclusion. A modified Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was 
used for the selection of relevant articles. Heath policy literature and 
relevant demographic information published within the last 5 years was also 
included to provide current information and search for solutions to address the 
escalating national opioid crisis.
RESULTS: Synthetic opioids are used for pain and trauma management, not readily 
substituted, and have exceptionally high addiction potential. Combat wounded 
veterans have greater potential for opioid misuse than civilian populations. 
Assessment, management, and treatment of opioid use in this population are 
essential. Veterans receiving synthetic opioids have been noted to have multiple 
overdose risk factors. Opioids are readily available nationally as "street 
drugs" and also in the form of fentanyl-contaminated heroin. The opioid crisis 
affects the military age population and the top states for military enlistments. 
Younger age males with lower education and income are at significant risk for 
opioid use disorder. Recently increased drug overdose deaths contribute to an 
increased U.S. mortality rate with a commensurate decline in life expectancy at 
birth. Opioid abuse contributes to increased incidence of infectious disease. 
Behavioral health programs directed at military and veterans to identify risk 
factors for opioid misuse have been introduced. Prescription drug monitoring 
initiatives continue for these populations with increased information exchanged 
between military and civilian healthcare. Lifesaving interventions for opioid 
addiction include methadone maintenance and fentanyl test strip accessibility. 
Newly implemented federal funding healthcare initiatives to the states are now 
directed at opioid use prevention and enhanced surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: Given increasing rates of opioid addiction and death, viable 
solutions are universally needed. Successful intervention measures should be 
widely shared between military, veteran, and civilian healthcare and public 
health communities. Increased collaboration between these groups could inculcate 
successful programs to prevent and decrease opioid use. Results received from 
recent military and veterans' programs for prescription and electronic medical 
record (EMR) monitoring and data sharing may also prove useful for civilian 
healthcare providers and hospital systems. Future evaluations from ongoing 
federally funded programs to the states for addiction surveillance and 
intervention may help create measures to address the proliferation of opioid 
addiction with increased death rates. Anticipated results from these federal 
efforts should help inform opioid programs in military and veterans' health 
systems.

INTRODUCTION: Voice problems are common following radiotherapy for laryngeal 
cancer. Few studies exist covering the effect of voice rehabilitation, and no 
previous studies exist regarding the cost of said rehabilitation. This 
randomized controlled study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of voice 
rehabilitation after radiotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with laryngeal cancer with 
follow-up data 12 months post-radiotherapy were included. Patients were 
randomized into receiving either voice rehabilitation (n = 32) or no voice 
rehabilitation (n = 34). The patient outcome was measured as quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). The index range between 0 and 1, where 0 equals death and 1 
represents perfect health. The QALYs were assessed with the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30 mapped 
to EuroQoL 5 Dimension values. The cost of rehabilitation and other healthcare 
visits was derived from hospital systems. The patients reported the total amount 
of sick leave days during the first 12 months following radiotherapy. The 
cost-effectiveness of the voice rehabilitation was compared with no 
rehabilitation intervention based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The cost per gained QALY with voice rehabilitation compared to no 
rehabilitation from a societal perspective was - 27,594 € (SEK - 250,852) which 
indicates that the voice rehabilitation is a cost-saving alternative compared to 
no rehabilitation due to lower costs and a slightly better health outcome. From 
a healthcare perspective, the voice rehabilitation indicates a cost 60,800 € 
(SEK 552,725) per gained QALY.
CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, i.e., including the costs of production 
loss, voice rehabilitation compared to no voice rehabilitation following 
radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer seems to be cost-saving. When analyzing only 
the healthcare costs in relation to health outcomes, voice rehabilitation 
indicates an incremental cost of 60,800 € per gained QALY, which is just above 
the threshold of the maximum willingness to pay level.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cost-effective screening strategies are needed to make 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination a reality. We determined if birth cohort 
screening is cost-effective in Italy.
METHODS: A model was developed to quantify screening and healthcare costs 
associated with HCV. The model-estimated prevalence of undiagnosed HCV was used 
to calculate the antibody screens needed annually, with a €25 000 
cost-effectiveness threshold. Outcomes were assessed under the status quo and a 
scenario that met the World Health Organization's targets for elimination of 
HCV. The elimination scenario was assessed under five screening strategies.
RESULTS: A graduated birth cohort screening strategy (graduated screening 
1: 1968-1987 birth cohorts, then expanding to 1948-1967 cohorts) was the least 
costly. This strategy would gain approximately 144 000 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) by 2031 and result in an 89.3% reduction in HCV cases, compared to 
an 89.6%, 89.0%, 89.7% and 88.7% reduction for inversed graduated screening, 
1948-77 birth cohort, 1958-77 birth cohort and universal screening, 
respectively. Graduated screening 1 yielded the lowest incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3552 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, a graduated screening scenario is the most cost-effective 
strategy. Other countries could consider a similar birth cohort approach when 
developing HCV screening strategies.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the triple procedure 
(phacovitrectomy + posterior capsulotomy, PhacoPPVc) compared to the double- 
(phacovitrectomy, PhacoPPV) or single sequential procedures.
METHODS: Prospective study on 31 eyes from 31 patients (mean age: 
72.1 ± 9.1 years; 55% females) was performed with a preoperative decision to 
undergo only pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (26%) or PhacoPPV (74%) and/or 
posterior capsulotomy based upon presence or absence of lens opacification or 
pseudophakia. Time during and between surgeries, surgical procedure codes, 
medical and transport costs, outcome and likelihood of complications after 
surgery were all included in the analysis. Societal perspectives and visual 
acuity were considered as measures of quality of adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: About 23 eyes underwent triple procedure and eight eyes underwent 
vitrectomy only (mean surgery times: 35.9 and 24.0 min, respectively). Posterior 
capsulotomy took on average 30 s, while preparation and cataract procedure took 
13.0 min. The patients travelled on average 80km (average cost: $280.12) to the 
surgery unit. The average reimbursement fee for the day procedures ranged 
between $174.17 (YAG capsulotomy; Diagnosis Related Group (DRG): 0.034), 
$1045.48 (Phaco + intraocular lens (IOL); DRG: 0.204) and $1701.32 (PPV; DRG: 
0.332). The combined procedures excluded lens and laser reimbursements, while 
the calculated reimbursements for the double/triple procedures were 
$2713.08/$2901.45, respectively, without significant loss of QALYs. PhacoPPVc 
was found to be unequivocally cost-effective, while PhacoPPV remained cost 
saving compared to sequential procedures.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the triple procedure has benefits to the 
patients, health institution and surgeon. For patients, it saves them travel and 
healing time; for health institution, it justifies the calculated higher costs 
and need for higher reimbursement for the double/triple procedures, which are 
cost saving.

BACKGROUND: An international, multicenter extension study evaluated recombinant 
fusion protein linking recombinant coagulation factor IX (FIX) with recombinant 
human albumin (rIX-FP) in hemophilia B (FIX ≤ 2%) patients previously enrolled 
in a phase III study or who initiated rIX-FP prophylaxis following surgery.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of rIX-FP 
prophylaxis in adult previously treated patients (PTPs) with hemophilia B.
METHODS: Male PTPs were treated with a 7- (35-50 IU/kg), 10- or 14-day regimen 
(50-75 IU/kg). Patients ≥18 years who were well-controlled on a 14-day regimen 
for ≥6 months could switch to a 21-day regimen (100 IU/kg).
RESULTS: A total of 59 patients (aged 13-63 years) participated in the study. 
Following a single dose of 100 IU/kg rIX-FP, in patients eligible for the 21-day 
regimen, the mean terminal half-life was 143.2 hours. Mean steady-state FIX 
trough activity levels ranged from 22% with the 7-day regimen to 7.6% with the 
21-day regimen. Median (Q1, Q3) annualized spontaneous bleeding rates were 0.00 
(0.00, 1.67), 0.28 (0.00, 1.10), 0.37 (0.00, 1.68), and 0.00 (0.00, 0.45) for 
the 7-, 10-, 14-, and 21-day regimens, respectively. Comparable efficacy was 
demonstrated for both the 14- and 21-day regimens compared to the 7-day regimen. 
Overall, 96.5% of bleeding episodes were treated successfully with 1 to 2 rIX-FP 
infusions. No patients developed an inhibitor and treatment was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: rIX-FP extended interval prophylaxis provides dosing flexibility 
and, in selected patients, a 21-day regimen may provide an alternative option to 
minimize treatment burden and individualize treatment.

The population pyramid is changing as a result of the ever-increasing life 
expectancy, which makes it crucial to acquire an in-depth understanding of the 
diseases that most often affect the elderly. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) 
affects 15%-20% of the population aged over 65 years. Despite this prevalence, 
there have been very few specific studies on the management of OSA in this age 
group, even though over 60% of the patients aged over 65-70 years who attend 
sleep units with suspicion of OSA receive treatment with continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP), on the basis of an extrapolation of the positive results 
achieved by CPAP in clinical trials involving middle-aged males. However, the 
latter's form of presentation, evolution and, probably, prognosis comparing with 
OSA are not the same as those of elderly patients. Recent clinical trials 
performed on an exclusive series of elderly patients have shed light on the 
possible role of CPAP treatment in elderly patients with OSA, but there are 
still many questions that need to be answered. The physiological increase in the 
number of sleep-related disorders with the passing of years, and the lack of 
validated diagnostic and therapeutic tools for this age group are probably the 
greatest obstacles to define, diagnose and treat OSA in the elderly.

AIM: This study summarised available evidence on the association between early 
and on-time retirement, compared with continued working, and mortality. 
Moreover, this study investigated whether and to what extent gender, adjustment 
for demographics and prior health status influence this association.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of longitudinal studies was conducted. A 
qualitative analysis of the included studies was performed, followed by a 
meta-regression analysis to assess the influence of gender, prior health and 
demographics. Random-effects models were used in a meta-analysis to estimate the 
pooled effects for relevant subgroups identified in the meta-regression.
RESULTS: In total, 25 studies were included. Adjustment for prior health and 
demographics influenced the association between retirement and mortality 
(p<0.05). The results of the meta-analysis of 12 studies are presented for 
'insufficiently adjusted' and 'fully adjusted' subgroups. There was no 
association between early retirement and mortality compared with working until 
retirement (fully adjusted subgroup: HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28). On-time 
retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with working 
beyond retirement (insufficiently adjusted subgroup: HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.41 to 
1.73). However, in the subgroup that adjusted for prior health, on-time 
retirement was not associated with mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28).
CONCLUSION: Early retirement was not associated with a higher risk of mortality. 
On-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality, which might 
reflect the healthy worker effect. It is important to consider information on 
prior health and demographics when studying the association between retirement 
and mortality to avoid biased findings.

OBJECTIVES: Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) can result in severe disability. 
Nonoperative management minimally slows scoliosis progression, but operative 
management with posterior spinal fusion (PSF) carries high risks of morbidity 
and mortality. In this study, we compare health and economic outcomes of PSF to 
nonoperative management for children with NMS to identify opportunities to 
improve care.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis. Our decision analytic model 
included patients aged 5 to 20 years with NMS and a Cobb angle ≥50°, with a base 
case of 15-year-old patients. We estimated costs, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness from 
published literature and conducted sensitivity analyses on all model inputs.
RESULTS: We estimated that PSF resulted in modestly decreased discounted life 
expectancy (10.8 years) but longer quality-adjusted life expectancy (4.84 QALYs) 
than nonoperative management (11.2 years; 3.21 QALYs). PSF costs $75 400 per 
patient. Under base-case assumptions, PSF costs $50 100 per QALY gained. Our 
findings were sensitive to quality of life (QoL) and life expectancy, with PSF 
favored if it significantly increased QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NMS, whether PSF is cost-effective depends 
strongly on the degree to which QoL improved, with larger improvements when NMS 
is the primary cause of debility, but limited data on QoL and life expectancy 
preclude a definitive assessment. Improved patient-centered outcome assessments 
are essential to understanding the effectiveness of NMS treatment alternatives. 
Because the degree to which PSF influences QoL substantially impacts health 
outcomes and varies by patient, clinicians should consider shared 
decision-making during PSF-related consultations.

OBJECTIVE: Dysglycemia, in this survey defined as impaired glucose tolerance 
(IGT) or type 2 diabetes, is common in patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and associated with an unfavorable prognosis. This European survey 
investigated dysglycemia screening and risk factor management of patients with 
CAD in relation to standards of European guidelines for cardiovascular subjects.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The European Society of Cardiology's European 
Observational Research Programme (ESC EORP) European Action on Secondary and 
Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) V (2016-2017) 
included 8,261 CAD patients, aged 18-80 years, from 27 countries. If the 
glycemic state was unknown, patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) and measurement of glycated hemoglobin A1c. Lifestyle, risk factors, and 
pharmacological management were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 2,452 patients (29.7%) had known diabetes. OGTT was 
performed in 4,440 patients with unknown glycemic state, of whom 41.1% were 
dysglycemic. Without the OGTT, 30% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 70% of 
those with IGT would not have been detected. The presence of dysglycemia almost 
doubled from that self-reported to the true proportion after screening. Only 
approximately one-third of all coronary patients had completely normal glucose 
metabolism. Of patients with known diabetes, 31% had been advised to attend a 
diabetes clinic, and only 24% attended. Only 58% of dysglycemic patients were 
prescribed all cardioprotective drugs, and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitors (3%) or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (1%) was small.
CONCLUSIONS: Urgent action is required for both screening and management of 
patients with CAD and dysglycemia, in the expectation of a substantial reduction 
in risk of further cardiovascular events and in complications of diabetes, as 
well as longer life expectancy.
