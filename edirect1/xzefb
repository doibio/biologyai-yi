system. The first algorithm was developed to determine the hip/shoulder 
extension/flexion range of motion. The second algorithm automatically determines 
the stance and swing phase per leg. To investigate the accuracy of the 
algorithms, two dogs were walked on a treadmill and measured simultaneously with 
an IMU system, an optical tracking system and two cameras. The range of motion 
estimation was compared to the optical tracking systems, with a total of 280 
steps recorded. To test the stance and swing phase detection, a total of 63 
steps were manually annotated in the video recordings and compared with the 
output of the algorithm. The IMU's-based estimation of the range of motion 
showed an average deviation of 1.4° to 5.6° from the optical reference, while 
the average deviation in the detection of the beginning and end of the stance 
and swing phases ranged from -0.01 to 0.09 s. This study shows that even simple 
algorithms can extract relevant information from inertial measurements that are 
comparable to results from more complex approaches. However, additional studies 
including a wider subject pool need to be conducted to investigate the 
significance of the presented findings.

INTRODUCTION: This study examines the background of underweight young women in 
Japan from multiple perspectives, focusing on whether they have ever dieted.
METHODS: A screening survey was administered to 5,905 underweight (BMI < 18.5 
kg/m2) women aged 18-29 years, who could report their birth weight recorded in 
their mother-child handbook. Valid responses were obtained from 400 underweight 
and 189 normal-weight women. The survey collected data regarding height, weight 
(BMI), body image and perception of weight, dieting experience, exercise habits 
from elementary school age onwards, and current eating habits. Additionally, 
five standardized questionnaires were used (EAT-26, eHEALTH, SATAQ-3 JS, TIPI-J, 
and RSES). The primary analysis was a comparative analysis (t-test/χ2)-with the 
presence or absence of underweight and diet experience as independent variables, 
and each questionnaire as a dependent variable.
RESULTS: The screening survey revealed that approximately 24% of the total 
population was underweight, with a low mean BMI. Of the respondents, more than 
half reported their body image as skinny and a small percentage as obese. 
Compared with the non-diet-experienced group (NDG), the diet-experienced group 
(DG) had a significantly higher proportion of past to current exercise habits. 
There was a significantly higher percentage of disagreement responses from the 
DG for weight and food gain than for the NDG. The NDG weighed significantly less 
than the DG in terms of birth weight, and lost weight easier than the DG. 
Additionally, the NDG was significantly more likely to agree with increasing 
weight and food intake. The NDG's exercise habits were below 40% from elementary 
school age to the present, predominantly owing to a dislike for exercise and a 
lack of opportunity to implement it. In the standardized questionnaire, the DG 
was significantly higher for EAT-26, eHEALTH, SATAQ-3 JS, and Conscientiousness 
(TIPI-J), whereas the NDG was only significantly higher for Openness (TIPI-J).
DISCUSSION: The results suggest the need for different health education programs 
for underweight women who desire to lose weight and experience dieting and for 
those who do not. This study's results are reflected in the development of 
sports opportunities optimized for each individual, and in the development of 
measures to ensure adequate nutritional intake.

BACKGROUND: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals has given injury 
prevention new attention, including halving road traffic injuries. This study 
compiled the best available evidence on injury from the global burden of 
diseases study for Ethiopia from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Injury data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted 
life years lost, years lived with disability, and years of life lost were 
extracted from the 2019 global burden of diseases study for regions and 
chartered cities in Ethiopia from 1990 to 2019. Rates were estimated per 100,000 
population.
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized rate of incidence was 7,118 (95% UI: 
6,621-7,678), prevalence was 21,735 (95% UI: 19,251-26,302), death was 72 (95% 
UI: 61-83), disability-adjusted life years lost was 3,265 (95% UI: 2,826-3,783), 
years of live lost was 2,417 (95% UI: 2,043-2,860), and years lived with 
disability was 848 [95% UI: (620-1,153)]. Since 1990, there has been a reduction 
in the age-standardized rate of incidence by 76% (95% UI: 74-78), death by 70% 
(95% UI: 65-75), and prevalence by 13% (95% UI: 3-18), with noticeable 
inter-regional variations. Transport injuries, conflict and terrorism, 
interpersonal violence, self-harm, falls, poisoning, and exposure to mechanical 
forces were the leading causes of injury-related deaths and long-term 
disabilities. Since 1990, there has been a decline in the prevalence of 
transport injuries by 32% (95% UI: 31-33), exposure to mechanical forces by 12% 
(95% UI: 10-14), and interpersonal violence by 7.4% (95% UI: 5-10). However, 
there was an increment in falls by 8.4% (95% UI: 7-11) and conflict and 
terrorism by 1.5% (95% UI: 38-27).
CONCLUSION: Even though the burden of injuries has steadily decreased at 
national and sub-national levels in Ethiopia over the past 30 years, it still 
remains to be an area of public health priority. Therefore, injury prevention 
and control strategies should consider regional disparities in the burden of 
injuries, promoting transportation safety, developing democratic culture and 
negotiation skills to solve disputes, using early security-interventions when 
conflict arises, ensuring workplace safety and improving psychological wellbeing 
of citizens.

life expectancy gap between North and South Korea, 1990-2019: An analysis of the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.

of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy gaps between North and South Korea have increased 
but contributions to these gaps remain poorly understood. Using data from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, we examined how much death from 
specific diseases contributed to these gaps in different age groups over three 
decades.
METHODS: Data for death numbers and population by sex and 5-year age groups in 
both North and South Korea from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the GBD 2019 to 
calculate life expectancy. Joinpoint regression analysis was conducted to 
investigate changes in life expectancy in North and South Korea. We used 
decomposition analysis to partition differences in life expectancy within and 
between the two Koreas into changes in age- and cause-specific death 
contributions.
RESULTS: Life expectancy increased in two Koreas from 1990 to 2019, but North 
Korea experienced a marked decline in life expectancy during the mid-1990s. The 
life expectancy gaps between the two Koreas were greatest in 1999, with a 
difference of 13.3 years for males and 14.9 years for females. The main 
contributors to these gaps were higher under-5 mortality from nutritional 
deficiencies for males (4.62 years) and females (4.57 years) in North Korea, 
accounting for about 30% of the total gap in life expectancy. After 1999, the 
life expectancy gaps reduced but persisted with differences of about ten years 
by 2019. Notably, chronic diseases contributed to about 8 out of 10 years of 
life expectancy gap between the two Koreas in 2019. Differential cardiovascular 
disease mortality in the older groups was the main contributor to the life 
expectancy gap.
CONCLUSIONS: The contributors to this gap have shifted from nutritional 
deficiencies in children younger than five years to cardiovascular disease among 
elderly people. Efforts for strengthening social and healthcare systems are 
needed to curb this large gap.

Lingual fasciculation: A point of call for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis.

Paris Cité, UFR Odontologie Paris France.

A 60-year-old female patient, with no notable medical history, was referred by 
the internal medicine department for a dry mouth workup. The clinical 
examination revealed an absence of dryness, and the presence of lingual 
fasciculations, associated with difficulties in mastication and phonation. These 
symptoms appeared spontaneously 9 months before the consultation, after leaving 
confinement. Given the presence of lingual fasciculations, the diagnostic 
hypothesis of a neurological pathology, in particular amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), was suspected. After performing an electromyogram (EMG), the 
diagnosis of ALS was retained. Riluzole treatment was then started, and physical 
therapy sessions were scheduled. Riluzole allows an average gain of 4 to 
6 months of life expectancy. Speech therapy and physical therapy allow to 
maintain the functions as long as possible and to improve the end-of-life 
conditions. The interest of early detection of ALS allows delaying the 
progression of the disease.

and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

OBJECTIVES: People with terminal illnesses often experience psychological 
distress and associated disability. Recent clinical trial evidence has 
stimulated interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelics at end of life. Much 
uncertainty remains, however, mainly due to methodological difficulties that 
beset existing trials. We conducted a scoping review of pipeline clinical trials 
of psychedelic treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress at 
end of life.
METHODS: Proposed, registered, and ongoing trials were identified from 2 
electronic databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). Recent reviews and both 
commercial and non-profit organization websites were used to identify additional 
unregistered trials.
RESULTS: In total, 25 studies were eligible, including 13 randomized controlled 
trials and 12 open-label trials. Three trials made attempts beyond randomization 
to assess expectancy and blinding effectiveness. Investigational drugs included 
ketamine (n = 11), psilocybin (n = 10), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
(n = 2), and lysergic acid diethylamide (n = 2). Three trials involved 
microdosing, and fifteen trials incorporated psychotherapy.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: A variety of onging or upcoming clinical trials are 
expected to usefully extend evidence regarding psychedelic-assisted group 
therapy and microdosing in the end-of-life setting. Still needed are 
head-to-head comparisons of different psychedelics to identify those best suited 
to specific indications and clinical populations. More extensive and rigorous 
studies are also necessary to better control expectancy, confirm therapeutic 
findings and establish safety data to guide the clinical application of these 
novel therapies.

OBJECTIVES: Rural-urban healthcare disparities exist globally. Various countries 
have used a rurality index for evaluating the disparities. Although Japan has 
many remote islands and rural areas, no rurality index exists. This study aimed 
to develop and validate a Rurality Index for Japan (RIJ) for healthcare 
research.
DESIGN: We employed a modified Delphi method to determine the factors of the RIJ 
and assessed the validity. The study developed an Expert Panel including 
healthcare professionals and a patient who had expertise in rural healthcare.
SETTING: The panel members were recruited from across Japan including remote 
islands, mountain areas and heavy snow areas. The panel recruited survey 
participants whom the panel considered to have expertise.
PARTICIPANTS: The initial survey recruited 100 people, including rural 
healthcare providers, local government staff and residents.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors to include in the RIJ were identified by the 
Expert Panel and survey participants. We also conducted an exploratory factor 
analysis on the selected factors to determine the factor structure. Convergent 
validity was examined by calculating the correlation between the index for 
physician distribution and the RIJ. Criterion-related validity was assessed by 
calculating the correlation with average life expectancy.
RESULTS: The response rate of the final survey round was 84.8%. From the Delphi 
surveys, four factors were selected for the RIJ: population density, direct 
distance to the nearest hospital, remote islands and whether weather influences 
access to the nearest hospital. We employed the factor loadings as the weight of 
each factor. The average RIJ of every zip code was 50.5. The correlation 
coefficient with the index for physician distribution was -0.45 (p<0.001), and 
the correlation coefficients with the life expectancies of men and women were 
-0.35 (p<0.001) and -0.12 (p<0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study developed the RIJ using a modified Delphi method. The 
index showed good validity.

Neck Venous Thrombosis in an Unvaccinated Adolescent Patient with COVID-19: A 
Case Report.

Medicine, Dayton, Ohio.

BACKGROUND: Orbital cellulitis is an infrequent but serious infectious 
complication of rhinosinusitis, most commonly seen in the pediatric population. 
Extension into the cavernous sinus, leading to further infection and thrombosis, 
is a rare but life-threatening complication. Although COVID-19 has been linked 
to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, most cases involve extremity 
deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; reports of intracranial or jugular 
system thrombosis are rare.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 17-year-old female patient with no 
significant medical history or thrombotic risk factors found to have orbital 
cellulitis and severe pansinusitis, complicated by multiple venous thromboses in 
the head and neck requiring emergent surgical intervention and pediatric 
intensive care admission. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: 
Extensive head and neck venous thrombosis and intracranial abscesses are rare 
complications of pansinusitis and orbital cellulitis, and the thrombotic 
complications of COVID-19 are well documented. A delay in diagnosis and 
treatment can lead to potentially devastating consequences.

BACKGROUND: Efficiency analyses have been widely used in the literature to rank 
countries regarding their health system performances. However, little place has 
been given to the environmental aspect: two countries with the same 
characteristics could experience completely different healthcare system outcomes 
just because they do not face the same environmental quality situation, which is 
a major determinant of the health of inhabitants.
METHODS: Using a stochastic frontier model, this paper analyses the effect of 
environmental quality on health system outcomes in OECD countries, measured by 
life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: We show that the healthcare system performance ranking of OECD 
countries changes significantly, depending on whether the environmental index is 
taken into account.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings, once again, underline the critical importance of 
the environment when addressing population health issues. In general, our 
results can be aligned with the messages of the One Health approach literature.

Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the major types of EB, a rare 
hereditary group of trauma-induced blistering skin disorders. DEB is caused by 
inherited pathogenic variants in the COL7A1 gene, which encodes type VII 
collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils which maintain adhesion 
between the outer epidermis and underlying dermis. DEB can be subclassified into 
dominant (DDEB) and recessive (RDEB) forms. Generally, DDEB has a milder 
phenotype, while RDEB patients often have more extensive blistering, chronic 
inflammation, skin fibrosis, and a propensity for squamous cell carcinoma 
development, collectively impacting on daily activities and life expectancy. At 
present, best practice treatments are mostly supportive, and thus there is a 
considerable burden of disease with unmet therapeutic need. Over the last 20 
years, considerable translational research efforts have focused on either trying 
to cure DEB by direct correction of the COL7A1 gene pathology, or by modifying 
secondary inflammation to lessen phenotypic severity and improve patient 
symptoms such as poor wound healing, itch, and pain. In this review, we provide 
an overview and update on various therapeutic innovations for DEB, including 
gene therapy, cell-based therapy, protein therapy, and disease-modifying and 
symptomatic control agents. We outline the progress and challenges for each 
treatment modality and identify likely prospects for future clinical impact.

In clinical follow-up studies with a time-to-event end point, the difference in 
the restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a suitable substitute for the hazard 
ratio (HR). However, the RMST only measures the survival of patients over a 
period of time from the baseline and cannot reflect changes in life expectancy 
over time. Based on the RMST, we study the conditional restricted mean survival 
time (cRMST) by estimating life expectancy in the future according to the time 
that patients have survived, reflecting the dynamic survival status of patients 
during follow-up. In this paper, we introduce the estimation method of cRMST 
based on pseudo-observations, the statistical inference concerning the 
difference between two cRMSTs (cRMSTd), and the establishment of the robust 
dynamic prediction model using the landmark method. Simulation studies are 
conducted to evaluate the statistical properties of these methods. The results 
indicate that the estimation of the cRMST is accurate, and the dynamic RMST 
model has high accuracy in coefficient estimation and good predictive 
performance. In addition, an example of patients with chronic kidney disease who 
received renal transplantations is employed to illustrate that the dynamic RMST 
model can predict patients' expected survival times from any prediction time, 
considering the time-dependent covariates and time-varying effects of 
covariates.

Nuclear Medicine, Lahore, Pakistan.

Intravenous tumor extension is a well-recognized phenomenon occurring in various 
malignancies but is a relatively rare entity in thyroid carcinoma. In patients 
with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (pDTC), I-131 avid superior vena cava 
tumor (SVC) thrombus at initial presentation is infrequent and potential life 
threatening. Tumor thrombus can form either due to direct vascular extension of 
the primary mass or by hematogenous spread. Hybrid nuclear imaging can

OBJECTIVES: The drivers of human life expectancy gains over the past 200 years 
are not well-established, with a potential role for historical reductions in 
infectious disease. We investigate whether infectious exposures in infancy 
predict biological aging using DNA methylation-based markers that forecast 
patterns of morbidity and mortality later in life.
METHODS: N = 1450 participants from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition 
Survey-a prospective birth cohort initiated in 1983-provided complete data for 
the analyses. Mean chronological age was 20.9 years when venous whole blood 
samples were drawn for DNA extraction and methylation analysis, with subsequent 
calculation of three epigenetic age markers: Horvath, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE. 
Unadjusted and adjusted least squares regression models were evaluated to test 
the hypothesis that infectious exposures in infancy are associated with 
epigenetic age.
RESULTS: Birth in the dry season, a proxy measure for increased infectious 
exposure in the first year of life, as well as the number of symptomatic 
infections in the first year of infancy, predicted lower epigenetic age. 
Infectious exposures were associated with the distribution of white blood cells 
in adulthood, which were also associated with measures of epigenetic age.
CONCLUSIONS: We document negative associations between measures of infectious 
exposure in infancy and DNA methylation-based measures of aging. Additional 
research, across a wider range of epidemiological settings, is needed to clarify 
the role of infectious disease in shaping immunophenotypes and trajectories of 
biological aging and human life expectancy.

Previous studies reported human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could enhance human 
papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cervical cancer. Therefore, the burden of cervical 
cancer associated with HIV across different regions and time periods need to be 
assessed. We aim to investigate the global burden of cervical cancer associated 
with HIV infection. Age standardized rates (ASRs) of cervical cancer 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in females (≥15 years old) were 
calculated by standardization, according the age-specific DALYs numbers 
extracted from GBD data set 2019. Population attributable fractions was 
calculated by combining the published risk ratio, with the HIV prevalence (≥15 
years old) from Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), and 
transferred to estimate the HIV-associated cervical cancer burden. Expected 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) was calculated to describe the temporal trend 
of ASR from 1990 to 2019. Pearson correlation analysis were conducted to assess 
the correlation between the ASR or EAPCs and the socio-demographic index. The 
worldwide DALYs ASR caused by HIV-associated cervical cancer rose from 3.78 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 2.19-5.56) in 1990 to 9.50 (95% CI: 5.66-13.79) in 
2019 per 100k population. In 2019, the region with the greatest burden was 
Eastern and Southern Africa, with the highest DALYs of 273 900 (95% CI: 
149 100-476 400) and ASR of 254.44 per 100k population (95% CI: 168.86-329.28). 
Notably, the Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions had the highest EAPC 
(14.07%) of HIV-associated DALYs ASR. Women in Eastern and Southern Africa 
experience the greatest burden of HIV-associated cervical cancer, while the 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions had witnessed the largest increase over 
the last 30 years. Prioritize the promotion of HPV vaccination and cervical 
cancer screening for women living with HIV were crucial in these regions.

INTRODUCTION: With an ageing population and better life expectancy, the 
prevalence of angle closure disease is expected to increase by 20% per decade. 
In 2022, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) issued a guideline on 
managing angle closure disease. Hospital eye service (HES) referral and 
prophylactic treatment are recommended only for primary angle closure suspect 
(PACS) with "Plus" features only. We aimed to examine patients previously 
treated with YAG peripheral iridotomies (YAG PI) for the presence of "PACS Plus" 
features.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients treated with YAG 
PI between 2015 and 2019 at a tertiary referral NHS eye centre was reviewed. 
Cases were examined to identify and classify patients into Primary Angle Closure 
(PAC), PACS, and Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG). Patients with PACS were 
studied for "Plus" features.
RESULTS: Six hundred twelve patients with gonioscopy-confirmed angle closure 
(defined as a minimum 180 degrees iridotrabecular contact) treated with YAG PI 
from years 2015 to 2019 were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients 
presenting with angle closure disease was 68.5 years (SD 11.3). There were 390 
(63.7%) patients with PACS, 102 (16.6%) with PAC and 120 (19.7%) with PACG. Of 
the PACS patients, 159(40.8%) patients had no "Plus" features. 181 (40.2%) 
patients had 1 "Plus" feature, 37 (9.5%) had 2 "Plus" features and 13 (3.3%) 
patients had 3 "Plus" features.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, a considerable proportion (40.8%) of PACS patients 
treated with YAG PI did not have Plus features and therefore that would not meet 
the proposed criteria for HES referral and YAG PI. With the proposed guidance, 
we expect a considerable reduction in HES referrals. Nonetheless, community 
optometry services should be supported and trained to provide monitoring for 
patients with PACS not referred to the HES.

Nowadays, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths 
and contributes to a gradually increasing disease burden. We aimed to estimate 
the secular trends of global CRC burden, the effect of age, period, and birth 
cohort, and project the global burden over time. Based on the epidemiological 
CRC data from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories from GBD 2019, the 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), was calculated from a linear model 
and joinpoint regression model. We utilized an age-period-cohort model to reckon 
age, period, and birth cohort effects on CRC age-standardized rate. The burden 
of CRC was projected by conducting the BAPC model. Globally, there was a slight 
decline in the age-standardized DALY rate, which was more apparent in females, 
with high SDI regions and in Australia and Western Europe areas. Meanwhile, our 
model predicts a weaker increase in morbidity (EAPC of 0.37) and a speedier 
reduction in mortality (EAPC of -0.66) by the next 20 years. The relative risk 
of period for high SDI regions decreased from 1.08 (95%UI: 1.06-1.1) in 
1990-1994 to 0.85 (95%UI:0.83-0.88) in 2015-2019, but worsens in low and middle 
SDI regions. The local drifts were more than 1 in the 30-34 and 35-39 age 
groups, indicating the rising tide of early-onset CRC. Given the gender and 
region-specific CRC, targeted efforts to reduce the prevalence of risk factors, 
improve screening coverage rates, and strengthen foundational medical facilities 
are necessary.

INTRODUCTION: Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is the preferred form of economic 
evaluation in many countries. As one of the key data inputs in cost-utility 
models, health state utility (HSU) has a crucial impact on CUA results. In the 
past decades, health technology assessment has been expanding rapidly in Asia, 
yet research examining the methodology and process used to generate 
cost-effectiveness evidence is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the 
reporting of the characteristics of HSU data used in CUAs in Asia and how the 
characteristics have changed over time.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify published CUA 
studies targeting Asian populations. Information was extracted for both the 
general characteristics of selected studies and the characteristics of reported 
HSU data. For each HSU value identified, we extracted data for four key 
characteristics, including 1) estimation method; 2) source of health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) data; 3) source of preference data; and 4) sample size. 
The percentage of nonreporting was calculated and compared over two time periods 
(1990-2010 vs 2011-2020).
RESULTS: A total of 789 studies were included and 4,052 HSUs were identified. Of 
these HSUs, 3,351 (82.7%) were from published literature and 656 (16.2%) were 
from unpublished empirical data. Overall, the characteristics of HSU data were 
not reported in more than 80% of the studies. Of HSUs whose characteristics were 
reported, most of them were estimated using the EQ-5D (55.7%), Asian HRQoL data 
(91.9%), and Asian health preferences (87.7%); 45.7% of the HSUs was estimated 
with a sample of 100 or more individuals. All four characteristics showed 
improvements after 2010.
CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in 
CUA studies targeting Asian populations. However, HSU's characteristics were not 
reported in most of the CUA studies, making it difficult to evaluate the quality 
and appropriateness of the HSUs used in those cost-effectiveness studies.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the changing profiles of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and modifiable risk factors is essential for CVD prevention and control. We 
aimed to report the comprehensive trends in CVD and risk factors in China from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on the incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of total CVD and its 11 subtypes for China were obtained from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019. The CVD burden attributable to 12 risk factors was 
also retrieved. A secondary analysis was conducted to summarize the leading 
causes of CVD burden and attributable risk factors.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the number of CVD incidence, death, and DALYs 
considerably increased by 132.8%, 89.1%, and 52.6%, respectively. Stroke, 
ischemic heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease accounted for over 95.0% 
of CVD deaths in 2019 and remained the top three causes during the past 30 
years. Between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardized rate of stroke decreased 
significantly (percentage of decreased incidence: -9.3%; death: -39.8%; DALYs: 
-41.6%), while the rate of ischemic heart disease increased (percentage of 
increased incidence: 11.5%; death: 17.6%; DALYs: 2.2%). High systolic blood 
pressure, unhealthy diet, tobacco, and air pollution continued to be the major 
contributors to CVD deaths and DALYs (attributing to over 70% of the CVD 
burden), and the high body mass index (BMI)-associated CVD burden had the 
largest increase between 1990 and 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant increases in the number of CVD incident cases, 
deaths, and DALYs suggest that the CVD burden is still a concern. Intensified 
strategies and policies are needed to maintain promising progress in stroke and 
to reduce the escalating burden of ischemic heart disease. The CVD burden 
attributable to risk factors has not yet made adequate achievements; even worse, 
high BMI has contributed to the increasing CVD burden.

IMPORTANCE: People with a severe mental illness (SMI) have a life expectancy 
reduced by 10 to 20 years compared with the general population, primarily 
attributable to cardiometabolic disorders. Lifestyle interventions for people 
with SMI can improve health and reduce cardiometabolic risk.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based lifestyle intervention 
among people with SMI in outpatient treatment settings compared with treatment 
as usual (TAU).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Severe Mental Illness Lifestyle 
Evaluation (SMILE) study is a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial 
performed in 8 mental health care centers with 21 flexible assertive community 
treatment teams in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were SMI, age of 18 years 
or older, and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
height in meters squared) of 27 or greater. Data were collected from January 
2018 to February 2020, and data were analyzed from September 2020 to February 
2023.
INTERVENTIONS: Weekly 2-hour group sessions for 6 months followed by monthly 
2-hour group sessions for another 6 months, delivered by trained mental health 
care workers. The intervention targeted overall lifestyle changes, emphasizing 
establishing a healthy diet and promoting physical activity. TAU (control) did 
not include structured interventions or advice on lifestyle.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Crude and adjusted linear mixed models and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. The main outcome was 
body weight change. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index, 
blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose level, quality of life, 
self-management ability, and lifestyle behaviors (physical activity and health, 
mental health, nutrition, and sleep).
RESULTS: The study population included 11 lifestyle intervention teams (126 
participants) and 10 TAU teams (98 participants). Of 224 included patients, 137 
(61.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 47.6 (11.1) years. From baseline 
to 12 months, participants in the lifestyle intervention group lost 3.3 kg (95% 
CI, -6.2 to -0.4) more than those in the control group. In the lifestyle 
intervention group, people with high attendance rates lost more weight than 
participants with medium and low rates (mean [SD] weight loss: high, -4.9 [8.1] 
kg; medium, -0.2 [7.8] kg; low, 0.8 [8.3] kg). Only small or no changes were 
found for secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this trial, the lifestyle intervention 
significantly reduced weight from baseline to 12 months in overweight and obese 
adults with SMI. Tailoring lifestyle interventions and increasing attendance 
rates might be beneficial for people with SMI.

BACKGROUND: Social anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among adolescents and 
are associated with poor quality of life and low psychosocial functioning. If 
untreated, social anxiety often persists into adulthood and increases the risk
