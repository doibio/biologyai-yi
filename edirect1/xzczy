comprehensive and up-to-date analysis on geographical and time trends from 1990 
to 2017.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we estimated the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality 
attributable to chronic respiratory diseases through an analysis of deaths, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and years of life lost (YLL) by GBD 
super-region, from 1990 to 2017, stratified by age and sex. Specific diseases 
analysed included asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary 
sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, and other chronic respiratory diseases. We also 
assessed the contribution of risk factors (smoking, second-hand smoke, ambient 
particulate matter and ozone pollution, household air pollution from solid 
fuels, and occupational risks) to chronic respiratory disease-attributable 
DALYs.
FINDINGS: In 2017, 544·9 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
506·9-584·8) worldwide had a chronic respiratory disease, representing an 
increase of 39·8% compared with 1990. Chronic respiratory disease prevalence 
showed wide variability across GBD super-regions, with the highest prevalence 
among both males and females in high-income regions, and the lowest prevalence 
in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. The age-sex-specific prevalence of each 
chronic respiratory disease in 2017 was also highly variable geographically. 
Chronic respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of death in 2017 (7·0% 
[95% UI 6·8-7·2] of all deaths), behind cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. 
Deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases numbered 3 914 196 (95% UI 
3 790 578-4 044 819) in 2017, an increase of 18·0% since 1990, while total DALYs 
increased by 13·3%. However, when accounting for ageing and population growth, 
declines were observed in age-standardised prevalence (14·3% decrease), 
age-standardised death rates (42·6%), and age-standardised DALY rates (38·2%). 
In males and females, most chronic respiratory disease-attributable deaths and 
DALYs were due to COPD. In regional analyses, mortality rates from chronic 
respiratory diseases were greatest in south Asia and lowest in sub-Saharan 
Africa, also across both sexes. Notably, although absolute prevalence was lower 
in south Asia than in most other super-regions, YLLs due to chronic respiratory 
diseases across the subcontinent were the highest in the world. Death rates due 
to interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were greater than those 
due to pneumoconiosis in all super-regions. Smoking was the leading risk factor 
for chronic respiratory disease-related disability across all regions for men. 
Among women, household air pollution from solid fuels was the predominant risk 
factor for chronic respiratory diseases in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 
while ambient particulate matter represented the leading risk factor in 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, and in the Middle East and north Africa 
super-region.
INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that chronic respiratory diseases remain a 
leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with growth in absolute numbers 
but sharp declines in several age-standardised estimators since 1990. Premature 
mortality from chronic respiratory diseases seems to be highest in regions with 
less-resourced health systems on a per-capita basis.

Despite increasing life expectancy and high levels of welfare, health care, and 
public safety in most post-industrial countries, the public discourse often 
revolves around perceived threats. Terrorism, global pandemics, and 
environmental catastrophes are just a few of the risks that dominate media 
coverage. Is this public discourse on risk disconnected from reality? To examine 
this issue, we analyzed the dynamics of the risk discourse in two natural 
language text corpora. Specifically, we tracked latent semantic patterns over a 
period of 150 years to address four questions: First, we examined how the 
frequency of the word risk has changed over historical time. Is the construct of 
risk playing an ever-increasing role in the public discourse, as the 
sociological notion of a 'risk society' suggests? Second, we investigated how 
the sentiments for the words co-occurring with risk have changed. Are the 
connotations of risk becoming increasingly ominous? Third, how has the meaning 
of risk changed relative to close associates such as danger and hazard? Is risk 
more subject to semantic change? Finally, we decompose the construct of risk 
into the specific topics with which it has been associated and track those 
topics over historical time. This brief history of the semantics of risk reveals 
new and surprising insights-a fourfold increase in frequency, increasingly 
negative sentiment, a semantic drift toward forecasting and prevention, and a 
shift away from war toward chronic disease-reflecting the conceptual evolution 
of risk in the archeological records of public discourse.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are no studies that have specifically investigated 
the cost-effectiveness of cascade screening of children for heterozygous 
familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and treatment of affected individuals with 
statins to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). This study explores the 
cost-effectiveness of this strategy from the perspective of the Australian 
public healthcare system.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with four health states (Alive without CHD, 
Alive with CHD, Dead from fatal CHD, and Dead from other causes) was developed 
to simulate the progression of ten-year-old children screened for FH and treated 
immediately with statins if found to have FH. The underlying prevalence of FH in 
this target population was assumed to be 56.8%, and the sensitivity and 
specificity of testing were 100%. The comparator was usual care, which assumed 
that subjects started statins spontaneously at a later point or when they 
experienced a cardiovascular event. The effect of reducing low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the risk of a first event at each age assumed 
that risk was proportional to total lifetime exposure and was implemented using 
Mendelian randomisation analysis data. Cost and other outcome data were sourced 
from published sources. Outcome of interests were costs in Australian dollars 
(AUD), life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, 
as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of costs per LYG and 
per QALY gained. All future costs and outcomes were discounted by 5% annually.
RESULTS: Undiscounted results showed that compared with usual care, cascade 
screening of ten year-old children for FH and initiation of treatment of 
affected individuals saved 7.77 LYG and 7.53 QALYs per person over a lifetime. 
With 5% annual discounting, there were 0.97 LYG and 1.07 QALYs gained per 
person, at net reduction cost of -$1134. The cascade screening of ten-year-old 
children for FH and initiation of treatment compared to usual case was a cost 
saving approach. In 51.2% of iterations, screening and initiation with statin 
were cost saving and in 48.8% of iterations were cost-effective. In most of the 
one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER stayed within the accepted 
Australian threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to usual care, cascade screening of ten-year-old children 
for FH and treating affected individuals are likely to be cost saving.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization's active ageing model is based on the 
optimisation of four key "pillars": health, lifelong learning, participation and 
security. It provides older people with a policy framework to develop their 
potential for well-being, which in turn, may facilitate longevity. We sought to 
assess the effect of active ageing on longer life expectancy by: i) 
operationalising the WHO active ageing framework, ii) testing the validity of 
the factors obtained by analysing the relationships between the pillars, and 
iii) exploring the impact of active ageing on survival through the health 
pillar.
METHODS: Based on data from a sample of 801 community-dwelling older adults, we 
operationalised the active ageing model by taking each pillar as an individual 
construct using principal component analysis. The interrelationship between 
components and their association with survival was analysed using multiple 
regression models.
RESULTS: A three-factor structure was obtained for each pillar, except for 
lifelong learning with a single component. After adjustment for age, gender and 
marital status, survival was only significantly associated with the physical 
component of health (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.47-0.93; p = 0.018). In turn, this 
component was loaded with representative variables of comorbidity and 
functionality, cognitive status and lifestyles, and correlated with components 
of lifelong learning, social activities and institutional support.
CONCLUSION: According to how the variables clustered into the components and how 
the components intertwined, results suggest that the variables loading on the 
biomedical component of the health pillar (e.g. cognitive function, health 
conditions or pain), may play a part on survival chances.

Resistance training in stroke rehabilitation: systematic review and 
meta-analysis.

Veldema J(1), Jansen P(1).

Author information:

Regensburg, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the effects of 
resistance training in supporting the recovery in stroke patients.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the 
PEDro databases were reviewed up to 30 April 2020.
REVIEW METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were included, who compared: (i) 
resistance training with no intervention, (ii) resistance training with other 
interventions and (iii) different resistance training protocols in stroke 
rehabilitation.
RESULTS: Overall 30 trials (n = 1051) were enrolled. The parameters evaluated 
were: (1) gait, (2) muscular force and motor function, (3) mobility, balance and 
postural control, (4) health related quality of life, independence and 
reintegration, (5) spasticity and hypertonia, (6) cardiorespiratory fitness, (7) 
cognitive abilities and emotional state and (8) other health-relevant 
physiological indicators. The data indicates that: (i) resistance training is 
beneficial for the majority of parameters observed, (ii) resistance training is 
superior to other therapies on muscular force and motor function of lower and 
upper limbs, health related quality of life, independence and reintegration and 
other health-relevant physiological indicators, not significantly different from 
other therapies on walking ability, mobility balance and postural control and 
spasticity and hypertonia, and inferior to ergometer training on 
cardiorespiratory fitness and (iii) the type of resistance training protocol 
significantly impacts its effect; leg press is more efficient than knee 
extension and high intensity training is superior than low intensity training.
CONCLUSION: Current data indicates that resistance training may be beneficial in 
supporting the recovery of stroke patients. However, the current evidence is 
insufficient for evidence-based rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions for people with 
dementia, based on cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, requires 
that the measures used to derive QALYs are preference-based whilst also being 
valid, feasible to use, comprehensible and acceptable for people with dementia. 
The aim of this study was to assess the content and face validity of six 
preference-based measures (PBMs) within the context of dementia.
METHODS: Qualitative focus groups and interviews were conducted with 
community-dwelling individuals with mild dementia and carers of people with 
dementia. After exploring participants' understanding of 'quality of life' 
(QoL), six PBMs were assessed for content and face validity: two measures 
assessing health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L and AQoL-8D); two covering broader 
aspects of capability wellbeing and social care-related QoL (ICECAP-O and 
ASCOT); and two dementia-specific QoL measures (DEMQOL-U and AD-5D). A random 
mix of one health-related QoL measure, one wellbeing measure, and one 
dementia-specific measure was explored in each session. All sessions were 
audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Nine individuals with mild dementia and 17 carers of people with 
dementia participated across 4 focus groups and 10 interviews. Participants 
perceived 9 broad QoL domains as relevant to them: Activity, Autonomy, 
Cognition, Communication, Coping, Emotions, End-of-Life, Physical Functioning, 
and Relationships. These domains had limited overlap with the content of the six 
PBMs. Assessment of face validity was summarized into eight themes: (1) 
ambiguous questions, (2) double -barrelled questions, (3) difficult/abstract 
questions, (4) judgemental/confronting questions, (5) lack of relevance and 
comprehensiveness, (6) response options, (7) layout/format and (8) 
proxy-response. There was no clear preference for one of the six measures 
explored; participants identified advantages and disadvantages across all 
measures. Although particularly designed for individuals with dementia, 
dementia-specific QoL measures were not always favoured over non-specific 
measures.
CONCLUSION: Given the shortcomings of PBMs identified in this study, further 
empirical comparative analyses are necessary to guide the selection of PBMs for 
future dementia research.

The world population increases every day as a consequence of the increase in 
life expectancy and longevity of humans. There are several factors analyzed in 
the different studies that have been developed on this topic. The research 
carried out in this field distinguishes biological, cultural, and cognitive 
factors; some of them describing similar results, while many others showed 
antagonistic results. Our study was oriented to the accomplishment of a 
bibliographical revision with the objective to verify the scientific production 
on "memory, cognitive development, and aging linked with 
longevity"-international/ national studies were analyzed and identified. The 
method carried out was through a research in the databases: SciELO, UAM, PePSIC, 
LILACS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Dialnet, and Teseo; in a period of 10 years, 
considering the studies published between January 2008 and December 2017. From 
the results found at first, 16 articles were analyzed after the application of 
the exclusion criteria. Likewise, we analyzed the relationship of longevity with 
the level of studies in Spain from a group of people over 60 years of age 
counted in January 2017. The literature review determined that there are 
psycho-cultural aspects that have a decisive influence on the increase in 
longevity, such as the performance of activities with positive mental states, 
positive emotions and experiences, and the level of studies.

Mean residual life (MRL) is the remaining life expectancy of a subject who has 
survived to a certain time point and can be used as an alternative to hazard 
function for characterizing the distribution of a time-to-event variable. 
Inference and application of MRL models have primarily focused on full-cohort 
studies. In practice, case-cohort and nested case-control designs have been 
commonly used within large cohorts that have long follow-up and study rare 
diseases, particularly when studying costly molecular biomarkers. They enable 
prospective inference as the full-cohort design with significant cost-saving 
benefits. In this paper, we study the modeling and inference of a family of 
generalized MRL models under case-cohort and nested case-control designs. Built 
upon the idea of inverse selection probability, the weighted estimating 
equations are constructed to estimate regression parameters and baseline MRL 
function. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established and 
finite-sample performance is evaluated by extensive numerical simulations. An 
application to the New York University Women's Health Study is presented to 
illustrate the proposed models and demonstrate a model diagnostic method to 
guide practical implementation.

Climate change is redistributing marine and terrestrial species globally. 
Life-history traits mediate the ability of species to cope with novel 
environmental conditions, and can be used to gauge the potential redistribution 
of taxa facing the challenges of a changing climate. However, it is unclear 
whether the same traits are important across different stages of range shifts 
(arrival, population increase, persistence). To test which life-history traits 
most mediate the process of range extension, we used a 16-year dataset of 35 
range-extending coral-reef fish species and quantified the importance of various 
traits on the arrival time (earliness) and degree of persistence (prevalence and 
patchiness) at higher latitudes. We show that traits predisposing species to 
shift their range more rapidly (large body size, broad latitudinal range, long 
dispersal duration) did not drive the early stages of redistribution. Instead, 
we found that as diet breadth increased, the initial arrival and establishment 
(prevalence and patchiness) of climate migrant species in temperate locations 
occurred earlier. While the initial incursion of range-shifting species depends 
on traits associated with dispersal potential, subsequent establishment hinges 
more on a species' ability to exploit novel food resources locally. These 
results highlight that generalist species that can best adapt to novel food 
sources might be most successful in a future ocean.

The Global cancer incidence and mortality data released by the World Health 
Organization proposes that out of 18.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed, 9.8 
million deaths occurred globally in 2018. Cancer is one of the major health 
burdens among non-communicable diseases globally responsible for impeding life 
expectancy in the present century. Disrupting hallmarks of cancer (such as 
prolonged inflammation, increased growth signal, tissue invasion and metastasis, 
unlimited proliferation and evasion of apoptosis) with dietary agents is of 
considerable focus for cancer prevention and therapy. In the last decade, a 
significant contribution has been provided in finding many plant-derived natural 
agents that can be identified as promising molecular cancer therapeutics. Our 
focus in this review is on one such natural dietary agent, Morin 
(3,5,7,2',4'-pentahydroxyflavone): a bioflavonoid. Morin exerts strong 
pharmacological properties against a multitude of cancer (liver cancer, cervical 
cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, prostate, and colon cancer). Recent progress 
has also been made in examining the potential of morin as a natural dietary 
agent for fostering the pharmacological effects of other well-known anticancer 
agents. This review provides an overview of morin and its derivatives in 
combination with anticancer agents for cancer prevention and therapy.

OBJECTIVES: A pain-free stable wrist is a prerequisite for patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis to improve their activity of daily life. The present study 
investigated whether or not radiocarpal arthrodesis yielded good results for 
more than 20 years.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 20 unstable wrists in 17 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Radiocarpal arthrodesis combined with 
synovectomy and the Darrach procedure was performed. Wrist pain, grip power, the 
range of motion, pharmacotherapy, ESR, CRP, and serial radiographs were 
investigated at the baseline and 20 years after the operation. Patient-reported 
outcomes using the mHAQ, DASH and patient's satisfaction level were investigated 
at the final follow-up.
RESULTS: Pain had disappeared completely in all patients at 20 years after the 
operation. The average grip power increased in 16 wrists (80%) and decreased in 
4 wrists (20%). Wrist extension and flexion significantly decreased, and 
supination and pronation remained within the functional range. Radiographically, 
ulnar shift and palmar subluxation initially improved and remained unchanged for 
a long time. Fourteen patients (82.4%) with 17 wrists were satisfied with this 
operation.
CONCLUSION: Radiocarpal arthrodesis for rheumatoid wrists provided painless 
stability for a long period for 20 years or more.

Publisher: TITLE: Épidémies: Leçons d’Histoire.
ABSTRACT: Jusqu’au milieu du XVIIIe siècle, l’espérance de vie était de 25 ans 
dans les pays d’Europe, proche alors de celle de la préhistoire. À cette époque, 
nos ancêtres succombaient, pour la plupart, à une infection bactérienne ou 
virale, quand la mort n’était pas le résultat d’un épisode critique, comme la 
guerre ou la famine. Un seul microbe suffisait à terrasser de nombreuses 
victimes. L’épidémie de SARS-CoV-2 est là pour nous rappeler que ce risque est 
désormais à nouveau d’actualité. Si son origine zoonotique par la chauve-souris 
est probable, la contamination interhumaine montre son adaptation rapide à 
l’homme et permet d’évoquer ainsi la transmission des épidémies, qu’elle soit ou 
non liée à des vecteurs, ces derniers pouvant représenter dans d’autres 
occasions un des maillons de la chaîne.

Cost-Effectiveness of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance: An Assessment of 
Benefits and Harms.

INTRODUCTION: The value of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is 
defined by the balance of benefits, i.e., early tumor detection, and potential 
harms, related to false positive and indeterminate results. Although physical 
harms can be observed in 15%-20% of patients with cirrhosis undergoing HCC 
surveillance, previous cost-effectiveness analyses have not incorporated costs 
of harms. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCC surveillance 
including both benefits and harms.
DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model to compare surveillance strategies of 
ultrasound (US) alone, US and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and no surveillance in 1 
million simulated patients with compensated cirrhosis. Harms included imaging 
and biopsy in patients undergoing surveillance for HCC. Model inputs were based 
on literature review, and costs were derived from the Medicare fee schedule, 
with all costs inflated to 2018 dollars. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio per incremental quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, US with AFP was the dominant strategy over 
both US alone and no surveillance. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, US 
with AFP was the most cost-effective strategy in 80.1% of simulations at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. In our 
threshold analyses, an HCC incidence >0.4% per year and surveillance adherence 
>19.5% biannually were necessary for US with AFP to be cost-effective compared 
with no surveillance.
DISCUSSION: Accounting for both surveillance-related benefits and harms, US and 
AFP is more cost-effective for HCC surveillance than US alone or no surveillance 
in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Policies that improve health and longevity are often valued by combining 
expected gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with a constant 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY. This constant is derived by dividing value 
per statistical life (VSL) estimates by expected future QALYs. We explore the 
theoretical validity of this practice by studying the properties of WTP for 
improved health and longevity in a framework that makes minimal assumptions 
about the shape of an agent's utility function. We find that dividing VSL by 
expected QALYs results in an upper bound on the WTP for a marginal improvement 
in the quality of life, as measured by gains in health status or longevity. 
Calibration results suggest that analysts using this approach to monetize health 
benefits overestimate the value of a program or policy by a factor of two on 
average. We also derive a lower bound on the WTP for improved health and 
longevity that permits a novel empirical test for the descriptive validity of 
the QALY model. Our calibrations suggest that this lower bound is on average 20% 
smaller than the actual WTP.

Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy that develops in genetically 
susceptible individuals after the ingestion of gluten. There has been a 
substantial increase in CD prevalence in the last 50 years, and it is now 
estimated that this disease affects approximately 1% of the population in the 
Western world. In the large majority of cases, CD is a benign disease, 
characterized by the complete resolution of symptoms and a normal life 
expectancy after the onset of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, failure to 
adhere to a strict GFD bears the risk of adverse events and increases mortality. 
A considerable number of studies have considered the possible association 
between CD and neoplasms. In particular, an increased risk of malignancies, such 
as cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and intestinal lymphomas, has been 
reported. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current evidence on the 
possible association between CD and cancer.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Focal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an 
emerging treatment for selected men with localized prostate cancer. A limitation 
of HIFU is the absence of a reliable tool to measure treatment effect 
intraoperatively. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been shown to be a 
promising modality for assessing the extent and boundaries of tissue ablation. 
The aim of this study was to assess the value of CEUS immediately after focal 
HIFU.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained 
registry including consecutive men undergoing focal HIFU (Focal One). Candidates 
for focal HIFU were treatment naive men with ≥10 years life expectancy, 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/ml, TNM primary tumor, regional lymph 
nodes, distant metastasis stage ≤ T2c N0 M0 with a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) 
visible lesion concordant with histologically proven prostate cancer. CEUS 
evaluation was performed immediately at the end of the procedure. Based on the 
surgeon's estimation of CEUS imaging, re-HIFU was performed, followed by another 
CEUS evaluation. To test our hypothesis, the results of the CEUS were compared 
to the results of early mpMRI to rule out clinically significant cancer. The 
concordance between the 2 tests was measured using the Cohen's kappa. The best 
model including relevant predictors was calculated with CEUS or with mpMRI to 
determine their respective added value.
RESULTS: Of 66 men who underwent HIFU, 32 met eligibility criteria. Bifocal 
treatment was performed in 1 man, increasing the number of treated lesions to 
33. Further ablation based on CEUS was delivered intraoperatively to 13 lesions 
(39%). The positive biopsy rate for clinically significant cancer in the treated 
zones was 30% (10/33). The negative predictive value of CEUS and early mpMRI was 
71% (95% confidence interval: 59%-82%). Concordance between CEUS and mpMRI was 
significant with a 72.7% agreement (P = 0.001). The model with CEUS showed the 
best accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.881.
CONCLUSION: CEUS has a higher added value compared to early mpMRI in ruling out 
clinically significant cancer after focal HIFU. It should be evaluated whether 
the use of CEUS intraoperatively enhances the efficacy of focal HIFU.

Dietary Macronutrient Distribution and Nutrition Outcomes in Persons with Cystic 
Fibrosis: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review.

McDonald CM, Bowser EK, Farnham K, Alvarez JA, Padula L, Rozga M.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) increases risk for undernutrition and malabsorption. 
Individuals with CF traditionally have been counseled to consume a high-fat 
diet. However, a new era of CF care has increased lifespan and decreased 
symptoms in many individuals with CF, necessitating a re-examination of the 
high-fat CF legacy diet. A literature search was conducted of Medline (Ovid), 
Embase, and CINAHL (EBSCO) databases to identify articles published from January 
2002 to May 2018 in the English language examining the relationships between 
dietary macronutrient distribution and nutrition outcomes in individuals with 
CF. Articles were screened, risk of bias was assessed, data were synthesized 
narratively, and each outcome was graded for certainty of evidence. The 
databases search retrieved 2,519 articles, and 7 cross-sectional articles were 
included in the final narrative analysis. Three studies examined pediatric 
participants and 4 examined adults. None of the included studies reported on 
outcomes of mortality or quality of life. Very low certainty evidence described 
no apparent relationship between dietary macronutrient distribution and lung 
function, anthropometric measures, or lipid profile in individuals with CF. The 
current systematic review demonstrates wide ranges in the dietary macronutrient 
intakes of individuals with CF with little to no demonstrable relationship 
between macronutrient distribution and nutrition-related outcomes. No evidence 
is presented to substantiate an outcomes-related benefit to a higher fat-diet 
except in the context of achieving higher energy intakes in a lesser volume of 
food.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a patient-level simulation model for predicting lifetime 
health outcomes of patients with type 1 diabetes and as a tool for economic 
evaluation of type 1 diabetes treatment based on data from a large, longitudinal 
cohort.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data for model development were obtained from the 
Swedish National Diabetes Register. We derived parametric proportional hazards 
models predicting the absolute risk of diabetes complications and death based on 
a wide range of clinical variables and history of complications. We used linear 
regression models to predict risk factor progression. Internal validation was 
performed, estimates of life expectancies for different age-sex strata were 
computed, and the impact of key risk factors on life expectancy was assessed.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 27,841 patients with type 1 diabetes 
with a mean duration of follow-up of 7 years. Internal validation showed good 
agreement between the predicted and observed cumulative incidence of death and 
10 complications. Simulated life expectancy was ∼13 years lower than that of the 
sex- and age-matched general population, and patients with type 1 diabetes could 
expect to live with one or more complications for ∼40% of their remaining life. 
Sensitivity analysis showed the importance of preventing renal dysfunction, 
hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia as well as lowering HbA1c in reducing the risk 
of complications and death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model was able to simulate risk factor progression and event 
histories that closely match the observed outcomes and to project events 
occurring over patients' lifetimes. The model can serve as a tool to estimate 
the impact of changing clinical risk factors on health outcomes to inform 
economic evaluations of interventions in type 1 diabetes.

AIMS: To estimate the impact of type 2 diabetes in terms of mortality, years of 
life lost (YLL) and productivity-adjusted life years (PALY) lost in Bangladesh.
METHODS: A life table model was constructed to estimate the productivity of the 
Bangladeshi population of current working age (20-59 years) with diabetes. 
Follow-up to 60 years (retirement age) was simulated. The life table analysis 
was then repeated assuming that the cohort did not have diabetes, with 
subsequent improvement in productivity. Differences in the results of the two 
analyses reflected the impact of diabetes on health and productivity. 
Demographic and the prevalence of diabetes data were sourced from the 
International Diabetes Foundation estimates for 2017 and mortality data were 
based on the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study. Relative risk and productivity 
indices were based on an Indian and Bangladeshi study, respectively. The cost of 
each PALY was assumed to be equivalent to gross domestic product (GDP) per 
equivalent full-time worker (US$8763). Future costs and years of life, and PALYs 
lived were discounted at an annual rate of 3%.
RESULTS: Assuming a follow-up of this population (aged 20-59 years) until age 60 
years or death, an estimated 813 807 excess deaths, loss of 4.0 million life 
years (5.5%) and 9.2 million PALYs (20.4%) were attributable to having diabetes. 
This was equivalent to 0.7 YLL, and 1.6 PALYs lost per person. The loss in PALYs 
equated to a total of US$97.4 billion lost (US$16 987 per person) in GDP. The 
results of the scenario analysis showed that the estimation was robust.
CONCLUSION: In Bangladesh, the impact of diabetes on productivity loss and the 
broader economy looms large, and poses a substantial risk to the country's 
future prosperity. This highlights the critical importance of health strategies 
aimed at the control of diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: To assess different strategies for communicating to older adults 
about stopping cancer screening.
DESIGN: 4 (recommendation statement about stopping screening)×(2; time) online 
survey-based randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 271 English-speaking participants, aged 65-90, screened for 
breast/prostate cancer at least once in past decade.
INTERVENTIONS: Time 1: participants read a scenario in which their general 
practitioner (GP) informed them about the potential benefits and harms of cancer 
screening, followed by double-blinded randomisation to one of four 
recommendation statements to stop screening: control ('this screening test would 
harm you more than benefit you'), health status ('your other health issues 
should take priority'), life expectancy framed positively ('this test would not 
help you live longer') and negatively ('you may not live long enough to 
benefit'). Time 2: in a follow-up scenario, the GP explained why guidelines 
changed over time (anchoring bias intervention).
MEASURES: Primary outcomes: screening intention and cancer anxiety (10-point 
scale, higher=greater intention/anxiety), measured at both time points.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: trust (in their GP, the information provided, the Australian 
healthcare system), decisional conflict and knowledge of the information 
presented.
RESULTS: 271 participants' responses analysed. No main effects were found. 
However, screening intention was lower for the negatively framed life expectancy 
versus health status statement (6.0 vs 7.1, mean difference (MD)=1.1, p=0.049, 
95% CI 0.0 to 2.2) in post hoc analyses. Cancer anxiety was lower for the 
negatively versus positively framed life expectancy statement (4.8 vs 5.8,
