a lesion has not been reported previously. The life expectancy and natural 
course of the disease are important factors to take into account when 
considering the individual end-point of surgery in patients. More studies on 
hypoglossal schwannomas are required, particularly cases in which the 
hypoglossal schwannoma was not totally resected, not only in order to develop 
more definitive and secure surgical treatments, but also to reduce the resultant 
unnecessary suffering of patients.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation and extension of the cell life span is 
necessary in order to enable immunotherapy to perform effectively against 
cancer. In the present study, mucin 1 (MUC1)-stimulated human mononuclear cells 
(M1SHMCs) were costimulated with bead-attached monoclonal antibodies specific 
for cluster of differentiation (CD)3 and CD28 receptors. The study was 
undertaken to determine whether costimulation was capable of enhancing the 
killing of cancer cells in vitro and of protecting non-obese diabetic severe 
combined immunodeficient mice from tumor development. Lysis of MCF-7 tumor cells 
by M1SHMCs was reduced following costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. 
Furthermore, costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 eliminated the protective 
effects of M1SHMCs on MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth in the non-obese diabetic 
severe combined immunodeficient mice. The present study suggested that 
costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 is not advisable following antigen 
activation of lymphocytes under the conditions used here. Using a lower 
anti-CD3/CD28 bead to T-cell ratio may prevent immune suppression, however, 
further studies are required to support this hypothesis.

Inorganic phosphate (Pi) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of accelerated 
aging; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we 
demonstrated in cultured cells and in vivo that increased levels of 
extracellular Pi activated the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 
(mTORC1) pathway by suppressing membrane-bound phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(PTEN) levels in a manner requiring the sodium-dependent Pi transporter PiT‑1. 
High levels of extracellular Pi also led to phosphorylation of Ser/Thr clusters 
in the C‑terminal tail of PTEN, which has been shown to dissociate PTEN from the 
membrane. Notably, blockade of mTORC1 activity by rapamycin treatment prolonged 
the life span of hyperphosphatemic α‑Klotho-deficient (Kl(-/-)) mice. Dietary 
correction of hyperphosphatemia or treatment with rapamycin also rescued the 
brown adipose tissue dysfunction and oxidative damage observed in Kl(-/-) mice. 
Furthermore, rapamycin treatment partially rescued these effects and extended 
the life span when Kl(-/-) mice were maintained on a high-phosphate diet. 
Finally, rapamycin reduced circulating Pi levels in Kl(-/-) mice, apparently by 
decreasing the localization of sodium-dependent Pi transport protein 2a at the 
renal brush border membrane. Therefore, the activation of mTORC1 may create a 
vicious loop that exacerbates the retention of Pi, which in turn may enhance 
oxidative damage and ultimately shorten the life span of Kl(-/-) mice. These 
results demonstrate that Pi has important roles in the aging process, and the 
blockade of mTORC1 may have therapeutic potential for premature aging-like 
symptoms associated with hyperphosphatemia.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has 
been shown to deliver appreciable reductions in mortality in high-risk patients. 
However, in an era of constrained medical resources, the cost-effectiveness of 
such a program needs to be demonstrated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature 
analyzing the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening using LDCT.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews-Health Technology Assessment, 
the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED), and the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Due to technological progress in CT, we 
limited our search to studies published between January 2000 and December 2014. 
Our search returned 393 unique results. After removing studies that did not meet 
our inclusion criteria, 13 studies remained. Costs are presented in 2014 US 
dollars (US$).
RESULTS: The results from the economic evaluations identified in this review 
were varied. All identified studies reported outcomes using either additional 
survival (life-years gained) or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs gained). 
Results ranged from US$18,452 to US$66,480 per LYG and US$27,756 to US$243,077 
per QALY gained for repeated screening. The results of cost-effectiveness 
analyses were sensitive to several key model parameters, including the 
prevalence of lung cancer, cost of LDCT for screening, the proportion of lung 
cancer detected as localized disease, lead time bias, and, if included, the 
characteristics of a smoking cessation program.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of a lung cancer screening program using 
LDCT remains to be conclusively resolved. It is expected that its 
cost-effectiveness will largely depend on identifying an appropriate group of 
high-risk subjects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Daclizumab high-yield process (HYP) is a humanized 
IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the α-subunit (CD25) of the interleukin-2 
receptor. The present work characterized the population pharmacokinetics of 
daclizumab HYP in healthy volunteers (HVs) and subjects with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and evaluated the effects of covariates on daclizumab 
HYP exposure.
METHODS: Measurable serum concentrations (n = 17,139) from 1670 subjects in 
seven clinical studies (three phase I, one immunogenicity, one phase II with 
extension, and one phase III) were included in this pharmacokinetic analysis 
using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The three phase I studies evaluated 
single or multiple doses that ranged from 50 to 400 mg with either intravenous 
or subcutaneous (SC) administration in HVs (n = 71). The phase II with extension 
studies evaluated doses of 150 or 300 mg SC every 4 weeks (n = 567), and the 
immunogenicity (n = 113) and the phase III (n = 919) studies evaluated 150 mg SC 
every 4 weeks, all in RRMS patients.
RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination 
adequately described daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetics. Clearance (CL) was 
0.212 L/day and the central volume of distribution was 3.92 L, scaled by [body 
weight (kg)/68] with exponents of 0.87 and 1.12, respectively. The peripheral 
volume of distribution was 2.42 L. Absorption lag time, mean absorption time, 
and absolute bioavailability (100-300 mg SC) were 1.61 h, 7.2 days, and 88 %, 
respectively. The daclizumab HYP terminal half-life was 21 days. Baseline CD25, 
age, and sex did not influence daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetics. Body weight 
explained 37 and 27 % of the inter-individual variability for CL and central 
volume of distribution, respectively. Neutralizing antibody (NAb)-positive 
status (included as a time-varying covariate) increased daclizumab HYP CL by 
19 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous findings in HVs, this analysis including 
extensive data from RRMS patients demonstrates that daclizumab HYP is 
characterized by slow CL, linear pharmacokinetics at doses above 100 mg, and 
high SC bioavailability. The pharmacokinetics of daclizumab HYP were not 
influenced by age (range 18-66 years), the sex of adult subjects, or the 
baseline CD4+CD25+ T cells (target level). The impact of covariates (body 
weight, NAb) on daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetics is unlikely to be clinically 
relevant.

Multidisciplinary treatments including mechanical ventilation and 
cardioprotective therapy have improved life expectancy in many neuromuscular 
disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For these patients, central 
nervous system disturbances such as intellectual and/or developmental disability 
can hinder social activities and communications. In myotonic dystrophy, the 
personality and/or cognitive dysfunction affects medical consultation behavior 
and decreases the efficacy of medical treatments. Understanding central nervous 
system disturbances in myopathies and providing care keeping in mind the patient 
burden are critical for improving prognosis and quality of life.

Anxiety and mood disorders in later life are the focus of an increasing amount 
of intervention research, however basic mechanisms and paradigms explaining 
etiology and maintenance warrant further exploration. Research on 
future-oriented thought patterns associated with anxiety and depression in this 
age group may prove useful, as these disorders are both characterized by a 
tendency to generate and fixate on threat-related future scenarios that may or 
may not materialize. Additionally, depression is associated with a reduced 
expectancy of positive future events. In this paper, we review the literature 
relevant to future thinking in anxiety and depression in older adults. We focus 
on the mental construction and anticipation of negative future events, and their 
underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We then consider clinical and research 
implications of anxious and depressive future-oriented thought patterns for 
older adults. We believe that more research investigating future-oriented 
thought patterns associated with emotional disorders in later life could improve 
conceptualization, measurement, and perhaps potential treatments for late-life 
anxiety and depression.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
CardioMEMS (CardioMEMS Heart Failure System, St Jude Medical Inc, Atlanta, 
Georgia) device in patients with chronic heart failure.
BACKGROUND: The CardioMEMS device, an implantable pulmonary artery pressure 
monitor, was shown to reduce hospitalizations for heart failure and improve 
quality of life in the CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of 
Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients) trial.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to determine the hospitalization, survival, 
quality of life, cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CardioMEMS 
implantation compared with usual care among a CHAMPION trial cohort of patients 
with heart failure. We obtained event rates and utilities from published trial 
data; we used costs from literature estimates and Medicare reimbursement data. 
We performed subgroup analyses of preserved and reduced ejection fraction and an 
exploratory analysis in a lower-risk cohort on the basis of the CHARM 
(Candesartan in Heart failure: Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) trials.
RESULTS: CardioMEMS reduced lifetime hospitalizations (2.18 vs. 3.12), increased 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (2.74 vs. 2.46), and increased costs 
($176,648 vs. $156,569), thus yielding a cost of $71,462 per QALY gained and 
$48,054 per life-year gained. The cost per QALY gained was $82,301 in patients 
with reduced ejection fraction and $47,768 in those with preserved ejection 
fraction. In the lower-risk CHARM cohort, the device would need to reduce 
hospitalizations for heart failure by 41% to cost <$100,000 per QALY gained. The 
cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the device's durability.
CONCLUSIONS: In populations similar to that of the CHAMPION trial, the 
CardioMEMS device is cost-effective if the trial effectiveness is sustained over 
long periods. Post-marketing surveillance data on durability will further 
clarify its value.

BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arbovirus infection globally, but its 
burden is poorly quantified. We estimated dengue mortality, incidence, and 
burden for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.
METHODS: We modelled mortality from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and 
surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble Modelling tool. We modelled 
incidence from officially reported cases, and adjusted our raw estimates for 
under-reporting based on published estimates of expansion factors. In total, we 
had 1780 country-years of mortality data from 130 countries, 1636 country-years 
of dengue case reports from 76 countries, and expansion factor estimates for 14 
countries.
FINDINGS: We estimated an average of 9221 dengue deaths per year between 1990 
and 2013, increasing from a low of 8277 (95% uncertainty estimate 5353-10 649) 
in 1992, to a peak of 11 302 (6790-13 722) in 2010. This yielded a total of 
576 900 (330 000-701 200) years of life lost to premature mortality attributable 
to dengue in 2013. The incidence of dengue increased greatly between 1990 and 
2013, with the number of cases more than doubling every decade, from 8·3 million 
(3·3 million-17·2 million) apparent cases in 1990, to 58·4 million (23·6 
million-121·9 million) apparent cases in 2013. When accounting for disability 
from moderate and severe acute dengue, and post-dengue chronic fatigue, 566 000 
(186 000-1 415 000) years lived with disability were attributable to dengue in 
2013. Considering fatal and non-fatal outcomes together, dengue was responsible 
for 1·14 million (0·73 million-1·98 million) disability-adjusted life-years in 
2013.
INTERPRETATION: Although lower than other estimates, our results offer more 
evidence that the true symptomatic incidence of dengue probably falls within the 
commonly cited range of 50 million to 100 million cases per year. Our mortality 
estimates are lower than those presented elsewhere and should be considered in 
light of the totality of evidence suggesting that dengue mortality might, in 
fact, be substantially higher.

The aim of this article is to introduce the methodology of disease burden (DB) 
to quantify the health impact of microbial regrowth during wastewater reuse, 
using the case study of a decentralized water reuse system in Xi'an Si-yuan 
University, located in Xi'an, China. Based on field investigation findings, 
Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella and rotavirus were selected as typical 
regrowth pathogens causing potential health hazards during the reuse of 
reclaimed water. Subsequently, major exposure routes including sprinkler 
irrigation, landscape fountains and toilet flushing were identified. 
Mathematical models were established to build the relationship between exposure 
dose and disease burden by calculating the disability adjusted life year (DALY). 
Results of disease burden for this case study show that DALYs attributed to E. 
coli were significantly greater than those caused by other pathogens, and DALYs 
associated with sprinkler irrigation were higher than those originating from 
other routes. A correlation between exposure dose and disease was obtained by 
introducing a modified calculation of morbidity, which can extend the assessment 
endpoint of health risk to disease burden from the conventional infection rate.

rates allocate more resources toward reproduction relative to self-maintenance 
and reach maturity earlier ('fast pace of life') than those having greater life 
expectancy and reproducing at a lower rate ('slow pace of life'). Among birds, 
many studies have shown that tropical species have a slower pace of life than 
temperate-breeding species. The pace of life has been hypothesized to affect 
metabolism and, as predicted, tropical birds have lower basal metabolic rates 
(BMR) than temperate-breeding birds. However, many temperate-breeding Australian 
passerines belong to lineages that evolved in Australia and share 'slow' 
life-history traits that are typical of tropical birds. We obtained BMR from 30 
of these 'old-endemics' and ten sympatric species of more recently arrived 
passerine lineages (derived from Afro-Asian origins or introduced by Europeans) 
with 'faster' life histories. The BMR of 'slow' temperate-breeding old-endemics 
was indistinguishable from that of new-arrivals and was not lower than the BMR 
of 'fast' temperate-breeding non-Australian passerines. Old-endemics had 
substantially smaller clutches and longer maximal life spans in the wild than 
new arrivals, but neither clutch size nor maximum life span was correlated with 
BMR. Our results suggest that low BMR in tropical birds is not functionally 
linked to their 'slow pace of life' and instead may be a consequence of 
differences in annual thermal conditions experienced by tropical versus 
temperate species.

BACKGROUND: Extension loss is a potentially devastating consequence of anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It can often be treated by anterior 
arthroscopic release. In rare cases, a chronic flexion contracture requires an 
additional posterior open release. To our knowledge, no study analysing the 
results of both posteromedial and posterolateral approaches has been performed 
so far. The purposes of this study were (1) to analyse the midterm outcome and 
complications of a combined procedure, anterior arthroscopic debridement and 
posterior open capsulotomy - for the treatment of chronic extension deficits 
after ACLR and (2) to describe the surgical technique of posterior open release 
with both posteromedial and posterolateral approaches.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective clinical cohort study. Twelve 
patients presenting a chronic flexion contracture of 10° or more after ACLR 
treated by open posterior arthrolysis with an average follow-up time of 38months 
(range six to 90) were included. At last follow-up, they underwent both a 
clinical examination with range of motion analysis, International Knee 
Documentation Committee (IKDC) and KOOS scores.
RESULTS: At follow-up, all patients except one (93%) achieved complete 
extension. Only one patient (7%) had a residual post-operative flexion deformity 
of five degrees. The range of motion (ROM) improved significantly after 
arthrolysis from 96°±14.3° (SD) to 14.3°±7°(SD)(p<0.001). No post-operative 
complications were recorded. No patients required further open debridement. The 
post-operative objective IKDC score was grade A for five patients, B for seven 
versus C for five patients and D for seven preoperatively. The mean 
post-operative subjective IKDC score was 86.4±9.7. The post-operative Knee 
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) distribution was as follows: pain 
93.8±5 (SD); symptoms 88±8.6 (SD); ADL 96.8±3.7 (SD); sports activities 
83.6±12.3 (SD); and quality of life 82.9±8.8 (SD). Mean patients' satisfaction 
was 9.25±0.6 (SD) out of 10 after arthrolysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Open posterior release with both posteromedial and posterolateral 
approaches is a safe and efficient additional procedure in case of persistent 
flexion contracture after ACLR with good ROM gain, functional scores and 
patients' satisfaction.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study - Level IV.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease. It 
leads to irreversible joint damage, physical handicap, and reduced life 
expectancy. The past two decades have seen considerable therapeutic advances 
with the development of biologic treatments to block proinflammatory cytokines 
or modulate lymphocyte function, followed by the development of small molecules 
to target intracellular signaling. Nevertheless, only a minority of patients can 
achieve disease remission, especially long term, warranting further 
investigation into newer therapeutic options. Targeting single proinflammatory 
pathways may not be sufficient, as suggested by variable results with T helper 
(Th)-17-related cytokine blockade. Multilevel information from 'omics' 
techniques along with data from mechanistic studies might facilitate the 
identification of pivotal checkpoints in RA disease pathogenesis and the 
subsequent development of new effective treatments.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disease 
characterized by elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) and increased risk of premature atherosclerotic coronary heart disease 
(CHD). Patients with FH in Hong Kong were found by the identification of 
potential probands with primary hypercholesterolemia manifesting total 
cholesterol levels greater than 7.5 mmol/L or LDL-C levels greater than 4.9 
mmol/L and undertaking cascade screening of available relatives in the 
Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese 
University of Hong Kong since the early 1990s. Our previous study in a group of 
252 subjects from 87 pedigrees clinically diagnosed as having heterozygous FH 
reported the mean plasma LDL-C level as 7.2±1.5 mmol/L. Xanthomata were present 
in 40.6% of males and 54.8% of females. The prevalence of known CHD was 
relatively low at 9.9% in males and 8.5% in females. All FH patients were 
offered treatment with statins and many of them reached the LDL-C goal with a 
moderate or high dose of potent statin alone. Ezetimibe is usually added for 
patients who have not achieved target LDL-C levels on statin alone, particularly 
in patients with established CHD. Some FH patients who have not achieved the 
LDL-C targets with this combination have entered into clinical trials with new 
cholesterol-modifying agents such as the monoclonal antibodies to proprotein 
convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9. Increased awareness, early identification, 
and optimal treatment are essential to reduce the risk of CHD, increase life 
expectancy, and improve the quality of life of patients with FH.

Calorie restriction (CR) consistently extends longevity and delays age-related 
diseases across several animal models. We have previously shown that different 
dietary fat sources can modulate life span and mitochondrial ultrastructure, 
function and membrane fatty acid composition in mice maintained on a 40% CR. In 
particular, animals consuming lard as the main fat source (CR-Lard) lived longer 
than CR mice consuming diets with soybean oil (CR-Soy) or fish oil (CR-Fish) as 
the predominant lipid source. In the present work, a transcriptomic analysis in 
the liver and skeletal muscle was performed in order to elucidate possible 
mechanisms underlying the changes in energy metabolism and longevity induced by 
dietary fat in CR mice. After 8 months of CR, transcription downstream of 
several mediators of inflammation was inhibited in liver. In contrast, 
proinflammatory signaling was increased in the CR-Fish versus other CR groups. 
Dietary fish oil induced a gene expression pattern consistent with increased 
transcriptional regulation by several cytokines (TNF, GM-CSF, TGF-β) and sex 
hormones when compared to the other CR groups. The CR-Fish also had lower 
expression of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and increased expression 
of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation genes than the other CR 
diet groups. Our data suggest that a diet high in n-3 PUFA, partially reverts 
CR-related changes in gene expression of key processes, such as inflammation and 
steroid hormone signaling, and this may mitigate life span extension with CR in 
mice consuming diets high in fish oil.

Bipolar depression is the most common and difficult-to-treat phase of bipolar 
disorder. Antidepressants for unipolar depression are among the most widely used 
drugs, but recent data and meta-analyses indicate a lack of efficacy. Many of 
the drugs discussed here are graded provisionally for the strength of the 
findings in the literature, safety and tolerability, and likely utility of use 
in patients with bipolar disorder. Successful long-term treatment of bipolar 
depression is critical to preventing illness-related morbidity, disability, 
cognitive decline, suicide, and premature loss of years of life expectancy 
largely from the excess medical mortality associated with cardiovascular 
disorders.

Functionally and physiologically active peptides are produced from several food 
proteins during gastrointestinal digestion and fermentation of food materials 
with lactic acid bacteria. Once bioactive peptides (BPs) are liberated, they 
exhibit a wide variety of physiological functions in the human body such as 
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. These 
functionalities of the peptides in human health and physiology include 
antihypertensive, antimicrobial, antioxidative, antithrombotic, opioid, 
anti-appetizing, immunomodulatory and mineral-binding activities. Most of the 
bioactivities of milk proteins are latent, being absent or incomplete in the 
original native protein, but full activities are manifested upon proteolytic 
digestion to release and activate encrypted bioactive peptides from the original 
protein. Bioactive peptides have been identified within the amino acid sequences 
of native milk proteins. Due to their physiological and physico-chemical 
versatility, milk peptides are regarded as greatly important components for 
health promoting foods or pharmaceutical applications. Milk and colostrum of 
bovine and other dairy species are considered as the most important source of 
natural bioactive components. Over the past a few decades, major advances and 
developments have been achieved on the science, technology and commercial 
applications of bioactive components which are present naturally in the milk. 
Although the majority of published works are associated with the search of 
bioactive peptides in bovine milk samples, some of them are involved in the 
investigation of ovine or caprine milk. The advent of functional foods has been 
facilitated by increasing scientific knowledge about the metabolic and genomic 
effects of diet and specific dietary components on human health.

Hong Kong is among the first few cities in Asia to have implemented early 
intervention for psychosis in 2001. Substantial changes in psychosis service 
have since taken place. We reviewed available outcome data in Hong Kong, with 
reference to the philosophy of early intervention in psychosis, discussing 
experience and lessons learned from the implementation process, and future 
opportunities and challenges. Data accumulated in the past decade provided 
evidence for the benefits and significance of early intervention programmes: 
patients under the care of early intervention service showed improved 
functioning, milder symptoms, and fewer hospitalizations and suicides. Early 
intervention is more cost-effective compared with standard care. Stigma and 
misconception remains an issue, and public awareness campaigns are underway. In 
recent years, a critical mass is being formed, and Hong Kong has witnessed the 
unfolding of public service extension, new projects and organizations, and 
increasing interest from the community. Several major platforms are in place for 
coherent efforts, including the public Early Assessment Service for Young people 
with psychosis (EASY) programme, the Psychosis Studies and Intervention (PSI) 
research unit, the independent Hong Kong Early Psychosis Intervention Society 
(EPISO), the Jockey Club Early Psychosis (JCEP) project, and the postgraduate 
Psychological Medicine (Psychosis Studies) programme. The first decade of early 
intervention work has been promising; consolidation and further development is 
needed on many fronts of research, service and education.

[Survival Analysis Three-year Follow-up of Pacients with Head and Neck Cancer].

[Article in Czech]

Malá E, Vejražková E, Vošmik M, Novosad J, Sobotka L.

BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck cancer are predominantnly at the risk 
for malnutrition. Monitoring of nutritional status and pre-treatment variables 
can favorably observe many prognostic indicators for overall survival in head 
and neck cancer before and during oncological treatment up to three years in 
head and neck cancer pacients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 726 patients diagnosed head and neck cancer patients 
with curative intent, were collected data according to the monitoring scheme of 
observation. As a clinical important of uninteded weight loss was defined weight 
loss 10% in input (T0). Differences in groups were analysed by Coxs regression 
with adjustments for important demografic and tumor-related data.
RESULTS: The acceptance of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was a key 
factor for less complications and to improve tolerance of anticancer treatment. 
Men-smokers have the highest risk of cardiovascular mortality. Men-stop-smokers 
have the most significant life extension of 11 to 22 months; p < 0.007. 
Men-non-smokers have a life extension of 15 to 23 months (p < 0.005) and having 
its lowest cardiovascular mortality (11%). Women tolerate cancer better, have 
minor subjective complaints and a lower number of complications but 
significantly higher consumption of antidepressants (p < 0.003). While men have 
higher analgesic consumption (p < 0.001). Weight loss > 10% significantly 
correlates with the clinical manifestations of malnutrition and is associated 
with an increase in complications and mortality dependent cancer (p < 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Consistent assessment of nutritional status with early intervention 
is considered as an essential part of comprehensive anticancer treatment. An 
independent risk factor for cancer-dependent mortality is considered weight loss 
of > 5% with a BMI < 21 at time T0 or weight loss > 10% weight T0 in BMI 21- 29 
and continuing weight loss to T12 and also BMI 30. The highest-risk profile has 
a male sex-smoker, age > 63, hypopharyngeal carcinoma, stage III- IV, weight 
loss of > 10% and non-acceptance of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Another 
long-term observation of monitored nutritional status with intervention, 
clinical status and quality of life are needed.

BACKGROUND: High-quality epidemiological studies evaluating the burden of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide are lacking. We compared the burden of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis in each country to the overall global burden and 
assessed the equality of cutaneous leishmaniasis burden across different 
countries and regions.
METHODS: Data were extracted from scientific literature, hospital sources, 
country reports, and WHO sources on the prevalence of sequalae of both acute and 
chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevalence data were combined with a disability 
weight to yield years lived with disability. Disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) are a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost (or 
mortality, assumed to be zero). We compared DALYs due to cutaneous leishmaniasis 
for 152 countries using standard Z score analysis with Bonferroni correction 
(p<0·003) and generation of Lorenz curves with a Gini coefficient.
FINDINGS: In 2013, the global mean age-standardised DALYs for cutaneous 
leishmaniasis was 0·58 per 100 000 people. Nine countries had significantly 
greater DALYs from cutaneous leishmaniasis than the mean: Afghanistan (87·0), 
Sudan (20·2), Syria (9·2), Yemen (6·2), Iraq (6·0), Burkina Faso (4·8), Bolivia 
(4·6), Haiti (4·1), and Peru (4·0). The Gini coefficient was 0·89. Andean Latin 
America, North Africa and Middle East, western sub-Saharan Africa, and south 
Asia had the highest DALYs from cutaneous leishmaniasis. Among males, Palestine 
had the highest incidence rates (616·2 cases per 100 000 people) followed by 
Afghanistan (566·4), Syria (357·1), and Nicaragua (354·8). Among females, 
Afghanistan had the highest incidence rates (623·9) followed by Syria (406·3), 
Palestine (222·1), and Nicaragua (180·8). Similar proportions of males and 
females had cutaneous leishmaniasis in most countries with a high incidence.
INTERPRETATION: The burden from cutaneous leishmaniasis mainly falls on 
countries in Africa and the Middle East. Global and national data on the burden 
of cutaneous leishmaniasis disease are pivotal to promote field studies and 
initiate behavioural change.
