BACKGROUND: The unfair distribution and delivery of health-care resources have 
been recognized as a problem in the worldwide. In the past 18 years, Turkey has 
undergone rapid social, cultural, and economic changes. The lifestyle and 
dietary habits of its people have also been changing, and the rates of diabetes, 
obesity, cancer, and other chronic diseases have increased dramatically over the 
past two decades. The health transformation program (HTP) has improved the 
Turkish health-care system since 2003. The main goal of HTP was to progress 
government, to provide equality between citizens, to give satisfaction to users 
and providers, and to subsidise the health-care system in Turkey.
AIM: The aim of this study is to assess health-care services and health care 
quality delivery in the Republic of Turkey with special emphasis on governmental 
hospitals, university hospitals, primary healthcare centers (PHC) and to make 
comparison with low-, medium- and high-income countries.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, descriptive study. The ministry of health 
Annual Reports, websites of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), The World 
Fact Book, organization for economic cooperation and development report, 
Compendium of Health Statistics, the Google engine, and PubMed were searched for 
information about Turkey's health-care system and its history. Papers and 
websites in English were evaluated. There was no restriction on types of 
articles and sources.
RESULTS: Turkey has made outstanding reforms in health status in the last two 
decades, especially after the implementation of the HTP. The doctor's perception 
has more influence regarding consultation length and visit than the patient's. 
The results of consultations in volunteer practices in Istanbul showed that the 
mean and SD of the consultation length for the whole sample of 360 patients was 
7.95 ± 4.38, (with range = 3-25 min). Consultation time has been affected by the 
patients' diseases, genders that women got longer consultation time, medical 
practices at the urban or rural areas, and ages which older patients required 
longer consultation time. The current study revealed that increasing doctor's 
workload leads to decrease the length of consultations. Moreover, average life 
expectancy reached 75.3 for men and 80.7 for women in 2015. The infant mortality 
rate decreased to 10.7/1000 live births in 2015, down from 117.5 in 1980. The 
leading causes of death are diseases of the circulatory system followed by 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The Turkish health system and health-care delivery have been 
improved over the last decade. Still far from perfect, there is a particular 
planning to increase medical workforce in PHC including well-trained staffs for 
a specific area. An urgent need is to acquire more accurate and reliable data 
from hospital and PHC centers in Turkey. Additional some attempts should be made 
to assess quality of healthcare in relation to services and process.

First described almost two decades ago, the pioneering yeast models of 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's diseases, have become well-established research tools, providing 
both basic mechanistic insights as well as a platform for the development of 
therapeutic agents. These maladies are associated with the formation of 
aggregative amyloid protein structures showing common characteristics, such as 
the assembly of soluble oligomeric species, binding of indicative dyes, and 
apoptotic cytotoxicity. The canonical yeast models have recently been expanded 
by the establishment of a model for type II diabetes, a non-neurological 
amyloid-associated disease. While these model systems require the exogenous 
expression of mammalian proteins in yeast, an additional amyloid-associated 
disease model, comprising solely mutations of endogenous yeast genes, has been 
recently described. Mutated in the adenine salvage pathway, this yeast model 
exhibits adenine accumulation, thereby recapitulating adenine inborn error of 
metabolism disorders. Moreover, in line with the recent extension of the amyloid 
hypothesis to include metabolite amyloids, in addition to protein-associated 
ones, the intracellular assembly of adenine amyloid-like structures has been 
demonstrated using this yeast model. In this review, we describe currently 
available yeast models of diverse amyloid-associated disorders, as well as their 
impact on our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribution to future 
potential drug development.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy in the elderly. How much is it safe and 
beneficial?

Heart failure is a widespread disease in the western world whose incidence and 
prevalence are constantly increasing, mainly involving the more advanced age 
groups. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown able to reduce 
sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and 
reduced ejection fraction. Elderly patients are generally under-represented in 
the clinical trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CRT and, chiefly, of 
implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). The simultaneous presence of 
confounding factors such as co-morbidities, polypharmacy, changes in cognitive 
status, frailty, are the most important causes for the exclusion of subjects of 
advanced age from RCTs on the ICD or CRT implant. Current guidelines do not 
suggest any upper age limit for ICD and CRT but recommend avoiding their use in 
frail older patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Data from the 
literature show that CRT has equal dignity in both the elderly and the young, in 
fostering effective functional and morphological improvements, also suggesting 
that, in older patients, CRT-D may have little practical value compared to CRT-P 
given the low incidence of arrhythmic death. Nevertheless, it is necessary to 
develop RCTs that consider aspects of the elderly patient in relation to CRT 
such as functional, cognitive and nutritional status.

The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations recognize the 
importance of making progress in the eradication and treatment of sexually 
transmitted deceases (STD). STD are among the most widespread diseases in the 
world and have the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study 
explored the associations between the allocation of the development assistance 
for health (DAH) in 54 African countries and key development indicators - STD 
incidence, Gross Domestic Product per capita, health expenditure, and life 
expectancy at birth. It employed descriptive statistical methods, the matrix 
scatter plot analysis and the Pearson correlation test for this purpose. The 
findings indicated that there was a considerable increase in the volume of the 
DAH given to control and prevent STD in Africa over the period of 2002-2011. A 
statistically significant positive association was detected between the STD 
incidence and the health aid allocations. At the same time, the imbalance in the 
distribution of the health aid between the major and minor aid recipients in the 
continent increased. The study concludes by discussing policy implications that 
can be drawn from these findings.

Advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis with 
median life expectancy of approximately 1 year. Overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor 
cells and PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells has been associated with poorer 
prognosis, more advanced disease and higher recurrence rates in HCC. Monoclonal 
antibodies against PD-1 have demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with 
solid tumors, including HCC. Tislelizumab, an investigational, humanized IgG4 
monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity for PD-1, has 
demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in HCC. Here we describe a 
head-to-head Phase III study comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
tislelizumab with sorafenib as first-line treatment in unresectable HCC.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this chapter is to highlight current 
recommendations regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and post-polypectomy 
surveillance colonoscopy in older adults and to review the available literature 
in order to help inform decision-making in this age group.
RECENT FINDINGS: Age is a risk factor for CRC; however, older adults with a 
history of prior screening are at lower risk for CRC compared to those who have 
never been screened. Decision-making for CRC screening and post-polypectomy 
surveillance colonoscopy in older adults is complex and several factors 
including age, screening history, comorbidities, functional status, bowel 
preparation, prior experiences, preferences, and barriers need to be considered 
when weighing risks and benefits. Recent guidelines have started to incorporate 
life expectancy and prior screening history into their recommendations; however, 
how to incorporate these factors into actual clinical practice is less clear. 
There are limited data on the relative benefits of screening and surveillance in 
older adults and therefore, at this time, decision-making should be 
individualized and incorporate patient preferences in addition to medical 
factors.

Derived from the Greek 'schizo' (splitting) and 'phren' (mind) with the term 
first coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1908, schizophrenia is a functional 
psychotic disorder characterized by the presence of delusional beliefs, 
hallucinations, and disturbances in thought, perception, and behavior. 
Traditionally, symptoms have been divided into two main categories: positive 
symptoms, which include hallucinations, delusions, and formal thought disorders, 
and negative symptoms such as anhedonia, poverty of speech, and lack of 
motivation. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is clinical, made exclusively 
after obtaining a full psychiatric history and excluding other causes of 
psychosis. Risk factors include birthing complications, the season of birth, 
severe maternal malnutrition, maternal influenza in pregnancy, family history, 
childhood trauma, social isolation, cannabis use, minority ethnicity, and 
urbanization. Due to its relative complexity and heterogeneity, the etiology and 
pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Despite a low 
prevalence, schizophrenia's global burden of disease is immense. Over half of 
the patients have significant co-morbidities, both psychiatric and 
medical, making it one of the leading causes of disability 
worldwide. The diagnosis correlates with a 20% reduction in life expectancy, 
with up to 40% of deaths attributed to suicide.

Peripheral nerve injury can vary wildly in severity and presentation, ranging 
from mild soreness to severe muscle weakness. Axillary nerve injuries typically 
respond well to conservative management, though a surgical intervention may be 
required. Failure to accurately diagnose and manage patients may lead to 
life-long disability that can affect the overall quality of life. While axillary 
nerve lesions are somewhat rare, they should be considered when patients present 
with shoulder weakness and sensory loss. Anatomic Course The axillary nerve 
diverges from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus anterior to the 
subscapularis muscle, running posterior to the axillary artery. It then travels 
inferior to the glenohumeral joint capsule and passes through the quadrangular 
space with the posterior humeral circumflex artery. The axillary nerve proceeds 
to split into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior division supplies 
motor innervation to the anterior and middle heads of the deltoid. The posterior 
division provides motor innervation to the posterior deltoid and teres minor 
before eventually terminating as the superior lateral cutaneous nerve and 
innervating the lateral shoulder. The axillary nerve is a bilateral upper 
extremity peripheral nerve and receives significant contributions from C5 and 
minor contributions from C6. Functional Anatomy As stated above, the axillary 
nerve innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. The deltoid muscle, 
divided into three parts, performs and assists in a variety of actions. The 
primary function of the deltoid muscle is glenohumeral abduction, performed by 
the middle muscle belly. The anterior muscle belly assists in glenohumeral 
flexion and internal rotation. The posterior muscle belly assists in 
glenohumeral extension and external rotation. The teres minor functions in 
glenohumeral external rotation. The deltoid and teres minor stabilize the 
glenohumeral joint, with the teres minor contributing a greater role as a part 
of the glenohumeral rotator cuff. Lastly, the axillary nerve transmits afferent 
sensory input from the lateral shoulder. Several studies have claimed the 
axillary nerve innervates the long head of the triceps brachii. Still, a recent 
cadaver study by Wade et al. showed no axillary nerve innervation to the triceps 
brachii.

Aim: The approved indication for denosumab (120 mg) was expanded in 2018 to 
include skeletal-related event (SRE) prevention in patients with multiple 
myeloma (MM). Therefore, a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing 
denosumab with zoledronic acid (ZA) for SRE prevention in patients with MM from 
the national healthcare system perspective in a representative sample of 
European countries: Austria, Belgium, Greece, and Italy. Methods: The XGEVA 
global economic model for patients with MM was used to calculate incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for denosumab vs ZA over a lifetime horizon. 
Clinical inputs were derived from the denosumab vs ZA randomized, phase 3 study 
("20090482") in patients newly-diagnosed with MM, and comprised real-world 
adjusted SRE rates, serious adverse event (SAE) rates, treatment duration, dose 
intensity, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Economic 
inputs comprised country-specific denosumab and ZA acquisition and 
administration costs, SRE and SAE management costs, and discount rates. Health 
utility decrements associated with MM disease progression, SRE and SAE 
occurrence, and route of administration were included. Results: Estimated ICERs 
(cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) for denosumab vs ZA in 
Austria, Belgium, Greece, and Italy were €26,294, €17,737, €6,982, and €27,228, 
respectively. Using 1-3 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per QALY 
as willingness to pay thresholds, denosumab was 69-94%, 84-96%, 79-96%, and 
50-92% likely to be cost-effective vs ZA, respectively. Limitations: Economic 
inputs were derived from various sources, and time to event inputs were 
extrapolated from 20090482 study data. Conclusions: Denosumab is cost-effective 
vs ZA for SRE prevention in patients with MM in Austria, Belgium, Greece, and 
Italy, based on often-adopted World Health Organization thresholds. This 
conclusion is robust to changes in model parameters and assumptions. 
Cost-effectiveness estimates varied across the four countries, reflecting 
differences in healthcare costs and national economic evaluation guidelines.

Quantifying the value of investment in medical research can inform 
decision-making on the prioritisation of research programmes. Existing 
methodologies to estimate the rate of return of medical research are 
inappropriate for early-phase translational research due to censoring of health 
benefits and time lags. A strategy to improve the process of translational 
research for patient benefit has been initiated as part of the UK National 
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) investment in Biomedical Research Centres 
(BRCs) in England. By providing a platform for partnership between universities, 
NHS trusts and industry, successful BRCs should reduce time lags within 
translational research whilst also providing an impetus for local economic 
growth through industry collaboration. We present a novel contribution in the 
assessment of early-phase biomedical research by estimating the impact of the 
Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (OxBRC) on income and job creation following 
the initial NIHR investment. We adopt a macroeconomic assessment approach using 
Input-Output Analysis to estimate the value of medical research in terms of 
income and job creation during the early pathway towards translational 
biomedical research. Inter-industry linkages are assessed by building a model 
economy for the South East England region to estimate the return on investment 
of the OxBRC. The results from the input-output model estimate that the return 
on investment in biomedical research within the OxBRC is 46%. Each £1 invested 
in the OxBRC generates an additional £0.46 through income and job creation 
alone. Multiplicative employment effects following a marginal investment in the 
OxBRC of £98m during the period 2007-2017 result in an estimated additional 196 
full time equivalent positions being created within the local economy on top of 
direct employment within OxBRC. Results from input-output analyses can be used 
to inform the prioritisation of biomedical research programmes when compared 
against national minimum thresholds of investment.

Latinx in the United States have greater life expectancy than other groups, in 
spite of their socioeconomic and psychosocial disadvantage. This phenomenon has 
been described as the Latinx health paradox. This investigation observed the 
interplay of cultural processes and social networks to shed light on this 
paradox. Latina (N = 26) and White-European (N = 24) mothers wore a digital 
recorder as they went about their daily lives. Four conversation styles were 
characterized from the recordings to measure the mothers' quality of their 
conversations (small talk and substantive conversations) within different social 
networks (with the father vs. other adults). As a positive indicator of 
well-being, laughter was assessed during the conversations. Results demonstrated 
that Latina mothers tend to laugh more than White-European mothers; and that 
this relation is mediated by substantive conversations with others. This 
suggests that Latinas' cultural processes afford meaningful conversations, which 
relates to more behavioral laughter, a process that may have positive 
implications on well-being.

Anemia is a common finding in patients with heart failure (HF). The cause for 
anemia is multifactorial, with iron deficiency being the most common cause. 
Anemia with HF is an established predictor of morbidity and mortality. Iron 
deficiency in systolic HF, even without anemia, has been associated with 
increased mortality, increased hospitalizations, and decreased functional 
capacity and quality of life measures. Data from several randomized controlled 
trials and meta-analyses of iron deficiency and systolic HF show a beneficial 
effect for intravenous (IV) iron in terms of quality of life and functional 
capacity (improvements in 6-min walk test, and improvements in New York Heart 
Association functional class), as well as decreased hospitalizations for HF and 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality rates. Limited evidence exists for a 
beneficial effect of IV iron in diastolic dysfunction. Patients with symptomatic 
systolic HF should undergo an anemia diagnostic work-up. When iron deficiency 
(defined as ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin 100-299 ng/mL and transferrin 
saturation <20%) is present, current evidence supports treating HF patients with 
iron deficiency with IV iron.

Climate change significantly modifies terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation 
activity, yet little is known about how climate change and ozone pollution 
interact to affect forest health. Here we compared the trends of two metrics 
widely used to protect forests against negative impacts of ozone pollution, the 
AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone over Threshold of 40 ppb) which only depends on surface 
air ozone concentrations, and the POD (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose) which relies on 
the amount of ozone uptaken by plants through stomata. Using a chemistry 
transport model, driven by anthropogenic emission inventories, we found that 
European-averaged ground-level ozone concentrations significantly declined 
(-1.6%) over the time period 2000-2014, following successful control strategies 
to reduce the ozone precursors emission; as a consequence, the AOT40 metric 
declined (-22%). In contrast, climate change increased both growing season 
length (~7 days/decade) and stomatal conductance and thus enhanced the stomatal 
ozone uptake by forests (5.9%), leading to an overall increase of potential 
ozone damage on plants, despite the reduction in ozone concentrations. Our 
results suggest that stomatal-flux based strategies of forest protection against 
ozone in a changing climate require a proper consideration of the duration of 
the growing season with a better estimation of start and end of the growing 
season.

BACKGROUND: Evidence of quality of life implications of asthma attacks are 
limited, particularly when measured on a utility scale, which enables 
calculating Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and comparisons with other 
health conditions and services. Therefore, this study sought to estimate the 
utility loss associated with an asthma-related crisis event (accident and 
emergency (A&E) attendance or hospital admission).
METHODS: Participants were recruited in a cohort study from A&E and hospital 
admissions at three UK hospitals. They completed the EuroQol-5 Dimensions 
5-Level (EQ-5D-5 L), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Time trade-off 
(TTO), and peak flow and symptom diary over 8 weeks, where three different 
methods (EQ-5D-5 L, AQLQ, and TTO), were used to estimate utilities. The mean 
difference between two time points were estimated using the Wilcoxon signed rank 
test.
RESULTS: From baseline to week 8, mean increases (95% CI) were estimated to be 
0.086 (0.019-0.153), 0.154 (0.112-0.196) and 0.132 (0.063-0.201) for EQ-5D-5 L, 
AQL-5D (preference-based measure derived from AQLQ), and TTO respectively over 
8 weeks (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Asthma crisis events are estimated to be associated with a mean 
utility loss of between 0.086 and 0.132. The utility decrement can be used to 
assign values to asthma-related crisis events, which can enhance economic 
evaluations.

BACKGROUND: A resilient health system is inevitable in attaining the 
health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One way of strengthening 
health systems is improving the coverage of public health laws for better health 
governance. The aim of this study is to describe the public health law situation 
in the Western Pacific Region and analyse the association of public health law 
coverage with health-related SDGs statistics.
METHODS: A total of 33 Western Pacific countries were selected and analysed 
using a multi-group ecological study design. Public health law coverage was 
measured from April 2013 to October 2016 based on the public health law coverage 
module in the 'Tool to Assess Health Law' developed by the WHO Western Pacific 
Regional Office and Asian Institute for Bioethics and Health Law of Yonsei 
University. The health-related SDGs status were examined using health statistics 
data from World Health Statistics 2017 and 2018 by WHO and SDGs index scores of 
previous research.
RESULTS: Countries with high public health law coverage were Vietnam, Republic 
of Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Low coverage countries were mainly Pacific 
Island countries. High public health law coverage issues were health care 
organisation, communicable diseases, and substance abuse, whereas those of low 
coverage were human reproduction, family health, and oral health. Public health 
law coverage was associated with health-related SDGs statistics such as life 
expectancy at birth (r = 0.47, p = 0.03), health life expectancy at birth 
(r = 0.47, p = 0.04), health-related SDGs index (r = 0.43, p = 0.05). Among the 
SDG 3 indicators, maternal mortality ratio (r = - 0.53, p = 0.01), neonatal 
mortality rate (r = - 0.44, p = 0.02), new HIV infections (r = 0.78, p = 0.04), 
total alcohol consumption (r = 0.45, p = 0.02), adolescent birth rate 
(r = - 0.40, p = 0.04), UHC service coverage index (r = 0.50, p = 0.02), and IHR 
average core capacity score (r = 0.54, p = 0.004) were statistically meaningful. 
However, there was no association of public health law coverage with health 
statistics in other SDGs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study proved the importance of public health law in supporting 
the attainment of health-related SDGs. These results should be used as the basis 
for review and action at country level in improving public health law for better 
health systems, consequently achieving health-related SDGs.

1997-2016.

BACKGROUND: Although estimates of socioeconomic mortality disparities in Germany 
exist, the trends in these disparities since the 1990s are still unknown. This 
study examines mortality trends across socioeconomic groups since the late 1990s 
among retired German men aged 65 and above.
METHODS: Large administrative data sets were used to estimate mortality among 
retired German men, grouped according to their working-life biographies. The 
data covered the years 1997-2016 and included more than 84.1 million 
person-years and 4.3 million deaths. Individual pension entitlements served as a 
measure of lifetime income. Changes in total life expectancy at age 65 over time 
were decomposed into effects of group-specific mortality improvements and 
effects of compositional change.
RESULTS: Over the two decades studied, male mortality declined in all income 
groups in both German regions. As mortality improved more rapidly among higher 
status groups, the social gradient in mortality widened. Since 1997, the 
distribution of pension entitlements of retired East German men has shifted 
substantially downwards. As a result, the impact of the most disadvantaged group 
on total mortality has increased and has partly attenuated the overall 
improvement.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that socioeconomic deprivation has 
substantial effects on levels of mortality in postreunification Germany. While 
East German retirees initially profited from the transition to the West German 
pension system, subsequent cohorts had to face challenges associated with the 
transition to the market economy. The results suggest that postreunification 
unemployment and status decline had delayed effects on old-age mortality in East 
Germany.

BACKGROUND: The clinical course of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) varies from 
asymptomatic nonprogressive to aggressive disease, with up to one in four 
patients manifesting ESRD within 20 years of diagnosis. Although some studies 
have suggested that mortality appears to be increased in IgAN, such studies 
lacked matched controls and did not report absolute risk.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Sweden, involving 
patients with biopsy-verified IgAN diagnosed in 1974-2011; main outcome measures 
were death and ESRD. Using data from three national registers, we linked 3622 
patients with IgAN with 18,041 matched controls; we also conducted a sibling 
analysis using 2773 patients with IgAN with 6210 siblings and a spousal analysis 
that included 2234 pairs.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.6 years, 577 (1.1%) patients with IgAN 
died (10.67 per 1000 person-years) compared with 2066 deaths (0.7%) in the 
reference population during a median follow-up of 14.1 years (7.45 per 1000 
person-years). This corresponded to a 1.53-fold increased risk and an absolute 
excess mortality of 3.23 per 1000 person-years (equaling one extra death per 310 
person-years) and a 6-year reduction in median life expectancy. Similar 
increases in risk were seen in comparisons with siblings and spouses. IgAN was 
associated with one extra case of ESRD per 54 person-years. Mortality preceding 
ESRD was not significantly increased compared with controls, spouses, or 
siblings. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between patients with 
IgAN-associated ESRD and patients with ESRD from other causes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IgAN have an increased mortality compared with 
matched controls, with one extra death per 310 person-years and a 6-year 
reduction in life expectancy.

Prostate cancer: molecular and cellular mechanisms and their implications in 
therapy resistance and disease progression.

Prostate cancer is among the most common malignancies in Western countries, and 
its incidence is rapidly rising in Asia where it was traditionally considered an 
uncommon tumor. Our understanding of the disease and management strategies 
continue to evolve. The first revolution of its treatment was in the 1940s when 
hormonal therapy was used to treat patients. The discovery of prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) and the subsequent adoption of widespread PSA screening have made 
it possible to diagnose the disease early, but it was not until recently that 
the field realized that we had been overdiagnosing and overtreating a large 
number of men with indolent diseases that will not impact their quality of life 
or life expectancy. Distinguishing indolent tumors from aggressive ones remains 
a challenge, although recent advances in multiparametric MRI have given 
clinicians more confidence in choosing men for active surveillance. However, 
more need to be done to fundamentally understand the molecular and cellular 
bases that determine the biologic behavior of each of the tumors.

BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTM) is a relatively common entity 
in the general population. PTM is often asymptomatic and is detected 
incidentally during the histopathological examination of thyroidectomy specimens 
from operations because of benign thyroid disease.
AIMS: The aims of the study are to determine the incidence of incidental 
papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (IPTMs) in our center, to examine the 
clinicopathologic characteristics of these tumors, and to present our 
experiences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 827 patients who underwent 
thyroidectomy operation in our center between January 2013 and June 2017 and 
were examined histopathologically in the Pathology Clinic. Patients' demographic 
characteristics, preoperative diagnoses, operative procedure, histopathological 
findings, and postoperative prognostic indexes are presented.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of the 827 patients, 138 (16.6%) were diagnosed with a 
malignancy. Of these, 124 were papillary carcinoma, 5 were follicular carcinoma, 
4 were lymphoma, 2 were medullary carcinoma, 2 were anaplastic carcinoma, and 1 
was poorly differentiated carcinoma. The IPTM incidence rate was 8.01%; the 
multifocality and bilaterality rates were 23.3% and 13.3%, respectively. In 
98.3% of IPTM cases, total thyroidectomies were performed, and in 1.7% of cases, 
subtotal thyroidectomy was performed followed by complementary thyroidectomy. No 
relapse or metastasis was detected in any of these cases. A careful 
histopathological examination of the thyroidectomy specimen is essential because 
IPTM is frequently skipped in fine needle aspiration cytology. We consider it 
best to perform total thyroidectomies because bilaterality and multifocality 
rates are high in IPTM. Long-term life expectancy in these tumors is quite good.

In its early stages multiple system atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative movement 
disorder, can be difficult to differentiate from idiopathic Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and emphasis has been put on identifying premotor symptoms to allow for 
its early identification. The occurrence of vegetative symptoms in addition to 
motor impairment, such as orthostatic hypotension and neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction, enable the clinical diagnosis in the advanced stages of the 
disease. Usually with further disease progression, laryngeal abnormalities 
become clinically evident and can manifest in laryngeal stridor due to impaired 
vocal fold motion, such as vocal fold abduction restriction, mostly referred to 
as vocal fold paresis, or paradoxical vocal fold adduction during inspiration. 
While the pathogenesis of laryngeal stridor is discussed controversially, its 
occurrence is clearly associated with reduced life expectancy. Before the 
clinical manifestation of laryngeal dysfunction however, abnormal vocal fold 
motion can already be seen in patients that might not yet fulfill the diagnostic 
criteria of MSA. In this article we summarize the current literature on 
pharyngolaryngeal findings in MSA and report preliminary findings from a pilot 
study investigating eight consecutive MSA patients. Patients showed varying 
speech abnormalities. Only 2/8 patients exhibited laryngeal stridor. However, 
during FEES, all patients presented with irregular arytenoid cartilages 
movements and vocal fold abduction restriction. 3/8 showed vocal fold fixation 
and 1/8 paradoxical vocal fold motion. All patients presented with oropharyngeal 
dysphagia, 5/8 with penetration or aspiration events. We suggest that specific 
abnormal vocal fold motion can help identifying MSA patients and may allow for 
delimiting this disorder from idiopathic PD. These findings therefore may serve 
as a novel clinical biomarker for MSA. Based on the available data and our 
preliminary clinical experience we developed a standardized easy-to-implement 
task-protocol to be performed during flexible endoscopic evaluation of 
swallowing (FEES) for detection of MSA-related pharyngolaryngeal movement 
disorders. Furthermore, we initiated a prospective study to evaluate the 
diagnostic utility of this protocol.

Purpose: To perform a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
isolated recurrent tumor re-irradiation with carbon-ion radiotherapy (RT). 
Methods and Materials: The inclusion criteria were clinically proven recurrent 
tumors, measurable by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, 
patients ≥ 16 years old, performance status scores between 0 and 2, isolated 
tumor at a previously irradiated site, and a life expectancy > 6 months. The 
exclusion criteria were tumor invasion into the gastrointestinal tract or a 
major blood vessel, uncontrolled infection, early recurrence (<3 months), and
