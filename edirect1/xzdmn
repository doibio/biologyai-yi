BACKGROUND: Transport-related injuries (TIs) are a substantial public health 
concern for all regions of the world. The present study quantified the burden of 
TIs and deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) in 2017 by sex and age.
METHODS: TIs and deaths were estimated by age, sex, country, and year using 
Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) and DisMod-MR 2.1. Disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), which quantify the total burden of years lost due to 
premature death or disability, were also estimated per 100000 population. All 
estimates were reported along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs).
RESULTS: In 2017, there were 5.5 million (UI 4.9-6.2) transport-related incident 
cases in the EMR - a substantial increase from 1990 (2.8 million; UI 2.5-3.1). 
The age-standardized incidence rate for the EMR in 2017 was 787 (UI 705.5-876.2) 
per 100000, which has not changed significantly since 1990 (-0.9%; UI -4.7 to 
3). These rates differed remarkably between countries, such that Oman (1303.9; 
UI 1167.3-1441.5) and Palestine (486.5; UI 434.5-545.9) had the highest and 
lowest age-standardized incidence rates per 100000, respectively. In 2017, there 
were 185.3 thousand (UI 170.8-200.6) transport-related fatalities in the EMR - a 
substantial increase since 1990 (140.4 thousand; UI 118.7-156.9). The 
age-standardized death rate for the EMR in 2017 was 29.5 (UI 27.1-31.9) per 
100000, which was 30.5% lower than that found in 1990 (42.5; UI 36.8-47.3). In 
2017, Somalia (54; UI 30-77.4) and Lebanon (7.1; UI 4.8-8.6) had the highest and 
lowest age-standardized death rates per 100,000, respectively. The 
age-standardised DALY rate for the EMR in 2017 was 1,528.8 (UI 1412.5-1651.3) 
per 100000, which was 34.4% lower than that found in 1990 (2,331.3; UI 
1,993.1-2,589.9). In 2017, the highest DALY rate was found in Pakistan (3454121; 
UI 2297890- 4342908) and the lowest was found in Bahrain (8616; UI 7670-9751).
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that while road traffic has become 
relatively safer (measured by deaths and DALYs per 100000 population), the 
number of transport-related fatalities in the EMR is growing and needs to be 
addressed urgently.

We present an extension of a generalized finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann 
(FDPB) continuum solvation model based on a self-consistent reaction field 
treatment to nonaqueous solvents. Implementation and reparametrization of the 
cavitation, dispersion, and structural (CDS) effects nonelectrostatic model are 
presented in CRYSTAL, with applications to both finite and infinite periodic 
systems. For neutral finite systems, computed errors with respect to available 
experimental data on free energies of solvation of 2523 solutes in 91 solvents, 
as well as 144 transfer energies from water to 14 organic solvents are on par 
with the reference SM12 solvation model for which the CDS parameters have been 
developed. Calculations performed on a TiO2 anatase surface and compared to 
VASPsol data revealed an overall very good agreement of computed solvation 
energies, surface energies, as well as band structure changes upon solvation in 
three different solvents, validating the general applicability of the 
reparametrized FDPB approach to neutral nonperiodic and periodic solutes in 
aqueous and nonaqueous solvents. For ionic species, while the reparametrized CDS 
model led to large errors on free energies of solvation of anions, addition of a 
corrective term based on Abraham's acidity of the solvent significantly improved 
the accuracy of the proposed continuum solvation model, leading to errors on 
aqueous pKa of a test set of 83 solutes divided by a factor of 4 compared to the 
reference solvation model based on density (SMD). Overall, therefore, these 
encouraging results demonstrate that the generalized FDPB continuum solvation 
model can be applied to a broad range of solutes in various solvents, ranging 
from finite neutral or charged solutes to extended periodic surfaces.

BACKGROUND: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a national vaccination program against herpes zoster in 
Norway.
METHODS: The model analyzed six vaccination scenarios that included the 
live-attenuated zoster vaccine under different target ages of vaccination (60, 
65, and 70 years) compared with no vaccination. A catch-up program implemented 
in the first year of the vaccination was included in three of the scenarios. The 
model followed the population of Norway over a 40-year time horizon to estimate 
costs and outcomes associated with vaccination. Immunization costs, costs 
related to herpes zoster (both healthcare sector and non-healthcasre sector), 
the quality of life gains due to avoided cases of herpes zoster, and 
quality-of-life losses due to vaccine-related adverse events were estimated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A national vaccination program would result in 
reduction of the number of herpes zoster cases and decreased burden of illness. 
Vaccinating adults at 65 years of age with catch-up up to 70 years in the first 
year of the program was the most cost-effective strategy with the incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained at NOK (Norwegian Krone) 245,459 from 
the societal perspective and NOK 248,637 from the health care system 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate global burden of refraction disorders by year, age, 
region, gender, socioeconomic status and other national characteristics in terms 
of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and prevalence from Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study 2019 and World Bank Open Data 2019.
METHODS: Global, regional, and national DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, 
age-standardized DALY and prevalence rates of refraction disorders were acquired 
from the GBD study 2019. Mobile cellular subscriptions, urban population, GDP 
per capita, access to electricity and total fertility rate were obtained from 
the World Bank to explore the factors that influenced the health burden of 
refraction disorders. Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression and multiple linear 
regression were performed to evaluate the associations between the health burden 
with socioeconomic levels and other national characteristics. Wilcoxon 
Signed-Rank Test was used to investigate the gender disparity.
RESULTS: Globally, age-standardized DALY rates of refraction disorders decreased 
from 88.9 (95% UI: 60.5-120.3) in 1990 to 81.5 (95% UI: 55.0-114.8) in 2019, and 
might fall to 73.16 (95% UI: 67.81-78.51) by 2050. Age-standardized prevalence 
rates would also reduce to 1830 (95% UI: 1700-1960) by 2050, from 2080 (95% UI: 
1870-2310) in 1990 to 1960 (95% UI: 1750-2180) in 2019. In low SDI region, 
age-standardized DALY rates (equation: Y = 114.05*X + 27.88) and prevalence 
rates (equation: Y = 3171.1*X + 403.2) were positively correlated with SDI in 
linear regression respectively. East Asia had the highest blindness rate caused 
by refraction disorders in terms of age-standardized DALY rates (11.20, 95% UI: 
7.38-16.36). Gender inequality was found among different age groups and SDI 
regions.
CONCLUSION: Health burden of refraction disorders decreased in recent years, and 
may continue to alleviate in the next three decades. Older ages, females and 
lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher refraction disorders 
health burden.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals and surrogate decision-makers often face 
the difficult decision of whether to initiate or withhold antibiotics from 
people with dementia who have developed a life-threatening infection after 
losing decisional capacity.
METHODS: We conducted a vignette-based survey among 1050 Quebec stakeholders 
(senior citizens, family caregivers, nurses and physicians; response rate 49.4%) 
to (1) assess their attitudes toward withholding antibiotics from people with 
dementia lacking decisional capacity; (2) compare attitudes between dementia 
stages and stakeholder groups; and (3) investigate other correlates of 
attitudes, including support for continuous deep sedation (CDS) and medical 
assistance in dying (MAID). The vignettes feature a woman moving along the 
dementia trajectory, who has refused in writing all life-prolonging 
interventions and explicitly requested that a doctor end her life when she no 
longer recognizes her loved ones. Two stages were considered after she had lost 
capacity: the advanced stage, where she likely has several more years to live, 
and the terminal stage, where she is close to death.
RESULTS: Support for withholding antibiotics ranged from 75% among seniors and 
caregivers at the advanced stage, to 98% among physicians at the terminal stage. 
Using the generalized estimating equation approach, we found stakeholder group, 
religiosity, and support for CDS and MAID, to be associated with attitudes 
toward antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance for healthcare professionals of 
discussing underlying values and treatment goals with people at an early stage 
of dementia and their relatives, to help them anticipate future care decisions 
and better prepare surrogates for their role. Findings also have implications 
for the scope of MAID laws, in particular in Canada where the extension of MAID 
to persons lacking decisional capacity is currently being considered.

BACKGROUND: Essential medicines lists (EMLs) are intended to reflect the 
priority health care needs of populations. We hypothesized that biologic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are underrepresented relative to 
conventional DMARDs in existing national EMLs. We aimed to survey the extent to 
which biologic DMARDs are included in EMLs, to determine country characteristics 
contributing to their inclusion or absence, and to contrast this with 
conventional DMARD therapies.
METHODS: We searched 138 national EMLs for 10 conventional and 14 biologic 
DMARDs used in the treatment of childhood rheumatologic diseases. Via regression 
modelling, we determined country characteristics accounting for differences in 
medicine inclusion between national EMLs.
RESULTS: Eleven countries (7.97%) included all 10 conventional DMARDs, 115 
(83.33%) ≥5, and all countries listed at least one. Gross domestic product (GDP) 
per capita was associated with the total number of conventional DMARDs included 
(β11.02 [95% CI 0.39, 1.66]; P = 0.00279). Among biologic DMARDs, 3 countries 
(2.2%) listed ≥10, 15 (10.9%) listed ≥5, and 47 (34.1%) listed at least one. 
Ninety-one (65.9%) of countries listed no biologic DMARDs. European region (β1 
1.30 [95% CI 0.08, 2.52]; P = 0.0367), life expectancy (β1-0.70 [95% CI -1.22, 
- 0.18]; P = 0.0085), health expenditure per capita (β1 1.83 [95% CI 1.24, 
2.42]; P < 0.001), and conventional DMARDs listed (β1 0.70 [95% CI 0.33, 1.07]; 
P < 0.001) were associated with the total number of biologic DMARDs included.
CONCLUSION: Biologic DMARDs are excluded from most national EMLs. By comparison, 
conventional DMARDs are widely included. Countries with higher health spending 
and longer life expectancy are more likely to list biologics.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a 2-year physical activity 
(PA) intervention combining family-based PA counselling and after-school 
exercise clubs in primary-school children compared to no intervention from an 
extended service payer's perspective.
METHODS: The participants included 506 children (245 girls, 261 boys) allocated 
to an intervention group (306 children, 60 %) and a control group (200 children, 
40 %). The children and their parents in the intervention group had six PA 
counselling visits, and the children also had the opportunity to participate in 
after-school exercise clubs. The control group received verbal and written 
advice on health-improving PA at baseline. A change in total PA over two years 
was used as the outcome measure. Intervention costs included those related to 
the family-based PA counselling, the after-school exercise clubs, and the 
parents' taking time off to travel to and participate in the counselling. The 
cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat 
principle. The costs per increased PA hour (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio, ICER) were based on net monetary benefit (NMB) regression adjusted for 
baseline PA and background variables. The results are presented with NMB and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Over two years, total PA increased on average by 108 h in the 
intervention group (95 % confidence interval [CI] from 95 to 121, p < 0.001) and 
decreased by 65.5 h (95 % CI from 81.7 to 48.3, p < 0.001) in the control group, 
the difference being 173.7 h. the incremental effectiveness was 87 (173/2) 
hours. For two years, the intervention costs were €619 without parents' time use 
costs and €860 with these costs. The costs per increased PA hour were €6.21 
without and €8.62 with these costs. The willingness to pay required for 95 % 
probability of cost-effectiveness was €14 and €19 with these costs. The 
sensitivity analyses revealed that the ICER without assuming this linear change 
in PA were €3.10 and €4.31.
CONCLUSIONS: The PA intervention would be cost-effective compared to no 
intervention among children if the service payer's willingness-to-pay for a 
1-hour increase in PA is €8.62 with parents' time costs.

BACKGROUND: People with mobility disabilities are likely to report limitations 
in community participation and social connectedness for a variety of reasons, 
including inaccessible physical environments, health issues, transportation 
barriers, and limited financial resources. Improving social connectedness is a 
public health issue and research shows its relation to overall health and life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to (1) assess social activity, 
isolation, and loneliness among people with mobility disabilities compared to 
those with non-mobility disabilities and (2) understand factors associated with 
social connectedness among people with mobility disabilities.
METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data 
from Wave 2 of the National Survey on Health and Disability (NSHD) to test for 
differences between adults age 18-64 with mobility disabilities (n = 621) and 
those with other disabilities (n = 1535), in addition to tests within the 
mobility disability group.
RESULTS: Adults with mobility disabilities were less likely than respondents 
from other disability groups to report feeling isolated (30.2% versus 35.2%), 
but these groups did not differ on measures of social activity or loneliness. 
Within the mobility disability group, being unemployed and in fair or poor 
health were predictive of greater loneliness, more isolation, and less 
satisfaction with social activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Social connectedness is an important public health issue. This 
research helps to inform service providers and medical professionals about the 
personal factors affecting social connectedness among people with mobility 
disabilities.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four different primary 
screening strategies: high-risk factor questionnaire (HRFQ) alone, single 
immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT), double iFOBT and HRFQ+double 
iFOBT for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening compared with no screening using the 
Markov model.
METHODS: Treeage Pro V.2011 software was used to simulate the Markov model. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was compared with the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, was used to reflect the cost-effectiveness 
of the CRC screening method. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were used for parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: All strategies had greater effectiveness because they had more 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than no screening. When the WTP was 
¥435 762/QALY, all screening strategies were cost-effective compared with no 
screening. The double iFOBT strategy was the best-buy option compared with all 
other strategies because it had the most QALYs and the least cost. One-way 
sensitivity analysis showed that the sensitivity of low-risk adenoma, compliance 
with colonoscopy and primary screening cost were the main influencing factors 
comparing single iFOBT, double iFOBT and HRFQ+double iFOBT with no screening. 
However, within the scope of this study, there was no fundamental impact on 
cost-effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when the WTP 
was ¥435 762/QALY, the probabilities of the cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curve with HRFQ alone, single iFOBT, double iFOBT and HRFQ+double iFOBT were 
0.0%, 5.3%, 69.3% and 25.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: All screening strategies for CRC were cost-effective compared with 
no screening strategy. Double iFOBT was the best-buy option compared with all 
other strategies. The significant influencing factors were the sensitivity of 
low-risk polyps, compliance with colonoscopy and cost of primary screening.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With improved life expectancy, preventing neurocognitive 
decline after cerebral radiotherapy is gaining more importance. Hippocampal 
damage has been considered the main culprit for cognitive deficits following 
conventional whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Here, we aimed to determine 
to which extent hippocampus-avoidance WBRT (HA-WBRT) can prevent hippocampal 
atrophy compared to conventional WBRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-five HA-WBRT and 48 WBRT patients were 
retrospectively selected, comprising a total of 544 contrast-enhanced 
T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies, longitudinally acquired within 
24 months before and 48 months after radiotherapy. HA-WBRT patients were treated 
analogously to the ongoing HIPPORAD-trial (DRKS00004598) protocol with 30 Gy in 
12 fractions and dose to 98% of the hippocampus ≤ 9 Gy and to 2% ≤ 17 Gy. WBRT 
was mainly performed with 35 Gy in 14 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. 
Anatomical images were segmented and the hippocampal volume was quantified using 
the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT), including neuroradiological expert 
review of the segmentations.
RESULTS: After statistically controlling for confounding variables such as age, 
gender, and total intracranial volume, hippocampal atrophy was found after both 
WBRT and HA-WBRT (p < 10-6). However, hippocampal decline across time following 
HA-WBRT was approximately three times lower than following conventional WBRT (p 
< 10-6), with an average atrophy of 3.1% versus 8.5% in the first 2 years after 
radiation therapy, respectively.
CONCLUSION: HA-WBRT is a therapeutic option for patients with multiple brain 
metastases, which can effectively and durably minimize hippocampal atrophy 
compared to conventional WBRT.

United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Malignant bowel obstruction is a common cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Many patients aren't 
suitable for, or decline, surgical decompression. The outcomes for this frail 
group of patients are not well characterized.
AIM: To evaluate survival outcomes of ovarian cancer patients who undergo 
non-surgical management of malignant bowel obstruction.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Online literature search of Pubmed, Embase and Medline libraries 
up until December 2020. Searching abstracts of scientific meetings, reference 
lists of included studies and contacting experts in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies that investigated non-surgical management of 
confirmed bowel obstruction in advanced ovarian cancer patients were included. 
All levels of evidence including RCTs, cohort studies and case-series if they 
included greater than 5 patients.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The studies were independently chosen by two 
reviewers who extracted and analyzed the data separately through OpenMeta 
Analyst software. Study quality was assessed using the JADAD score and the 
Newcastle Ottawa Score.
RESULTS: 24 studies met the eligibility criteria for the systematic review and 9 
for the meta-analysis. Median survival of patients managed non-surgically for 
bowel obstruction was 44 days (95% CI 38-49 days, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.128).
CONCLUSION: The quality of studies was relatively low, however the evidence 
shows that non-surgical management of bowel obstruction results in a short life 
expectancy but with controlled symptoms. Where quality of life is the main 
concern, this may be a feasible and effective strategy.

PURPOSE: This study explores the preferences of patients with cancer, family 
caregivers, and the general public regarding breaking bad news in an Ethiopian 
oncology setting.
METHODS: The study was conducted at Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Specialized 
Hospital. The sample consists of patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis, 
their family caregivers, and representatives from the general public with 150 
subjects per cohort. The study used a comparative cross-sectional design and 
multivariable data analysis.
RESULTS: The patients would like to be informed, which contradicts the 
preferences of family caregivers. This creates an ethical dilemma for staff in 
terms of how much they involve their patients in clinical decision making. The 
patients also indicate that information should not be withheld from them. By 
contrast, the general public prefers information about poor life expectancy to 
be communicated to family only, which may reflect a widespread public perception 
of cancer as a deadly disease.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the complexity of communication-related 
preferences concerning breaking bad news in oncology care in Ethiopia. It 
requires oncologists to probe patient attitudes before information disclosure to 
find a balance between involving patients in communication at the same time as 
keeping a constructive alliance with family caregivers.

For facilitating risk communication in clinical management, such a ratio-based 
measure becomes easier to understand if expressed as a loss of life expectancy. 
The cohort, consisting of 543,410 adults in Taiwan, was recruited between 1994 
and 2008. Health risks included lifestyle, biomarkers, and chronic diseases. A 
total of 18,747 deaths were identified. The Chiang's life table method was used 
to estimate a loss of life expectancy. We used Cox regression to calculate 
hazard ratios (HRs) for health risks. The increased mortality from 
cardio-metabolic risks such as high cholesterol (HR=1.10), hypertension 
(HR=1.48) or diabetes (HR=2.02) can be converted into a loss of 1.0, 4.4, and 
8.9 years in life expectancy, respectively. The top 20 of the 30 risks were 
associated with a loss of 4 to 10 years of life expectancy, with 70% of the 
cohort having at least two such risk factors. Smoking, drinking, and physical 
inactivity each had 5-7 years loss. Individuals with diabetes or an elevated 
white count had a loss of 7-10 years, while prolonged sitting, the most 
prevalent risk factor, had a loss of 2-4 years. Those with diabetes (8.9 years) 
and proteinuria (9.1 years) present at the same time showed a loss of 16.2 
years, a number close to the sum of each risk. Health risks, expressed as life 
expectancy loss, could facilitate risk communication. The paradigm shift in 
expressing risk intensity can help set public health priorities scientifically 
to promote a focus on the most important ones in primary care.

Climate change represents an unprecedented threat to global biodiversity and, 
for many species, gaps in our knowledge of their biology remain acute. Gaps in 
baseline knowledge, such as confirmed identifications (Linnean shortfalls) and 
adequate collections (Wallacean shortfalls), need to be minimized with new 
studies, since this is often critical for effective conservation. Despite the 
increase in scientific research on primates in the southwest of the Brazilian 
Amazon, little is known about the species Mico nigriceps (Ferrari & Lopes, 1992) 
Primates, Platirryni. In the current study, we sought to reduce the extent of 
the Wallacean shortfall for M. nigriceps, understand whether climate change 
represents a threat to the distribution of the species, and identify priority 
areas for its conservation. Accordingly, we provide 121 new records in 14 
locations, obtained directly from the field, and five from the literature. Using 
this, we carried out ecological niche modeling, to better understand how 
environmental suitability might limit the area occupied by the species. We then 
projected a distribution for 2070 with the SSP2-4.5 (more optimistic) and 
SSP5-8.5 (more pessimistic) scenarios. Our data confirmed the geographic 
distribution of the species as being restricted to headwaters of the 
Ji-Paraná/Machado river, but with a 400 km extension to the south. Under the 
modeled climate change scenarios, the area suitable for the species declines by 
21% under the most optimistic, and by 27% in the pessimistic, scenario across 
the projected 50-year period. Although we have expanded the area of known 
occurrence for this species, we point out that climate change threatens the 
stability of this newly-discovered population strongly, and that this danger is 
intensified by deforestation, fire and hunting. We recommend that further 
studies be carried out to confirm the presence of the species in adjacent areas, 
those indicated by generated models as being potential environmentally suitable. 
In addition, we recommend intensifying forest restoration in currently pastured 
areas, and protection of the areas forming the current and future habitat of 
this species through such measures as protected area creation.

Population-level consequences of inheritable somatic mutations and the evolution 
of mutation rates in plants.

Lesaffre T(1).

Inbreeding depression, that is the decrease in fitness of inbred relative to 
outbred individuals, was shown to increase strongly as life expectancy increases 
in plants. Because plants are thought to not have a separated germline, it was 
proposed that this pattern could be generated by somatic mutations accumulating 
during growth, since larger and more long-lived species have more opportunities 
for mutations to accumulate. A key determinant of the role of somatic mutations 
is the rate at which they occur, which probably differs between species because 
mutation rates may evolve differently in species with constrasting life 
histories. In this paper, I study the evolution of the mutation rates in plants, 
and consider the population-level consequences of inheritable somatic mutations 
given this evolution. I show that despite substantially lower somatic and 
meiotic mutation rates, more long-lived species still tend to accumulate larger 
amounts of deleterious mutations because of the increased number of 
opportunities they have to acquire mutations during growth, leading to higher 
levels of inbreeding depression in these species. However, the magnitude of this 
increase depends strongly on how mutagenic meiosis is relative to growth, to the 
point of being close to non-existent in some situations.

IMPORTANCE: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a critical health problem in 
regions of limited resources (RLRs). Younger populations are among the most 
impacted. The objective of this review is to analyze recent consensus-based 
algorithms, protocols and guidelines proposed for the care of patients with TBI 
in RLRs.
OBSERVATIONS: The principal mechanisms for sTBI in RLRs are road traffic 
injuries (RTIs) and violence. Limitations of care include suboptimal or 
non-existent pre-hospital care, overburdened emergency services, lack of trained 
human resources, and surgical and intensive care. Low-cost neuromonitoring 
systems are currently in testing, and formal neurotrauma registries are forming 
to evaluate both long-term outcomes and best practices at every level of care
