official recommendations are available for diagnosis and treatment of patients 
with testosterone deficiency. The inconsistencies in the guidelines merely 
create confusion among the physicians instead of providing clear information. 
Furthermore, there is no definite method to assess serum testosterone and 
clinical symptoms. In the era of active testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), 
physicians' practice patterns should be consistent with the clinical practice 
guidelines to avoid the misuse of testosterone. In this review, the author 
introduces the evolution of clinical guidelines to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the differences and controversies with respect to TRT.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects 40⁻70% of women, but infection has been reported 
in >95% of breast cancer patients. We investigated the consequences of these 
observations by infecting mice with mCMV or a negative control medium for 4 
days, 11 days or 10 weeks to establish active, intermediate or latent 
infections, respectively. Syngeneic 4T1 or E0771 breast cancer cells were then 
injected into a mammary fat pad of BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice, respectively. 
Infection did not affect tumor growth in these conditions, but latently infected 
BALB/c mice developed more lung metastases. The latent mCMV infection of 
MMTV-PyVT mice, which develop spontaneous breast tumors, also did not affect the 
number or sizes of breast tumors. However, there were more tumors that were 
multilobed with greater blood content, which had enhanced vasculature and 
decreased collagen content. Most significantly, mCMV infection also increased 
the number and size of lung metastases, which showed a higher cell 
proliferation. Viral DNA was detected in breast tumors and lung nodules although 
viral mRNA was not. These novel results have important clinical implications 
since an increased metastasis is prognostic of decreased survival. This work 
provides evidence that treating or preventing HCMV infections may increase the 
life expectancy of breast cancer patients by decreasing metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Worst-case, typical, and best-case scenarios for survival, based on 
simple multiples of an individual's expected survival time (EST), estimated by 
their oncologist, are a useful way of formulating and explaining prognosis. We 
aimed to determine the accuracy and prognostic significance of oncologists' 
estimates of EST, and the accuracy of the resulting scenarios for survival time, 
in advanced gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six oncologists estimated the EST at baseline for 
each of the 152 participants they enrolled in the INTEGRATE trial. We 
hypothesized that oncologists' estimates of EST would be unbiased (∼50% would be 
longer or shorter than the observed survival time [OST]); imprecise (<33% within 
0.67-1.33 times the OST); independently predictive of overall survival (OS); and 
accurate at deriving scenarios for survival time with approximately 10% of 
patients dying within a quarter of their EST (worst-case scenario), 50% living 
within half to double their EST (typical scenario), and 10% living three or more 
times their EST (best-case scenario).
RESULTS: Oncologists' estimates of EST were unbiased (45% were shorter than the 
OST, 55% were longer); imprecise (29% were within 0.67-1.33 times observed); 
moderately discriminative (Harrell's C-statistic 0.62, p = .001); and an 
independently significant predictor of OS (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.83-0.95; p = .001) in a Cox model including performance status, 
number of metastatic sites, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥3, treatment group, 
age, and health-related quality of life (EORTC-QLQC30 physical function score). 
Scenarios for survival time derived from oncologists' estimates were remarkably 
accurate: 9% of patients died within a quarter of their EST, 57% lived within 
half to double their EST, and 12% lived three times their EST or longer.
CONCLUSION: Oncologists' estimates of EST were unbiased, imprecise, moderately 
discriminative, and independently significant predictors of OS. Simple multiples 
of the EST accurately estimated worst-case, typical, and best-case scenarios for 
survival time in advanced gastric cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Results of this study demonstrate that oncologists' 
estimates of expected survival time for their patients with advanced gastric 
cancer were unbiased, imprecise, moderately discriminative, and independently 
significant predictors of overall survival. Simple multiples of the expected 
survival time accurately estimated worst-case, typical, and best-case scenarios 
for survival time in advanced gastric cancer.

摘要 背景。肿瘤学家根据个人预期生存时间 (EST) 
的简单倍数估计的最坏生存情况设想、一般生存情况设想和最佳生存情况设想是制定和解释预后的有效方法。我们的目的在于确定肿瘤学家估计的晚期胃癌EST的准确性和预后意义，以及由此产生的生存时间设想的准确性。 
材料和方法。六十六位肿瘤学家估计了 152 名参与 INTEGRATE 试验的参与者中每位参与者的基线EST。我们假设肿瘤学家估计的EST是中肯的 [~50% 
患者的预期生存时间将比观察生存时间 (OST)长或短]；不精确(<33%在OST的 0.67–1.33 倍之间)；可独立预测总生存期 
(OS)；并且准确得出生存时间的设想，其中，约 10% 的患者在其EST的四分之一内死亡(最坏情况设想)，50% 
患者的生存时间在EST的一半至两倍之间(一般情况设想)，10% 患者的生存时间为EST的三倍或以上(最佳情况设想)。 结果。肿瘤学家估计的EST是中肯的(45% 
的患者比OST短，55% 的患者比OST长)；不精确(29%在OST的 0.67–1.33 倍之间)；比较具有判别性(Harrell 的 C 统计量为 
0.62，p = 0.001)；并且是 Cox 模型中OS的独立重要的预测因子(风险比， 0.89；95% 置信区间，0.83–0.95；p 
= 0.001)，包括体能状况、转移灶数量、中性粒细胞与淋巴细胞比率 ≥3、治疗小组、年龄和健康相关的生活质量(EORTC‐QLQC30 
身体机能评分)。根据肿瘤学家的估计得出的生存时间设想非常准确:9% 的患者在EST的四分之一内死亡，57% 患者的生存时间在EST的一半至两倍之间，12% 
患者的生存时间为EST的三倍或以上。 
结论。肿瘤学家估计的ESY是中肯的、不精确、比较具有判别性，并且是OS独立重要的预测因子。简单的EST倍数准确估计了晚期胃癌生存时间的最坏情况、一般情况和最佳情况设想。 
实践意义:本研究的结果表明，肿瘤学家估计的晚期胃癌患者的预期生存时间是中肯的、不精确、比较具有判别性，并且是总生存期独立重要的预测因子。简单的预期生存时间倍数准确估计了晚期胃癌生存时间的最坏情况、一般情况和最佳情况设想。

Plain Language Summary: Inverted papilloma of the frontal sinus is a challenging 
disease. Given its rarity, only small case series are present in the literature. 
The objectives of the present study are to review our experience in the surgical 
management of inverted papillomas involving the frontal sinus and to propose a 
practical algorithm for selecting the most appropriate approach. Data on 
patients affected by inverted papilloma involving the frontal sinus and 
surgically treated between 2002 and 2016 were collected. The type of involvement 
of frontal sinus and extent of surgery performed (endoscopic endonasal, external 
or combined approaches) were analysed. A brief review of consistent literature 
was also carried out. Forty-seven consecutive patients were treated using an 
exclusive endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) in 18 cases, while a combined 
endonasal with external osteoplastic approach was required in 29 cases. Most 
patients (29/47, 62%) had been treated previously, mainly by an endoscopic 
approach. A single intraoperative complication occurred (1/47, 2%), i.e. 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, that was successfully repaired intraoperatively 
without any consequences. Recurrences were observed in only 2/47 cases (4%) 
after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range, 12-137). The management of inverted 
papilloma involving the frontal sinus requires great expertise and the surgical 
technique should be tailored to the site of attachment of the tumour, its 
extension and the anatomical conformation of each frontal sinus. The encouraging 
results obtained in this case series support the use of this practical treatment 
algorithm.

Publisher: Approccio chirurgico al papilloma invertito interessante il seno 
frontale: un algoritmo pratico per la pianificazione del trattamento.
RIASSUNTO: Il papilloma invertito del seno frontale è una patologia di non 
facile gestione. Data la sua rarità, in letteratura si possono ritrovare solo 
casistiche di dimensioni ridotte. Gli obiettivi del presente studio sono, da un 
lato, il presentare la nostra esperienza nella gestione chirurgica del papilloma 
invertito interessante il seno frontale e, dall’altro, il proporre un algoritmo 
pratico per la selezione del miglior approccio. Sono stati raccolti i dati dei 
pazienti affetti da papilloma invertito del seno frontale e trattati 
chirurgicamente dal 2002 al 2016. Sono stati analizzati il tipo di 
coinvolgimento del seno frontale e l’invasività della procedura chirurgica 
(endoscopica endonasale, esterna o combinata). È stata, inoltre, condotta una 
breve revisione della letteratura al riguardo. Complessivamente la casistica è 
risultata composta da 47 pazienti, di cui 18 trattati con approccio puramente 
endoscopico endonasale, mentre i restanti 29 con approccio combinato endoscopico 
con lembo osteoplastico frontale. La maggior parte dei pazienti era stata 
trattata precedentemente presso altri centri (29/47, 62%), prevalentemente 
tramite un approccio endoscopico endonasale. È stata riscontrata una singola 
complicanza intraoperatoria (1/47, 2%), rappresentata da una fistola 
rinoliquorale, immediatamente riparata e scevra di successive sequele. Sono 
state individuate due recidive di malattia (2/47, 4%) dopo un follow up medio di 
43 mesi (range 12-137). La gestione del papilloma invertito interessante il seno 
frontale richiede una valida esperienza e la tecnica chirurgica deve essere 
adeguata al sito d’attacco del tumore, alla sua estensione e alla conformazione 
dei seni frontali. I risultati incoraggianti ottenuti nella nostra casistica 
supportano l’utilizzo di questo algoritmo pratico di trattamento.

PURPOSE: Efficient management of COPD represents an international challenge. 
Effective management strategies within the means of limited health care budgets 
are urgently required. This analysis aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
a home-based disease management (DM) intervention vs usual management (UM) in 
patients from the COPD Patient Management European Trial (COMET).
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in 319 intention-to-treat patients 
over 12 months in COMET. The analysis captured unplanned all-cause 
hospitalization days, mortality, and quality-adjusted life expectancy. Costs 
were evaluated from a National Health Service perspective for France, Germany, 
and Spain, and in a pooled analysis, and were expressed in 2015 Euros (EUR). 
Quality of life was assessed using the 15D health-related quality-of-life 
instrument and mapped to utility scores.
RESULTS: Home-based DM was associated with improved mortality and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. DM and UM were associated with equivalent 
direct costs (DM reduced costs by EUR -37 per patient per year) in the pooled 
analysis. DM was associated with lower costs in France (EUR -806 per patient per 
year) and Spain (EUR -51 per patient per year), but higher costs in Germany (EUR 
391 per patient per year). Evaluation of cost per death avoided and cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained showed that DM was dominant (more QALYs 
and cost saving) in France and Spain, and cost-effective in Germany vs UM. 
Nonparametric bootstrapping analysis, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
EUR 20,000 per QALY gained, indicated that the probability of home-based DM 
being cost-effective vs UM was 87.7% in France, 81.5% in Spain, and 75.9% in 
Germany.
CONCLUSION: Home-based DM improved clinical outcomes at equivalent cost vs UM in 
France and Spain, and in the pooled analysis. DM was cost-effective in Germany 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 2,541 per QALY gained. The 
COMET home-based DM intervention could represent an attractive alternative to UM 
for European health care payers.

Craniofacial epidermoid cysts are rare tumors representing 0.2%-1% of all the 
intracranial tumors. Intradiploic variants account for 25% of these cysts. These 
cysts are benign, slow-growing, congenital tumors derived from ectodermal 
remnants misplaced during embryogenesis. Mean age at presentation of these 
lesions is 40 years; epidermoid cysts are typically asymptomatic (Toglia JU, 
Netsky MG, Alexander E Jr. Epithelial (epidermoid) tumors of the cranium. Their 
common nature and pathogenesis. J Neurosurg 1965;23:384-93). Giant extradural 
epidermoid cysts with profound deformation of the brain and extensive lytic 
skull lesions may allow a normal life without any significant neurological 
deficits. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging play an 
important role in the diagnosis of the lesion and management protocol. 
Histologically, epidermoid cysts are lined by stratified squamous epithelium and 
are filled with anucleatic keratin (Hao S, Tang J, Wu Z, Zhang L, Zhang J, Wang 
Z. Natural malignant transformation of an intracranial epidermoid cyst. J Formos 
Med Assoc 2010;109:390-6). Complete removal of the cyst along with its capsule 
is the treatment of choice. Recurrences of intradiploic epidermoid cyst have 
been reported. Here, we report a case of 14-year-old girl presenting with a 
giant frontal intradiploic epidermoid cyst with an intracranial and extracranial 
extension without any neurological deficits. Bifrontal craniotomy was performed 
and cyst was excised in toto.

Efficient and precise genome editing is essential for clinical applications and 
generating animal models, which requires engineered nucleases with high editing 
ability while low off-target activity. Here we present a high-throughput 
sequencing method, primer-extension-mediated sequencing (PEM-seq), to 
comprehensively assess both editing ability and specificity of engineered 
nucleases. We showed CRISPR/Cas9-generated breaks could lead to chromosomal 
translocations and large deletions by PEM-seq. We also found that Cas9 nickase 
possessed lower off-target activity while with some loss of target cleavage 
ability. However, high-fidelity Cas9 variants, including both eCas9 and the new 
FeCas9, could significantly reduce the Cas9 off-target activity with no obvious 
editing retardation. Moreover, we found AcrIIA4 inhibitor could greatly reduce 
the activities of Cas9, but off-target loci were not so effectively suppressed 
as the on-target sites. Therefore, PEM-seq fully evaluating engineered nucleases 
could help choose better genome editing strategy at given loci than other 
methods detecting only off-target activity.

PURPOSE: Age is an important prognostic factor for functional and oncological 
outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP). Considering the long life-expectancy 
of young patients (≤ 45 years), it remains important to examine their outcomes.
METHODS: Of 16.049 patients who underwent RP between 01/2006 and 12/2014 at the 
Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, 119 (0.7%) were ≤ 45. Known 
prognosticators were compared according to patient age at RP (categorical 
as ≤ 45, > 45 and ≤ 65, > 65 years). Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox-regressions 
analyzed oncological outcomes [biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and 
metastasis-free survival (MFS)]. Logistic regressions were used for functional 
outcome. Urinary continence (UC) was defined as the use of 0 or 1 safety pad/day 
and potency as an IIEF-5 score of ≥ 18.
RESULTS: Compared to their older counterparts, patients ≤ 45 years had more 
favorable tumor characteristics. Of all patients aged ≤ 45 years, 89% underwent 
bilateral and 9.3% unilateral nerve-sparing procedure. Five year BCR-free 
survival and MFS were 80.2% and 98.7% for patients ≤ 45 years, 72.8% and 95.0% 
for patients > 45 and ≤ 65 years and 70.5% and 94.9% for patients > 65 years. 
For the same groups, 1-year UC-rates were 97.4%, 89.4%, and 84.7% while 1.3%, 
8.2%, and 11.6% used 1-2 pads/24 h. At 1-year, 75.6%, 58.6%, and 45.3% of 
preoperatively potent patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing were 
considered potent. Younger age was an independent predictor of favorable 
functional outcome also in multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged ≤ 45 years had more favorable tumor characteristics 
and oncological outcomes. Moreover, younger patients should be counseled about 
the excellent postoperative continence and potency rates.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain 
tumor, with an average life expectancy of 12-15 months. GBM is highly 
infiltrated by microglial cells (MG) promoting tumor growth and invasiveness. 
Moreover, microglia activation and subsequent neuroinflammation seem to be 
involved in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction commonly observed in several 
central nervous system diseases, including brain tumors. Nevertheless, how the 
crosstalk between microglia and tumor cells interferes with BBB function is far 
from being clarified. Herein, we evaluated the effects of reciprocal 
interactions between MG and GBM cells in the barrier properties of brain 
endothelial cells (ECs), using an in vitro approach. The exposure of ECs to the 
inflammatory microenvironment mediated by MG-GBM crosstalk induced a decrease in 
the transendothelial electric resistance and an increase in permeability across 
the ECs (macromolecular flux of 4 kDa-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 
70 kDa-Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran). These effects were accompanied by a 
downregulation of the intercellular junction proteins, β-catenin and zonula 
occludens. Moreover, the dynamic interaction between microglia and tumor cells 
triggered the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by microglia and subsequent 
activation of the downstream Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Interestingly, the depletion of IL-6 or the 
blockade of the JAK/STAT3 signaling with AG490 were able to prevent the EC 
hyperpermeability. Overall, we demonstrated that IL-6 released during MG-GBM 
crosstalk leads to barrier dysfunction through the activation of the JAK/STAT3 
pathway in ECs and downregulation of intercellular junction proteins. These 
results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the disruption of 
BBB permeability in GBM.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), using the resourceful Mn-based materials as 
cathodes, have been considered as promising candidates for large-scale 
energy-storage applications. However, the representative P2-type Mn-based 
layered oxide cathode usually suffers from a limited specific capacity and a 
poor cycle life in Na-ion intercalation and deintercalation processes because of 
the unavoidable phase transition at a high voltage. Herein, we developed 
Ru-substituted P2-Na0.6MnO2 as a promising sodium host with a high reversible 
capacity and cycle life. The multiple characterization investigations reveal 
that Ru substitution could improve the electronic and ionic conductions and 
particularly suppress the phase transition of P2-OP4, resulting in the extension 
of the single-phase reaction region. Ru substitution not only enhances the 
specific capacity (209.3 mA h g-1) but also improves the rate capability (∼100 
mA h g-1 at 50 C) and cycling stability. This work may open a new avenue for 
designing and fabricating SIBs by using Mn-based cathodes with high capacity and 
stability.

BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators has 
been associated with reduced rates of all-cause rehospitalizations and mortality 
among device recipients, but long-term economic benefits have not been studied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An economic model was developed using the PREDICT RM 
database comparing outcomes with and without remote monitoring. The database 
included patients ages 65 to 89 who received a Boston Scientific device from 
2006 to 2010. Parametric survival equations were derived for rehospitalization 
and mortality to predict outcomes over a maximum time horizon of 25 years. The 
analysis assessed rehospitalization, mortality, and the cost-effectiveness 
(expressed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year) of remote 
monitoring versus no remote monitoring. Remote monitoring was associated with 
reduced mortality; average life expectancy and average quality-adjusted life 
years increased by 0.77 years and 0.64, respectively (6.85 life years and 5.65 
quality-adjusted life years). When expressed per patient-year, remote monitoring 
patients had fewer subsequent rehospitalizations (by 0.08 per patient-year) and 
lower hospitalization costs (by $554 per patient year). With longer life 
expectancies, remote monitoring patients experienced an average of 0.64 
additional subsequent rehospitalizations with increased average lifetime 
hospitalization costs of $2784. Total costs of outpatient and physician claims 
were higher with remote monitoring ($47 515 vs $42 792), but average per 
patient-year costs were lower ($6232 vs $6244). The base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $10 752 per quality-adjusted life year, making 
remote monitoring high-value care.
CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring is a cost-effective approach for the lifetime 
management of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.

Chicken frankfurter emulsions were challenged with ca. 1000 C. bolulinum 
spores/g and incubated at 27°C. Botulinal toxin formation was delayed by the 
addition of nisin or nitrite, either singly or in combination. In the absence of 
nisin or nitrite, samples became toxic within 1 wk. A 4-wk extension of 
shelf-life was achieved by addition of 156 ppm nitrite. The addition of 500 ppm 
nisin allowed only a 1-wk extension of shelf-life. The addition of 100 or 250 
ppm nisin together with 120 ppm nitrite was superior to addition of 156 ppm 
nitrite, whereas the addition of 100 or 250 ppm nisin together with 80 ppm 
nitrite was somewhat less effective than 156 ppm nitrite. In TPYG broth, an 
adjuvant effect was observed between nisin and nitrite. Levels of nisin and 
nitrite that were not effective in TPYG broth when used alone did prevent spore 
outgrowth when used in combination.

Age-standardised rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are substantially higher 
in men than women. This explains why CVD has traditionally been seen as a "man's 
problem". However, CVD is the leading cause of death in women, worldwide, and is 
one of the most common causes of disability-adjusted life-years lost. In 
general, this is under-recognised and, in several ways, women are disadvantaged 
in terms of CVD. Both in primary and secondary prevention, there is evidence 
that women are undertreated, compared to men. Women often experience heart 
disease in a different way compared to men, and lack of recognition of this has 
been shown to have adverse consequences. Female patients of male cardiac 
physicians have been found to have worse outcomes than their male counterparts, 
with no such gender differential for female cardiologists. Clinical trials in 
CVD primarily recruit male patients, yet, it is well recognised that some drugs 
act differently in women and men. Diabetes and smoking, and perhaps other risk 
factors, confer a greater proportional excess cardiovascular risk to women than 
to men, whilst adverse pregnancies and factors concerned with the female 
reproductive cycle give women added vulnerability to CVD. However, women's 
health research is skewed towards mother and child health, an area where, 
arguably, the greatest public health gains have already been made, and breast 
cancer. Hence there is a need to redefine what is meant by "women's health" to 
encompass the whole lifecycle, with a stronger emphasis on CVD and other 
non-communicable diseases. Sex-specific analyses of research data should be the 
norm, whenever feasible.

Aims: To conduct a lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of rasburicase 
compared with standard of care (SOC) for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in children 
with hematologic malignancies from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. 
Materials and methods: The CEA was performed using a decision tree model with a 
lifetime horizon. The model explores the cost-effectiveness of rasburicase vs 
SOC for both preventing TLS and treating established TLS among pediatric 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both the prophylaxis-use model and treatment-use 
model incorporate long-term health states of the diseases: survival without TLS 
and death. The efficacy data of rasburicase and SOC were obtained from published 
literature. Drug costs, healthcare resource utilization (HRU), and adverse event 
(AE) management costs were obtained via a published study with clinical experts. 
Costs in US dollar and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are reported, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated. 
Uncertainties due to parameter fluctuations in the model were assessed through 
one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). 
Results: During TLS prevention, compared with SOC, the ICER of rasburicase 
treatment in China are $17,580.04/QALY, $5,783.45/QALY, and $5,391.00/QALY for 
pediatric patients with AML, ALL, and NHL, respectively. For the established TLS 
treatment, compared with SOC, the ICERs of rasburicase treatment are 
$2,031.18/QALY, $1,142.93/QALY, and $990.37/QALY for pediatric patients with 
AML, ALL, and NHL, respectively. Limitations: The clinical data for SOC are 
based on the published study in China, and the rasburicase prevention or 
treatment failure rate was either calculated based on the risk ratio or directly 
from the clinical study among non-Chinese pediatric patients. Another study 
limitation was the lack of utility data for pediatric patients with TLS and 
without TLS. Thus, the utility scores of pediatric cancer survivors were used as 
an alternative. Conclusion: Rasburicase is estimated to be a cost-effective 
alternative to SOC in the prevention and treatment of TLS among Chinese 
pediatric patients with AML, ALL, and NHL.

Tooth Loss in Modern Dentistry Abstract. The Swiss population follows the trend 
of other industrialized countries and shows an increased life expectancy 
compared to previous generations. Old age is reached increasingly with one's own 
teeth. Older restorations of teeth must be replaced and produced anew. Previous 
reconstructions often have the disadvantage that they are invasive and 
reinterventions or new fabrications are only possible to a limited extent. 
Advances in material technology allow new minimally invasive therapies. Adhesive 
bridges have become possible due to material developments in material science 
and allow aesthetic, non-invasive, long-term stable solutions. The specialist 
dentist SSO for Reconstructive Dentistry is the expert for the rehabilitation of 
teeth after tooth loss. He takes care of the careful restoration of the teeth 
according to functional and aesthetic criteria and draws on a sound knowledge of 
therapy options, techniques and materials acquired in many years of additional 
training.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die Schweizer Bevölkerung folgt dem Trend der 
industrialisierten Länder und weist eine erhöhte Lebenserwartung im Vergleich zu 
früheren Generationen auf. Das höhere Alter wird vermehrt mit Eigenbezahnung 
erreicht. Diese muss unter Umständen mehrfach im Laufe des Lebens saniert 
werden. Bestehende Restaurationen der Zähne müssen ausgewechselt und neu 
angefertigt werden können. Bisherige Rekonstruktionen haben oft den Nachteil, 
dass sie invasiv sind und Reinterventionen oder Neuanfertigungen nur bedingt 
möglich sind. Errungenschaften in der Materialtechnik erlauben neue 
minimalinvasive Therapien. Klebebrücken sind aufgrund der materialtechnischen 
Entwicklungen möglich geworden und erlauben ästhetische, nicht invasive, 
langzeitstabile Lösungen. Der Fachzahnarzt SSO für Rekonstruktive Zahnmedizin 
ist innerhalb der Zahnmedizin der Spezialist für die Rehabilitation der Zähne 
nach Zahnverlust. Er kümmert sich um die sorgfältige Wiederherstellung der Zähne 
nach funktionellen und ästhetischen Kriterien und greift dabei auf ein in einer 
langjährigen Zusatzausbildung erworbenes fundiertes Wissen über 
Therapiemöglichkeiten, Techniken sowie Materialien zurück.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a rising global threat to health and a major contributor 
to health inequalities. Weight management programmes that are effective, 
economical and reach underprivileged groups are needed. We examined whether a 
multi-modal group intervention structured to cater for clients from 
disadvantaged communities (Weight Action Programme; WAP) has better one-year 
outcomes than a primary care standard weight management intervention delivered 
by practice nurses (PNI).
METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, 330 obese adults were recruited 
from general practices in London and allocated (2:1) to WAP (N = 221) delivered 
over eight weekly group sessions or PNI (N = 109) who received four sessions 
over eight weeks. Both interventions covered diet, physical activity and 
self-monitoring. The primary outcome was the change in weight from baseline at 
12 months. To indicate value to the NHS, a cost effectiveness analysis estimated 
group differences in cost and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) related to 
WAP.
RESULTS: Participants were recruited from September 2012 to January 2014 with 
follow-up completed in February 2015. Most participants were not in paid 
employment and 60% were from ethnic minorities. 88% of participants in each 
study arm provided at least one recorded outcome and were included in the 
primary analysis. Compared with the PNI, WAP was associated with greater weight 
loss overall (- 4·2 kg vs. - 2·3 kg; difference = - 1·9 kg, 95% CI: -3·7 to 
- 0·1; P = 0·04) and was more likely to generate a weight loss of at least 5% at 
12 months (41% vs. 27%, OR = 14·61 95% CI: 2·32 to 91·96, P = 0·004). With an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £7742/QALY, WAP would be 
considered highly cost effective compared to PNI.
CONCLUSIONS: The task-based programme evaluated in this study can provide a 
template for an effective and economical approach to weight management that can 
reach clients from disadvantaged communities.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complication following surgery. 
Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are 
efficacious but come with inherent bleeding risk. Mechanical prophylaxis, such 
as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), does not induce bleeding but may be 
difficult to implement beyond the immediate post-operative period. This study 
compared the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved of commonly used 
VTE prophylaxis regimens after lower limb arthroplasty.
METHODS: A previously published cost-utility model considering major efficacy 
and safety endpoints was updated to estimate the 1-year cost-effectiveness of 
different VTE prophylaxis regimens. The VTE strategies assessed included 
apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, LMWH, IPC, IPC + LMWH and IPC + apixaban. 
Efficacy data were derived from studies in PubMed, and cost data came from the 
2017 Australian AR-DRG and PBS pricing schemes.
RESULTS: Costs for VTE prophylaxis including treatment of its associated 
complications over the first year after surgery ranged from AUD $644 (IPC) to 
AUD $956 (rivaroxaban). Across 500 simulations, IPC was the cheapest measure in 
73% of simulations. In 97% of simulations, a DOAC was associated with the 
highest resulting QALYs. Compared to IPC, apixaban was cost-effective in 76.4% 
of simulations and apixaban + IPC in 87.8% of simulations. For VTE events 
avoided, the DOACs and IPC were on par. LMWH and LMWH + IPC were negatively 
dominated.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, IPC or a sequential/simultaneous combination of both is 
currently the most cost-effective VTE prophylaxis regimens. The choice between 
them is best guided by the relative VTE and bleeding risks of individual 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Dravet Syndrome is a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 
characterised by epileptic seizures, cognitive impairment and motor disorders. 
Gait is markedly impaired and could benefit from targeted intervention to 
improve quality of life for patient and caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the state of the art regarding gait deviations in 
patients with Dravet Syndrome.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Web of Science, Science 
Direct and Embase. Studies that assessed gait deviations in patients diagnosed 
with Dravet Syndrome using clinical observation, video gait analysis or three 
dimensional (3D) gait analysis and reported gait characteristics, spatiotemporal 
or kinematic outcomes were included. Screening, quality assessment and data 
extraction were performed by independent reviewers.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 478 citations, nine articles were included. The total 
study population had an age range from 2.5 to 47 years. Three studies used 
clinical observation, three studies video analysis and three studies 3D gait 
analysis. Crouch gait was observed in about half of the population next to a 
variety of other gait deviations such as parkinsonian and cerebellar gait. Other 
findings included abnormalities in spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics, 
passive knee extension deficits, skeletal malalignment and neurological signs.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of gait characteristics was observed with crouch gait 
being the most reported gait pattern. Inconsistency in methods and findings from 
clinical and instrumented evaluation impede thorough understanding of the causal 
mechanism and evolution behind these deviations.
