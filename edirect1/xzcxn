BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy and reducing birth rates indicate that 
the world population is becoming older, with many challenges related to quality 
of life for old and fragile people, as well as their informal caregivers. In the 
last few years, novel information and communication technology techniques 
generally known as the Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed, and they 
are centered around the provision of computation and communication capabilities 
to objects. The IoT may provide older people with devices that enable their 
functional independence in daily life by either extending their own capacity or 
facilitating the efforts of their caregivers. LoRa is a proprietary wireless 
transmission protocol optimized for long-range, low-power, low-data-rate 
applications. LoRaWAN is an open stack built upon LoRa.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes an infrastructure designed and experimentally 
developed to support IoT deployment in a health care setup, and the management 
of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia has been chosen for a 
proof-of-concept study. The peculiarity of the proposed approach is that it is 
based on the LoRaWAN protocol stack, which exploits unlicensed frequencies and 
allows for the use of very low-power radio devices, making it a rational choice 
for IoT communication.
METHODS: A complete LoRaWAN-based infrastructure was designed, with features 
partly decided in agreement with caregivers, including outdoor patient tracking 
to control wandering; fall recognition; and capability of collecting data for 
further clinical studies. Further features suggested by caregivers were night 
motion surveillance and indoor tracking for large residential structures. 
Implementation involved a prototype node with tracking and fall recognition 
capabilities, a middle layer based on an existing network server, and a Web 
application for overall management of patients and caregivers. Tests were 
performed to investigate indoor and outdoor capabilities in a real-world setting 
and study the applicability of LoRaWAN in health and social care scenarios.
RESULTS: Three experiments were carried out. One aimed to test the technical 
functionality of the infrastructure, another assessed indoor features, and the 
last assessed outdoor features. The only critical issue was fall recognition, 
because a slip was not always easy to recognize.
CONCLUSIONS: The project allowed the identification of some advantages and 
restrictions of the LoRaWAN technology when applied to the health and social 
care sectors. Free installation allows the development of services that reach 
ranges comparable to those available with cellular telephony, but without 
running costs like telephony fees. However, there are technological limitations, 
which restrict the scenarios in which LoRaWAN is applicable, although there is 
room for many applications. We believe that setting up low-weight infrastructure 
and carefully determining whether applications can be concretely implemented 
within LoRaWAN limits might help in optimizing community care activities while 
not adding much burden and cost in information technology management.

Most people living with HIV (PLHIV) with reliable access to antiretroviral 
treatment (ART) have a life expectancy similar to uninfected populations. 
Despite this, HIV can negatively affect their social and psychological 
wellbeing. This study aimed to enhance understanding of the expectations PLHIV 
hold for HIV cure research and the implications this has for HIV cure research 
trials. We interviewed 20 Australian PLHIV about their expectations for HIV cure 
research outcomes and the impact a potential cure for HIV may have on their 
everyday lives. Data were analysed thematically, using both inductive and 
deductive approaches. The significance of a cure for HIV was expressed by 
participants as something that would offer relief from their sense of vigilance 
or uncertainty about their health into the future. A cure was also defined in 
social terms, as alleviation from worry about potential for onward HIV 
transmission, concerns for friends and family, and the negative impact of 
HIV-related stigma. Participants did not consider sustained medication-free 
viral suppression (or remission) as a cure for HIV because this did not offer 
certainty in remaining virus free in a way that would alleviate these fears and 
concerns. A cure was seen as complete elimination of HIV from the body. There is 
an ethical need to consider the expectations of PLHIV in design of, and 
recruitment for, HIV cure-related research. The language used to describe HIV 
cure research should differentiate the long-term aspiration of achieving 
complete elimination of HIV from the body and possible shorter-term therapeutic 
advances, such as achieving medication free viral suppression.

PURPOSE: To study the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab and bevacizumab for the 
treatment of age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: We used a decision tree model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 
ranibizumab and bevacizumab for the treatment of age-related macular 
degeneration, from the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) perspective. 
Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were administered to patients with the same 
treatment procedure, and the difference in treatment costs was calculated based 
on the cost of the drugs. Direct costs were estimated using the information 
provided by the Brazilian SUS. Effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) was calculated based on the utility values for visual impairment. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by comparing both 
treatments. The analytical horizon was one year.
RESULTS: The decision tree analysis showed that the difference in treatment 
effectiveness was 0.01 QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that 
ranibizumab treatment required an incremental annual cost of more than R$ 2 
million to generate 1 additional QALY, as compared to bevacizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: From the Brazilian SUS perspective, bevacizumab is more 
cost-effective than ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration. Its use could allow potential annual savings in health 
budget.

Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are small intracellular proteins that 
reversibly bind fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. In cestodes, due to 
their inability to synthesise fatty acids de novo, FABPs have been proposed as 
essential proteins, and thus, as possible drug targets and/or carriers against 
these parasites. We performed data mining in Echinococcus multilocularis and 
Echinococcus granulosus genomes in order to test whether this family of proteins 
is more complex than previously reported. By exploring the genomes of E. 
multilocularis and E. granulosus, six genes coding for FABPs were found in each 
organism. In the case of E. granulosus, all of them have different coding 
sequences, whereas in E. multilocularis, two of the genes code for the same 
protein. Remarkably, one of the genes (in both cestodes) encodes a FABP with a 
C-terminal extension unusual for this family of proteins. The newly described 
genes present variations in their structure in comparison with previously 
described FABP genes in Echinococcus spp. The coding sequences for E. 
multilocularis were validated by cloning and sequencing. Moreover, differential 
expression patterns of FABPs were observed at different stages of the life cycle 
of E. multilocularis by exploring transcriptomic data from several sources. In 
summary, FABP family in cestodes is far more complex than previously thought and 
includes new members that seem to be only present in flatworms.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly symptomatic disease, with a 
wide range of disabilities affecting many bodily functions, even in younger 
persons with a short disease history. The availability of a cannabinoid 
oromucosal spray (Sativex) for the management of treatment-resistant MS 
spasticity has provided a new opportunity for many patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of Sativex in 
Italian patients with treatment-resistant MS spasticity. The analysis was based 
on the real-world data of a large registry of Italian patients.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using data collected 
prospectively from an electronic registry of all patients who began to use 
Sativex for MS-resistant spasticity between January 2014 and February 2015 in 30 
specialized MS units across Italy and were followed up for ≤ 6 months. Data on 
drug consumption and spasticity/utility were used to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Sativex, as compared with no intervention. No 
costs or spasticity/utility changes were assumed for no treatment intervention. 
The ICER was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, using the 
Italian NHS perspective and a 6-month time horizon.
RESULTS: Sativex effectiveness and consumption was estimated analyzing data of 
1350 patients from the registry. These patients reported a mean (SD) utility 
increment of 0.087 (0.069) after 1 month of treatment, 0.118 (0.073) after 
3 months' treatment and 0.127 (0.080) after 6 months' treatment. The 6-month 
cost of treating the entire population with Sativex was €1,361,266, with a €1008 
cost and 0.0284 QALYs gained per patient. The estimated ICER was €35,516 per 
QALY gained, with little variability around the central estimate of 
cost-effectiveness, as shown by the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.
CONCLUSION: The use of Sativex could improve the quality of life of patients 
with a reasonable incremental cost resulting as a cost-effective option for 
patients with MS-resistant spasticity. These results could help clinicians and 
decision makers to develop improved management strategies for spasticity in 
patients with MS, optimizing the use of available resources.

BACKGROUND: As the average life expectancy increases, anesthesiologists confront 
unique challenges in the perioperative care of elderly patients who have 
significant comorbidities. In this study, we evaluated Elixhauser comorbidity 
measures-based risk factors associated with 30day mortality in patients aged 66 
years and older who underwent femur fracture surgery.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III which 
contains the medical records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the United States between 2001 
and 2012 to identify patients admitted to the ICU after femur fracture surgery 
(n=209). Patients who died within 30 days of admission (case group, n=49) were 
propensity score-matched to patients who did not (control group, n=98). The 
variables for matching were age, sex, race, anemia (hemoglobin ≤10 g/dl), and 
malignancy. We attempted to explain mortality via nine independent factors: 
hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes, complicated diabetes, congestive heart 
failure (CHF), cardiac arrhythmias, chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, 
neurological disorders other than paralysis, and peripheral vascular disease.
RESULTS: Logistic regression identified three significant risk factors: CHF, 
arrhythmias, and neurological disorders other than paralysis. The odds ratio 
(OR) for the 30-day mortality of CHF was 4.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
2.18 to 12.06). The equivalent ORs for cardiac arrhythmias and neurological 
disorders other than paralysis were 2.61 (95% CI, 1.14 to 6.21) and 2.40 (95% 
CI, 0.95 to 6.48), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying patients with these risk factors (CHF, arrhythmias, and 
neurological disorders other than paralysis) will assist clinicians with 
perioperative planning and provide caregivers with valuable information for 
decision-making.

Patients with cystic fibrosis have increased risk for gastrointestinal cancer, 
lymphoid leukemia and testicular carcinomas. Chronic inflammation does not seem 
to be the only contributing factor. Mutations and epigenetic alterations in the 
CFTR gene may alter susceptibility to develop cancer. Lung cancer is up to now 
not frequently observed in CF patients. In lung cancer patients without CF low 
CFTR expression is significantly associated with advanced staging, lymph node 
metastasis. As the management and life expectancy of patients with cystic 
fibrosis have improved substantially in recent years, we expect an increased 
number of these patients diagnosed with lung cancer. In addition, it is possible 
that they, as a result of CFTR-dysfunction, will present with more aggressive 
lung tumors. Treating cancer in CF patients is a challenge because of 
multi-organ involvement and chronic colonization by resistant pathogens. The 
effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in this population needs to be further 
evaluated.

Dealing with spatial misalignment to model the relationship between deprivation 
and life expectancy: a model-based geostatistical approach.

BACKGROUND : Life expectancy at birth (LEB), one of the main indicators of human 
longevity, has often been used to characterise the health status of a 
population. Understanding its relationships with the deprivation is key to 
develop policies and evaluate interventions that are aimed at reducing health 
inequalities. However, methodological challenges in the analysis of LEB data 
arise from the fact that different Government agencies often provide spatially 
aggregated information on LEB and the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) at 
different spatial scales. Our objective is to develop a geostatistical framework 
that, unlike existing methods of inference, allows to carry out spatially 
continuous prediction while dealing with spatial misalignment of the areal-level 
data. METHODS : We developed a model-based geostatistical approach for the joint 
analysis of LEB and IMD, when these are available over different partitions of 
the study region. We model the spatial correlation in LEB and IMD across the 
areal units using inter-point distances based on a regular grid covering the 
whole of the study area. The advantages and strengths of the new methodology are 
illustrated through an analysis of LEB and IMD data from the Liverpool district 
council. RESULTS : We found that the effect of IMD on LEB is stronger in males 
than in females, explaining about 63.35% of the spatial variation in LEB in the 
former group and 38.92% in the latter. We also estimate that LEB is about 8.5 
years lower between the most and least deprived area of Liverpool for men, and 
7.1 years for women. Finally, we find that LEB, both in males and females, is at 
least 80% likely to be above the England wide average only in some areas falling 
in the electoral wards of Childwall, Woolton and Church. CONCLUSION : The novel 
model-based geostatistical framework provides a feasible solution to the spatial 
misalignment problem. More importantly, the proposed methodology has the 
following advantages over existing methods used model LEB: (1) it can deliver 
spatially continuous inferences using spatially aggregated data; (2) it can be 
applied to any form of misalignment with information provided at a range of 
spatial scales, from areal-level to pixel-level.

OBJECTIVES: Increasing physical activity reduces the risk of chronic illness 
including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. 
Lifestyle interventions can increase physical activity but few successfully 
engage men. This study aims to investigate the 5 year cost-effectiveness of 
EuroFIT, a program to improve physical activity tailored specifically for male 
football (soccer) fans compared to a no intervention comparison group.
METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model in which the impact of improving 
physical activity on five chronic health conditions (colorectal cancer, Type 2 
diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and depression) and mortality was 
modelled. We estimated costs from a societal perspective and expressed benefits 
as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). We obtained data from a 4-country 
(England, Netherlands, Portugal and Norway) pragmatic randomised controlled 
trial evaluating EuroFIT, epidemiological and cohort studies, and meta-analyses. 
We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the 
impact of uncertainty in the model's parameter values on the cost-effectiveness 
results. We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uncertainty and presented 
this using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). We tested the 
robustness of the base case analysis using five scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Average costs over 5 years per person receiving EuroFIT were €14,663 
and per person receiving no intervention €14,598. Mean QALYs over 5 years were 
4.05 per person for EuroFIT and 4.04 for no intervention. Thus, the average 
incremental cost per person receiving EuroFIT was €65 compared to no 
intervention, while the average QALY gain was 0.01. This resulted in an ICER of 
€5206 per QALY gained. CEACs show that the probability of EuroFIT being 
cost-effective compared to no intervention is 0.53, 0.56 and 0.58 at thresholds 
of €10,000, €22,000 and €34,000 per QALY gained, respectively. When using a time 
horizon of 10 years, the results suggest that EuroFIT is more effective and less 
expensive compared to (i.e. dominant over) no intervention with a probability of 
cost-effectiveness of 0.63 at a threshold of €22,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude the EuroFIT intervention is not cost-effective compared 
to no intervention over a period of 5 years from a societal perspective, but is 
more effective and less expensive (i.e. dominant) after 10 years. We thus 
suggest that EuroFIT can potentially improve public health in a cost-effective 
manner in the long term.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, the neutralizing abilities of the equine and the 
recently introduced camelid antivenoms on the hemodynamic parameters 
(inotropism, chronotropism, and arrhythmogenicity) were assessed following 
envenomation by Hemiscorpius lepturus venom in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At first, the electrophoretic profiles of both products 
were obtained by using the SDS-PAGE method (12.5%) and stained with Coomassie 
blue and silver nitrate. Secondly, different doses of the camelid antivenom (10, 
50, and 100 µl) were given intravenously in 10 min before venom injection (400 
µg/rat). The neutralizing potencies of camelid and equine antivenoms were 
measured by preincubation (100 µl) with H. lepturus venom for 30 min at room 
temperature. Finally, equal amounts of the antivenoms were injected 
intravenously to observe the hemodynamic changes.
RESULTS: Based on the electrophoretic profile, it was evident that undesired 
proteins significantly decreased in equine antivenom, owing to impurities. 
Pretreatment with the camelid antivenom (100 µl), neutralized the elevation of 
the mean arterial pressure evoked with scorpion venom injection (88.15±4.56 
versus 10.2±1.23 percent at the 8th min). The Incubation of the venom and the 
camelid antivenom counteracted the hemodynamic changes, but the equine product 
had no effect. The intravascular injection of the equine antivenom transiently 
increased the mean arterial pressure as compared to the control (108.67±8.63 
mmHg versus 52.67±1.93 mmHg at the 10th min).
CONCLUSION: The most obvious finding emerging from this study was that the 
camelid antivenom neutralized the hemodynamic changes in rats significantly, but 
in comparison, the equine antivenom had just a minor ability.

New and emerging pharmacotherapy for duchenne muscular dystrophy: a focus on 
synthetic therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the result of 
X-chromosome-linked mutations to the dystrophin protein gene that prevent the 
normal development and repair of muscles leading to muscle deterioration. The 
condition affects nearly 1 in 3,500 males worldwide. Current therapeutics have 
not been sufficient in providing a cure or resulting in a significant extension 
in life expectancy, but many therapeutic options are currently under 
investigation.
AREAS COVERED: This article provides an overview of the current and emerging 
therapies for DMD giving particular focus to synthetic therapeutic options. The 
authors further provide their expert opinion.
EXPERT OPINION: Many discrepancies in primary outcomes of trials have led to 
questions of efficacy for medications, as well as difficulty in securing FDA 
approval. A standardization of primary outcome strategies, as well as better 
access to investigational medications, may alleviate some of the controversy and 
pressures that exist on medication approvals. Many trials have identified 
cohorts who responded more favorably to medications, despite a lack of 
significance in the overall intent-to-treat populations. This indicates that 
more medication screening and personalized treatment with patient-specific 
targeting might deliver more clinically significant results.

Subcategorizing the Expected Value of Perfect Implementation to Identify When 
and Where to Invest in Implementation Initiatives.

Purpose. Clinical practice variations and low implementation of effective and 
cost-effective health care technologies are a key challenge for health care 
systems and may lead to suboptimal treatment and health loss for patients. The 
purpose of this work was to subcategorize the expected value of perfect 
implementation (EVPIM) to enable estimation of the absolute and relative value 
of eliminating slow, low, and delayed implementation. Methods. Building on the 
EVPIM framework, this work defines EVPIM subcategories to estimate the expected 
value of eliminating slow, low, or delayed implementation. The work also shows 
how information on regional implementation patterns can be used to estimate the 
value of eliminating regional implementation variation. The application of this 
subcategorization is illustrated by a case study of the implementation of an 
antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention after myocardial infarction in 
Sweden. Incremental net benefit (INB) estimates are based on published 
cost-effectiveness assessments and a threshold of SEK 250,000 (£22,300) per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results. In the case study, slow, low, and 
delayed implementation was estimated to represent 22%, 34%, and 44% of the total 
population EVPIM (2941 QALYs or SEK 735 million), respectively. The value of 
eliminating implementation variation across health care regions was estimated to 
39% of total EVPIM (1138 QALYs). Conclusion. Subcategorizing EVPIM estimates the 
absolute and relative value of eliminating different parts of suboptimal 
implementation. By doing so, this approach could help decision makers to 
identify which parts of suboptimal implementation are contributing most to total 
EVPIM and provide the basis for assessing the cost and benefit of implementation 
activities that may address these in future implementation of health care 
interventions.

The dense formation of abnormal scar tissue after total knee arthroplasty 
results in arthrofibrosis, an unfortunate sequela of inflammation. The purpose 
of this study was to use a validated rabbit model to assess the effects on 
surgically-induced knee joint contractures of two combined pharmacological 
interventions: celecoxib (CXB) loaded on an implanted collagen membrane, and 
subcutaneously (SQ) injected ketotifen. Thirty rabbits were randomly divided 
into five groups. The first group received no intervention after the index 
surgery. The remaining four groups underwent intra-articular implantation of 
collagen membranes loaded with or without CXB at the time of the index surgery; 
two of which were also treated with SQ ketotifen. Biomechanical joint 
contracture data were collected at 8, 10, 16, and 24 weeks. At the time of 
necropsy (24 weeks), posterior capsule tissue was collected for messenger RNA 
and histopathologic analyses. At 24 weeks, there was a statistically significant 
increase in passive extension among rabbits in all groups treated with CXB 
and/or ketotifen compared to those in the contracture control group. There was a 
statistically significant decrease in COL3A1, COL6A1, and ACTA2 gene expression 
in the treatment groups compared to the contracture control group (P < .001). 
Histopathologic data also demonstrated a trend towards decreased fibrous tissue 
density in the CXB membrane group compared to the vehicle membrane group. The 
present data suggest that intra-articular placement of a treated collagen 
membrane blunts the severity of contracture development in a rabbit model of 
arthrofibrosis, and that ketotifen and CXB may independently contribute to the 
prevention of arthrofibrosis. Statement of clinical significance: Current 
literature has demonstrated that arthrofibrosis may affect up to 5% of primary 
total knee arthroplasty patients. For that reason, novel pharmacologic 
prophylaxis and treatment modalities are critical to mitigating reoperations and 
revisions while improving the quality of life for patients with this 
debilitating condition.

Histone methylation, which is mediated by the histone lysine (K) 
methyltransferases (HKMTases), is a mechanism associated with many pathways in 
eukaryotes. Most HKMTases have a conserved SET (Su(var) 3-9,E(z),Trithorax) 
domain, while the HKMTases with SET domains are called the SET domain group 
(SDG) proteins. In plants, only SDG proteins can work as HKMTases. In this 
review, we introduced the classification of SDG family proteins in plants and 
the structural characteristics of each subfamily, surmise the functions of SDG 
family members in plant growth and development processes, including pollen and 
female gametophyte development, flowering, plant morphology and the responses to 
stresses. This review will help researchers better understand the SDG proteins 
and histone methylation in plants and lay a basic foundation for further studies 
on SDG proteins.

Hypothesis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and environmental pollutants.

Genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors are relevant in the causation of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a multistep cascade. We suggest that 
exposure to environmental pollutants in early life is one such factor. ALS was 
first described in the 19th century in the context of the Industrial Revolution 
that began more than 50 years earlier. The rising incidence of ALS thereafter 
correlates with increasing longevity, but this is an incomplete association. We 
suggest that increasing exposure to environmental pollutants due to industrial 
activity, acting over a lifetime, is also important. The combination of genetic 
mutations and pollutant exposure, with increased life expectancy, may account 
for the apparent variations in incidence of the disease in different countries 
and continents and even regionally within a given country. This hypothesis is 
testable by focused epidemiological studies, evaluating early and lifelong 
industrial pollutant exposure of differing types, within the Bradford Hill 
framework.

Waste recycling, in particular source separation contribute significantly to the 
extension of landfill life and the evolution of green communities. Factors that 
affect participation in source waste separation amongst Metropolitans 
Johannesburg residents was investigated by social survey using field 
questionnaire data to assess socio-demographic factors and was analysed by 
statistical tools and behavioural constructs i.e. attitudes, subjective norms, 
perceived behavioural control, intentions, and situational factors. The results 
revealed that for graduates, source separation was driven by social 
responsibilities and family size while council awareness campaign, financial 
incentives and provision of recycling facilities are the driving force for 
source separation amongst respondents with matric and lower formal education. 
Family size and level of education are correlated to attitude with low 
correlations. The weak correlation was due to the perception of quality of 
services provided by the council. Incentives are moderators of intention of 
source separation but distances to buyback centre have to be carefully selected 
in order not to be a deterrent. Waste management agencies should accommodate the 
level of formal education and different family size in the formulation of source 
separation program.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most intransigent and aggressive brain tumors, 
and its treatment is extremely challenging and ineffective. To improve patients' 
expectancy and quality of life, new therapeutic approaches were investigated. 
Melatonin is an endogenous indoleamine with an incredible variety of properties. 
Due to evidence demonstrating melatonin's activity against several cancer 
hallmarks, there is growing interest in its use for preventing and treating 
cancer. In this review, we report on the potential effects of melatonin, alone 
or in combination with anticancer drugs, against GBM. We also summarize 
melatonin targets and/or the intracellular pathways involved. Moreover, we 
describe melatonin's epigenetic activity responsible for its antineoplastic 
effects. To date, there are too few clinical studies (involving a small number 
of patients) investigating the antineoplastic effects of melatonin against GBM. 
Nevertheless, these studies described improvement of GBM patients' quality of 
life and did not show significant adverse effects. In this review, we also 
report on studies regarding melatonin-like molecules with the tumor-suppressive 
properties of melatonin together with implemented pharmacokinetics. Melatonin 
effects and mechanisms of action against GBM require more research attention due 
to the unquestionably high potential of this multitasking indoleamine in 
clinical practice.

The purpose of this study was to compare double-handed backhand kinematics of 
the non-dominant wrist of tennis players using either an eastern or continental 
grip position with the non-dominant hand. Trajectory data were captured using 
sixty reflective markers on sixteen sub-elite right-handed tennis players using 
a 12-camera VICON motion capture system (250 Hz). Participants executed 
double-handed backhands using two non-dominant grip positions (Eastern [E] and 
Continental [C]), aiming for two crosscourt zones (Deep [D] and Short [S]), 
totalling to four conditions (ED, CD, ES and CS). Three successful attempts from 
each condition were selected for analysis. The eastern grip demonstrated faster 
horizontal racket head velocity compared to the continental grip. However, no 
differences were observed in accuracy or spin rate between grips (p > 0.05). In 
the non-dominant upper limb, elbow flexion was smaller in the continental 
condition throughout the swing, whilst wrist extension and ulnar deviation was 
larger. Collectively, these data suggest that the continental grip may place the 
wrist in a position vulnerable to overuse injury. Future research into the 
kinetics of the double-handed backhand would help better understand the onset of 
ulnar-side wrist pain in tennis.

Global burden of disease (GBD) refers to the economic and human costs resulting 
from poor health. The disability-adjusted life year is a measure of life lost 
from premature death and life not lived at 100% health. Surgery has long been 
neglected in the distribution of resources for global health. Because of years 
of life lived with a disability and the large proportion of children in a 
population, pediatric musculoskeletal conditions early in life can contribute to 
the GBD. Fortunately, the World Health Organization has recently promoted 
essential surgical services through its Emergency and Essential Surgical Care 
Project and Global Initiative.

Renal transplantation (RT) can improve life expectancy in hemodialysis (HD) 
patients. However, little is known about the outcomes of renal transplant 
recipients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study aimed to 
elucidate the effect of RT on clinical outcomes after PCI. Renal transplant 
recipients who underwent PCI from 2002 to 2017 were enrolled. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of RT, we retrospectively reviewed HD patients who underwent PCI. 
Propensity-score matching was performed using logistic regression to control for 
differences in baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was the incidence 
of major adverse cardiac events. After propensity matching, patients were 
classified into the RT (n = 50) group and HD (n = 50) group. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed that the incidence of major adverse cardiac events was 
significantly lower in the RT group than in the HD group (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 
RT was associated with a lower risk for all-cause death (odds ratio 0.04; 95% 
confidence interval 0.002 to 0.03; p = 0.0054) and target vessel 
revascularization (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.79; p = 0.015). RT may improve 
clinical outcomes after PCI, and it is encouraged for HD patients to increase 
life expectancy and reduce the occurrence of adverse events after PCI. Further 
research would be warranted to support this finding.

Re-imagining cystic fibrosis care: next generation thinking.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common multi-system genetically inherited condition, 
predominately found in individuals of Caucasian decent. Since the identification 
of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in 
1989, and the subsequent improvement in understanding of CF pathophysiology, 
significant increases in life-expectancy have followed. Initially this was 
related to improvements in the management and systems of care for treating the 
various affected organ systems. These cornerstone treatments are still essential 
for CF patients born today. However, over the last decade, the major advance has 
been in therapies that target the resultant genetic defect: the dysfunctional 
CFTR protein. Small molecule agents that target this dysfunctional protein via a 
variety of mechanisms have led to lung function improvements, reductions in 
pulmonary exacerbation rates and increases in weight and quality-of-life 
indices. As more patients receive these agents earlier and earlier in life, it 
is likely that general CF care will increasingly pivot around these specific 
therapies, although it is also likely that effects other than those identified 
in the initial trials will be discovered and need to be managed. Despite great 
excitement for modulator therapies, they are unlikely to be suitable or 
available for all; whether this is due to a lack of availability for specific 
CFTR mutations, drug-reactions or the health economic set-up in certain 
countries. Nevertheless, the CF community must be applauded for its ongoing 
focus on research and development for this life-limiting disease. With time, 
personalised individualised therapy would ideally be the mainstay of CF care.
