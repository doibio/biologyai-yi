named by the general practitioners are closely interrelated: the reform of 
social care would support the health care system and vice versa. More effective 
operation of the health and social care systems would ease the burdens of 
families, and at the same time encourage more active participation of families 
in the care process. And the systematic education of society and communities is 
a long-term investment that would strengthen a positive attitude towards old age 
and a value-oriented view of the ageing process that is one of the basic 
conditions for successful social integration of the elderly. Orv Hetil. 2018;

AIM: To elicit patients' preferences for HIV/AIDS treatment characteristics in 
Colombia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A best-worst scaling case was used to provide a ranking 
of 26 HIV/AIDS treatment characteristics that were similar to a previous study 
conducted in Germany. In each choice task, participants were asked to choose the 
most important and the least important treatment characteristics from a set of 
five from the master list. Using the Hierarchical Bayes method, relative 
importance scores were calculated. Sub-group analyses were conducted according 
to sex, education, source of infection, symptoms, and age.
RESULTS: A total of 195 patients fully completed the questionnaire. The three 
most important characteristics were "drug has very high efficacy" (relative 
importance score [RIS] = 10.1), "maximum prolongation of life expectancy" 
(RIS = 9.7), and "long duration of efficacy" (RIS = 7.4). Sub-group analysis 
showed only three significant (but minor) differences between older and younger 
people.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that treatment characteristics regarding 
efficacy and prolongation of life are particularly important for patients in 
Colombia. Further investigation on how patients make trade-offs between these 
important characteristics and incorporating this information in clinical and 
policy decision-making would be needed to improve adherence with HIV/AIDS 
medication.

The effects of thermosonication (TS) and 100 ppm nisin-assisted TS (TS + nisin) 
on the inactivation of naturally occurring microorganisms, retention of 
nutritional quality and extension of shelf life of fresh apple juice were 
evaluated, with nisin and mild heat (nisin + MH) treatments as control. Fresh 
apple juice was addressed by nisin + MH, TS and TS + nisin at 37, 42, 47, and 
52 °C for 5-40 min. After processing, microbial growth was evaluated during 
storage at 8 °C at every 5 days. Temperature played a vital role in the 
inactivation of aerobic bacteria and yeasts and molds by TS and TS + nisin, 
higher temperature up to 52 °C could cause a considerable inactivation of 
microbial cells in apple juice. As apple juice was subjected to TS and 
TS + nisin at 52 °C for 30 min, retention of original quality including 89% 
ascorbic acid, non-visible color change, no significant alteration in BD, pH, TA 
and TSS values of fresh apple juice, and extension shelf life to 15 d at 8 °C 
were obtained. Nisin exhibit additional inactivation effect of aerobic bacteria 
in apple juice while not obviously effect on yeast and molds. These results 
indicated a potential application of TS and TS + nisin (100 ppm) to produce 
fresh-like quality apple juice and/or to extend its shelf life.

PURPOSE: Clinical pathways increase compliance with treatment guidelines, 
improve outcomes, and reduce costs. Guidelines recommend single fraction 
radiation therapy (SFRT) for palliation of uncomplicated bone metastases, but 
implementation is variable. We examined the effects of a pathway tool on SFRT 
rates in an academic radiation oncology practice.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using published literature, clinical guidelines, and 
expert input, we designed a clinical pathway for bone metastases radiation 
therapy displayed on a Web-based electronic interface. In March 2016, the 
pathway launched on a palliative radiation service at the Dana Farber/Brigham 
and Women's Cancer Center main campus and at affiliated community sites. 
Providers were surveyed pre- and postimplementation to assess expectations and 
elicit feedback. Rates of pathway utilization, compliance with SFRT 
recommendations, and reasons for noncompliance were assessed.
RESULTS: The final pathway includes 20 endpoints and several validated 
prognostic scoring systems. It was used in 38% of 723 bone metastases radiation 
prescriptions, with appropriate SFRT rates rising from 18% before implementation 
to 48% after launch (P < .01). Major reasons for rejecting recommendations 
included disagreement with life expectancy prognostication and patient 
convenience. The pathway increased physicians' confidence regarding compliance 
with treatment guidelines and made it easier to find well-supported treatment 
recommendations. Workflow disruptions and the inability to handle nuanced 
situations emerged as limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates the utility of clinical pathway 
decision support for bone metastases radiation in complex academic settings. 
Next steps include increasing the pathway's ease of use, refining the pathway's 
prognostic abilities, and measuring cost savings related to the pathway.

Data quality issues at advanced old age, such as incompleteness of registration 
of vital events and age misreporting, compromise estimates of the death rates 
and remaining life expectancy at those ages. Following up on Horiuchi and Coale 
(Population Studies 36: 317-326, 1982), Mitra (Population Studies 38: 313-319, 
1984, Population Studies 39: 511-512, 1985), and Coale (Population Studies 39: 
507-509, 1985), we examine the conventional approaches to constructing life 
tables from data deficient at advanced ages and the two adjustment methods by 
the mentioned authors. Contrary to earlier reports by Horiuchi, Coale, and 
Mitra, we show that the two methods are consistent and useful in drastically 
reducing the estimation errors in life expectancy as compared to the 
conventional approaches, i.e., the classical open age interval model and 
extrapolation of the death rates. Our results suggest complementing the 
classical estimates of life expectancy by adjustments using Horiuchi-Coale, 
Mitra, or other appropriate methods and avoiding the extrapolation method as a 
tool for estimating the life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Due to increasing life expectancy, the number of older patients 
harboring a meningioma is expected to increase. We determined whether 
preoperative variables and postoperative clinical outcome differ between younger 
and older adults.
METHODS: Medical records of meningioma patients were retrospectively analyzed. 
Preoperative variables were age, gender, neurological symptoms, Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 
(ASA)-classification and tumor characteristics. Clinical outcome was assessed 
using complication rates, length of hospital stay and destination after 
discharge. After 6-12 and 12-18-month KPS, neurological symptoms and Glasgow 
Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were assessed for older (age ≥ 65 years) and younger 
adults (18-65 years) using Mann-Whitney U, T test, Pearson's Chi square or 
Fisher's exact.
RESULTS: 89 patients were included (23 ≥ 65 years). Before surgery, older 
patients scored higher on ASA classification (p = 0.003) and lower on KPS 
(p = 0.017). There was no significant difference postoperatively in mortality, 
complications and duration of hospital stay. Less older patients were discharged 
directly to home compared to younger adults (52 vs 80%, respectively; 
p = 0.004). In surviving patients, less older subjects had a good recovery (GOS 
4-5) at 6-12 months' follow-up compared to younger subjects (64 vs 93%, 
respectively; p = 0.035). At 12-18 months, there was no significant difference 
in good recovery between both age groups (82 vs 92%).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, outcome was worse for patients ≥ 65 years old in 
terms of discharge destination and good recovery at 6-12 months. At 12-18 months 
follow-up, older subjects performed not significantly different from younger 
ones. Careful patient selection seems essential to reach good results in 
meningioma surgery for patients ≥ 65 years old.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with schizophrenia have shorter life expectancy and one 
of the main causes of death is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Modifiable risk 
factors for CVD include diabetes mellitus (DM) and dyslipidaemia. This study 
aimed to establish: (a) the prevalence and correlates of DM and dyslipidaemia; 
(b) the proportion of those whose condition was well controlled; and (c) the 
incidence of undiagnosed DM and dyslipidaemia in a long-stay inpatient 
schizophrenia population.
METHODS: Data was collected to assess the physical health status of 110 
inpatients with schizophrenia who had been in hospital for over one year. 
Information on sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of physical and 
mental illnesses, and current medications was obtained from their medical 
records. The overall prevalence of DM and dyslipidaemia was based on diagnosis 
in the medical records, current medications and fasting blood test results.
RESULTS: The patient group was predominantly male (85.5%), with a mean age of 
55.9 ± 9.9 (range 25-90) years. Overall prevalence of DM and dyslipidaemia was 
19.1% and 62.7%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed 
that Malay (odds ratio [OR] 14.97) and Indian (OR 25.71) patients were 
significantly more likely to have DM when compared to Chinese patients.
CONCLUSION: In comparison to the general population, the prevalence of DM and 
dyslipidaemia was found to be higher in inpatients with schizophrenia. However, 
the two chronic illnesses were well controlled in inpatients and few were 
undiagnosed, perhaps due to the regular monitoring, supervised diet and regular 
physical activities arranged for inpatients in the long-stay inpatient wards.

[Scientific potential of phenomics - functional direction of genetics].

[Article in Russian]

Marasanov AV, Valtseva EA.

In this paper on the based on the integration of known theories, doctrines and 
concepts - principles of consistency and self-regulation of physiological 
functions (Pavlov I.P., 1950), the theory offunctional systems (Anokhin P.K., 
1973), the theory of adaptive reactions (Selye H., 1960 ; Garkavi LKh et al, 
1979), the doctrine of the dominant (Ukhtomsky A.A., 1966), doctrine on health 
(Baevsky R.M.), doctrine on the body type of the human by Merlin VS. conception 
on the “the interrelationship between the function and genetic apparatus” by 
Meyerson F.Z., Pshennikova M.G., Platonov V.N., and others, there is proposed to 
select phenomics - functional division of genetics considering the poolability 
of specific mechanisms of the body in an integral system of the adaptive act in 
favor of the development of a personalized approach to the diagnosis and 
prevention of non-communicable diseases, increasing life expectancy of working 
age into the particular scientific direction. The task of phenomics is the 
establishment of the phenotypic characteristics of the person, norms of the 
response of systems of his body, determination of the deviation of the level of 
the functioning of the each system from the norm of its response and the 
elaboration of the tactics for the correction of the functional state of the 
organism (the optimization of its life activity), with taking into account the 
directedness of the interaction of body systems. The description of the shaping 
of the mechanism of stereotyped response of the organism generated an important 
contribution to the development of phenomics. Stereotyped response being 
initiated by the non-specific response of the body is aimed at the shaping of 
the activity of its systems after a fashion of norms of the activity, promotes 
the recovery of the specificity of the body, plays an important role in the 
establishment of cause-effect relations of the disease.

Qualitative index of population health losses in the aral sea region.

[Article in English, Russian]

Sakiev KZ, Ibraeva LK, Dyusembaeva NK, Rybalkina DK, Drobchenko EA.

The article is devoted to the approbation of the modification of the method of 
the presentation of indices of medical and social losses of the population on an 
example of environmentally unfavorable Aral Sea region in Kazakhstan. The first 
step in improvement of the system ofpublic health care is the identification of 
the most important problems related with the assessment of the disease burden 
and the adjustment of data of such type in accordance national aims on the 
decline of medical and social losses in this problem area. So far according to 
the criteria for the determination of the boundary of ecological catastrophe 
area one of the indices is the steady gain in the mortality rate. Using the 
index “Years of Life Lost” (YLL) in medical statistics as a relatively new 
approach that continues to be improved and its development supposes the 
improvement in the quality of health statistics. We modified this method 
consisting in the determination of the coefficient of loss of years. In the 
given work after comprehensive analysis of the loss of years due to morbidity 
and mortality on the base of life tables the potential of lost years for the 
population was determined with bearing in mind of module tables and compared 
with the loss in years due to the health loss. So far there was declined the 
dimension of the comprehensive index, there was elevated its comparability with 
other indices, and the data interpretation has been optimized. Suggested 
modification can be used for a comprehensive assessment of health state in the 
execution of epidemiological studies and monitoring of medical and social 
situation in ecologically unfavorable regions.

Well-defined ordered arrays of plasmonic nanostructures were fabricated on 
stretchable substrates and tunable plasmon-coupling-based sensing properties 
were comprehensively demonstrated upon extension and contraction. Regular 
nanoprism patterns consisting of Ag, Au and Ag/Au bilayers were constructed on 
the stretchable polydimethylsiloxane substrate. The nanoprisms had the same 
orientation over the entire substrate (3 × 3 cm2) via metal deposition on a 
single-crystal microparticle monolayer assembly. The plasmonic sensor based on 
the Ag/Au bilayer showed a 6-fold enhanced surface enhanced Raman scattering 
signal under 20% uniaxial extension, whereas a 3-fold increase was observed upon 
6% contraction, compared with the Au nanoprism arrays. The sensory behaviors 
were corroborated by finite-difference time-domain simulation, demonstrating the 
tunable electromagnetic field enhancement effect via the localized surface 
plasmon resonance coupling. The advanced flexible plasmonic-coupling-based 
devices with tunable and quantifiable performance herein suggested are expected 
to unlock promising potential in practical bio-sensing, biotechnological 
applications and optical devices.

BACKGROUND: In Western Europe, currently only Ireland and Portugal continue to 
provide universal neonatal bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programs, 
despite not being considered as high tuberculosis (TB) incidence countries. 
Other European countries only vaccinate infants considered at high risk of 
contracting TB. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of selective BCG vaccination 
compared with strategies of universal and no vaccination.
METHODS: An economic model was used to simulate a cohort from birth to life 
expectancy, taking the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system. BCG 
protection was modeled to last 15 years. International vaccine efficacy data 
were combined with Irish epidemiologic and cost data. The model took into 
account long-term sequelae associated with TB meningitis and severe adverse 
reactions relating to the BCG vaccine. A fully probabilistic model was used to 
incorporate uncertainty across all parameters.
RESULTS: At &OV0556;139,557 per quality-adjusted life year, selective 
vaccination was not cost-effective relative to a program of no vaccination. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination was &OV0556;2.55 million 
per quality-adjusted life year relative to selective vaccination. There was 
substantial uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of BCG vaccination. The 
cost-effectiveness of selective vaccination could be substantially improved by 
reducing the cost of administering the vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of changes to other aspects of TB control, a switch 
to selective vaccination will result in increased cases of childhood TB. 
Although not considered cost-effective, selective vaccination may be preferable 
to no vaccination until other changes to TB control may be implemented to reduce 
the risk of TB in children.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic disorder of unknown etiology 
and is characterized by chronic inflammation and synovial infiltration of immune 
cells. RA is associated with decreased life expectancy and quality of life. The 
research on RA is greatly simplified by animal models that help us to 
investigate the complex system involving inflammation, immunological tolerance 
and autoimmunity. The animal models of RA with a proven track record of 
predictability for efficacy in humans include: collagen type II induced 
arthritis in rats as well as mice, adjuvant induced arthritis in rats and 
antigen induced arthritis in several species. The development of novel 
treatments for RA requires the interplay between clinical observations and 
studies in animal models. However, each model features a different mechanism 
driving the disease expression; the benefits of each should be evaluated 
carefully in making the appropriate choice for the scientific problem to be 
investigated. In this review article, we focus on animal models of arthritis 
induced in various species along with the genetic models. The review also 
discussed the similarity and dissimilarities with respect to human RA.

BACKGROUND: The Eastern Mediterranean region has the second highest number of 
road traffic injury mortality rates after the African region based on 2013 data, 
with road traffic injuries accounting for 27% of the total injury mortality in 
the region. Globally the number of road traffic deaths has plateaued despite an 
increase in motorization, but it is uncertain whether this applies to the 
Region. This study investigated the regional trends in both road traffic injury 
mortality and morbidity and examined country-based differences considering on 
income level, categories of road users, and gender distribution.
METHODS: Register-based ecological study linking data from Global Burden of 
Disease Study with the United Nations Statistics Division for population and 
World Bank definition for country income level. Road traffic injury mortality 
rates and disability-adjusted life years were compiled for all ages at country 
level in 1995, 2005, 2015 and combined for a regional average (n = 22) and a 
global average (n = 122). The data were stratified by country economic level, 
road user category and gender.
RESULTS: Road traffic injury mortality rates in the Region were higher than the 
global average for all three reference years but suggest a downward trend. In 
2015 mortality rates were more than twice as high in low and high income 
countries compared to global income averages and motor vehicle occupants had a 
3-fold greater mortality than the global average. Severe injuries decreased by 
more than half for high/middle income countries but remained high for low income 
countries; three times higher for males than females.
CONCLUSION: Despite a potential downward trend, inequalities in road traffic 
injury mortality and morbidity burden remain high in the Eastern Mediterranean 
region. Action needs to be intensified and targeted to implement and enforce 
safety measures that prevent and mitigate severe motor vehicle crashes in high 
income countries especially and invest in efforts to promote public, active 
transport for vulnerable road users in the resource poor countries of the 
Region.

BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death and illness globally among 
children younger than 5 years. Mortality and short-term morbidity cause 
substantial burden of disease but probably underestimate the true effect of 
diarrhoea on population health. This underestimation is because diarrhoeal 
diseases can negatively affect early childhood growth, probably through enteric 
dysfunction and impaired uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients. We attempt 
to quantify the long-term sequelae associated with childhood growth impairment 
due to diarrhoea.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
framework and leveraged existing estimates of diarrhoea incidence, childhood 
undernutrition, and infectious disease burden to estimate the effect of 
diarrhoeal diseases on physical growth, including weight and height, and 
subsequent disease among children younger than 5 years. The burden of diarrhoea 
was measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a composite metric of 
mortality and morbidity. We hypothesised that diarrhoea is negatively associated 
with three common markers of growth: weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and 
height-for-age Z-scores. On the basis of these undernutrition exposures, we 
applied a counterfactual approach to quantify the relative risk of infectious 
disease (subsequent diarrhoea, lower respiratory infection, and measles) and 
protein energy malnutrition morbidity and mortality per day of diarrhoea and 
quantified the burden of diarrhoeal disease due to these outcomes caused by 
undernutrition.
FINDINGS: Diarrhoea episodes are significantly associated with childhood growth 
faltering. We found that each day of diarrhoea was associated with 
height-for-age Z-score (-0·0033 [95% CI -0·0024 to -0·0041]; p=4·43 × 10-14), 
weight-for-age Z-score (-0·0077 [-0·0058 to -0·0097]; p=3·19 × 10-15), and 
weight-for-height Z-score (-0·0096 [-0·0067 to -0·0125]; p=7·78 × 10-11). After 
addition of the DALYs due to the long-term sequelae as a consequence of 
undernutrition, the burden of diarrhoeal diseases increased by 39·0% (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 33·0-46·6) and was responsible for 55 778 000 DALYs 
(95% UI 49 125 400-62 396 200) among children younger than 5 years in 2016. 
Among the 15 652 300 DALYs (95% UI 12 951 300-18 806 100) associated with 
undernutrition due to diarrhoeal episodes, more than 84·7% are due to increased 
risk of infectious disease, whereas the remaining 15·3% of long-term DALYs are 
due to increased prevalence of protein energy malnutrition. The burden of 
diarrhoea has decreased substantially since 1990, but progress has been greater 
in long-term (78·7% reduction [95% UI 69·3-85·5]) than in acute (70·4% reduction 
[95% UI 61·7-76·5]) DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: Diarrhoea represents an even larger burden of disease than was 
estimated in the Global Burden of Disease Study. In order to adequately address 
the burden of its long-term sequelae, a renewed emphasis on controlling the risk 
of diarrhoea incidence may be required. This renewed effort can help further 
prevent the potential lifelong cost on child health, growth, and overall 
potential.

BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma with squamous differentiation (PTC-SD) 
is a poorly understood pathologic finding of unknown clinical significance. 
Selected case reports have suggested that PTC-SD is an aggressive tumor with a 
poor prognosis. Here we present the largest case series of PTC-SD reported in 
the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cancer registry at our tertiary care referral center 
was reviewed to identify all patients from 1995-2015 who had been diagnosed with 
PTC-SD on initial total thyroidectomy or lymph node dissection for recurrent 
disease. All cases were reviewed by an endocrine pathologist to confirm the 
diagnosis. Patient demographic, pathology, and outcomes data were collected and 
reviewed.
RESULTS: During the study period, ten patients were diagnosed with PTC-SD, six 
in the primary tumor at the time of initial surgery, and four in lymph node 
metastases during surgery for recurrent disease. The median age at diagnosis was 
56 y and half of the patients were male. Aggressive features such as 
multifocality (67%), extrathyroidal extension (67%), positive margin (89%), 
lymph node metastases (80%), and extranodal extension (60%) were far more 
prominent than is typically seen in classic PTC. Long-term follow-up (median 
56.5 mo) demonstrated high rates of locoregional recurrence (60%), pulmonary 
metastases (30%), and mortality (10%).
CONCLUSIONS: Squamous differentiation is a rare finding in PTC that is 
associated with aggressive pathologic features and poor long-term outcomes. This 
phenomenon may represent a step in progression toward dedifferentiation; thus, 
patients with PTC-SD should have close, life-long surveillance and should be 
treated according to evidence-based guidelines for high-risk thyroid cancers.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high incidence of metastatic breast cancer and its 
related mortality in the elderly population, our knowledge about optimal 
treatment for older patients with cancer is far from adequate. We aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy of dual anti-HER2 treatment with or without metronomic 
chemotherapy in older patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in 30 
centres from eight countries in Europe, in patients with histologically proven, 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, without previous chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease, who were 70 years or older, or 60 years or older with 
confirmed functional restrictions defined by protocol, and had a life expectancy 
of more than 12 weeks and a performance status according to WHO scale of 0-3. 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online randomisation system 
based on the minimisation method to receive metronomic oral cyclophosphamide 50 
mg per day plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, or trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone. 
Trastuzumab was given intravenously with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 
6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was given intravenously with a loading dose of 
840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified by hormone 
receptor positivity, previous HER2 treatment, and baseline geriatric screening. 
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival at 6 
months as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. 
A difference of 10% or greater between the two groups was sought. Efficacy 
analyses were by intention to treat; safety was assessed in all patients who 
received at least one dose of study treatment. In case of progression, all 
patients were offered trastuzumab emtansine. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01597414, and is completed.
FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2013, and May 10, 2016, 80 patients, of whom 56 (70%) 
had a potential frailty profile according to the geriatric screening G8 score 
(≤14), were randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab (n=39) or 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (n=41). 
Estimated progression-free survival at 6 months was 46·2% (95% CI 30·2-60·7) 
with trastuzumab and pertuzumab versus 73·4% (56·6-84·6) with trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 
0·37-1·12], p=0·12). At a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 12·5-30·4), the 
median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6-16·8) with 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab versus 12·7 months (6·7-24·8) with the addition of 
metronomic oral cyclophosphamide. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events 
were hypertension (in six [15%] of 39 patients in the trastuzumab and pertuzumab 
group vs five [12%] of 41 in the trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus metronomic oral 
cyclophosphamide group), diarrhoea (four [10%] vs five [12%]), dyspnoea (two 
[5%] vs four [10%]), fatigue (three [8%] vs two [5%]), pain (two [5%] vs two 
[5%]), and a thromboembolic event (0 [0%] vs four [10%]). Severe cardiac 
toxicities were occasionally observed in both groups. In the trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab group four patients died without progression, due to cardiac arrest 
during treatment (n=1), peritoneal infection (n=1), respiratory failure (n=1), 
and sudden death without a specified cause (n=1). In the trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide group, one patient died from 
heart failure.
INTERPRETATION: Addition of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to trastuzumab plus 
pertuzumab in older and frail patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast 
cancer increased median progression-free survival by 7 months compared with dual 
HER2 blockade alone, with an acceptable safety profile. Trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide, followed by trastuzumab 
emtansine after disease progression, might delay or supersede the need for 
taxane chemotherapy in this population.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational.
OBJECTIVES: To compare results of several different methods for calculating life 
expectancy in the same sample of people with spinal cord injury (SCI), and 
critically assess their advantages and disadvantages.
SETTING: Two spinal centres in Great Britain.
METHODS: Survival status of persons with traumatic SCI injured between 1943 and 
2010 with follow-up to 2015 was determined. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) 
were calculated using age at injury and current (attained) age, and compared. 
Life expectancy was then estimated using the SMR methods and compared with the 
results of a method based on multivariate logistic regression of a person-year 
dataset. Life expectancy estimates calculated by applying SMRs based on current 
age to general population period (current) and cohort (projected) life tables 
were also compared.
RESULTS: The estimated life expectancies were significantly higher when the SMRs 
were based on age at injury. They were also higher when a general population 
cohort life table was used, particularly for younger ages. With the exception of 
the ventilator-dependent group, the life expectancy estimates derived from 
logistic regression were slightly lower than those derived from SMRs based on 
current age and a general population period life table.
CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate logistic regression of person-years method offers 
several advantages compared to the SMR method for calculating life expectancy 
after SCI, the main ones being: greater statistical power and precision with 
smaller sample sizes, the ability to include more predictive factors and to 
distinguish the otherwise confounded effects of current age, time post-injury, 
and calendar time.

Resveratrol is a flavonoid with a stilbene structure that is able to suppress 
acute pulmonary thromboembolism-induced pulmonary artery hypertension. 
Furthermore, it possesses anti-cancer and antioxidant properties, is able to 
regulate blood lipids and increase life expectancy. In the present study, it was 
evaluated whether the protective effect of resveratrol was able to improve 
cardiovascular function in rats with diabetes. The effects of resveratrol on 
blood glucose, body weight, heart/body weight ratio, plasma triglyceride levels, 
heart rate, aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio and 
total plasma insulin were evaluated. Levels of inflammation and oxidative stress 
were also evaluated using ELISA kits, and the expressions of endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
phosphorylated (p)-p38 protein were evaluated via western blot analysis. The 
results demonstrated that administration of resveratrol in rats with 
diabetes-related myocardial infarction (DRMI) significantly reduced blood 
glucose, body weight, plasma triglyceride levels, heart rate and AST/ALT ratio 
(all P<0.01) and significantly increased total plasma insulin (P<0.01). 
Furthermore, resveratrol significantly reduced levels of inflammation factors 
(P<0.01) and malondialdehyde, a marker for oxidative stress, in rats with DRMI 
(P<0.01). Resveratrol significantly increased the expression of eNOS (P<0.01) 
and suppressed the expression of VEGF and p-p38 (both P<0.01) in rats with DRMI. 
These results suggest that treatment with resveratrol is able to improve 
cardiovascular function via inhibition of eNOS and VEGF, and suppression of p38 
phosphorylation in rats with DRMI.

INTRODUCTION: The systemic inflammatory nature of systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) is well patent not only in the diverse clinical manifestations of the 
disease but also in the increased risk of premature atherosclerosis and 
cardiovascular events (CVE), making SLE one of the most complex diseases to 
study and manage in clinical practice.
AIM: To travel from old aspects to modern insights on the physiopathology, new 
molecular biomarkers, imaging methods of atherosclerosis assessment, and the 
potential treatments of atherosclerosis in SLE.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search using PubMed database and performed a 
critical review.
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: Several developments have taken place in the 
understanding of the relationship between SLE and premature atherosclerosis. 
Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases are still the major cause of reduced life 
expectancy in SLE and the main cause of death. The lack of standardization 
methods for the imaging assessment of atherosclerosis in SLE and the 
multifactorial nature of the disease are well patriated in the difficulty of 
achieving consistent and reproducible results among studies that focus in 
cardiovascular risk assessment and prediction. A raising number of molecular 
biomarkers of atherosclerosis have been proposed, but the combination of several 
biomarkers and risk factors may better estimate cardiovascular disease risk. 
Moreover, the development of effective therapies to prevent progression of 
atherosclerosis and CVE shall address systemic inflammation.

Initiative to improve the cardiogenic safety of antipsychotic medication in 
community mental health patients.

Serious mental illness is reported to reduce a patient's life expectancy by 
15-20 years. This disparity is thought to be related to lifestyle factors, 
access to healthcare, poor health monitoring and the common use of 
antipsychotics, which can cause serious metabolic and cardiogenic side effects. 
Therefore, to reduce the risk of cardiac complications, both national and local 
guidance recommends annual ECG monitoring for patients on antipsychotics. 
Unfortunately this monitoring is not completed consistently at Manchester Mental 
Health and Social Care Trust, especially within community mental health teams. A 
small team of healthcare professionals conducted a quality improvement (QI) 
project from June 2015 to May 2016 with the aim of addressing this deficiency in 
care. A multidisciplinary approach was used to implement improvement in four key 
areas. Awareness of the need for monitoring, patient engagement with this 
process, identification of patients requiring monitoring and access to ECG 
equipment were all addressed as separate primary drivers for change over an 
8-month period using a 'Plan Do Study Act' model of QI. Outcome, process and 
balancing measures were gathered monthly to track progress and improvement 
following the application of change. Compliance with annual ECG monitoring 
nearly doubled throughout the course of the project from 43% in June 2015 to a 
peak of 83% in February 2016. Improvement appeared to be sustained as the 
percentage of patients receiving the required monitoring remained significantly 
higher than baseline even after no further change interventions were being 
implemented (76%, 71%, 77%, March, April, May 2016). This QI project has shown 
that improvements can be made and has documented a recipe for how this change 
was achieved.
