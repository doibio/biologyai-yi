BACKGROUND: The extension of the life span has led to an increase in the number 
of older people and an increase in the prevalence of disability in people over 
60 years of age. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ADL and 
IADL disability and to analyze its determinants among people aged 60 and older 
living in southeastern Poland.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out among a randomly selected, 
representative population of people aged 60 and older living in southeastern 
Poland. Disability was assessed using the Katz Index of Independence in Basic 
Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Logistic 
regression models were used to identify the factors related to ADLs and IADLs. 
For the variables that were included in the above models, their clustered 
influence on the increase in the odds ratio for the occurrence of an ADL or IADL 
limitation was also examined.
RESULTS: The research results show that 35.75% of the participants reported at 
least one problem with IADLs. At least one problem with ADLs was reported by 
17.13% of the participants. The most significant modifiable factors influencing 
the occurrence of disability were the presence of barriers in the participant's 
environment, poor relations with relatives, a lack of social contacts, 
multimorbidity and pain. A multiple increase in the odds ratio of disability was 
found with the presence of pairs of analyzed factors. The highest odds ratio of 
at least one ADL limitation was observed for the combination of barriers in the 
participant's environment with multimorbidity (OR 74.07). With regard to IADL 
disability, the highest odds ratio was observed for the combination of pain on 
the VAS scale ≥3 points with older age (OR 19.47).
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a high prevalence of ADL and IADL disability in 
older people living in southeastern Poland. It also indicated the extent to 
which modifiable factors influenced the occurrence of disability and the extent 
to which the risk of disability increased with the presence of pairs of factors, 
especially those that included environmental barriers in the participant's 
environment.

RATIONALE: Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly 
contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity 
and mortality. In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of 
frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.
METHODS: To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior 
patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a 
particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet 
advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, 
assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle 
mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance 
measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s 
CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in 
plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells.
RESULTS: Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle 
mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more 
effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, 
p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron 
flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative 
stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter 
walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support 
might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly 
malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also 
cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of mitochondria bioenergetics.

Ambient and household air pollution is a major health problem worldwide, 
contributing annually to approximately seven million of all-cause avoidable 
deaths, shorter life expectancy, and significant direct and indirect costs for 
the community. Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate 
materials that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each 
material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental 
and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2.5 exerts 
adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing 
substantially (mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and 
inflammation) to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart 
failure, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we 
summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular 
adverse effects of short-and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, 
particularly for the PM2.5 size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent 
data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular 
disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than what has 
been thought up to now.

In many developed countries, human life expectancy has doubled over the last 180 
years. Underlying this higher life expectancy is a change in how we age. 
Biomarkers of ageing are used to quantify changes in the aging process and to 
determine biological age. Perceived age is such a biomarker that correlates with 
biological age. Here we present a unique database rich with possibilities to 
study the human ageing process. Using perceived age enables us to collect large 
amounts of data on biological age through a citizen science project, where 
people upload facial pictures and guess the ages of other people at 
www.ageguess.org . The data on perceived age we present here span birth cohorts 
from the years 1877 to 2012. The database currently contains around 220,000 
perceived age guesses. Almost 4500 citizen scientists from over 120 countries of 
origin have uploaded ~4700 facial photographs. Beyond studying the ageing 
process, the data present a wealth of possibilities to study how humans guess 
ages and who is better at guessing ages.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiotherapy, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung 
Hospital, Delhi, India.

CONTEXT: A significant number of patients with head-and-neck cancers have an 
incurable disease with limited life expectancy. The objective of the present 
study was to compare two different short courses of hypofractionated palliative 
radiotherapy regimens to evaluate symptoms, disease response, and acute 
toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously untreated 50 patients of Stage IV B and IV C 
head and neck cancers were randomized to receive conventional hypofractionated 
palliative radiotherapy 30 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks (control group) or Quad Shot 
regimen (study group) 14 Gy in 4 fractions given twice a day at least 6 h apart 
for 2 consecutive days. This regimen was repeated at 4 weekly intervals for a 
further two courses if there was no tumor progression.
RESULTS: Symptom relief was similar among the two schedules for pain (60.86 vs. 
57.17), dysphagia (60.86 vs. 52.17%), and hoarseness (43.85 vs. 38.09%). Overall 
response (that is partial response and stable disease) was seen in majority 
(>70%) of the patients in both the groups. Treatment was very well tolerated 
with no patient experiencing more than Grade 3 toxicity in the control group and 
Grade 2 toxicity in the study group.
CONCLUSIONS: Quad Shot regimen is an effective hypofractionated palliative 
radiotherapy schedule with minimal toxicity, good symptom relief, and response 
rate as compared to conventionally used regimen (30 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks).

This work presents a deeper pharmacological evaluation of two formerly prepared 
and characterized, and highly in vitro cytotoxic platinum(II) oxalato complexes 
[Pt(ox)(L1)2] (1) and [Pt(ox)(L2)2] (2), containing the derivatives of 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi) seliciclib ((R)-roscovitine, CYC202) 
coordinating as N-donor carrier ligands, i.e., 
2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-N6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-9-isopropyladenine (L1) and 
2-chloro-N6-(2,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-9-isopropyladenine (L2). The positive results 
of in vitro cytotoxicity screening on human cancer cell lines (HeLa, HOS, A2780, 
A2780R, G361 and MCF7 with IC50 at low micromolar levels) published previously, 
motivated us to perform extended preclinical in vitro experiments to reveal the 
mechanisms associated with the induction of cancer cell death. In addition, the 
in vivo antitumor activity was evaluated using the mouse lymphocytic leukaemia 
L1210 model. The obtained results revealed that complex 1 exceeds the antitumor 
effect of cisplatin (as for the extension of life-span of mice) and shows far 
less adverse effects as compared to reference drug cisplatin. The in vitro and 
ex vivo studies of cellular effects and molecular mechanisms of cell death 
induction showed that the mechanism of action of complex 1 is essentially 
different from that of cisplatin. The obtained results showed a possible way how 
to obtain antitumor active platinum(II) oxalato complexes with better 
therapeutic profile than contemporary used platinum-based therapeutics.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the real-world (RW) cost-effectiveness of carfilzomib in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) versus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients after one to three 
prior therapies.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model that included three health states 
(progression-free, progressed disease and death) was built. Progression-free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and time to discontinuation (TTD) data for 
the Rd arm were derived using the Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies in the 
Czech Republic; the relative treatment effects of KRd versus Rd were estimated 
from the phase 3, randomised, ASPIRE trial, and were used to predict PFS, OS and 
TTD for KRd. The model was developed from the payer perspective and included 
drug costs, administration costs, monitoring costs, palliative care costs and 
adverse-event related costs collected from Czech sources.
RESULTS: The base case incremental cost effectiveness ratio for KRd compared 
with Rd was €73,156 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Patients on 
KRd incurred costs of €117,534 over their lifetime compared with €53,165 for 
patients on Rd. The QALYs gained were 2.63 and 1.75 for patients on KRd and Rd, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining the strengths of randomised controlled trials and 
observational databases in cost-effectiveness models can generate 
policy-relevant results to allow well-informed decision-making. The current 
model showed that KRd is likely to be cost-effective versus Rd in the RW and, 
therefore, the reimbursement of KRd represents an efficient allocation of 
resources within the healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication can reduce the 
prevalence of gastric cancer. However, whether H. pylori eradication therapy 
should be performed in infected patients, especially in asymptomatic cases, is 
still controversial.
AIMS: The aims of this study were to determine whether H. pylori screening and 
eradication could prevent gastric cancer in a cost-effective way, and further 
whether eradication therapy should be administered to asymptomatic individuals.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model. We 
established two groups, each with 10,000 hypothetical Chinese individuals at the 
age of 40 years. Clinical outcomes and cost of H. pylori eradication were 
compared between the eradication and control groups.
RESULTS: There was a lower morbidity with gastric cancer in the eradication 
group than in the control group, which was most significant after running the 
model for 15 years. The eradication group experienced an average of 34.64 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per person, and the average cost was US 
$1706.52 per person. The control group exhibited an average of 32.63 QALYs per 
person, and the average cost was US $2045.10 per person. The cost-effectiveness 
analysis showed that eradication saved $1539 per LY per person and $168.45 per 
QALY per person.
CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori screening and eradication therapy effectively reduces the 
morbidity of gastric cancer and cancer-related costs in asymptomatic infected 
individuals. Therefore, we believe that H. pylori eradication can prevent 
gastric cancer in a cost-effective way.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in comparison with standard wound 
management after initial surgical wound debridement in adults with severe open 
fractures of the lower limb.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective 
of the United Kingdom NHS and Personal Social Services, based on evidence from 
the 460 participants in the Wound Management of Open Lower Limb Fractures 
(WOLLF) trial. Economic outcomes were collected prospectively over the 12-month 
follow-up period using trial case report forms and participant-completed 
questionnaires. Bivariate regression of costs (given in £, 2014 to 2015 prices) 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with multiple imputation of missing 
data, was conducted to estimate the incremental cost per QALY gained associated 
with NPWT dressings. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were undertaken to assess 
the impacts of uncertainty and heterogeneity, respectively, surrounding aspects 
of the economic evaluation.
RESULTS: The base case analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of £267 910 per QALY gained, reflecting higher costs on average (£678; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -£1082 to £2438) and only marginally higher QALYS 
(0.002; 95% CI -0.054 to 0.059) in the NPWT group. The probability that NPWT is 
cost-effective in this patient population did not exceed 27% regardless of the 
value of the cost-effectiveness threshold. This result remained robust to 
several sensitivity and subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSION: This trial-based economic evaluation suggests that NPWT is unlikely 
to be a cost-effective strategy for improving outcomes in adult patients with 
severe open fractures of the lower limb. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

Little is known about effective interventions to reduce aggressive end-of-life 
care in patients with cancer. We did a systematic review to assess what 
interventions are associated with reductions in aggressive end-of-life cancer 
care. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and PsychINFO for randomised 
control trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, and observational studies published 
before Jan 19, 2018, which aimed to improve measures of aggressive end-of-life 
care for patients with cancer. We developed a taxonomy of interventions using 
the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to summarise 
existing interventions that addressed aggressive care for patients with cancer. 
Of the 6451 studies identified by our search, five RCTs and 31 observational 
studies met the final inclusion criteria. Using the SEIPS framework, 16 
subcategories of interventions were identified. With the exception of 
documentation of end-of-life discussions in the electronic medical record, no 
single intervention type or SEIPS domain led to consistent improvements in 
aggressive end-of-life care measures. The ability to discern the interventions' 
effectiveness was limited by inconsistent use of validated measures of 
aggressive care. Seven (23%) of 31 observational studies and no RCTs were at low 
risk of bias according to Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. Evidence for improving 
aggressive end-of-life cancer care is limited by the absence of standardised 
measurements and poor study design. Policies and studies to address the gaps 
present in end-of-life care for cancer are necessary.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, severe psychiatric illness with an 
incidence of 3% worldwide. MDD patients have a significantly impaired quality of 
life and reduced life expectancy compared to unaffected individuals, the latter 
being largely accounted for by an increased incidence of suicide and 
cardiovascular disorders. The premature mortality observed in MDD has been 
considered a signature of accelerated aging, a hypothesis supported by data 
showing altered functioning and morphology of several brain regions that are 
typically present in the aging population. Telomere shortening is a hallmark of 
cellular aging, and as such several studies explored the involvement of 
disrupted telomere dynamics in MDD, reporting contrasting findings. In the 
current study, we measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in a sample of 54 MDD 
patients and 47 non-psychiatric controls characterized for response to 
antidepressant treatment. After correcting for age, sex, and body mass index, we 
showed significantly reduced LTL in affected individuals compared to controls 
(beta = -.22, p = .02). There was no difference in LTL between treatment 
resistant or responsive MDD patients. Moreover, we observed no correlation 
between lifetime exposure to antidepressants and LTL. Our study showed that MDD 
patients have shorter telomeres compared to controls, supporting the hypothesis 
of accelerated aging in this disorder. However, LTL seemed not to be influenced 
by antidepressant treatment or to correlate with clinical response to these 
antidepressants. Further investigations in larger samples and possibly with 
longitudinal design are warranted to elucidate the role of altered telomere 
dynamics in MDD.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of six months strength 
training with or without supplementing protein and vitamins, on chromosomal 
integrity of buccal cells in institutionalized elderly. One hundred seventeen 
women and men (65-98 years) performed either resistance training (RT), RT 
combined with a nutritional supplement (RTS) or cognitive training (CT) twice 
per week for six months. Participants' fitness was measured using the 6 min 
walking, the chair rise, and the handgrip strength test. Genotoxicity and 
cytotoxicity parameters were investigated with the Buccal Micronucleus Cytome 
(BMcyt) assay. Six minutes walking and chair rise performance improved 
significantly, however, no changes of the parameters of the BMcyt were detected. 
Age and micronuclei (MN) frequency correlated significantly, for both women 
(r = 0.597, p = 0.000) and men (r = 0.508, p = 0.000). Squared regressions 
revealed a significant increase in the MN frequency of buccal cells with age 
(R2 = 0.466, p = 0.000). Interestingly and contrary to what was shown in blood 
lymphocytes, chromosomal damage in buccal cells increases until very old age, 
which might qualify them as a valid biomarker for aging. Unexpectedly, in this 
group of institutionalized elderly, resistance training using elastic bands had 
no effect on chromosomal damage in buccal cells.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for preventing HIV 
infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), but its cost-effectiveness has 
varied across settings. Using an agent-based model, we projected the 
cost-effectiveness of a statewide PrEP program for MSM in Rhode Island over the 
next decade. In the absence of PrEP, the model predicted an average of 830 new 
HIV infections over ten years. Scaling up the existing PrEP program to cover 15% 
of MSM with ten or more partners each year could reduce the number of new HIV 
infections by 33.1% at a cost of $184,234 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained. Expanded PrEP use among MSM at high risk for HIV infection has the 
potential to prevent a large number of new HIV infections but the high 
drug-related costs may limit the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the developed 
world. The major factor affecting long term survival (other than age) is known 
to be the severity of disability. Yet to our knowledge there are no studies 
reporting life expectancies stratified by both age and severity. Remaining life 
expectancy is a key measure of health.
METHODS: We identified 11 long-term follow-up studies of stroke patients that 
reported the multivariate effects of age, sex, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 
grade of disability, and other factors. From these we computed the composite 
effects of these factors on survival, then used these to calculate age-, sex-, 
and mRS-specific mortality rates. Finally we used the rates to construct life 
tables, and hence obtain life expectancies.
RESULTS: Life expectancy varies by age, sex, and mRS. The life expectancies of 
males age 70, for example, were 13, 13, 11, 8, 6, and 5 years for Rankin Grades 
0-5, respectively, representing reductions of 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 years from 
the corresponding general population figure.
CONCLUSIONS: These figures demonstrate the importance of rehabilitation 
following stroke, and can be used in discussion of public policy and 
benchmarking of future results.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, persons ≥11 years are recommended to receive 
one dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis 
(Tdap) vaccine, followed by decennial tetanus- and diphtheria-toxoid (Td) 
boosters. Many providers use Tdap instead of Td. We evaluated epidemiologic and 
economic impacts of replacing Td boosters with Tdap.
METHODS: We used a static cohort model to examine replacing Td with Tdap over 
the lifetime of 4,386,854 adults ≥21 years. Because pertussis is underdiagnosed 
and true incidence is unknown, we varied incidence from 2.5 cases/100,000 
person-years to 500 cases/100,000 person-years. We calculated vaccine and 
medical costs from claims data. We estimated cost per case prevented and per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved; sensitivity analyses were conducted on 
vaccine effectiveness (VE), protection duration, vaccine cost, disease duration, 
hospitalization rates, productivity loss and missed work. We did not include 
programmatic advantages resulting from use of a single tetanus-toxoid containing 
vaccine.
RESULTS: At lowest incidence estimates, administering Tdap resulted in high 
costs per averted case ($111,540) and QALY saved ($8,972,848). As incidence 
increased, cases averted increased and cost per QALY saved decreased rapidly. 
With incidence estimates of 250 cases/100,000 person-years, cost per averted 
case and QALY saved were $984 and $81,678 respectively; at 500 cases/100,000 
person-years, these values were $427 and $35,474. In multivariate sensitivity 
analyses, assuming 250 cases/100,000 person-years, estimated cost per QALY saved 
ranged from $971 (most favorable) to $217,370 (least favorable).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that replacing Td with Tdap for the decennial 
booster would result in high cost per QALY saved based on reported cases. 
However, programmatic considerations were not accounted for, and if pertussis 
incidence, which is incompletely measured, is assumed to be higher than reported 
through national surveillance, substituting Tdap for Td may lead to moderate 
decreases in pertussis cases and cost per QALY.

BACKGROUND: Surgery of GBM nowadays is usually performed under general 
anesthesia (GA) and resections are often not as aggressive as possible, due to 
the chance of seriously damaging the patient with a rather low life expectancy. 
A surgical technique optimizing resection of the tumor in eloquent areas but 
preventing neurological deficits is necessary to improve survival and quality of 
life in these patients. Awake craniotomy (AC) with the use of cortical and 
subcortical stimulation has been widely implemented for low-grade glioma 
resections (LGG), but not yet for GBM. AC has shown to increase resection 
percentage and preserve quality of life in LGG and could thus be of important 
value in GBM surgery.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled 
trial (RCT). Consecutive patients with a glioblastoma in or near eloquent areas 
(Sawaya grading II/III) will be 1:1 randomized to awake craniotomy or craniotomy 
under general anesthesia. 246 patients will be included in neurosurgical centers 
in the Netherlands and Belgium. Primary end-points are: 1) Postoperative 
neurological morbidity and 2) Proportion of patients with gross-total 
resections. Secondary end-points are: 1) Health-related quality of life; 2) 
Progression-free survival (PFS); 3) Overall survival (OS) and 4) Frequency and 
severity of Serious Adverse Effects in each group. Also, a cost-benefit analysis 
will be performed. All patients will receive standard adjuvant treatment with 
concomitant chemoradiotherapy.
DISCUSSION: This RCT should demonstrate whether AC is superior to craniotomy 
under GA on neurological morbidity, extent of resection and survival for 
glioblastoma resections in or near eloquent areas.

OBJECTIVE: Gains in life expectancy have faltered in several high-income 
countries in recent years. Scotland has consistently had a lower life expectancy 
than many other high-income countries over the past 70 years. We aim to compare 
life expectancy trends in Scotland to those seen internationally and to assess 
the timing and importance of any recent changes in mortality trends for 
Scotland.
SETTING: Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, 
France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland and USA.
METHODS: We used life expectancy data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) to 
calculate the mean annual life expectancy change for 24 high-income countries 
over 5-year periods from 1992 to 2016. Linear regression was used to assess the 
association between life expectancy in 2011 and mean life expectancy change over 
the subsequent 5 years. One-break and two-break segmented regression models were 
used to test the timing of mortality rate changes in Scotland between 1990 and 
2018.
RESULTS: Mean improvements in life expectancy in 2012-2016 were smallest among 
women (<2 weeks/year) in Northern Ireland, Iceland, England and Wales, and the 
USA and among men (<5 weeks/year) in Iceland, USA, England and Wales, and 
Scotland. Japan, Korea and countries of Eastern Europe had substantial gains in 
life expectancy over the same period. The best estimate of when mortality rates 
changed to a slower rate of improvement in Scotland was the year to 2012 quarter 
4 for men and the year to 2014 quarter 2 for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy improvement has stalled across many, but not all, 
high-income countries. The recent change in the mortality trend in Scotland 
occurred within the period 2012-2014. Further research is required to understand 
these trends, but governments must also take timely action on plausible 
contributors.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies on spatial inequalities in mortality in Russia were 
restricted to the highest level of administrative division, ignoring variations 
within the regions. Using mortality data for 2239 districts, this study is the 
first analysis to capture the scale of the mortality divide at a more detailed 
level.
METHODS: Age-standardised death rates are calculated using aggregated deaths for 
2008-2012 and population exposures from the 2010 census. Inequality indices and 
decomposition are applied to quantify both the total mortality disparities 
across the districts and the contributions of the variations between and within 
regions.
RESULTS: Regional variations in mortality mask one-third (males) and one-half 
(females) of the inequalities observed at the district level. A comparison of 
the 5% of individuals residing in the districts with the highest and the lowest 
mortality shows a gap of 15.5 years for males and 10.3 years for females. The 
lowest life expectancy levels are in the shrinking areas of the Far East and 
Northwest of Russia. The highest life expectancy clusters are in the intercity 
districts of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and in several science cities. Life 
expectancy in these best-practice districts is close to the national averages of 
Poland and Estonia, but is still substantially below the averages in Western 
countries.
CONCLUSION: The large between-regional and within-regional disparities suggest 
that national-level mortality could be lowered if these disparities are reduced 
by improving health in the laggard areas. This can be achieved by introducing 
policies that promote health convergence both within and between the Russian 
regions.
