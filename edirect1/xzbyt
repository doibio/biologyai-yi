PURPOSE: The direct impact of protracted conflict on population health and 
development is well understood. However, the extent of a war's impact on 
long-term health, and the opportunity costs, are less well understood. This 
research sought to overcome this gap by asking whether or not health outcomes in 
Sri Lanka would have been better in the absence of a 26-year war than they were 
in the presence of war.
METHODS: A counterfactual model of national and district-level health outcomes 
was created for Sri Lanka for the period 1982 to 2002. At the national level, 
the model examined life expectancy, infant mortality rate (IMR), and maternal 
mortality ratios (MMR). At the district level, it looked at IMR and MMR. The 
model compared outcomes generated by the counterfactual model to actual obtained 
health outcomes. It looked at the rate of change and absolute values.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that war altered both rate of change and 
absolute health outcomes for the worse. The impact was most clearly evident at 
the district level. IMR was poorer than predicted in 10 districts; of these 8 
were outside of the conflict zone. The MMR was worse than expected in 11 
districts of which 9 were not in the conflict zone. Additionally, the rate of 
improvement in IMR slowed as a result of war in 16 districts whereas the rate of 
improvement in MMR slowed in 9.
CONCLUSION: This project showed that protracted conflict degraded the trajectory 
of public health in Sri Lanka and hurt population health outside of the conflict 
zone. It further provided a novel methodology with which to better understand 
the indirect impact of conflict on population health by comparing what is to 
what could have been achieved in the absence of war. In so doing, this research 
responded to two public health challenges by providing a tool through which to 
better understand the human and opportunity costs of war and by answering a call 
for new methodologies.

The introduction of Proprotein covertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
inhibitors has been heralded as a major advancement in reducing low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels by nearly 50%. However, concerns have been raised 
on the added value to the health care system in terms of their costs and 
benefits. We assess the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors based on a 
decision-analytic model with existing clinical evidence. The model compares a 
lipid-lowering therapy based on statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor treatment with 
statin treatment only (standard therapy). From health system perspective, 
incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained are presented. 
From a private payer perspective, return-on-investment and net present values 
over patient lifespan are presented. At the current annual cost of $14,000 to 
$15,000, PCSK9 inhibitors are not cost-effective at an incremental cost of about 
$350,000 per QALY. Moreover, for every dollar invested in PCSK9 inhibitors, the 
private payer loses $1.98. Our study suggests that the annual treatment price 
should be set at $4,250 at a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY. 
However, we estimate the breakeven price for private payer is only $600 per 
annual treatment. At current prices, our study suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors do 
not add value to the U.S. health system and their provision is not profitable 
for private payers. To be the breakthrough drug in the fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the current price of PCSK9 inhibitors must be reduced by 
more than 70%.

Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects in special situations: 
hidradenitis suppurativa in paediatric patients.

Hidradenitis suppurativa usually develops in the third decade of life and is 
infrequent in children and adolescents. This article reviews the scant 
epidemiological clinical and therapeutic data that are available for this age 
group. From the epidemiological point of view, reports have been more numerous 
in children, which has been related to hormone alterations and with a possibly 
higher genetic load than when this disease develops in adults. Clinically, it 
seems that when hidradenitis suppurativa develops in young patients, there is 
greater disease extension. The therapeutic approach is especially complex, since 
there is hardly any scientific evidence to serve as a basis for decisions. The 
challenges posed by this disease are to help patients accept their disease, 
recommend them healthy lifestyle habits and choose the most appropriate 
treatment for each patient.

OBJECTIVE: To show laparoscopic surgery to treat vaginal shortening, with 
functional sequelae (sexual disorders), after radiotherapy and brachytherapy for 
vaginal carcinoma.
METHODS: Davydov's procedure was initially described to treat vaginal aplasia 
(Davydov & Zhvitiashvili, 1974). This surgery was then improved for the upper 
part of the vagina, performed by laparoscopy (Leblanc, 2010; Adamyan, 1995) 
[2-3]. We used surgical technique, based on Davydov's procedure, by laparoscopy, 
to cover the upper neovagina, with two large peritoneal flaps, one anterior with 
the pre-vesical peritoneum and a second one posterior with the peritoneum of 
Douglas pouch. This surgery can be performed with no use of intestinal gesture, 
skin grafting, flap or any foreign material. Leblanc et al. (2016) [4] reported 
promising results about eight patients with this technique.
RESULTS: A 36-years old patient had been treated by chemotherapy, radiotherapy 
and brachytherapy for a vagina cancer with a para-rectal extension. After four 
years of remission, she was worried about an important vaginal atrophy related 
to a significant vaginal shortening (about 5cm), causing major dyspareunia. This 
situation had caused sexual disorders with a real impact on the quality of life. 
All non-invasive techniques (dilatators, lubricants…) had led to failures. A 
colpoplasty by laparoscopic modified Davydov's procedure was performed. The 
post-operative follow-up was simple without complication. The vaginal mandrel 
was removed after 12days. The clinical examination after 4months demonstrates 
that size and elasticity of the neovaginal cavity was rewarding.
CONCLUSION: This surgical technique requires training and experienced team, but 
seems to be promising way to restore a normal vaginal length.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT angiography and perfusion imaging is an important 
prognostic tool in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of 
radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts 
were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the 
cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial 
Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer 
Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on 
literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected 
quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, 
resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when 
incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 
2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, 
with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit 
or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for 
scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of 
selected input parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important 
consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred 
imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and 
symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health 
care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency 
period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an auto-immune disease characterized by the selective 
destruction of the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas during an 
inflammatory phase known as insulitis. Patients with T1D are typically dependent 
on the administration of externally provided insulin in order to manage blood 
glucose levels. Whilst technological developments have significantly improved 
both the life expectancy and quality of life of these patients, an understanding 
of the mechanisms of the disease remains elusive. Animal models, such as the NOD 
mouse model, have been widely used to probe the process of insulitis, but there 
exist very few data from humans studied at disease onset. In this manuscript, we 
employ data from human pancreases collected close to the onset of T1D and 
propose a spatio-temporal computational model for the progression of insulitis 
in human T1D, with particular focus on the mechanisms underlying the development 
of insulitis in pancreatic islets. This framework allows us to investigate how 
the time-course of insulitis progression is affected by altering key parameters, 
such as the number of the CD20+ B cells present in the inflammatory infiltrate, 
which has recently been proposed to influence the aggressiveness of the disease. 
Through the analysis of repeated simulations of our stochastic model, which 
track the number of beta cells within an islet, we find that increased numbers 
of B cells in the peri-islet space lead to faster destruction of the beta cells. 
We also find that the balance between the degradation and repair of the basement 
membrane surrounding the islet is a critical component in governing the overall 
destruction rate of the beta cells and their remaining number. Our model 
provides a framework for continued and improved spatio-temporal modeling of 
human T1D.

Require Individuals to Obtain Coverage.

DeCristofaro AH.

This article explores how requiring individuals to obtain health insurance (an 
individual mandate) would affect health system performance along nine 
dimensions. An individual mandate would increase the number of people with 
coverage by 9 to 34 million, depending on the policy's design. Newly insured 
individuals would have improved patient experience and increased life 
expectancy. There is little evidence about how an individual mandate would 
affect waste; it would have no effect on spending, consumer financial risk, the 
reliability of receiving recommended care, or system capacity. Implementing an 
individual mandate would be challenging because it is difficult to determine 
compliance and enforce penalties for noncompliance.

Require Employers to Offer Coverage.

DeCristofaro AH.

This article explores how requiring employers to offer health insurance (an 
employer mandate) would affect health system performance along nine dimensions. 
An employer mandate would increase the number of people with coverage by 1.8 to 
3.4 million; the newly insured would have better health, as measured by life 
expectancy. No studies directly analyze how an employer mandate would affect 
patient experience; it would have no effect on spending, consumer financial 
risk, waste, the reliability of receiving recommended care, or system capacity. 
An employer mandate would be moderately challenging to implement primarily 
because of the need to monitor and enforce compliance.

Modify Federal Tax Code to Create Incentives for Individuals to Obtain Coverage.

McGlynn EA.

This article explores how a refundable tax credit to offset the cost of health 
insurance premiums would affect health system performance along nine dimensions. 
A refundable tax credit would produce a slight gain in health as measured by 
life expectancy; 2.3 to 10 million people would become newly insured under this 
policy change. It is uncertain how the policy would affect waste or patient 
experience. Refundable tax credits would have no discernable effect on total 
health care spending, overall consumer financial risk, reliability of care, or 
health system capacity. Implementing refundable tax credits would be relatively 
easy.

Ease Medicaid/SCHIP Eligibility Rules.

Effros R.

This article explores how expanding Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance 
Program (SCHIP) eligibility would affect health system performance along nine 
dimensions. Expansion would substantially reduce consumer financial risk for 
those newly insured and would increase coverage by 6 to 26 percent. Expanded 
coverage should improve the health of some groups, as measured by life 
expectancy. The effect of Medicaid/SCHIP expansion on waste or patient 
experience is uncertain. Expansion would have no discernible effect on overall 
health care spending but would increase government spending. Expansion is 
unlikely to affect the reliability of care or health system capacity. Expanding 
Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility would be relatively simple because the administrative 
infrastructure already exists.

Cataract Blindness and Simulation-Based Training for Cataract Surgeons: An 
Assessment of the HelpMeSee Approach.

Broyles JR, Glick P, Hu J, Lim YW.

Cataracts account for about half of all cases of blindness worldwide, with the 
vast majority in developing countries, where blindness and visual impairment can 
reduce life expectancy and economic productivity. Most of these cases can be 
cured by quick, inexpensive surgical procedures, but a shortage of trained 
surgeons makes it unlikely that the need for such surgeries-estimated to reach 
32 million cases globally by 2020-can be met under current practices. HelpMeSee 
Inc. (HMS) is developing an approach to surgery training and delivery that 
includes use of high-fidelity simulator technology and associated curricula for 
high-volume training, development of a system of independent private 
practitioners, and training where necessary of individuals without medical 
degrees. RAND researchers determined that the program has the potential to scale 
up surgical capacity rapidly and that under optimistic assumptions, the HMS 
program could largely close the backlog of surgical cases in the four major 
regions studied, resulting in 21 million cases of cataract-caused visual 
impairment in 2030, compared with 134 million cases under the status quo. The 
program also promises to have large impacts on health and productivity, and the 
estimated costs per year of disability averted suggest that the intervention 
would be highly cost-effective in each of the regions researched. However, a 
number of significant challenges need to be met, particularly in the areas of 
outreach, remote monitoring of independent practitioners (especially 
non-doctors), and public and legal acceptance of non-doctors as surgeons. It is 
important to carefully pilot and monitor the approach before fully scaling up.

Co-expression networks based on transcriptomes of Populus trichocarpa major 
tissues and specific cell types suggest redundant control of cell wall component 
biosynthetic genes by transcription factors in wood formation. We analyzed the 
transcriptomes of five tissues (xylem, phloem, shoot, leaf, and root) and two 
wood forming cell types (fiber and vessel) of Populus trichocarpa to assemble 
gene co-expression subnetworks associated with wood formation. We identified 165 
transcription factors (TFs) that showed xylem-, fiber-, and vessel-specific 
expression. Of these 165 TFs, 101 co-expressed (correlation coefficient, 
r > 0.7) with the 45 secondary cell wall cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin 
biosynthetic genes. Each cell wall component gene co-expressed on average with 
34 TFs, suggesting redundant control of the cell wall component gene expression. 
Co-expression analysis showed that the 101 TFs and the 45 cell wall component 
genes each has two distinct groups (groups 1 and 2), based on their 
co-expression patterns. The group 1 TFs (44 members) are predominantly xylem and 
fiber specific, and are all highly positively co-expressed with the group 1 cell 
wall component genes (30 members), suggesting their roles as major wood 
formation regulators. Group 1 TFs include a lateral organ boundary domain gene 
(LBD) that has the highest number of positively correlated cell wall component 
genes (36) and TFs (47). The group 2 TFs have 57 members, including 14 
vessel-specific TFs, and are generally less correlated with the cell wall 
component genes. An exception is a vessel-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 
gene that negatively correlates with 20 cell wall component genes, and may 
function as a key transcriptional suppressor. The co-expression networks 
revealed here suggest a well-structured transcriptional homeostasis for cell 
wall component biosynthesis during wood formation.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, more elderly patients with end-stage 
hip arthritis are electing to undergo primary THA. Octogenarians undergoing THA 
have more comorbidities than younger patients, but this is not reflected in risk 
adjustment models for bundled care programs. The burden of care associated with 
THA in octogenarians has not been well characterized, and doing so may help 
these value-based programs make adjustments so that this vulnerable patient 
population does not risk losing access under accountable care models.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to describe care use, 
comorbidities, and complications among octogenarians undergoing primary THA.
METHODS: Five percent of the Medicare national administrative claims data was 
queried to identify patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis between January 
1, 1998, and December 31, 2013. Patients who underwent primary THA were 
identified and followed longitudinally during the study period using their 
unique, encrypted Medicare beneficiary identifiers. We compared risk factors and 
complications between the octogenarian group versus those aged 65 to 69 years. 
Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient/hospital 
factors on risk of revision, periprosthetic joint infection, dislocation, venous 
thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Patient factors in the model included age, 
sex, race, region, socioeconomic status, and health status based on Charlson 
comorbidity score 12 months before replacement surgery.
RESULTS: There were 11,960 THAs in the octogenarians in 1998, which increased to 
21,620 in 2013, an 81% increase during this study period. Octogenarians were 
more likely to have a Charlson score of 3 or higher than those patients aged 65 
to 69 years (30% versus 17%, odds ratio [OR] 2.07 [1.98-2.20]; p < 0.001), and 
they were more likely to have coronary artery disease or congestive heart 
failure (47% versus 29%, OR 2.16 [2.06-2.26]; p < 0.001). The octogenarian group 
had a greater risk of dislocation (+12%, p = 0.01), VTE (+14%, p < 0.001), and 
mortality (+150%, p < 0.001) compared with the younger age cohort. A total of 
21% of the octogenarians were readmitted after surgery compared with 12% for 
patients in the younger group (OR=1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.54-1.75; p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Because octogenarians are at increased risk of dislocation, VTE, 
medical complications, and mortality after THA, value-based care models that 
penalize hospitals for readmissions and complications may inadvertently result 
in loss of access to care for this group of patients as a result of the 
financial makeup of these bundled care models. Value-based care models were 
developed to improve care and decrease healthcare costs but may have unintended 
consequences in the octogenarian with higher complication and readmission risks. 
Financial losses may lead to institutions from withdrawing from the Bundled 
Payments for Care Improvement program. To try to prevent this from happening to 
this vulnerable patient population, bundled care programs should evolve and be 
modified to allow for risk stratification in the overall payment formula to 
account for increased age and comorbid conditions to ensure continued successful 
participation in the program among all the stakeholders.

Anti-angiogenic therapy has become an important component in the treatment of 
many solid tumors given the importance of adequate blood supply for tumor growth 
and metastasis. Despite promising preclinical data and early clinical trials, 
anti-angiogenic agents have failed to show a survival benefit in randomized 
controlled trials of patients with glioblastoma. In particular, agents targeting 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appear to prolong progression free 
survival, possibly improve quality of life, and decrease steroid usage, yet the 
trials to date have demonstrated no extension of overall survival. In order to 
improve duration of response and convey a survival benefit, additional research 
is still needed to explore alternative pro-angiogenic pathways, mechanisms of 
resistance, combination strategies, and biomarkers to predict therapeutic 
response.

OBJECTIVE: Reports from cancer registries often lack clinically relevant 
information, which would be useful in estimating the prognosis of individual 
patients with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCB). This article 
presents estimates of crude probabilities of death due to UCB and the expected 
loss of lifetime stratified for patient characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Norway, 10,332 patients were diagnosed with UCB 
between 2001 and 2010. The crude probabilities of death due to UCB were 
estimated, stratified by gender, age and T stage, using flexible parametric 
survival models. Based on these models, the loss in expectation of lifetime due 
to UCB was also estimated for the different strata.
RESULTS: There is large variation in the estimated crude probabilities of death 
due to UCB (from 0.03 to 0.76 within 10 years since diagnosis) depending on age, 
gender and T stage. Furthermore, the expected loss of life expectancy is more 
than a decade for younger patients with muscle-invasive UCB and between a few 
months and 5 years for nonmuscle-invasive UCB.
CONCLUSIONS: The suggested framework leads to clinically relevant prognostic 
risk estimates for individual patients diagnosed with UCB and the consequence in 
terms of loss of lifetime expectation. The published probability tables can be 
used in clinical praxis for risk communication.

Life expectancy in most countries has been increasing continually over the 
several few decades thanks to significant improvements in medicine, public 
health, as well as personal and environmental hygiene. However, increased life 
expectancy combined with falling birth rates are expected to engender a large 
aging demographic in the near future that would impose significant  burdens on 
the socio-economic structure of these countries. Therefore, it is essential to 
develop cost-effective, easy-to-use systems for the sake of elderly healthcare 
and well-being. Remote health monitoring, based on non-invasive and wearable 
sensors, actuators and modern communication and information technologies offers 
an efficient and cost-effective solution that allows the elderly to continue to 
live in their comfortable home environment instead of expensive healthcare 
facilities. These systems will also allow healthcare personnel to monitor 
important physiological signs of their patients in real time, assess health 
conditions and provide feedback from distant facilities. In this paper, we have 
presented and compared several low-cost and non-invasive health and activity 
monitoring systems that were reported in recent years. A survey on textile-based 
sensors that can potentially be used in wearable systems is also presented. 
Finally, compatibility of several communication technologies as well as future 
perspectives and research challenges in remote monitoring systems will be 
discussed.

Human evolution and lifestyle changes caused by the agricultural and industrial 
revolutions have led to great advances in medicine and increased life 
expectancy, whilst also profoundly altering the ecological relationships and 
disease patterns of populations. Studies involving populations that still enjoy 
a rural way of life and with traits similar to the Paleolithic period reveal 
them to present a more robust, resistant and diverse gut microbiota, in 
comparison to highly industrialized civilizations. The human diet has expanded 
and broadened to include the consumption of high-calorie foods, particularly 
from animal sources such as game meat and eggs. For some time, authors have been 
alert to the fact that a modern lifestyle leads to reduced intake of beneficial 
bacteria, suggesting that nonpathogenic bacteria are being eradicated. 
Furthermore, therapeutic procedures, including the use of probiotics and 
prebiotics, have been proposed to lead to recovery of this microbiota, which is 
altered due to both the ageing process and lifestyle related aspects. 
Accordingly, this article aims to review the impact of human aging and modern 
lifestyle on gut microbiota, within an evolutionary, ecological, epidemiological 
and therapeutic context.

The present study aims to investigate the influence of human activity on heavy 
metals in a typical arid urban area of China and assess human health risks posed 
by heavy metals in PM1 (particles <1.0 μm in diameter) for different people. In 
this paper, Changji (Xinjiang, China) was selected as the study area, and 
samples were collected from March 2014 to March 2015. A total 14 elements in PM1 
were quantified using ICP-MS. An enrichment factor (EF) was used to assess the 
influence of human activity on the contamination of these metals. The results 
indicated that Mn was not enriched; Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Tl, and V were slightly 
enriched; Mo, Pb, and Sb were moderately enriched; and Ag, As, and Cd were 
strongly enriched. To assess the health risks associated with inhaling PM1, the 
risk assessment code and loss in life expectancy based on the individual metals 
were calculated. The results showed that the elements Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Tl, 
and V in PM1 posed low levels of non-carcinogenic risks, but these metals may 
still pose risks to certain susceptible populations. In addition, the results 
also showed that As, Co, and Cr posed an appreciable carcinogenic risk, while Cd 
and Ni posed low levels of carcinogenic risk. The total predicted loss of life 
expectancy caused by the three metals As, Co, and Ni was 63.67 d for the 
elderly, 30.95 d for adult males, 26.62 d for adult females, and 48.22 d for 
children. Therefore, the safety of the elderly and children exposed to PM1 
should be given more attention than the safety of adults. The results from this 
study demonstrate that the health risks posed by heavy metals in PM1 in Changji, 
Xinjiang, China should be examined.

BACKGROUND: Primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in older people is 
challenging as they are a diverse group with varying needs, frequent presence of 
comorbidities, and are more susceptible to treatment harms. Moreover the 
potential benefits and harms of preventive medication for older people are 
uncertain. We explored GPs' decision making about primary CVD prevention in 
patients aged 75 years and older.
METHOD: 25 GPs participated in semi-structured interviews in New South Wales, 
Australia. Transcribed audio-recordings were thematically coded and Framework 
Analysis was used.
RESULTS: Analysis identified factors that are likely to contribute to variation 
in the management of CVD risk in older people. Some GPs based CVD prevention on 
guidelines regardless of patient age. Others tailored management based on 
factors such as perceptions of prevention in older age, knowledge of limited 
evidence, comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty, and life expectancy. GPs were 
more confident about: 1) medication and lifestyle change for fit/healthy older 
patients, and 2) stopping or avoiding medication for frail/nursing home 
patients. Decision making for older patients outside of these categories was 
less clear.
CONCLUSION: Older patients receive different care depending on their GP's 
perceptions of ageing and CVD prevention, and their knowledge of available 
evidence. GPs consider CVD prevention for older patients challenging and would 
welcome more guidance in this area.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) costs the English economy an estimated 
£5.2billion/year, largely through incomplete recovery. This analysis estimated 
the cost-effectiveness of group psychoeducation (PEd), versus group peer support 
(PS), for treating BD.
METHODS: A 96-week pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), conducted in NHS 
primary care. The primary analysis compared PEd with PS, using multiple imputed 
datasets for missing values. An economic model was used to compare PEd with 
treatment as usual (TAU). The perspective was Health and Personal Social 
Services.
RESULTS: Participants receiving PEd (n=153) used more (costly) health-related 
resources than PS (n=151) (net cost per person £1098 (95% CI, £252-£1943)), with 
a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.023 (95% CI, 0.001-0.056). The 
cost per QALY gained was £47,739. PEd may be cost-effective (versus PS) if 
decision makers are willing to pay at least £37,500 per QALY gained. PEd costs 
£10,765 more than PS to avoid one relapse. The economic model indicates that PEd 
may be cost-effective versus TAU if it reduces the probability of relapse (by 
15%) or reduces the probability of and increases time to relapse (by 10%).
LIMITATIONS: Participants were generally inconsistent in attending treatment 
sessions and low numbers had complete cost/QALY data. Factors contributing to 
pervasive uncertainty of the results are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation of PEd versus PS in a 
pragmatic trial. PEd is associated with a modest improvement in health status 
and higher costs than PS. There is a high level of uncertainty in the data and 
results.

Aging is a complex phenomenon and its impact is becoming more relevant due to 
the rising life expectancy and because aging itself is the basis for the 
development of age-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases 
and type 2 diabetes. Recent years of scientific research have brought up 
different theories that attempt to explain the aging process. So far, there is 
no single theory that fully explains all facets of aging. The damage 
accumulation theory is one of the most accepted theories due to the large body 
of evidence found over the years. Damage accumulation is thought to be driven, 
among others, by oxidative stress. This condition results in an excess attack of 
oxidants on biomolecules, which lead to damage accumulation over time and 
contribute to the functional involution of cells, tissues and organisms. If 
oxidative stress persists, cellular senescence is a likely outcome and an 
important hallmark of aging. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand how 
senescent cells function and how they contribute to the aging process. This 
review will cover cellular senescence features related to the protein pool such 
as morphological and molecular hallmarks, how oxidative stress promotes protein 
modifications, how senescent cells cope with them by proteostasis mechanisms, 
including antioxidant enzymes and proteolytic systems. We will also highlight 
the nutritional status of senescent cells and aged organisms (including human 
clinical studies) by exploring trace elements and micronutrients and on their 
importance to develop strategies that might increase both, life and health span 
and postpone aging onset.

The redox environment in cells and organisms is set by low-molecular mass and 
protein-bound thiols, with glutathione (GSH) representing a major intracellular 
redox buffer. Subtle thiol oxidation elicits signal transduction processes and 
adaptive responses to cope with stressors, whereas highly oxidizing conditions 
may provoke cell death. We here tested how thiol depletion affects life span, 
stress resistance and stress signaling in the model organism Caenorhabditis 
elegans. Diethyl maleate (DEM), an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound that 
conjugates to GSH and other thiols, decreased C. elegans life span at a 
concentration of 1mM. In contrast, low and moderate doses of DEM (10-100µM) 
increased mean and maximum life span and improved resistance against oxidative 
stress. DEM-induced life span extension was not detectable in worms deficient in 
either the FoxO orthologue, DAF-16, or the Nrf2 orthologue, SKN-1, pointing to a 
collaborative role of the two transcription factors in life span extension 
induced by thiol depletion. Cytoprotective target genes of DAF-16 and SKN-1 were 
upregulated after at least 3 days of exposure to 100µM DEM, but not 1mM DEM, 
whereas only 1mM DEM caused upregulation of egl-1, a gene controlled by a 
p53-orthologue, CEP-1. In order to test whether depletion of GSH may elicit 
effects similar to DEM, we suppressed GSH biosynthesis in worms by attenuating 
γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gcs-1) expression through RNAi. The decline in 
GSH levels elicited by gcs-1 knockdown starting at young adult stage did not 
impair viability, but increased both stress resistance and life expectancy of 
the worms. In contrast, gcs-1 knockdown commencing right after hatching impaired 
nematode stress resistance and rendered young adult worms prone to vulval 
ruptures during egg-laying. Thus, modest decrease in GSH levels in young adult 
worms may promote stress resistance and life span, whereas depletion of GSH is 
detrimental to freshly hatched and developing worms.

BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers have become subject of study in recent years due to 
the treatment high costs and decreased life quality from patients. These chronic 
wounds are related to the global life expectancy increment, being the geriatric 
and physical disable patients the principal affected by this condition. Injuries 
diagnosis and treatment usually takes weeks or even months by medical personel. 
Using non-invasive techniques, such as image processing techniques, it is 
possible to conduct an analysis from ulcers and aid in its diagnosis.
METHODS: This paper proposes a novel technique for image segmentation based on 
contrast changes by using synthetic frequencies obtained from the grayscale 
value available in each pixel of the image. These synthetic frequencies are 
calculated using the model of energy density over an electric field to describe 
a relation between a constant density and the image amplitude in a pixel. A 
toroidal geometry is used to decompose the image into different contrast levels 
by variating the synthetic frequencies. Then, the decomposed image is binarized 
applying Otsu's threshold allowing for obtaining the contours that describe the 
contrast variations. Morphological operations are used to obtain the desired 
segment of the image.
RESULTS: The proposed technique is evaluated by synthesizing a Data Base with 51 
images of pressure ulcers, provided by the Centre IGURCO. With the segmentation 
of these pressure ulcer images it is possible to aid in its diagnosis and 
treatment. To provide evidences of technique performance, digital image 
correlation was used as a measure, where the segments obtained using the 
methodology are compared with the real segments. The proposed technique is 
compared with two benchmarked algorithms. The results over the technique present 
an average correlation of 0.89 with a variation of ±0.1 and a computational time 
of 9.04 seconds.
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology presents better segmentation results than the 
benchmarked algorithms using less computational time and without the need of an 
initial condition.
