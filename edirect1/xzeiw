BACKGROUND: The UK Government's 'welfare reform' programme included reductions 
to social security payments, phased in over the financial years 
2011/2012-2015/2016. Previous studies of social security cuts and health 
outcomes have been restricted to analysing single UK countries or single payment 
types (eg, housing benefit). We examined the association between all social 
security cuts fully implemented by 2016 and life expectancy, for local 
authorities in England, Scotland and Wales.
METHODS: Our unit of analysis was 201 upper tier local authorities (unitary 
authorities and county councils: 147 in England, 32 in Scotland, 22 in Wales). 
Our exposure was estimated social security loss per head of the working age 
population per year for each local authority, calculated against the baseline in 
2010/2011. The primary outcome was annual life expectancy at birth between the 
calendar years 2012 and 2016 (year lagged following exposure). We used a panel 
regression approach with fixed effects.
RESULTS: Social security cuts implemented by 2016 were estimated to be £475 per 
head of the working age population in England, £390 in Scotland and £490 in 
Wales since 2010/2011. During the study period, there was either no improvement 
or only marginal increases in national life expectancy. Social security loss and 
life expectancy were significantly associated: an estimated £100 decrease in 
social security per head of working age population was associated with a 1-month 
reduction in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Social security cuts, at the UK local authority level, were 
associated with lower life expectancy. Further research should examine 
causality.

Using a regional population-based dataset in Japan, we identified the 
epidemiological characteristics of patients with fragility fractures of the 
pelvic ring. The incidence rate was 35.5-121.2 per 100,000 population/year. 
Age-specific incidence increased after 75 years. This fracture is associated 
with worse prognosis in terms of walking function and life expectancy.
PURPOSE: Fragility fracture of the pelvic ring (FFP) is common among older 
patients; however, little information is available on the epidemiology of FFP 
worldwide. We aimed to identify the epidemiological characteristics of patients 
with FFP using a regional population-based dataset in Japan.
METHODS: This descriptive epidemiologic study analyzed data obtained from 
clinical information of patients diagnosed with FFP from January 1, 2011 through 
December 31, 2020 at a regional dominant hospital in Japan. We calculated the 
crude and age-adjusted annual incidences and the age-specific incidence and 
described epidemiological date, injury characteristics, walking ability before 
and after FFP, and mortality. Additionally, we investigated factors associated 
with walking ability.
RESULTS: We identified 66 FFP patients, of whom 55 (83.3%) were female, with a 
mean age of 82.2 years. The crude annual incidence of FFP ranged from 35.5-121.2 
per 100,000 population/year during the study period. The age-specific incidence 
of FFP increased after 75 and 80 years in females and males, respectively. In 
total, 44.4% of patients had declines in walking ability 1 year after their FFP 
injuries. Patients with declining walking ability were significantly older 
(p < 0.01), and age ≥ 80 years was significantly associated with the decline in 
walking ability (p < 0.01). The 1- and 5-year mortality rates were 15.4% and 
39.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of FFP was 35.5-121.2 per 100,000 
population/year. Age-specific incidence of FFP increased after 75 years. Our 
results indicate that FFP is associated with worse prognosis of walking function 
and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy and persistently low fertility levels 
have led to old population age structures in most high-income countries, and 
population ageing is expected to continue or even accelerate in the coming 
decades. While older adults on average have few interactions that potentially 
could lead to disease transmission, their morbidity and mortality due to 
infectious diseases, respiratory infections in particular, remain substantial. 
We aim to explore how population ageing affects the future transmission dynamics 
and mortality burden of emerging respiratory infections.
METHODS: Using longitudinal individual-level data from population registers, we 
model the Belgian population with evolving age and household structures, and 
explicitly consider long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Three scenarios are 
presented for the future proportion of older adults living in LTCFs. For each 
demographic scenario, we simulate outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and a novel influenza 
A virus in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 and distinguish between household and 
community transmission. We estimate attack rates by age and household size/type, 
as well as disease-related deaths and the associated quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) lost.
RESULTS: As the population is ageing, small households and LTCFs become more 
prevalent. Additionally, families with children become smaller (i.e. low 
fertility, single-parent families). The overall attack rate slightly decreases 
as the population is ageing, but to a larger degree for influenza than for 
SARS-CoV-2 due to differential age-specific attack rates. Nevertheless, the 
number of deaths and QALY losses per 1,000 people is increasing for both 
infections and at a speed influenced by the share living in LTCFs.
CONCLUSION: Population ageing is associated with smaller outbreaks of COVID-19 
and influenza, but at the same time it is causing a substantially larger burden 
of mortality, even if the proportion of LTCF residents were to decrease. These 
relationships are influenced by age patterns in epidemiological parameters. Not 
only the shift in the age distribution, but also the induced changes in the 
household structures are important to consider when assessing the potential 
impact of population ageing on the transmission and burden of emerging 
respiratory infections.

BACKGROUND: Quality of care at the end of life in hospitals is often perceived 
to be lower compared to the care that is provided to people who die in their own 
home. Documenting and measuring indicators of common end-of-life symptoms could 
help improve end-of-life care in hospitals. This study provided insight into 
quality indicators for the end-of-life care of patients who died in a Dutch 
hospital, and assessed differences between deceased patients who were admitted 
for palliative/terminal care versus patients admitted for other reasons.
METHODS: In a retrospective record review study, trained nurses reviewed 
electronic health records (EHRs) of patients who died in 2019 (n = 2998), in a 
stratified sample of 20 Dutch hospitals. The nurses registered whether data was 
found in de EHRs about quality indicators for end-of-life care. This concerned: 
symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, anxiety, depressive symptoms), spiritual 
and psychological support and advance care planning. Multilevel regression 
analyses were performed to assess differences between patients who had been 
admitted for palliative/terminal care and patients admitted for other reasons.
RESULTS: Common end-of-life symptoms were rarely measured using a standardized 
method (e.g. Numeric Rating Scale, Visual Analogue Scale or Utrecht Symptom 
Diary). The symptom burden of pain was measured using a standardized method more 
often (63.3%) than the symptom burden of shortness of breath (2.2%), anxiety 
(0.5%) and depressive symptoms (0.3%). Similarly, little information was 
documented in the EHRs regarding wish to involve a spiritual counsellor, 
psychologist or social worker. Life expectancy was documented in 66%. The 
preferred place of death was documented less often (20%). The documentation of 
some quality indicators differed between patients who were admitted for 
palliative/terminal care compared to other patients.
CONCLUSION: Except for the burden of pain, symptoms are rarely measured with 
standardized methods in patients who died in Dutch Hospitals. This study 
underlines the importance of documenting information about symptom burden and 
aspects related to advance care planning, and spiritual and psychological 
support to improve the quality of end-of-life care for patients in hospitals. 
Furthermore, uniformity in measuring methods improves the possibility to compare 
results between patient groups and settings.

BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically extended 
the life expectancy of people living with HIV-1 and improved their quality of 
life. There is nevertheless no cure for HIV-1 infection since HIV-1 persists in 
viral reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells. cART does not eradicate 
HIV-1 reservoirs or restore cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells which are 
dramatically reduced by HIV-1 infection, and express the checkpoint inhibitors 
NKG2A or KIR2DL upregulated after HIV-1 infection. Cytotoxic NK cells expressing 
the homing receptor CXCR5 were recently described as key subsets controlling 
viral replication.
METHODS: We designed and evaluated the potency of "Natural killer activating 
Multimeric immunotherapeutic compleXes", called as NaMiX, combining multimers of 
the IL-15/IL-15Rα complex with an anti-NKG2A or an anti-KIR single-chain 
fragment variable (scFv) to kill HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells. The 
oligomerization domain of the C4 binding protein was used to associate the 
IL-15/IL-15Rα complex to the scFv of each checkpoint inhibitor as well as to 
multimerize each entity into a heptamer (α form) or a dimer (β form). Each α or 
β form was compared in different in vitro models using one-way ANOVA and 
post-hoc Tukey's tests before evaluation in humanized NSG tg-huIL-15 mice having 
functional NK cells.
RESULTS: All NaMiX significantly enhanced the cytolytic activity of NK and CD8+ 
T cells against Raji tumour cells and HIV-1+ ACH-2 cells by increasing 
degranulation, release of granzyme B, perforin and IFN-γ. Targeting NKG2A had a 
stronger effect than targeting KIR2DL due to higher expression of NKG2A on NK 
cells. In viral inhibition assays, NaMiX initially increased viral replication 
of CD4+ T cells which was subsequently inhibited by cytotoxic NK cells. 
Importantly, anti-NKG2A NaMiX enhanced activation, cytotoxicity, IFN-γ 
production and CXCR5 expression of NK cells from HIV-1 positive individuals. In 
humanized NSG tg-huIL-15 mice, we confirmed enhanced activation, degranulation, 
cytotoxicity of NK cells, and killing of HIV-1 infected cells from mice injected 
with the anti-NKG2A.α NaMiX, as compared to control mice, as well as decreased 
total HIV-1 DNA in the lung.
CONCLUSIONS: NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-1 infected cells by NaMiX 
represents a promising approach to support HIV-1 cure strategies.

BACKGROUND: There is still a profound lack of efficient therapeutic strategies 
against pancreatic and other periampullary adenocarcinoma. Surgery is seldom 
possible, leaving palliative chemotherapy the only option for most patients. 
Chemotherapy treatment is however often accompanied by serious side-effects, and 
the identification of biomarkers for early prediction of disease and 
treatment-associated symptoms could help alleviate patient suffering. This study 
investigated the dynamic interrelationship between immune-related serum 
proteins, routine biomarkers, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) factors 
during chemotherapy treatment of patients enrolled in the prospective, 
observational study Chemotherapy, Host response And Molecular dynamics in 
Periampullary cancer (CHAMP).
METHODS: Proximity extension assay was applied to analyse 92 immune-associated 
proteins in longitudinal serum samples from 75 patients, 18 treated with 
curative and 57 with palliative intent. HRQoL data were available from all 
patients at baseline (BL), from 41 patients at three months, and from 23 
patients at six months. Information on routine laboratory parameters albumin, 
CA19-9, CEA and CRP were collected from medical charts.
RESULTS: In total nine proteins; chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 23 (CCL23), 
cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28), 
decorin (DCN), galectin-1 (Gal-1), granzyme B (GZMB), granzyme H (GZMH), matrix 
metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were 
strongly correlated (Spearman's Rho ≤ -0.6 or ≥ 0.6) with either cognitive 
functioning (DCN), emotional functioning (DCN, MCP-1), dyspnoea (CD28, GZMB, 
GZMH) or insomnia (CCL23, CD4, Gal-1, MMP7) during treatment. Associations 
between routine laboratory parameters (CA 19-9, CA-125, CRP, CEA and albumin) 
and HRQoL factors were overall weaker. None of the investigated proteins were 
associated with pain.
CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first study exploring associations 
between serum biomarkers and HRQoL in patients with pancreatic or other 
periampullary cancer, and some findings merit further validation. The 
associations of DCN and MCP-1with impaired cognitive and/or emotional 
functioning are of particular interest, given their established link to various 
neurodegenerative conditions. Chemotherapy is known to cause persistent 
cognitive dysfunction with effects on memory and executive function, referred to 
as "chemo brain". It would therefore be of great value to identify biomarkers 
for early detection and management of this debilitating condition.

BACKGROUND: In minimally invasive lateral plate osteosynthesis of the humerus 
(MILPOH) the plate is introduced through a deltoid split proximally and advanced 
through the central portion of the deltoid insertion and between bone and 
brachial muscle to the distal aspect of the humerus. The fracture is then 
indirectly reduced and bridged by the plate. Whereas it has been shown that the 
strong anterior and posterior parts of the distal deltoid insertion remain 
intact with this maneuver, its impact on deltoid muscle strength and muscular 
morphology remains unclear. It was the aim of this study to evaluate deltoid 
muscle function and MR-morphology of the deltoid muscle and its distal insertion 
after MILPOH.
METHODS: Six patients (median age 63 years, range 52-69 years, f/m 5/1) who had 
undergone MILPOH for diaphyseal humeral fractures extending into the proximal 
metaphysis and head (AO 12B/C(i)) between 08/2017 and 08/2020 were included. 
Functional testing was performed for the injured and uninjured extremity 
including strength measurements for 30/60/90° shoulder abduction and flexion at 
least one year postoperatively. Constant-Murley-Score (CMS) including an age-and 
gender-adjusted version, were obtained and compared to the uninjured side. 
Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
(DASH) questionnaire were acquired for the affected extremity. Quality of life 
was measured using the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-5D-5 L VAS). MR imaging was 
performed for both shoulders accordingly at the time of follow-up to assess the 
integrity of the distal insertion, muscle mass and fatty degeneration of the 
deltoid muscle. Muscle mass was determined by measuring the area of the deltoid 
muscle on the axial MR image at the height of the center of the humeral head.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 29 months (range 12-48 months). Median difference 
of abduction strength after MILPOH was + 13% for 30°, 0% for 60° and - 22% for 
90°. For flexion, the difference to the uninjured side was measured 5% for 30°, 
-7% for 60° and - 12% for 90°. Median CMS was 75 (66-82) for the operated 
extremity compared to 82 (77-90) for the uninjured side. Age- and gender-adapted 
CMS was calculated 88 (79-99) vs. 96 (89-107). Median OSS was 47 (40-48). DASH 
was 26 (15-36). EQ-5D-5 L VAS ranged from 81 to 95 with a median of 90. The 
median difference of the deltoid muscle area on MRI was 2% (-21% to + 53%) 
compared to the uninjured side. No fatty degeneration of the deltoid muscle was 
observed. The weaker central part of the distal deltoid insertion was 
exclusively perforated by the plate, leaving the strong anterior and posterior 
parts of the insertion intact in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MILPOH was associated with good functional and subjective outcome. 
Minor impairment of abduction strength was observed with increasing abduction 
angles. The reason for this impairment is unclear since MILPOH did not affect 
the structural quality of the deltoid muscle and the integrity of the strong 
anterior and posterior parts of its insertion remained intact.

Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the excessive 
production of homogentisic acid, leading to the formation and deposition of 
pigment polymers throughout the body. It is extremely rare, affecting only 
around one in 100,000 individuals. Despite the normal life expectancy, it can 
cause severe morbidities. Alkaptonuria is typically managed supportively with 
pain medication, dietary modifications, and surgical interventions, which are 
considered to be the gold standard of therapy. Here we present a case of a 
33-year-old male with no previous medical or surgical history who presented with 
severe acute back pain radiating to the left leg. Genetic testing confirmed a 
homozygous pathogenic variant for alkaptonuria. This case highlights the 
challenges in diagnosing alkaptonuria, emphasizing the significance of early 
detection, and clinical evaluation for improved outcomes. Furthermore, it 
underscores the need to consider alkaptonuria as a multidimensional disease, 
necessitating further research to enhance our understanding and develop 
effective management. Therefore, this study serves as an opportunity for future 
trials and studies aimed at digging deeper into the intricacies of alkaptonuria 
to increase our understanding and establish comprehensive management plans for 
affected individuals.

Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana.

PURPOSE: Alcohol-related myopathy is one of the earliest alcohol-associated 
pathological tissue changes that is progressively exacerbated by cumulative 
long-term alcohol misuse. Acute and chronic alcohol use leads to changes in 
skeletal muscle mass and function. As discussed in this evidence-based review, 
alcohol-mediated mechanisms are multifactorial with effects on anabolic and 
catabolic signaling, mitochondrial bioenergetics, extracellular matrix 
remodeling, and epigenomic alterations. However, systematic studies are limited, 
especially regarding the acute effects of alcohol on skeletal muscle.
SEARCH METHODS: This review focuses on peer-reviewed manuscripts published 
between January 2012 and November 2022 using the search terms "alcohol" or 
"ethanol" and "skeletal muscle" in MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science using 
EndNote reference management software.
SEARCH RESULTS: Eligible manuscripts included full-length research papers that 
discussed acute and chronic effects of alcohol on skeletal muscle mass and 
function in both clinical and preclinical studies. The review also includes 
alcohol-mediated skeletal muscle effects in the context of comorbidities. The 
three databases together yielded 708 manuscripts. Of these, the authors excluded 
from this review 548 papers that did not have "alcohol" or "muscle" in the title 
and 64 papers that were duplicates or did not discuss skeletal muscle. Thus, of 
all the manuscripts considered for this review, 96 are included and 612 are 
excluded. Additionally, relevant papers published earlier than 2012 are included 
to provide context to the review.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Both acute and chronic alcohol use decrease protein 
synthesis and increase protein degradation. Alcohol also impairs mitochondrial 
function and extracellular matrix remodeling. However, there is a gap in the 
literature on the known alcohol-mediated mechanisms, including senescence, role 
of immune activation, and interorgan communication, on the development of 
alcohol-related myopathy. With increased life expectancy, changing alcohol use 
patterns, and increasing frequency of alcohol use among females, current 
observational studies are needed on the prevalence of alcohol-related myopathy. 
Additionally, the compounding effects of acute and chronic alcohol use on 
skeletal muscle with aging or exercise, in response to injury or disuse, and in 
the context of comorbidities including diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), call for further investigation. Though evidence suggests that abstinence 
or reducing alcohol use can improve muscle mass and function, they are not 
restored to normal levels. Hence, understanding the pathophysiological 
mechanisms can help in the design of therapeutic strategies to improve skeletal 
muscle health.

At least since the Age of Enlightenment, good health has been a tenet for 
society. Healthy societies could learn better, work harder, improve their 
wealth, and live longer. Today societies focus on life expectancy, as we value 
long and healthy lives. As illustrated by the provision of COVID-19 vaccines 
first for the elderly, societies value life-saving actions. Paradoxically, 
health economic assessments conventionally devalue long-lasting health through 
the practice of discounting health benefits along with costs. However, health, 
with its intrinsic and instrumental characteristics, is not synonymous with 
money cash, a tradeable asset that devalues with time. If improving healthy life 
expectancy is a societal ambition, it seems counter-intuitive to value future 
health less as a result of an artificial mathematical construct when evaluating 
economically new medical interventions. In this paper, we investigate the 
application of discounting health in healthcare and consider paradoxical 
findings, especially in relation to disease prevention with vaccination. We 
argue that there is no economically sustainable argument to discount health 
gains, except for the benefit of the payer with a goal of spending less on 
life-saving products. If that is the objective for discounting health, there are 
other means to achieve the same goal in a more transparent and simpler way. From 
the long-term perspective of healthcare development, not discounting health 
gains would encourage research that values long-term effects. This in turn has 
the potential to benefit the investor, the payer, and the patient/consumer, 
improving the situation from multiple perspectives.

Background: Underlying stroke is often misdiagnosed in patients presenting with 
dizziness. Although such patients are usually ineligible for acute stroke 
treatment, accurate diagnosis may still improve outcomes through selection of 
patients for secondary prevention measures. Objective: To investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of differing neuroimaging approaches in the evaluation of 
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with dizziness who are not 
candidates for acute intervention. Methods: A Markov decision-analytic model was 
constructed from a healthcare system perspective for evaluation of a patient 
presenting to the ED with dizziness. Four diagnostic strategies were compared: 
noncontrast CT head, head and neck CTA, conventional brain MRI, and specialized 
MRI (including multiplanar high-resolution DWI). Differing long-term costs and 
outcomes related to stroke detection and secondary prevention were compared. 
Cost-effectiveness was calculated in terms of life-time expenditures in 2022 
U.S. dollars for each quality-adjusted life year (QALY); deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Specialized MRI 
resulted in the highest QALYs and was the most cost-effective strategy with 
$13,477 greater cost and 0.48 greater QALYs compared to noncontrast head CT. 
Conventional MRI had the next-highest health benefit, although was dominated by 
extension with incremental cost of $6756 and 0.25 QALYs; CTA was also dominated 
by extension, with incremental cost of $3952 for 0.13 QALY. Non-contrast CT 
alone had the lowest utility among imaging choices. In the deterministic 
sensitivity analyses, specialized MRI remained the most cost-effective strategy. 
Conventional MRI was more cost-effective than CTA across a wide range of model 
parameters, with incremental cost-effectiveness remaining less than 
$30,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis yielded similar results as 
found in the base-case analysis, with specialized MRI being more cost-effective 
than conventional MRI, which in turn was more cost-effective than CTA. 
Conclusion: Use of MRI in patients presenting to the ED with dizziness improves 
stroke detection and selection for subsequent preventive measures. MRI-based 
evaluation leads to lower long-term costs and higher cumulative QALYs. Clinical 
Impact: MRI, incorporating specialized protocols when available, is the 
preferred approach for evaluation of patients presenting to the ED with 
dizziness, in order to establish a stroke diagnosis and to select patients for 
secondary prevention measures.

The symbiont-associated (SA) environmental package is a new extension to the 
minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS) standards, established by the 
Parasite Microbiome Project (PMP) consortium, in collaboration with the Genomics 
Standard Consortium. The SA was built upon the host-associated MIxS standard, 
but reflects the nestedness of symbiont-associated microbiota within and across 
host-symbiont-microbe interactions. This package is designed to facilitate the 
collection and reporting of a broad range of metadata information that apply to 
symbionts such as life history traits, association with one or multiple host 
organisms, or the nature of host-symbiont interactions along the 
mutualism-parasitism continuum. To better reflect the inherent nestedness of all 
biological systems, we present a novel feature that allows users to co-localize 
samples, to nest a package within another package, and to identify replicates. 
Adoption of the MIxS-SA and of the new terms will facilitate reports of complex 
sampling design from a myriad of environments.

The Concept of Active Longevity in Russia's Policy on Aging.

Martynova L(1).

Jyväskylä, Finland.

Since the 1960s, the goal of active longevity has been mentioned repeatedly in 
Russian policy documents on aging and aging-related research. Analyzing current 
policy documents revealed divergences in the ways the term was interpreted, 
which in turn allowed for aging policy to develop in more than one direction. 
One policy development path considers active longevity to be more or less 
synonymous with the active aging concept. It focuses on older people's 
potential, and measures policy progress according to the Active Longevity Index 
(ALI). Another takes a more holistic approach, seeing active longevity as a 
policy goal in itself, alongside healthy aging, employment, social 
participation, and older people's contribution to society in ways that suit 
them. The latter approach accords with previous policy implementations in Russia 
and with extensive research data collected from various Russian regions since 
the 1940s. Preliminary observations on active longevity policy implementations 
show progress in health-care development and multiple opportunities for older 
people` social participation. However, data on older people's employment and 
life expectancy challenge the effectiveness of policy and cast doubt on the 
reliability of the ALI. A more flexible approach and the application of 
accumulated data and knowledge may assist in achieving active longevity policy 
goals.

Even during the conflict, agricultural extension by the Palestinian Authority 
has played an important role in agricultural development in the West Bank of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). The Ministry of Agriculture of the 
Palestinian Authority provided the necessary agricultural extension services for 
Palestinian farmers affected by the Israeli settlements and Segregation Wall. 
Despite such importance of agricultural extension, few quantitative studies have 
examined its effect on Palestinian farmers. Therefore, the objective of this 
study was to quantify the effect of agricultural extension on technology 
adoption by Palestinian farmers for appropriate evaluation of the agricultural 
policies by the Palestinian Authority. The microdata of 79,446 agricultural 
holdings from the Agricultural Census 2010, which was the only microdata 
officially published and available at the time of this study, was used. Then, 
the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was employed to mitigate the 
endogenous bias caused by self-selection by farmers in receiving the 
agricultural extension. The results showed that agricultural extension has 
positively and significantly affected the adoption of five technologies, namely 
improved crop varieties, chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers, pesticides, 
and biological control. The estimated increase in the adoption rate of those 
technologies as the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) by the 
nearest-neighbor matching method were by 7.1, 7.7, 5.4, 6.8, and 3.8 percentage 
points respectively. This study proved that agricultural extension promoted the 
adoption of those technologies even in the conflict. Therefore, agricultural 
extension by the Palestinian Authority plays an important role in farming by 
Palestinian farmers. In order to maintain and improve farmers' livelihoods 
sustainably, it is necessary to continue the agricultural extension by the 
Palestinian Authority in the future, considering the behavior of farmers.

In this study, the authors investigate the preservative capabilities of edible 
coatings comprising a blend of chitosan, furcellaran and gelatin hydrolysate 
enhanced with the bioactive peptides RW4 and LL37. The preservative effects on 
pork samples stored for 21 days at 4 °C and 6 months at -20 °C were studied, 
while examining changes in microbiological contamination, pH levels, water 
activity and sensory attributes. Microbiological analyses reveal the coatings' 
antimicrobial efficacy against aerobic bacteria, microscopic fungi and yeasts, 
particularly during the initial storage period, when coated samples exhibit 
microbial reductions of 0.5-2 log CFU/g compared to the controls. The coatings 
have no discernible impact on water activity during storage in refrigerated or 
freezer conditions. Notably, differences in pH development can be observed 
between the coated and control samples, potentially attributable to the 
antimicrobial action of the coatings. Sensory analysis allows to highlight the 
inhibition of deterioration related to sensory attributes through the use of 
edible coatings. In conclusion, employing bioactive peptide-enriched edible 
coatings holds promise for extending the shelf-life of perishable foods.

The total anaerobic contribution (AC[La-]+PCr) is a valid and reliable 
methodology. However, the active muscle mass plays an important role in the 
AC[La-]+PCr determination, which might influence its reliability. Thus, this 
study aimed to investigate the effects of two exhaustive intensities on the 
reliability of the AC[La-]+PCr during a one-legged knee extension (1L-KE) 
exercise. Thirteen physically active males were submitted to a graded exercise 
to determine the peak power output (PPO) in the 1L-KE. Then, two constant-load 
exercises were conducted to task failure at 100% (TTF100) and 110% (TTF110) of 
PPO and repeated on a third day. The blood lactate accumulation and the oxygen 
uptake after exercise were used to estimate the anaerobic lactic and anaerobic 
alactic contributions, respectively. Higher values of AC[La-]+PCr were found 
after the TTF100 compared to TTF110 (p = 0.042). In addition, no significant 
differences (p = 0.432), low systematic error (80.9 mL), and a significant ICC 
(0.71; p = 0.004) were found for AC[La-]+PCr in the TTF100. However, an elevated 
coefficient of variation was found (13.7 %). In conclusion, we suggest the use 
of the exhaustive efforts performed at 100% of the PPO with the 1L-KE model, but 
its elevated variability must be carefully considered in future studies.

The availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has revolutionized 
the care of people living with HIV (PLHIV). As a result, PLHIV now have a life 
expectancy comparable with that of the general population. PLHIV are 
increasingly confronted with age-related comorbidities and geriatric syndromes, 
including frailty and polypharmacy, which occur at a higher prevalence and set 
in at an earlier age compared with their uninfected counterparts. The underlying 
pathophysiology for multimorbidity and polypharmacy are multifactorial, 
multidimensional and complex. Therefore, regular review and optimization of risk 
factors to maintain physical function, social and psychological health is of 
utmost importance. With an ever-growing population of older PLHIV, there is a 
pressing need to provide holistic care to address these emerging issues. 
Accelerated aging observed in PLHIV suggests that early involvement of a 
multidisciplinary team, including geriatricians, and implementation of 
integrated models of care can potentially improve the care of older PLHIV, who 
are at increased risk of frailty and complex multimorbidity. This article 
reviews the current global situation, discusses the challenges involved and 
suggests approaches to deliver comprehensive care for older PLHIV. Geriatr
