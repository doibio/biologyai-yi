to the heart's stress. Notably, these risks increase when diabetes, 
hypertension, high cholesterol, and glucose intolerance are present. It has a 
detrimental effect on peripheral blood vessels, raising the possibility of 
thromboangiitis obliterans. Stroke risk is known to be increased by smoking. As 
compared to those who continue to smoke, those who give up smoking have a much 
longer life expectancy. Chronic cigarette smoking has been shown to affect the 
macrophages' ability to remove cholesterol. Abstinence from smoking enhances the 
function of high-density lipoproteins and cholesterol efflux, lowering the risk 
of plaque buildup. In this review, we present the most recent information 
regarding the causal relationship between smoking and cardiovascular health as 
well as the long-term advantages of quitting.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to investigate gender differences 
in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and DFLE/LE ratio among older adults 
in China; portray changing trend from 2010 to 2020; and discuss the implications 
for public policies.
METHODS: Mortality data and disability rate data were derived from the Sixth 
China Population Census in 2010 and the Seventh China Population Census in 2020. 
The study assessed disability status of older adults based on self-assessment 
health in the above censuses. Life table and Sullivan method were used to 
estimate LE, DFLE, and DFLE/LE ratio by gender.
RESULTS: DFLE increased from 19.33 to 21.78 years for 60-year-old males, while 
from 21.94 to 24.80 years for 60-year-old females, from 2010 to 2020, 
respectively. DFLE/LE ratio was 96.40% for 60-year-old males and 94.86% for 
60-year-old females in 2010, while DFLE/LE ratio was 96.63% for 60-year-old 
males and 95.44% for 60-year-old females in 2020, respectively. In terms of 
gender differences in DFLE/LE ratio, men aged 60 are 1.19 percentage points 
higher than women at the same age; men aged 70 are 1.71 percentage points higher 
than women; men aged 80 are 2.87 percentage points higher than women.
CONCLUSION: From 2010 to 2020, the DFLE of China's male and female older adults 
increased simultaneously with the increase of LE, and the DFLE/LE ratio also 
increased. However, the DFLE/LE ratio of female older adults is lower than that 
of male at the same age, and this gender difference is narrowing over the decade 
but has not yet been eliminated, especially the health disadvantage of female 
older adults among the oldest old age group (age 80 and above) is more 
prominent.

Objectives: It's evident that women have a longer life expectancy than men. This 
study investigates the spatiotemporal trends of gender gaps in life expectancy 
(GGLE). It demonstrates the spatiotemporal difference of the influence factors 
of population-weighted air pollution (pwPM2.5) and urbanization on GGLE. 
Methods: Panel data on GGLE and influencing factors from 134 countries from 1960 
to 2018 are collected. The Bayesian spatiotemporal model is performed. Results: 
The results show an obvious spatial heterogeneity worldwide with a continuously 
increasing trend of GGLE. Bayesian spatiotemporal regression reveals a 
significant positive relationship between pwPM2.5, urbanization, and GGLE with 
the spatial random effects. Further, the regression coefficients present obvious 
geographic disparities across space worldwide. Conclusion: In sum, 
social-economic development and air quality improvement should be considered 
comprehensively in global policy to make a fair chance for both genders to 
maximize their health gains.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a microsimulation model to estimate the 
health effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of public health and clinical 
interventions for preventing/managing type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: We combined newly developed equations for complications, mortality, 
risk factor progression, patient utility, and cost-all based on US studies-in a 
microsimulation model. We performed internal and external validation of the 
model. To demonstrate the model's utility, we predicted remaining life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime medical cost for a 
representative cohort of 10 000 US adults with type 2 diabetes. We then 
estimated the cost-effectiveness of reducing hemoglobin A1c from 9% to 7% among 
adults with type 2 diabetes, using low-cost, generic, oral medications.
RESULTS: The model performed well in internal validation; the average absolute 
difference between simulated and observed incidence for 17 complications was < 
8%. In external validation, the model was better at predicting outcomes in 
clinical trials than in observational studies. The cohort of US adults with type 
2 diabetes was projected to have an average of 19.95 remaining life-years (from 
mean age 61), incur $187 729 in discounted medical costs, and accrue 8.79 
discounted QALYs. The intervention to reduce hemoglobin A1c increased medical 
costs by $1256 and QALYs by 0.39, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $9103 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Using equations exclusively derived from US studies, this new 
microsimulation model achieves good prediction accuracy in US populations. The 
model can be used to estimate the long-term health impact, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of interventions for type 2 diabetes in the United States.

Higher temperatures enhance ectothermic metabolism and development, which can 
reduce individual health and life expectancy, and therefore increase their 
vulnerability to climate warming. However, the mechanistic causes and 
consequences of such a temperature-driven impact remain unclear. Our study aimed 
to address two questions: (1) does climate warming alter early-life growth and 
physiology, and, if so, what are the associated carry-over effects in terms of 
reduced survival, increased oxidative stress and telomere shortening? (2) can 
oxidative stress and telomere dynamics at early life stages predict the effect 
of climate warming on individual survival? To answer these questions, we 
conducted a longitudinal experiment under semi-natural conditions where we 
exposed multiocellated racerunner (Eremias multiocellata) to warming conditions 
from juvenile to adult stages. We found that exposure to climate warming 
enhanced growth rates, induced oxidative stress, and shortened telomere length 
of juvenile lizards. Warming conditions did not induce carry-over effects in 
terms of altered growth rate or physiology but resulted in increased mortality 
risk in the later life. Intriguingly, telomere shortening in young individuals 
was associated with mortality risk later in life. This study improves our 
mechanistic understanding of how global warming impacts on ectotherms' 
life-history traits, which encourages the inclusion of physiological information 
in assessing species vulnerability to climate change.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern due to 
its high mortality risk, high hospitalization rates and cost, and low life 
expectancy. Thus, CKD patients are among patient group that may benefit from 
clinical pharmacy services the most.
METHODS: This was a prospective interventional study conducted between October 
1, 2019, and March 18, 2020, in the nephrology ward of Ankara University School 
of the Medicine, Ibn-i Sina Hospital. DRPs were classified according to PCNE 
v8.03. The main outcomes were interventions proposed and the rate of acceptance 
by the physicians.
RESULTS: 269 pre-dialysis patients were included to determine DRPs during the 
treatment process of the patients. 205 DRPs were found in 131 (48.7%) patients. 
Treatment efficacy was found to be the main type of DRPs (56.2%) followed by 
treatment safety (39.6%). When patients with and without DRPs were compared, it 
was found that the number of female patients (55.0%) was higher in the group 
with DRPs (p < 0.05). The length of hospital stays (11.3 ± 7.7) and the mean 
number of drugs used (9.6 ± 3.6) in the group with DRPs were significantly 
higher than those without DRPs (9.3 ± 5.9; 8.1 ± 3.5, respectively) (p < 0.05). 
91.7% of the interventions were accepted by the physicians, and patients and 
found clinically beneficial. 71.7% of DRPs were fully resolved, 1.9% partially 
resolved and 23.4% could not be resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of DRPs in patients with chronic kidney disease 
was determined during therapy. Clinical pharmacist interventions were highly 
accepted by the physicians and patients. This may indicate implementation of 
clinical pharmacy services in the nephrology ward has a great impact on 
optimized therapy and prevention DRPs.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 
has reported that HIV/AIDS continues to take a disproportionate toll on global 
health. However, the trends in global inequality of HIV/AIDS burden have 
remained ambiguous over the past two decades. The objectives of our study were 
to assess the socioeconomic inequalities, and temporal trends of HIV/AIDS across 
186 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019.
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2019, and conducted a cross-national 
time-series analysis. Age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) 
rates were used to measure the global burden of HIV/AIDS. Gross national income 
(GNI) per capita was used to approximate the national socioeconomic status. 
Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between 
age-standardized DALY rates due to HIV/AIDS and GNI per capita. The 
concentration curve and concentration index (CI) were generated to evaluate the 
cross-national socioeconomic inequality of HIV/AIDS burden. A joinpoint 
regression analysis was used to quantify the changes in trends in socioeconomic 
inequality of HIV/AIDS burden from 2000 to 2019.
RESULTS: A decrease in age-standardized DALY rates for HIV/AIDS occurred in 132 
(71%) of 186 countries/territories from 2000 to 2019, of which 52 (39%) 
countries/territories achieved a decrease in DALYs of more than 50%, and 27 
(52%) of the 52 were from sub-Saharan Africa. The concentration curves of the 
age-standardized DALY rates of HIV/AIDS were above the equality line from 2000 
to 2019. The CI rose from - 0.4625 (95% confidence interval - 0.6220 to -0.2629) 
in 2000 to -0.4122 (95% confidence interval - 0.6008 to -0.2235) in 2019. A 
four-phase trend of changes in the CIs of age-standardized DALY rates for 
HIV/AIDS was observed across 2000 to 2019, with an average increase of 0.6% (95% 
confidence interval 0.4 to 0.8, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the burden of HIV/AIDS has decreased over the past two 
decades, accompanied by a trend of narrowing cross-country inequalities of 
HIV/AIDS burden. Moreover, the burden of HIV/AIDS continues to fall primarily in 
low-income countries.

Organelles within eukaryotic cells are not isolated static compartments, instead 
being morphologically diverse and highly dynamic in order to respond to cellular 
needs and carry out their diverse and cooperative functions. One phenomenon 
exemplifying this plasticity, and increasingly gaining attention, is the 
extension and retraction of thin tubules from organelle membranes. While these 
protrusions have been observed in morphological studies for decades, their 
formation, properties and functions are only beginning to be understood. In this 
review, we provide an overview of what is known and still to be discovered about 
organelle membrane protrusions in mammalian cells, focusing on the 
best-characterised examples of these membrane extensions arising from 
peroxisomes (ubiquitous organelles involved in lipid metabolism and reactive 
oxygen species homeostasis) and mitochondria. We summarise the current knowledge 
on the diversity of peroxisomal/mitochondrial membrane extensions, as well as 
the molecular mechanisms by which they extend and retract, necessitating dynamic 
membrane remodelling, pulling forces and lipid flow. We also propose broad 
cellular functions for these membrane extensions in inter-organelle 
communication, organelle biogenesis, metabolism and protection, and finally 
present a mathematical model that suggests that extending protrusions is the 
most efficient way for an organelle to explore its surroundings.

Pelodiscus sinensis (P. sinensis) is a commonly cultivated turtle species with a 
habit of hibernation. To study the changes in histone expression and methylation 
of P. sinensis during hibernation induction, a model was established by 
artificial induction. Physiological and metabolic indices were measured, and the 
expression and localization of histone (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and 
methylation-related genes (ASH2L, KMT2A, KMT2E, KDM1A, KDM1B, and KDM5A) were 
measured by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. 
The results indicated that the metabolism, antioxidation index, and relative 
expression of histone methyltransferase were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), 
whereas the activity and expression of histone demethyltransferase were 
significantly increased (p < 0.05). Although our results showed significant 
changes in physiological and gene expression after hibernation induction, we 
could not confirm that P. sinensis entered deep hibernation. Therefore, for the 
state after cooling-induced hibernation, cold torpor might be a more accurate 
description. The results indicate that the P. sinensis can enter cold torpor 
through artificial induction, and the expression of histones may promote gene 
transcription. Unlike histones expressed under normal conditions, histone 
methylation may activate gene transcription during hibernation induction. 
Western blot analysis revealed that the ASH2L and KDM5A proteins were 
differentially expressed in the testis at different months (p < 0.05), which may 
perform a role in regulating gene transcription. The immunohistochemical 
localization of ASH2L and KDM5A in spermatogonia and spermatozoa suggests that 
ASH2L and KDM5A may perform a role in mitosis and meiosis. In conclusion, this 
study is the first to report changes in histone-related genes in reptiles, which 
provides insight for further studies on the physiological metabolism and histone 
methylation regulation of P. sinensis during the hibernation induction and 
hibernation period.

Cancer is a becoming a huge social and economic burden on society, becoming one 
of the most significant barriers to life expectancy in the 21st century. In 
particular, breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women. One 
of the most significant difficulties to finding efficient therapies for specific 
cancers, such as breast cancer, is the efficiency and ease of drug development 
and testing. Tissue-engineered (TE) in vitro models are rapidly developing as an 
alternative to animal testing for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, porosity 
included within these structures overcomes the diffusional mass transfer limit 
whilst enabling cell infiltration and integration with surrounding tissue. 
Within this study, we investigated the use of high-molecular-weight 
polycaprolactone methacrylate (PCL-M) polymerised high-internal-phase emulsions 
(polyHIPEs) as a scaffold to support 3D breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell culture. 
We assessed the porosity, interconnectivity, and morphology of the polyHIPEs 
when varying mixing speed during formation of the emulsion, successfully 
demonstrating the tunability of these polyHIPEs. An ex ovo chick chorioallantoic 
membrane assay identified the scaffolds as bioinert, with biocompatible 
properties within a vascularised tissue. Furthermore, in vitro assessment of 
cell attachment and proliferation showed promising potential for the use of PCL 
polyHIPEs to support cell growth. Our results demonstrate that PCL polyHIPEs are 
a promising material to support cancer cell growth with tuneable porosity and 
interconnectivity for the fabrication of perfusable 3D cancer models.

This study aimed to identify the best UV-C combined treatments for ensuring the 
safety and quality of fish and meat products. A total of 4592 articles were 
screened in the relevant databases, and 16 were eligible studies. For fish, the 
most effective treatments to reduce Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria 
were UV-C at 0.5 J/cm2 + non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) for 8 min 
(33.83%) and 1% Verdad N6 + 0.05 J/cm2 + vacuum packaging (25.81%), 
respectively. An oxygen absorber with 0.102 J/cm2 was the best combined 
treatment, reducing lipid oxidation (65.59%), protein oxidation (48.95), color 
(ΔE = 4.51), and hardness changes (18.61%), in addition to a shelf-life 
extension of at least 2 days. For meat products, Gram-negative bacteria were 
more reduced by nir-infrared heating (NIR-H; 200.36 µW/cm2/nm) combined with 
0.13 J/cm2 (70.82%) and 0.11 J/cm2 (52.09%). While Gram-positive bacteria by 
0.13 J/cm2 with NIR-H (200.36 µW/cm2/nm), 1, 2, or 4 J/cm2 with flash 
pasteurization (FP) during 1.5 or 3 s, and 2 J/cm2 with FP for 0.75 s 
(58.89-67.77%). LAE (5%) + 0.5 J/cm2 was promising for maintaining color and 
texture. UV-C combined technologies seem to be a cost-effective alternative to 
ensure safety with little to no quality changes in fish and meat products.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the nerve regulation of honey bees (Apis 
mellifera). This study aims to investigate the differences in expression of 
miRNAs in a honey bee's brain for olfactory learning tasks and to explore their 
potential role in a honey bee's olfactory learning and memory. In this study, 12 
day old honey bees with strong and weak olfactory performances were utilized to 
investigate the influence of miRNAs on olfactory learning behavior. The honey 
bee brains were dissected, and a small RNA-seq technique was used for 
high-throughput sequencing. The data analysis of the miRNA sequences revealed 
that 14 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) between the two groups, 
strong (S) and weak (W), for olfactory performance in honey bees were 
identified, which included seven up-regulated and seven down-regulated. The qPCR 
verification results of the 14 miRNAs showed that four miRNAs (miR-184-3p, 
miR-276-3p, miR-87-3p, and miR-124-3p) were significantly associated with 
olfactory learning and memory. The target genes of these DEmiRNAs were subjected 
to the GO database annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The 
functional annotation and pathway analysis showed that the neuroactive 
ligand-receptor interaction pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, biosynthesis of 
amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism, and terpenoid 
backbone biosynthesis may be a great important pathway related to olfactory 
learning and memory in honey bees. Our findings together further explained the 
relationship between olfactory performance and the brain function of honey bees 
at the molecular level and provides a basis for further study on miRNAs related 
to olfactory learning and memory in honey bees.

The objective of this systematic review is to present older individuals' views 
on the advance care planning (ACP) process and the factors affecting those 
opinions. The review contains search terms predetermined in the databases of 
CINAHL, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Academic Search Ultimate, Web of Science, Master 
FILE, and TR Dizin over the last 10 years (1 January 2012-31 December 2021) in 
English and Turkish. The studies were included in the research using inclusion 
(sample age ≥ 50, focusing on individuals' opinions on ACP) and exclusion 
(articles whose samples consisted of individuals with a specific disease, 
non-research articles) criteria. Quality assessment was conducted using the 
Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis was used to collate 
findings. The most striking results are the positive perspectives increasing in 
parallel with the individuals' level of knowledge and experience about ACP. 
Variables affecting their views are advanced age, marital status, socioeconomic 
status, perception of remaining life expectancy, self-perceived health, number 
and stage of chronic diseases, religion, and cultural characteristics. This 
study offers guidance on the application and dissemination of ACP, empowering 
the use of this practice given the perspectives of older adults on ACP and the 
factors that affect them that the data show.

The gut microbiota (GM) has been the subject of intense research in recent 
years. Therefore, numerous factors affecting its composition have been 
thoroughly examined, and with them, their function and role in the individual's 
systems. The gut microbiota's taxonomical composition dramatically impacts older 
adults' health status. In this regard, it could either extend their life 
expectancy via the modulation of metabolic processes and the immune system or, 
in the case of dysbiosis, predispose them to age-related diseases, including 
bowel inflammatory and musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic and neurological 
disorders. In general, the microbiome of the elderly tends to present taxonomic 
and functional changes, which can function as a target to modulate the 
microbiota and improve the health of this population. The GM of centenarians is 
unique, with the faculty-promoting metabolic pathways capable of preventing and 
counteracting the different processes associated with age-related diseases. The 
molecular mechanisms by which the microbiota can exhibit anti-ageing properties 
are mainly based on anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. This review 
focuses on analysing the current knowledge of gut microbiota characteristics and 
modifiers, its relationship with ageing, and the GM-modulating approaches to 
increase life expectancy.

of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman 11622, Jordan.

BACKGROUND: Due to an expansion in the usage of medications (such as anticancer 
therapies), increased exposure to noise, and an increase in life expectancy, the 
prevalence of inner ear disease-related hearing loss is rising. Diseases of the 
inner ear are frequently accompanied by other conditions, such as chronic heart 
failure, systemic inflammation, arterial hypertension, and cerebrovascular 
disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of hospital 
admissions linked to inner ear diseases in England and Wales.
METHOD: This was an ecological descriptive study using public medical databases 
in England and Wales. Diagnostic codes for diseases of the inner ear (H80-H83) 
were used to identify all hospital admissions. Between 1999 and 2020, the 
chi-squared test was used to assess the difference between the admission rates.
RESULTS: From 5704 in 1999 to 19,097 in 2020, the total annual number of 
hospital admissions increased by 234.8%, which corresponds to a 192.3% increase 
in the admission rate [from 10.94 (95% CI 10.66-11.22) in 1999 to 31.98 (95% CI 
31.52-32.43) in 2020 per 100,000 people, p < 0.01]. "Disorders of vestibular 
function" and "other inner ear diseases" were the most frequent causes of 
hospital admissions due to inner ear diseases, accounting for 47.6% and 43.6%, 
respectively. The age range of 15 to 59 years accounted for 42.3% of all 
diseases of the inner ear hospital admissions. Around 59.6% of all admissions 
were made by females. The female admission rate increased by 210.1% (from 12.43 
(95% CI 12.01-12.85) in 1999 to 38.54 (95% CI 37.84-39.24) in 2020 per 100,000 
people). The male admission rate for diseases of the inner ear increased by 
169.6% [from 9.37 (95% CI 9.00-9.75) in 1999 to 25.26 (95% CI 24.69-25.84) per 
100,000 people] in 2020.
CONCLUSION: Inner ear disease admissions increased markedly in England and Wales 
during the past two decades. Females and the middle-aged population were at 
higher risk of being admitted for inner ear diseases. Further cohort studies are 
warranted to identify other risk factors and develop effective prevention 
strategies.

Reviving the neuronal functions in neurodegenerative disorders requires the 
promotion of neurite outgrowth. Thymol, which is a principal component of 
Trachyspermum ammi seed extract (TASE), is reported to have neuroprotective 
effects. However, the effects of thymol and TASE on neuronal differentiation and 
outgrowth are yet to be studied. This study is the first report investigating 
the neuronal growth and maturation effects of TASE and thymol. Pregnant mice 
were orally supplemented with TASE (250 and 500 mg/kg), thymol (50 and 100 
mg/kg), vehicle, and positive controls. The supplementation significantly 
upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and early 
neuritogenesis markers in the pups' brains at post-natal day 1 (P1). Similarly, 
the BDNF level was significantly upregulated in the P12 pups' brains. 
Furthermore, TASE (75 and 100 µg/mL) and thymol (10 and 20 µM) enhanced the 
neuronal polarity, early neurite arborization, and maturation of hippocampal 
neurons in a dose-dependent manner in primary hippocampal cultures. The 
stimulatory activities of TASE and thymol on neurite extension involved TrkB 
signaling, as evidenced by attenuation via ANA-12 (5 µM), which is a specific 
TrkB inhibitor. Moreover, TASE and thymol rescued the nocodazole-induced blunted 
neurite extension in primary hippocampal cultures, suggesting their role as a 
potent microtubule stabilizing agent. These findings demonstrate the potent 
capacities of TASE and thymol in promoting neuronal development and 
reconstruction of neuronal circuitry, which are often compromised in 
neurodegenerative diseases and acute brain injuries.

Plasma Clearance of Coagulation Factor VIII and Extension of Its Half-Life for 
the Therapy of Hemophilia A: A Critical Review of the Current State of Research 
and Practice.

Administration, Silver Spring, MD 20993, USA.

Factor VIII (FVIII) is an important component of blood coagulation as its 
congenital deficiency results in life-threatening bleeding. Current prophylactic 
therapy of the disease (hemophilia A) is based on 3-4 intravenous infusions of 
therapeutic FVIII per week. This poses a burden on patients, demanding reduction 
of infusion frequency by using FVIII with extended plasma half-life (EHL). 
Development of these products requires understanding FVIII plasma clearance 
mechanisms. This paper overviews (i) an up-to-date state of the research in this 
field and (ii) current EHL FVIII products, including recently approved 
efanesoctocog alfa, for which the plasma half-life exceeds a biochemical barrier 
posed by von Willebrand factor, complexed with FVIII in plasma, which results in 
~1 per week infusion frequency. We focus on the EHL FVIII products' structure 
and function, in particular related to the known discrepancy in results of 
one-stage clotting (OC) and chromogenic substrate (CS) assays used to assign the 
products' potency, dosing, and for clinical monitoring in plasma. We suggest a 
possible root cause of these assays' discrepancy that is also pertinent to EHL 
factor IX variants used to treat hemophilia B. Finally, we discuss approaches in 
designing future EHL FVIII variants, including those to be used for hemophilia A 
gene therapy.

The extension of human life makes it more and more important to prevent and 
treat diseases of the elderly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
osteoporosis. Little is known about the effects of drugs used in the treatment 
of AD on the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate the effects of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the 
musculoskeletal system in rats with normal and reduced estrogen levels. The 
study was carried out on four groups of mature female rats: non-ovariectomized 
(NOVX) control rats, NOVX rats treated with donepezil, ovariectomized (OVX) 
control rats and OVX rats treated with donepezil. Donepezil (1 mg/kg p.o.) was 
administered for four weeks, starting one week after the ovariectomy. The serum 
concentrations of CTX-I, osteocalcin and other biochemical parameters, bone 
mass, density, mineralization, histomorphometric parameters and mechanical 
properties, and skeletal muscle mass and strength were examined. Estrogen 
deficiency increased bone resorption and formation and worsened cancellous bone 
mechanical properties and histomorphometric parameters. In NOVX rats, donepezil 
decreased bone volume to tissue volume ratio in the distal femoral metaphysis, 
increased the serum phosphorus concentration and tended to decrease skeletal 
muscle strength. No significant bone effects of donepezil were observed in OVX 
rats. The results of the present study indicate slightly unfavorable effects of 
donepezil on the musculoskeletal system in rats with normal estrogen levels.

Palliative surgery is performed to improve the quality of life of patients with 
spinal metastases. However, it is sometimes difficult to achieve the expected 
results because the patient's condition, and risk factors related to poor 
outcomes have not been well elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the 
functional outcomes and investigate the risk factors for poor outcomes after 
palliative surgery for spinal metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed the 
records of 117 consecutive patients who underwent palliative surgery for spinal 
metastases. Neurological and ambulatory statuses were evaluated pre- and 
post-operatively. Poor outcomes were defined as no improvement or deterioration 
in functional status or early mortality, and the related risk factors were 
analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results showed 
neurological improvement in 48% and ambulatory improvement in 70% of the 
patients with preoperative impairment, whereas 18% of the patients showed poor 
outcomes. In the multivariate analysis, low hemoglobin levels and low revised 
Tokuhashi scores were identified as risk factors for poor outcomes. The present 
results suggest that anemia and low revised Tokuhashi scores are related not 
only to life expectancy but also to functional recovery after surgery. Treatment 
options should be carefully selected for the patients with these factors.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a new epidemic which has presented an immense increase 
in recent decades, due to the rapid increase in obesity. Cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) significantly reduces life expectancy and is the main cause of death in 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Strict glycemic control is a well-established 
method to combat microvascular CVD of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); its role 
against CVD of the T2DM risk has not been well documented. Therefore, the most 
efficient prevention is multifactorial risk factor reduction. Recently, the 
European Society of Cardiology published its 2019 recommendations on CVD in DM. 
Although all clinical points were discussed in this document, only a few 
comments were presented about when and how we should recommend cardiovascular 
(CV) imaging. Currently, CV imaging is the "must" in CV noninvasive evaluation. 
Alterations in CV imaging parameters can lead to early recognition of various 
types of CVD. In this paper, we briefly discuss the role of noninvasive imaging 
modalities, emphasizing the benefits of including cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance (CMR) in the evaluation of DM. CMR, in the same examination, can 
provide an assessment of tissue characterization, perfusion and function, with 
excellent reproducibility and without radiation or limitations, due to the body 
habitus. Therefore, it can play a dominant role in the prevention and risk 
stratification of DM. The suggested protocol for DM evaluation should include 
routine annual echocardiographic evaluation of all DM patients and CMR 
assessment of those with poorly controlled DM, microalbuminuria, heart failure, 
arrhythmia and recent alterations in clinical or echocardiographic evaluation.
