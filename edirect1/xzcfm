recipients experienced fatal serious adverse events suspected to be study 
drug-related.
INTERPRETATION: No new safety concerns were noted with eltrombopag and the trial 
met the primary objective of a reduction in CRTEs; eltrombopag might be a 
treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS who are 
ineligible for other treatment and who are not receiving disease-modifying 
treatment.

CONTEXT: For patients with metastatic cancer and limited life expectancy, 
potential benefits of chemotherapy must be balanced against harms to quality of 
life near death and increased out-of-pocket costs of care.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between chemotherapy use by patients 
with Stage IV pancreatic cancer and health care use and Medicare and 
out-of-pocket costs in the last 30 days of life.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3825 patients aged 
66 years or older when diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer in 2006-2011, 
using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. 
Using a propensity score matched sample, we examined associations between 
initiation of chemotherapy shortly after the metastatic diagnosis (and 
secondarily, continued chemotherapy use in the last 30 days of life) and health 
care use and costs (both Medicare payment and patient out-of-pocket costs) in 
the last 30 days of life.
RESULTS: Chemotherapy use was associated with increased rates of hospital 
admissions (45.0% vs. 29.2%, P < 0.001), emergency department visits (41.3% vs. 
27.2%, P < 0.001), and death in a hospital (14.2% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.001); fewer 
days in hospice care (11.5 days vs. 15.7 days, P < 0.001); and more than 50% 
increase in patient out-of-pocket costs for care ($1311.5 vs. $841.0, P < 0.001) 
in the last 30 days of life. Among patients who initiated chemotherapy, more 
stark differences in these outcomes were found by whether patients received 
chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life.
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy use among older patients diagnosed with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer was associated with substantially increased use of health care 
and higher patient out-of-pocket costs near death.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the adaptation of a global health economic model to 
determine whether treatment with the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor 
LCZ696 is cost effective compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor enalapril in adult patients with chronic heart failure with reduced 
left ventricular ejection fraction in the Netherlands; and to explore the effect 
of performing the cost-effectiveness analyses according to the new 
pharmacoeconomic Dutch guidelines (updated during the submission process of 
LCZ696), which require a value-of-information analysis and the inclusion of 
indirect medical costs of life-years gained.
METHODS: We adapted a UK model to reflect the societal perspective in the 
Netherlands by including travel expenses, productivity loss, informal care 
costs, and indirect medical costs during the life-years gained and performed a 
preliminary value-of-information analysis.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio obtained was €17,600 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This was robust to changes in most 
structural assumptions and across different subgroups of patients. Probability 
sensitivity analysis results showed that the probability that LCZ696 is 
cost-effective at a €50,000 per QALY threshold is 99.8%, with a population 
expected value of perfect information of €297,128. On including indirect medical 
costs of life-years gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €26,491 
per QALY gained, and LCZ696 was 99.46% cost effective at €50,000 per QALY, with 
a population expected value of perfect information of €2,849,647.
CONCLUSIONS: LCZ696 is cost effective compared with enalapril under the former 
and current Dutch guidelines. However, the (monetary) consequences of making a 
wrong decision were considerably different in both scenarios.

BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors 
were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 
cholesterol-lowering therapies for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia 
or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the long-term health and economic value of PCSK9 
inhibitors for Americans (51 years and older).
METHODS: We conducted simulations using the Future Elderly Model, an established 
dynamic microsimulation model to project the lifetime outcomes for the US 
population aged 51 years and older. Health effects estimates and confidence 
intervals from published meta-analysis studies were used to project changes in 
life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years, and lifetime medical spending 
resulting from the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. We considered two treatment 
scenarios: 1) current FDA eligibility and 2) an extended eligibility scenario 
that includes patients with no pre-existing cardiovascular disease but at high 
risk. We assumed that the price of PCSK9 inhibitors was discounted by 35% in the 
first 12 years and by 57% thereafter, with gradual uptake of the drug in 
eligible populations.
RESULTS: Use of PCSK9 inhibitors by individuals covered by current FDA approval 
would extend life expectancy at the age of 51 years by an estimated 1.1 years 
and would yield a lifetime net value of $5800 per person. If use was extended to 
those at high risk for cardiovascular disease, PCSK9 inhibitors would generate a 
lifetime net benefit of $14,100 per person.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanded access to PCSK9 inhibitors would offer positive long-term 
net value for patients and the US health care system at the current discounted 
prices.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of basal insulin regimens for 
adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus in England.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted in accordance with the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. The UK National Health 
Service and personal and social services perspective was used and a 3.5% 
discount rate was applied for both costs and outcomes. Relative effectiveness 
estimates were based on a systematic review of published trials and a Bayesian 
network meta-analysis. The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used, in which net 
monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a threshold of £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A wide range of sensitivity analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: Insulin detemir (twice daily) [iDet (bid)] had the highest mean QALY 
gain (11.09 QALYs) and NMB (£181,456) per patient over the model time horizon. 
Compared with the lowest cost strategy (insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn once 
daily), it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £7844/QALY gained. 
Insulin glargine (od) [iGlarg (od)] and iDet (od) were ranked as second and 
third, with NMBs of £180,893 and £180,423, respectively. iDet (bid) remained the 
most cost-effective treatment in all the sensitivity analyses performed except 
when high doses were assumed (>30% increment compared with other regimens), 
where iGlarg (od) ranked first.
CONCLUSIONS: iDet (bid) is the most cost-effective regimen, providing the 
highest QALY gain and NMB. iGlarg (od) and iDet (od) are possible options for 
those for whom the iDet (bid) regimen is not acceptable or does not achieve 
required glycemic control.

BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of early intensive 
treatment versus routine care in individuals with type 2 diabetes detected by 
screening.
OBJECTIVES: To derive a trial-informed estimate of the incremental costs of 
intensive treatment as delivered in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive 
Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care-Europe 
(ADDITION) trial and to revisit the long-term cost-effectiveness analysis from 
the perspective of the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: We analyzed the electronic primary care records of a subsample of the 
ADDITION-Cambridge trial cohort (n = 173). Unit costs of used primary care 
services were taken from the published literature. Incremental annual costs of 
intensive treatment versus routine care in years 1 to 5 after diagnosis were 
calculated using multilevel generalized linear models. We revisited the 
long-term cost-utility analyses for the ADDITION-UK trial cohort and reported 
results for ADDITION-Cambridge using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes 
Model and the trial-informed cost estimates according to a previously developed 
evaluation framework.
RESULTS: Incremental annual costs of intensive treatment over years 1 to 5 
averaged £29.10 (standard error = £33.00) for consultations with general 
practitioners and nurses and £54.60 (standard error = £28.50) for metabolic and 
cardioprotective medication. For ADDITION-UK, over the 10-, 20-, and 30-year 
time horizon, adjusted incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
0.014, 0.043, and 0.048, and adjusted incremental costs were £1,021, £1,217, and 
£1,311, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £71,232/QALY, 
£28,444/QALY, and £27,549/QALY, respectively. Respective incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for ADDITION-Cambridge were slightly higher.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental costs of intensive treatment as delivered in the 
ADDITION-Cambridge trial were lower than expected. Given UK willingness-to-pay 
thresholds in patients with screen-detected diabetes, intensive treatment is of 
borderline cost effectiveness over a time horizon of 20 years and more.

BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is heralded as offering more effective treatments 
to smaller targeted patient populations. In breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy 
is standard for patients considered as high-risk after surgery. Molecular tests 
may identify patients who can safely avoid chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVES: To use economic analysis before a large-scale clinical trial of 
molecular testing to confirm the value of the trial and help prioritize between 
candidate tests as randomized comparators.
METHODS: Women with surgically treated breast cancer (estrogen receptor-positive 
and lymph node-positive or tumor size ≥30 mm) were randomized to standard care 
(chemotherapy for all) or test-directed care using Oncotype DX™. Additional 
testing was undertaken using alternative tests: MammaPrintTM, PAM-50 
(ProsignaTM), MammaTyperTM, IHC4, and IHC4-AQUA™ (NexCourse Breast™). A 
probabilistic decision model assessed the cost-effectiveness of all tests from a 
UK perspective. Value of information analysis determined the most efficient 
publicly funded ongoing trial design in the United Kingdom.
RESULTS: There was an 86% probability of molecular testing being cost-effective, 
with most tests producing cost savings (range -£1892 to £195) and 
quality-adjusted life-year gains (range 0.17-0.20). There were only small 
differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years between tests. Uncertainty 
was driven by long-term outcomes. Value of information demonstrated value of 
further research into all tests, with Prosigna currently being the highest 
priority for further research.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tests are likely to be cost-effective, but an optimal 
test is yet to be identified. Health economics modeling to inform the design of 
a randomized controlled trial looking at diagnostic technology has been 
demonstrated to be feasible as a method for improving research efficiency.

BACKGROUND: Mortality from intra-abdominal candidiasis in intensive care units 
(ICUs) is high. It takes many days for peritoneal-fluid fungal culture to become 
positive, and the recommended empirical antifungal therapy involves excessive 
costs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should produce results more rapidly than 
fungal culture.
OBJECTIVES: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the combination of 
several diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage Candida peritonitis in 
non-neutropenic adult patients in ICUs.
METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness. Cost and effectiveness were taken into account in a 1-year time 
horizon and from the French National Health Insurance perspective. Six 
strategies were compared: fluconazole or echinocandin as an empirical therapy, 
plus diagnosis by fungal culture or detection by PCR of all Candida species, or 
use of PCR to detect most fluconazole-resistant Candida species (i.e., Candida 
krusei and Candida glabrata).
RESULTS: The use of fluconazole empirical treatment and PCR to detect all 
Candida species is more cost effective than using fluconazole empirical 
treatment without PCR (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
€40,055/quality-adjusted life-year). Empirical treatment with echinocandin plus 
PCR to detect C. krusei and C. glabrata is the most effective strategy, but has 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €93,776/quality-adjusted life-year. 
If the cost of echinocandin decreases, then strategies involving PCR plus 
empirical echinocandin become more cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection by PCR of all Candida species and of most 
fluconazole-resistant Candida species could improve the cost-effectiveness of 
fluconazole and echinocandin given to non-neutropenic patients with suspected 
peritoneal candidiasis in ICUs.

OBJECTIVES: To forecast lifetime outcomes and cost of lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
combination therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with homozygous 
phe508del mutation from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed from a US payer perspective. The 
model included five health states: 1) mild lung disease (percent predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] >70%), 2) moderate lung disease (40% 
≤ FEV1 ≤ 70%), 3) severe lung disease (FEV1 < 40%), 4) lung transplantation, and 
5) death. All inputs were derived from published literature. We estimated 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor's improvement in outcomes compared with a non-CF referent 
population as well as CF-specific mortality estimates.
RESULTS: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with additional 2.91 life-years 
(95% credible interval 2.55-3.56) and additional 2.42 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) (95% credible interval 2.10-2.98). Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was 
associated with improvements in survival and QALYs equivalent to 27.6% and 
20.7%, respectively, for the survival and QALY gaps between CF usual care and 
their non-CF peers. The incremental lifetime cost was $2,632,249.
CONCLUSIONS: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor increased life-years and QALYs in CF patients 
with the homozygous phe508del mutation and moved morbidity and mortality closer 
to that of their non-CF peers but it came with higher cost.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results regarding associations of time trade-off (TTO) 
valuations with respondent characteristics have been reported, mostly on the 
basis of regression analyses. Alternative approaches, such as the latent class 
analysis (LCA), may add to the further understanding of variations in TTO 
responses.
OBJECTIVES: To identify whether subgroups of respondents can be identified on 
the basis of their responses to TTO exercises and to investigate which 
respondent characteristics are associated with membership of the identified 
subgroups.
METHODS: Members of the Dutch general public, aged 18 to 65 years, completed a 
Web-based questionnaire concerning sociodemographic characteristics, three TTO 
exercises valuing health states described using the domains of the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire, and preference for quality versus quantity of 
life. LCA was used to identify patterns in the responses. Predictive variables 
were included in the final LCA model to identify the particular respondent 
characteristics that predict subgroup membership.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1067 respondents. Four latent classes were 
identified in the responses to TTO exercises. Two were high traders, focusing on 
quality of life and trading off a relatively high number of years. The other two 
were low traders, focusing on length of life. Predictive analyses revealed 
significant differences between subgroups in terms of age, sex, subjective life 
expectancy, and preference for quantity over quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that distinct classes of respondents can be discerned in 
TTO responses from the general public, distinguishing subgroups of low and high 
traders. More research in this area should confirm our findings and investigate 
their implications for health state valuation exercises.

The ending of dual nomenclatural systems for pleomorphic fungi in 2011 requires 
the reconciliation of competing names, ideally linked through culture based or 
molecular methods. The phylogenetic systematics of Hypocreales and its many 
genera have received extensive study in the last two decades, however resolution 
of competing names in Cordycipitaceae has not yet been addressed. Here we 
present a molecular phylogenetic investigation of Cordycipitaceae that enables 
identification of competing names in this family, and provides the basis upon 
which these names can be maintained or suppressed. The taxonomy presented here 
seeks to harmonize competing names by principles of priority, recognition of 
monophyletic groups, and the practical usage of affected taxa. In total, we 
propose maintaining nine generic names, Akanthomyces, Ascopolyporus, Beauveria, 
Cordyceps, Engyodontium, Gibellula, Hyperdermium, Parengyodontium, and 
Simplicillium and the rejection of eight generic names, Evlachovaea, 
Granulomanus, Isaria, Lecanicillium, Microhilum, Phytocordyceps, 
Synsterigmatocystis, and Torrubiella. Two new generic names, Hevansia and 
Blackwellomyces, and a new species, Beauveria blattidicola, are described. New 
combinations are also proposed in the genera Akanthomyces, Beauveria, 
Blackwellomyces, and Hevansia.

BACKGROUND: Cancer management in the elderly is often considered as suboptimal, 
highly variable, and rarely evidence-based. Data are needed to understand 
decision-making processes in this population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was performed in France to describe 
decision-making in gynaecologic patients over 70. It followed a three-step 
method: (1) 101 representative physicians questioned about treatment decision 
criteria; (2) simplified individual data were collected; (3) as well as detailed 
data patients receiving chemotherapy. This analysis refers to breast cancer 
subgroup of patients.
RESULTS: Main decision criteria were performance status, comorbidities, and 
renal function. In adjuvant setting, the main concern was life expectancy, 
whereas it was quality of life in metastatic setting. Of the 631 patients 
entered in the simplified analysis, 41% had been evaluated by a geriatrician, 
67% received chemotherapy. In the detailed analysis, patients older than 75 were 
more likely to receive a monochemotherapy and to be treated with weekly/divided 
dose. In adjuvant setting, respectively, 19, 55, and 26% of the patients were 
treated with regimen validated in the elderly, validated in a younger 
population, and not validated. A G-CSF was prescribed in 48% of the patients, as 
primary prophylaxis in 78 and in 41% of patients with a risk of febrile 
neutropenia < 10%.
CONCLUSION: Geriatric covariates become an increasing concern in the 
decision-making process. This survey also suggests an insufficient use of 
validated chemotherapy regimens. To date, age remains a risk factor for 
heterogeneity in oncologic practice justifying a persistent effort for 
elaborating and disclosing specific recommendations.

Degenerative diseases are becoming more common with increasing life expectancy 
of the human population. The 20th century faced a progressive demographic change 
in the industrialized world, followed by identical trends in population aging in 
Asia, Africa, and Middle and South America. A significant increase in chronic 
age-dependent disorders will soon cause important challenges for several 
countries. Age-related pathologies are commonly seen in elderly patients. More 
than 40% of adults over 60 years old present a combination of risk factors, 
described as metabolic syndrome, which significantly increases the tendency for 
developing degenerative diseases, and some types of cancers. Among these, 
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases are on the top of the list. 
The discovery of effective cardio- and neuroprotective alternative therapeutics 
that decrease or block disease's progression at early stages, is the main goal 
of research groups working in the field. A wide range of different substituted 
coumarins, and the pharmacological properties they may display, are trend topics 
because of their synthetic accessibility, as well as their abundance in plants 
and other naturally-occurring products. These heterocyclic compounds play an 
important role in a variety of areas, but stand out in the field of Medicinal 
Chemistry. This review provides an overview of the last five years about the 
potential of coumarins as modulators of several physiological mechanisms 
involved in age-related pathologies.

School, Italy.

Consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in minimally processed plant foods has been 
associated with a reduced risk of developing multiple chronic diseases and 
increased life expectancy. Data from several randomized clinic trials have 
demonstrated a beneficial effect in the primary and secondary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. 
The exact mechanism by which an increased adherence to the traditional 
Mediterranean diet exerts its favorable effects is not known. However, 
accumulating evidence indicates that the five most important adaptations induced 
by the Mediterranean dietary pattern are: (a) lipid-lowering effect, (b) 
protection against oxidative stress, inflammation and platelet aggregation, (c) 
modification of hormones and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of 
cancer, (d) inhibition of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid 
restriction, and (e) gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites 
influencing metabolic health. More studies are needed to understand how single 
modifications of nutrients typical of the Mediterranean diet interact with 
energy intake, energy expenditure, and the microbiome in modulating the key 
mechanisms that promote cellular, tissue, and organ health during aging.

OBJECTIVES: National health insurance is now common in most developed countries. 
This study reviews the evidence and synthesizes the cost-effectiveness 
information for national health insurance or disability insurance programs 
across high-income countries.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search using health, economics and systematic review 
electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline, Econlit, RepEc, Cochrane library 
and Campbell library), was conducted from April to October 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently selected relevant studies by 
applying screening criteria to the title and keywords fields, followed by a 
detailed examination of abstracts.
DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected for data extraction using a quality 
assessment form consisting of five questions. Only studies with positive answers 
to all five screening questions were selected for data extraction. Data were 
entered into a data extraction form by one reviewer and verified by another.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Data on costs and quality of life in control and treatment 
groups were used to draw distributions for synthesis. We chose the log-normal 
distribution for both cost and quality-of-life data to reflect non-negative 
value and high skew. The results were synthesized using a Monte Carlo 
simulation, with 10,000 repetitions, to estimate the overall cost-effectiveness 
of national health insurance programs.
RESULTS: Four studies from the United States that examined the 
cost-effectiveness of national health insurance were included in the review. One 
study examined the effects of medical expenditure, and the remaining studies 
examined the cost-effectiveness of health insurance reforms. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from US$23,000 to US$64,000 per QALY. The 
combined results showed that national health insurance is associated with an 
average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$51,300 per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY). Based on the standard threshold for cost-effectiveness, 
national insurance programs are cost-effective interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Although national health insurance programs have been introduced in 
most developed countries, only a few studies have examined their 
cost-effectiveness. All the selected studies revealed strong evidence to support 
health insurance programs or health reforms in the United States. The average 
ICER in this study is below the standard threshold for cost-effectiveness used 
in the US. The small number of relevant studies is the main limitation of this 
study.

OBJECTIVE: Cancer and its treatment in childhood and young adulthood can cause 
hypogonadism, leading to increased risk of long-term morbidity and mortality. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of presenting with biochemical 
signs of hypogonadism in testicular cancer survivors (TCS) and male childhood 
cancer survivors (CCS) in relation to the type of treatment given.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
PATIENTS: Ninety-two TCS, 125 CCS (mean age 40 and median age 34 years, 
respectively; mean follow-up time 9.2 and 24 years, respectively) and a 
corresponding number of age-matched controls.
MEASUREMENTS: Fasting morning blood samples were analysed for total testosterone 
(TT), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The odds 
ratios (OR) for hypogonadism, defined as primary, secondary, compensated or 
ongoing androgen replacement, were calculated for TCS and CCS and for subgroups 
defined by diagnosis and treatment.
RESULTS: Hypogonadism was found in 26% of CCS and 36% of TCS, respectively (OR: 
2.1, P = .025 and OR = 2.3, P = .021). Among CCS, the OR was further increased 
in those given testicular irradiation (OR = 28, P = .004). Radiotherapy other 
than cranial or testicular irradiation plus chemotherapy, or cranial irradiation 
without chemotherapy, associated also with increased ORs (OR = 3.7, P = .013, 
and OR = 4.4, P = .038, respectively). Among TCS, those receiving >4 cycles of 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy had OR = 17, P = .015.
CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical signs of testosterone deficiency are recognized as 
markers of decreased life expectancy. Thus, the risk of hypogonadism in TCS and 
CCS should be recognized and emphasizes the need of long-term follow-up for 
these men.

Metachronous double primary cancer of epithelial and mesenchymal origins: A case 
report of a rare clinical phenomenon.

Hospital and Hebei Provincial Tumor Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, PR China 
Department of Emergency, Hebei Medical University Second Affiliated Hospital, 
Shijiazhuang, Hebei, PR China.

RATIONALE: Metachronous double primary cancers from the same origin have 
previously been reported in several studies; however, the occurrence of double 
primary cancers from different tissue origins has not been reported earlier.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We analyzed 10 patients with requirement surgical treatment.
DIAGNOSES: After over 6 months of the surgery, histopathological examination 
confirmed the presence of at least two neoplastic lesions with distinct 
histopathology at different locations.
INTERVENTIONS: These patients underwent surgery and the hematoxylin and eosin 
staining was performed according to standard protocol in all cases.
OUTCOMES: Since the occurrence of multiple primary cancers is an extremely rare 
event, it is difficult to find a large sample size of patients with double 
primary cancers at one study center. All patients included in this study 
received surgical therapy twice and had a final tissue histopathologic 
diagnosis.
LESSONS: Based on our findings, it is concluded that a prolonged follow-up 
examination for cancer patients should be taken into consideration to provide 
early detection of secondary tumors and improve overall life expectancy of these 
patients. Furthermore, clinicians should be well aware of the possibility of 
cancer patients developing a second primary cancer of a different tissue origin.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol is associated with adverse health effects causing a 
considerable economic impact to society. A reliable estimate of this economic 
impact for Belgium is lacking. This is the aim of the study.
METHODS: A prevalence-based approach estimating the direct, indirect and 
intangible costs for the year 2012 was used. Attributional fractions for a 
series of health effects were derived from literature. The human capital 
approach was used to estimate indirect costs, while the concept of 
disability-adjusted life years was used to estimate intangible costs. 
Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty 
around cost estimates and to evaluate the impact of alternative modelling 
assumptions.
RESULTS: In 2012, total alcohol-attributable direct costs were estimated at 
€906.1 million, of which the majority were due to hospitalization (€743.7 
million, 82%). The indirect costs amounted to €642.6 million, of which 62% was 
caused by premature mortality. Alcohol was responsible for 157,500 
disability-adjusted life years representing €6.3 billion intangible costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a number of limitations intrinsic to this kind of research, 
the study can be considered as the most comprehensive analysis thus far of the 
health-related social costs of alcohol in Belgium.

The long blood circulatory property of human serum albumin, due to engagement 
with the cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), is an attractive drug 
half-life extension enabling technology. This work describes a novel 
site-specific albumin double-stranded (ds) DNA assembly approach, in which the 
3' or 5' end maleimide-derivatized oligodeoxynucleotides are conjugated to 
albumin cysteine at position 34 (cys34) and annealed with complementary strands 
to allow single site-specific protein modification with functionalized ds 
oligodeoxynucleotides. Electrophoretic gel shift assays demonstrated successful 
annealing of complementary strands bearing Atto488, 6-carboxyfluorescein 
(6-FAM), or a factor IXa aptamer to the albumin-oligodeoxynucleotide conjugate. 
A fluorometric factor IXa activity assay showed retained aptamer inhibitory 
activity upon assembly with the albumin and completely blocked factor IXa at a 
concentration of 100 nM for 2 hr. The assembled construct exhibited stability in 
serum-containing buffer and FcRn engagement that could be increased using an 
albumin variant engineered for higher FcRn affinity. This work presents a novel 
albumin-oligodeoxynucleotide assembly technology platform that offers potential 
combinatorial drug delivery and half-life extension applications.
