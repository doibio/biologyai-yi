Germany, which is primarily due to the restricted quantity and quality of 
existing data. The official migrant death statistics for Germany suffer from 
incomplete migrant population stock data due to non-registered remigration 
events. After the German census in 2011 especially the migrant stock data was 
adjusted downwards, and therefore realistic estimates of the migrant mortality 
risk and the healthy-migrant-effect are possible. Between 2010 and 2013 
mortality risks of foreigners rose strongly due to the census corrections of the 
migrant population. However, the risks for adults and pensioners still lie below 
the risks for Germans in the same age groups. The lower risks indicate a 
healthy-migrant-effect, whicht was primarily effective shortly after the 
immigration event. Analysis based on data from the Statutory Pension Insurance 
(GRV) shows higher migrant mortality risks in the age group from 65 to 84. In 
that age group there are supposedly a lot of people, who immigrated to Germany 
in the context of the guest worker recruitment in the 1950s to 1970s and who had 
hard working conditions in their lifetimes. Their mortality risk, therefore, 
increased in the long-term perspective. In the future the lack of data in the 
migrant population will again rise due to unregistered remigration. Alternative 
databases need to be used for migrant mortality analyses.

INTRODUCTION: Apart from its medical dimension, the current problem with obesity 
has acquired social urgency. This serious lifestyle disease has a negative 
impact on a number of life processes in the body, causing distortions and 
damaging different structures. It also contributes to clinical complications, 
lowers the quality of life and reduces life expectancy. Apart from 
health-related consequences, it can bring such unfavourable results as social, 
mental and emotional disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of relevant epidemiological studies on 
obesity in Poland relative to selected countries in Europe and the world over 
the past 15 years was conducted. Also an attempt was made at forecasting the 
development of the obesity problem.
RESULTS: The analysed results demonstrated that the percentage of obese people 
among the adult population of Poland was on the rise in the period under 
investigation. Taking into account the estimated growth rate, we can assume that 
the percentage of obese people in Poland right now might total 23.7% for men and 
23.3% for women. If no changes are introduced in this respect, in 2020 we can 
expect a rise to, respectively, 30.3% and 27.3%, and in 2030 to 37% for men and 
31.4% for women.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the percentage of obese people among the adult 
population in Poland is most likely connected with a positive energy balance. In 
comparison to other European countries Poland has the highest percentage of 
obese men and women.

INTRODUCTION: Opioid treatment for chronic pain is a known risk factor for falls 
and/or fractures in elderly patients. The latter cause a significant cost to the 
National Health Service and the Personal Social Services in the UK. Tramadol has 
a higher risk of fractures than some other opioid analgesics used to treat 
moderate-to-severe pain and, in the model described here, we investigate the 
cost effectiveness of transdermal buprenorphine treatment compared with tramadol 
in a high-risk population.
METHODS: A model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of tramadol 
compared with transdermal buprenorphine over a 1-year time horizon and a patient 
population of high-risk patients (female patients age 75 or older). To estimate 
the total cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of treatment, published 
odds ratios are used in combination with the published incidence rates of four 
types of fracture: hip, wrist, humerus and other.
RESULTS: The model shows tramadol to be associated with 1,058 more fractures per 
100,000 patients per year compared with transdermal buprenorphine, resulting in 
transdermal buprenorphine being cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of less than £7,000 compared with tramadol. Sensitivity 
analysis found this result to be robust.
LIMITATIONS: In the UK data, there is uncertainty regarding the transdermal 
buprenorphine odds ratios for fractures. Odds ratios published in Danish and 
Swedish studies show similar point estimates but are associated with less 
uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: Transdermal buprenorphine is cost-effective compared to tramadol at 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY.

OBJECTIVES: To validate the 'Quality of Life with Implant-Prostheses (QoLIP-10)' 
questionnaire for assessing the impact of cemented implant prostheses on Oral 
Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL).
METHODS: 84 subjects wearing implant restorations were distributed as follows: 
Group 1 (SD-I; n=35): screwed FDPs (fixed dental prostheses) supported by 2 
implants; Group 2 (SD-II; n=7): screwed FDPs supported by 3-5 implants; Group 3 
(CD-I; n=36): cemented FDPs supported by 2 implants; and Group 4 (CD-II; n=6): 
cemented FDPs supported by 3-5 implants. The QoLIP-10 and the Oral Health Impact 
Profile (OHIP-14sp) scales were used. Data related to global oral satisfaction, 
socio-demographics, health-behaviors, and prostheses, were gathered. Reliability 
and validity of the QoLIP-10 were investigated. Correlations between both 
indices were explored with the Spearman's rank test. Descriptive and 
non-parametric probes were run to evaluate the effect of the study variables on 
the OHRQoL (α=0.05).
RESULTS: The QoLIP-10 confirmed its psychometric capacity for cemented implant 
prosthesis wearers. Both tests were inversely correlated. The QoLIP-10 
attributed the significantly worst QoL to long-span cemented prostheses. Groups 
were significantly discriminated by the QoLIP-10 performance dimension. The 
variable complaints about the mouth and the three global oral satisfaction 
measures significantly modulated the OHRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction depends upon the extension and the type of 
retention of implant FDPs.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The QoLIP-10 may help estimating the effect of cemented 
FDPs on patients' well-being. When compared to screwed FDPs, short cemented 
implant restorations lead to greater improvements in patients' self-perceived 
QoL.

Due to the increased utilization of cross-sectional imaging and prolonged life 
expectancy, the incidence of incidentally diagnosed renal tumors continues to 
rise. While partial nephrectomy is currently recommended as the gold standard 
treatment of cT1a small renal mass whenever technically feasible, the perceived 
benefits of partial nephrectomy may not be applicable to all patient groups. 
Selecting between treatment options in elderly and the infirm can present a 
significant challenge. Informed and thoughtful small renal mass management 
decisions require consideration and balance of patient, tumor, and procedural 
risks to maintain oncological efficacy while minimizing treatment associated 
morbidity. Herein we review the comparative effectiveness of partial versus 
radical nephrectomy in the elderly and the role of standardized tools to 
quantify risk.

BACKGROUND: It is essential to reach glycaemic control in patients with diabetes 
mellitus to prevent reduced life expectancy and morbidity related to 
complications. The aim of this study was to determine whether glycaemic control 
is associated with the perception of illness in type II diabetes mellitus.
METHODOLOGY: Illness perception was assessed in a sample of 242 diabetics 
attending a Family Health Centre in Chile using the Brief Illness Perception 
Questionnaire (BIPQ). We considered well-controlled individuals to have glycated 
haemoglobin below 7%, and we assessed association with the BIPQ score. The data 
were analysed by logistic regression.
RESULTS: The total BIPQ score was significantly higher (more negative 
perception) in non-controlled individuals; the most significant differences were 
found in the following dimensions: consequences (p=0.0003), personal control 
(p=0.0392), identity (p=0.0006) and emotional affection (p=0.018). The 
dimensions of timeline, treatment control, concern and coherence showed no 
differences between the groups. The mean age of well-controlled subjects was 
significantly higher than the age of non-controlled diabetics. Well-controlled 
patients had been diagnosed with diabetes for significantly fewer years than had 
those that were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceiving illness as more negative (BIPQ score >37) is highly 
associated with being a non-controlled diabetic, with more consequences over 
their daily life, less control over the disease and a higher number of 
attributable symptoms. When control variables are considered, a negative 
perception of diabetes has an adjusted OR of 2.14 (CI 95% 1.17-3.92) to have 
glycated haemoglobin above 7%.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding delamanid (Deltyba™) to a 
background regimen (BR) for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) 
in Germany.
METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a cohort of MDR-TB 
patients, 38-years old on average, with Deltyba™ plus BR versus a five drug- BR 
regimen alone was compared in a Markov model over a period of 10 years. Cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were 
determined from a societal perspective. Recent data from a German cost 
calculation on MDR-TB were applied to the 24-month outcome results of patients 
participating in the placebo-controlled, phase II Otsuka's Trial 204. Costs and 
effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% and subjected to deterministic as 
well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Based on the current market prices the total discounted cost per 
patient on BR plus Deltyba™ was €142,732 compared to €150,909 for BR alone. The 
total discounted QALYs per patient were 8.47 for Deltyba™ versus 6.13 for BR 
alone. Accordingly, the addition of Deltyba™ proved to be dominant over the BR 
alone-strategy by simultaneously saving €8177 and gaining 2.34 QALYs. Deltyba™ 
was cost saving in 73% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses compared to BR 
alone and 100% cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
€10,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Under conditions prevalent in Germany, Deltyba™ added to a five 
drug BR regimen is likely to be cost-saving compared to BR alone under a wide 
range of assumptions. Adding delamanid remained cost-effective when costs due to 
loss of productivity were excluded as the QALYs gained by lower lethality and a 
higher proportion of successfully treated patients outweighed the delamanid drug 
costs. These results strongly support the application of Deltyba™ in treating 
MDR-TB patients.

OBJECTIVES: Studies report that the risks of significant neurologic 
complications (including stroke, cerebral abscess, and migraine) and hemorrhagic 
sequelae are high in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), 
and that life expectancy in this cohort is reduced. However, most published 
cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias.
METHODS: We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing 
neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis 
of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also 
long-term survival of those with the disease.
RESULTS: From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health 
Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and 
compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care 
practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 
1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis 
(OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) 
were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than 
controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at 
death 3 years younger.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious 
neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of 
HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who 
have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is 
required.

Effectiveness of the food recovery at the retailing stage under shelf life 
uncertainty: An application to Italian food chains.

Muriana C(1).

Food losses represent a significant issue affecting food supply chains. The 
possibility of recovering such products can be seen as an effective way to 
reduce such a phenomenon, improve supply chain performances and ameliorate the 
conditions of undernourished people. The topic has been already investigated by 
a previous paper enforcing the hypothesis of deterministic and constant Shelf 
Life (SL) of products. However, such a model cannot be properly extended to 
products affected by uncertainties of the SL as it does not take into account 
the deterioration costs and loss of profits due to the overcoming of the SL 
within the cycle time. Thus the present paper presents an extension of the 
previous one under stochastic conditions of the food quality. Differently from 
the previous publication, this work represents a general model applicable to all 
supply chains, especially to those managing fresh products characterized by 
uncertain SL such as fruits and vegetables. The deterioration costs and loss of 
profits are included in the model and the optimal time at which to withdraw the 
products from the shelves as well as the quantities to be shipped at each 
alternative destination have been determined. A comparison of the proposed model 
with that reported in the previous publication has been carried out in order to 
underline the impact of the SL variability on the optimality conditions. The 
results show that the food recovery strategy in the presence of uncertainty of 
the food quality is rewarding, even if the optimal profit is lower than that of 
the deterministic case.

Migration, pastoralists, HIV infection and access to care: the nomadic Fulani of 
northern Nigeria.

Habib AG, Jumare J.

The burden of HIV infection among the nomadic Fulani of northern Nigeria is 
unknown. Migration - a way of life for this population - is known to increase 
the rate of HIV transmission and may limit individuals' access to treatment and 
care. Many of Africa's other traditional, pastoral societies are similarly 
affected. This paper explores cultural practices and factors among the Fulani 
that may influence HIV transmission, vulnerability to infection, sustainability 
and challenges to treatment access, and avenues and models for outreach 
services; lastly, we proffer some solutions and recommendations. An extensive 
literature search with cross-referencing was done, and relevant publications on 
similar themes were reviewed. Three cases of Fulani nomads with HIV are 
presented to illustrate the challenge of providing a care continuum as well as 
to demonstrate successes when appropriate HIV interventions are employed. 
Patient interviews provide valuable insight and information on living and coping 
with HIV. Community mobility limits opportunities for counselling, testing and 
diagnosis, as well as HIV-related care access and maintenance. Consanguinity and 
certain cultural practices among the Fulani have clear amplification potential 
for HIV transmission. Treatment support through the use of coaches and life 
partners improves adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Existing programmes 
for nomads afford opportunities for absorption and integration of HIV services. 
Nomadic communities should be provided with basic HIV-related services, 
including risk-reduction education and methods, counselling and testing, ART, 
medication adherence counselling, access to laboratory tests and health 
monitoring. These services should be taken to nomadic communities using novel 
approaches such as mobile units, extension services, case management, directly 
observed care, and treatment supporters linked to neighbouring health facilities 
in a hub-and-spoke model. Stronger collaborations are recommended between 
programmes for nomads and HIV services, and also between veterinary and public 
health services. Community participation and leadership should be encouraged to 
ensure the sustainability of HIV-related care delivery. More research is needed 
on the epidemiology and sociology of HIV infection and the best ways to provide 
services to hard-to-reach nomadic populations.

BACKGROUND: Life events are an established risk factor for the onset and 
recurrence of unipolar and bipolar mood episodes, especially in the presence of 
genetic vulnerability. The dynamic interplay between life events and 
psychological context, however, is less studied. In this study, we investigated 
the impact of life events on the onset and recurrence of mood episodes in 
bipolar offspring, as well as the effects of temperament, coping and parenting 
style on this association.
METHOD: Bipolar offspring (n = 108) were followed longitudinally from 
adolescence to adulthood. Mood disorders were assessed with: the Kiddie Schedule 
of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Present and Lifetime Version or the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders; life events with the 
Life Events and Difficulties Schedule; and psychological measures using the 
Utrecht Coping List, Temperament and Character Inventory and short-EMBU 
(memories of upbringing instrument). Anderson-Gill models (an extension of the 
Cox proportional hazard model) were utilized.
RESULTS: Life events were associated with an increased risk for first and, 
although less pronounced, subsequent mood episodes. There was a large 
confounding effect for the number of previous mood episodes; findings suggest a 
possible kindling effect. Passive coping style increased the risk of mood 
episode onset and recurrent episodes, but also altered the effect of life events 
on mood disorders. Harm avoidance temperament was associated with mood episode 
recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Life events are especially a risk factor in the onset of mood 
disorders, though less so in recurrent episodes. Psychological features (passive 
coping and harm-avoidant temperament) contribute to the risk of an episode 
occurring, and also have a moderating effect on the association between life 
events and mood episodes. These findings create potential early intervention 
strategies for bipolar offspring.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a chronic and life-threatening disease that 
is initially supported by muscle regeneration but eventually shows satellite 
cell exhaustion and muscular dysfunction. The life-long maintenance of skeletal 
muscle homoeostasis requires the satellite stem cell pool to be preserved. 
Asymmetric cell division plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the 
satellite cell pool. Here we show that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
receptor (G-CSFR) is asymmetrically expressed in activated satellite cells. 
G-CSF positively affects the satellite cell population during multiple stages of 
differentiation in ex vivo cultured fibres. G-CSF could be important in 
developing an effective therapy for DMD based on its potential to modulate the 
supply of multiple stages of regenerated myocytes. This study shows that the 
G-CSF-G-CSFR axis is fundamentally important for long-term muscle regeneration, 
functional maintenance and lifespan extension in mouse models of DMD with 
varying severities.

Containment and contagion: How to strengthen families to support youth HIV

There has been little research done in South Africa that investigates how 
families nested within communities can be strengthened to support the prevention 
of HIV infection in youth. A focused ethnographic case-study approach was 
employed to better understand how families in a semi-rural area outside Durban, 
South Africa, could support youth to make healthy life choices, particularly 
with respect to HIV risk behaviour. This involved a volunteer convenience sample 
of parents or caregivers and key community members. A psychodynamic extension of 
social representational theory was applied to an interpretation of the data. The 
findings suggest that caregivers of youth feel disempowered and unsupported in a 
context of fractured and un-containing leadership structures, which works 
against social cohesion. In the context of social change and relatively new and 
threatening phenomena such as HIV/AIDS, we argue that strong unified leadership 
structures are necessary to assist with anchoring the unfamiliar and rendering 
it manageable, as well as to form the building blocks of social cohesion, a 
protective social environmental factor for youth. In addition, we suggest that 
programmes aimed at empowering parents or caregivers with knowledge about 
HIV/AIDS as well as renegotiating parental practices to promote greater parental 
authority, would be important interventions at a family level.

We estimated the cost of Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years gained according to 
preoperative disease severity. We studied 159 primary unilateral THA, mean 
follow-up: 4 years. A median split of preoperative WOMAC scores was done to set 
apart a low (better) and a high (worse) score group. The groups with worse 
preoperative WOMAC were consistently associated with a less cost-effective 
intervention. The highest mean cost-effectiveness was achieved by patients with 
better WOMAC-total ($8256.32/QALY-gained). As patients aged, the 
cost-effectiveness of THA decreased. Patients 75 years of age or older and with 
worse scores had the least cost-effective interventions 
($25,937.33/QALY-gained). THA remains a very cost-effective intervention even 
when performed in older "sicker" patients. Waiting for the patient to 
deteriorate will make the intervention more "expensive".

Advancing age is associated with a progressive loss of skeletal muscle (SkM) 
mass and function. Given the worldwide aging demographics, this is a major 
contributor to morbidity, escalating socio-economic costs and ultimately 
mortality. Previously, it has been established that a decrease in regenerative 
capacity in addition to SkM loss with age coincides with suppression of 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathways. However, genetic or 
pharmacological modulations of these highly conserved pathways have been 
observed to significantly enhance life and healthspan in various species, 
including mammals. This therefore provides a controversial paradigm in which 
reduced regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle tissue with age potentially 
promotes longevity of the organism. This paradox will be assessed and considered 
in the light of the following: (i) the genetic knockout, overexpression and 
pharmacological models that induce lifespan extension (e.g. IRS-1/s6K KO, mTOR 
inhibition) versus the important role of these signalling pathways in SkM growth 
and adaptation; (ii) the role of the sirtuins (SIRTs) in longevity versus their 
emerging role in SkM regeneration and survival under catabolic stress; (iii) the 
role of dietary restriction and its impact on longevity versus skeletal muscle 
mass regulation; (iv) the crosstalk between cellular energy metabolism 
(AMPK/TSC2/SIRT1) and survival (FOXO) versus growth and repair of SkM (e.g. AMPK 
vs. mTOR); and (v) the impact of protein feeding in combination with dietary 
restriction will be discussed as a potential intervention to maintain SkM mass 
while increasing longevity and enabling healthy aging.

In polygynous primates, a greater reproductive variance in males have been 
linked to their reduced life expectancy relative to females. The mortality 
patterns of monogamous pair-bonded primates, however, are less clear. We 
analyzed the sex differences in mortality within wild (NMales  = 70, NFemales 
 = 73) and captive (NMales  = 25, NFemales  = 29) populations of Azara's owl 
monkeys (Aotus azarae), a socially and genetically monogamous primate exhibiting 
biparental care. We used Bayesian Survival Trajectory Analysis (BaSTA) to test 
age-dependent models of mortality. The wild and captive populations were best 
fit by the logistic and Gompertz models, respectively, implying greater 
heterogeneity in the wild environment likely due to harsher conditions. We found 
that age patterns of mortality were similar between the sexes in both 
populations. We calculated life expectancy and disparity, the latter a measure 
of the steepness of senescence, for both sexes in each population. Males and 
females had similar life expectancies in both populations; the wild population 
overall having a shorter life expectancy than the captive one. Furthermore, 
captive females had a reduced life disparity relative to captive males and to 
both sexes in the wild. We interpret this pattern in light of the hazards 
associated with reproduction. In captivity, where reproduction is intensely 
managed, the risks associated with gestation and birth are tempered so that 
there is a reduction in the likelihood of captive females dying prematurely, 
decreasing their overall life disparity.

Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are progressive diseases of human heart and 
skeletal muscle with a severe impact on life quality and expectancy of affected 
patients. Although recently several disease genes for myofibrillar myopathies 
could be identified, today most genetic causes and particularly the associated 
mechanisms and signaling events that lead from the mutation to the disease 
phenotype are still mostly unknown. To assess whether the zebrafish is a 
suitable model system to validate MFM candidate genes using targeted 
antisense-mediated knock-down strategies, we here specifically inactivated known 
human MFM disease genes and evaluated the resulting muscular and cardiac 
phenotypes functionally and structurally. Consistently, targeted ablation of MFM 
genes in zebrafish led to compromised skeletal muscle function mostly due to 
myofibrillar degeneration as well as severe heart failure. Similar to what was 
shown in MFM patients, MFM gene-deficient zebrafish showed pronounced 
gene-specific phenotypic and structural differences. In summary, our results 
indicate that the zebrafish is a suitable model to functionally and structurally 
evaluate novel MFM disease genes in vivo.

provenance of nutrients.

The presence of one of the largest colonies of House Martins in Europe on the 
small island of Stora Karlsö, Sweden, led us to investigate the source of their 
food by analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Carbon isotopic 
values of House Martin nestlings were the same as those of Common Guillemot Uria 
aalge nestlings fed on marine fish, but differed from local Collared Flycatcher 
Ficedula albicollis nestlings fed on woodland insects. We infer that these House 
Martins fed their chicks almost exclusively on insects that had used nutrients 
derived from seabirds, indicating a dependence on the presence of a large 
seabird colony. We suggest by extension that some populations of island 
passerines of high conservation importance may also be dependent on nutrient 
subsidies from seabird colonies.

the current surgical treatment of early stage breast cancer.

Oncology, Bucharest, Romania.

The identification and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node has become a standard 
method of treatment for stage I and II breast cancer in the last decades, taking 
into account the fact that the management of the axilla in patients with breast 
cancer has evolved from the routine lymphadenectomy to a selective attitude, 
based on the histopathological evaluation of the sentinel lymph node, as well as 
on the tumor and on the patients' characteristics. Since the introduction of the 
method into clinical practice, in 1994, different methods of identification have 
been used (radioisotope injection, vital blue dye, or, more recently, lipophilic 
contrast agent for ultrasound visualization or paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) 
or the method of indocyanine green fluorescence), each presenting certain 
limits, but the radioisotopic method proving the most accurate. Moreover, during 
the development of the method, beside the standard indications specific for T1 
or T2 breast tumor, without clinical or imagistic axillary adenopathies, their 
extension to a series of other particular situations such as the following, has 
been tried: ductal carcinoma in situ, multicentre tumors, after excisional 
biopsy or tumors preoperatively treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of 
the paper is to present the progress made regarding the current stage in the use 
of sentinel lymph node technique in breast cancer, while mentioning the 
established indications, as well as the ones that are still debating and need 
further studies. Likewise, the cases in which the axillary lymph node dissection 
remains the major indication for treatment of the axilla, in patients with early 
stage breast cancer, will be discussed.

Endoscopic palliation of advanced esophageal cancer.

(1)Surgery Clinic, "Sf. Maria" Clinical Hospital, Bucharest , Romania.

Esophageal cancer represents one of the most aggressive digestive tumors, with a 
survival rate at 5 years of only 10%. Globally, during the last three decades, 
there has been an increasing incidence of the esophageal cancer, approx. 400,000 
new esophageal cancers being currently diagnosed annually. This represents the 
eighth leading cause of cancer incidence and the sixth leading cause of cancer 
death overall. Taking into account the population's global aging and thus, the 
increase in the number of patients who will not bear surgery, PCT and radiation, 
or the fact that they do not want it especially because of deficiencies and 
associated pathology, the endoscopic ablative techniques with palliation 
purposes represent the alternative. If we refer to the Western Europe countries 
and North America, we notice an increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma rate 
versus squamous cancer. As for the Asian region, referring in particular to 
China and Japan, 9 out of 10 esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. 
For at least half of the patients with EC (esophageal cancer) there is no hope 
of healing because of the advanced regional malignant invasion (T3-4, N+, M+) 
with no chemo and radiotherapy response, poor preoperative patients' conditions 
or systemic metastasis. The low life expectancy does not justify the risky 
medical procedures, the goal of the therapy consisting in the improvement of the 
quality of life by eliminating dysphagia (reestablishing oral feeding) which 
represents the most common complication of EC, the respiratory tract 
complication caused by eso-tracheal fistulas or by eliminating chest pain. To 
treat dysphagia, which is the main target of palliation, combined methods like 
endoscopic, chemo and radio-therapy, can be used, each one with indications, 
benefits and risks.

Risk and manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients infected 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will continue to evolve as improved 
treatments and life expectancy of these patients increases. Although initiation 
of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has been shown to reduce this risk, some ARV 
medications may induce metabolic abnormalities, further compounding the risk of 
CVD. In this patient population, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic 
strategies should be employed to treat and reduce further risk of CVD. This 
review summarizes epidemiology data of the risk factors and development of CVD 
in HIV and provides recommendations to manage CVD in HIV-infected patients.

BACKGROUND: Patients in the final stages of renal failure have accelerated 
inflammation conditions. Inflammation causes progressive kidney damage, faster 
progression of atherogenesis, chronic malnutrition and increased anemia, 
resulting in lower life expectancy of patients under dialysis. Statins have 
pleiotropic effects, because the drug has effects more than just decreasing 
lipids such as antioxidant effects, changes in endothelial dysfunction, 
stabilizing the plaque and immune system regulator.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory effect of 
simvastatin (one of the statins) in patients under hemodialysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial study, 40 patients under 
hemodialysis were studied for 12 weeks. Patients were divided into treatment (25 
cases) and control groups (15 cases). The treatment group received a daily 
dosage of 20 mg of simvastatin, while the control group received no medication. 
The serum amounts of hs-CRP, IL6, Hb and WBC count were measured and compared at 
baseline and after 12 weeks. In addition, probable hepatic and muscular 
complications were studied in patients.
RESULTS: At baseline, each of treatment and control groups had similar 
characteristics. During the study, the average level of CRP decreased in the 
treatment group (P = 0.04), while it was increased in the control group. The 
amount of serum IL-6 dropped in the treatment group (P = 0.01); however, it was 
increased in the control group. In both groups, the level of Hb increased 
significantly at the end of study in the treatment group (P = 0.007) and the 
control group (P = 0.016). The average WBC count decreased significantly in the 
treatment group and the control group (P = 0.003). There was no significant 
change in hepatic and muscular enzymes in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: End stage renal disease (ESRD) have accelerated inflammatory 
conditions. Simvastatin clearly lowers the serum levels of CRP and IL-6, and the 
white blood cell count in dialysis patients. Administering Simvastatin to 
dialysis patients is safe.

Around the world, and in spite of their higher life expectancy, women tend to 
report worse health than men until old age. Explanations for this gender gap in 
self-perceived health may be different in China than in other countries due to 
the traditional phenomenon of son preference. We examine several possible 
reasons for the gap using the Chinese SAGE data. We first rule out differential 
reporting by gender as a possible explanation, exploiting information on 
anchoring vignettes in eight domains of health functioning. Decomposing the gap 
in general self-assessed health, we find that about 31% can be explained by 
socio-demographic factors, most of all by discrimination against women in 
education in the 20th century. A more complete specification including chronic 
conditions and health functioning fully explains the remainder of the gap (about 
69%). Adding chronic conditions and health functioning also explains at least 
two thirds of the education contribution, suggesting how education may affect 
health. In particular, women's higher rates of arthritis, angina and eye 
diseases make the largest contributions to the gender health gap, by limiting 
mobility, increasing pain and discomfort, and causing sleep problems and a 
feeling of low energy.

Can memory be retained after cryopreservation? Our research has attempted to 
answer this long-standing question by using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis 
elegans, a well-known model organism for biological research that has generated 
revolutionary findings but has not been tested for memory retention after 
cryopreservation. Our study's goal was to test C. elegans' memory recall after 
vitrification and reviving. Using a method of sensory imprinting in the young C. 
elegans, we establish that learning acquired through olfactory cues shapes the 
animal's behavior and the learning is retained at the adult stage after 
vitrification. Our research method included olfactory imprinting with the 
chemical benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) for phase-sense olfactory imprinting at the L1 
stage, the fast-cooling SafeSpeed method for vitrification at the L2 stage, 
reviving, and a chemotaxis assay for testing memory retention of learning at the 
adult stage. Our results in testing memory retention after cryopreservation show 
that the mechanisms that regulate the odorant imprinting (a form of long-term 
memory) in C. elegans have not been modified by the process of vitrification or 
by slow freezing.
