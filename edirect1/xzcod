processing and their elimination by autophagy activation. Likewise, certain 
nutrients can modulate the inflammatory response and the oxidative stress 
related to the disease. However, the extent to which these effects come with 
beneficial clinical outcomes remains unclear. Even so, several studies have 
shown the benefits of the Mediterranean diet on Alzheimer's disease, due to its 
richness in many of these compounds, to which can be attributed their 
neuroprotective properties due to the pleiotropic effect they show on the 
aforementioned processes. These indications highlight the potential role of 
adequate dietary recommendations for clinical management of both Alzheimer's 
diagnosed patients and those in risk of developing it, emphasising once again 
the importance of diet on health.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases and is 
associated with a reduced life expectancy and acute and chronic complications, 
including frequent painful vaso-occlusive episodes that often require 
hospitalization. At present, treatment of SCD is limited to hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant, transfusion, and limited options for pharmacotherapy, based 
principally on hydroxyurea therapy. This review highlights the importance of 
intracellular cGMP-dependent signaling pathways in SCD pathophysiology; 
modulation of these pathways with soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators or 
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors could potentially provide vasorelaxation and 
anti-inflammatory effects, as well as elevate levels of anti-sickling fetal 
hemoglobin.

BACKGROUND: Within cancer care, dynamic evaluations of the loss in expectation 
of life provides useful information to patients as well as physicians. The loss 
of lifetime function yields the conditional loss in expectation of life given 
survival up to a specific time point. Due to the inevitable censoring in 
time-to-event data, loss of lifetime estimation requires extrapolation of both 
the patient and general population survival function. In this context, the 
accuracy of different extrapolation approaches has not previously been 
evaluated.
METHODS: The loss of lifetime function was computed by decomposing the all-cause 
survival function using the relative and general population survival function. 
To allow extrapolation, the relative survival function was fitted using existing 
parametric relative survival models. In addition, we introduced a novel mixture 
cure model suitable for extrapolation. The accuracy of the estimated loss of 
lifetime function using various extrapolation approaches was assessed in a 
simulation study and by data from the Danish Cancer Registry where complete 
follow-up was available. In addition, we illustrated the proposed methodology by 
analyzing recent data from the Danish Lymphoma Registry.
RESULTS: No uniformly superior extrapolation method was found, but flexible 
parametric mixture cure models and flexible parametric relative survival models 
seemed to be suitable in various scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Using extrapolation to estimate the loss of lifetime function 
requires careful consideration of the relative survival function outside the 
available follow-up period. We propose extensive sensitivity analyses when 
estimating the loss of lifetime function.

Anderson-Fabry disease is a severe progressive multisystem condition of genetic 
origin that affects men and women, reducing their life expectancy and quality of 
life. The considerable variability in its clinical expression, the difficulties 
in diagnosing the condition and the current availability of several alternatives 
for its treatment represent a considerable challenge that justifies the 
development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines that can help health 
professionals in the decision-making process for managing these patients. To 
develop these guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of the main reference 
databases using strategies adapted to each of the 32 clinical questions 
considered. We prepared documents to synthesise the evidence and assess its 
quality for each of the questions. The methodology employed is based on the 
Spanish methodology manual for preparing clinical practice guidelines, 
incorporating the GRADE methodology in the assessment of the scientific evidence 
and the preparation of the recommendations, considering the quality of the 
evidence, the risk-benefit balance, patient values and preferences, equity and 
use of resources. For the definitive preparation of the recommendations, we 
conducted a structured consensus process based on the Delphi-RAND methodology in 
2 rounds, with an expert panel proposed by various scientific societies, 
research centres and patient associations. Ultimately, we developed 92 specific 
recommendations for managing Fabry disease.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended as the primary test in cervical cancer 
screening, with co-testing by cytology for HPV-positive women to identify 
cervical lesions. Cytology has low sensitivity and there is a need to identify 
biomarkers that could identify dysplasia that are likely to progress to cancer. 
We searched for plasma proteins that could identify women with cervical cancer 
using the multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA). The abundance of 100 
proteins were measured in plasma collected at the time of diagnosis of patients 
with invasive cervical cancer and in population controls using the Olink 
Multiplex panels CVD II, INF I, and ONC II. Eighty proteins showed increased 
levels in cases compared with controls. We identified a signature of 11 proteins 
(PTX3, ITGB1BP2, AXIN1, STAMPB, SRC, SIRT2, 4E-BP1, PAPPA, HB-EGF, NEMO and 
IL27) that distinguished cases and controls with a sensitivity of 0.96 at a 
specificity of 1.0. This signature was evaluated in a prospective replication 
cohort with samples collected before, at or after diagnosis and achieved a 
sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity 0.56 separating samples collected at the 
time of diagnosis of invasive cancer from samples collected prior to diagnosis. 
No difference in abundance was seen between samples collected prior to diagnosis 
or after treatment as compared with population controls, indicating that this 
protein signature is mainly informative close to time of diagnosis. Further 
studies are needed to determine the optimal window in time prior to diagnosis 
for these biomarker candidates.

Health-Promoting Behaviors and Menopausal Symptoms: An Interventional Study in 
Rural India.

Malik E(1), Sheoran P(1), Siddiqui A(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Menopausal transition initiates with menstrual cycle length variety 
and finishes when last menstrual period happens. As life expectancy has 
increased, a menopausal woman has to spend one-third of her life span with 
estrogen deprivation stage that leads to major long-term symptomatic and 
metabolic complications.
METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study conducted on 103 menopausal women 
between 40 and 60 years of age residing in Ambala district, Haryana. In the 
experimental group, women received lifestyle modification program that includes 
six domains, i.e., health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, 
spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Intervention 
was divided into two sessions of total 2-h duration on 2 consecutive days. 
Sociodemographic pro forma, Menopausal Rating Scale, and Health Promoting 
Lifestyle Profile II were used to collect data from women through face-to-face 
interview.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in mean menopausal 
symptom score and mean health-promoting behavior score in the experimental group 
after the intervention, but there was no significant difference in the 
comparison group (P > 0.05). It was revealed that there was no significant 
difference between the groups with regard to mean menopausal symptom score and 
mean health-promoting behavior score before intervention (P < 0.05). The mean 
posttest menopausal symptom score (t = -8.99, P = 0.01**) was significantly low 
and the mean health-promoting behavior score (t = 8.7, P = 0.01**) was 
significantly high in the experimental group.
CONCLUSION: Based on the finding of the study, it can be concluded that 
Lifestyle modification program was significantly effective in reducing 
menopausal symptoms and improving health-promoting behaviors among women.

The Role of Palliative Care in Chronic Progressive Neurological Diseases-A 
Survey Amongst Neurologists in the Netherlands.

Background: Chronic progressive neurological diseases like high grade glioma 
(HGG), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are incurable, and 
associated with increasing disability including cognitive impairment, and 
reduced life expectancy. Patients with these diseases have complex care needs. 
Therefore, timely advance care planning (ACP) is required. Our aim was to 
investigate timing and content of discussions on treatment restrictions, i.e., 
to initiate, withhold, or withdraw treatment in patients with HGG, PD, and MS, 
from the neurologists' perspective. Methods: We performed a national online 
survey amongst consultants in neurology and residents in The Netherlands. The 
questionnaire focused on their daily practice concerning timing and content of 
discussions on treatment restrictions with patients suffering from HGG, PD or 
MS. We also inquired about education and training in discussing these issues. 
Results: A total of 125 respondents [89 neurologists (71%), 62% male, with a 
median age of 44 years, and 36 residents (29%), 31% male with a median age of 29 
years] responded. Initial discussions on treatment restrictions were said to 
take place during the first year after diagnosis in 28% of patients with HGG, 
and commonly no earlier than in the terminal phase in patients with PD and MS. 
In all conditions, significant cognitive decline was the most important trigger 
to advance discussions, followed by physical decline, and initiation of the 
terminal phase. Most discussed issues included ventilation, resuscitation, and 
admission to the intensive care unit. More than half of the consultants in 
neurology and residents felt that they needed (more) education and training in 
having discussions on treatment restrictions. Conclusion: In patients with HGG 
discussions on treatment restrictions are initiated earlier than in patients 
with PD or MS. However, in all three diseases these discussions usually take 
place when significant physical and cognitive decline has become apparent and 
commonly mark the initiation of end-of-life care. More than half of the 
responding consultants in neurology and residents feel the need for improvement 
of their skills in performing these discussions.

BACKGROUND: People with depression/anxiety are twice as likely to smoke and are 
less responsive to standard tobacco treatments, leading to a reduced life 
expectancy of up to  13.6 years compared to people without depression/anxiety. 
However, this group of smokers is motivated to quit, and as a result of quitting 
smoking, their depression/anxiety is likely to improve. In England, people with 
depression/anxiety are referred to a primary care-based psychological therapies 
service known as 'Improving Access to Psychological Therapies' (IAPT), which 
could offer smoking cessation treatment as part of usual care but currently does 
not. In this study, we aim (1) to establish the feasibility and acceptability of 
delivering a smoking cessation treatment alongside IAPT usual care and (2) to 
establish the feasibility of a multi-centre randomised trial to compare the 
combined smoking cessation and IAPT treatment to usual IAPT treatment alone.
METHODS: A randomised and controlled, multi-centre trial to test the 
acceptability, feasibility and implementation of smoking cessation treatment as 
offered alongside usual IAPT care, compared to usual care alone, with nested 
qualitative methods. We will include adult daily smokers with 
depression/anxiety, who would like help to quit smoking and are about to start 
IAPT treatment. Follow-up will be conducted at 3-months after baseline. The main 
outcome will be retention in the smoking cessation treatment. Secondary outcomes 
are smoking-related (biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence smoking 
cessation, number of cigarettes smoked per day, Heaviness of Smoking Index), 
mental health-related (PHQ-9), service-related (number of 'Did Not Attends', 
number of planned and completed IAPT sessions), acceptability and feasibility 
(participant and clinician acceptability and satisfaction of intervention as 
assessed by questionnaires and qualitative interviews, interviews will also 
explore acceptability and feasibility of data collection procedures and impact 
of smoking cessation treatment on usual care and mental health recovery) and 
implementation-related (intervention delivery checklist, qualitative analysis of 
intervention delivery).
DISCUSSION: If the intervention is shown to be acceptable, feasible and suitably 
implemented, we can conduct a randomised controlled trial. In a future trial, we 
would examine whether adding smoking cessation treatment increases smoking 
abstinence and improves depression and anxiety more than usual care, which would 
lead to long-term health improvement.

Age-at-death distributions provide an informative description of the mortality 
pattern of a population but have generally been neglected for modelling and 
forecasting mortality. In this paper, we use the distribution of deaths to model 
and forecast adult mortality. Specifically, we introduce a relational model that 
relates a fixed 'standard' to a series of observed distributions by a 
transformation of the age axis. The proposed Segmented Transformation 
Age-at-death Distributions (STAD) model is parsimonious and efficient: using 
only three parameters, it captures and disentangles mortality developments in 
terms of shifting and compression dynamics. Additionally, mortality forecasts 
can be derived from parameter extrapolation using time-series models. We 
illustrate our method and compare it with the Lee-Carter model and variants for 
females in four high-longevity countries. We show that the STAD fits the 
observed mortality pattern very well, and that its forecasts are more accurate 
and optimistic than the Lee-Carter variants.

Schizophrenia affects about 0.7 % of the population and is characterized by 
hallucinations, delusions and reduced functioning affecting the ability to 
study, work and socialize. Life expectancy for patients with schizophrenia is 
approximately 15-20 years shorter mostly due to cardiovascular disease. 
Stigmatization is  common despite the fact that it is a treatable disorder with 
a combination of medication and psychosocial interventions. Case management, 
psycho-education and supported employment are proven strategies, but less than 
half of individuals with schizophrenia are adequately treated. The National 
Board of Health and Welfare is currently launching updated National Guidelines 
(2018). The aim is to provide an overview of evidence-based interventions 
enabling patients with schizophrenia to live a fairly normal life. An evaluation 
has revealed that previous guidelines for antipsychotic medications have been 
satisfactorily implemented, but not those for psychosocial interventions. These 
will now be emphasized as »central recommendations« and will be followed up with 
specific indicators based on data from national registers.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has surely increased the life expectancy of 
people living with HIV. However, long term complications like HIV associated 
sensory neuropathy has a negative impact on quality of life among people living 
with HIV (PLHIV). In Ethiopia, lack of data on magnitude of the burden and 
predictors of HIV associated sensory neuropathy in many resource limited setting 
has led to under diagnosis and eventually under management of HIV-SN. Hence, 
this study was set out to establish the burden of HIV-associated sensory 
neuropathy and, its association with demographic, health and clinical 
characteristics among people living with HIV in Ethiopia.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of 
HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and the associated factors among adult HIV 
patients at University of Gondar Teaching Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. Brief 
Peripheral Neuropathy Screening tool validated by AIDs Clinical trial group was 
used for screening HIV-associated sensory neuropathy. Data were analyzed 
descriptively and through uni- and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total 359 adult PLHIV with a mean age of 36.5± 9.07 years 
participated, their median duration of HIV infection was 60 months (IQR 36-84) 
and their median CD4 count 143cells/μL (IQR 69.5-201.5). Age above 40 years, 
anti-tuberculosis regimen, tallness, and exposure to didanosine contained 
antiretroviral therapy were found to be associated with HIV-associated sensory 
neuropathy (AOR 1.82, 1.84, 1.98 and 4.33 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the HIV patients who attended HIV care clinic at 
University of Gondar hospital during the study period were found to present with 
peripheral sensory neuropathy. Higher age, tallness, TB medication, and 
didanosine in ART were significantly associated with HIV-SN as screened by 
effective diagnostic (BPNS) tool.

The promotion of self-medication was announced in the "strategy for the 
reconstruction of Japan", which was approved in June 2013 by the cabinet, with 
the concepts of "extending healthy life expectancy" and estab- lishing 
"pharmacy-based laboratory testing services". In April 2014, the "guideline for 
pharmacy-based laboratory testing" was published, and approximately 1,000 
pharmacies were registered as service providers as of the end of May 2015. 
Issues of providing pharmacy-based laboratory testing services were as follows: 
1) appropriate techniques for fingertip blood sampling, 2) quality control 
including the maintenance and management of devices and reagents, 3) infection 
prevention, and 4) provision of information on examination results and factors 
affecting the examination to examinees. The improvement of health screening 
rates remains to be resolved in order to achieve "extension of healthy life 
expectancy" and reduce medical costs. The involvement of clinical testing 
specialists is essen- tial to resolve the above issues for the appropriate 
management of pharmacy-based laboratory testing ser- vices. [Review].

North American grapevine yellows (NAGY) disease has sometimes been attributed to 
infection of Vitis vinifera L. by Prunus X-disease phytoplasma ('Candidatus 
Phytoplasma pruni') but this attribution may not be fully adequate. In this 
study, phytoplasma strains related to 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni' were found in 
NAGY-diseased grapevines in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, 
and New York State. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis 
of 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) sequences, the strains (termed NAGYIII 
strains) were classified in group 16SrIII (X-disease group) but they contained a 
recognition site for the restriction endonuclease MseI that is not present in 
the 16S rDNA of 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni'. The 16S rDNA of the strains differed by 
three or four nucleotides from that of 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni', indicating that 
they belonged to two novel 16S rDNA sequevars, designated NAGYIIIα and NAGYIIIβ. 
Both sequevars differed from 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni' by a single base in each of 
three regions corresponding to species-unique (signature) sequences described 
for 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni'. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA genes and SecY 
proteins, and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of secY and ribosomal 
protein genes, further distinguished the two grapevine sequevar lineages from 
one another and from 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni'. The NAGYIIIα and NAGYIIIβ 
sequevars also differed from 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni' in regions of the folded 
SecY protein that are predicted to be near or exposed at the outer surface of 
the phytoplasma membrane. No evidence indicated that diseased grapevines 
contained any phytoplasma strain conforming to 'Ca. Phytoplasma pruni' sensu 
stricto. Because the NAGYIII sequevars have not been reported in X-disease, a 
question is raised as to whether NAGYIII and Prunus X-disease are caused by 
different phytoplasma genotypes.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the dietary patterns of children aged 4-7 years and 
verify their association with sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits 
and exclusive breast-feeding (EBF).
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study nested within a cohort, performed with Brazilian 
children aged 4-7 years. The children were re-evaluated at age 4 to 7 years and 
food patterns were identified a posteriori through principal component analysis. 
The predictive variables were related to socio-economic characteristics, 
lifestyle habits and duration of EBF.
SETTING: Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.ParticipantsRepresentative sample of 403 
children followed up by the Lactation Support Program from the Extension Program 
of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa during the first 6 months of life.
RESULTS: Five dietary patterns were identified: 'Traditional', 'Unhealthy', 
'Milk and chocolate', 'Snack' and 'Healthy'. Children who did not receive EBF 
until they were at least 4 months old had a higher adherence to the 'Unhealthy' 
and 'Snack' patterns, and older children also consumed more 'Unhealthy' foods. 
The highest income was associated with the highest consumption of foods of the 
patterns 'Unhealthy', 'Milk and chocolate' and 'Healthy'.
CONCLUSIONS: In view of the results, we emphasize the importance of providing 
support and encouragement towards EBF in the first months of life, as it can 
positively influence lifelong eating habits.

The direct or indirect experience of crime can cause individuals to feel 
vengeful against the perpetrator(s). The prison system reflects this sentiment 
by creating austere environments that are dehumanizing, punitive, and hopeless. 
Prisons are, therefore, environments in which retribution and punishment take 
priority over rehabilitation. Frequently, prisoners are believed to be 
untreatable because of their antisocial orientation. However, several factors 
influence an antisocial orientation such as socioeconomic status, family of 
origin, and mental health. The ubiquitous nothing works misbelief has resulted 
in prisoner marginalization and increased recidivism because of insufficient 
treatment. In 2015, 10 million individuals were incarcerated worldwide with 
around 30 million circulating through prisons each year. The prison environment 
decreases prisoner life expectancy and overall health. Sadly, prisoner benefits 
from treatment post-incarceration dissipate after 3-6 months and many prisoners 
die by suicide or drug overdose. Prison overpopulation, as well as poor outcome 
post-incarceration, requires more effective treatment. We hypothesize that 
Prisoner Exposure to Nature (PEN) can transform prisons into environments that 
are conducive to maintaining and improving physical and mental health. In prior 
work we proposed the continuum Nature Exposure Sufficiency (NES) versus Nature 
Exposure Insufficiency (NEI). Prisons are impoverished environments that limit 
Nature Exposure (NE) which results in NEI. Individuals experience fluctuations 
in mental and physical health as a result of NEI. Numerous studies have shown 
that direct and indirect NE can improve mood, physical health, and facilitate 
connectivity with self and society. It is necessary to consider ways in which we 
can incorporate NE for prisoner wellbeing. Additionally, it is crucial that 
prison personnel and prisoners develop a therapeutic/helping relationship (i.e., 
alliance) that is facilitated by friendliness and warmth to foster social change 
and citizenship. Many prisoners experience isolation and disconnection with 
society upon reentry. Given that most prisoners are eventually released into the 
community, we are obligated not to make them worse. Hence, it is important that 
prisons create programs that develop citizenship to engender prisoner volition 
to become positive and active citizens. We focus on the prison and prisoners, 
however our work is relevant to all total institutions (e.g., mental hospitals, 
nursing homes, schools, etc.). The prison system favors punishment and mass 
incarceration over treatment and decarceration. The deleterious effects of 
incarceration are clear and it is time to implement treatments based on the 
principles of PEN to improve prisoner wellbeing and citizenship.

The marked increase in life expectancy for HIV-1 seropositive individuals, 
following the great success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), 
heralds an examination of the progression of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive 
disorders (HAND). However, since the seminal call for animal models of 
HIV-1/AIDS in 1988, there has been no extant in vivo animal model system 
available to provide a truly longitudinal study of HAND. Here, we demonstrate 
that the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat, resembling HIV-1 seropositive individuals on 
lifelong cART, exhibits age-related, progressive neurocognitive impairments 
(NCI), including alterations in learning, sustained attention, flexibility, and 
inhibition; deficits commonly observed in HIV-1 seropositive individuals. 
Pyramidal neurons from layers II-III of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
displayed profound synaptic dysfunction in HIV-1 Tg animals relative to 
controls; dysfunction that was characterized by alterations in dendritic 
branching complexity, synaptic connectivity, and dendritic spine morphology. NCI 
and synaptic dysfunction in pyramidal neurons from layers II-III of the mPFC 
independently identified the presence of the HIV-1 transgene with at least 78.5% 
accuracy. Thus, even in the absence of sensory or motor system deficits and 
comorbidities, HAND is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by age-related 
disease progression; impairments which may be due, at least partly, to synaptic 
dysfunction in the mPFC. Further, the progression of HAND with age in the HIV-1 
Tg rat and associated synaptic dysfunction affords an instrumental model system 
for the development of therapeutics and functional cure strategies.

BACKGROUND: While the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) guidelines advise exercise to reduce disease progression, little 
investment in promoting physical activity (PA) is made by health care 
authorities. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
regular PA vs sedentary lifestyle in people with COPD in the UK.
METHODS: Efficacy, quality of life, and economic evidence on the PA effects in 
COPD patients were retrieved from literature to serve as input for a Markov 
microsimulation model comparing a COPD population performing PA vs a COPD 
population with sedentary lifestyle. The GOLD classification defined the model 
health states. For the base case, the cost of PA was estimated at zero, a 
lifetime horizon was used, and costs and effects were discounted at 3.5%. 
Analyses were performed from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. 
Uncertainty around inputs and assumptions were explored via scenario and 
sensitivity analyses, including a cost threshold analysis. Outcomes were 
cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost/year gained.
RESULTS: Based on our model, the effects of PA in the UK COPD population would 
be lower mortality (-6%), fewer hospitalizations (-2%), gains in years (+0.82) 
and QALYs (+0.66), and total cost savings of £2,568. The cost/QALY and cost/year 
gained were dominant. PA was cost-saving at costs <£35/month and cost-effective 
at cost <£202/month. The main model drivers were age and PA impact on death and 
hospital-treated exacerbations.
CONCLUSION: Including PA in the management of COPD leads to long-term clinical 
benefits. If the NHS promotes only exercise via medical advice, this would lead 
to health care cost savings. If the NHS chose to fund PA, it would still likely 
be cost-effective.

The sit-to-stand motion is a common movement in daily life and understanding the 
mechanism of the sit-to-stand motion is important. Our previous study shows that 
four muscle synergies can characterize the sit-to-stand motion, and they have 
specific roles, such as upper body flexion, rising from a chair, body extension, 
and posture stabilization. The time-varying weight of these synergies are 
changed to achieve adaptive movement. However, the relationship between sensory 
input and the activation of the muscle synergies is not completely understood. 
In this paper, we aim to clarify how vestibular and visual inputs affect the 
muscle synergy in sit-to-stand motion. To address this, we conducted experiments 
as follows. Muscle activity, body kinematics, and ground reaction force were 
measured for the sit-to-stand motion under three different conditions: control, 
visual-disturbance, and vestibular-disturbance conditions. Under the control 
condition, the participants stood without any intervention. Under the 
visual-disturbance condition, the participants wore convex lens glasses and 
performed the sit-to-stand motion in a dark room. Under the 
vestibular-disturbance condition, a caloric test was performed. Muscle synergies 
were calculated for these three conditions using non-negative matrix 
factorization. We examined whether the same four muscle synergies were employed 
under each condition, and the changes in the time-varying coefficients were 
determined. These experiments were conducted on seven healthy, young 
participants. It was found that four muscle synergies could explain the muscle 
activity in the sit-to-stand motion under the three conditions. However, there 
were significant differences in the time-varying weight coefficients. When the 
visual input was disturbed, a larger amplitude was found for the muscle synergy 
that activated mostly in the final posture stabilization phase of the 
sit-to-stand motion. Under vestibular-disturbance condition, a longer activation 
was observed for the synergies that extended the entire body and led to posture 
stabilization. The results implied that during human sit-to-stand motion, visual 
input has less contribution to alter or correct activation of muscle synergies 
until the last phase. On the other hand, duration of muscle synergies after the 
buttocks leave are prolonged in order to adapt to the unstable condition in 
which sense of verticality is decreased under vestibular-disturbance.

OBJECTIVES: Understanding the role of functional capacity on longevity is 
important as the population in the United States ages. The purpose of this study 
was to determine the burden of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 
and activities of daily living (ADL) disabilities for a 
nationally-representative sample of middle-aged and older adults in the United 
States.
DESIGN: Longitudinal-Panel.
SETTING: Core interviews were often performed in person or over the telephone.
PARTICIPANTS: A sub-sample of 31,055 participants aged at least 50 years from 
the 1998-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study who reported having a 
functional disability were included.
MEASUREMENTS: Ability to perform IADLs and ADLs were self-reported at each wave. 
The National Death Index was used to ascertain date of death. The number of 
years of life that were lost (YLLs) and years lived with a disability (YLDs) 
were summed for the calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
Sampling weights were used in the analyses to make the DALYs 
nationally-representative. The results for YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs are reported in 
thousands.
RESULTS: Of the participants included, 14,990 had an IADL disability and 13,136 
had an ADL disability. Men and women with an IADL disability had 236,037 and 
233,772 DALYs, respectively; whereas, there were 178,594 DALYs for males and 
253,630 DALYs for females with an ADL disability. Collectively, there were 
469,809 years of healthy life lost from IADL impairments, and 432,224 years of 
healthy life lost from ADL limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be used to inform healthcare providers and 
guide interventions aiming to preserve the functional capacity of aging adults. 
Prioritizing health-related resources for mitigating the burden of functional 
disabilities may help aging adults increase their quality of life and life 
expectancy over time.

OBJECTIVE: While CVD risk has decreased in the general population during the 
last decade, the situation in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar 
disorder (BD) is unknown.
METHODS: We compared CVD risk factors in patients with SCZ and BD recruited from 
2002-2005 (2005 sample, N = 270) with patients recruited from 2006-2017 (2017 
sample, N = 1011) from the same catchment area in Norway. The 2017 sample was 
also compared with healthy controls (N = 922) and the general population (N 
range = 1285-4587, Statistics Norway) from the same area and period.
RESULTS: Patients with SCZ and BD in the 2017 sample had significantly higher 
level of most CVD risk factors compared to healthy controls and the general 
population. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of CVD risk 
factors in SCZ between the 2005 and 2017 samples except a small increase in 
glucose in the 2017 sample. There were small-to-moderate reductions in 
hypertension, obesity, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure in the BD 2017 sample compared to the 2005 sample.
CONCLUSION: Despite major advances in health promotion during the past decade, 
there has been no reduction in the level of CVD risk factors in patients with 
SCZ and modest improvement in BD.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetic testing can provide predictive insights about the 
efficacy and safety of drugs used in cancer treatment. Although many drug-gene 
associations have been reported in the literature, the strength of evidence 
supporting each association can vary significantly. Even among the subgroup of 
drugs classified by the PharmGKB database to have a high or moderate level of 
evidence, there is limited information regarding the economic value of 
pharmacogenetic testing.
OBJECTIVES: To: (a) summarize the available pharmacoeconomic evidence assessing 
the value of pharmacogenetic testing for cancer drugs with clinically relevant
