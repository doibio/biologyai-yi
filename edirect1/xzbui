fit and unfit patients with low-risk or high-risk T1 colonic cancer were 
studied. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In low-risk T1 colonic neoplasia, endoscopic resection increases QALE 
by 0.09 QALYS for fit 65-year-olds and by 0.67 for unfit 80-year-olds. For 
high-risk T1 cancers, the QALE benefit for surgical resection is 0.24 QALYs for 
fit 65-year-olds and the endoscopic QALE benefit is 0.47 for unfit 80-year-olds. 
The model findings only favored surgery with high local recurrence rates and 
when quality of life under surveillance was perceived poorly.
CONCLUSIONS: Under broad assumptions, endoscopic resection is a reasonable 
treatment option for both low-risk and high-risk T1 colonic cancer, particularly 
in elderly, comorbid patients. Exploration of methods to facilitate endoscopic 
resection of T1 colonic neoplasia appears warranted.

BACKGROUND: There are substantial socioeconomic inequalities in both life 
expectancy and healthcare use in England. In this study, we describe how these 
two sets of inequalities interact by estimating the social gradient in hospital 
costs across the life course.
METHODS: Hospital episode statistics, population and index of multiple 
deprivation data were combined at lower-layer super output area level to 
estimate inpatient hospital costs for 2011/2012 by age, sex and deprivation 
quintile. Survival curves were estimated for each of the deprivation groups and 
used to estimate expected annual costs and cumulative lifetime costs.
RESULTS: A steep social gradient was observed in overall inpatient hospital 
admissions, with rates ranging from 31 298/100 000 population in the most 
affluent fifth of areas to 43 385 in the most deprived fifth. This gradient was 
steeper for emergency than for elective admissions. The total cost associated 
with this inequality in 2011/2012 was £4.8 billion. A social gradient was also 
observed in the modelled lifetime costs where the lower life expectancy was not 
sufficient to outweigh the higher average costs in the more deprived 
populations. Lifetime costs for women were 14% greater than for men, due to 
higher costs in the reproductive years and greater life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic inequalities result in increased morbidity and 
decreased life expectancy. Interventions to reduce inequality and improve health 
in more deprived neighbourhoods have the potential to save money for health 
systems not only within years but across peoples' entire lifetimes, despite 
increased costs due to longer life expectancies.

BACKGROUND: Hip arthroscopic surgery has emerged as a successful procedure to 
manage acetabular labral tears and concurrent hip injuries, which if left 
untreated, may contribute to hip osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, it is essential 
to analyze the economic impact of this treatment option.
PURPOSE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopic surgery 
versus structured rehabilitation alone for acetabular labral tears, to examine 
the effects of age on cost-effectiveness, and to estimate the rate of 
symptomatic OA and total hip arthroplasty (THA) in both treatment arms over a 
lifetime horizon.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of hip arthroscopic surgery compared with 
structured rehabilitation for symptomatic labral tears was performed using a 
Markov decision model constructed over a lifetime horizon. It was assumed that 
patients did not have OA. Direct costs (in 2014 United States dollars), 
utilities of health states (in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained), and 
probabilities of transitioning between health states were estimated from a 
comprehensive literature review. Costs were estimated using national averages of 
Medicare reimbursements, adjusted for all payers in the United States from a 
societal perspective. Utilities were estimated from the Harris Hip Score. 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
determine the effect of uncertainty on the model outcomes.
RESULTS: For a cohort representative of patients undergoing hip arthroscopic 
surgery at our facility, arthroscopic surgery was more costly (additional $2653) 
but generated more utility (additional 3.94 QALYs) compared with rehabilitation 
over a lifetime. The mean ICER was $754/QALY, well below the conventional 
willingness to pay of $50,000/QALY. Arthroscopic surgery was cost-effective for 
94.5% of patients. Although arthroscopic surgery decreased in cost-effectiveness 
with increasing age, arthroscopic surgery remained more cost-effective than 
rehabilitation for patients in the second to seventh decades of life. The 
lifetime incidence of symptomatic hip OA was over twice as high for patients 
treated with rehabilitation compared with arthroscopic surgery. The preferred 
treatment was sensitive to the utility after successful hip arthroscopic 
surgery, although the utility at which arthroscopic surgery becomes less 
cost-effective than rehabilitation is far below our best estimate. For older 
patients, the lifetime cost of arthroscopic surgery was greater, while the 
lifetime utility of arthroscopic surgery was less, approaching that of the 
rehabilitation arm.
CONCLUSION: Hip arthroscopic surgery is more cost-effective and results in a 
considerably lower incidence of symptomatic OA than structured rehabilitation 
alone in treating symptomatic labral tears of patients in the second to seventh 
decades of life without pre-existing OA.

[Purpose] This study was performed to examine the effects of subacute physical 
therapy (PT) on activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life, and geriatric 
aspects of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip 
arthroplasty (THA). [Subjects] The subjects were TKA (n=56) and THA (n=39) 
patients who received PT on the first day of independent ADL (up to 2 weeks) and 
just prior to discharge (4 weeks). [Methods] The functional independence measure 
(FIM), grip strength, knee extension strength (KES), timed up and go (TUG) test, 
mini-mental state examination (MMSE), geriatric depression scale short form 
(GDS-15), fall efficacy scale (FES), and medical outcome study 8-item short-form 
health survey (SF-8) were used as outcome measure, and comorbidity involvement 
was also investigated. [Results] Improvements in FIM, KES, TUG, GDS-15, FES, and 
SF-8 scores were seen in both groups (effect size, 0.31-0.87). Poor PT effects 
were found for THA patients aged ≥65 years, for TKA and THA patients with an 
MMSE score ≤28, and for THA patients with two or more comorbidities. 
[Conclusion] Positive effects were seen in patients who received PT at 2-4 weeks 
after surgery. Thus, additional PT for approximately 2 weeks after the beginning 
of independent ADL may be beneficial.

BACKGROUND: Lower rates of substance abuse are found among Black Americans 
compared to Whites, but little is known about differences in substance abuse 
across ethnic groups within the black population.
OBJECTIVES: We examined prevalence rates of substance abuse among Blacks across 
three geographic regions (US, Jamaica, Guyana). The study also sought to 
ascertain whether length of time, national context and major depressive episodes 
(MDE) were associated with substance abuse.
METHODS: We utilized three different data sources based upon probability samples 
collected in three different countries. The samples included 3,570 African 
Americans and 1,621 US Caribbean Black adults from the 2001-2003 National Survey 
of American Life (NSAL). An additional 1,142 Guyanese Blacks and 1,176 Jamaican 
Blacks living in the Caribbean region were included from the 2005 NSAL 
replication extension study, Family Connections Across Generations and Nations 
(FCGN). Mental disorders were based upon DSM-IV criteria. For the analysis, we 
used descriptive statistics, chi-square, and multivariate logistic regression 
analytic procedures.
RESULTS: Prevalence of substance abuse varied by national context, with higher 
rates among Blacks within the United States compared to the Caribbean region. 
Rates of substance abuse were lower overall for women, but differ across cohorts 
by nativity and length of time in the United States, and in association with 
major depressive episode.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the need for further examination of how 
substance abuse disparities between US-based and Caribbean-based populations may 
become manifested.

Larval interactions of dipteran species, blow flies in particular, were observed 
and documented daily over time and location on five black bear carcasses in 
Gainesville, FL, USA, from June 2002 - September 2004. Cochliomyia macellaria 
(Fabricius) or Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) larvae were collected first, 
after which Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) oviposited on the carcasses in 
multiple locations (i.e., neck, anus, and exposed flesh) not inhabited already 
by the other blow fly larvae. Within the first week of decomposition, C. 
rufifacies larvae grew to ≥12 mm, filling the carcasses with thousands of larvae 
and replacing the other calliphorid larvae either through successful food source 
competition or by predation. As a result, C. macellaria and C. megacephala were 
not collected past their third instar feeding stage. The blow fly species, C. 
megacephala, C. macellaria, Lucilia caeruleiviridis (Macquart), Phormia regina 
(Meigen), Lucilia sericata (Meigen), and C. rufifacies, completed two 
developmental cycles in the 88.5-kg carcass. This phenomenon might serve to 
complicate or prevent the calculation of an accurate postmortem interval.

OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been shown to improve 
overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. This study 
aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SBRT compared to sorafenib which is 
the only drug for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was performed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of SBRT and sorafenib for unresectable advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients transitioned between three health states: 
stable disease, progression disease and death. We calculated the data on cost 
from the perspective of our National Health Insurance Bureau. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to determine the impact of several variables.
RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sorafenib compared 
to SBRT was NT$3,788,238 per quality-adjusted life year gained (cost/QALY), 
which was higher than the willingness to pay threshold of Taiwan according to 
WHO's guideline. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the utility of 
progression disease for the sorafenib treatment, utility of progression free 
survival for SBRT, utility of progression free survival for sorafenib, utility 
of PFS to progression disease for SBRT and transition probability of progression 
disease to dead for SBRT were the most sensitive parameters in all cost 
scenarios. The Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrated that the probability of 
cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay threshold of NT$ 2,213,145 per QALY 
was 100 % and 0 % chance for SBRT and sorafenib.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that SBRT for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
is cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold as defined by WHO guideline 
in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Long-term, randomized trial results comparing completion lymph node 
dissection (CLND) with observation for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) 
metastases are not available. Our goal was to determine whether melanoma 
patients with SLN metastases should undergo CLND.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate the prognosis of hypothetical 
cohorts of patients with SLN metastases who underwent either immediate CLND or 
observation with delayed CLND if macroscopic disease developed. Model parameters 
were derived from published studies and included the likelihood of non-SLN 
metastases, risk of dying from melanoma, CLND complication rates, and 
health-related quality-of-life weights. Outcomes included 5-year overall 
survival (OS), life expectancy (LE), and quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE).
RESULTS: The projected 5-year OS for 50-year-old patients with SLN metastases 
who underwent immediate CLND was 67.2 % compared with 63.1 % for the observation 
group. The LE gained by undergoing immediate CLND ranged from 2.19 years for 
patients aged 30 to 0.64 years for patients aged 70 years. The QALE gained by 
undergoing immediate CLND ranged from 1.39 quality-adjusted life years for 
patients aged 30 to 0.36 for patients aged 70 years. In sensitivity analysis 
over a clinically plausible range of values for each input parameter, immediate 
CLND was no longer beneficial when the rate of long-term complications increased 
and the quality-of-life weight for long-term complications decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CLND following positive SLN biopsy was associated with OS 
and QALE gains compared with observation and delayed CLND for those who develop 
clinically apparent LN metastases.

Colon interposition has been used since the beginning of the 20(th) century as a 
substitute for esophageal replacement. Colon interposition is mainly chosen as a 
second line treatment when the stomach cannot be used, when the stomach has to 
be resected for oncological or technical reasons, or when the stomach is 
deliberately kept intact for benign diseases in young patients with long-life 
expectancy. During the surgery the vascularization of the colon must be 
carefully assessed, as well as the type of the graft (right or left colon), the 
length of the graft, the surgical approach and the route of the reconstruction. 
Early complications such as graft necrosis or anastomotic leaks, and late 
complications such as redundancy depend on the quality of the initial surgery. 
Despite a complex and time-consuming procedure requiring at least three or four 
digestive anastomoses, reported long term functional outcomes of colon 
interposition are good, with an acceptable operative risk. Thus, in very 
selected indications, colon interposition could be seen as a valuable 
alternative for esophageal replacement when stomach cannot be considered. This 
review aims at briefly defining "when" and "how" to perform a coloplasty through 
demonstrative videos.

Brachial-Ankle Pulse Wave Velocity: Background, Method, and Clinical Evidence.

BACKGROUND: The populations of many developed countries are becoming 
progressively older. In aged societies, assessment of total vascular risk is 
critically important, because old age is usually associated with multiple risks. 
In this regard, pulse wave velocity (PWV) could be a global cardiovascular 
marker, since it increases with advancing age, high blood pressure, 
hyperglycaemia, and other traditional risks, summating cardiovascular risks. 
Carotid-femoral PWV has been widely applied in Western countries and has been 
used as a gold-standard PWV measure. However, this measure has never been 
implemented by general practitioners in Japan, possibly because of 
methodological difficulties. The life expectancy of Japanese people is now the 
highest in the world, and the establishment of an adequate total vascular risk 
measure is an urgent need. Against this background, brachial-ankle PWV was 
developed at the beginning of this century.
SUMMARY: Measurement of this parameter is easy, and its reproducibility is good. 
Moreover, the generality of the methodology is guaranteed. Brachial-ankle PWV 
has been reported to consistently increase with most traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors except dyslipidaemia. A meta-analysis of cohort studies including 
various levels of risk has shown that a 1 m/s increase in brachial-ankle PWV is 
associated with a 12% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. Moreover, 
simultaneous evaluation of the ankle-brachial index could allow further risk 
stratification of high-risk individuals, who are common in aged societies. This 
unique feature is indispensable for the management of aged populations, who 
usually are exposed to multiple risks and have polyvascular diseases. This 
evidence, however, is chiefly derived from East Asian countries. The collection 
of data from Caucasian populations, therefore, remains a task for the future.
KEY MESSAGE: Brachial-ankle PWV has the potential to become a measure of 
arterial stiffness worldwide.

Thanks to the emergence of combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV/AIDS has been 
transformed into a manageable, chronic condition in just 30 years and the life 
expectancy of patients living with HIV is now comparable to those without. 
Recent data (START) support the strategy of starting all HIV-positive patients 
regardless of CD4 count. However, patients and physicians want more than just 
viral control: they want better tolerability, convenience, and few drug-drug 
interactions. Are the guidelines right in recommending an integrase 
inhibitor-based regimen as the first-line treatment of choice?

To compare the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through treatment 
with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass (LRYGB), and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of medical treatment, LSG, 
and LRYGB in T2DM patients (BMI ≥ 28).A 2-group randomized controlled trial was 
conducted at Diabetes Surgery Centre, Beijing Shijitan Hospital in Beijing, 
China. Subjects were 80 patients ages 16 to 65 years with a body mass index of 
28 kg/m or more and duration of T2DM no more than 15 years. Subjects were 
randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo either LSG (n = 40) or LRYGB (n = 40) between 
February 3, 2011 and October 31, 2013. Of those patients, 72 (90%) were 
available at follow-up at 2 years. These patients included 34 (85%) who 
underwent LSG and 38 (95%) who underwent LRYGB. This study presents the 
follow-up data at 2 years, which compared LSG and LRYGB in T2DM patients. 
Partial remission and complete remission were determined, and weight loss, BMI, 
changes in abdominal circumference, cholesterol, and triglycerides were 
measured. The cost-effectiveness of each type of bariatric surgery was analyzed 
with a Markov simulation model that yielded quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and costs.From our analysis results, LSG and LRYGB are both have taken a great 
effect on the reduction of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
and bodyweight in patients with T2DM. The cost-effectiveness ratios of medical 
treatment, LSG, and LRYGB respectively are 1589.02, 1028.97, and 1197.44 dollars 
per QALY.Our analysis indicates that LSG appear to provide a cost-effective 
method of T2DM treatment for the patients.

AIMS: The WHO's draft HCV elimination targets propose an 80% reduction in 
incidence and a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths by 2030. We estimate the 
treatment scale-up required and cost-effectiveness of reaching these targets 
among injecting drug use (IDU)-acquired infections using Australian disease 
estimates.
METHODS: A mathematical model of HCV transmission, liver disease progression and 
treatment among current and former people who inject drugs (PWID). Treatment 
scale-up and the most efficient allocation to priority groups (PWID or patients 
with advanced liver disease) were determined; total healthcare and treatment 
costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) compared with inaction were calculated.
RESULTS: 5662 (95% CI 5202 to 6901) courses per year (30/1000 IDU-acquired 
infections) were required, prioritised to patients with advanced liver disease, 
to reach the mortality target. 4725 (3278-8420) courses per year (59/1000 PWID) 
were required, prioritised to PWID, to reach the incidence target; this also 
achieved the mortality target, but to avoid clinically unacceptable HCV-related 
deaths an additional 5564 (1959-6917) treatments per year (30/1000 IDU-acquired 
infections) were required for 5 years for patients with advanced liver disease. 
Achieving both targets in this way cost $A4.6 ($A4.2-$A4.9) billion more than 
inaction, but gained 184 000 (119 000-417 000) QALYs, giving an ICER of $A25 121 
($A11 062-$A39 036) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving WHO elimination targets with treatment scale-up is likely 
to be cost-effective, based on Australian HCV burden and demographics. Reducing 
incidence should be a priority to achieve both WHO elimination goals in the 
long-term.

IMPORTANCE: Visual impairment (VI) is an emerging public health concern, 
especially considering the aging population. However, unlike other major chronic 
diseases, VI is often overlooked by investigators assessing the burden of 
diseases.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a description of preference weights for VI and chronic 
diseases from a national survey and estimate the corresponding burden of these 
diseases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a 
multistage, probability-cluster survey, which can produce nationally 
representative estimates. Data on 29 639 participants 19 years or older from the 
2008-2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed 
in terms of vision assessment, status of chronic diseases, and the European 
Quality of Life-Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D). Visual impairment was 
defined as the presenting distance best-corrected visual acuity of worse than 
decimal 0.5. Data analysis was conducted from August 14, 2008, and September 7, 
2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preference weights (utilities) and prevalence-based 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses.
RESULTS: Of the 29 639 participants, 28 382 with VA or EQ-5D measurements were 
included in the analysis; they had a mean (SE) age of 45.05 (0.19) years and a 
mean EQ-5D index of 0.948 (0.001). The preference weight for VI was -0.0549 (95% 
CI, -0.0777 to -0.0321), which was the third highest value among the 12 diseases 
analyzed-preceded only by the preference weights for osteoarthritis or 
rheumatoid arthritis (-0.0688; 95% CI, -0.748 to -0.0628) and stroke (-0.0666; 
95% CI, -0.0854 to -0.0479). The estimated annual QALY loss from VI was -74.93 
years per 100 000 person-years; this loss is comparable to or higher than that 
associated with other major chronic conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarction/ischemic heart disease, asthma, 
obesity, and anemia). Visual impairment accounted for 4.77% of the total 
estimated QALY loss in the Korean population aged 19 years or older.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present study provides a description of 
preference weights for VI and various chronic diseases from a national survey. 
Furthermore, it reveals the distributions of public burden from these 
conditions, and compared them in this regard. Although details might vary across 
the populations having different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, the 
results underscore the importance of VI for quality of life and as a public 
health burden compared with other major chronic diseases.

AIM: There is a knowledge gap about the disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) 
in low- and middle-income countries. The present study aimed to compute and 
compare DFLE in six such countries, and examine sex differences in DFLE in each 
country.
METHODS: Based on data from the World Health Organization Study on Global Aging 
and Adult Health wave 1 survey, we used the Sullivan method to estimate DFLE 
among persons aged years 50 years and older. Disability was divided into 
moderate disability and severe disability during the calculation.
RESULTS: Of the six countries, China had the highest DFLE and lowest expected 
average lifetime with disability. India had the lowest DFLE and highest life 
years with moderate and severe disability. In each country, women live longer 
than men, but with more disabilities in both absolute and proportional terms. 
The huge sex difference in Russia requires special attention. In addition, most 
of the life expectancy lived with disability was spent with severe disability, 
rather than moderate disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The study has shed some light on the disparities across the six 
countries with regard to DFLE at old ages. The low percentage of DFLE in life 
expectancy in some countries, such as India, calls for effective policies on 
healthy aging. The "sex disability-survival paradox" in DFLE is supported by our 
results. To differentiate the severity of disability should be routine in 
calculating DFLE. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 637-644.

[Lung Transplantation in Icelanders].

[Article in Icelandic]

Hansdottir S, Hardardottir H, Einarsson O, Hrafnkelsdottir SK, Gudmundsson G.

INTRODUCTION: Lung transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage lung 
diseases, excluding lung cancer, when life expectancy is short and quality of 
life is poor. In most instances pulmonary function and quality of life improves 
after lung transplantation. Infections and rejection are the most common 
complications and limit the feasibility of lung transplantation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of lung transplantations performed 
on Icelanders from February 1988 to January 2015. Clinical information was 
obtained from medical records and a database was created. Information on 
demographics, underlying lung disease, type of transplantation, 
immunosuppression, rejection and other complications was collected.
RESULTS: A total of 21 lung transplantations were performed, one of which was a 
retransplantation. There were 9 females and 11 males and the mean age was 45 
years (20-61 years). Most of the operations were done at the Sahlgrenska 
hospital in Gothenburg. Bilateral lung transplantion was the most common 
operation. COPD was the most common indication. Rejection and infections were 
the most common complications. Eight of 20 patients have had acute rejection and 
half of the patients chronic rejection. Six of 20 patients are deceased, three 
died from chronic rejection. Median survival is 8,5 years. Five-year survival is 
74%.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantations are currently performed at the Sahlgrenska 
hospital in Gothenburg but follow-up is in the hands of specialized 
pulmonologists in Iceland. Complications and survival for Icelandic patients is 
similar to larger centers. Close cooperation with the transplanting center is 
essential.

TREATED HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS CAN HAVE NORMAL LIFE 
EXPECTANCY: The fact that a sustained virologic response (SVR) is associated 
with an improved outcome of chronic HCV infection, has been demonstrated in 
several studies by comparing patients with and without SVR. The study by Bruno 
et al., however, is the first to demonstrate that patients with compensated 
cirrhosis who achieve SVR will have a life expectancy similar to that of the 
sex- and age-matched general population. Patients were enrolled in historical 
prospective cohort studies from tertiary referral centers from Northern and 
Southern Italy. They were representative of the Italian general population, 
allowing for adequate comparison of patients long-term 10- and 20-year survival 
with national data. Intriguing observations of a trend to worse survival was 
observed in patients with compensated cirrhosis Child-Pugh class A6 as compared 
to A5. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during follow-up after 
SVR was also not negligible, underscoring the need for early treatment 
initiation, hereby preventing cirrhosis development as the main HCC determinant.

Rights-Based Approaches to Ensure Sustainable Nutrition Security.

Banerjee S(1).

Author information:

In India, a rights-based approach has been used to address large-scale 
malnutrition, including both micro- and macro-level nutrition deficiencies. 
Stunting, which is an intergenerational chronic consequence of malnutrition, is 
especially widespread in India (38% among children under 5 years old). To tackle 
this problem, the government of India has designed interventions for the first 
1,000 days, a critical period of the life cycle, through a number of 
community-based programs to fulfill the rights to food and life. However, the 
entitlements providing these rights have not yet produced the necessary changes 
in the malnutrition status of people, especially women and children. The 
government of India has already implemented laws and drafted a constitution that 
covers the needs of its citizens, but corruption, bureaucracy, lack of awareness 
of rights and entitlements and social discrimination limit people's access to 
basic rights and services. To address this crisis, Welthungerhilfe India, 
working in remote villages of the most backward states in India, has shifted 
from a welfare-based approach to a rights-based approach. The Fight Hunger First 
Initiative, started by Welthungerhilfe in 2011, is designed on the premise that 
in the long term, poor people can only leave poverty behind if adequate welfare 
systems are in place and if basic rights are fulfilled; these rights include 
access to proper education, sufficient access to adequate food and income, 
suitable health services and equal rights. Only then can the next generation of 
disadvantaged populations look forward to a new and better future and can growth 
benefit the entire society. The project, co-funded by the Federal Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, is a long-term multi-sectoral program that 
involves institution-building and empowerment.

A new approach based on non-pigmented, stable colored nanoparticles able to 
migrate upon application of an electrical field (10-60 V) has been developed for 
the improvement of the color brightness of e-displays. The scientific challenges 
comprised the development of efficient syntheses of tri- and bifunctional 
dendrimers including branching points for further extension and individual 
decoration with dye (yellow, magenta, cyan). The covalent attachment of these 
scaffolds to silica nanoparticles was performed via hydrosilylation and final in 
situ charging generated attractive silica shells for the substractive CMY color 
space model.

BACKGROUND: Guideline-based admission therapies for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) significantly improve 30-day survival, but little is known about their 
association with long-term outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the association of 5 AMI admission therapies 
(aspirin, beta-blockers, acute reperfusion therapy, door-to-balloon [D2B] 
time ≤90 min, and time to fibrinolysis ≤30 min) with life expectancy and years 
of life saved after AMI.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a study 
of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for AMI, with 17 years of follow-up. Life 
expectancy and years of life saved after AMI were calculated using Cox 
proportional hazards regression with extrapolation using exponential models.
RESULTS: Survival for recipients and non-recipients of the 5 guideline-based 
therapies diverged early after admission and continued to diverge during 17-year 
follow-up. Receipt of aspirin, beta-blockers, and acute reperfusion therapy on 
admission was associated with longer life expectancy of 0.78 (standard error 
[SE]: 0.05), 0.55 (SE: 0.06), and 1.03 (SE: 0.12) years, respectively. Patients 
receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 min lived 
1.08 (SE: 0.49) years longer than patients with D2B times >90 min, and 
door-to-needle (D2N) times ≤30 min were associated with 0.55 (SE: 0.12) more 
years of life. A dose-response relationship was observed between longer D2B and 
D2N times and shorter life expectancy after AMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-based therapy for AMI admission is associated with both 
early and late survival benefits, and results in meaningful gains in life 
expectancy and large numbers of years of life saved in elderly patients.

OBJECTIVE: Angiogenesis, the process of building complex vascular structures, 
begins with sprout formation on preexisting blood vessels, followed by extension 
of the vessels through proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Based 
on the potential therapeutic benefits of preventing angiogenesis in pathological 
conditions, many studies have focused on the mechanisms of its initiation as 
well as control. However, how the extension of vessels is terminated remains 
obscure. Thus, we investigated the negative regulation mechanism.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We report that increased intracellular calcium can induce 
dephosphorylation of the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. The 
calcium-mediated dephosphorylation was found to be dependent on Tie2-calmodulin 
interaction. The Tyr1113 residue in the C-terminal end loop of the Tie2 kinase 
domain was mapped and found to be required for this interaction. Moreover, 
mutation of this residue into Phe impaired both the Tie2-calmodulin interaction 
and calcium-mediated Tie2 dephosphorylation. Furthermore, expressing a mutant 
Tie2 incapable of binding to calmodulin or inhibiting calmodulin function in 
vivo causes unchecked growth of the vasculature in Xenopus. Specifically, 
knockdown of Tie2 in Xenopus embryo retarded the sprouting and extension of 
intersomitic veins. Although human Tie2 expression in the Tie2-deficient animals 
almost completely rescued the retardation, the Tie2(Y1113F) mutant caused 
overgrowth of intersomitic veins with strikingly complex and excessive branching 
patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent negative 
regulation of Tie2 can be used as an inhibitory signal for vessel growth and 
branching to build proper vessel architecture during embryonic development.
