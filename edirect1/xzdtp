BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that 
vitamin D supplementation reduces cancer mortality by 13%. Vitamin D 
fortification of foods may increase vitamin D levels in a similar manner as 
vitamin D supplementation and could achieve similar reductions in cancer 
mortality. Whereas some European countries already implemented widespread 
fortification of foods with vitamin D, in other countries only few or no foods 
are fortified. In this study, we estimated the reduction in cancer mortality 
presumably already achieved by current fortification policies in 2017 and the 
potential for further reductions if all countries had effective fortification.
METHODS: We reviewed scientific literature, publicly available information, and 
contacted health authorities to obtain information on current vitamin D food 
fortification policies in 34 European countries. Together with country-specific 
cancer death statistics from Eurostat, information on life expectancy, and 
country-specific fortification policies, we used data from studies on 
supplementation and serum 25(OH)D increases and cancer mortality to estimate 
numbers of probably already prevented cancer deaths and numbers of potentially 
further preventable deaths and years of life lost.
RESULTS: Current vitamin D fortification is estimated to prevent approximately 
11,000 in the European Union and 27,000 cancer deaths in all European countries 
considered per year. If all countries considered here would implement adequate 
vitamin D fortification of foods, an estimated additional 129,000 cancer deaths 
(113,000 in the European Union) could be prevented, corresponding to almost 1.2 
million prevented years of life lost (1.0 million in the EU) or approximately 9% 
of cancer deaths (10% in the EU).
INTERPRETATION: Systematic fortification of foods might considerably reduce the 
burden of cancer deaths in Europe.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for mammography screening for breast cancer vary 
across agencies, especially for women aged 40-49. Using artificial Intelligence 
(AI) to read mammography images has been shown to predict breast cancer risk 
with higher accuracy than alternative approaches including polygenic risk scores 
(PRS), raising the question whether AI-based screening is more cost-effective 
than screening based on PRS or existing guidelines. This study provides the 
first evidence to shed light on this important question.
METHODS: This study is a model-based economic evaluation. We used a hybrid 
decision tree/microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of eight 
strategies of mammography screening for women aged 40-49 (screening beyond age 
50 follows existing guidelines). Six of these strategies were defined by 
combinations of risk prediction approaches (AI, PRS or family history) and 
screening frequency for low-risk women (no screening or biennial screening). The 
other two strategies involved annual screening for all women and no screening, 
respectively. Data used to populate the model were sourced from the published 
literature.
RESULTS: Risk prediction using AI followed by no screening for low-risk women is 
the most cost-effective strategy. It dominates (i.e., costs more and generates 
fewer quality adjusted life years (QALYs)) strategies for risk prediction using 
PRS followed by no screening or biennial screening for low-risk women, risk 
prediction using AI or family history followed by biennial screening for 
low-risk women, and annual screening for all women. It also extendedly dominates 
(i.e., achieves higher QALYs at a lower incremental cost per QALY) the strategy 
for risk prediction using family history followed by no screening for low-risk 
women. Meanwhile, it is cost-effective versus no screening, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,755 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk prediction using AI followed by no breast cancer screening for 
low-risk women is the most cost-effective strategy. This finding can be 
explained by AI's ability to identify high-risk women more accurately than PRS 
and family history (which reduces the possibility of delayed breast cancer 
diagnosis) and fewer false-positive diagnoses from not screening low-risk women.

BACKGROUND: A first pilot study showed that an image-guided navigation system 
could improve resection margin rates in locally advanced (LARC) and locally 
recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients. Incremental surgical innovation is 
often implemented without reimbursement consequences, health economic aspects 
should however also be taken into account. This study evaluates the early 
cost-effectiveness of navigated surgery compared to standard surgery in LARC and 
LRRC.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to estimate the expected costs 
and outcomes for navigated and standard surgery. The input parameters were based 
on pilot data from a prospective (navigation cohort n = 33) and retrospective 
(control group n = 142) data. Utility values were measured in a comparable group 
(n = 63) through the EQ5D-5L. Additionally, sensitivity and value of information 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Based on this early evaluation, navigated surgery showed incremental 
costs of €3141 and €2896 in LARC and LRRC. In LARC, navigated surgery resulted 
in 2.05 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) vs 2.02 QALYs for standard surgery. 
For LRRC, we found 1.73 vs 1.67 QALYs respectively. This showed an Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of €136.604 for LARC and €52.510 for LRRC per 
QALY gained. In scenario analyses, optimal utilization rates of the navigation 
technology lowered the ICER to €61.817 and €21.334 for LARC and LRRC. The ICERs 
of both indications were most sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the risk of 
progression in the first year after surgery, the risk of having a positive 
surgical margin, and the costs of the navigation system.
CONCLUSION: Adding navigation system use is expected to be cost-effective in 
LRRC and has the potential to become cost-effective in LARC. To increase the 
probability of being cost-effective, it is crucial to optimize efficient use of 
both the hybrid OR and the navigation system and identify subgroups where 
navigation is expected to show higher effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major shocks in mortality trends in 
many countries. Yet few studies have evaluated the heterogeneity of the 
mortality shocks at the sub-national level, rigorously accounting for the 
different sources of uncertainty.
METHODS: Using death registration data from Belgium, we first assess change in 
the heterogeneity of districts' standardized mortality ratios in 2020, when 
compared to previous years. We then measure the shock effect of the pandemic 
using district-level values of life expectancy, comparing districts' observed 
and projected life expectancy, accounting for all sources of uncertainty 
(stemming from life-table construction at district level and from projection 
methods at country and district levels). Bayesian modelling makes it easy to 
combine the different sources of uncertainty in the assessment of the shock. 
This is of particular interest at a finer geographical scale characterized by 
high stochastic variation in annual death counts.
RESULTS: The heterogeneity in the impact of the pandemic on all-cause mortality 
across districts is substantial: while some districts barely show any impact, 
the Bruxelles-Capitale and Mons districts experienced a decrease in life 
expectancy at birth of 2.24 (95% CI:1.33-3.05) and 2.10 (95% CI:0.86-3.30) 
years, respectively. The year 2020 was associated with an increase in the 
heterogeneity of mortality levels at a subnational scale in comparison to past 
years, measured in terms of both standardized mortality ratios and life 
expectancies at birth. Decisions on uncertainty thresholds have a large bearing 
on the interpretation of the results.
CONCLUSION: Developing sub-national mortality estimates taking careful account 
of uncertainty is key to identifying which areas have been disproportionately 
affected.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates whether lead-time bias contributes to the 
excellent survival of AIS and MIA.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with resected adenocarcinoma from 2008 to 2012. 
Age, sex, smoke history, surgical approach, radiological features, invasive 
stage and postoperative follow-up data were documented. 1:1 PSM was performed to 
balance the influence of sex and smoking status on survival. After matching, the 
average age of the two groups was compared to calculate the lead time of 
diagnosis. The gain in life years for adenocarcinoma diagnosed at pre-/minimally 
invasive stage was estimated by subtracting the "lead time" and "median survival 
year of IAC" from "the life expectancy of AIS/MIA patients" referring to the 
Centre for Health and Information.
RESULTS: There were 124 AIS/MIA patients and 1148 IAC patients. The frequency of 
female and never-smoking patients in AIS/MIA group was much higher than that in 
IAC group. PSM analysis identified 124 patient pairs. No cancer-related death 
and recurrence were observed among AIS/MIA patients 5 years after surgery. For 
IAC patients, the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 73.5% and the median 
survival is 13.5 years. The average age of AIS/MIA group and IAC group are 
53.6 years and 58.2 years, respectively. The lead time between diagnosis of 
AIS/MIA and IAC is 4.6 years. Referring to the Centre for Health and 
Information, the life expectancy of patients with AIS/MIA diagnosed at 
53.6 years old is 28.9 years. With adjustment for the lead time, the gain in 
life years for adenocarcinoma diagnosed at pre-/minimally invasive stage is 
10.8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: With adjustment for the lead time between diagnosis of AIS/MIA and 
IAC, resecting lung adenocarcinoma at pre-/minimally invasive stage can improve 
life expectancy. The excellent survival of AIS/MIA is not lead-time bias.

PURPOSE: The dose-limiting factor of ramucirumab plus docetaxel (RAM + DTX) in 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is febrile neutropenia (FN), 
which has a high incidence in Asians. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim (Peg-G) in patients with NSCLC receiving 
RAM + DTX in Japan.
METHODS: We simulated model patients treated with RAM + DTX in Japan and 
developed a decision-analytical model for patients receiving Peg-G prophylaxis 
or no primary prophylaxis. The expected cost, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each treatment were 
calculated from the perspective of a Japanese healthcare payer. The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at 45,867 United States dollars (USD) 
(5 million Japanese yen) per QALY gained. The probabilities, utility values, and 
other costs were obtained from published sources. Deterministic sensitivity 
analysis (DSA) and probabilistic analysis were conducted to evaluate the effect 
of each parameter and robustness of the base-case results.
RESULTS: The expected cost and QALYs were 20,275 USD and 0.701 for Peg-G 
prophylaxis and 17,493 USD and 0.672 for no primary prophylaxis, respectively. 
The ICER was calculated to be 97,519 USD per QALY gained. The results were most 
sensitive to FN risk with Peg-G. When FN risk with no primary prophylaxis 
exceeded 51% or the cost of Peg-G was less than 649 USD per injection, the ICER 
was below the WTP threshold. The probabilistic analysis revealed a 9.1% 
probability that the ICER was below the WTP threshold.
CONCLUSION: Peg-G is not cost-effective in patients with NSCLC receiving 
RAM + DTX in Japan.

Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of the disease burden attributable to 
ambient PM2.5 across the world is essential for the prevention of related 
diseases, as well as ambient PM2.5 control. Following the framework and 
methodology of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) in 2019, the global, 
regional, and national data on ambient PM2.5-attributable death and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the age-standardized rates of 
mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) were summarized based 
on age, gender, year, location and speciﬁc diseases. We calculated the average 
annual percentage change (AAPC) to depict the secular trends of ASMR and ASDR 
from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the global ambient PM2.5-related deaths and DALYs 
were 4,140,970 and 118.2 million, respectively, with 1,702,150 deaths and 47.5 
million DALYs for females and 2,438,820 deaths and 70.7 million DALYs for male. 
In the 13 level-three causes, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic 
obstructive and pulmonary disease (COPD) were the leading three causes of deaths 
and DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5. The number of global deaths and DALYs 
attributable to ambient PM2.5 has increased by 102.3% and 67.7% from 1990 to 
2019, respectively. However, ASMR and ASDR showed little change. In the 13 
level-three diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke, COPD, diabetes mellitus, 
and lung cancer were the top five contributors to the increase of global deaths 
or DALYs, among which diabetes mellitus had the fastest increase of ASMR and 
ASDR, with AAPC of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.58) and 2.21 (95% CI: 2.15, 2.27), 
respectively. The population attributable fractions (PAF) of causes in ASMR or 
ASDR varied significantly across regions, of which PAF of COPD, stroke and lung 
cancer were the top three. Regarding the GBD region, high PAF mainly occurred in 
North Africa and Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. The age-specific PAFs 
of ischemic heart disease and stroke deaths and DALYs due to ambient PM2.5 were 
negatively correlated with age. ASMR and ASDR of overall PM2.5 related-burden 
showed an inverted "V/U" relationship with the socio-demographic index (SDI). 
The AAPC of ASMR and ASDR of the overall causes showed a strong negative 
correlation with SDI in 2019, especially at the SDI larger than 0.5. The deaths 
and DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5 continued to increase under the context 
of population growth and aging. Decision-makers should consider controlling the 
PM2.5 emission when developing the economy.

Over time, long-term survival has dramatically increased for patients with 
complex congenital heart disease who undergo the Fontan operation. With this 
increased survival, it has become apparent that such a circulation has important 
consequences for other organ systems, particularly the liver and kidney. The 
adverse milieu created by chronic venous hypertension, low cardiac output, and 
an inflammatory state contribute to the pathologic changes observed in the liver 
and kidneys over the long term in Fontan patients. The clinical importance of 
these hepatic and renal comorbidities have only recently begun to be recognized 
in the context of increasing life expectancy in this population. The objectives 
of this review are to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of the Fontan 
circulation and how liver and kidney disease evolve in this setting; to 
summarize the current evidence base as it relates to the diagnostic approach to 
liver and kidney disease in Fontan patients; and to discuss the therapeutic 
approaches to Fontan- associated liver and kidney disease. Given that this is a 
very active area of research in congenital heart disease, we have identified 
knowledge gaps and priority research areas to improve the care of Fontan 
patients. These include establishing the optimal diagnostic tests to detect and 
track liver and kidney disease change over time, determining which treatable 
risk factors contribute to the development of liver and kidney disease, and 
evaluating therapies to prevent or slow progression of liver and kidney disease.

Traditional congenital heart disease (CHD) outcomes include mortality (survival 
to adulthood and life expectancy) as well as cardiac and noncardiac morbidity. 
Strategies to identify and manage sequelae have primarily focused on objective 
data obtained though invasive and noninvasive diagnostic approaches. In 
contrast, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide subjective information, using 
standardized measures, about patients' health and well-being as reported 
directly by patients, without interpretation, interference, or assumptions made 
by clinicians or others. Selection of PRO measures entails thoughtful 
consideration of who the individuals being surveyed are, why assessment is 
occurring (eg, what are the domains of interest; clinical vs research), and what 
processes are in place for acquisition, administration, interpretation, and 
response. In this review, we focus on 3 domains of PROs for pediatric and adult 
patients with Fontan physiology: physical health status, psychological 
functioning, and quality of life. Infants, children, adolescents, and adults 
with CHD face a spectrum of challenges that might influence PROs across the life 
span. In general, patients with Fontan palliation tend to have lower physical 
health status, experience more psychological distress, and have equivalent or 
reduced quality of life compared with healthy peers. Herein, we provide an 
overview of PROs among people with Fontan circulation as a group, yet 
simultaneously emphasize that the optimal way to understand the experiences of 
any individual patient is to ask and listen. We also offer clinical and research 
initiatives to improve the adoption and utility of PROs in CHD settings, which 
show commitment to capturing, understanding, and responding to the patient 
voice.

BACKGROUND: Measuring quality of life is of importance in keratoconus. So far, 
the Keratoconus End-Points Assessment Questionnaire (KEPAQ) is the only 
keratoconus-specific scale to measure emotional well-being along with functional 
compromise in this population. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of clarity 
and standardization as to how KEPAQ scores should be computed and reported. 
There are also no guidelines for interpretation of classification of quality of 
life when using this instrument. The purpose of this study is to provide a 
specific framework on how to grade and classify keratoconus by using the KEPAQ 
and propose an extension of current classification to encompass subjective 
compromise.
METHODS: A group of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of keratoconus underwent 
application of the KEPAQ. First, a Rasch modeling was performed to evaluate the 
psychometric characteristics of both sub-scales of the instrument. Then, a 
linear transformation was performed to turn data into a more relatable scale 
ranging from 0 to 100. Finally, by using Tukey's Hinges, scores of the KEPAQ 
were divided in a 1-to-4 scale, allowing for an easy E&F classification system.
RESULTS: A total of 386 applications of the KEPAQ were included. Analysis 
provided evidence of the KEPAQ being unidimensional, well-fitted to the Rasch 
Model, and provided adequate interval-level scores. Linear transformation 
resulted in a user-friendly final score ranging from 0 to 100, where a higher 
score translates to having a better quality of life. Two methods of easily 
computing final score, one by hand and the other one by an Excel file, were 
constructed. An E&F 1-to-4 classification was proposed, which may work well with 
the current ABCD classification of keratoconus.
CONCLUSIONS: The KEPAQ is a psychometrically robust scale, which confidently 
measures both emotional-related and functional-related quality of life in 
patients with keratoconus. It can be easily computed, and the results are 
interpretable and classified in a manner similar to that used in the ABCD 
keratoconus classification, by adding letters 'E' for emotional and 'F' for 
functional compromise.

BACKGROUND: The combined effects of increased life expectancy and the 
considerable number of persons reaching old age will magnify the dementia 
epidemic in the USA. Demonstration that subclinical atherosclerosis precedes and 
is associated with cognitive impairment suggests a modifiable risk factor for 
age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of this study is 
to determine whether subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid artery 
intima-media thickness (CIMT) is associated with changes in cognitive function 
over time in older adults.
METHODS: This study combined longitudinal data from three clinical trials 
conducted between 2000 and 2013: the B-Vitamin Atherosclerosis Intervention 
Trial (BVAIT), the Women's Isoflavone Soy Health (WISH) trial, and the Early 
versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE). Participants were 
recruited from the general population in the Greater Los Angeles area and were 
free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes; no cognitive or psychiatric 
exclusion criteria were specified. The same standardized protocol for ultrasound 
image acquisition and measurement of CIMT was used in all trials. CIMT 
measurements performed at baseline and 2.5 years were used in these analyses. 
Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and 2.5 years using a battery of 14 
standardized cognitive tests. All clinical trials were conducted at the 
University of Southern California Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Los Angeles, 
and had at least 2.5 years of cognitive follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 308 men and 1187 women, mean age of 61 years, were included 
in the combined longitudinal dataset for the primary analysis. No associations 
were found between CIMT and cognitive function at baseline or at 2.5 years. 
There was a weak inverse association between CIMT measured at baseline and 
change in global cognition assessed over 2.5 years (β (SE) = - 0.056 (0.028) 
units per 0.1 mm CIMT, 95% CI - 0.110, - 0.001, p = 0.046). No associations 
between CIMT at baseline and changes in executive function, verbal memory, or 
visual memory were found.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of healthy older adults, our findings suggest an 
association between subclinical atherosclerosis and change in global cognitive 
function over 2.5 years. Stronger associations were observed longitudinally over 
2.5 years than cross-sectionally. When analysis was stratified by age group (<65 
and ≥65 years old), the inverse association remained statistically significant 
for participants in the older age group. Subclinical atherosclerosis of the 
carotid artery may be a modifiable correlate of cognitive decline in middle and 
older age.

Background Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide 
including Asian countries, surpassing ischemic heart disease. Stroke accounts 
for 10% of global death, of which more than three fourth occur in low- and 
middle-income countries. An exact estimate of the burden of stroke in Nepal is 
not available. Objective To assess the burden of stroke including disability and 
death over time in Nepal and compare it with other South Asian countries. Method 
We retrieved data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global 
Burden of Diseases database of 2017 on stroke deaths, disability-adjusted life 
years, incidence, and prevalence rates, for both genders from Nepal, Bangladesh, 
Pakistan, Bhutan, and India by year. We assessed the trend of deaths and 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to stroke from 1990 to 2017; and the 
contribution of major risk factors to stroke burden in 2017. Result Stroke 
contributed 7.6% of total deaths and 3.5% of total DALYs in Nepal, with a higher 
burden among the male and old age population. Intracerebral hemorrhage was the 
dominant type of stroke in Nepal with the highest proportion of deaths and 
DALYs. Among the South Asian countries, incidence, prevalence, and burden of 
stroke were highest in Bangladesh. Intracerebral hemorrhage contributed the 
highest DALYs in South Asian countries. High systolic blood pressure was 
contributing the maximum DALYs due to stroke in Nepal. Conclusion Hemorrhagic 
stroke causes high mortality and DALYs in Nepal. Most of the burden of stroke is 
attributed to high blood pressure in Nepal.

Background Good governance and leadership are essential to improve healthy life 
expectancy particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study 
aimed to epitomize the challenges and opportunities for leadership and good 
governance for the health system to address non-communicable diseases 
particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Nepal. Objective The objective of 
this study was to understand and document CVD programs and policy formulation 
processes and to identify the government capacity to engage stakeholders for 
planning and implementation purposes. Method A national-level task force was 
formed to coordinate and steer the overall need assessment process. A 
qualitative study design was adopted using "The Health System Assessment 
Approach". Eighteen indicators under six topical areas in leadership and 
governance in cardiovascular health were assessed using desk review and key 
informant interviews. Result Voice and accountability exist in planning for 
health from the local level. The government has shown a strong willingness and 
has a strategy to work together with the private and non-government sectors in 
health however, the coordination has not been effective. There are strong rules 
in place for regulatory quality, control of corruption, and maintaining 
financial transparency. The government frequently relies on evidence generated 
from large-scale surveys for health policy formulation and planning but research 
in cardiovascular health has been minimum. There is a scarcity of cardiovascular 
disease-specific protocols. Conclusion Despite plenty of opportunities, much 
homework is needed to improve leadership and governance in cardiovascular health 
in Nepal. The government needs to designate a workforce for specific programs to 
help monitor the enforcement of health sector regulations, allocate enough 
funding to encourage CVD research, and work towards developing CVD-specific 
guidelines, protocols, and capacity building. KEY WORDS Cardiovascular diseases, 
Governance, Leadership, Needs assessment, Nepal.

Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) is often used on eggs to remove 
microorganisms, but the cuticle will be damaged, causing bacterial invasion and 
deterioration of egg quality during preservation. Therefore, a combination of 
SAEW disinfection with chitosan (CS) and pectin (PT) composite coating (CS + PT) 
was tried in preventing bacterial invasion and prolonging the shelf life of 
eggs. The results showed the order of decontamination effectiveness on 
contaminated eggs was SAEW > Electrolyzed reduced water 
(ERW) + SAEW > ERW > deionized water. The CS + PT coating used on 
SAEW-disinfected eggs inhibits the S. enteritidis invasion (reduced by 63.3%) 
and was successfully used to maintain the quality of eggs (Haugh unit 48.63, 
Weight loss 7.34%, Yolk index 0.29, pH 8.93) after 8 weeks storage at 25 ℃. The 
results revealed that the combination of SAEW and CS + PT was a very promising 
method for egg preservation.

Analysis of demographic data indicates uneven distribution of mortality within a 
year, month, and even week time period. This is of great practical importance 
for the operation of medical institutions, including intensive care units, and 
makes it possible to calculate economic and labor requirements of medical 
institutions. All the above is especially relevant during the era of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Malygin showed the presence of one to two fluctuations per 
week in the mortality of male patients with type 2 diabetes. The height of the 
peaks of such fluctuations is determined, as expected, by the regular parameter 
indicating their position on the axis of lifespan and random parameter 
reflecting adverse effects of external environmental factors on the body, as 
well as the extent of the periodically occurring sharp decrease in the 
nonspecific resistance. This article discusses results of recent research in the 
field of small (semi-weekly, weekly, monthly, and seasonal) fluctuations of 
mortality. Based on a large array of accumulated data, it can be concluded that 
the decrease in seasonal variability of mortality accompanies an increase in the 
life expectancy. Studying characteristics of mortality fluctuations makes it 
possible to move from investigating the impact of biorhythms (Master Clock) on 
the development of acute and chronic phenoptotic processes directly to studying 
the patterns of mortality rhythms themselves (rhythms of phenoptosis).

BACKGROUND: Non-infectious retinal disease, even in the HAART era, continues to 
be one of the most common diagnoses in patients with HIV, with prevalences of up 
to 27% of cases. This study aims to characterize the association between 
demographic variables and their role. As a risk factor for the development of 
non-opportunistic non-infectious retinal disease in patients with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: An integrative review of the literature was carried out according to 
Arksey O'Malley's approach, based on the PICO methodology and following the 
PRISMA recommendations; An exhaustive search was carried out in databases of 
articles that were filtered using established criteria, with their extraction 
and analysis carried out qualitatively.
RESULTS: Ocular manifestations from any cause develop from 35 years of age in 
patients with HIV/AIDS, with the highest risk for age-related macular 
degeneration over the fourth decade of life and for the development of 
neuroretinal disorder on the fifth decade of life; some studies report a slight 
tendency to diagnose macular degeneration in women and those who acquired AIDS 
through sexual contact; data contrasted with increased risk for diagnosing 
neuroretinal disorder in homosexual men who also use intravenous drugs, possibly 
due to oversampling in studies; non-Hispanic whites and African Americans were 
the races most commonly affected by neuroretinal disease; the means between the 
11.3-14.5 years elapsed since the HIV diagnosis were more frequently associated 
with cognitive impairment and both in those with high or low CD4 counts, and in 
patients with high or low viral loads, neuroretinal disease without 
Statistically significant differences. Adherence and early initiation of HAART 
had a modest impact on the development of neuroretinal disease.
DISCUSSION: Even in the HAART era, non-infectious neuroretinal disease and 
cytomegalovirus retinitis remain the most frequent ocular diagnoses, however, 
different studies argue an increase in age-related non-infectious retinal 
diseases in patients with HIV, theories that are may explain by the increase in 
life expectancy, the metabolic effects of HAART itself or the generalized 
pro-inflammatory state in this group of patients, it is essential to recognize 
this new diagnostic challenge in order to direct preventive efforts through the 
use of cost-effective sociodemographic risk predictors towards that 
technological tools for diagnosis and treatment can be targeted.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV/AIDS patients who present at the ophthalmological consultation 
with the suggested sociodemographic predictors have a high risk of visual 
impairment due to non-infectious retinopathy, therefore prevention, diagnosis 
and treatment efforts directed at these diseases should be increased.

BACKGROUND: Desired longevity represents how strongly people esteem possible 
extensions of their own lifetime. The association between desired longevity and 
mortality risk has been reported in only one prospective study, which examined a 
small sample of older participants. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that 
desired longevity at middle-age predicted long-term survival.
METHODS: In the prospective cohort study, residents aged 40-64 years were asked 
how long they would like to live and asked to choose one from three options: 
longer than, as long as, or shorter than the life expectancy. We used Cox 
proportional hazards model to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality according 
to the three groups for desired longevity, treating the "longer than" group as 
the reference. We conducted mediation analysis to investigate the mechanism for 
the association between desired longevity and mortality.
RESULTS: We recruited 39,902 residents to the study. Risk of all-cause mortality 
was significantly higher in the "shorter than" group (HR 1.12; 95% CI, 
1.04-1.21). The association was independent of sex, age, marital status, 
education, medical history, and health status. Regarding cause of death, 
mortality risk of cancer (HR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.29) and suicide (HR 2.15; 95% 
CI, 1.37-3.38) were also higher in the "shorter than" group. The unhealthy 
lifestyle mediated this association with all-cause mortality by 30.4%.
CONCLUSION: Shorter desired longevity was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of all-cause mortality, and mortality from cancer and suicide. 
Lifestyle behaviors particularly mediated this association.

OBJECTIVES: A drug that improves survival and/or disease progression can create 
real option value (ROV)-the additional health gain from future innovations 
enabled by a longer survival. ROV can be a relevant consideration for both 
clinical and payer decision-makers. We aimed to estimate the ex ante ROV for 
first-line (1L) alectinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with 1L alectinib versus 1L 
crizotinib due to potential future second-line (2L) drugs. Transition 
probabilities were derived from the phase 3 trial of 1L alectinib and phase 2 
trial of 2L brigatinib. We identified drugs being studied in phase 2 and 3 
trials in ALK-positive NSCLC at the time of alectinib's 1L approval and 
projected the likelihood and timing of their arrival and their potential 
efficacy based on publicly available data.
RESULTS: The discounted incremental LYs and QALYs for alectinib increased by 
12.9% (95% CR - 2.96%, 34.82%; 1.25 vs. 1.11) and 11.2% (95% CR - 2.14%, 29.29%; 
1.03 vs. 0.92), respectively, after accounting for ROV. The incremental ROV of 
alectinib was sensitive to the projected efficacy of future drugs, uptake level, 
and the hazard ratio of progression-free survival of alectinib (vs. crizotinib).
CONCLUSIONS: Ex ante ROV can be a significant value consideration in therapeutic 
areas with high levels of expected innovation. The potential efficacy of future 
drugs and incremental survival with alectinib at the projected time of arrival 
are important considerations in assessing ROV.
