recommended and may result in higher drug costs and toxicity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of using empiric high-dose 
fluconazole in intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected invasive candidiasis.
DESIGN: Decision analytic model.
TARGET POPULATION: ICU patients with suspected invasive candidiasis.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Low-dose fluconazole (loading dose of 800 mg followed by 400 mg 
daily) vs. high-dose fluconazole (loading dose of 1600 mg followed by 800 mg 
daily). Generic fluconazole costs were used for the analysis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental life expectancy and incremental cost per 
discounted life year (DLY) saved. RESULT OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Based on current 
national levels of fluconazole resistance and ability to correctly identify 
patients with candidemia, high-dose fluconazole was the more effective but more 
expensive treatment strategy. Empiric high-dose fluconazole therapy decreased 
the mortality rate by 0.15% compared to low-dose strategy with a 
cost-effectiveness rate of $55,526 per DLY saved.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Empirical high-dose fluconazole was an 
acceptable treatment strategy (using $100,000 per DLY saved as threshold) unless 
the physical age of an ICU survivor was 66 years or older. Empirical high-dose 
fluconazole was an acceptable treatment strategy using $50,000 per DLY saved 
with minor changes in parameters estimates.
LIMITATIONS: The estimates of our model may not be applicable to all ICU 
patients. Other hospitals with differences in fluconazole resistance, prevalence 
of invasive candidiasis, or duration of fluconazole therapy may produce 
different results.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that empiric high-dose fluconazole therapy 
should reduce the mortality associated with invasive candidiasis at an 
acceptable cost.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model organism to study 
biological processes relevant to a wide variety of human and rodent disease 
systems. Previous studies have suggested that mutants of the 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway show life extension and increased 
stress resistance in various species, including C. elegans, the fruit fly, and 
the mouse. It has recently been shown that the life-extending mutants, including 
the age-1 phosphatidylinositol- 3 OH kinase mutants and the daf-2 insulin-like 
receptor mutants, display improvement in a type of associative learning behavior 
called thermotaxis learning behavior. The age-1 mutant shows a dramatic 
threefold extension of the health-span that ensures thermotaxis learning 
behavior, suggesting strong neuroprotective actions during aging. The age-1 and 
daf-2 mutants show resistance to multiple forms of stress and upregulates the 
genes involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging, heat shock, and P450 
drug-detoxification. The life-extending mutants may confer resistance to various 
stress and diseases in neurons. Therefore, C. elegans provides an emerging 
system for the prevention of age-related deficits in the nervous system and in 
learning behaviors. This article discusses the aging of learning and memory and 
the neuroprotection effects of life-extending mutants on learning behaviors.

BACKGROUND: According to previous studies, the quality of life is usually 
substantially altered in patients who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage of 
an aneurysmal origin. Some studies have attempted to find out which factors 
predict the deterioration in quality of life. Our study will try to describe the 
quality of life of these patients and discover which variables may predict it in 
each of its dimensions.
METHODS: The participants were 70 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage between 15 and 85 years of age. The instrument used to measure the 
quality of life is the SF-36 with its eight dimensions. The predictor variables 
introduced into the multiple linear regressions are neurological condition on 
admission [World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale and Hunt and 
Hess scale], extension of the hemorrhage (Fisher scale), sex, age, physical 
handicaps, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) on release.
RESULTS: The results showed that 42.9% of the patients had a deteriorated 
quality of life after 4 months, and that the most affected dimension was the 
Physical Role (60%). The two factors that predict quality of life are sex and 
physical handicaps. Other factors that intervene are the GOS on release and the 
WFNS.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients who have experienced an aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage show greater difficulty in performing daily activities, and they 
present more depression and anxiety. The absence of handicaps and being male are 
predictor factors for an unaffected quality of life.

A key task for health policymakers is to optimise the outcome of health care 
interventions. The pricing of a new generation of cancer drugs, in combination 
with limited health care resources, has highlighted the need for improved 
methodology to estimate outcomes of different treatment options. Here we 
introduce new general methodology, which for the first time employs continuous 
hazard functions for analysis of survival data. Access to continuous hazard 
functions allows more precise estimations of survival outcomes for different 
treatment options. We illustrate the methodology by calculating outcomes for 
adjuvant treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours with imatinib mesylate, 
which selectively inhibits the activity of a cancer-causing enzyme and is a 
hallmark representative for the new generation of cancer drugs. The calculations 
reveal that optimal drug pricing can generate all win situations that improve 
drug availability to patients, make the most of public expenditure on drugs and 
increase pharmaceutical company gross profits. The use of continuous hazard 
functions for analysis of survival data may reduce uncertainty in health care 
resource allocation, and the methodology can be used for drug price negotiations 
and to investigate health care intervention thresholds. Health policy makers, 
pharmaceutical industry, reimbursement authorities and insurance companies, as 
well as clinicians and patient organisations, should find the methodology 
useful.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of donepezil for mild to moderate Alzheimer's 
disease in Taiwan.

Fuh JL(1), Wang SJ.

Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. jlfuh@vghtpe.gov.tw

BACKGROUND: Donepezil is a drug used for treatment in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Information regarding the cost-effectiveness of this medication 
was previously rare in Asia. We used techniques of decision analysis and 
economic evaluation in conjunction with available local epidemiological and 
clinical data on costs of mild to moderate AD to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of donepezil in Taiwan.
METHODS: A four-state Markov model was built to simulate the disease progression 
of AD patients. Local transition probabilities and costs of different stages 
were from the studies published earlier.
RESULTS: Over a 5-year span, donepezil treatment for mild or moderate AD 
patients is predicted to result in the gain of 0.505 QALYs when comparing to 
usual care, while at the same time reducing the cost by US$7,691. The 
incremental cost was US$3,647 from the payer perspective; thus, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be US$7,226 when considering only the 
medical expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS: Under some assumptions, donepezil treatment might be a cost saving 
strategy for mild to moderate AD patients in Taiwan from a societal perspective. 
It is inconclusive from the payer's part since we still lack a consensus for 
judging the cost-effectiveness of a new health care technology.

The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging proposes that aging takes place 
because natural selection favors genes that confer benefit early on life at the 
cost of deterioration later in life. This theory predicts that genes that impact 
development would play a key role in shaping adult lifespan. To better 
understand the link between development and adult lifespan, we examined the 
genes previously known to be essential for development. From a pool of 57 genes 
that cause developmental arrest after inhibition using RNA interference, we have 
identified 24 genes that extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans when 
inactivated during adulthood. Many of these genes are involved in regulation of 
mRNA translation and mitochondrial functions. Genetic epistasis experiments 
indicate that the mechanisms of lifespan extension by inactivating the 
identified genes may be different from those of the insulin/insulin-like growth 
factor 1 (IGF-1) and dietary restriction pathways. Inhibition of many of these 
genes also results in increased stress resistance and decreased fecundity, 
suggesting that they may mediate the trade-offs between somatic maintenance and 
reproduction. We have isolated novel lifespan-extension genes, which may help 
understand the intrinsic link between organism development and adult lifespan.

Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong. alice.achong@cityu.edu.hk

With the ageing of the global population, the wellbeing of older people in 
different parts of the world merits special attention. However, recent findings 
on certain aspects of the psychosocial health of the elderly are far from 
reassuring. The first problem is the inconsistency in psychosocial indicators, 
which give simultaneous high life satisfaction scores and high suicide rates. 
The second problem is the significant weakening of the social support network of 
the elderly. This article analyses the service and policy implications of these 
two problems. Suggestions are then made on the role of social workers in 
promoting the psychosocial health of the elderly at different levels of 
intervention, which include the individual level, the family and social network 
level, the community level and the international level.

Stressing the role of FoxO proteins in lifespan and disease.

van der Horst A(1), Burgering BM.

University Medical Center Utrecht, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Members of the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FoxO) have 
important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance and 
probably lifespan. The activity of FoxOs is tightly regulated by 
post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation and 
ubiquitylation. Several of the enzymes that regulate the turnover of these 
post-translational modifications are shared between FoxO and p53. These 
regulatory enzymes affect FoxO and p53 function in an opposite manner. This 
shared yet opposing regulatory network between FoxOs and p53 may underlie a 
'trade-off' between disease and lifespan.

OBJECTIVE: To carry out estimations of the burden of disease for 129 causes in 
order to identify health priorities in the different geographic regions of the 
country and to present comparative data between 1995 and 2000.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Indicators such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and disability adjusted life expectancy (DALE) were analyzed for the population 
covered by IMSS in 1995 and 2000; for both years, the methodology proposed by 
the Burden of Disease Worldwide Study was applied. Data corresponding to 1995 
were analyzed in 1997, while data corresponding to 2000 were analyzed in 2001. 
The comparative study was carried out in 2006 by IMSS, Mexico.
RESULTS: The higher proportion of DALYs was due to chronic diseases, although 
the 2000 rate is 1.5 times higher than that of 1995. Priorities that were 
identified were diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiopathy, and cerebrovascular 
disease, with a loss that is mainly accounted for by premature death, as well as 
by diseases related to disability with an important burden of disease, such as 
AIDS or depression. Epidemiological backlogs can still be observed.
CONCLUSION: The population covered by IMSS is still in a phase of epidemiologic 
transition, favoring polarization in health conditions. Health policies need to 
be directed toward bringing about an improved response and reversing the trend 
in diseases that represent an institutional risk for the financing of health 
care.

Reduced oxidant stress and extended lifespan in mice exposed to a low glycotoxin 
diet: association with increased AGER1 expression.

Aging is accompanied by increased oxidative stress (OS) and accumulation of 
advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGE formation in food is 
temperature-regulated, and ingestion of nutrients prepared with excess heat 
promotes AGE formation, OS, and cardiovascular disease in mice. We hypothesized 
that sustained exposure to the high levels of pro-oxidant AGEs in normal diets 
(Reg(AGE)) contributes to aging via an increased AGE load, which causes AGER1 
dysregulation and depletion of anti-oxidant capacity, and that an isocaloric, 
but AGE-restricted (by 50%) diet (Low(AGE)), would decrease these abnormalities. 
C57BL6 male mice with a life-long exposure to a Low(AGE) diet had higher than 
baseline levels of tissue AGER1 and glutathione/oxidized glutathione and reduced 
plasma 8-isoprostanes and tissue RAGE and p66(shc) levels compared with mice 
pair-fed the regular (Reg(AGE)) diet. This was associated with a reduction in 
systemic AGE accumulation and amelioration of insulin resistance, albuminuria, 
and glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, lifespan was extended in Low(AGE) mice, 
compared with Reg(AGE) mice. Thus, OS-dependent metabolic and end organ 
dysfunction of aging may result from life-long exposure to high levels of 
glycoxidants that exceed AGER1 and anti-oxidant reserve capacity. A reduced AGE 
diet preserved these innate defenses, resulting in decreased tissue damage and a 
longer lifespan in mice.

Since 1962, desferrioxamine (deferoxamine, DFO) has been utilized for the 
treatment of secondary hemosiderosis. For about 30 years, DFO therapy has been 
performed as nightly continuous subcutaneous infusion. About 20 years ago, the 
first oral iron chelator (deferiprone, DFP) was presented. Concerns about 
potential side effects were responsible for the late acceptance and license of 
this drug which is limited to the use as second-line therapy for patients with 
thalassemia major. During recent years, chelation therapy and its evaluation 
started to progress rapidly. Clinical research and drug development as well as 
the introduction of new methods for the assessment of iron overload contributed 
to these advances. By using cardiac T2 (*) MRI it was possible to examine the 
specific effect of a chelator on myocardial siderosis. Clinical studies using 
this method indicated superiority of DFP compared to DFO with respect to the 
treatment of myocardial siderosis. Several retrospective and first prospective 
clinical trials seem to confirm this observation. In parallel, treatment 
strategies based on the combination of DFO and DFP have been developed. Using 
both drugs simultaneously or sequentially, additive and synergistic effects 
contribute to the fast elimination of iron from different organs at risk for 
siderotic damage. Deferasirox (DSX) is a recently developed oral chelator which 
shows good efficacy and tolerability in patients with transfusional 
hemosiderosis due to various underlying disorders. Long-term studies will define 
the future importance of DSX for iron chelation treatment. For the first time, 
there is a choice between three commercially available chelating agents for 
patients with transfusional iron overload. This will allow a highly effective, 
individually tailored treatment hopefully leading to a fundamental improvement 
of patients' life expectancy and quality.

Can hyperbaric oxygen be used as adjunctive heart failure therapy through the 
induction of endogenous heat shock proteins?

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition that is expected to increase in 
incidence along with increased life expectancy and an aging population. As the 
incidence of HF increases, the cost to national healthcare budgets is expected 
to run into the billions. The costs of lost productivity and increased social 
reliance on state support must also be considered. Recently, acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) has come to be seen as the major contributing factor to HF. 
Although thrombolysis may restore coronary perfusion after an AMI, it may also 
introduce ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI). In an attempt to ameliorate 
sustained protein damage caused by IRI, endogenous chaperone proteins known as 
heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced as a consequence of the stress of IRI. 
Recently, hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to induce the production of HSPs in 
noncardiac tissue, with a resultant protective effect. This current opinion 
review article suggests a possible role for hyperbaric oxygen, as a 
technologically modern drug, in augmenting the induction of endogenous HSPs to 
repair and improve the function of failing hearts that have been damaged by AMI 
and IRI. In addition, this simple, safe, noninvasive drug may prove useful in 
easing the economic burden of HF on already overextended health resources.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a generalised autoimmune disease, causing 
morbidity and a reduced life expectancy, especially in patients with rapidly 
progressive diffuse cutaneous SSc. As no proven treatment exists, autologous 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is employed as a new therapeutic 
strategy in patients with a poor prognosis. This study reports the effects on 
survival, skin and major organ function of HSCT in patients with severe diffuse 
cutaneous SSc.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 26 patients were evaluated. Peripheral blood 
stem cells were collected using cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) and rHu G-CSF (5 to 10 
microg/kg/day) and were reinfused after positive CD34+ selection. For 
conditioning, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg was used.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.3 (1-7.5) years, 81% (n = 21/26) of the 
patients demonstrated a clinically beneficial response. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimated survival at 5 years was 96.2% (95% CI 89-100%) and at 7 years 84.8% 
(95% CI 70.2-100%) and event-free survival, defined as survival without 
mortality, relapse or progression of SSc, resulting in major organ dysfunction 
was 64.3% (95% CI 47.9-86%) at 5 years and 57.1% (95% CI 39.3-83%) at 7 years.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that autologous HSCT in selected patients with 
severe diffuse cutaneous SSc results in sustained improvement of skin thickening 
and stabilisation of organ function up to 7 years after transplantation.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta (TRTA) is a 
life-threatening condition usually caused by deceleration mechanism following 
vehicle accidents.
OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with the conventional surgical treatment of 
TRTA and its long-term results.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed five patients assisted in our Service between 
1990 to 2006. Four of them underwent the conventional surgical treatment and the 
remaining patient was submitted to an endovascular approach, by other surgeon 
due to high-risk comorbidities. We evaluated the perioperative morbity and 
mortality, as well as the long-term results.
RESULTS: All the four cases were male, aged between 21 and 54 years old. Three 
patients were victims of vehicle accidents and one patient reported a fall from 
a stair. Two patients were operated on in the acute fase of TRTA (5 and 17 days) 
and another two patients had delayed treatment (4 months and 10 years later). No 
death or permanent neurologic deficits were noticed. One patient had temporary 
parestesias of lower limbs with complete recover in three weeks. The follow-up 
duration was one to 16 years; no deaths, reinterventions or other complications 
were observed.
CONCLUSION: Although the small number of patients of the present series, we 
would like to stress the quality of long-term results of the surgical management 
of TRTA, undertaken in young patients, with a long-life expectancy.

A simulation model adopting a health system perspective showed population-based 
screening with DXA, followed by alendronate treatment of persons with 
osteoporosis, or with anamnestic fracture and osteopenia, to be cost-effective 
in Swiss postmenopausal women from age 70, but not in men.
INTRODUCTION: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population-based 
screen-and-treat strategy for osteoporosis (DXA followed by alendronate 
treatment if osteoporotic, or osteopenic in the presence of fracture), compared 
to no intervention, from the perspective of the Swiss health care system.
METHODS: A published Markov model assessed by first-order Monte Carlo simulation 
was refined to reflect the diagnostic process and treatment effects. Women and 
men entered the model at age 50. Main screening ages were 65, 75, and 85 years. 
Age at bone densitometry was flexible for persons fracturing before the main 
screening age. Realistic assumptions were made with respect to persistence with 
intended 5 years of alendronate treatment. The main outcome was cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In women, costs per QALY were Swiss francs (CHF) 71,000, CHF 35,000, 
and CHF 28,000 for the main screening ages of 65, 75, and 85 years. The 
threshold of CHF 50,000 per QALY was reached between main screening ages 65 and 
75 years. Population-based screening was not cost-effective in men.
CONCLUSION: Population-based DXA screening, followed by alendronate treatment in 
the presence of osteoporosis, or of fracture and osteopenia, is a cost-effective 
option in Swiss postmenopausal women after age 70.

The effects of musically-induced positive and anxious mood on explicit 
alcohol-related cognitions (alcohol expectancy strength) in 47 undergraduate 
students who consume alcohol either to enhance positive mood states (for 
enhancement motives) or to cope with anxiety (for anxiety-related coping 
motives) were investigated. Pre- and post-mood induction, participants completed 
the emotional reward and emotional relief subscales of the Alcohol Craving 
Questionnaire - Now. The hypothesis that anxiety-related coping motivated 
drinkers in the anxious mood condition (but not those in the positive mood 
condition) would exhibit increases in strength of explicit emotional relief 
alcohol expectancies after the mood induction was supported. An additional, 
unanticipated finding was that enhancement-motivated drinkers in the anxious 
condition also showed significant increases in strength of explicit emotional 
relief (but not emotional reward) alcohol expectancies. The hypothesis that 
enhancement-motivated (but not anxiety-related coping motivated) participants 
would exhibit increases in explicit emotional reward expectancies following 
exposure to the positive mood induction procedure was not supported. Taken 
together with past research findings, the current results highlight the 
importance of distinguishing between subtypes of negative affect (i.e., anxious 
and depressed affect) in exploring the affective antecedents of explicit alcohol 
outcome expectancies.

Birth-spacing patterns in Huaning County, Yunnan Province, PRC: is the adoption 
of a small family norm sustainable?

Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. petra.lofstedt@ki.se

China's family planning programs have emphasized delayed marriage and longer 
spacing between births. Since 1970, the fertility has declined from 6 to 1.8 
births and the mean age at first marriage has gone up but the recommended 
spacing intervals have not been fully realized. Despite the fertility decline it 
is being debated among scholars whether China has completed a sustainable 
demographic transition or not, especially in rural areas. The aim of this study 
was to analyze trends in the timing and patterns of marriage and childbearing in 
relation to successive family planning policies. A cluster random sample of 
1,336 women aged 15-64 at the time of the survey (2000) was selected in one 
rural county in Yunnan province. Life-table techniques were used to analyze the 
cumulative proportion of women marrying and having a certain number of births. 
Cox's hazard regression model was used to estimate the effects of various 
covariates on the "hazard" for a woman to have a second birth. Our findings 
demonstrate how childbearing patterns have changed in the direction of delayed 
marriage, a decreased interval between first marriage and first child, and 
significantly longer spacing between the first and second child. This 
transformation of childbearing patterns corresponds well with the requirements 
of the policies. Considering the characteristics of Yunnan, it seems likely that 
the changing fertility behavior has been more influenced by a strictly enforced 
family planning policy than by societal changes leading to the adoption of a 
new, smaller family norm.

AIMS: The pattern of mortality among many groups of indigenous people has been 
shown to be disadvantageous in comparison with the general population. Knowledge 
regarding causes of death among the Sami population in the northern part of 
Norway is limited. The Sami constitute an ethnic minority whose lifestyle 
diverges from that of the rest of the population.
METHODS: A cohort of 19,801 persons of Sami origin was followed up to evaluate 
specific causes of mortality during the period 1970-98. Standardized mortality 
rates (SMR) were calculated using the rural population of the three Norwegian 
counties included in the study as a reference population.
RESULTS: Among Sami, 5,955 total deaths were observed, as opposed to 5,537 
expected (SMR = 1.08). For both Sami women and men a significantly higher SMR 
for cerebrovascular diseases was found, which was more pronounced for women. For 
Sami men, an excess SMR for violent death was observed (SMR 1.32, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.20-1.46); this was highest among Sami men living in a 
reindeer-breeding family. For both genders, mortality from all malignant 
neoplasms combined was lower than in the reference population. SMRs were 0.86 
(95% CI 0.79-0.94) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.80-0.99) for men and women, respectively. 
Low SMRs were also observed for chronic liver diseases, 0.18 (95% CI 0.02-0.63) 
and 0.12 (95% CI 0.00-0.68) for Sami men and women, respectively. To be a member 
of a reindeer breeding household appeared to offer protection from mortality 
caused by circulatory system diseases in men, especially mortality from 
ischaemic heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The total mortality in the North Norway Sami population, an ethnic 
minority in Norway, was slightly higher when compared with a regional reference 
population. The differences observed when evaluating mortality by diagnosis 
might be due to lifestyle, diet, psychosocial, and/or genetic factors.

Child health in Greenland.

Author information:
(1)District Medical Clinic, Nuuk, Greenland. niclasen@greennet.gl

AIM: To review the knowledge on child health and child health problems in 
Greenland.
METHOD: The review was based on theses, national statistics, national and 
international reports, and a search in Pub Med, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and 
WHOLIB databases from 1985 to 2005. The resulting articles were sorted by topic, 
type, quality of study, and relevance for child health today, providing 47 
articles.
RESULTS: Children in Greenland have become taller and have improved their 
general health. The morbidity found in Greenlandic children is similar to that 
found elsewhere even though the magnitude of problems might differ. The child 
mortality is relatively high and unevenly distributed. The acute disease pattern 
is dominated by infections, mostly airway infections. Otitis and its sequelae is 
a problem. An increase in chronic conditions such as atopy, asthma, obesity, and 
disabilities has taken place. Overweight and obesity have tripled in 20 years 
and are a health threat as well as constituting negative health behaviour. 
Social ill health, socioeconomic inequity, and sociocultural changes also 
influence health but their consequences are not well investigated in children.
CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high child mortality but the same morbidity pattern as 
in other Western societies was found. Negative health behaviour is frequent in 
schoolchildren. The influence of rapid cultural changes, and familial and 
societal factors related to social ill health, together with socioeconomic 
inequity, are of major importance to the health of children in Greenland. More 
accurate data on child health are necessary in the future to secure better 
prioritization. It is suggested to construct a set of reliable indicators of 
child health in Greenland to monitor the health of children on a national and 
regional basis.

Evidence-based recommendations concerning how to discuss dying, life expectancy, 
and likely future symptoms with patients with a limited life expectancy and 
their families are lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to review 
studies regarding prognostic/end-of-life communication with adult patients in 
the advanced stages of a life-limiting illness and their caregivers. Relevant 
studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified by searching computerized 
databases up to November 2004. One hundred twenty-three studies met the criteria 
for the full review, and 46 articles reported on patient/caregiver preferences 
for content, style, and timing of information. The majority of the research was 
descriptive. Although there were individual differences, patients/caregivers in 
general had high levels of information need at all stages of the disease process 
regarding the illness itself, likely future symptoms and their management, and 
life expectancy and information about clinical treatment options. Patient and 
caregiver information needs showed a tendency to diverge as the illness 
progressed, with caregivers needing more and patients wanting less information. 
Patients and caregivers preferred a trusted health professional who showed 
empathy and honesty, encouraged questions, and clarified each individual's 
information needs and level of understanding. In general, most 
patients/caregivers wanted at least some discussion of these topics at the time 
of diagnosis of an advanced, progressive, life-limiting illness, or shortly 
after. However, they wanted to negotiate the content and extent of this 
information.

According to the disposable soma theory, a cost for reproduction could exist in 
human beings and other species and, thus, longevity could decrease when women 
have a higher number of children. The purpose of this article is to review the 
evidence in populations living or not living under natural fertility conditions, 
i.e. when fertility is near its biological maximum. The results indicate that in 
natural fertility conditions longevity does not decrease when the number of 
children increases but, in modern populations, mortality could slightly increase 
when women have more than ca 5 children. Complete data for these modern cohorts 
will tell us, one day, whether these results are still observed when the 
variable of interest is longevity and not only mortality.

OBJECTIVE: The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines remains a key problem in 
patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). With regard to the actual 
long-term prognosis of aggressive NHL, the development of cardioprotective 
strategies is mandatory for these patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis was 
carried out to determine the potential economic profile of dexrazoxane or 
liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in patients with aggressive NHL treated with a 
CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) as 
first-line therapy.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model described clinical events and economic 
consequences for theoretical patients who were to receive eight consecutive 
cycles of a CHOP regimen containing 50 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin as first-line 
chemotherapy. The timeframe of the model was the patient's lifetime. The 
probabilities were related to the cumulative dose of doxorubicin and age. The 
study was carried out from the perspective of the French healthcare system. 
Patients entered the model at 'choose' node: no cardioprotection versus 
cardioprotection with dexrazoxane or liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin. The 
model was based on a retrospective epidemiological study and on published data. 
The clinical end-point was life expectancy. Direct medical costs related to the 
cardioprotection and the treatment of congestive heart failure were considered. 
Monetary values for French prices in the year 2002 were used. Several univariate 
sensitivity analyses were carried out with varying clinical and economic 
parameters.
RESULTS: Per 100 patients, the two cardioprotective strategies provided similar 
benefits that were estimated as 24.5 and 13.4 life-years in 60- and 40-year-old 
patients, respectively. The cost per life-year saved with dexrazoxane was 
estimated as euro6931 and euro15 599 in 60- and 40-year-old patients, 
respectively, and euro22 940 and euro44 982, respectively, with 
liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin. Several sensitivity analyses showed the 
robustness of the model.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest the potential clinical and economic usefulness 
of cardioprotective therapies in patients with aggressive NHL. Prospective 
studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet hydrochloride-based medical therapy in the 
management of hyperparathyroidism in ESRD: a cost utility analysis.

BACKGROUND: Previously, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with 
uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism had few options other than parathyroidectomy, 
which was reserved for patients refractory to medical therapy. Newer 
calcimimetic agents, such as cinacalcet, may be an alternative, but raise the 
possibility of indefinite medical treatment that also would increase costs.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost utility analysis.
SETTING & POPULATION: Base case consisted of prevalent adult US patients with 
ESRD refractory to management with standard medical therapy. Characteristics 
were obtained from patients who underwent parathyroidectomy in 2001, and, for 
purposes of comparison, patients in whom cinacalcet was used were assigned 
similar characteristics. All data came from preexisting literature and trials or 
from US Renal Data System analysis files.
INTERVENTION: Use of cinacalcet hydrochloride versus parathyroidectomy.
PERSPECTIVE & TIME FRAME: Medicare and societal costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years from the date of parathyroidectomy or use of cinacalcet followed up 
for 2 years, respectively.
MODEL & OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were cost (measured in US dollars) and cost 
utility measured using cost per quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: At base-case surgical and drug costs, surgical and drug success rates, 
complication rates/costs, and benefit from correction of hyperparathyroidism, 
parathyroidectomy was found to be both less expensive and more cost-effective at 
7.25 +/- 0.25 months. Parathyroidectomy became more cost-effective at 15.28 to 
16.32 months at the upper limit of sensitivity analysis, when drug/surgical 
costs and success/complication rates/costs were maximally weighted to favor 
cinacalcet-based medical therapy.
LIMITATIONS: We assumed current costs of both cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy 
and assumed cinacalcet use would be indefinite.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ESRD with uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism who 
are good candidates for either drug therapy or surgery, cinacalcet hydrochloride 
is the most cost-effective modality if the patient is to remain on dialysis 
therapy for 7.25 +/- 0.25 months. Cinacalcet may be more optimal if used in 
patients who have high risk of mortality or who would expect to receive a kidney 
transplant quickly. For other subgroups, parathyroidectomy dominated.

llschl@yahoo.com.cn

Statistics from the National Population Census of China revealed a significant 
increase in the Chinese population, from 590 million in 1953 to 1.26 billion in 
2000. The average life expectancy increased to 71.4 years in 2000 compared with 
the expectancy of 68.6 years a decade before. World Health Organization 
statistics on the death rate for total cardiovascular disease, coronary heart 
disease, and stroke in men and women aged 35-74 years revealed discrepancies 
between rural and urban parts of China. The China Multicenter Collaborative 
Study of Cardiovascular Epidemiology indicated that cardiovascular disease was 
the major cause of death for both men and women, with stroke accounting for over 
40% of deaths. Ischemia was shown to be the most common subtype of stroke in 
both sexes. Smoking was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 
The World Health Organization reported that the death rate attributable to 
tobacco was 6.0% worldwide and 9.2% in China in 1990. The latter is projected to 
reach 16.6% by 2020. In China, the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus, the two key risk factors of cardiovascular disease, have also 
increased significantly in the past 20 years. In addition, elevated blood 
pressure and plasma cholesterol were two important determinants of increased 
cardiovascular disease in eastern Asia. These studies indicate that an 
integrated management of comprehensive risk is urgently required to address 
China's increasing cardiovascular disease burden.

BACKGROUND: When conservative management fails in patients with chronic spinal 
cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic bowel dysfunction, clinicians have to choose 
from a variety of treatment options which include colostomy, ileostomy, Malone 
anterograde continence enema (MACE) and sacral anterior root stimulator (SARS) 
implantation. This study employed a decision analysis to examine the optimal 
treatment for bowel management of young individuals with chronic refractory 
constipation in the setting of chronic SCI.
METHODS: A decision analysis was created to compare the four surgical strategies 
using baseline analysis, one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses, 'worst 
scenario' and 'best scenario' sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was the primary 
outcome.
RESULTS: The baseline analysis indicated that patients who underwent the MACE 
procedure had the highest QALE value compared with the other interventions. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust.
CONCLUSION: The MACE procedure may provide the best long-term outcome in terms 
of the probability of improving bowel function, reducing complication rates and 
the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia, and being congruent with patients' 
preferences. The analysis was sensitive to changes in assumptions about quality 
of life/utility, and thus the results could change if more specific estimates of 
utility became available.
