The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence, clinical characteristics and 
age of onset of allergic sensitization and clinical symptoms in a sample of 
atopic elders living in Campania region area (Southern Italy). Fourteen Allergy 
units or Centres examined a total of 462 patients. In this context 215 (46.53%) 
had positive skin prick tests (SPTs) to at least one allergen and were diagnosed 
with respiratory allergy. Parietaria represents the most common sensitizing 
agent in elders living in Campania region, followed by dust mites, grass pollen 
and Olea europaea. A relatively high percentage of atopic subjects suffered from 
respiratory symptoms at a fairly advanced age, namely 8.3% at 60-64 years, 10.2% 
at 65-70 and 5.7% at > 70 years. In conclusion, the prevalence and clinical 
significance of airway allergic sensitization in the elderly living in Campania 
region is more significant than expected in latter stages of life. Physicians 
should not neglect the role of atopy as a risk factor for the onset of allergic 
respiratory symptoms even in elderly patients.

PURPOSE: To evaluate costs of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) vs. intravitreal 
ranibizumab (IVR) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
DESIGN: A Markov-style model of cost-effectiveness and cost utility.
PARTICIPANTS: There were no participants.
METHODS: Based on results from Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) 
Network Protocol S, we performed a Markov-style analysis to generate the total 
2-year costs for each treatment arm. The cost per line-year saved and cost 
utility were calculated based on the estimated life years remaining. Both 
treatment arms were assumed to result in 9 lines of vision saved in 20% of 
patients. Medicare reimbursement data were acquired to determine costs, which 
were then separately calculated for practice settings of a hospital-based 
facility as the highest end of the cost range and a nonfacility in the same 
geographic area as the lowest end. Cost parameters for a prototypical patient's 
life expectancy also were modeled and calculated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inputed cost of therapy, cost per line saved, cost per 
line-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: When PRP was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility 
setting was $13 053, with cost per line saved $7252, cost per line-year $240, 
and cost per QALY $7988. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 21% 
lower. When IVR was the primary treatment, the 2-year cost in the facility 
setting was $30 328, cost per line saved was $16 849, cost per line-year $575, 
and cost per QALY $19 150. In the nonfacility setting costs were approximately 
15% lower. Extrapolation to lifetime therapy yielded the cost per QALY with PRP 
treatment of $14 219 to $24 005 and with IVR of $138 852 to $164 360. Cost 
utility for PRP would be 85% lower than IVR in the facility setting and 90% 
lower than IVR in the nonfacility setting.
CONCLUSIONS: PRP compared with IVR as primary treatment for PDR is less 
expensive over 2 years, but both fall well below the accepted cost per QALY 
upper limit. However, over an average lifetime, the cost differential between 
PRP and IVR increases, and IVR therapy may exceed the typical accepted limit of 
cost per QALY.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of oral cancer is high in Hungary.
AIM: To study the cost-effectiveness of potential oral cancer screening in 
Hungary.
METHOD: Three strategies were compared: no introduction of screening, organized 
yearly screening for 40-year-old males in general medical practise, and 
opportunistic screening of high risk 40-year-old males in primary care. Local 
estimates of health utilities and costs of each health state and of the 
screening programmes were identified. The main outcomes were total costs, 
quality adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Depending on the efficacy of the treatments of precancerous lesions and 
the participation rate, screening strategies are cost-effective over a 15-20 
year time course. The opportunistic screening of high risk people is more 
cost-effective than the other strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic screening of high risk people would be cost-effective 
in Hungary. The uncertainty about the efficacy of the treatments of precancerous 
lesions requires more research to support evidence based health policy making.

PURPOSE: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can treat obesity related 
comorbidities and can prolong life expectancy. It remains unclear whether this 
type of surgery is also indicated in obese patients with advanced age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective monocentric study, we investigated 
the morbidity and outcomes of weight and metabolic control of bariatric surgery 
in patients older than 60 years and compared these findings with those of 
younger patients.
RESULTS: At 18 months after RY gastric bypass, weight losses of respectively 
30 ± 11% and 34 ± 9% of total initial body weight were measured in the older and 
younger patients (p < 0.05). After 12 months, HbA1c dropped below 6.5% in 89% of 
patients younger and in 81% of patients older than 60 (p = 0.11). There was no 
mortality in either group, but there were significantly more complications and 
there was a longer hospital stay in the older patients.
CONCLUSION: RY gastric bypass comes with a significantly higher morbidity and 
hospital stay in older patients, but weight loss and improvement of DM are 
similar as in the younger patients.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disorders in the Caucasian 
population, with estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 patients worldwide. Even 
if improved diagnostics and clinical management have led to an increased life 
expectancy, CF still remains a disease that significantly impacts patients' life 
in terms of symptoms, daily functioning, psychological morbidity and health 
related quality of life. Available data suggest that symptoms of anxiety and 
depression, such as in other chronic conditions, are common features in CF 
patients and in their caregivers, with a significant impact on disease outcomes. 
In this review we analyze and discuss the findings of The International 
Depression and Anxiety Epidemiological Study (TIDES), recently published on 
Thorax. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in a large population of adolescents and adults with CF 
and in parents of children with CF, across eight European countries and the USA. 
The TIDES provides useful insights about the psychological/psychiatric 
comorbidities in CF and its conclusions are absolutely shareable. Nevertheless 
some doubts remain on the methods and the tools. Further investigation and 
understanding of anxiety and depression in CF (in terms of prevalence, 
association with clinical, psychological and socio-cultural factors) is 
necessary and evidence is crescent that a global and multidisciplinary approach 
is wanted.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease has become an increasing problem in the 
aging population of the western world with a prevalence of 10-14%. This will 
result in a growing group of nonagenarians being referred to vascular surgeons, 
with an estimated growth of 2.5 times the number of nonagenarians between 2015 
and 2040. Outcome results of nonagenarians suffering from critical limb ischemia 
(CLI) are scarce, which can cause difficulties in choosing superior therapy 
options. We propose that the life expectancy of nonagenarians suffering CLI 
compared to the overall population of nonagenarians is valuable information 
required in clinical decision-making.
METHODS: Between January 2012 and October 2015, all patients suffering from CLI 
were retrospectively reviewed in the Amphia Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands. 
Patients aged ≥90 years at admission were exclusively included. The main outcome 
result of this study is the life expectancy of nonagenarians suffering from CLI. 
Closely related to life expectancy is the primary end point of mortality. 
Secondary end points were adverse events, reoperations, and limb salvage.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were included in this study of which 27 were 
women. The median age was 92 years. Conservative therapy was performed in 61% of 
the patients. Based on 24 deaths (of which 19 were women), the mortality rate 
ratio of the study group relative to the Dutch population was 3.13 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 2.00-4.66; P < 0.000001), adjusted for age and gender. 
Life expectancy in years of the total Dutch population at age 90 years in 2013 
was 3.83 for men and 4.54 for women in contrast to, respectively, 1.23 (95% CI, 
0.50-5.69) and 2.70 (95% CI, 1.76-3.74) years in our patient group.
CONCLUSIONS: CLI is a severe disease in nonagenarians with a dreadful life 
expectancy of 1.23 and 2.7 years for men and women, respectively, corresponding 
with an age- and gender-adjusted mortality rate ratio of 3.13 relative to the 
Dutch population. Individual factors such as preoperative status, arterial 
occlusive lesion, and especially predicted postoperative quality of life are 
important parameters in clinical decision-making. Results of conservative 
therapy might be acceptable in selected patients, but more focus on quality of 
life is needed to be conclusive.

Patients harboring stage IV non-small cell lung cancer represent a heterogeneous 
population with limited life expectancy. Targeted chemotherapy and immunotherapy 
have improved median survival for a minority of patients. A subset of patients 
with solitary foci of metastatic disease appears to have improved survival 
compared to others with stage IV NSCLC. The role of aggressive local control 
with curative intent for all disease sites in synchronous oligometastatic 
disease lacks randomized data; however, published retrospective series from 
single institutions suggest improved survival in highly selected patients 
(11-30%, 5-year survival) with low morbidity and mortality < 2%.

This work was aimed at evaluating Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: 
Calliphoridae) life cycle, life tables, and reproductive and population 
parameters. This species is a necrophagous, synanthropic, cosmopolitan fly with 
broad distribution in the Neotropical region. Six successive generations from 
adult specimens collected in Bogotá, Colombia, were analyzed in laboratory 
conditions. The fly's life cycle was evaluated, using a natural diet of pig's 
liver (L) and two artificial diets-milk powder and egg (ME) and powdered liver 
(PL). The species' longest life cycle duration (in days), from egg to pupa, was 
obtained with the ME diet (24.6 ± 6.7) whereas the lowest value was recorded 
with the L diet (18.8  ±  3.6). Female adult forms achieved high longevity 
values, this being highest in ME (102.8  ±  3.6). The most efficient diets (L 
and ME) led to the following average reproductive and population values: 226.2 
and 465.4 net reproductive rate (Ro), 22.2 and 47.1 cohort generation time (Tc), 
0.24 and 0.13 intrinsic population growth rate (rm), and 1.27 and 1.13 finite 
rate of increase (λ). The set of results (in terms of relatively high average 
values concerning the biological characteristics analyzed) showed the species' 
adaptability to the environmental and nutritional conditions established in a 
laboratory setting, thereby enabling their colonization.

Hepatitis A vaccination stimulates memory cells to produce an anamnestic 
response. In this study, we used a mathematical model to examine how long-term 
immune memory might convey additional protection against clinical/icteric 
infections. Dynamic and decision models were used to estimate the expected 
number of cases, and the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
respectively. Several scenarios were explored by assuming: (1) varying duration 
of vaccine-induced immune memory, (2) and/or varying levels of vaccine-induced 
immune memory protection (IMP), (3) and/or varying levels of infectiousness in 
vaccinated individuals with IMP. The base case analysis assumed a time horizon 
of 25 y (2012 - 2036), with additional analyses over 50 and 75 y. The analyses 
were conducted in the Mexican public health system perspective. In the base case 
that assumed no vaccine-induced IMP, the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccination strategy 
was cost-effective compared with the 1-dose strategy over the 3 time horizons. 
However, it was not cost-effective if we assumed additional IMP durations of at 
least 10 y in the 25-y horizon. In the 50- and 75-y horizons, the 2-dose 
strategy was always cost-effective, except when 100% reduction in the 
probability of icteric Infections, 75% reduction in infectiousness, and mean 
durations of IMP of at least 50 y were assumed. This analysis indicates that 
routine vaccination of toddlers against hepatitis A virus would be 
cost-effective in Mexico using a single-dose vaccination strategy. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of a second dose depends on the assumptions of additional 
protection by IMP and the time horizon over which the analysis is performed.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported improvements in life expectancies of 
patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) over time, but it is not clear 
whether these improvements are explained by changes in baseline clinical 
characteristics, longer duration on ART or changes in clinical practices.
METHOD: Two parametric survival models were fitted to mortality data from South 
African ART cohorts that had linked patient records to the national vital 
registration system. The first model estimated mortality by age, sex, cohort, 
baseline CD4 cell count, time since ART initiation and period of ART initiation; 
the second model included only age, sex, cohort and period of follow-up. Life 
expectancies were calculated from the estimated mortality rates.
RESULTS: The first model estimated little change in mortality over time: women 
starting ART at age 35 years, at CD4 cell counts of 200 cells/μl or higher, had 
life expectancies of 32.7 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 31.6-33.6], 32.4 
years (95% CI: 31.3-33.4) and 33.0 years (95% CI: 32.0-34.1) in the 2001-2006, 
2007-2009 and 2010-2014 periods, respectively. However, the second model 
estimated a significant improvement in life expectancy; for all women on ART at 
age 35 years, corresponding life expectancies were 13.0 years (95% CI: 
12.1-14.2), 20.4 years (95% CI: 19.5-21.4) and 26.1 years (95% CI: 25.2-26.9), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although life expectancies in South African ART patients have 
improved over time, these improvements are not observed after controlling for 
changes in baseline CD4 cell count and ART duration. This suggests that changes 
in clinical practice and programme scale have had little impact on ART mortality 
in South Africa.

After domestication, during a process of widespread range extension, barley 
adapted to a broad spectrum of agricultural environments. To explore how the 
barley genome responded to the environmental challenges it encountered, we 
sequenced the exomes of a collection of 267 georeferenced landraces and wild 
accessions. A combination of genome-wide analyses showed that patterns of 
variation have been strongly shaped by geography and that variant-by-environment 
associations for individual genes are prominent in our data set. We observed 
significant correlations of days to heading (flowering) and height with seasonal 
temperature and dryness variables in common garden experiments, suggesting that 
these traits were major drivers of environmental adaptation in the sampled 
germplasm. A detailed analysis of known flowering-associated genes showed that 
many contain extensive sequence variation and that patterns of single- and 
multiple-gene haplotypes exhibit strong geographical structuring. This variation 
appears to have substantially contributed to range-wide ecogeographical 
adaptation, but many factors key to regional success remain unidentified.

Characterization of physical activity in undergraduate students in Israel.

Simchon Y(1), Turetsky O(1), Carmeli E(1).

Author information:
(1).

BACKGROUND: Technological development is the main cause for reduced physical 
activity in populations, increasing the risk of illness and decreasing average 
life expectancy. A correlation exists between increased physical exercise (PE) 
and health improvement. The academic curriculum attributes to lack of PE due to 
sedentary lifestyle and inability to find free time. The purpose of this study 
was to characterize PE among students in relation to World Health Organization 
(WHO) recommendations and examined the correlation between activity level and 
grade point average (GPA). We also included an evaluation of the student's 
willingness to exercise as part of an elective course program.
METHODS: We used a five experts validated questionnaire, distributed online. The 
sampling frame was undergraduate students of the Faculty of Social Welfare and 
Health from the University of Haifa (184 students). Statistical processing was 
done using SPSS software using the χ2 test and Pearson's correlation.
RESULTS: Of the participants 70.7% do not comply with WHO recommendations. 
Seventy-five percent showed willingness to perform PE if it was part of the 
curriculum. No significant correlations were found between PE or WHO 
recommendations and GPA.
CONCLUSION: This is a pioneer study among university students. Continued 
research is needed to characterize the PE in academic institutions.

Individuals who experience serious mental ill health such as schizophrenia are 
more likely to be overweight or obese than others in the general population. 
This high prevalence of obesity and other associated metabolic disturbances, 
such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, contribute to a reduced life 
expectancy of up to 25 years. Several reasons have been proposed for high levels 
of obesity including a shared biological vulnerability between serious mental 
ill health and abnormal metabolic processes, potentially compounded by unhealthy 
lifestyles. However, emerging evidence suggests that the most significant cause 
of weight gain is the metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication, usual 
treatment for people with serious mental ill health. In this paper we review the 
prevalence of obesity in people with serious mental ill health, explore the 
contribution that antipsychotic medication may make to weight gain and discuss 
the implications of this data for future research and the practice of mental

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of methylphenidate for depression 
treatment in patients with advanced cancer.
DESIGN: An 18-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 
methylphenidate for treatment of depression in selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor-treated patients with advanced cancer in hospice or receiving 
palliative care. The primary outcome was depression remission, defined as a ≥50% 
reduction in score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Among 47 enrolled participants, 34 were randomized. At study day 18, 
85% of the methylphenidate and 60% of the placebo group were in depression 
remission (P = .22). Mean time to depression remission was 10.3 days [standard 
error (SE) 1.8] in the methylphenidate and 8.1 (SE 1.3) in the placebo group 
(P = .48). The mean baseline score for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) was 10.4 in each group and decreased by 3.6 (SE 1.1) in the 
methylphenidate and 2.3 (SE 1.2) in the placebo group (P = .51) by day 18. Once 
in remission, 1 methylphenidate and 5 placebo participants relapsed to 
depression (P = .18). There was no difference in mortality between the groups 
during the trial. Trial results were limited by small sample size attributed to 
difficulties in recruiting terminally ill patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to demonstrate that methylphenidate treatment in 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-treated patients had a significant effect 
on depression remission in patients with advanced cancer. This study underscores 
the difficulties in conducting trials for symptom management in patients with 
shortened life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of road traffic injuries and deaths for all 
road users and among different road user groups in Africa.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Google Scholar, websites of 
African road safety agencies and organizations for registry- and 
population-based studies and reports on road traffic injury and death estimates 
in Africa, published between 1980 and 2015. Available data for all road users 
and by road user group were extracted and analysed. We conducted a 
random-effects meta-analysis and estimated pooled rates of road traffic injuries 
and deaths.
FINDINGS: We identified 39 studies from 15 African countries. The estimated 
pooled rate for road traffic injury was 65.2 per 100 000 population (95% 
confidence interval, CI: 60.8-69.5) and the death rate was 16.6 per 100 000 
population (95% CI: 15.2-18.0). Road traffic injury rates increased from 40.7 
per 100 000 population in the 1990s to 92.9 per 100 000 population between 2010 
and 2015, while death rates decreased from 19.9 per 100 000 population in the 
1990s to 9.3 per 100 000 population between 2010 and 2015. The highest road 
traffic death rate was among motorized four-wheeler occupants at 5.9 per 100 000 
population (95% CI: 4.4-7.4), closely followed by pedestrians at 3.4 per 100 000 
population (95% CI: 2.5-4.2).
CONCLUSION: The burden of road traffic injury and death is high in Africa. Since 
registry-based reports underestimate the burden, a systematic collation of road 
traffic injury and death data is needed to determine the true burden.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Estimer l'incidence des traumatismes et des décès dus à des 
accidents de la route pour toute la population des usagers et pour les 
différents groupes d'usagers de la route, en Afrique.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons fait des recherches dans MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, 
Google Scholar et sur des sites Internet d'organisations et d'agences de 
sécurité routière africaines, pour trouver des rapports et des études réalisées 
en population ou à partir de registres, concernant l'estimation des traumatismes 
et des décès dus à des accidents de la route en Afrique, publiés entre 1980 et 
2015. Les données obtenues pour l'ensemble des usagers de la route et pour 
chaque groupe d'usagers ont été extraites et analysées. Nous avons effectué une 
méta-analyse à effets aléatoires et avons estimé les taux combinés des 
traumatismes et des décès dus à des accidents de la route.
RÉSULTATS: Nous avons identifié 39 études, de 15 pays africains. Le taux combiné 
de traumatismes dus à des accidents de la route a été estimé à 65,2 pour 
100 000 habitants (intervalle de confiance -IC- de 95%: 60,8–69,5) et le taux de 
décès a été estimé à 16,6 pour 100 000 habitants (IC de 95%: 15,2-18,0). Le taux 
de traumatismes dus à des accidents de la route a augmenté de 40,7 pour 
100 000 habitants dans les années 1990 à 92,2 pour 100 000 habitants pour la 
période entre 2010 et 2015, tandis que le taux de décès est passé de 19,9 pour 
100 000 habitants dans les années 1990 à 9,3 pour 100 000 habitants entre 2010 
et 2015. Le taux le plus élevé de tués sur les routes correspond aux occupants 
de véhicules motorisés à quatre roues, avec 5,9 victimes de la route pour 
100 000 habitants (IC de 95 %: 4,4–7,4), suivis de près par les piétons, avec 
3,4 décès pour 100 000 habitants (IC de 95%: 2,5-4,2).
CONCLUSION: L'incidence des traumatismes et des décès dus à des accidents de la 
route est élevée en Afrique. Étant donné que les rapports fondés sur des 
registres sous-estiment les chiffres réels, il est nécessaire de procéder à un 
enregistrement systématique des données sur les traumatismes et les décès dus à 
des accidents de la route pour pouvoir déterminer leur véritable incidence.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Estimar la tasa de traumatismos y muertes por accidentes de 
tráfico para todos los usuarios de las carreteras y entre los distintos grupos 
de usuarios de las carreteras en África.
MÉTODOS: Se realizaron búsquedas en MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Google 
Scholar y sitios web de agencias y organizaciones de seguridad vial africanas 
para encontrar estudios e informes basados en la población y en los registros 
sobre estimaciones de traumatismos y muertes por accidentes de tráfico en África 
publicados entre 1980 y 2015. Se extrajeron y analizaron los datos disponibles 
para todos los usuarios de las carreteras y por grupo de usuarios de las 
carreteras. Se realizó un metaanálisis de efectos aleatorios y se estimaron 
tasas agrupadas de traumatismos y muertes por accidentes de tráfico.
RESULTADOS: Se identificaron 39 estudios de 15 países africanos. La tasa 
agrupada estimada de traumatismos por accidentes de tráfico fue de 65,2 por cada 
100 000 habitantes (intervalo de confianza, IC, del 95%: 60,8–69,5) y la tasa de 
muertes fue de 16,6 por cada 100 000 habitantes (IC del 95%: 15,2–18,0). Las 
tasas de traumatismos por accidentes de tráfico aumentaron de 40,7 por cada 
100 000 habitantes en la década de 1990 a 92,9 por cada 100 000 habitantes entre 
2010 y 2015, mientras que las tasas de muertes se redujeron de 19,9 por cada 
100 000 habitantes en la década de 1990 a 9,3 por cada 100 000 habitantes entre 
2010 y 2015. La mayor tasa de muertes por accidentes de tráfico se encontró 
entre los ocupantes de vehículos motorizados de cuatro ruedas, con un 5,9 por 
cada 100 000 habitantes (IC del 95%: 4,4–7,4), seguida muy de cerca por los 
peatones, con un 3,4 por cada 100 000 habitantes (IC del 95%: 2,5–4,2).
CONCLUSIÓN: En África, la tasa de traumatismos y muertes por accidentes de 
tráfico es alta. Puesto que los informes basados en registros infravaloran dicha 
tasa, es necesario un cotejo sistemático de datos de traumatismos y muertes por 
accidentes de tráfico para determinar la tasa real.

Publisher: الغرض: تقدير عبء الإصابات وحالات الوفاة الناجمة عن حوادث المرور فيما 
يتعلق بمستخدمي الطرق في مجملهم وضمن المجموعات المختلفة لمستخدمي الطرق في 
أفريقيا.
الطريقة: بحثنا في قواعد معطيات MEDLINE، وEMBASE، وGlobal Health، وGoogle 
Scholar، والمواقع الإلكترونية للهيئات المعنية بالحفاظ على السلامة على الطرق عن 
الدراسات القائمة على السجلات وقطاع السكان وكذلك التقارير التي تناولت تقديرات 
للإصابات وحالات الوفاة الناجمة عن حوادث المرور في أفريقيا والتي تم نشرها في 
الفترة بين عامي 1980 و2015. وتم استخلاص وتحليل البيانات المتاحة فيما يتعلق 
بمستخدمي الطرق في مجملهم والمصنفة حسب مجموعة مستخدمي الطرق. استخدمنا نموذج 
الآثار العشوائية للتحليل التلوي وقدّرنا المعدلات المجمعة للإصابات وحالات الوفاة 
الناجمة عن حوادث المرور.
النتائج: حددنا 39 دراسة مستمدة من 15 دولة أفريقية. وبلغ المعدل المجمع للإصابات 
الناجمة عن حوادث المرور حسب التقديرات 65.2 لكل شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 
10,000 نسمة (بنسبة أرجحية مقدارها 95%: 60.8 – 69.5) وبلغ معدل الوفيات 16.6 لكل 
شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 100,000 نسمة (بنسبة أرجحية مقدارها ‏95%: 
15.2–18.0). وارتفعت معدلات الإصابة الناجمة عن حوادث الطرق من 40.7 لكل شريحة 
سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 100,000 نسمة في التسعينيات من القرن العشرين لتصل إلى 
92.9 لكل شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 100,000 نسمة في الفترة بين 2010 و2015، 
بينما انخفضت معدلات الوفاة من 19.9 لكل شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 100,000 
نسمة في التسعينيات من القرن العشرين لتبلغ 9.3 لكل شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 
100,000 نسمة في الفترة بين عامي 2010 و2015. وكان أعلى معدل للوفيات الناجمة عن 
حوادث المرور لمستخدمي المركبات ذات الأربع عجلات المزودة بمحرك، حيث بلغ 5.9 لكل 
شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 100,000 نسمة (بنسبة أرجحية مقدارها 95‏%: 4.4 – 
7.4)، ويليهم بفارق صغير المشاة بمعدل يبلغ 3.4 لكل شريحة سكانية يبلغ عدد أفرادها 
100,000 نسمة (بنسبة أرجحية مقدارها 95‏%: 2.5–4.2).
الاستنتاج: إن عبء الإصابة وحالات الوفاة الناجمة عن حوادث الطرق مرتفع في أفريقيا. 
ونظرًا للدور الذي تلعبه التقارير القائمة على السجلات في خفض تقديرات العبء عن 
معدلاتها الحقيقية، فإن الأمر يقتضي تجميع البيانات المتعلقة بالإصابة وحالات 
الوفاة الناجمة عن حوادث المرور ومقارنتها بطريقة منهجية لتحديد العبء الحقيقي.

Publisher: 目的: 旨在为非洲所有的道路用户以及不同道路用户人群评估道路交通伤害和死亡的负担。.
方法: 我们检索了联机医学文献分析和检索系统 (MEDLINE)、荷兰医学文摘数据库 (EMBASE)、全球健康 (Global 
Health)、谷歌学术 (Google 
Scholar) 和非洲道路安全机构和组织的网站，收集了 1980 年至 2015 年期间发布的关于非洲道路交通伤害和死亡估计的基于登记信息和人群的研究和报告。同时，摘取了针对所有道路用户以及道路用户人群提供的现有数据，并对其进行了分析。我们开展了随机效应元分析，并且评估了道路交通伤害和死亡的总发生率。.
结果: 我们从 15 个非洲国家确定了 39 项研究。 
道路交通伤害的总发生率预计为每 10 万人中 65.2 例（95% 置信区间，CI： 60.8–69.5）死亡率为每 10 万人中 16.6 例（95% CI：15.2–18.0）。与 20 世纪 90 年代相比，在 2010 年至 2015 年期间，道路交通伤害率从每 10 万人中 40.7 例上升到每 10 万人中 92.9 例，同期，死亡率从每 10 万人中 19.9 例减少到每 10 万人中 9.3 例。道路交通死亡发生率最高的人群是四轮机动车车主，为每 10 万人中 5.9 例 (95% CI: 4.4–7.4)，紧随其后的是行人，为每 10 万人中 3.4 例 
(95% CI: 2.5–4.2)。.
结论: 非洲道路交通事故和伤亡负担很重。由于基于登记信息的报告会低估负担程度，因此需要对道路交通伤害和死亡数据进行系统整理，以确定真实的负担程度。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Оценить бремя травматизма и смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий для всех участников дорожного движения и для 
различных групп участников дорожного движения в Африке.
МЕТОДЫ: Был выполнен поиск в базах данных MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, 
системе Google Scholar, на веб-сайтах африканских учреждений по обеспечению 
безопасности дорожного движения и организаций на предмет реестровых и 
популяционных исследований травматизма и смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий в Африке и отчетов по ним, опубликованных в 
период между 1980 и 2015 годами. Доступные данные по всем участникам дорожного 
движения и по их отдельным группам были извлечены и проанализированы. С помощью 
метаанализа с использованием модели случайных эффектов были рассчитаны 
объединенные показатели травматизма и смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Было выявлено 39 исследований из 15 стран Африки. Объединенный 
расчетный показатель дорожно-транспортного травматизма составил 65,2 случая на 
100 000 жителей (95%-й доверительный интервал, ДИ: 60,8–69,5), а показатель 
смертности составил 16,6 случая на 100 000 жителей (95%-й ДИ: 15,2–18,0). 
Показатели травматизма в результате дорожно-транспортных происшествий 
увеличились с 40,7 случая на 100 000 жителей в 1990-х годах до 92,9 случая на 
100 000 жителей в период с 2010 по 2015 год, а показатели смертности снизились с 
19,9 случая на 100 000 жителей в 1990-х годах до 9,3 случая на 100 000 жителей в 
период с 2010 по 2015 год. Наибольший показатель смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий наблюдался среди пассажиров моторных 
четырехколесных транспортных средств и составлял 5,9 случая на 
100 000 жителей (95%-й ДИ: 4,4–7,4); ненамного меньший показатель наблюдался 
среди пешеходов и составлял 3,4 случая на 100 000 жителей (95%-й ДИ: 2,5–4,2).
ВЫВОД: В Африке существует высокое бремя травматизма и смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий. Поскольку показатели бремени, полученные в 
результате реестровых исследований, занижены, для определения истинного бремени 
требуется систематизация данных по травматизму и смертности в результате 
дорожно-транспортных происшествий.

BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the 
cell surface glycoprotein CD52, is licensed in Europe since October 2013 as 
treatment for adult patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS). In three randomized, rater-blinded active comparator clinical trials 
studies, alemtuzumab administered in two annual courses, had superior efficacy 
as compared to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and durable efficacy over 5 
years in an extension study with a manageable safety profile in RRMS patients. 
Data on the utilization and the outcomes of alemtuzumab under clinical practice 
conditions are limited.
METHODS: Here we describe the rationale, design and methods of the TREAT-MS 
study (non-interventional long-Term study foR obsErvAtion of Treatment with 
alemtuzumab in active relapsing-remitting MS).
DISCUSSION: TREAT-MS is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, 
long-term study to collect data on safety, effectiveness, quality of life, 
cognition and other aspects from 3200 RRMS patients treated with alemtuzumab 
under the conditions of real-world clinical practice in Germany.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: As non-interventional trial in Germany.

[Need to reform education in graduate schools of public health in Japan: Toward 
outcome-based education to cultivate competencies].

[Article in Japanese]

Japan, known for its good healthcare access via universal health insurance, 
leads the world in terms of life expectancy, and possesses a public health 
system that has improved health standards markedly in the 20th century. However, 
we currently face major challenges to maintain and promote people's health. 
Although these complicated problems pose numerous threats to public welfare, 
education of public health for health professionals still retains 20th-century 
standards. This also means that graduate education of public health in Japan is 
traditionally based on obtaining licensure as a medical professional, conducting 
research and writing papers, and on-the-job training. Since graduate school 
education is expected to produce competent public health leaders, Japan requires 
a reform toward a new education design that caters to the current societal 
needs. The current global trend in the education of health professionals leans 
toward outcome-based education to meet core competencies. Here, "competency" 
refers to a set of features or particular behavioral patterns possessed by 
highly qualified persons. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
established a general health professional competency standard that includes both 
management and leadership competencies. Moreover, the Lancet Commission 
concluded that there was a need for transformative education based on a "health 
system approach." In brief, this means that our education should correspond to 
the needs of the health system to allow for the resolution of problems by 
educated professionals with satisfactory levels of competencies. In addition, as 
"change agents," these competent professionals are expected to promote societal 
change toward the realization of better public health. In Japan, the Central 
Education Council has produced several reports on professional graduate school 
reform since 2000. These reports indicate that graduate school curricula require 
reform to allow the health professionals to work locally and globally, as well 
as to solve problems through the application of systematic knowledge that 
matches practice with theory. Therefore, with reference to the current Japanese 
health situation, global trends in education, and the Japanese educational 
policies, transformational changes are needed toward a new era of Japanese 
public health education specifically through outcome-based education to improve 
the health professionals competencies. We hope that education in the new schools 
of public health will contribute to solve authentic public health problems and 
create a healthy future with competent professionals.

BACKGROUND: The use of the EQ-5D to asses the economic benefits of health 
technologies has led to questions about the cross-population transferability of 
preference weights to calculate health utility scores. The aim of this study is 
to investigate whether the use of UK and Canadian preference weights will lead 
to the calculation of different health utility scores in a sample of persons 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their primary informal caregivers.
METHODS: We recruited 216 patient-caregiver dyads from nine geriatric and memory 
clinics across Canada. Participants used the EQ-5D-3L to rate their 
health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). EQ-5D-3L responses were transformed into 
health utility scores using UK and Canadian preference weights. The levels of 
agreement between the two sets of scores were assessed using intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICCs). Bland-Altman plots depicted individual-level 
differences between the two sets of scores. Differences in health utility scores 
were tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. A generalized linear model 
with a gamma distribution was used to examine whether participants' 
socio-demographic characteristics were associated with their health utility 
scores.
RESULTS: The distributions of health utility scores derived from both the UK and 
Canadian preference weights were skewed to the left. The intraclass correlation 
coefficient was 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.92, 0.95) for persons with AD and 0.92 (95 % 
CI: 0.88, 0.94) for the caregivers. The Canadian weights yielded slightly higher 
median health utility scores than the UK weights for caregivers (median 
difference: 0.009; 95 % confidence interval: 0.007, 0.013). This finding 
persisted after stratifying by disease severity. Few socio-demographic 
characteristics were associated with the two sets of health utility scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Health utility scores exhibited small and clinically unimportant 
differences when calculated with UK versus Canadian preference weights in 
persons with AD and their caregivers. The original UK and Canadian population 
samples used to obtain the preference weights valued health states similarly.

BACKGROUND: If effective, less intensive treatments for people with personality 
disorder have the potential to serve more people.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
psychoeducation with problem-solving (PEPS) therapy plus usual treatment against 
usual treatment alone in improving social problem-solving with adults with 
personality disorder.
DESIGN: Multisite two-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled 
superiority trial.
SETTING: Community mental health services in three NHS trusts in England and 
Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults with any personality disorder recruited 
from community mental health services.
INTERVENTIONS: Up to four individual sessions of psychoeducation, a 
collaborative dialogue about personality disorder, followed by 12 group sessions 
of problem-solving therapy to help participants learn a process for solving 
interpersonal problems.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was measured by the Social 
Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ). Secondary outcomes were service use (general 
practitioner records), mood (measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale) and client-specified three main problems rated by severity. We studied 
the mechanism of change using the Social Problem-Solving Inventory. Costs were 
identified using the Client Service Receipt Inventory and quality of life was 
identified by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire. Research 
assistants blinded to treatment allocation collected follow-up information.
RESULTS: There were 739 people referred for the trial and 444 were eligible. 
More adverse events in the PEPS arm led to a halt to recruitment after 306 
people were randomised (90% of planned sample size); 154 participants received 
PEPS and 152 received usual treatment. The mean age was 38 years and 67% were 
women. Follow-up at 72 weeks after randomisation was completed for 62% of 
participants in the usual-treatment arm and 73% in the PEPS arm. 
Intention-to-treat analyses compared individuals as randomised, regardless of 
treatment received or availability of 72-week follow-up SFQ data. Median 
attendance at psychoeducation sessions was approximately 90% and for 
problem-solving sessions was approximately 50%. PEPS therapy plus usual 
treatment was no more effective than usual treatment alone for the primary 
outcome [adjusted difference in means for SFQ -0.73 points, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) -1.83 to 0.38 points; p = 0.19], any of the secondary outcomes or 
social problem-solving. Over the follow-up, PEPS costs were, on average, £182 
less than for usual treatment. It also resulted in 0.0148 more quality-adjusted 
life-years. Neither difference was statistically significant. At the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence thresholds, the intervention had a 64% 
likelihood of being the more cost-effective option. More adverse events, mainly 
incidents of self-harm, occurred in the PEPS arm, but the difference was not 
significant (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.64).
LIMITATIONS: There was possible bias in adverse event recording because of 
dependence on self-disclosure or reporting by the clinical team. Non-completion 
of problem-solving sessions and non-standardisation of usual treatment were 
limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the use of PEPS therapy alongside 
standard care for improving social functioning of adults with personality 
disorder living in the community.
FUTURE WORK: We aim to investigate adverse events by accessing centrally held 
NHS data on deaths and hospitalisation for all PEPS trial participants.
