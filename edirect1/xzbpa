CHC patients. Trials have shown that the new treatments increased the rate to 
80% to 95%, though with a substantial increase in cost. In particular, current 
market pricing of a 12-week course of sofosbuvir is approximately US$84,000. We 
determine the cost-effectiveness of new treatments in comparison with the 
standard care of treatments.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model of CHC disease progression is used to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies based on 
genotype. The model calculates the expected lifetime medical costs and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) of hypothetical cohorts of identical patients 
receiving certain treatments. For genotype 1, we compare: (1) 
peginterferon + ribavirin + telaprevir for 12 weeks, followed by 12 or 24 weeks 
treatment of peginterferon + ribavirin dependent on HCV RNA level at week 12; 
(2) Harvoni treatment, 12 weeks; (3) Olysio + Sovaldi, 12 weeks for patients 
without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients with cirrhosis; (4) Viekira 
Pak + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis, 24 weeks for patients 
with cirrhosis; (5) sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin, 12 weeks for 
patients with or without cirrhosis. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment strategies 
include: (1) peginterferon + ribavirin, 24 weeks for treatment-naïve patients; 
(2) sofosbuvir + ribavirin, 12 weeks for patients with genotype 2, 24 weeks for 
genotype 3; (3) peginterferon + ribavirin as initial treatment, 24 weeks for 
patients with genotype 2/3, follow-up treatment with sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 
12/16 weeks are performed on non-responders and relapsers.
RESULTS: Viekira Pak is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients without 
cirrhosis, whereas Harvoni is cost-effective for genotype 1 patients with 
cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-based treatments for genotype 1 in general are not 
cost-effective due to its substantial high costs. Two-phase treatments with 
12-week and 16-week follow-ups are cost-effective for genotype 3 patients and 
for genotype 2 patients with cirrhosis. The results were shown to be robust over 
a broad range of parameter values through sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: For genotype 1, sofosbuvir-based treatments are not cost-effective 
compared to Viekira Pak and Harvoni, although a 30% reduction in sofosbuvir 
price would change this result. Sofosbuvir + ribavirin are cost-effective as 
second-phase treatments following peginterferon + ribavirin initial treatment 
for genotypes 2 and 3. However, there is limited data on sofosbuvir-involved 
treatment, and the results obtained in this study must be interpreted within the 
model assumptions.

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a growing worldwide epidemic. It was estimated that 
more than 366 million people would be affected. DM has spread its presence over 
the world due to lifestyle changes, increasing obesity and ethnicities, among 
others. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important DM complications. 
A changing concept has been introduced from the classical DN to diabetic chronic 
kidney disease (DCKD), taking into account that histological kidney lesions may 
vary from the nodular or diffuse glomerulosclerosis to tubulointerstitial and/or 
vascular lesions. Recent data showed how primary and secondary prevention were 
the key to reduce cardiovascular episodes and improve life expectancy in 
diabetic patients. A stabilization in the rate of end stage kidney disease has 
been observed in some countries, probably due to the increased awareness by 
primary care physicians about the prognostic importance of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD), better control of blood pressure and glycaemia and the 
implementation of protocols and clinical practice recommendations about the 
detection, prevention and treatment of CKD in a coordinated and 
multidisciplinary management of the DM patient. Early detection of DM and DCKD 
is crucial to reduce morbidity, mortality and the social and economic impact of 
DM burden in this population.

BACKGROUND: With recent advances in oncologic treatments, there has been an 
increase in patient survival rates and concurrently an increase in the number of 
incidence of symptomatic spinal metastases. Because elderly patients are a 
substantial part of the oncology population, their types of treatment as well as 
the possible impact their treatment will have on healthcare resources need to be 
further examined.
PURPOSE: We studied whether age has a significant influence on quality of life 
and survival in surgical interventions for spinal metastases.
STUDY DESIGN: We used data from a multicenter prospective study by the Global 
Spine Tumor Study Group (GSTSG). This GSTSG study involved 1,266 patients who 
were admitted for surgical treatments of symptomatic spinal metastases at 22 
spinal centers from different countries and followed up for 2 years after 
surgery.
PATIENT SAMPLE: There were 1,266 patients recruited between March 2001 and 
October 2014.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics were collected along with outcome 
measures, including European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), neurologic 
functions, complications, and survival rates.
METHODS: We realized a multicenter prospective study of 1,266 patients admitted 
for surgical treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases. They were divided and 
studied into three different age groups: <70, 70-80, and >80 years.
RESULTS: Despite a lack of statistical difference in American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Frankel neurologic score, or Karnofsky functional 
score at presentation, patients >80 years were more likely to undergo emergency 
surgery and palliative procedures compared with younger patients. Postoperative 
complications were more common in the oldest age group (33.3% in the >80, 23.9% 
in the 70-80, and 17.9% for patients <70 years, p=.004). EQ-5D improved in all 
groups, but survival expectancy was significantly longer in patients <70 years 
old (p=.02). Furthermore, neurologic recovery after surgery was lower in 
patients >80 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should not be biased against operating elderly patients. 
Although survival rates and neurologic improvements in the elderly patients are 
lower than for younger patients, operating the elderly is compounded by the fact 
that they undergo more emergency and palliative procedures, despite good ASA 
scores and functional status. Age in itself should not be a determinant of 
whether to operate or not, and operations should not be avoided in the elderly 
when indicated.

PURPOSE: In the ESTIMABL phase III trial, the thyroid ablation rate was 
equivalent for the two thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation methods 
(thyroid hormone withdrawal [THW] and recombinant human TSH [rhTSH]) and the two 
iodine-131 ((131)I) activities (1.1 or 3.7 GBq). The objectives of this article 
were to present health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) results and a 
cost-effectiveness evaluation performed alongside this trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: HRQoL and utility were longitudinally assessed, from 
random assignment to the follow-up visit at 8 ± 2 months for the 752 patients 
with thyroid cancer, using the Short Form-36 and the EuroQoL-5D questionnaires, 
respectively. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal 
perspective in the French context. Resource use (hospitalization for (131)I 
administration, rhTSH, sick leaves, and transportation) was collected 
prospectively. We used the net monetary benefit approach and computed 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for both TSH stimulation methods and 
(131)I activities. Sensitivity analyses of the costs of rhTSH were performed.
RESULTS: At (131)I administration, THW caused a clinically significant 
deterioration of HRQoL, whereas HRQoL remained stable with rhTSH. This 
deterioration was transient with no difference 3 months later. rhTSH was more 
effective than THW in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; +0.013 
QALY/patient) but more expensive (+€474/patient). The probability that rhTSH 
would be cost effective at a €50,000/QALY threshold was 47% in France. The use 
of 1.1 GBq of (131)I instead of 3.7 GBq reduced per-patient costs by €955 
(US$1,018) but with slightly decreased efficacy (-0.007 QALY/patient).
CONCLUSION: rhTSH avoids the transient THW-induced deterioration of HRQoL but is 
unlikely to be cost effective at its current price.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and the 
associated risk factors of pinhole type of durotomy and cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) leakage following a simple laminectomy for spinal stenosis.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The incidence of spinal stenosis is expected to rise 
with increasing life expectancy. Moreover, lumbar spinal stenosis is the most 
common indication for spinal injury in the geriatric population. It is therefore 
important to identify and prevent the risks associated with laminectomy, the 
most widely used surgical procedure for spinal stenosis. The serious 
complication of incidental dural tear or durotomy and subsequent CSF leakage has 
not been studied in the region of Southeast Asia.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, we included 138 adult patients (age>18 
years), who underwent a simple laminectomy for lumbar stenosis between 2011 and 
2012. CSF leakage was the main outcome variable. Patients' wounds were examined 
for CSF leakage up to 1 week postoperatively.
RESULTS: The incidence of pinhole type durotomy and subsequent CSF leakage in 
our region was 8.7%. Univariate analysis showed that hypertension, diabetes and 
smoking were significantly associated with durotomy and increased CSF leakage by 
16.72, 44.25, and 33.71 times, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that 
only smoking and diabetes significantly increased the chances of leakage.
CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control and cessation of smoking prior to a simple 
laminectomy procedure reduced the incidence of a dural tear. Larger clinical 
studies on this lethal complication are required.

BACKGROUND: Uterine polyps cause abnormal bleeding in women and conventional 
practice is to remove them in hospital under general anaesthetic. Advances in 
technology make it possible to perform polypectomy in an outpatient setting, yet 
evidence of effectiveness is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that in women with abnormal uterine bleeding 
(AUB) associated with benign uterine polyp(s), outpatient polyp treatment 
achieved as good, or no more than 25% worse, alleviation of bleeding symptoms at 
6 months compared with standard inpatient treatment. The hypothesis that 
response to uterine polyp treatment differed according to the pattern of AUB, 
menopausal status and longer-term follow-up was tested. The cost-effectiveness 
and acceptability of outpatient polypectomy was examined.
DESIGN: A multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, 
incorporating a cost-effectiveness analysis and supplemented by a parallel 
patient preference study. Patient acceptability was evaluated by interview in a 
qualitative study.
SETTING: Outpatient hysteroscopy clinics and inpatient gynaecology departments 
within UK NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Women with AUB - defined as heavy menstrual bleeding (formerly 
known as menorrhagia) (HMB), intermenstrual bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding 
- and hysteroscopically diagnosed uterine polyps.
INTERVENTIONS: We randomly assigned 507 women, using a minimisation algorithm, 
to outpatient polypectomy compared with conventional inpatient polypectomy as a 
day case in hospital under general anaesthesia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was successful treatment at 6 months, 
determined by the woman's assessment of her bleeding. Secondary outcomes 
included quality of life, procedure feasibility, acceptability and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: At 6 months, 73% (166/228) of women who underwent outpatient 
polypectomy were successfully treated compared with 80% (168/211) following 
inpatient polypectomy [relative risk (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.82 to 1.02]. The lower end of the CIs showed that outpatient polypectomy was 
at most 18% worse, in relative terms, than inpatient treatment, within the 25% 
margin of non-inferiority set at the outset of the study. By 1 and 2 years the 
corresponding proportions were similar producing RRs close to unity. There was 
no evidence that the treatment effect differed according to any of the 
predefined subgroups when treatments by variable interaction parameters were 
examined. Failure to completely remove polyps was higher (19% vs. 7%; RR 2.5, 
95% CI 1.5 to 4.1) with outpatient polypectomy. Procedure acceptability was 
reduced with outpatient compared with inpatient polyp treatment (83% vs. 92%; RR 
0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). There were no significant differences in quality of 
life. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios at 6 and 12 months for inpatient 
treatment were £1,099,167 and £668,800 per additional QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When treating women with AUB associated with uterine polyps, 
outpatient polypectomy was non-inferior to inpatient polypectomy at 6 and 12 
months, and relatively cost-effective. However, patients need to be aware that 
failure to remove a polyp is more likely with outpatient polypectomy and 
procedure acceptability lower.

Biology, Kolkata, India bDepartment of Biochemistry, Boston University School of 
Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiac 
dysfunction, hypertension, and hepatic steatosis, share one critical causative 
factor: abnormal lipid partitioning, that redistribution of triglycerides from 
adipocytes to nonadipose peripheral tissues. Lipid overload of these tissues 
causes a number of pathological effects collectively known as lipotoxicity. If 
we find the way to correct lipid partitioning, we will restrain metabolic 
diseases, improve life quality and life expectancy and radically reduce 
healthcare costs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lipid partitioning in the body is maintained by tightly 
regulated and balanced rates of de novo lipogenesis, lipolysis, adipogenesis, 
and mitochondrial oxidation primarily in fat and liver. Recent studies 
highlighted in this review have established mTOR as a central regulator of lipid 
storage and metabolism.
SUMMARY: Increased activity of mTOR in obesity may compensate for the negative 
consequences of overnutrition, whereas dysregulation of mTOR may lead to 
abnormal lipid partitioning and metabolic disease.

Risky Treatments: A Jewish Medical Ethics Perspective.

Steinberg A(1).

Author information:
(1)Director, Medical Ethics Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, 
Israel.

The Jewish principle concerning a decision with regard to a dangerous treatment 
is as following: A patient who is estimated to die within 12 months because of a 
fatal illness is permitted to undergo a treatment that on the one hand may 
extend his life beyond 12 months, but on the other hand may hasten his death. 
There are, however, several limitations to this ruling related to the chances of 
success with the proposed treatment, the nature of the treatment, whether it is 
intended to be curative or merely to postpone the danger and death, whether the 
treatment is absolutely necessary, and others. One is not obligated to undergo a 
dangerous treatment, but one is permitted to do so. The permissibility to 
forfeit a short life expectancy in order to achieve more prolonged life applies 
only with the patient's consent. That consent is valid and is not considered a 
form of attempted suicide. Neither is a refusal to submit to treatment 
considered an act of suicide; the patient has the right to refuse a dangerous 
procedure. In all situations where a permissive ruling is granted for a patient 
to endanger his short life expectancy, the ruling should be arrived at after 
careful reflection and with the approval of the rabbinic authorities acting on 
the recommendation of the most expert physicians.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) present an effective anticoagulant 
treatment in deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, the use of VKAs is limited 
because of the risk of bleeding and the necessity of frequent and long-term 
laboratory monitoring. Therefore, new oral anticoagulant drugs (NOACs) such as 
dabigatran, with lower rates of (major) intracranial bleeding compared to VKAs 
and not requiring monitoring, may be considered.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate resource utilization and costs of patients treated with 
the VKAs acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon, for the indication DVT. Furthermore, a 
formal cost-effectiveness analysis of dabigatran compared to VKAs for DVT 
treatment was performed, using these estimates.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study design in the thrombotic service of 
a teaching hospital (Deventer, The Netherlands) was applied to estimate 
real-world resource utilization and costs of VKA monitoring. A pooled analysis 
of data from RE-COVER and RE-COVER II on DVT was used to reflect the 
probabilities for events in the cost-effectiveness model. Dutch costs, utilities 
and specific data on coagulation monitoring levels were incorporated in the 
model. Next to the base case analysis, univariate probabilistic sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Real-world resource utilization in the thrombotic service of patients 
treated with VKA for the indication of DVT consisted of 12.3 measurements of the 
international normalized ratio (INR), with corresponding INR monitoring costs of 
€138 for a standardized treatment period of 180 days. In the base case, 
dabigatran treatment compared to VKAs in a cohort of 1,000 DVT patients resulted 
in savings of €18,900 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) -95,832, 151,162) and 41 
(95% UI -18, 97) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained calculated from 
societal perspective. The probability that dabigatran is cost-effective at a 
conservative willingness-to pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY was 99%. 
Sensitivity and scenario analyses also indicated cost savings or 
cost-effectiveness below this same threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Total INR monitoring costs per patient were estimated at minimally 
€138. Inserting these real-world data into a cost-effectiveness analysis for 
patients diagnosed with DVT, dabigatran appeared to be a cost-saving alternative 
to VKAs in the Netherlands in the base case. Cost savings or favorable 
cost-effectiveness were robust in sensitivity and scenario analyses. Our results 
warrant confirmation in other settings and locations.

An Emerging Era in the Management of Parkinson's Disease: Wearable Technologies 
and the Internet of Things.

Pasluosta CF, Gassner H, Winkler J, Klucken J, Eskofier BM.

Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare 
system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world 
population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked 
prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform 
such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be 
obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in 
the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile 
devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge 
amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home 
during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent 
algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust 
medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate 
strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies 
in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient 
experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined 
objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both 
medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable 
technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis 
on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of 
diagnostics and treatment.

The aim of the present study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) 
of ventricular assist devices (VAD) implantation surgery in the Japanese medical 
reimbursement system. The study group consisted of thirty-seven patients who had 
undergone VAD implantation surgery for dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 25; 67.6 %) 
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 4; 10.8 %), and others (n = 8; 21.6 %). 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility score and 
years of life. Medical reimbursement bills were chosen as cost indices. The 
observation period was the 12-month period after surgery. Then, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated according to the VAD type. In addition, 
the prognosis after 36 months was estimated on the basis of the results obtained 
using the Markov chain model. The mean preoperative INTERMACS profile score was 
2.35 ± 0.77. Our results showed that the utility score, which indicates the 
effectiveness of VAD implantation surgery, improved by 0.279 ± 0.188 (ΔQALY, p < 
0.05). The cost of VAD implantation surgery was 313,282 ± 25,275 (ΔUS$/year) on 
the basis of medical reimbursement bills associated with therapeutic 
interventions. The calculated result of CEA was 364,501 ± 190,599 (ΔUS$/QALY). 
The improvement in the utility score was greater for implantable versus 
extracorporeal VADs (0.233 ± 0.534 vs. 0.371 ± 0.238) and ICER was 303,104 
(ΔUS$/ΔQALY). Furthermore, when we estimated CEA for 36 months, the expected 
baseline value was 102,712 (US$/QALY). Therefore, VAD implantation surgery was 
cost effective considering the disease specificities.

Can I Author Myself? The Limits of Transformation.

Narrative medicine is predicated on the importance of narrative to human life. 
Although that in itself is not controversial, an extension of this principle 
that has sprung up in narrative psychiatry--namely, that by coming to imagine a 
different life story one can become a different person--ought to be. One reason 
one cannot remake one's life in the image of a story is that life is not to be 
mistaken for a story in the first place. The seminal study of psychotherapy, 
Persuasion and Healing, although recommending that the demoralized absorb more 
uplifting stories about themselves, appears to recognize some limit to the 
possibility of modeling life on story. The same study likens therapeutic stories 
to placebos, but as it happens, placebos themselves have their limits, 
alleviating symptoms but not curing or "healing." In order for someone to become 
a different person through the agency of the placebo effect, it would have to be 
more robust than it is. The argument that life follows narrative is an ironic 
one for a discipline devoted to narrative to make, given the salience in the 
tradition of the novel, from Don Quixote forward, of works that explore the 
fallacies of that presumption. In keeping with its attention to narrative, this 
article challenges the use of a short story by Chitra Divakaruni as an 
illustration of the principles of narrative psychiatry.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of interventions designed to 
prevent falls and fall-related injuries among older people living in residential 
aged care facilities (RACFs) from an Australian health care perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed that stratified 
individuals according to their risk of falling and accounted for the risk of 
injury following a fall. The effectiveness of the interventions was derived from 
two Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials for falls/fall-related 
injury prevention in RACFs. Interventions were considered effective if they 
reduced the risk of falling or reduced the risk of injury following a fall. The 
interventions that were modelled included vitamin D supplementation, annual 
medication review, multifactorial intervention (a combination of risk 
assessment, medication review, vision assessment and exercise) and hip 
protectors. The cost effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost 
relative to the incremental benefit, in which the benefit was estimated using 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Uncertainty was explored using univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation and medication review both dominated 'no 
intervention', as these interventions were both more effective and cost saving 
(because of healthcare costs avoided). Hip protectors are dominated (less 
effective and more costly) by vitamin D and medication review. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for medication review relative to vitamin D 
supplementation is AU$2442 per QALY gained, and the ICER for multifactorial 
intervention relative to medication review is AU$1,112,500 per QALY gained. The 
model is most sensitive to the fear of falling and the cost of the 
interventions.
CONCLUSION: The model suggests that vitamin D supplementation and medication 
review are cost-effective interventions that reduce falls, provide health 
benefits and reduce health care costs in older adults living in RACFs.

and Cocaine.

Cocaine is habit-forming because of its ability to enhance dopaminergic 
neurotransmission in the forebrain. In addition to neuronal inputs, forebrain 
dopamine circuits are modulated by hormonal influences; one of these is leptin, 
an adipose-derived hormone that attenuates the rewarding effects of food- and 
hunger-associated brain stimulation reward. Here we report reciprocal inhibition 
between the reward-related effects of leptin and the reward-related effects of 
cocaine in rats. First, we report that cocaine and the expectancy of cocaine 
each depresses plasma leptin levels. Second, we report that exogenous leptin, 
given systemically or directly into the ventral tegmental area, attenuates the 
ability of cocaine to elevate dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, the 
ability of cocaine to establish a conditioned place preference, and the ability 
of cocaine-predictive stimuli to prolong responding in extinction of 
cocaine-seeking. Thus, whereas leptin represents an endogenous antagonist of the 
habit-forming and habit-sustaining effects of cocaine, this antagonism is 
attenuated by cocaine and comes to be attenuated by the expectancy of cocaine.

BACKGROUND: Low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma is commonly treated surgically. 
However, uncertainties exist in regard to the optimal extent of surgery. We 
approached this question using a decision-analysis model.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare outcome between patients with small 
(1-2 cm) low-risk PTC treated by hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy. 
Probabilities and utilities were derived from the literature. The model was 
evaluated with Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity analysis was used to 
determine which variables most affected the model.
RESULTS: Hemithyroidectomy was associated with a minor increase in mortality 
risk. After incorporation of mortality risk, complications, and quality-of-life 
measures, hemithyroidectomy was found to be superior to total thyroidectomy, 
with an increasing benefit over time. Quality-of-life measures, especially 
disutility of disease recurrence and undergoing surgery, had the greatest effect 
on the incremental benefit of hemithyroidectomy.
CONCLUSION: Based on our decision-analysis model, hemithyroidectomy is the 
preferred option in low-risk PTC.

In this study, several expression strategies were investigated in order to 
develop a generic, highly productive and efficient protocol to produce 
nanobodies modified with a clickable alkyne function at their C-terminus via the 
intein-mediated protein ligation (IPL) technique. Hereto, the nanobody targeting 
the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (NbVCAM1) was used as a workhorse. The 
highlights of the protocol can be ascribed to a cytoplasmic expression of the 
nanobody-intein-chitin-binding domain fusion protein in the Escherichia coli 
SHuffle(®) T7 cells with a C-terminal extension, i.e. LEY, EFLEY or His6 spacer 
peptide, in the commonly used Luria-Bertani medium. The combination of these 
factors led to a high yield (up to 22 mg/l of culture) and nearly complete 
alkynation efficiency of the C-terminally modified nanobody via IPL. This yield 
can even be improved to ∼45 mg/l in the EnPresso(®) growth system but this 
method is more expensive and time-consuming. The resulting alkynated nanobodies 
retained excellent binding capacity towards the recombinant human VCAM1. The 
presented protocol benefits from time- and cost-effectiveness, which allows a 
feasible production up-scaling of generic alkynated nanobodies. The production 
of high quantities of site-specifically modified nanobodies paves the way to new 
biosurface applications that demand for a homogeneously oriented nanobody 
coupling. Prospectively, the alkynated nanobodies can be covalently coupled to a 
multitude of azide-containing counterparts, e.g. contrast labeling agents, 
particles or surfaces for numerous innovative applications.

HYPOTHESIS: Cochlear implantation and deaf education are cost effective in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.
BACKGROUND: Cost effectiveness of pediatric cochlear implantation has been well 
established in developed countries but is unknown in low resource settings, 
where access to the technology has traditionally been limited. With incidence of 
severe-to-profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss 5 to 6 times higher in 
low/middle-income countries than the United States and Europe, developing 
cost-effective management strategies in these settings is critical.
METHODS: Costs were obtained from experts in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, 
Rwanda, Uganda, and Malawi using known costs and published data, with estimation 
when necessary. A disability adjusted life years (DALY) model was applied using 
3% discounting and 10-year length of analysis. Sensitivity analysis was 
performed to evaluate the effect of device cost, professional salaries, annual 
number of implants, and probability of device failure. Cost effectiveness was 
determined using the WHO standard of cost-effectiveness ratio/gross domestic 
product per capita (CER/GDP) less than 3.
RESULTS: Cochlear implantation was cost effective in South Africa and Nigeria, 
with CER/GDP of 1.03 and 2.05, respectively. Deaf education was cost effective 
in all countries investigated, with CER/GDP ranging from 0.55 to 1.56. The most 
influential factor in the sensitivity analysis was device cost, with the 
cost-effective threshold reached in all countries using discounted device costs 
that varied directly with GDP.
CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation and deaf education are equally cost effective 
in lower-middle and upper-middle income economies of Nigeria and South Africa. 
Device cost may have greater impact in the emerging economies of Kenya, Uganda, 
Rwanda, and Malawi.

Nosiheptide is a parent compound of thiopeptide family that exhibit potent 
activities against various bacterial pathogens. Its C-terminal amide formation 
is catalyzed by NosA, which is an unusual strategy for maturating certain 
thiopeptides by processing their precursor peptides featuring a serine 
extension. We here report the crystal structure of truncated NosA1-111 variant, 
revealing three key elements, including basic lysine 49 (K49), acidic glutamic 
acid 101 (E101) and flexible C-terminal loop NosA112-151, are crucial to the 
catalytic terminal amide formation in nosiheptide biosynthesis. The side-chain 
of residue K49 and the C-terminal loop fasten the substrate through hydrogen 
bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The side-chain of residue E101 enhances 
nucleophilic attack of H2O to the methyl imine intermediate, leading to Cα-N 
bond cleavage and nosiheptide maturation. The sequence alignment of NosA and its 
homologs NocA, PbtH, TpdK and BerI, and the enzymatic assay suggest that the 
mechanistic studies on NosA present an intriguing paradigm about how NosA family 
members function during thiopeptide biosynthesis.

The duration of hemodialysis (HD) in methanol poisoning (MP) is dependent on the 
methanol concentration, the operational parameters used during HD, and the 
presence and severity of metabolic acidosis. However, methanol assays are not 
easily available, potentially leading to undue extension or premature 
termination of treatment. Here we provide a prediction model for the duration of 
high-efficiency HD in MP. In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 71 
episodes of MP in 55 individuals who were treated with alcohol dehydrogenase 
inhibition and HD. Four patients had residual visual abnormality at discharge 
and only one patient died. In 46 unique episodes of MP with high-efficiency HD 
the mean methanol elimination half-life (T1/2) during HD was 108 min in women, 
significantly different from the 129 min in men. In a training set of 28 
patients with MP, using the 90th percentile of gender-specific elimination T1/2 
(147 min in men and 141 min in women) and a target methanol concentration of 
4 mmol/l allowed all cases to reach a safe methanol of under 6 mmol/l. The 
prediction model was confirmed in a validation set of 18 patients with MP. 
High-efficiency HD time in hours can be estimated using 3.390 × (Ln (MCi/4)) for 
women and 3.534 × (Ln (MCi/4)) for men, where MCi is the initial methanol 
concentration in mmol/l, provided that metabolic acidosis is corrected.

OBJECTIVE: To review data on functional low vision (FLV) (low vision-visual 
acuity (VA) < 6/18 (<20/60) to > perception of light (PL+) in the better 
eye-that is untreatable and uncorrectable) in adults aged 50 years or older from 
published population-based surveys from 15 countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean.
METHODS: Data from 15 cross-sectional, population-based surveys on blindness and 
visual impairment (10 national and five subnational) covering 55 643 people > 50 
years old in 15 countries from 2003 to 2013 were reanalyzed to extract 
statistics on FLV. Eleven of the studies used the rapid assessment of avoidable
