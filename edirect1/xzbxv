INTRODUCTION: Recommendations for colorectal cancer screening encourage patients 
to choose among various screening methods based on individual preferences for 
benefits, risks, screening frequency, and discomfort. We devised a model to 
illustrate how individuals with varying tolerance for screening complications 
risk might decide on their preferred screening strategy.
METHODS: We developed a discrete-time Markov mathematical model that allowed 
hypothetical individuals to maximize expected lifetime utility by selecting 
screening method, start age, stop age, and frequency. Individuals could choose 
from stool-based testing every 1 to 3 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 1 to 
20 years with annual stool-based testing, colonoscopy every 1 to 20 years, or no 
screening. We compared the life expectancy gained from the chosen strategy with 
the life expectancy available from a benchmark strategy of decennial 
colonoscopy.
RESULTS: For an individual at average risk of colorectal cancer who was risk 
neutral with respect to screening complications (and therefore was willing to 
undergo screening if it would actuarially increase life expectancy), the model 
predicted that he or she would choose colonoscopy every 10 years, from age 53 to 
73 years, consistent with national guidelines. For a similar individual who was 
moderately averse to screening complications risk (and therefore required a 
greater increase in life expectancy to accept potential risks of colonoscopy), 
the model predicted that he or she would prefer flexible sigmoidoscopy every 12 
years with annual stool-based testing, with 93% of the life expectancy benefit 
of decennial colonoscopy. For an individual with higher risk aversion, the model 
predicted that he or she would prefer 2 lifetime flexible sigmoidoscopies, 20 
years apart, with 70% of the life expectancy benefit of decennial colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Mathematical models may formalize how individuals with different 
risk attitudes choose between various guideline-recommended colorectal cancer 
screening strategies.

Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is a fundamental surgical step in 
the treatment of testicular cancer. Nowadays, primary RPLND has partially lost 
its role in favour of active surveillance (for low risk stage I disease) and 
short cycle chemotherapy in non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). 
Conversely, post-chemotherapy RPLND (PC-RPLND) remains the standard treatment 
for residual masses after chemotherapy. In consideration of curability rate of 
testicular cancer and the life expectancy of testicular cancer survivors the 
identification and the prevention of andrological complications became 
fundamental. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is generally transitory and interests 
about 25% of patients, conversely retrograde ejaculation (RE) is definitive. 
Antegrade ejaculation is guaranteed by the sparing of at least one paravertebral 
sympathetic trunks and the postganglionic sympathetic fibers, which travel 
dorsal to the inferior vena cava and cross ventrally to the aorta. The 
maintenance of antegrade ejaculation can be obtained by a bilateral sparing of 
these fibers or by the modification of templates. In primary RPLND setting RE 
ranged between 2-6.7% and 1.2-61% in the major open and laparoscopic series 
respectively. In PC-RPLND series it ranged between 21-36% and 4-7.1% for open 
and laparoscopic approach respectively with the limitation of the restrictive 
indications of laparoscopic approach. The setting of this surgery and the 
importance of the oncological and functional outcomes that are pursued 
reinforced following the evidence that RPLND is a highly technical demanding 
procedure, whose best performances are achieved only when delivered in referral, 
high-volume centers.

Mortality, hospital days and expenditures attributable to ambient air pollution 
from particulate matter in Israel.

Jerusalem, 9446724 Israel.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, ambient air pollution accounts for around 3.7 million 
deaths annually. Measuring the burden of disease is important not just for 
advocacy but also is a first step towards carrying out a full cost-utility 
analysis in order to prioritise technological interventions that are available 
to reduce air pollution (and subsequent morbidity and mortality) from 
industrial, power generating and vehicular sources.
METHODS: We calculated the average national exposure to particulate matter 
particles less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in diameter by weighting readings from 52 
(non-roadside) monitoring stations by the population of the catchment area 
around the station. The PM2.5 exposure level was then multiplied by the gender 
and cause specific (Acute Lower Respiratory Infections, Asthma, Circulatory 
Diseases, Coronary Heart Failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, 
Diabetes, Ischemic Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Low Birth Weight, Respiratory 
Diseases and Stroke) relative risks and the national age, cause and gender 
specific mortality (and hospital utilisation which included neuro-degenerative 
disorders) rates to arrive at the estimated mortality and hospital days 
attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution in Israel in 2015. We utilised a WHO 
spread-sheet model, which was expanded to include relative risks (based on more 
recent meta-analyses) of sub-sets of other diagnoses in two additional models.
RESULTS: Mortality estimates from the three models were 1609, 1908 and 2253 
respectively in addition to 184,000, 348,000 and 542,000 days hospitalisation in 
general hospitals. Total costs from PM2.5 pollution (including premature burial 
costs) amounted to $544 million, $1030 million and $1749 million respectively 
(or 0.18 %, 0.35 % and 0.59 % of GNP).
CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the caveat that our estimates were based on a limited 
number of non-randomly sited stations exposure data. The mortality, morbidity 
and monetary burden of disease attributable to air pollution from particulate 
matter in Israel is of sufficient magnitude to warrant the consideration of and 
prioritisation of technological interventions that are available to reduce air 
pollution from industrial, power generating and vehicular sources. The accuracy 
of our burden estimates would be improved if more precise estimates of 
population exposure were to become available in the future.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of birth 
weight and infant growth with childhood autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity 
and to assess whether ANS activity mediates the associations of birth weight and 
infant growth with energy-balance-related behaviours, including energy intake, 
satiety response, physical activity and screen time.
METHODS: In 2089 children, we prospectively collected birth weight, infant 
growth defined as conditional weight and height gain between birth and 12 months 
and-at 5 years-indices of cardiac ANS activity and parent-reported 
energy-balance-related behaviours. A mediation analysis was conducted, based on 
MacKinnon's multivariate extension of the product-of-coefficients strategy.
RESULTS: Birth weight and infant height gain were inversely associated with 
sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, activity at age 5. Infant weight gain was 
not associated with childhood ANS activity. Infant weight gain was predictive of 
increased childhood screen time and infant height gain of diminished childhood 
energy intake, but sympathetic activity did not mediate these associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-birth-weight children have higher sympathetic activity, which 
is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Height gain in infancy 
seems to be beneficial for childhood sympathetic activity. However, sympathetic 
activity was no mediator of the associations of infant growth with childhood 
energy-balance-related behaviours. As individual differences in ANS activity 
predict increased risk of cardiovascular disease, these differences may offer 
insight into the early-life origins of chronic diseases and provide further 
basis for public health strategies to optimize birth weight and infant growth.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 2%-3% of the US population and is 
expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next 
decade. Bariatric surgery may be an effective but expensive treatment for NASH. 
Using a state-transition model, our analysis assessed the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of surgery to manage NASH. We simulated the benefits and 
harms of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients defined by 
weight class (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity) 
and fibrosis stage (F0-F3). Comparators included intensive lifestyle 
intervention (ILI) and no treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Our results showed 
that surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 
0.678-2.152 and 0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and 
$19,222/QALY, respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery 
increased QALYs by 0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164. In 
overweight patients, it was cost-effective to reserve treatment only for F3 
patients; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for providing surgery or ILI 
only to F3 patients were $30,484/QALY and $25,367/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was both effective and cost-effective for obese patients 
with NASH, regardless of fibrosis stage; in overweight patients, surgery 
increased QALYs for all patients regardless of fibrosis stage, but was 
cost-effective only for patients with F3 fibrosis; our results highlight the 
promise of bariatric surgery for treating NASH and underscore the need for 
clinical trials in this area. (Hepatology 2017;65:1156-1164).

BACKGROUND: Medical progress and the lifestyle modification have prolonged life 
expectancy, despite the development of chronic diseases. Support and care for 
older subjects are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed 
of family, friends and neighbors, who are essential in helping older persons to 
continue living at home. It has been shown that the extent and diversity of 
informal tasks may jeopardize the physical, mental and social wellbeing of 
caregivers.
METHODS/DESIGN: The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly cohort is to define, 
through a longitudinal study, profiles of caregivers of older patients with a 
diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, 
colorectal), neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease and similar diseases), neurovascular diseases (stroke), sensory diseases 
(age-related macular degeneration (AMD)) and heart disease (heart failure). 
Patients must be at least 60 years old and living in the region of 
Burgundy-Franche-Comte (France). By following the different phases of the 
caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be 
possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers, coping strategies, levels 
of anxiety and depression, social support and the extent of their burden. We 
will also evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the implementation of a 
pragmatic intervention by a social worker to help informal caregivers, through a 
randomized interventional trial nested in the cohort. Qualitative approaches 
aimed at studying the caregiver/patient relationship, and situations leading to 
breakdown of the caregiver relationship will be also undertaken.
DISCUSSION: Through an analytical and longitudinal definition of profiles of 
informal caregivers, this study will gather detailed information on their life 
courses and their health trajectory by identifying consequences associated with 
the concept of their role as carers. In addition, the randomized interventional 
trial will explore the relevance of the implementation of a supportive 
intervention by a social worker to help caregivers. These data will help to 
identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid 
and to propose new approaches to help caregivers. This study will provide the 
opportunity to identify the most relevant means of support adapted to 
caregivers, and provide an impulse for new health care policies.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification programs are partly evaluated for their 
usefulness.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and healthy 
lifestyle persistence of a self-management program (SMP) for patients with 
metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Thai health care settings.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on the basis of an 
intervention study of 90 patients with MetS randomly allocated to the SMP and 
control groups. A Markov model with the Difference-in-Difference method was used 
to predict the lifetime costs from a societal perspective and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), of which 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by 
bootstrapping. The cost-effectiveness analysis, along with healthy lifestyle 
persistence, was performed using the discount rate of 3% per annum. Parameter 
uncertainties were identified using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The lifetime costs tended to decrease in both groups. The SMP could 
save lifetime costs (-2310 baht; 95% CI -5960 to 1400) and gain QALYs (0.0098; 
95% CI -0.0003 to 0.0190), compared with ordinary care. The probability of 
cost-effectiveness was 99.4% from the Monte-Carlo simulation, and the program 
was deemed cost-effective at dropout rates below 69% per year as determined by 
the threshold of 160,000 baht per QALY gained. The cost of macrovascular 
complications was the most influencing variable for the overall incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: The SMP provided by the health care settings is marginally 
cost-effective, and the persistence results support the implementation of the 
program to minimize the complications and economic burden of patients with MetS.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures (OFs) in the elderly are common worldwide, 
and the predicted number of the aging population is increasing the burden of OF 
on health care systems.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the economic burden of OF in people older than 65 years 
in South Korea from a societal perspective.
METHODS: National Health Insurance claim databases were used to analyze health 
care utilization and medical costs of OF in the Korean population (49 million). 
We identified medical claims records with a diagnosis of OF and estimated the 
costs from 2007 to 2011.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, there were 244,798 patients with at least one 
medical insurance claim related to OF. Most patients had a single fracture 
(80%), whereas 20% of all patients had two or more. For fracture sites, 
vertebral fracture accounted for 75.6% of all fractures, followed by hip and 
wrist fractures. The societal cost of OF increased annually, from US $88.8 
million in 2007 to US $149.3 million in 2011. Among the entire cost, the direct 
medical cost was US $134.9 million in 2011, which includes the cost of treatment 
(US $91.2 million) and long-term care (US $48.1 million). The direct nonmedical 
cost was US $9.9 million in 2011. Costs associated with morbidity and mortality 
of OF were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden associated with OF in elderly is expected to 
rise with the predicted increase in life expectancy and the number of elderly in 
South Korea. Therefore, effective management of the disease is necessary to 
reduce the growth in the economic burden of OF.

[The special requirements of old age in terms of dying].

It is expected that the rising average life expectancy will leave ever more 
people with chronic progressive diseases of the body and brain. This then means 
not only having to deal with increasingly longer periods of care, but also 
possibly distinct neurocognitive disorders in the years prior to death and 
dying. The aim of this study is to report epidemiological data on the causes of 
death, as well as on the places of death. In addition, the attitudes and 
behaviour towards death and dying, as well as the different places of death will 
be discussed. Expecting support in the process of dying, as well as factors that 
have a more conducive effect on the internal processing of dying, are mentioned. 
At the same time, the attitudes and behaviours in respect of the accompaniment 
of dying people, which can be seen in the staff in clinical inpatient 
facilities, are addressed. Personal intense grappling with dying and death 
actually has a positive effect on these behaviours and attitudes. Finally, the 
contribution turns to the question of to what extent the theory of compression 
of morbidity may be perceived as valid, especially in view of the rising average 
life expectancy. It is emphasised that chronic diseases, even when no functional 
loss is present, place not only great demands on the patient, but also on the 
care system and financial resources. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that 
frailty can often cause mental disorders. Specific requirements with a view to 
the care of people with dementia are given.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (BE) is probably not 
cost-effective. A sub-population with BE at increased risk of high-grade 
dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) who could be targeted for 
cost-effective surveillance was sought.
METHODS: The outcome for BE surveillance from 2003 to 2012 in a structured 
program was reviewed. Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios for developing 
HGD or EAC were calculated. Risk stratification identified individuals who could 
be considered for exclusion from surveillance. A health-state transition Markov 
cohort model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of focusing on higher-risk 
individuals.
RESULTS: During 2067 person-years of follow-up of 640 patients, 17 individuals 
progressed to HGD or EAC (annual IR 0.8%). Individuals with columnar-lined 
esophagus (CLE) ≥2 cm had an annual IR of 1.2% and >8-fold increased relative 
risk of HGD or EAC, compared to CLE <2 cm [IR-0.14% (IRR 8.6, 95% CIs 
4.5-12.8)]. Limiting the surveillance cohort after the first endoscopy to 
individuals with CLE ≥2 cm, or dysplasia, followed by a further restriction 
after the second endoscopy-exclusion of patients without intestinal 
metaplasia-removed 296 (46%) patients, and 767 (37%) person-years from 
surveillance. Limiting surveillance to the remaining individuals reduced the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from US$60,858 to US$33,807 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Further restrictions were tested but failed 
to improve cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on stratification of risk, the number of patients requiring 
surveillance can be reduced by at least a third. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of US$50,000 per QALY, surveillance of higher-risk individuals becomes 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Improved eating quality is a major breeding target in japonica rice 
due to market demand. Consequently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for glossiness 
of cooked rice and amylose content associated with eating quality have received 
much research focus because of their importance in rice quality.
RESULTS: In this study, QTL associated with 12 grain quality traits were 
identified using 96 introgression lines (IL) of rice developed from an 
interspecific cross between the Korean elite O. sativa japonica cultivar 
'Hwaseong' and O. rufipogon over 7 years. QTL analyses indicated that QTL qDTH6 
for heading date, detected on chromosome 6 is associated with variance in grain 
traits. Most QTLs detected in this study clustered near the qDTH6 locus on 
chromosome 6, suggesting the effect of qDTH6. O. rufipogon alleles negatively 
affected grain quality traits except for a few QTLs, including qGCR9 for 
glossiness of cooked rice on chromosome 9. To characterize the effect of the O. 
rufipogon locus harboring qGCR9, four lines with a single but different O. 
rufipogon segment near qGCR9 were compared to Hwaseong. Three lines (O. 
rufipopgon ILs) having O. rufipogon segment between RM242 and RM245 in common 
showed higher glossiness of cooked rice than Hwaseong and the other line 
(Hwaseong IL), indicating that qGCR9 is located in the 3.4-Mb region between 
RM242 and RM245. Higher glossiness of cooked rice conferred by the O. rufipogon 
allele might be associated with protein content considering that three lines had 
lower protein content than Hwaseong (P < 0.1). These three O. rufipogon ILs 
showed higher yield than Hwaseong and Hwaseong IL due to increase in spikelets 
per panicle and grain weight indicating the linkage of qGCR9 and yield component 
QTLs.
CONCLUSION: The qGCR9 locus is of particular interest because of its 
independence from other undesirable grain quality traits in O. rufipogon. SSR 
markers linked to qGCR9 can be used to develop high-quality japonica lines and 
offer a starting point for map-based cloning of genes underlying this trait. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report to map a beneficial QTL for glossiness 
of cooked rice from a wild rice, O. rufipogon.

This study is to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and open thyroidectomy (OT) 
for benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) treatment. HRQoL and utility were assessed for 
404 BTN patients immediately before treatments (RFA:OT = 137:267) and at 6-month 
visit. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from societal perspective in 
the China context. Resource use (hospitalization, sick leaves) was collected. We 
used the net monetary benefit approach and computed cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves for RFA and OT. Sensitivity analyses of costs of RFA were 
performed. At 6-month visit, patients treated with RFA had significantly better 
HRQoL than patients treated with OT on general health (68.5 versus 66.7, 
P = 0.029), vitality (71.3 versus 67.5, P < 0.001) and mental health (80.9 
versus 79.3, P = 0.038). RFA was more effective than OT in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 0.01QALY/patient) but more expensive 
(US$823/patient). The probability that RFA would be cost effective at a 
US$50,000/QALY threshold was 15.5% in China, and it would be increased to 88.4% 
when price of the RFA device was lowered by 30%. RFA exhibited a significant 
improvement of HRQoL relative to OT, but is unlikely to be cost effective at its 
current price in short time.

The Need for Accurate Risk Prediction Models for Road Mapping, Shared Decision 
Making and Care Planning for the Elderly with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease.

Stryckers M, Nagler EV, Van Biesen W.

As people age, chronic kidney disease becomes more common, but it rarely leads 
to end-stage kidney disease. When it does, the choice between dialysis and 
conservative care can be daunting, as much depends on life expectancy and 
personal expectations of medical care. Shared decision making implies adequately 
informing patients about their options, and facilitating deliberation of the 
available information, such that decisions are tailored to the individual's 
values and preferences. Accurate estimations of one's risk of progression to 
end-stage kidney disease and death with or without dialysis are essential for 
shared decision making to be effective. Formal risk prediction models can help, 
provided they are externally validated, well-calibrated and discriminative; 
include unambiguous and measureable variables; and come with readily applicable 
equations or scores. Reliable, externally validated risk prediction models for 
progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease or mortality 
in frail elderly with or without chronic kidney disease are scant. Within this 
paper, we discuss a number of promising models, highlighting both the strengths 
and limitations physicians should understand for using them judiciously, and 
emphasize the need for external validation over new development for further 
advancing the field.

Body Size and Outcomes in Dialysis and Transplant Patients - Does it Matter?

Sever MS.

The terminologies of "body size", "body mass index (BMI)", "body weight", "large 
BMI" and "obesity" are controversial for defining the effects of "adiposity" or 
"fat excess" on the outcomes of dialysis and transplant patients. However, 
probably these terminologies will be continued to be used in the future as well, 
because of being older and simpler terminologies. In the general population 
obesity is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
while, it conferred a survival advantage to dialysis patients. However, this may 
be a oversimplification, since obesity may still be a risk factor in 
non-sarcopenic hemodialysis patients. Obesity is associated with early 
post-transplant adverse effects (i.e. delayed graft function, graft failure, 
wound infections, also transplant costs) and unfavorable graft and patient 
survival. However, thanks to safer immunosuppressive protocols, recently graft 
and patient survival is similar in obese as those of the non-obese patients. On 
the other hand, morbid obesity may still be a cause of unfavorable patient and 
graft survival. Since obese transplant recipients have better life expectancy as 
compared to wait-listed hemodialysis patients, they should be transplanted as 
well, while morbidly obese patients should be asked to lose weight before being 
placed in the waiting lists.

BACKGROUND: Longer life expectancy is associated with an increasing prevalence 
of kidney disease. Aging itself may cause renal damage, but the spectrum of 
kidney disorders that affect elderly patients is diverse. Few studies, mostly 
form US, Asia and West Europe found differences in the prevalence of some types 
of kidney diseases between elderly and younger patients based on renal biopsy 
findings, with varied proportion between glomerulopathies and 
arterionephrosclerosis as a dominant injury found. Here, for the first time in 
Eastern Europe we analyzed native kidney biopsy findings and their relationship 
to clinical characteristics at the time of biopsy in elderly individuals (aged 
≥65) in comparison to younger adults (aged 18-64).
METHODS: Biopsy and clinical data from 352 patients aged ≥65 were 
retrospectively identified, analyzed and compared with a control group of 2214 
individuals aged 18-64. All kidney biopsies studied were examined at Medical 
University of Warsaw in years 2009-14.
RESULTS: In elderly patients the leading indication for biopsy was nephrotic 
range proteinuria without hematuria (34.2%) and the most prevalent pathologic 
diagnoses were: membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) (18.2%), focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (17.3%) amyloidosis (13.9%) and pauci immune 
glomerulonephritis (12.8%). Hypertension and age-related lesions very rarely 
were found an exclusive or dominant finding in a kidney biopsy (1.7%) and a 
cause of proteinuria (1.1%) in elderly individuals. There were 18.2% diabetics 
among elderly individuals, and as much as 75% of them had no morphologic signs 
of diabetic kidney disease in the renal biopsy. Amyloidosis, MGN, pauci immune 
GN, crescentic GN and light and/or heavy chain deposition disease (LCDD/HCDD) 
were more frequent whereas IgA nephropathy (IgAN), lupus nephritis (LN) and thin 
basement membrane disease (TBMD) were less common among elderly than in younger 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria, a dominating manifestation in elderly patients 
subjected to kidney biopsy was most commonly related to glomerulopathies. The 
relatively high prevalence of potentially curative kidney diseases in elderly 
individuals implicates the importance of renal biopsy in these patients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty versus standard percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA).
BACKGROUND: Recent trials have reported lower rates of target lesion 
revascularization with DCB angioplasty versus standard PTA. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of DCB angioplasty is unknown.
METHODS: A prospective economic study was performed alongside the IN.PACT SFA II 
(IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the 
Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and Proximal Popliteal Artery 
[PPA]) trial, which randomized 181 patients with femoropopliteal disease to the 
IN.PACT DCB versus standard PTA. Resource use data were collected over 2-year 
follow-up, and costs were assigned using resource-based accounting and billing 
data. Health utilities were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensions 
questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained using a decision-analytic model on the basis of 
empirical data from the trial assuming identical long-term mortality.
RESULTS: Initial costs were $1,129 per patient higher with DCB angioplasty than 
standard PTA, driven by higher costs for the DCB itself. Between discharge and 
24 months, target limb-related costs were $1,212 per patient lower with DCB 
angioplasty such that discounted 2-year costs were similar for the 2 groups 
($11,277 vs. $11,359, p = 0.97), whereas QALYs tended to be greater among 
patients treated with DCBs (1.53 ± 0.44 vs. 1.47 ± 0.42, p = 0.40). The 
probability that DCB angioplasty is cost-effective compared with standard PTA 
was 70% using a threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained and 79% at a threshold of 
$150,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with femoropopliteal disease, DCB angioplasty is 
associated with better 2-year outcomes and similar target limb-related costs 
compared with standard PTA. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of 
these results suggests that use of the DCB angioplasty is likely to be 
economically attractive.

BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma brucei (T b) gambiense is targeted to reach elimination 
as a public health problem by 2020 and full elimination by 2030. To achieve 
these goals, stakeholders need to consider strategies to accelerate elimination. 
Hence, we aimed to model several options related to current and emerging methods 
for case detection, treatment, and vector control across settings to assess 
cost-effectiveness and the probability of elimination.
METHODS: Five intervention strategies were modelled over 30 years for low, 
moderate, and high transmission settings. Model parameters related to costs, 
efficacy, and transmission were based on available evidence and parameter 
estimation. Outcomes included disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), costs, and 
long-term prevalence. Sensitivity analyses were done to calculate the 
uncertainty of the results.
FINDINGS: To reach elimination targets for 2020 across all settings, approaches 
combining case detection, treatment, and vector control would be most effective. 
Elimination in high and moderate transmission areas was probable and 
cost-effective when strategies included vector control and novel methods, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from US$400 to $1500 per 
DALY averted. In low transmission areas, approaches including the newest 
interventions alone or in combination with tiny targets (vector control) were 
cost-effective, with ICERs of $200 or $1800 per DALY averted, respectively, but 
only strategies including vector control were likely to lead to elimination. 
Results of sensitivity analyses showed that allowing for biennial surveillance, 
reducing vector control maintenance costs, or variations of active surveillance 
coverage could also be cost-effective options for elimination, depending on the 
setting.
INTERPRETATION: Although various strategies might lead to elimination of T b 
gambiense, cost-effective approaches will include adoption of emerging 
technologies and, in some settings, increased surveillance or implementation of 
vector control.

OBJECTIVES: This article systematically reviews research on the costs of sepsis 
and, as a secondary aim, evaluates the quality of economic evaluations reported 
in peer-reviewed journals.
METHODS: We systematically searched the MEDLINE, National Health Service 
(Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Economic Evaluation and Health Technology 
Assessment), Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Knowledge databases 
for studies published between January 2005 and June 2015. We selected original 
articles that provided cost and cost-effectiveness analyses, defined sepsis and 
described their cost calculation method. Only studies that considered index 
admissions and re-admissions in the first 30 days were published in 
peer-reviewed journals and used standard treatments were considered. All costs 
were adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for 
various costs of sepsis were calculated. The quality of economic studies was 
assessed using the Drummond 10-item checklist.
RESULTS: Overall, 37 studies met our eligibility criteria. The median of the 
mean hospital-wide cost of sepsis per patient was $32,421 (IQR $20,745-$40,835), 
and the median of the mean ICU cost of sepsis per patient was $27,461 (IQR 
$16,007-$31,251). Overall, the quality of economic studies was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of the hospital-related costs of sepsis varied 
considerably across the included studies depending on the method used for cost 
calculation, the type of sepsis and the population that was examined. A standard 
model for conducting cost improve the quality of studies on the costs of sepsis.

Although the importance of ophthalmologic screening in diabetic patients is 
widely recognized by clinicians, the cost-effectiveness of strategies aimed at 
improving eye care utilization in this population is not well established. A 
cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing behavior activation (BA) to 
supportive therapy (ST) in activating patients to receive a dilated fundus exam 
(DFE) and promoting healthy management of diabetes. Two hundred six subjects 
were randomized to receive either BA or ST between 2009 and 2013. 
Cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of BA versus ST. Total costs for BA and ST per participant were $259.02 and 
$216.12, respectively. At the 6-month follow-up, 87.91% of BA subjects received 
a DFE compared to 34.48% of ST subjects. The ICER for BA versus ST was 
$80.29/percent increase in DFE rate. In terms of improving DFE rates, BA was 
found to be more cost-effective than ST.

PURPOSE: With growing older population and increasing rates of cervical spinal 
surgery, it is vital to understand the value of cervical surgery in this 
population. We set forth to determine the cost utility following anterior 
cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative disease in older 
patients.
METHODS: Patients undergoing ACDF for degenerative diseases were enrolled into 
prospective longitudinal registry. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were 
recorded at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year postoperatively. Two-year medical 
resource utilization, missed work, and health-state values [quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs)] were assessed to compute cost per QALY gained. Patients were 
dichotomized based on age: <65 years (younger) and ≥65 years (older) to compare 
the cost utility in these age groups.
