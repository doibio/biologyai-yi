Numerous proteins directly or indirectly bind membranes to exert their roles in 
a wide variety of biological processes. Such membrane binding often occurs in 
the presence of an external mechanical force. It remains challenging to quantify 
these interactions using traditional experimental approaches based on a large 
number of molecules, due to ensemble averaging or the lack of mechanical force. 
Here we described a new single-molecule approach based on high-resolution 
optical tweezers to characterize protein-membrane interactions. A single 
membrane binding protein is attached to the lipid bilayer coated on a silica 
bead via a flexible polypeptide linker, tethered to another bead via a long DNA 
handle, and pulled away from the bilayer using optical tweezers. Dynamic protein 
binding and unbinding is detected by the corresponding changes in the extension 
of the protein-DNA tether with high spatiotemporal resolution, which reveals the 
membrane binding affinity, kinetics, and intermediates. We demonstrated the 
method using C2 domains of extended synaptotagmin 2 (E-Syt2) with a detailed 
protocol. The method can be widely applied to investigate complex 
protein-membrane interactions under well-controlled experimental conditions.

INTRODUCTION: We assessed the association between hemoglobin A1c time in range 
(A1c TIR), based on unique patient-level A1c target ranges, with risks of 
developing microvascular and macrovascular complications in older adults with 
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a retrospective observational study design 
and identified patients with diabetes from the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(n=397 634). Patients were 65 years and older and enrolled in Medicare during 
the period 2004-2016. Patients were assigned to individualized A1c target ranges 
based on estimated life expectancy and the presence or absence of diabetes 
complications. We computed A1c TIR for patients with at least four A1c tests 
during a 3-year baseline period. The association between A1c TIR and time to 
incident microvascular and macrovascular complications was studied in models 
that included A1c mean and A1c SD.
RESULTS: We identified 74 016 patients to assess for incident microvascular 
complications and 89 625 patients to assess for macrovascular complications 
during an average follow-up of 5.5 years. Cox proportional hazards models showed 
lower A1c TIR was associated with higher risk of microvascular (A1c TIR 0% to 
<20%; HR=1.04; 95%) and macrovascular complications (A1c TIR 0% to <20%; 
HR=1.07; 95%). A1c mean was associated with increased risk of microvascular and 
macrovascular complications but A1c SD was not. The association of A1c TIR with 
incidence and progression of individual diabetes complications within the 
microvascular and macrovascular composites showed similar trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining stability of A1c levels in unique target ranges was 
associated with lower likelihood of developing microvascular and macrovascular 
complications in older adults with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: In many organisms, aging is characterized by a loss of mitochondrial 
homeostasis. Multiple factors such as respiratory metabolism, mitochondrial 
fusion/fission, or mitophagy have been linked to cell longevity, but the exact 
impact of each one on the aging process is still unclear.
RESULTS: Using the deletion mutant collection of the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we have developed a genome-wide screening for mutants 
with altered chronological lifespan. We have identified four mutants associated 
with proteolysis at the mitochondria that exhibit opposite effects on longevity. 
The analysis of the respiratory activity of these mutants revealed a positive 
correlation between increased respiration rate and prolonged lifespan. We also 
found that the phenotype of the long-lived protease mutants could not be 
explained by impaired mitochondrial fusion/fission activities, but it was 
dependent on mitophagy induction. The anti-aging role of mitophagy was supported 
by the effect of a mutant defective in degradation of mitochondria, which 
shortened lifespan of the long-lived mutants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our characterization of the mitochondrial protease mutants 
demonstrates that mitophagy sustains the lifespan extension of long-lived 
mutants displaying a higher respiration potential.

The world, addressing to achieve rapid and drastic economic growth by relying on 
fossil fuel energy consumption, could increase already increasing level of 
carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, there is a growing consensus that environmental 
sustainability by using renewable energy is the only option to avoid 
environmental calamity. Therefore, according to the authors' best knowledge, 
this is the first work to look into the short and long-run nexus between 
economic growth, trade openness, renewable and fossil fuel energy consumption, 
along with gross capital formation, population growth, and life expectancy as 
additional variables in top 10 highest renewable energy-using (TRU) economies 
and top 10 highest fossil fuel-using (TFU) economies from 1991 to 2020, by 
employing advanced panel data econometric approach. After demonstrating 
cross-sectional dependency in panel data, the Westerlund cointegration test 
verifies the long-term link between the variables. A cross-sectional 
autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) econometric technique is used to show 
short- and long-run coefficient values. CS-ARDL estimates confirm that the 
economic growth, fossil fuel energy, trade openness, and gross capital formation 
increase carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels in the short run for TRU and FEU 
economies, except for gross capital formation for FEU economies. However, 
economic growth adds to CO2 emissions for only TRU economies, while fossil fuel 
energy consumption enhances CO2 emissions for both groups of economies in the 
long run. On the contrary, renewable energy reduces CO2 emissions in the short 
and long run, while human capital in only the short run. The inferences of this 
study present new intuitions and urge governments and policymakers to develop a 
reliable mechanism for investing capital to diversify the energy portfolio 
through the energy transition process to attain sustainable economic growth and 
promote awareness campaigns to draw the attention of human capital to 
environmentally friendly, clean, and green energy sources. Overall, the results 
recommended energy efficiency usage and ecological friendly innovative 
technologies to enhance and protect environmental quality.

Including health outcomes for carers as well as patients in economic evaluations 
can change the results and conclusions of the analysis. Whilst in many disease 
areas there can be clear justification for including carers' health-related 
quality of life (HRQL) in health technology assessments (HTAs), we believe that, 
in general, the perspective of carers is under-represented in HTA. We were 
interested in the extent, and methods by which, HTA bodies include carers' HRQL 
in economic evaluation. We reviewed guidance from 13 HTA bodies across the world 
regarding carers' HRQL. We examined five interventions, as case studies, 
assessed by different HTA bodies, and extracted information on whether carers' 
HRQL was included by the manufacturers or assessors in their dossiers of 
evidence, the data and methods used, and the impact on the results. We developed 
recommendations to guide analysts on including carers' HRQL in economic 
evaluations. When reviewing the methods guides: two bodies recommend including 
carers' HRQL in the base case, two referred to outcomes for all individuals, two 
preferred to exclude carers, three said it depended on other conditions, and it 
was unclear for four. Across the five case studies: five source studies for 
carers' HRQL and two different modelling approaches were used. Including carers' 
HRQL increased incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in 19/23 analyses 
(decreased it in two); there was substantial variation in the magnitude of 
change. We recommend: (1) the inclusion of carers is clearly justified, (2) the 
use of HRQL data from the population under comparison where possible, (3) the 
use of data from another disease area or country is clearly justified (and 
transferability/applicability issues are discussed), (4) the use of external 
data to derive comparisons for cross-sectional data is justified, (5) 
assumptions and implications of the modelling approach are explicit, and (6) 
disaggregated results for patients and carers are presented.

Diabetes is an increasingly common chronic metabolic disorder in children 
worldwide. The discovery of insulin in 1921 resulted in unprecedented 
advancements that improved the lives of children and youth with diabetes. The 
purpose of this article is to review the history of diabetes in children and 
youth over the last century and its implications for future developments in the 
field. We identified 68 relevant events between 1921 and 2021 through literature 
review and survey of pediatric endocrinologists. Basic research milestones led 
to the discovery of insulin and other regulatory hormones, established the 
normal physiology of carbohydrate metabolism and pathophysiology of diabetes, 
and provided insight into strategies for diabetes prevention. While landmark 
clinical studies were initially focused on adult diabetes populations, later 
studies assessed etiologic factors in birth cohort studies, evaluated technology 
use among children with diabetes, and investigated pharmacologic management of 
youth type 2 diabetes. Technological innovations culminated in the introduction 
of continuous glucose monitoring that enabled semi-automated insulin delivery 
systems. Finally, professional organizations collaborated with patient groups to 
advocate for the needs of children with diabetes and their families. Together, 
these advances transformed type 1 diabetes from a terminal illness to a 
manageable disease with near-normal life expectancy and increased our knowledge 
of type 2 diabetes and other forms of diabetes in the pediatric population. 
However, disparities in access to insulin, diabetes technology, education, and 
care support remain and disproportionately impact minority youth and communities 
with less resources. The overarching goal of diabetes management remains 
promoting a high quality of life and improving glycemic management without 
undermining the psychological health of children and youth living with diabetes.

The human LIPA gene encodes for the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase, which 
hydrolyzes cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol. Lysosomal acid lipase 
deficiency results in Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease. The 
Drosophila genome encodes for two LIPA orthologs, Magro and Lipase 3. Magro is a 
gut lipase that hydrolyzes triacylglycerides, while Lipase 3 lacks 
characterization based on mutant phenotypes. We found previously that Lipase 3 
transcription is highly induced in mutants with defects in peroxisome 
biogenesis, but the conditions that allow a similar induction in wildtypic flies 
are not known. Here we show that Lipase 3 is drastically upregulated in starved 
larvae and starved female flies, as well as in aged male flies. We generated a 
lipase 3 mutant that shows sex-specific starvation resistance and a trend to 
lifespan extension. Using lipidomics, we demonstrate that Lipase 3 mutants 
accumulate phosphatidylinositol, but neither triacylglycerol nor diacylglycerol. 
Our study suggests that, in contrast to its mammalian homolog LIPA, Lipase 3 is 
a putative phospholipase that is upregulated under extreme conditions like 
prolonged nutrient deprivation and aging.

Context: Good health and longevity depend on dynamic interactions between 
biological, social, psychological, and environmental factors. Aging is globally 
a big challenge, particularly with the demographic transition, including 
population growth, and an emerging burden to society. Knowledge, behavior, diet, 
and consumption of animal source food were related to aging and emerged as the 
key factors modulating healthy aging. Objective: The study was designed to 
understand the main healthy aging factors, such as knowledge, social network, 
and diet of elders, and to derive mutual learning from it for healthy aging. 
Methods: A qualitative approach has been applied to explore health-related 
knowledge, attitude, and diet of elders from Ebetsu (Japan) and Tiassalé (Côte 
d'Ivoire) health districts, using focus group discussions and comparative 
context analysis between high- and low-income countries. Results: The study 
shows that living longer is a common feature of people in Japan compared to Côte 
d'Ivoire, where the life expectancy is still low. Both groups of elders have 
social networks that support them, and both offer their gained experience to 
society. While Japanese elders depend on pension and insurance for income and 
medical treatments, Ivorians depend mostly on their children and social network 
in old age. The worries of elders differ between the two regions. In Ebetsu, 
elder members of the community are concerned about the future burden they pose 
for the younger generation if they develop ill-health, making them more 
resilient to aging. In Taabo, elders are considered to be culturally and 
socially useful to the society. Elders in Ebetsu pointed out that for healthy 
aging, education on diet at a younger age, physical activities, and access to 
basic social services are the key aspects. This was not observed in Taabo's 
context. Being inactive and dependent on others were described as the most 
worrying situations for elders in Ebetsu, as it is perceived to increase the 
risk of non-communicable diseases and anxiety. Elders in Ebetsu have good 
knowledge on what constitutes a healthy diet, and they believe that diversifying 
their diet, reducing portions, and substituting red meat with good animal and 
vegetable proteins are best eating practices to maintain good health. In Côte 
d'Ivoire, the diet is imbalanced and the whole family consumes the same meal 
made mainly with high-energy staples and little protein. However, it is observed 
in both societies that adopting a good diet is very expensive. Conclusion: The 
consciousness of aging is universal, but healthy aging varies according to the 
social systems, education, and knowledge on diet transition. Physical 
activities, protein-energy balance in diet, and social networks are the key for 
healthy aging in both contexts. The challenge is to find ways to increase 
knowledge regarding healthy aging and to strengthen the support system so that 
healthy aging becomes affordable.

Increasing scientific interest has been directed to sex as a biological and 
decisive factor on several diseases. Several different mechanisms orchestrate 
vascular function, as well as vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular and 
metabolic diseases in males and females. Certain vascular sex differences are 
present throughout life, while others are more evident before the menopause, 
suggesting two important and correlated drivers: genetic and hormonal factors. 
With the increasing life expectancy and aging population, studies on 
aging-related diseases and aging-related physiological changes have steeply 
grown and, with them, the use of aging animal models. Mouse and rat models of 
aging, the most studied laboratory animals in aging research, exhibit sex 
differences in many systems and physiological functions, as well as sex 
differences in the aging process and aging-associated cardiovascular changes. In 
the present review, we introduce the most common aging and 
senescence-accelerated animal models and emphasize that sex is a biological 
variable that should be considered in aging studies. Sex differences in the 
cardiovascular system, with a focus on sex differences in aging-associated 
vascular alterations (endothelial dysfunction, remodeling and oxidative and 
inflammatory processes) in these animal models are reviewed and discussed.

Growing life expectancy will contribute to the on-going shift towards a world 
population increasingly comprised of elderly individuals. This demographic shift 
is associated with a rising prevalence of age-related diseases, among all 
age-related pathologies it has become crucial to understand the age-associated 
cognitive changes that remain a major risk factor for the development of 
vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Furthermore, age-related 
Alzheimer's disease and other neurogenerative diseases with vascular etiology 
are the most prominent contributing factors for the loss of cognitive function 
observed in aging. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) achieves physiologic effects 
by increasing oxygen tension (PO2), raising oxygen tissue levels, decreasing 
intracranial pressure and relieving cerebral edema. Many of the beneficial 
effects of HBOT exert their protective effects at the level of the 
microcirculation. Furthermore, the microcirculation's exquisite pervasive 
presence across every tissue in the body, renders it uniquely able to influence 
the local environment of most tissues and organs, including the brain. As such, 
treatments aimed at restoring aging-induced functional and structural 
alterations of the cerebral microcirculation may potentially contribute to the 
amelioration of a range of age-related pathologies including vascular cognitive 
impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementias. Despite the presented 
evidence, the efficacy and safety of HBOT for the treatment of age-related 
vascular cognitive impairment and dementia remains understudied. The present 
review aims to examine the existing evidence indicative of a potential 
therapeutic role for HBOT-induced hyperoxia against age-related 
cerebromicrovascular pathologies contributing to cognitive impairment, dementia 
and decreased healthspan in the elderly.

Toll-Like Receptors Represent an Important Link for Sex Differences in 
Cardiovascular Aging and Diseases.

São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

Human life span expectancy has increased, and aging affects the organism in 
several ways, leading, for example, to an increased risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. Age-adjusted prevalence of the cardiovascular diseases is higher in 
males than females. Aging also affects the gonadal sex hormones and the sex 
differences observed in cardiovascular diseases may be therefore impacted. 
Hormonal changes associated with aging may also affect the immune system and the 
immune response is sexually different. The immune system plays a role in the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors of the immune system whose 
activation induces the synthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules. They are 
expressed throughout the cardiovascular system and their activation has been 
widely described in cardiovascular diseases. Some recent evidence demonstrates 
that there are sex differences associated with TLR responses and that these 
receptors may be affected by sex hormones and their receptors, suggesting that 
TLRs may contribute to the sex differences observed in cardiovascular diseases. 
Recent evidence also shows that sex differences of TLRs in cardiovascular system 
persists with aging, which may represent a new paradigm about the mechanisms 
that contribute to the sex differences in cardiovascular aging. Therefore, in 
this mini review we describe the latest findings regarding the sex differences 
of TLRs and associated signaling in cardiovascular diseases during aging.

Targeted nucleases are powerful genomic tools to precisely change the target 
genome of living cells, controlling functional genes with high exactness. The 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 
(CRISPR-Cas9) genome editing system has been identified as one of the most 
useful biological tools in genetic engineering that is taken from adaptive 
immune strategies for bacteria. In recent years, this system has made 
significant progress and it has been widely used in genome editing to create 
gene knock-ins, knock-outs, and point mutations. This paper summarizes the 
application of this system in various biological sciences, including medicine, 
plant science, and animal breeding.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
bimekizumab in active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: Adult patients with active PsA who completed the double- and dose-blind 
periods of the BE ACTIVE randomized controlled trial were eligible to enroll in 
the open-label extension (OLE) study at week 48, after which patients received 
160 mg of bimekizumab every 4 weeks. Safety and efficacy results are presented 
through 152 weeks.
RESULTS: At week 152, 161 of 206 patients (78.2%) remained in the study. From 
weeks 0-152, 184 of 206 patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
(126.4 per 100 patient-years). The most frequent events were nasopharyngitis 
(7.6 per 100 patient-years), upper respiratory tract infection (6.8 per 100 
patient-years), bronchitis (3.5 per 100 patient-years), and oral candidiasis 
(3.5 per 100 patient-years). Additionally, 47 of 206 patients had mild to 
moderate localized fungal infections (9.7 per 100 patient-years), including 24 
of 206 patients who had Candida infections (4.6 per 100 patient years) and 19 of 
206 patients who had oral candidiasis (3.5 per 100 patient years). Four patients 
had serious infections (0.7 per 100 patient-years); there were no reported cases 
of active tuberculosis, adjudicated major adverse cardiac events, or deaths. 
Efficacy demonstrated at week 48 was sustained in the OLE study. At week 152, 
nonresponder imputation analysis showed that 52.9% of patients (69.4% of 
observed cases) achieved the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 50% 
improvement, 57.7% (73.8% of observed cases) achieved 100% skin clearance per 
the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and 51.5% (67.5% of observed cases) 
achieved minimal disease activity. Patients also maintained improvements in 
pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: The safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with previous 
reports, with no new safety signals identified. Sustained joint and efficacy 
responses were observed over 3 years.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
bimekizumab in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: Patients with active AS who completed the dose-ranging, 48-week BE 
AGILE randomized controlled trial were eligible to participate in an open-label 
extension (OLE) study, in which patients received 160 mg of bimekizumab every 
4 weeks. We present the safety and efficacy results through 156 weeks. Missing 
efficacy data were imputed using nonresponder imputation analysis for binary 
outcomes and multiple imputation for continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: From weeks 0-156, 280 of 303 patients (exposure-adjusted incidence rate 
141.0 per 100 patient-years) experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event; 
the most frequent adverse events were nasopharyngitis (8.1 per 100 
patient-years) and upper respiratory tract infection (5.0 per 100 
patient-years). Additionally, 67 of 303 patients (9.8 per 100 patient-years) had 
mild to moderate localized fungal infections (28 of 303 patients had Candida 
infections [3.7 per 100 patient-years] and 23 of 303 patients had oral 
candidiasis [3.0 per 100 patient-years]), 10 patients had serious infections 
(1.3 per 100 patient-years), and no cases of active tuberculosis were reported. 
Active inflammatory bowel disease (1.1 per 100 patient-years), anterior uveitis 
(0.7 per 100 patient-years), and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events 
(0.3 per 100 patient-years) were infrequent. The efficacy of bimekizumab 
treatment demonstrated at week 48 was sustained in the OLE study. At week 156, 
nonresponder imputation analysis showed that 53.7% of patients (72.6% of 
observed cases) met the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 
criteria for 40% improvement and 28.0% of patients (37.9% of observed cases) 
achieved partial remission; Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Scores were 
reduced from baseline (mean ± SEM 3.9 ± 0.1) to week 48 (2.1 ± 0.1) and week 156 
(1.9 ± 0.1) (multiple imputation). Patients showed sustained improvements in 
pain, fatigue, physical function, and health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: The safety profile of bimekizumab was found to be consistent with 
previously demonstrated findings, and no new safety signals were identified. The 
efficacy of bimekizumab in patients with AS was sustained through 3 years of 
treatment.

With the increase in the population's life expectancy and the higher frequency 
of risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes, an increase in the 
prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is 
expected. However, to date, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HFpEF 
remain challenging. The syndromic diagnosis of HFpEF includes several etiologies 
and diseases with specific treatments but has points in common regarding the 
clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation related to biomarkers, such as BNP 
and NT-ProBNP, and echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac remodeling and left 
ventricular diastolic filling pressures. Extensive randomized clinical trials 
involving the treatment of this condition have failed to demonstrate benefits to 
the patient, making it necessary to reflect on the diagnosis, mechanisms of 
morbidity, mortality and reversibility in this syndrome. In this review, the 
current concepts, controversies and challenges, especially regarding diagnosis, 
will be addressed, critically analyzing the European Heart Failure Association 
score for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatitis is a common disease of the digestive system. Acute 
pancreatitis is one of the most common reasons for gastrointestinal hospital 
admission, and chronic pancreatitis significantly reduces quality of life. 
However, national epidemiological data on pancreatitis in China are lacking. 
This study aimed to quantify the disease burden of pancreatitis in China from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This study was based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
dataset. Age-standardized rates of incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), 
mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were used to 
describe the disease burden of pancreatitis, and estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC) was used to indicate the average change in age-standardized rates. 
We also described the trend of pancreatitis-related mortality and DALYs, which 
are attributable to alcohol use by age and sex.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, and age-standardized DALYs of 
pancreatitis in China decreased by 10.90, 1.50, 0.49, and 15.54 per 100,000, 
respectively, with EAPCs of -1.35 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: -1.67, -1.02) 
and -0.37 (95% UI: -0.43, -0.31), -2.01 (95% UI: -2.07, -1.94) and -2.32 (95% 
UI: -2.37, -2.28), respectively. Recently, the numbers of incident and prevalent 
cases have risen, with estimates of 380,018 (95% UI: 308,669-462,767) and 
493,765 (95% UI: 416,705-578,675), respectively, in 2019. Among men, the disease 
burden of pancreatitis was more severe than among women, and with variances in 
the distribution among different age groups. Age-standardized DALYs caused by 
alcohol-related pancreatitis have gradually worsened in the past decade, 
accounting for 34.09% of the total in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of pancreatitis in China has declined in the 
past 30 years, but the exacerbation of population aging poses a challenge to 
prevention and control of pancreatitis. Alcohol use has gradually become an 
important factor in the disease burden of pancreatitis in recent years.

The (Im)precision of Life Expectancy Numbers.

Hanley JA(1).

Author information:
(1)The author is with the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill 
University, Montreal, Canada.

Life expectancy figures for countries and population segments are increasingly 
being reported to more decimal places and used as indicators of the strengths or 
failings of countries' health and social systems. Reports seldom quantify their 
intrinsic statistical imprecision or the age-specific numbers of deaths that 
determine them. The SE formulas available to compute imprecision are all model 
based. This note adds a more intuitive data-based SE method and extends the 
jackknife to the analysis of event rates more generally. It also describes the 
relationships between the magnitude of the SE and the numbers of person-years 
and deaths on which it is based. These relationships can help quantify the 
statistical noise present in published year-to-year differences in life 
expectancies, as well as in same-year differences between or within countries. 
Agencies and investigators are encouraged to use one of these SEs to report the 
imprecision of life expectancy numbers and to tailor the number of decimal 
places accordingly. (Am J Public Health. 2022;112(8):1151-1160.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prescription patterns of drugs 
during the last year of life in homebound older adults who received home medical 
care.
METHODS: We used a nationwide claims database in Japan and selected older adults 
aged ≥75 years who received home medical care services from ≥12 months before 
their death. We evaluated medications prescribed 12 months before death (month 
12), 3 months before death (month 3) and in the last month of life (month 1). We 
explored the factors associated with the decreased number of cardiovascular 
preventive drugs from month 12 to both month 3 and month 1.
RESULTS: A total of 118 661 participants were included, and the majority were 
aged ≥90 years and women. The prevalence of cardiovascular preventive drugs 
decreased but remained common in month 1, which included antihypertensives 
(34.7%), antiplatelets (15.9%), oral anticoagulants (7.6%), antidiabetic drugs 
(7.3%) and lipid-lowering drugs (6.1%). The relative decrease from month 12 to 
month 1 was the largest for lipid-lowering drugs (44.8%) and the smallest for 
oral anticoagulants (13.6%). Among other drugs, laxatives (enema), antiemetics, 
oral corticosteroids, analgesics, expectorants, bronchodilators and antibiotics 
showed a large relative increase. Older age, duration of home medical care 
services for <1 year and diagnoses of cancer, dementia and Parkinson's disease 
were associated with a greater likelihood of a decreased number of 
cardiovascular preventive drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: There is room for deprescribing to avoid inappropriate polypharmacy 
by balancing preventive and symptom management drugs in those receiving home 
medical care with a limited life expectancy.
