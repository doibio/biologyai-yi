end of life.
AIM: To explore, in a sample of Australian GPs, their perceptions of best 
practice palliative care and their ideal role in its delivery.
DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative interview study of 25 GPs practising in 
metropolitan and non-metropolitan locations in New South Wales, Australia.
METHOD: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Data were analysed 
using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 51 years, and had practised between 3 
and 38 years (mean 19 years). Best practice palliative care was perceived to be 
proactive and responsive to a wide range of patient and family needs. Many 
participants indicated a need for relational continuity, which involves GPs 
establishing a care pathway from diagnosis to palliation, coordinating care 
across the pathway, and collaborating with other healthcare providers. A number 
of participants perceived palliative care as a natural extension of primary care 
and indicated that best practice palliative care mainly requires experiential 
knowledge and good communication skills, rather than specialised medical 
knowledge. Participants listed a number of communication strategies to offer 
patients and their families choice and ongoing negotiation about the recommended 
treatments.
CONCLUSION: This study provides novel in-depth insights into GPs' perceptions of 
best practice palliative care. Future research should further investigate the 
identified features of care, and whether they can maximise the outcomes of 
patients and their families.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma offers poor long-term survival prospects. We report the final analysis 
from our study of the immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus 
chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial 
(ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. We enrolled patients aged 20 
years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or 
non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
version 1.1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 
0-1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous 
fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy 
of at least 3 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab 
(240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week 
off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given 
intravenously. Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the 
investigator per RECIST version 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was 
done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and 
stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number 
of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression. Patients and investigators were 
not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, 
defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the 
intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients. 
Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the 
assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02569242, and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to 
treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy. At the time of data cutoff 
on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 
4·5-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·2) in the chemotherapy 
group. At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last 
patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly 
improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 
10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2-9·9; hazard ratio for death 
0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019). 38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab 
group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) 
of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 
treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group 
and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group. Five deaths 
were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of 
interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group 
(one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).
INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in 
overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in 
previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 
and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Depressive symptoms are associated with sickness absence, work 
disability and unemployment, but little is known about worklife expectancy 
(WLE). This study investigates the impact of depressive symptoms on the WLE of a 
large sample of Danish employees.
METHODS: We used occupational health survey data of 11 967 Danish employees from 
2010 and linked them with register data on salary and transfer payments from 
2010 to 2015. Depressive symptoms were self-reported using the Major Depression 
Inventory. We used multistate data and a life table approach with Cox 
proportional hazard modelling to estimate the WLE of employees, expressed by 
time in work, unemployment and sickness absence. Separate analyses were 
conducted for sex and employees with a voluntary early retirement pension 
scheme. Using age as time axis, we used inverse probability weights to account 
for differences in educational level, sector, body mass index, smoking habits 
and loss of employment during sickness absence.
RESULTS: The WLE of employees reporting depressive symptoms was shorter compared 
with those not reporting depressive symptoms; that is, the expected time in 
unemployment and sickness absence was longer, while the expected time in work 
was shorter. The shorter WLE was most pronounced in women; for example, a 
40-year-old woman with depressive symptoms can expect 3.3 years less in work, 
0.8 years more in unemployment and 0.7 years more in sickness absence. Employees 
with a voluntary early retirement pension scheme showed an even lower WLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a meaningful impact of depressive symptoms on the 
WLE of Danish employees using a multistate framework.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common endocrine disorders 
in dogs, but prognostic factors are still largely unknown. The aim of this 
retrospective, single-centre, case series study was to determine overall 
survival time and identify the prognostic value of several clinical and 
clinicopathological variables in dogs with newly diagnosed DM.
METHODS: Cases of DM were identified within the electronic medical records of 
one referral centre. Sixty-eight dogs with DM were included. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to analyse variables associated with survival.
RESULTS: The median survival time was 964 days (range 22-3140). In multivariable 
model analysis, length of survival was significantly shorter for dogs with 
higher haematocrit value (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95 per cent confidence 
interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.13) and higher serum phosphate concentrations (HR 1.83, 
95 per cent CI 1.13 to 2.97). Serum phosphate concentrations were above the 
reference interval in 24 of 65 (37 per cent) dogs.
CONCLUSION: Diabetic dogs have a good life expectancy. Hyperphosphataemia is a 
relatively common finding in dogs with newly diagnosed DM and represents a 
negative prognostic factor. The presence of pancreatitis might not be associated 
with an unfavourable outcome.

BACKGROUND: Isolated brain metastasis (IBM) from cervical cancer is a very rare 
encounter in neurosurgery. We sought to understand how patients with isolated 
brain metastases differ from those with metastases in the setting of widespread 
disease.
METHODS: A systematic review was completed using PubMed and the Cochrane 
Library. Patients with isolated brain metastases (IBM) and non-isolated brain 
metastases (NIBM, or brain metastases in the setting of disseminated disease), 
were compared. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine significance. 
Survival function was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients, 25 with IBM and 64 with NIBM, were identified. 
The time interval between initial diagnosis of cervical cancer and diagnosis of 
brain lesion was significantly shorter in the IBM group (median 7.5 vs. 20.05 
months, and IBM vs. NIBM, respectively; P = 0.006). Overall survival from 
initial diagnosis of cervical cancer was significantly shorter for the IBM group 
versus the NIBM group (7.63 vs. 26.3 months, respectively; P = 0.0005). Data 
demonstrate a 3.4-fold reduction of median life expectancy to 7.63 months. 
Survival after diagnosis of brain metastases did not differ between groups 
(median, IBM 7 months vs. NIBM 4 months, P = 0.08).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that for cervical cancer patients 
with brain metastasis intracranial metastasis itself (and not overall tumor 
burden) represent a sentinel event in limiting longevity. While the present 
study is underpowered to compare treatment options directly, further work should 
be focused on determining the optimal treatment for these patients.

Utilizing the Great Ape Information Network (GAIN), an open-access nationwide 
database containing the detailed life history information of all apes who have 
lived or currently reside in Japan, we present a robust chimpanzee life table by 
single year of age and sex including 821 individuals spanning nearly a century, 
current through March 11, 2019. While the demographic composition and status of 
captive chimpanzees in Japan has been previously reported, longevity and 
mortality statistics have not. We show that female and male survivorship do not 
differ significantly, and that a live-born chimpanzee in Japan can expect to 
live 28.3 years (females 26.3, males 30.3). Life expectancy increases to 
34.6 years (females 33.4, males 35.7) for individuals who reach one year of age, 
and to 40.4 years (females 39.2, males 41.5) for those who survive to adulthood. 
The oldest chimpanzee in Japan, a wild-born male, lived an estimated 68 years. 
One in six infants are stillborn, and nearly 80% of all infants born alive 
survive beyond their first birthday. Finally, we report that a seasonal death 
pattern exists and chimpanzees in Japan are more likely to decease in the winter 
months (Dec-Feb) than in any other season.

Neuroglia represent a diverse population of non-neuronal cells in the nervous 
systems, be that peripheral, central, enteric or autonomic nervous system. 
Arguably, these cells represent about half of the volume of the human brain. 
This volumetric ratio, and by extension glia to neurone ratio, not only widely 
differ depending on the size of the animal species brain and its positioning on 
the phylogenetic tree, but also vary between the regions of an individual brain. 
Neuroglia derived from a dual origin (ectoderm and mesodermal) and in an 
assorted morphology, yet their functional traits can be mainly classified into 
being keepers of homeostasis (water, ions, neurotransmitters, metabolites, 
fuels, etc.) and defenders (e.g., against microbial organisms, etc.) of the 
nervous system. As these capabilities go awry, neuroglia ultimately define their 
fundamental role in most, if not, all neuropathologies. This concept presented 
in this chapter serves as a general introduction into the world of neuroglia and 
subsequent topics covered by this book.

Nerve guide conduits (NGCs) with geometric design have shown significant 
advantages in guidance of nerve reinnervation across the defect of injured 
peripheral nerves. It is realized that intraluminal fillers with distinctive 
structure can effectively provide an inner guidance for sprouting of axons and 
improve the permeability of NGC. In this work, a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 
(PLGA) NGC is prepared containing intraluminal sponge fillers (labeled as 
ISF-NGC) and used for reconstruction of a rat sciatic nerve with a 10 mm gap. 
For comparison, the same procedure is applied to a single hollow PLGA NGC 
(labeled as H-NGC) and an autologous nerve. As evidenced by significantly 
improved nerve morphology and function, the ISF-NGC achieves a superior nerve 
repair effect over H-NGC, which is comparable to autologous nerve grafting. It 
is likely that the H-NGC only provides a protected tunnel for nerve fiber 
regrowth and axonal extension, while ISF-NGC offers an extracellular 
matrix-mimetic architecture as autograft to provide contact guidance for nerve 
reinnervation. This newly developed ISF-NGC is a promising candidate to aid 
nerve reinnervation across longer gaps commonly encountered in clinical cases.

Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder that has a significant impact 
on the patient's quality of life and functional health. Because the shoulder 
joint is a complex structure, the relevant symptoms of shoulder pain may not 
directly reflect the underlying pathology. Hence, several shoulder tests have 
been developed to examine shoulder problems, and their diagnostic accuracy 
varies. Familiarization with the performance of those physical tests and their 
strength and limitation are of utmost importance for physicians dealing with 
shoulder disorders. Therefore, the present narrative review focuses on 
summarizing the most commonly used tests in physical examination and their 
diagnostic performance on several shoulder pathologies. This article also 
discusses how ultrasound imaging can serve as an extension of those tests.

OBJECTIVES: Given the relative novelty of stereotactic body radiation therapy as 
a treatment modality low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, little data 
exist evaluating dosimetry and its impact on patient-reported quality of life 
(PR-QOL) metrics. Herein, we present an interim analysis of a phase II clinical 
trial of PR-QOL and dosimetric correlates.
METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate 
cancer, prostate volume ≤100 cm, and life expectancy ≥10 years were enrolled. 
Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores were tabulated by domain 
and evaluated in relation to dosimetry. Paired t test was performed to compare 
differences in scores from baseline. Minimally important differences were 
established using the anchor-based approach and correlations made using the χ 
test.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 18.1 
months (range, 3.0 to 76.9 mo). There were no cases of acute or late grade 3+ GI 
or GU toxicities. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores in urinary 
obstructive/irritative domain at 1 month (-4.8, P=0.03) and bowel domain at 1, 
6, and 12 months (-10.8, -6.1, and -5.2) were significantly different from 
pretreatment, with both returning to nonsignificant differences around 24 
months. Higher bladder V37Gy (≥3.35%) was associated with both late urinary 
incontinence and obstructive/irritative declines. Both higher rectal D5% and 
rectal V36Gy >0.6 cm were correlated with an enhanced proportion of patients 
with late minimally important difference declines.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher dose volumes for the bladder and rectum predicted for poorer 
PR-QOL. In contrast to prostate brachytherapy data, neither prostate volume nor 
urethral dosimetry at this dose schedule correlated with urinary symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: The use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator reduces the 
probability of sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-utility relationship of an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator compared to optimal pharmacological therapy for 
patients with ischemic or non-ischemic New York Heart Association class II or 
III (NYHA II-III) heart failure in Colombia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model including costs, 
effectiveness, and quality of life from the perspective of the Colombian health 
system. For the baseline case, we adopted a time horizon of 10 years and 
discount rates of 3% for costs and 3.5% for benefits. The transition 
probabilities were obtained from a systematic review of the literature. The 
outcome used was the quality-adjusted life years. We calculated the costs by 
consulting with the manufacturers of the device offered in the Colombian market 
and using national-level pricing manuals. We conducted probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was USD$ 13,187 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained. For a willingness-to-pay equivalent to three times the gross 
domestic product per capita as a reference (USD$ 19,139 in 2017), the device 
would be a cost-effective strategy for the Colombian health system. However, the 
result may change according to the time horizon, the probability of death, and 
the price of the device.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for preventing 
sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure would be a cost-effective 
strategy for Colombia. The results should be examined considering the 
uncertainty.

OBJECTIVES: Existing literature shows religion is associated with health and 
survival separately. We extend this literature by considering health and 
survival together using a multistate life table approach to estimate total, 
disability-free, and disabled life expectancy (LE), separately for women and 
men, for 2 disability measures, and by 2 indicators of religion.
METHOD: Data come from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2014 waves). 
Predictors include importance of religion and attendance at religious services. 
The disability measures are defined by ADLs and IADLs. Models control for 
sociodemographic and health covariates.
RESULTS: Attendance at religious services shows a strong and consistent 
association with life and health expectancy. Men and women who attend services 
at least once a week (compared with those who attend less frequently or never) 
have between 1.1 and 5.1 years longer total LE and between 1.0 and 4.3 years 
longer ADL disability-free LE. Findings for IADL disability are similar. 
Importance of religion is related to total and disabled LE (both ADL and IADL), 
but the differentials are smaller and less consistent. Controlling for 
sociodemographic and health factors does not explain these associations.
DISCUSSION: By estimating total, disability-free, and disabled LE, we are able 
to quantify the advantage of religion for health. Results are consistent with 
previous studies that have focused on health and mortality separately.

Racial disparities in the end-of-life treatment of patients are a well observed 
fact of the U.S. healthcare system. Less is known about how the physicians 
treating patients at the end-of-life influence the care received. Social 
networks have been widely used to study interactions with the healthcare system 
using physician patient-sharing networks. In this paper, we propose an extension 
of the dissimilarity index (DI), classically used to study geographic racial 
segregation, to study differences in patient care patterns in the healthcare 
system. Using the proposed measure, we quantify the unevenness of referrals 
(sharing) by physicians in a given region by their patients' race and how this 
relates to the treatments they receive at the end-of-life in a cohort of 
Medicare fee-for-service patients with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias. We apply the measure nationwide to physician patient-sharing 
networks, and in a sub-study comparing four regions with similar racial 
distribution, Washington, DC, Greenville, NC, Columbus, GA, and Meridian, MS. We 
show that among regions with similar racial distribution, a large dissimilarity 
index in a region (Washington, DC DI = 0.86 vs. Meridian, MS DI = 0.55), which 
corresponds to more distinct referral networks for black and white patients by 
the same physician, is correlated with black patients with Alzheimer's disease 
and related dementias receiving more aggressive care at the end-of-life 
(including ICU and ventilator use), and less aggressive quality care (early 
hospice care).

BACKGROUND: Despite excellent vaccine coverage, pertussis persists in Canada, 
with high incidence during recent outbreaks and non-negligible incidence in 
non-outbreak years. While Canadian pertussis incidence is well-characterized, 
the full health and economic impact of pertussis have not been examined in 
Canada. We estimated age-specific life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost, and costs due to pertussis in Ontario, Canada, using a 
model-based approach.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to simulate pertussis natural 
history. Daily probabilities of pertussis complications, hospitalizations, and 
disease sequelae as well as utilities and costs for health states were 
literature-derived. A healthcare payer perspective was used with a lifetime time 
horizon. Model outcomes were compared to those from a model with no pertussis 
health states. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to generate 
distributions for estimates. Economic burden was estimated by multiplying case 
cost estimates by annual age-specific incidence.
RESULTS: Overall, LYs lost per pertussis case was low, with negligible LYs lost 
in those aged >4 years. Infants (<6 months) had the greatest mean QALY loss per 
case (0.58), while adults lost only 0.05 QALYs per case. Infants experienced the 
greatest mean cost per case of $22,768 (95% CI: 21,144-23,406). Case costs 
generally declined with age, but increased in seniors (aged 65+) with mean cost 
of $1920 (95% CI: 1800-2033). Based on historic age-specific incidence, 
pertussis costs the Ontario healthcare system approximately $7.6-$21.5 M 
annually. In total economic cost estimates with QALYs valued at 1xGDP (3xGDP) 
per capita, the net impact of pertussis in Ontario was estimated at 
$21.7-$66.5 M annually ($50.0-$156.3 M). For all of Canada, total economic costs 
were estimated at $79.6-$241.3 M ($187.5-$580.5 M) annually.
CONCLUSION: The health and economic consequences of pertussis persistence are 
substantial and highlight the need for improved control strategies.

Aberrant RNA structure plays a central role in the molecular mechanisms guided 
by repeat RNAs in diseases like myotonic dystrophy (DM), C9orf72-linked 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome 
(FXTAS). Much knowledge remains to be gained about how these repeat-expanded 
transcripts are actually folded, especially regarding the properties specific to 
very long and interrupted repeats. RNA structure can be interrogated by chemical 
as well as enzymatic probes. These probes usually bind or cleave single-stranded 
nucleotides, which can subsequently be detected using reverse transcriptase 
primer extension. In this chapter, we describe methodology for in vitro 
synthesis and structure probing of expanded CUG repeat RNAs associated with DM 
type 1 and approaches for the associated data analysis.

PURPOSE: Evidence surrounding utilities for health states, derived either 
directly from the application of preference-based valuation methods or 
indirectly from the application of preference-based quality of life instruments, 
is increasingly being utilised to inform the cost-effectiveness of child health 
interventions. Proxy (parent or health professional) assessments are common in 
this area. This study sought to investigate the degree of convergence in 
childhood utilities generated directly or indirectly within dyad child and proxy 
assessments.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA 
guidelines. A comprehensive literature search strategy conducted across six 
search engines (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsychoINFO, EconLit, CINAHL and 
Cochrane Library). Original peer-reviewed articles that reported utilities 
derived directly or indirectly using simultaneous dyad child and proxy 
assessments were extracted. Mean and median utilities, correlation coefficients 
and levels of agreement were extracted, catalogued and assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies that reported utilities for two or more 
respondent types were identified. Of these, 29 studies reported dyad childhood 
self-report and proxy utilities whilst six studies reported levels of agreement 
and/or correlations only without documenting overall utilities. Proxy assessment 
was most often conducted by parents with the HUI3 representing the most commonly 
applied instrument across a range of health conditions. The utilities derived 
from child and parent proxy assessment were bidirectional with parental proxies 
tending to underestimate and health professional proxies tending to overestimate 
relative to child self-reports. Inter-rater agreement between child self-reports 
and parent-proxy reports were poorer for more subjective attributes (cognition, 
emotion and pain), relative to physical attributes (mobility, self-care, speech, 
vision) of health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood utilities derived from children or proxies are not 
interchangeable. The choice of self or proxy assessor may have potentially 
significant implications for economic evaluations of child health interventions.

There is continuous ageing in world population. Although life expectancy still 
increases there is no similar trend in maintaining quality of life. The number 
of disabilities due to age is expected to double in 2060. Muscle mass is one of 
the most important factors of health and nutrition in old age and it constant 
loss is characteristic for process of ageing. Muscle mass is controlled by 
number of different factors. The most important of which is balance between 
muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ageing has no influence on muscle 
protein degradation so for maintaining muscle mass it is better to target muscle 
protein synthesis. Optimal protein dose in the meal is the minimal amount of 
protein effecting in maximal anabolic response. Threshold for anabolic response 
increase with age. This process, named anabolic resistance can be overwhelmed 
with high amount of protein in diet. Experts in the field of ageing and 
nutrition recommend 1,2-1,5 g/kg/d protein for the maintaining of muscle mass, 
1,2-1,5 g/kg/d for older with additional risk factors, 2,0 g/kg/d for seriously 
ill and malnourished. Physical training has synergistic influence with diet 
protein. Physical training improves muscle performance, muscle strength and 
prevents muscle wasting. Physical training combined with increased amount of 
protein in diet results with increased muscle mass.

As UN research indicates, populations in approx. 40% of the world's countries 
presently meet the criteria of demographic old age. It is estimated that by 
2050, those criteria will have applied to 84% of them, out of which 65% will 
have entered an advanced stage. Data current for 2017 put the estimated number 
of seniors around the world at approx. 962 million, i.e. 13% of the world's 
population. Population ageing process has already reached its top dynamics in 
Poland. Both international studies, and our own research experience imply that 
only an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the seniors may help fully 
appreciate overall complexity of this challenge, and consequently offer an 
adequate platform for mapping out effective therapeutic management. Provision of 
a scope of wide-ranging, physiotherapeutic regimens for the seniors requires of 
any attending therapeutic team a specialist body of knowledge, pertinent 
expertise in geriatrics and physiotherapy, and plenty of hands-on skills. 
Physiotherapy in geriatrics is a complex, teamwork-based approach targeted at 
the seniors of appreciably reduced functional capabilities, and/or burdened with 
concomitant risk factors for a number of diseases, and/or prone to sustaining 
other adverse incidents (e.g. falls) typical for older age. In physiotherapeutic 
management offered to the seniors, as opposed to other age groups, by far the 
most essential issue consists in multiple concomitant diseases and polypragmacy. 
After a patient has been diagnosed by an attending physician, and his functional 
capabilities have been assessed by a physiotherapist, the therapeutic team 
should primarily focus upon securing for him the most essential goals, as 
identified at the time. Increased life expectancy raises a number of questions 
and challenges, to be urgently addressed by the medical sciences; the most basic 
and pragmatic question being - how are physicians, physiotherapists, and other 
health care professionals presently prepared to deal effectively with the 
seniors in terms of the actual treatment management, and a scope of 
physiotherapeutic interventions urgently required?

From the dawn of civilization, humanity has dreamed of immortality. So why 
didn't the discovery of the anti-aging properties of mTOR inhibitors change the 
world forever? I will discuss several reasons, including fear of the actual and 
fictional side effects of rapamycin, everolimus and other clinically-approved 
drugs, arguing that no real side effects preclude their use as anti-aging drugs 
today. Furthermore, the alternative to the reversible (and avoidable) side 
effects of rapamycin/everolimus are the irreversible (and inevitable) effects of 
aging: cancer, stroke, infarction, blindness and premature death. I will also 
discuss why it is more dangerous not to use anti-aging drugs than to use them 
and how rapamycin-based drug combinations have already been implemented for 
potential life extension in humans. If you read this article from the very 
beginning to its end, you may realize that the time is now.

Zea nicaraguensis is a wild relative of Zea mays subsp. mays (maize) that has 
high waterlogging tolerance. One of its traits is constitutive aerenchyma 
formation (CAF) in roots and this may be one of the reasons for the tolerance, 
but it has not yet been proven by comparing plants that differ only in CAF in 
the same genetic background. We therefore produced an introgression line 
AE24-50-44-91 (IL-AE91) possessing four quantitative trait loci for CAF from Z. 
nicaraguensis in the background of maize (inbred line Mi29). The degree of root 
CAF in IL-AE91 was intermediate between that of Mi29 and Z. nicaraguensis. 
Seedlings of IL-AE91 grown aerobically were more tolerant to transfer to 
oxygen-deficient conditions than were Mi29 seedlings. On day 2 of oxygen 
deficiency, the root extension rate and viability of root-tip cells in IL-AE91 
were ~2.7 and ~1.3 times greater, respectively, than they were in Mi29. On day 
4, the area of aerenchyma at 80 mm from the root tips was ~1.5 times greater in 
IL-AE91 and radial oxygen loss from the apical parts of roots was ~3.4 times
