BACKGROUND: Achieving health equity is a priority of the World Health 
Organization; however, there is a scant amount of literature on this topic. As 
the underlying influences that determine health loss caused by risk factors are 
age-dependent, the aim of this paper is to examine how the risk factor rankings 
for health loss differ by age.
METHODS: Rankings were based on data obtained from the 2010 Global Burden of 
Disease study. Health loss (as measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years lost) 
by risk factor was estimated using Population-Attributable Fractions, years of 
life lost due to premature mortality, and years lived with disability, which 
were calculated for 187 countries, 20 age groups and both sexes. Uncertainties 
of the risk factor rankings were estimated using 1,000 simulations taken from 
posterior distributions
RESULTS: The top risk factors by age were: household air pollution for neonates 
0-6 days of age [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1 to 1]; suboptimal breast 
feeding for children 7-27 days of age (95% UI: 1-1); childhood underweight for 
children 28 days to less than 1 year of age and 1-4 years of age (95% UI: 1-2 
and 1-1, respectively); iron deficiency for children and youth 5-14 years of age 
(95% UI: 1-1); alcohol use for people 15-49 years of age (95% UI: 1-2); and 
dietary risks for people 50 years of age and older (95% UI: 1-1). Rankings of 
risk factors varied by sex among the older age groups. Alcohol and smoking were 
the most important risk factors among men 15 years of age and older, and high 
body mass and intimate partner violence were some of the most important risk 
factors among women 15 years of age and older.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses confirm that the relative importance of risk factors 
is age-dependent. Therefore, preventing harms caused by various modifiable risk 
factors using interventions that target people of different ages should be a 
priority, especially since easily implemented and cost-effective public health 
interventions exist.

BACKGROUND: Opioid substitution treatment (OST) has been implemented in Taiwan 
since 2006. We estimated the life expectancy (LE) and expected years of life 
lost (EYLL) in a cohort of heroin users stratified by OST for comparison.
METHODS: A total of 1283 heroin users recruited from 2006 to 2008 were linked to 
the National Mortality Registry until the end of 2011. Among them, 983 received 
OST, while 300 did not. Kaplan-Meier estimation for survival was performed, and 
it was extrapolated to 50 years to obtain the LE using a semi-parametric method. 
We further estimated the EYLL for both cohorts by subtracting their life 
expectancies from the age- and sex-matched referents of the general population. 
Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and compared 
with the national cohort to validate the representativeness of this sample.
RESULTS: After extrapolation to 50 years of survival, the estimated average LE 
and EYLL were 27.4 and 10.6 for OST subjects, respectively, while those of the 
non-OST were 20.2 and 18.4 years. The all-cause mortality rates (per 1000 
person-years) in the observational period for the OST and non-OST group were 
15.5 and 23.9, respectively, representing a 7.5- and 10.2-fold SMR compared to 
the general population, indicating a high representativeness for our sample. But 
SMR of suicide mortality elevated 16.2 and 3.1 folds in OST and non-OST group, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: OST saves 7.8 EYLL more than non-OST after accounting for lead time 
bias. Effective suicide prevention programs could enhance its life-saving 
effect, especially among those co-morbid with depressive disorders.

BACKGROUND: Age-related loss of functional muscle mass is associated with 
reduced functional ability and life expectancy. In disseminated cancer, 
age-related muscle loss may be exacerbated by cachexia and poor nutritional 
intake, increasing functional decline, morbidity and accelerate death. Patients 
with spinal metastases frequently present for decompressive surgery with 
decision to operate based upon functional assessment. A subjective assessment of 
physical performance has, however, been shown to be a poor indicator of life 
expectancy in these patients. We aimed to develop an objective measure based 
upon lean muscle mass to aid decision making, in these individuals, by 
investigating the association between muscle mass and 1-year survival.
METHODS: Muscle mass was calculated as total psoas area (TPA)/ vertebral body 
area (VBA), by two independent blinded doctors from CT images, acquired within 7 
days of spinal metastases surgery, at the mid L3 vertebral level. Outcome at 1 
year following surgery was recorded from a prospectively updated metastatic 
spinal cord compression database.
RESULTS: 86 patients were followed for 1 year, with an overall mortality of 
39.5%. Mortality rates at 1 year were significantly high among patients in the 
lowest quartile of muscle mass, compared with those in the highest quartile 
(57.1 vs 23.8%, p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Death within 1 year in individuals with spinal metastases is related 
to lean muscle mass at presentation. Assessment of lean muscle mass may inform 
decision to operate in patients with spinal metastases.

A 2-day-old neonate was transferred to a specialist paediatric otolaryngology 
centre with stridor at rest, feeding difficulties and an apparent mass in the 
oropharynx. The newborn displayed evidence of respiratory distress, however, she 
remained self-ventilating. MRI highlighted a fat-containing lesion in the 
postnasal space with no intracranial extension. A CT scan under general 
anaesthesia showed no underlying bony abnormality, and hence an examination of 
the nasopharynx, oropharynx and microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were 
performed. The macroscopically hairy lesion arising from the superior aspect of 
the soft palate was resected. Histology displayed a benign growth measuring 
28×17×12 mm in keeping with a hairy polyp. This is one of very few cases, to the 
best of our knowledge, in which a hairy polyp (bigerminal choristomas) has 
resulted in stridor in the first few days of life. Nasal masses in neonates, 
although a rare phenomenon, remain clinically important as they are obligate 
nasal breathers.

OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of new oral disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
has not been modeled in highly active (HA) relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) requiring escalation therapy. This study sought to model the 
cost-effectiveness of fingolimod compared to dimethyl fumarate (DMF), for which 
relevant HA RRMS sub-group data were available, from the perspective of the 
National Health Service (NHS) in England.
METHODS: A cohort Markov model based on Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, 
similar to previous model designs, was constructed. Published post hoc clinical 
data in the HA RRMS sub-groups were taken from the pivotal trials for fingolimod 
and DMF vs placebo. Utility data for each health state and for relapses were 
used in line with previous similar models. Published costs were inflated to NHS 
cost year 2013-2014 and UK list prices used for both drugs. Possible Patient 
Access Scheme (PAS) discount scenarios were investigated.
RESULTS: In the base case, using list prices for each DMT, the average 
probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for fingolimod vs DMF 
was found to be £ 14,076, with a 73% chance of fingolimod being cost-effective 
at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 30,000. Scenario and sensitivity analyses 
showed that uncertainty in disability progression efficacy was a key model 
driver. The model was robust to other changes and the majority of PAS 
permutations do not contradict the base case finding of cost-effectiveness of 
fingolimod.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, fingolimod remains cost-effective in HA RRMS 
following the introduction of DMF to the UK market, and this paper supports the 
evidence that has led fingolimod to be the only oral DMT reimbursed for HA RRMS 
in England. This model supports the restriction imposed by National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on DMF in HA RRMS and highlights the 
importance of considering different sub-groups of multiple sclerosis when 
performing health economic analyses.

SETTING: Tobacco smoking is associated with significantly increased risks of 
latent tuberculous infection, active tuberculosis (TB), TB recurrence and 
mortality. Tobacco cessation interventions not only increase health benefits, 
they also reduce the risk of TB.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy 
(NRT) combined with TB screening strategies using interferon-gamma release 
assays (IGRAs; QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT] and T-SPOT(®).TB [T-SPOT]) 
and comparing these with the tuberculin skin test (TST) among TB contacts who 
smoke.
DESIGN: Decision trees and Markov models were constructed from a public health 
perspective. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 20-year-old 
contacts who smoke until the age of 70 years, with or without NRT. The main 
outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was compared.
RESULTS: QFT alone led to lower costs but fewer QALYs. TST alone and TST+NRT 
were absolutely dominated. IGRAs+NRT yielded greater benefits than IGRAs alone, 
and T-SPOT+NRT yielded the greatest benefits. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive 
to NRT effectiveness and rate of mortality reduction using NRT.
CONCLUSION: TB screening using an IGRA combined with NRT is more cost-effective 
among contacts who smoke. Positive smoking cessation interventions are 
recommended for their cost-effectiveness in low-incidence countries.

INTRODUCTION: Gypsies, Travellers and Roma (referred to here as Travellers) 
experience significantly poorer health and have shorter life expectancy than the 
general population. They are also less likely to access health services 
including immunisation. To improve immunisation rates, we need to understand 
what helps and hinders individuals in these communities in taking up 
immunisations. This study has two aims: (1) Investigate the barriers and 
facilitators to acceptability and uptake of immunisations among six Traveller 
communities in the UK; (2) Identify potential interventions to increase uptake 
in these Traveller communities.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A three-phase qualitative study with six Traveller 
communities. PHASE 1: In each community, we will explore up to 45 Travellers' 
views about the influences on their immunisation behaviours and ideas for 
improving uptake in their community. PHASE 2: In each community, we will 
investigate 6-8 service providers' perspectives on barriers and facilitators to 
childhood and adult immunisations for Traveller communities with whom they work, 
and ideas to improve uptake. Interview data will be analysed using the Framework 
approach. PHASE 3: The findings will be discussed and interventions prioritised 
in six workshops, each with 10-12 phase 1 and 3-4 phase 2 participants.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research received approval from NRES Committee 
Yorkshire and The Humber-Leeds East (Ref. 13/YH/02). It will produce (1) 
findings on the barriers and facilitators to uptake of immunisations in six 
Traveller communities; (2) a prioritised list of potentially feasible and 
acceptable interventions for increasing uptake in these communities; and (3) 
methodological development in undertaking research with diverse Traveller 
communities. The study has the potential to inform new ways of delivering 
services to ensure high immunisation uptake. Findings will be disseminated to 
participants, relevant UK organisations with responsibility for the 
implementation of immunisation policy and Traveller health/welfare; and 
submitted for publication in academic journals.

PURPOSE: In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) discouraged 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) -based prostate cancer screening. Previous 
USPSTF recommendations did not appreciably alter prostate cancer screening. 
Therefore, we designed a trend analysis to determine the population-based impact 
of the 2012 recommendation.
METHODS: The nationally representative National Health Interview Survey was used 
to estimate the proportion of men age 40 years and older who saw a physician and 
were screened for prostate cancer in 2013. An externally validated 9-year 
mortality index was used to analyze screening rates based on remaining life 
expectancy. Screening rates from 2005, 2010, and 2013 were compared using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: PSA-based screening did not significantly change from 2010 to 2013 
among 40- to 49-year-old men (from 12.5% to 11.2%; P = .4). Screening rates 
significantly declined in men age 50 to 59 years (from 33.2% to 24.8%; P < .01), 
age 60 to 74 years (from 51.2% to 43.6%; P < .01), and age 75 years or older 
(from 43.9% to 37.1%; P = .03). A large percentage of men were screened for 
prostate cancer despite a high risk (> 52%) of 9-year mortality, including 
approximately one third of men older than age 75 years. Approximately 1.4 
million men age 65 years or older with a high risk (> 52%) of 9-year mortality 
were screened in 2013.
CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer screening significantly declined among men older 
than age 50 years after the 2012 USPSTF guideline discouraging PSA-based 
screening. A significant proportion of men continue to be screened despite a 
high risk of 9-year mortality, including one third of men age 75 years and 
older.

Malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells are called carcinomas. Such 
cancers are diagnosed in about one in three humans in 'developed' countries, 
with the most common sites affected being lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary 
and pancreas. By contrast, carcinomas are said to be rare in captive 
chimpanzees, which share more than 99% protein sequence homology with humans 
(and possibly in other related 'great apes'-bonobos, gorillas and orangutans). 
Simple ascertainment bias is an unlikely explanation, as these nonhuman hominids 
are recipients of excellent veterinary care in research facilities and zoos, and 
are typically subjected to necropsies when they die. In keeping with this 
notion, benign tumours and cancers that are less common in humans are well 
documented in this population. In this brief overview, we discuss other possible 
explanations for the reported rarity of carcinomas in our closest evolutionary 
cousins, including inadequacy of numbers surveyed, differences in life 
expectancy, diet, genetic susceptibility, immune responses or their microbiomes, 
and other potential environmental factors. We conclude that while relative 
carcinoma risk is a likely difference between humans and chimpanzees (and 
possibly other 'great apes'), a more systematic survey of available data is 
required for validation of this claim.

OBJECTIVE: To identify whether Chinese current series of three 5 μg doses for 
newborn hepatitis B vaccination should be replaced by the series of three 10 μg 
doses.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal 
perspective based on the constructed decision tree-Markov model. Model 
parameters were estimated from published literatures, government documents and 
our surveys. The expected cost and effectiveness were compared between the 
3-dose 5 μg series (the 5 μg strategy) and the 3-dose 10 μg series (the 10 μg 
strategy), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, additional cost 
per quality-adjusted life-years gained) was calculated. Threshold values of the 
efficacy difference of the two series for the ICER=0, 1 and 3 times per capita 
gross domestic product were analyzed under different scenarios to understand 
whether the 10 μg strategy should replace the 5 μg strategy according to the 
recommendation of World Health Organization.
RESULTS: The 10 μg strategy would be cost-saving compared with the 5 μg strategy 
under the base-case scenario. Under keeping all the other parameters at the 
base-case values or further adjusting any one of them to the value most 
unfavorable to the 10 μg strategy, as long as the efficacy of 3-dose 10 μg 
series was slightly higher than that of 3-dose 5 μg series, the 10 μg strategy 
would be cost-effective, highly cost-effective, or even cost-saving. Even under 
the most pessimistic scenario, i.e. all the other parameters, but the discount 
rate, at the values most unfavorable to the 10 μg strategy, the 10 μg strategy 
would be cost-effective if the efficacy difference reached higher than 1.23 
percentage point.
CONCLUSION: For newborn hepatitis B vaccination in China, the 10 μg strategy 
should be cost-effective, even more possibly highly cost-effective or 
cost-saving compared with the current 5 μg strategy. The doses of 10 μg should 
be considered to replace the doses of 5 μg in newborn hepatitis B vaccination in 
China.

Pain is a subjective phenomenon, not fully understood, which is manifesting 
abnormally in most of the disorders. Also, in the case of schizophrenia, a 
psychiatric disorder marked by gross distortion from reality, disturbances in 
thinking, feeling and behavior, pain behaves in an unpredictable manner, just 
like the evolution of this mental disorder. In this way, findings on this matter 
are contradictory, some pleading for decreased pain perception in schizophrenia, 
others for increased pain sensitivity, while there are also reports stating no 
differences between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients. Still, it is 
now generally accepted that pain perception is impaired in various ways in 
schizophrenics. Nevertheless, pain is a very important clinical issue in this 
population that needs to be clarified. Throughout this paper, we are going to 
review these contradictory information regarding pain manifestations in the 
context of schizophrenia in both human patients and animal models, emphasizing 
the importance of determining pain mechanism, its particularities and evolution 
in the context of schizophrenic disease, so that this phenomenon could be 
evaluated, quantified and controlled with the intention of obtaining a superior 
management for this disorder and to possibly raise hopes of higher life quality 
and expectancy in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Also, we would like to 
raise awareness on this matter, making psychiatrists, general practitioners, and 
other medical specialists more conscious of the importance of this problem, so 
that medical care could improve for these patients in the future.

BACKGROUND: The Turkish government has implemented several reforms to improve 
the Turkish Statistical Institute Death Reporting System (TURKSTAT-DRS) since 
2009. However, there has been no assessment to evaluate the impact of these 
reforms on causes of death statistics. This study attempted to analyse the 
impact of these reforms on the TURKSTAT-DRS for Turkey, and in the case of 
Izmir, one of the most developed provinces in Turkey.
METHODS: The evaluation framework comprised three main components each with 
specific criteria. Firstly, data from TURKSTAT for Turkey and Izmir for the 
periods 2001-2008 and 2009-2013 were assessed in terms of the following 
dimensions that represent quality of mortality statistics (a. completeness of 
death registration, b. trends in proportions of deaths with ill-defined causes). 
Secondly, the quality of information recorded on individual death certificates 
from Izmir in 2010 was analysed for a. missing information, b. timeliness of 
death notifications and c. characteristics of deaths with ill-defined causes. 
Finally, TURKSTAT data were analysed to estimate life tables and summary 
mortality indicators for Turkey and Izmir, as well as the leading 
causes-of-death in Turkey in 2013.
RESULTS: Registration of adult deaths in Izmir as well as at the national level 
for Turkey has considerably improved since the introduction of reforms in 2009, 
along with marked decline in the proportions of deaths assigned ill-defined 
causes. Death certificates from Izmir indicated significant gaps in recorded 
information for demographic as well as epidemiological variables, particularly 
for infant deaths, and in the detailed recording of causes of death. Life 
expectancy at birth estimated from local data is 3-4 years higher than similar 
estimates for Turkey from international studies, and this requires further 
investigation and confirmation.
CONCLUSION: The TURKSTAT-DRS is now an improved source of mortality and cause of 
death statistics for Turkey. The reliability and validity of TURKSTAT data needs 
to be established through a detailed research program to evaluate completeness 
of death registration and validity of registered causes of death. Similar 
evaluation and data analysis of mortality indicators is required at regular 
intervals at national and sub-national level, to increase confidence in their 
utility as primary data for epidemiology and health policy.

BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is characterised by mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, 
resulting in Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. Treatment with selumetinib 
(AZD6244, ARRY-142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor, results in antitumour effects in 
uveal melanoma pre-clinical models. A randomised phase II trial demonstrated 
improved progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR) with selumetinib 
monotherapy versus chemotherapy with temozolomide or dacarbazine in patients 
with metastatic uveal melanoma. Pre-clinically, selumetinib in combination with 
alkylating agents enhanced antitumour activity compared with chemotherapy alone. 
We hypothesise that selumetinib in combination with dacarbazine will result in 
improved clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma versus 
dacarbazine alone.
METHODS/DESIGN: SUMIT is a randomised, international, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of 
selumetinib in combination with dacarbazine in patients with metastatic uveal 
melanoma who have not received prior systemic therapy. Primary endpoint is PFS. 
Secondary endpoints include objective RR, duration of response, change in tumour 
size at Week 6, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Exploratory endpoints 
include efficacy in tumours with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. Eligible patients must 
have: ≥1 lesion that can be accurately measured at baseline, and is suitable for 
accurate repeated measurements; ECOG performance status 0-1; life expectancy>12 
weeks. Mutation status for GNAQ/GNA11 will be assessed retrospectively. An 
estimated 128 patients from approximately 50 sites globally will be randomised 
(3:1) to selumetinib 75 mg twice daily or placebo in combination with 
dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle until objective disease 
progression, intolerable toxicity or occurrence of another discontinuation 
criterion. Randomisation will be stratified by the presence/absence of liver 
metastases. Tumours will be evaluated by RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks. All patients 
have the option of receiving selumetinib with or without dacarbazine at disease 
progression. Study enrolment began in April 2014 and is expected to complete in 
early 2015.
DISCUSSION: Treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma represents an 
area of high unmet medical need. This study evaluating selumetinib in 
combination with dacarbazine was designed with input from the US FDA, and is the 
first potential registration trial to be conducted in patients with metastatic 
uveal melanoma.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive deterioration of 
brain function, with a consequent significant decline in the quality of life of 
patients and their families. Due to the concurrent increase in life expectancy, 
the incidence of these diseases has been increasing over the last years and thus 
there is a growing interest in finding potential risk factors. This review 
focuses on the correlation between peripheral inflammatory diseases and 
neurodegeneration, in particular on the relationship between gastrointestinal 
disorders and Parkinson&#39;s disease, especially through the so called 
gut-brain axis.

Modelling the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for early, rapidly 
progressing rheumatoid arthritis by simulating the reversible and irreversible 
effects of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab plus methotrexate 
(MTX) versus MTX monotherapy in early, aggressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when 
explicitly modelling short-term (reversible) and long-term (irreversible, ie, 
joint damage) disease activity and physical function.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to unify, in a single 
cost-effectiveness model, measures of reversible and irreversible disease 
activity and physical function based on data from the PREMIER trial. Short term, 
reversible disease activity was modelled using DAS28 variables, including 
swollen joint counts, tender joint counts, C reactive protein concentration and 
pain. The DAS28 variables were then used in a logistic regression to predict 
short-term American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses, which informed 
treatment continuation and switches. Long term, irreversible, radiographically 
documented joint damage was modelled using modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS). 
The model then linked both short-term disease activity and mTSS to the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire score, which was used to calculate direct and indirect 
costs, and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: When both reversible and irreversible effects of therapy were included, 
combination therapy was estimated to produce 6-month 50% ACR responses in 75% of 
patients versus 54% in MTX monotherapy. Compared to MTX monotherapy, combination 
therapy resulted in 2.68 and 3.04 discounted life years and QALYs gained, 
respectively. Combination therapy also resulted in a net increase in direct 
costs of £106,207 for a resulting incremental cost/QALY gain of £32,425. When 
indirect costs were included in the analysis, the ICER (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio) decreased to £27,238. Disregarding irreversible 
effects increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to £78,809 (when only 
direct costs were included).
CONCLUSIONS: Starting with adalimumab plus MTX combination therapy in early, 
aggressive RA is cost-effective when irreversible damage is adequately 
considered.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease, are among the most debilitating neurological disorders, and as life 
expectancy rises quickly around the world, the scientific and clinical 
challenges of dealing with them will also increase dramatically, putting 
increased pressure on the biomedical community to come up with innovative 
solutions for the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions. 
Despite several decades of intensive research, there is still little that can be 
done to prevent, cure, or even slow down the progression of NDs in most 
patients. There is an urgent need to develop new lines of basic and applied 
research that can be quickly translated into clinical application. One way to do 
this is to apply the tools of proteomics to well-characterized samples of human 
brain tissue, but a closer partnership must still be forged between proteomic 
scientists, brain banks, and clinicians to explore the maximum potential of this 
approach. Here, we analyze the challenges and potential benefits of using human 
brain tissue for proteomics research toward NDs.

Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA, pganz@mednet.ucla.edu.

Although women less than 50 years old make up less than 25% of the patient 
population with breast cancer in industrialized countries, they have unique 
clinical and psychosocial issues that must be addressed as part of their 
oncology care to ensure the best health and psychosocial outcomes after 
treatment. Preserving fertility is a major issue for many younger women who have 
either not had children or would like to have additional children after 
treatment. Dealing with the disruption of a cancer diagnosis at a young age is 
challenging physically, socially and emotionally, and the health care system 
does not always address these patients' concerns. Because younger women have the 
potential for a long life expectancy after cancer treatment, preventing and 
reducing the risk for late effects of cancer treatment is very important. We 
discuss these and a range of other issues throughout this chapter.

BACKGROUND: This study is concerned with understanding the impact of demographic 
changes, socioeconomic inequalities, and the availability of health factors on 
life expectancy (LE) in the low and lower middle income countries.
METHODS: The cross-country data were collected from 91 countries from the United 
Nations agencies in 2012. LE is the response variable with demographics (total 
fertility rate, and adolescent fertility rate), socioeconomic status (mean year 
of schooling, and gross national income per capita), and health factors 
(physician density, and HIV prevalence rate) are as the three main predictors. 
Stepwise multiple regression analysis is used to extract the main factors.
RESULTS: The necessity of more healthcare resources and higher levels of 
socioeconomic advantages are more likely to increase LE. On the other hand, 
demographic changes and health factors are more likely to increase LE by way of 
de-cease fertility rates and disease prevalence.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that international efforts should aim at 
increasing LE, especially in the low income countries through the elimination of 
HIV prevalence, adolescent fertility, and illiteracy.

The scope of the National Comprehensive Health Policy for the Black Population 
is to ensure equitable health care to this population. This policy is to 
compensate for the discrimination suffered by this ethnic group throughout the 
history of Brazil. The black population presents higher social and economic 
vulnerability, leading to shorter life expectancy and an increased 
susceptibility to diseases. The objective of the study is to investigate the 
black population's knowledge about this policy, its potential benefits and the 
difficulties of this population regarding access to health. It involves 
cross-sectional, quantitative and descriptive research. Structured interviews 
were conducted with 391 black people in Juiz de Fora. The sample was structured 
according to race (black and brown). Around 90% of the sample reported not 
knowing the existence of a health policy for the black population, and 53% 
stated that this policy could enhance racial discrimination. Having completed 
primary education and lower income was positively associated with higher 
discrimination in health care. Most of the sample didn't know the existence of 
the PNSIPN, but was in favor of its goals, despite the possibility that it can 
reinforce the legacy of Brazilian racial discrimination.

BACKGROUND: Increasing volumes of data and computational capacity afford 
unprecedented opportunities to scale up infectious disease (ID) mapping for 
public health uses. Whilst a large number of IDs show global spatial variation, 
comprehensive knowledge of these geographic patterns is poor. Here we use an 
objective method to prioritise mapping efforts to begin to address the large 
deficit in global disease maps currently available.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Automation of ID mapping requires bespoke 
methodological adjustments tailored to the epidemiological characteristics of 
different types of diseases. Diseases were therefore grouped into 33 clusters 
based upon taxonomic divisions and shared epidemiological characteristics. 
Disability-adjusted life years, derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 
study, were used as a globally consistent metric of disease burden. A review of 
global health stakeholders, existing literature and national health priorities 
was undertaken to assess relative interest in the diseases. The clusters were 
ranked by combining both metrics, which identified 44 diseases of main concern 
within 15 principle clusters. Whilst malaria, HIV and tuberculosis were the 
highest priority due to their considerable burden, the high priority clusters 
were dominated by neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne parasites.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A quantitative, easily-updated and flexible framework 
for prioritising diseases is presented here. The study identifies a possible 
future strategy for those diseases where significant knowledge gaps remain, as 
well as recognising those where global mapping programs have already made 
significant progress. For many conditions, potential shared epidemiological 
information has yet to be exploited.

Selection of prosthetic valve and evidence--need for the development of Japan's 
own guidelines.

Sezai A(1), Shiono M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Nihon University School of Medicine, 
Tokyo, Japan.

PURPOSE: In 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of 
Cardiology (ACC) guidelines were largely revised with regard to the selection of 
prosthetic valves. (1) A mechanical prosthesis is reasonable for aortic valve 
replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) in patients less than 60 
years of age, (2) A bioprosthesis is reasonable in patients more than 70 years 
of age, and (3) Either a bioprosthetic or mechanical valve is reasonable in 
patients between 60 and 70 years of age.Japan faces the unprecedented population 
aging, and moreover, the average life expectancy is longer among the Japanese 
than the Westerners. In Japan, whether this choice is appropriate seems 
questionable.
METHODS: This time, with the revision of the AHA/ACC guidelines, it might be 
necessary to take into consideration the average life expectancy of Japanese 
people and revise the Japanese guidelines accordingly.
RESULTS: We should consider whether 60-70 years should be set as a gray zone
