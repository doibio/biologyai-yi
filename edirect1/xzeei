PURPOSE: To understand the natural history and clinical outcomes for patients 
with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in the United States utilizing the United 
States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) patient registry.
METHODS: The USIDNET registry was queried for data from XLA patients collected 
from 1981 to 2019. Data fields included demographics, clinical features before 
and after diagnosis of XLA, family history, genetic mutation in Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK), laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and mortality.
RESULTS: Data compiled through the USIDNET registry on 240 patients were 
analyzed. Patient year of birth ranged from 1945 to 2017. Living status was 
available for 178 patients; 158/178 (88.8%) were alive. Race was reported for 
204 patients as follows: White, 148 (72.5%); Black/African American, 23 (11.2%); 
Hispanic, 20 (9.8%); Asian or Pacific Islander, 6 (2.9%), and other or more than 
one race, 7 (3.4%). The median age at last entry, age at disease onset, age at 
diagnosis, and length of time with XLA diagnosis was 15 [range 
(r) = 1-52 years], 0.8 [r = birth-22.3 years], 2 [r = birth-29 years], and 10 
[r = 1-56 years] years respectively. One hundred and forty-one patients (58.7%) 
were < 18 years of age. Two hundred and twenty-one (92%) patients were receiving 
IgG replacement (IgGR), 58 (24%) were on prophylactic antibiotics, and 19 (7.9%) 
were on immunomodulatory drugs. Eighty-six (35.9%) patients had undergone 
surgical procedures, two had undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation, and 
two required liver transplantation. The respiratory tract was the most affected 
organ system (51.2% of patients) followed by gastrointestinal (40%), 
neurological (35.4%), and musculoskeletal (28.3%). Infections were common both 
before and after diagnosis, despite IgGR therapy. Bacteremia/sepsis and 
meningitis were reported more frequently before XLA diagnosis while encephalitis 
was more commonly reported after diagnosis. Twenty patients had died (11.2%). 
The median age of death was 21 years (range = 3-56.7 years). Neurologic 
condition was the most common underlying co-morbidity for those XLA patients who 
died.
CONCLUSIONS: Current therapies for XLA patients reduce early mortality, but 
patients continue to experience complications that impact organ function. With 
improved life expectancy, more efforts will be required to improve 
post-diagnosis organ dysfunction and quality of life. Neurologic manifestations 
are an important co-morbidity associated with mortality and not yet clearly 
fully understood.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Our national guidelines regarding screening and 
surveillance for colorectal cancer recommend individualized discussions with 
patients 75-85 years of age. This review explores the complex decision-making 
that surrounds these discussions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite updated guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and 
surveillance, the guidance for patients 75 years of age or older remains 
unchanged. Studies exploring the risks to colonoscopy in this population, 
patient preferences, life expectancy calculators and additional studies in the 
subpopulation of inflammatory bowel disease patients provide points of 
consideration to aid in individualized discussions. The benefit-risk discussion 
for colorectal cancer screening in patients over 75 years old warrants further 
guidance to develop best practice. To craft more comprehensive recommendations, 
additional research with inclusion of such patients is needed.

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a main host for the adult life 
stages of tick species of medical and veterinary importance. Since white-tailed 
deer play a vital role in tick ecology, research has been conducted to 
understand this tick-host relationship. To date, research involving captive 
white-tailed deer and artificial infestation of these animals with ticks has 
focused on host suitability, the role of white-tailed deer in tick-borne 
diseases, and anti-tick vaccine research. The methodology reported for these 
studies was at times not descriptive and inconsistent regarding how and what 
region of the white-tailed deer was infested with ticks. Here, we propose a 
standardized method to artificially infest captive white-tailed deer with ticks 
for research purposes. The protocol describes a method proven effective to 
experimentally infest captive white-tailed deer with blacklegged ticks (Ixodes 
scapularis) to study tick-host interactions. The methods can be reliably 
transferred for experimental infestation of white-tailed deer by other 
multi-host and one-host tick species.

BACKGROUND: Suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STBs) are significant public 
health challenges that affect a variety of individuals and communities. Despite 
numerous efforts to discover and refine psychotherapy treatments to minimize 
STBs, the efficacy of STB treatments remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Conduct a scoping review to assess the efficacy of using 
psychotherapy treatments to minimize STBs among individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
METHOD: A scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines 
(PRISMA-ScR) to screen 163 studies published between 2010 and 2021.
RESULTS: A total of seven articles that fulfil the eligibility criteria reported 
that psychotherapy treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder were found to be 
effective and applicable approaches to minimize the severity of the OCD symptoms 
and STBs, despite variance in studies' target samples, types of interventions, 
periods and indicators.
CONCLUSION: The current review has provided evidence showing the significant 
effects of psychotherapy treatments on various health-related aspects of life 
for individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it is 
recommended to use them for enhancing treatment outcomes and minimizing STBs.
IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: This scoping review verifies the formalization and 
incorporation of psychotherapy treatments for OCD to minimize STBs into standard 
practice and highlights the importance of mental health professionals being part 
of the implementation of these treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Ageing is accompanied by an age-related decrease in mobility or 
cognitive and sensory functions; in addition, physiological changes in the skin 
occur with age. Therefore, the skin requires appropriate care and observation in 
order to prevent or manage a variety of dermatological diseases and conditions, 
and to prevent or minimise effects on the quality of life.Globally, most older 
people live at home, and the need to establish sustainable structures and 
processes to support and to care for people at home for as long as possible has 
been emphasised. The body of evidence supporting screening, diagnosis and 
management of skin conditions in older people living at home has not been 
collated and summarised to date. The aim of this scoping review is to describe 
and summarise the extent and nature of the available body of evidence in this 
regard.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. 
Eligibility criteria were developed using the Population, Concept and Context 
framework, and the search will focus on systematic and scoping reviews as well 
as clinical practice guidelines. Two reviewers will conduct systematic searches, 
screen and select identified evidence as well as extract and chart data, 
independently. Finally, data will be systematically analysed and summarised 
descriptively to map existing evidence and identify gaps.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of research, not involving humans or 
unpublished secondary data, approval of an ethics committee is not required. The 
dissemination of findings is planned via professional networks and publication 
in scientific open access journals.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and healthy life 
expectancy loss, ranking first in causing the global burden of disease. In 
addition to the traditional CVD risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, 
environmental chemical pollutants may also play a role in the development of 
CVD. This paper summarizes the evidence regarding the relation of exposures to 
metal or metalloid and persistent organic pollutants with risk for CVD and 
introduces the research progress in the relation between the exposures to two 
environmental chemical pollutants and CVD risk. The study aims to provide 
scientific evidence for the effective prevention of CVD through the management 
of chemical pollutants in environment.

OBJECTIVE: To report the global, regional, and national estimates of knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) burden and associated risk factors (high body mass index 
[BMI]) by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI) for 204 countries from 1990 
to 2019.
METHODS: We analyzed the prevalence, incidence, years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and age-standardized rates of knee OA using data from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019. Estimates of the knee OA 
burden were derived from data modeled using a Bayesian meta-regression 
analytical tool (DisMod-MR 2.1).
RESULTS: The global prevalence of knee OA in 2019 was ~364.6 million (95% 
uncertainty interval [95% UI] 315.3 to 417.4). The age-standardized prevalence 
in 2019 was 4,376.0 per 100,000 (95% UI 3,793.0 to 5,004.9), an increase of 7.5% 
between 1990 and 2019. There were ~29.5 million incident cases of knee OA in 
2019 (95% UI 25.6 to 33.7), with an age-standardized incidence of 350.3 per 
100,000 (95% UI 303.4 to 398.9). The global age-standardized YLD resulting from 
knee OA was 138.2 (95% UI 68.5 to 281.3) per 100,000 population in 2019, an 
increase of 7.8% (95% UI 7.1 to 8.4) from 1990. Globally in 2019, 22.4% (95% UI 
12.1 to 34.2) of YLD resulting from knee OA was attributable to high BMI, an 
increase of 40.5% since 1990.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence, incidence, YLDs, and age-standardized rates of knee 
OA increased substantially in most countries and regions from 1990 to 2019. 
Continuous monitoring of this burden is important for establishing appropriate 
public prevention policies and raising public awareness, especially in high- and 
high-middle SDI regions.

A Mediterranean-style diet (MED) can promote people lengthen the span of life 
and avoid atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in primary prevention. 
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) can significantly reduce life expectancy and increase 
the risk of ASCVD. However, few studies have focused on the role of the 
Mediterranean diet in patients with MetS. Participants in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with MetS (N = 8301) from 2007 to 2018 
were examined. A 9-point evaluation scorewas used to measure the degree of 
adherence to the MED diet. In order to compare the various levels of adherence 
to the MED diet and the effects of the specific MED diet components on all-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality, Cox regression models were utilized. Among the 
8301 participants with MetS, about 13.0% (1080 of 8301) died after a median 
follow-up of 6.3 years. In this study, participants with MetS with adherence to 
high-quality and moderate-quality Mediterranean diet were significantly 
associated with lower all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular mortality 
during the follow-up period. Futhermore, in joint analysis of the Mediterranean 
diet and sedentary behavior or depression, we found that high-quality or 
moderate-quality Mediterranean diet could attenuate, even reverse the adverse 
effects of sedentary behavior and depression on all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality in participants with MetS. Among the components of the MED diet, 
greater intakes of vegetables, legumes, nuts and high MUFA/SFA ratio were 
significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality and greater vegetables 
intake was significantly associated with lower cardiovascular mortality, while 
more red/processed meat intake was significantly associated with higher 
cardiovascular mortality in participants with MetS.

BACKGROUND: There were limited studies on the quantification of the modifiable 
and nonmodifiable lung cancer burden over time in China. Furthermore, the 
potential effect of risk factor reduction for lung cancer on gains in life 
expectancy (LE) remains unknown.
METHODS: This study explored temporal trends in lung cancer deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) attributable to modifiable risk factors 
from 1990 to 2019, based on the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. The 
abridged period life table method was used to quantify the effect of risk 
factors on LE. The authors used the decomposition approach to estimate 
contributions of aging metrics to change in the lung cancer burden.
RESULTS: Nationally, the majority of lung cancer deaths and DALYs were 
attributable to behavioral and environmental risk clusters. Potential gains in 
life expectancy (PGLE) at birth would be 0.78 years for males and 0.35 years for 
females if the exposure to risk factors was mitigated to the theoretical minimum 
level. Tobacco use had the most robust impact on LE for both sexes (PGLE: 
0.71 years for males and 0.19 years for females). From 1990 to 2019, 
risk-attributable age-standardized death and DALY rates of lung cancer showed an 
increasing trend in both sexes; adult population growth imposed 245.9 thousand 
deaths and 6.2 million DALYs for lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The modifiable risk-attributable lung cancer burden remains high in 
China. Effective tobacco control is the critical step toward addressing the lung 
cancer burden. Adult population growth was the foremost driver of transition in 
the age-related lung cancer burden.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: We estimate the lung cancer burden attributable to 
modifiable and nonmodifiable contributors and the effect of risk factor 
reduction for lung cancer on the life expectancy in China. The findings suggest 
that the majority of lung cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life years were 
attributable to behavioral risk clusters, and the risk-attributable lung cancer 
burden increased nationally from 1990 to 2019. The average gains in life 
expectancy would be 0.78 years for males and 0.35 years for females if the 
exposure to risk factors for lung cancer was reduced to the theoretical minimum 
risk exposure level. Adult population growth was identified as the foremost 
driver of variation in the aging lung cancer burden.

AIM: Estimating the burden of obesity in five European countries (Germany, 
Greece, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) and the potential health benefits and 
changes in health care costs associated with a reduction in body mass index 
(BMI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the long-term burden 
of obesity. Health states were based on the occurrence of diabetes, ischaemic 
heart disease and stroke. Multiple registries and literature sources were used 
to derive the demographic, epidemiological and cost input parameters. For the 
base-case analyses, the model was run for a starting cohort of healthy obese 
people with a BMI of 30 and 35 kg/m2 aged 40 years to estimate the lifetime 
impact of obesity and the impact of a one-unit decrease in BMI. Different 
scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The base-case analyses showed that total lifetime health care costs 
(for obese people aged 40 and BMI 35 kg/m2 ) ranged from €75 376 in Greece to 
€343 354 in the Netherlands, with life expectancies ranging from 37.9 years in 
Germany to 39.7 years in Spain. A one-unit decrease in BMI showed gains in life 
expectancy ranging from 0.65 to 0.68 year and changes in total health care costs 
varying from -€1563 to +€4832.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of obesity is substantial in the five 
countries. Decreasing BMI results in health gains, reductions in obesity-related 
health care costs, but an increase in non-obesity related health care costs, 
which emphasizes the relevance of including all costs in decision making on 
implementation of preventive interventions.

BACKGROUND: Although the adiponectin signalling exerts exercise-mimicking 
effects, whether this pathway contributes to the anti-ageing benefits of 
physical exercise has not been established yet.
METHODS: Swim exercise training and wheel running were used to measure lifespan 
in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and skeletal muscle quality in mice, 
respectively. Muscle weight, muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and 
myonuclei number were used to evaluate muscle mass. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) 
analysis of skeletal muscle in exercised mice was used to study the underlying 
mechanisms. Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed to explore 
autophagy- and senescence-related markers.
RESULTS: The C. elegans adiponectin receptor PAQR-1/AdipoR1, but not 
PAQR-2/AdipoR2, was activated (3.55-fold and 3.48-fold increases in p-AMPK on 
Days 1 and 6, respectively, P < 0.001), which was involved in lifespan extension 
in exercised worms. Exercise training increased skeletal muscle mass index 
(1.29-fold, P < 0.01), muscle weight (1.75-fold, P < 0.001), myonuclei number 
(1.33-fold, P < 0.05), muscle fibre CSA (1.39-fold, P < 0.05) and capillary 
abundance (2.19-fold, P < 0.001 for capillary density; 1.58-fold, P < 0.01 for 
capillary number) in aged mice. Physical exercise reduced protein (2.94-fold, 
P < 0.001) and mRNA levels (1.70-fold, P < 0.001) of p16INK4a , a marker for 
cellular senescence, in skeletal muscle of aged mice. These beneficial effects 
of exercise on skeletal muscle of mice were dependent on AdipoR1. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis for differentially expressed 
genes in skeletal muscle between exercised mice with and without AdipoR1 
knockdown by RNA-Seq analysis revealed that several KEGG pathways, such as 'AMPK 
signalling pathway' (P < 0.001), 'FOXO signalling pathway' (P < 0.001) and 
'autophagy' (P < 0.001) were overrepresented. Knockdown of FoxO3a inhibited 
exercise-mediated beneficial effects on skeletal muscle quality of mice by 
inhibiting autophagy/mitophagy (3.81-fold reduction in LC3-II protein, 
P < 0.001; 1.53-fold reduction in BNIP3 protein, P < 0.05). Knockdown of daf-16, 
the FoxO homologue in C. elegans, reduced autophagy (2.77-fold and 2.06-fold 
reduction in GFP::LGG-1 puncta in seam cells and the intestine, respectively, 
P < 0.05) and blocked lifespan extension by exercise in worms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into how the AdipoR1 pathway has an 
impact on the anti-ageing benefits of exercise and implicate that activation of 
the AdipoR1 signalling may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for 
reducing age-related loss of skeletal muscle.

BACKGROUND: Hispanic people with cystic fibrosis (CF) have decreased life 
expectancy and earlier acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to 
non-Hispanic white individuals with CF. Racial and ethnic differences in the 
airway microbiome of CF may contribute to known health disparity, but have not 
been studied. The objective was to describe differences in the upper airway 
microbial community in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children with CF.
METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study of 59 Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic white children with CF, ages 2-10 years old, was performed at Texas 
Children's Hospital (TCH) from February 2019 to January 2020. Oropharyngeal 
swabs were collected from the cohort during clinic visit. Swab samples underwent 
sequencing (16S V4 rRNA), diversity analysis, and taxonomic profiling. Key 
demographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record 
and the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR). Statistical analysis compared 
sequencing, demographic, and clinical data.
RESULTS: We found no significant difference in Shannon diversity or relative 
abundance of bacterial phyla between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children with CF. 
However, a low abundant taxa- "uncultured bacterium" belonging to the order 
Saccharimonadales was significantly higher in Hispanic children (mean relative 
abundance = 0.13%) compared to the non-Hispanic children (0.03%). Hispanic 
children had increased incidence of P. aeruginosa (p = 0.045) compared to 
non-Hispanic children.
CONCLUSION: We did not find a significant difference in the airway microbial 
diversity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children with CF. However, we 
found a greater relative abundance of Saccharimonadales and higher incidence of 
P. aeruginosa in Hispanic children with CF.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report long-term results of infrarenal 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a single tertiary Hospital.
METHODS: One thousand seven hundred seventy-seven consecutive AAA repairs 
(2003-2018) were included. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, 
AAA-related mortality, reinterventions rate. Open repair (OSR) was offered in 
case the patient had a functional capacity ≥4 metabolic equivalents (MET), and a 
predicted >10 year life expectancy. Endovascular repair (EVAR) was offered in 
case of hostile abdomen, presence of anatomic feasibility for standard 
endovascular graft, and <4 MET. Sac shrinkage was defined as a reduction of both 
anterior-posterior and latero-lateral diameter of the sac of at least 5 mm at 
the last follow-up vs. the first post- operative follow-up imaging.
RESULTS: Eight hundred twenty-eight (47%) OSRs and 949 (53%) EVARs were 
performed 90.6% (N.=1610) were male, mean age was 73.8 years. Mean follow-up was 
79 (SD: 51) months. 30-day mortality was 0.7% (N.=6) and 0.6% (N.=6) for OSR and 
EVAR respectively (P=1). Long-term survival was better for OSR as expected by 
the selection criteria used (P<0.001), while AAA-related death was similar in 
the OSR vs. EVAR group (P=0.37); 664 (70%) sac shrinkages occurred at the last 
follow-up in the EVAR group. Freedom from reintervention was 97% and 96% at 1 
year, 96.5% and 88.4% at 5 years, 95.8% vs. 81.7% at 10 years, and 94.6% 
vs.72.3% at 15 years for OSR and EVAR, respectively (P<0.001). The 
reintervention rate was significantly lower in the sac shrinkage vs. no-sac 
shrinkage subgroup and but higher than the OSR (P≤0.001). Any statistical 
difference was found for the survival outcome in case of sac shrinkage (P=0.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Open repair of an infrarenal AAA had a lower reintervention rate 
than EVAR even in case of a shrinked sac at a long-term follow-up. Further 
studies with greater sample size are needed.

Over the last 21 years, the paradigm has shifted from an initial use of TAVI for 
inoperable aortic stenosis cases to recognition of its benefits for all 
categories of patients. Since 2021, the European Society of Cardiology has 
recommended first-line transfemoral TAVI from the age of 75 for all categories 
of patients with aortic stenosis (high, intermediate, low risk). However, in 
Switzerland, the Federal Office of Public Health currently places a restriction 
on the reimbursement of low-risk patients, which is expected to be reassessed in 
2023. Surgery remains the best therapeutic option for patients with an 
unfavorable anatomy and for those whose life expectancy exceeds the potential 
durability of the valve. In this article we will discuss the evidence supporting 
TAVI, its current indications and initial complications as well as areas for 
improvement to potentially further expand its indications.

Publisher: Au cours des deux dernières décennies, le paradigme est passé d’une 
utilisation initiale du TAVI pour les cas de sténose aortique inopérables à une 
reconnaissance de ses bénéfices pour toutes les catégories de patients. Depuis 
2021, la Société européenne de cardiologie recommande le TAVI transfémoral en 
première intention dès 75 ans pour toutes les catégories de patients avec 
sténose aortique (risque élevé, intermédiaire, bas). En Suisse, l’Office fédéral 
de la santé publique impose une restriction pour le remboursement des patients à 
bas risque, avec une réévaluation prévue durant l’année 2023. Cependant, la 
chirurgie garde une place particulière pour les patients avec une anatomie 
défavorable et pour ceux dont l’espérance de vie dépasse la durabilité 
potentielle de la valve. Dans cet article, nous discutons des preuves, des 
indications actuelles, des complications initiales du TAVI et des points à 
améliorer pour potentiellement étendre davantage les indications.

We aimed to calculate disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALE) for Korean 
older adults based on their sex, educational attainment, and residential region 
across their cognitive status. We included 3,854 participants (aged 65-91 years) 
from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging's seventh survey data. The 
participant's cognitive function status (normal, moderately impaired, or 
severely impaired) was determined based on cognitive examination and physical 
function independence, which was used to calculate their DALE. Females with 
normal cognition had higher DALE (7.60 years, Standard Deviation (SD) = 3.88) 
than males (6.76, SD = 3.40); however, both sexes had comparable DALE for 
cognitive impairment. In contrast, the DALE values increased with higher 
educational achievements. Regarding residential areas, the DALE value for 
participants with normal cognition and moderate impairment was the highest among 
urban dwellers, while DALE for participants with severely impaired cognitive 
function was highest among rural dwellers; however, there were no statistically 
significant differences based on residential conditions. Our findings suggest 
that demographic characteristics should be considered when developing health 
policies and treatment strategies to meet the needs of the aging population in 
Korea.

With increasing life expectancy, a growing number of individuals are being 
affected by Parkinson's Disease (PD), a Neurodegenerative Disease (ND). 
Approximately, 5-10% of PD is explained by genetic causes linked to known PD 
genes. With improvements in genetic testing and high-throughput technologies, 
more PD-associated susceptibility genes have been reported in recent years. 
However, a comprehensive review of the pathogenic mechanisms and physiological 
roles of these genes is still lacking. This article reviews novel genes with 
putative or confirmed pathogenic mutations in PD reported since 2019, summarizes 
the physiological functions and potential associations with PD. Newly reported 
PD-related genes include ANK2, DNAH1, STAB1, NOTCH2NLC, UQCRC1, ATP10B, TFG, 
CHMP1A, GIPC1, KIF21B, KIF24, SLC25A39, SPTBN1 and TOMM22. However, the evidence 
for pathogenic effects of many of these genes is inconclusive. A variety of 
novel PD-associated genes have been identified through clinical cases of PD 
patients and analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, more 
evidence is needed in confirm the strong association of novel genes with 
disease.

Global, regional and national burden of endocrine, metabolic, blood and immune 
disorders 1990-2019: a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease study 
2019.

ZheJiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine, metabolic, blood and immune disorders (EMBID) is a vital 
public health problem globally, but the study on its burden and global trends 
was scarce. We aimed to evaluate the global burden of disease and trends in 
EMBID from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We extracted the data of EMBID-related on death cases, Age-standardized 
death rates (ASDRs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), Age-standardized 
DALY rates, years of life lost (YLLs), Age-standardized YLL rates, years lived 
with disability (YLDs) and Age-standardized YLD rates between 1990 and 2019 from 
the Global Burden of Disease 2019, by sex, age, and year at the global and 
geographical region levels. The Annual rate of change was directly extracted 
from Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and we also calculated the age-related 
age-standardized rate (ASR) to quantify trends in EMBID-related deaths, DALYs, 
YLLs and YLDs.
RESULT: Globally, the EMBID-related ASDRs showed an increasing trend, whereas 
the DALYs ASR, YLLs ASR and YLDs ASR were decreased between 1990 to 2019. 
Furthermore, High-income North America and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa had the 
highest both ASDRs and DALYs ASR, and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa and Caribbean 
had the highest both YLDs ASR and YLLs ASR in 2019. Males had a higher 
EMBID-related ASDRs than females, but the DALYs ASR in females were higher than 
males. The burden of EMBID was higher in older-aged compared to other age 
groups, especially in developed regions.
CONCLUSION: Although EMBID-related ASRs for DALYs-, YLLs- and YLDs declined at 
the global level from 1990 to 2019, but the ASDRs was increasing. This implied 
high healthcare costs and more burden of ASDRs due to EMBID in the future. 
Therefore, there was an urgent need to adopt geographic targets, age-specific 
targets, prevention strategies and treatments for EMBID to reduce negative 
health outcomes globally.

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Colorectal Surgery.

Cleveland, Ohio.

Given the increased life expectancy and improvements in the treatment of 
colorectal patients, the success of a treatment course can no longer be 
determined only by objective outcomes. Health care providers ought to take into 
consideration the impact an intervention will have on the quality of life of 
patients. Endpoints that take into account the patient's perspective are defined 
as patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs are assessed through patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs), usually in the form of questionnaires. PROs are 
especially important in colorectal surgery, whose procedures can often be 
associated with some degree of postoperative functional impairment. Several 
PROMs are available for colorectal surgery patients. However, while some 
scientific societies have offered recommendations, there is no standardization 
in the field and PROMs are seldom implemented in clinical practice. The routine 
use of validated PROMs can guarantee that functional outcomes are followed over 
time; this way, they can be addressed in case of worsening. This review will 
provide an overview of the most commonly used PROMs in colorectal surgery, both 
generic and disease specific, as well as a summary of the available evidence in 
support of their routine utilization.

This paper studies the dynamic effects of longevity on intergenerational 
policies and fertility, distinguishing between effects of expected and 
unexpected longevity gains. Old agents become poorer from unexpected longevity 
gains than from expected gains, as they cannot prepare (save) for the former in 
advance. In an overlapping-generations model with means-tested pay-as-you-go 
social security, we show that young agents reduce their fertility when longevity 
increases because they need to save more for their old age ("life-cycle 
effect"), and in the unexpected case, they also need to pay taxes to support the 
impoverished elderly ("policy effect"). Using cross-country panel data on 
mortality rates and social expenditure, we find that an unexpected increase in 
life expectancy at age 65 lowers total fertility rate growth and government 
family-related spending growth while raising government old-age spending growth.

Mortality analysis studies in Cabo Verde are scarce and those available are 
limited to short periods of analysis and to specific population groups. National 
mortality data reports do not quantify the burden of disease associated with 
premature mortality. This study estimated the years of potential life lost 
(YPLL), years of potential productive life lost (YPPLL) and the costs associated 
with them in Cabo Verde from 2016 to 2020 and aimed to determine trends of early 
mortality due to all causes of death. Mortality data were obtained from the 
Ministry of Health, Cabo Verde. Deaths that occurred from 2016 to 2020, in 
individuals aged between one (1) and 73 years old were analyzed by sex, age 
group, municipality and cause of death. YPLL, YPPLL and cost of productivity 
lost (CPL) were estimated using life expectancy and the human capital approach 
methods, respectively. There were 6100 deaths recorded in the sample population 
and males represented 68.1% (n = 4,154) of the reported deaths. The number of 
deaths verified corresponded to 145,544 YPLL, of which 69.0% (n = 100,389) were 
attributed to males. There were 4,634 deaths among individuals of working age, 
which resulted in 80 965 YPPLL, with males contributing 72.1% (n = 58,403) of 
the total YPPLL. The estimated CPL due to premature death was 98,659,153.23 USD. 
Injuries and external causes together accounted for 21,580,954.42 USD (21.9%) of 
CPL, while diseases of the circulatory system 18,843,260.42 USD (19.1%) and 
certain infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 16,633,842.70 USD 
(16.9%). The study demonstrated the social and economic burden of premature 
mortality. The YPLL, YPPLL and CPL measures can be used to complement measures 
traditionally used to demonstrate the burden and loss of productivity due to 
premature mortality and to support resource allocation and public health 
decision making in Cabo Verde.

Plain Language Summary: The term “presbystasis” refers to a common clinical 
condition in the elderly, characterised by a multifactorial and progressive 
impairment of balance. The pathophysiology may be related to various concomitant 
factors including central nervous system diseases, peripheral neuropathy, 
osteoarticular disorders (leading to a reduction of the speed gait), and 
cardiovascular or visual disorders, but it may also be a consequence of deficits 
of the peripheral or central vestibular system (which is generally represented 
by a bilateral and symmetric vestibular dysfunction). Benign paroxysmal 
positional vertigo (BPPV) is far from being rare in subjects over the age of 70 
years. Nowadays, presbystasis represents one of the main causes of accidental 
falls in the elderly, leading to a reduction in quality of life and life 
expectancy. The aim of our work was to review the current literature on
