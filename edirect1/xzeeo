once weekly alendronate 70 mg orally or placebo for a total duration of 12 
months. BMD and VFA were re-evaluated at 12 months. Markers of bone resorption 
(C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen; CTX) and bone formation 
(Procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide; P1NP), and pain scores were measured 
at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was the change of BMD. 
The secondary endpoints were changes in bone turnover markers (BTM) and pain 
scores.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients received the study drug, 28 patients were 
assigned to receive alendronate and 23 patients to receive placebo. At 12 
months, patients in the alendronate group had significant improvement of BMD at 
L1-L4 compared to their baseline (0.72 ± 0.11 vs 0.69 ± 0.11 g/cm2, p = 0.004), 
while there was no change in the placebo group (0.69 ± 0.09 vs 0.70 ± 0.06 
g/cm2, p = 0.814). There was no significant change of BMD at femoral neck in 
both groups. Serum BTMs were significantly decreased among patients receiving 
alendronate at 6 and 12 months. The mean back pain score was significantly 
reduced compared to the baseline in both groups (p = 0.003). Side effects were 
rarely found and led to a discontinuation of the study drug in 1 patient (grade 
3 fatigue).
CONCLUSION: Alendronate 70 mg orally once weekly for 12 months effectively 
improves BMD at L-spine, reduces serum BTMs, and alleviates back pain in 
thalassemia patients with osteoporosis. The treatment was well tolerated and had 
a good safety profile.

AIMS: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant tumor with a strong invasive nature 
and low survival rate. We aimed to estimate the PC burden at the global, 
regional, and national levels in 204 countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Detailed data, including the incidence, death, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), were analyzed from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 530,297 (486,175-573,635) incident cases and 
531,107 (491,948-566,537) deaths from PC in 2019. The age-standardized incidence 
rate (ASIR) was 6.6 (6-7.1), and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) was 
6.6 (6.1-7.1) per 100,000 person-years. PC caused 11,549,016 
(10,777,405-12,338,912) DALYs, with an age-standardized rate of 139.6 
(130.2-149.1) per 100,000 person-years. There were increases in estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) of ASIR (0.83; 0.78-0.87), ASMR (0.77; 0.73-0.81), 
and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) (0.67; 0.63-0.71). The global number of 
incident cases increased by 168.7%, from 197,348 (188,604-203,971) to 530,297 
(486,175-573,635); the number of deaths increased by 168.2% from 198,051 
(189,329-204,763) to 531,107 (491,948-566,537); and total DALYs increased by 
148.5% from 4,647,207 (4,465,440-4,812,129) to 11,549,016 
(10,777,405-12,338,912). East Asia and China recorded the highest number of 
incident cases, deaths, and DALYs. The proportion of deaths was attributable to 
smoking (21.4%), elevated fasting glucose (9.1%), and high BMI (6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study updated the epidemiological trends and risk factors for 
PC. PC remains a major hazard to the sustainability of health systems worldwide, 
with an increasing incidence rate and mortality from 1990 to 2019. More targeted 
strategies are required to prevent and treat PC.

Venous, Arterial, and Neuropathic Leg Ulcers With Emphasis on the Geriatric 
Population.

Leg ulcers are a common and often serious problem in older adults. Underlying 
conditions that increase risk include age-related increases in chronic venous 
insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, connective tissue and autoimmune 
conditions, reduced mobility, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Geriatric patients 
have a higher risk of multiple wound-related complications including infection, 
cellulitis, ischemia, and gangrene, any of which may lead to further 
complications including amputation. The very presence of these lower extremity 
ulcers in the elderly negatively impacts their quality of life and ability to 
function. Understanding and early identification of the underlying conditions 
and wound features are important for effective ulcer healing and complication 
mitigation. This targeted review focuses on the three most common types of lower 
extremity ulcers: venous, arterial, and neuropathic. The goal of this paper is 
to characterize and discuss the general and specific aspects of these lower 
extremity ulcers and their relevancy and impact on the geriatric population. The 
top five main results of this study can be summarized as follows. (1) Venous 
ulcers, caused by inflammatory processes secondary to venous reflux and 
hypertension, are the most common chronic leg ulcer in the geriatric population. 
(2) Arterial-ischemic ulcers are mainly due to lower extremity vascular disease, 
which itself tends to increase with increasing age setting the stage for an 
age-related increase in leg ulcers. (3) Persons with DM are at increased risk of 
developing foot ulcers mainly due to neuropathy and localized ischemia, both of 
which tend to increase with advancing age. (4) In geriatric patients with leg 
ulcers, it is important to rule out vasculitis or malignancy as causes. (5) 
Treatment is best made on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's 
underlying condition, comorbidities, overall health status, and life expectancy.

A Comparison of the Mortality Experience of U.S. Adults Estimated With the 
2006-2018 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files and the Annual 
U.S. Life Tables.

Keralis JM, Zhang C, Cox CS, Mirel LB.

Objective-Linking data is a powerful mechanism to provide policy-relevant 
information. The National Center for Health Statistics' Data Linkage Program 
produces linked mortality files (LMFs) for research by linking data from the 
National Center for Health Statistics' surveys, including the National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS), to mortality data from the National Death Index. 
Assessing the accuracy of the linked data is an important step in ensuring its 
analytic use. This report compares the cumulative survival probabilities 
estimated with the 2006-2018 NHIS LMFs to those from the annual U.S. life 
tables.

Incidence and mortality are default measures to describe cancer trends. 
Mortality compounds incidence and survival but not age at death. We calculated 
years of life lost (YLL) due to 1 of the 10 solid tumors causing most deaths 
(lung, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, breast, hepatobiliary, urinary, central 
nervous system, gastric, melanoma) using Swedish National Cancer and Cause of 
Death Registers. Comparing YLL with mortality in 2019, lung (43 152 YLL) and 
colorectal (32 340 YLL) cancer remained at the top, pancreatic cancer was 
upranked fourth to third (22 592 YLL) and breast cancer fifth to fourth (21 810 
YLL), while prostate cancer was downranked third to fifth (17 380 YLL). 
Assessing YLL over 2010-2019, women lost consistently more life years because of 
lung and pancreatic cancer. A downward colorectal cancer mortality trend was 
reflected as a YLL decline only in women. YLL is simple to calculate, is 
intuitive to interpret, and expands the understanding of the cancer burden on 
society.

It is of great interest to probe glycosylation in primary neuron cultures. 
However, per-O-acetylated clickable unnatural sugars, which have been routinely 
utilized in metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) for analyzing glycans, showed 
cytotoxicity to cultured primary neurons and thus led to the speculation that 
MGL was not compatible with primary neuron cell cultures. Here, we uncovered 
that neuron cytotoxicity of per-O-acetylated unnatural sugars was related to 
their reactions with protein cysteines via non-enzymatic S-glyco-modification. 
The modified proteins were enriched in biological functions related to 
microtubule cytoskeleton organization, positive regulation of axon extension, 
neuron projection development, and axonogenesis. We thus established MGL in 
cultured primary neurons without cytotoxicity using S-glyco-modification-free 
unnatural sugars including ManNAz, 1,3-Pr2ManNAz, and 1,6-Pr2ManNAz, which 
allowed for visualization of cell-surface sialylated glycans, probing the 
dynamics of sialylation, and large-scale identification of sialylated N-linked 
glycoproteins and the modification sites in primary neurons. Particularly, a 
total of 505 sialylated N-glycosylation sites distributed on 345 glycoproteins 
were identified by 1,6-Pr2ManNAz.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the trends in the disease burden of schistosomiasis 
worldwide and in China, and Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2019, so as to provide 
insights into the formulation of the schistosomiasis control strategy in 
Zimbabwe.
METHODS: Based on Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) data sources, 
the age-standardized prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
rate of schistosomiasis were compared in the world, China, and Zimbabwe and the 
trends in the disease burden of schistosomiasis from 1990 to 2019 were 
investigated using Joinpoint regression analysis. In addition, the associations 
between the burden of schistosomiasis worldwide and in China and Zimbabwe from 
1990 to 2019 and socio-demographic index (SDI) were examined using Pearson 
correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence, mortality, and DALY rate of 
schistosomiasis were 1 804.95/105, 0.14/105 and 20.92/105 in the world, 
707.09/105, 0.02/105 and 5.06/105 in China, and 2 218.90/105, 2.39/105 and 
90.09/105 in Zimbabwe in 2019, respectively. The global prevalence, mortality, 
and DALY rate of schistosomiasis appeared a tendency towards a rise followed by 
a decline with age in 2019, while the prevalence and DALY rate of 
schistosomiasis appeared a tendency towards a sharp rise followed by a 
fluctuating decline in both China and Zimbabwe, and the mortality of 
schistosomiasis appeared a tendency towards a rise. The age-standardized 
prevalence [average annual percent change (AAPC) = -1.31%, -2.22% and -6.12%; t 
= -20.07, -83.38 and -53.06; all P values < 0.05)] and DALY rate of 
schistosomiasis (AAPC = -1.91%,-4.17% and -2.08%; t = -31.89, -138.70 and 
-16.45; all P values < 0.05) appeared a tendency towards a decline in the world, 
China and Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2019, and the age-standardized mortality of 
schistosomiasis appeared a tendency towards a decline in the world and China 
(AAPC = -3.46% and -8.10%, t = -41.03 and -61.74; both P values < 0.05), and 
towards a rise followed by a decline in Zimbabwe (AAPC = 1.35%, t = 4.88, P < 
0.05). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that the 
age-standardized prevalence (r = -0.75, P < 0.05), mortality (r = -0.73, P < 
0.05), and DALY rate of schistosomiasis (r = -0.77, P < 0.05) correlated 
negatively with SDI in the world, China and Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of schistosomiasis appeared a remarkable decline 
in China from 1990 to 2019, and the prevalence of schistosomiasis showed a 
tendency towards a decline in Zimbabwe from 1990 to 2019; however, the mortality 
and DALY rate of schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe topped in the world. A 
schistosomiasis control strategy with adaptations to local epidemiology and 
control needs of schistosomiasis is needed to facilitate the elimination of 
schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe.

BACKGROUND: Estimated life expectancy for older patients with diabetes informs 
decisions about treatment goals, cancer screening, long-term and advanced care, 
and inclusion in clinical trials. Easily implementable, evidence-based, 
diabetes-specific approaches for identifying patients with limited life 
expectancy are needed.
OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate an electronic health record (EHR)-based tool to 
identify older adults with diabetes who have limited life expectancy.
DESIGN: Predictive modeling based on survival analysis using Cox-Gompertz models 
in a retrospective cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes aged ≥ 65 years from Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California: a 2015 cohort (N = 121,396) with follow-up through 
12/31/2019, randomly split into training (N = 97,085) and test (N = 24,311) 
sets. Validation was conducted in the test set and two temporally distinct 
cohorts: a 2010 cohort (n = 89,563; 10-year follow-up through 2019) and a 2019 
cohort (n = 152,357; 2-year follow-up through 2020).
MAIN MEASURES: Demographics, diagnoses, utilization and procedures, medications, 
behaviors and vital signs; mortality.
KEY RESULTS: In the training set (mean age 75 years; 49% women; 48% racial and 
ethnic minorities), 23% died during 5 years follow-up. A mortality prediction 
model was developed using 94 candidate variables, distilled into a life 
expectancy model with 11 input variables, and transformed into a risk-scoring 
tool, the Life Expectancy Estimator for Older Adults with Diabetes (LEAD). LEAD 
discriminated well in the test set (C-statistic = 0.78), 2010 cohort 
(C-statistic = 0.74), and 2019 cohort (C-statistic = 0.81); comparisons of 
observed and predicted survival curves indicated good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: LEAD estimates life expectancy in older adults with diabetes based 
on only 11 patient characteristics widely available in most EHRs and claims 
data. LEAD is simple and has potential application for shared decision-making, 
clinical trial inclusion, and resource allocation.

This study was designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables 
through a novel technique based on utilization of microbially driven enzyme 
glucose oxidase and casting a fine layer of hydrogen peroxide on the food item 
that protected the fruit from decay. The produced nanoparticles (ZnO, Ag) were 
ligated with Glucose Oxidize (GOx) purified from Aspergillus niger. Post 
ligation studies revealed that ligated enzymes display relatively enhanced 
activity. Four types of sprays were prepared in order to compare their 
effectiveness. Glucose oxidase/silver nanoparticles (GOx/AgNPs), glucose 
oxidase/zinc oxide nanoparticles (GOx/ZnONPs), AgNPs and ZnONPs sprays were 
applied to guava fruit samples as post-harvest therapeutic agents for a period 
of 15 days. Fruit quality parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS), pH, 
weight loss, DPPH free radical capturing performance and firmness confirms that 
usage of the bioconjugates especially that of GOx/ZnONP was curiously active to 
maintain the physical appearance of fruit well along with no such deterioration 
in chemical composition of fruit. Consequently, enzymes ligated on the surface 
of nanoparticles (ZnONP) are exceptional for extension of post-harvest shelf 
life of fruits such as guava.

The new coagulation factors have made possible to increase the life expectancy 
of patients with hemophilia to around 70 years of age. However, there are some 
comorbidities to take into account such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular 
or metabolic diseases. Improving dietary habits and promoting physical exercise 
are the two ways of preventing this. But, less than 50% of people with 
haemophilia actually do something in this sense, even though to practice 
physical activity or sport is save if you under treatment.

Hemophilia, a congenital coagulopathy characterized by a deficiency in 
coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B), results in a 
tendency of bleeding proportional to the lacking factor. Most bleeds in patients 
with hemophilia occur in their joints and muscles, and because of these bleeding 
episodes, patients may end up developing musculoskeletal alterations resulting 
from hemophilic arthropathy, even receiving hemostatic treatment. The third 
edition of the World Federation of Hemophilia's Guidelines for the Management of 
Hemophilia defines 12 principles that encompass all the different types of 
multidisciplinary care required by people with hemophilia, one of these being 
clinical and epidemiological research. The expected number of patients with 
hemophilia across the world has been estimated at 1125 000, most of them 
undiagnosed, and the total number of patients with severe hemophilia at 418 000 
males. Data available from medium and high-income countries show that the 
prevalence at birth (incidence) and the prevalence of hemophilia differ, which 
means that patients with hemophilia are at a disadvantage in terms of life 
expectancy as compared with the general population. In medium-to-high-income 
countries, the life expectancy disadvantage of patients with hemophilia A and B 
as compared with the rest of the population is 30% and 24%, respectively. This 
life expectancy disadvantage is much greater in countries with more limited 
access to treatments for hemophilia.

BACKGROUND: The survival rate of adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 
depends on the responses to standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or combined 
therapy. Resource-limited countries face numerous obstacles in supporting 
patients with HL who undergo chemotherapy, especially in advanced stages.
AIM: To analyze the survival outcomes of adult patients with HL after 
combined-modality treatment (CMT) with involved-field or non-involved-field 
radiotherapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 90 adult 
patients with HL who received CMT at Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok between 2007 
and 2021. Patients with stage I-IV disease received different therapies 
depending on their risk group. The risk groups were evaluated according to 
initial response, bulky disease, and B symptoms. Patients (n = 90) who underwent 
CMT were followed up for 34.7 months (range, 1-141 months). The median follow-up 
periods of early and advanced-stage patients were 53.1 months and 23.5 months, 
respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS) rates of patients with advanced-stage diseases were 85% and 62%, 
respectively. There was a difference in the 3-year overall survival among 
advance-stage patients who underwent ABVD (94%) compared to those administered 
BEACOPPesc (50%), and the 3-year PFS (84%) among patients who underwent ABVD was 
higher than that among those administered BEACOPPesc (66%). Radiotherapy 
increased toxicity but did not improve the survival rate.
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy administered to patients with advanced-stage adult HL 
was more effective than BEACOPPesc when ABVD was administered. Our findings are 
relevant for hospitals with limited resources.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 8-week of coenzyme Q10 
(CoQ10) supplementation alone or combined with concurrent training (CT) on 
functional capacity, serum brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve 
growth factor (NGF) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Our hypothesis is that 
CT promotes improvements in the studied outcomes with higher results for the 
combination of CT and CoQ10. Randomized placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-eight 
patients with MS were randomly divided into 4 groups: CT+placebo, CT+CoQ10, 
CoQ10 and placebo. CT involved two resistance training sessions and one aerobic 
training session per week. CoQ10 was supplemented with 200 mg daily. Serum 
levels of BDNF, NGF and functional tests [timed up and go (TUG), 6-min walk 
(6MW), chest press, lateral pull down, leg extension, and lying leg curls one 
repetition maximum] were measured before and after the intervention period. 
CT+placebo and CT+CoQ10 significantly improved performance in TUG, 6MW, chest 
press, lateral pull down, leg extension, and lying leg curls, with superior 
results to both CoQ10 and placebo groups. Changes in TUG for CT+placebo were 
significantly higher than CT+CoQ10 (p<0.05). There were no significant 
differences in NGF and BDNF among the four groups (p >0.05). CT improves 
physical abilities in patient with MS, regardless CoQ10 supplementation. CT 
should be recommended for MS patients to increase functional capacity, but there 
seems to be no benefit in supplementing CoQ10.

Conflict of interest statement: We confirm that we have read the Journal’s 
position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report 
is consistent with those guidelines. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common 
debilitating neurological disease among adults. MS is an autoimmune central 
nervous system disorder characterised by demyelination and neurodegeneration 
that leads to physical disability. Previous researches examined nutritional 
strategies that are potentially effective for MS management., Given the 
important role of inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction 
in MS development, treatments with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant supplements 
have received growing attention., Among them, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is considered 
a promising therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative diseases. The administration 
of CoQ10 alone or in combination with other substances in mice with 
induced-neurodegenerative disease provided neuroprotective effects such as 
decreased brain oxidative stress and damage, as well as increased neurotrophic 
factors (e.g., BDNF)., CoQ10 supplementation might be of potential interest due 
to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in MS patients, as well as its 
positive effects on fatigue and depressive symptoms. Physical exercise is also a 
potential therapeutic strategy for managing MS, and is considered safe and 
effective, with positive effects in fitness, functional capacity and quality of 
life. Exercise exerts its positive therapeutic effects through different 
pathways. It increases regeneration of sensory neurons after axonal injury, 
stimulates the expression of genes associated with axon growth and regeneration, 
and improves nerve function., Physical exercise can also reduce MS symptoms by 
improving motor coordination, aerobic capacity and muscle strength. Moreover, 
physical exercise has been shown to increase the expression of neurotrophic 
factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor 
(NGF)., Although many different strategies have been used, the combination of 
resistance and aerobic training, known as concurrent training (CT), has been 
shown to be particularly beneficial for people with MS., Considering the 
potential benefits of CoQ10 supplementation in MS, it is plausible to suggest 
that it might exert additional effects when combined with CT. Therefore, the aim 
of the present study was to investigate the effects of eight weeks of a CT and 
CoQ10 supplementation on physical function, serum BDNF and NGF levels in people 
with MS. Our hypothesis is that CT would promote improvements in the studied 
outcomes with higher results for the combination of CT and CoQ10.

COVID-19 has had a powerful impact on society with high rates of morbidity and 
mortality. The use of an epidemiological indicator that estimates the burden of 
a disease by aggregating early mortality and non-fatal cases in a single measure 
has the potential to assist in the planning of more appropriate actions at 
different levels of health care. The scope of this article is to estimate the 
burden of disease due to COVID-19 in Florianópolis/SC from April 2020 through 
March 2021. An ecological study was carried out with data from notification and 
deaths by COVID-19 in the period of 12 months. The burden indicator called 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) was used, obtained by adding the Years of 
Life Lost (YLL) to the Years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD). A 
total of 78,907 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Of these, 763 died 
during the period under study. Overall, 4,496.9 DALYs were estimated, namely a 
rate of 883.8 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants. In males, there were 2,693.1 DALYs, 
a rate of 1,098.0 DALYs per 100,000 males. In women, there were 1,803.8 DALYs, a 
rate of 684.4 DALYs per100,000 women. The age group most affected in both sexes 
was 60 to 69 years. The burden of COVID-19 was high in the city studied. The 
highest rates were in females and in the 60-69 age group.

Perdidos (YLL) com os Anos Vividos com Incapacidade (YLD). Foram incluídos 
78.907 casos de COVID-19 confirmados. Desses, 763 evoluíram a óbito no período 
estudado. No total, foram estimados 4.496,6 DALYs, taxa de 883,8 DALYs/100.000 
habitantes. No sexo masculino, foram 2.693,1 DALYs, taxa de 1.098,0 
DALYs/100.000 homens. Em mulheres, foram 1.803,8 DALYs, taxa de 684,4 
DALYs/100.000 mulheres. A faixa etária mais acometida em ambos os sexos foi de 
60 a 69 anos. Foi alta a carga de COVID-19 na cidade estudada. As maiores taxas 
foram encontradas no sexo feminino e na faixa-etária de 60-69 anos.

Cancer is a significant burden worldwide that adversely impacts life expectancy, 
quality of life, health care costs, and workforce productivity. Although 
currently recommended screening tests for individual cancers reduce mortality, 
they detect only a minority of all cancers and sacrifice specificity for high 
sensitivity, resulting in a high cumulative rate of false positives. Blood-based 
multicancer early detection tests (MCED) based on next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) and other technologies hold promise for broadening the number of cancer 
types detected in screened populations and hope for reducing cancer mortality. 
The promise of this new technology to improve cancer detection rates and make 
screening more efficient at the population level demands the development of 
novel trial designs that accelerate clinical adoption. Carefully designed 
clinical trials are needed to address these issues.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Arg16Gly ADRB2 pharmacogenomic 
testing compared with no Arg16Gly ADRB2 testing to guide the use of long-acting 
β2 receptor agonist (LABA) in asthma patients aged 1 to 5 years in China.
METHODS: This economic evaluation developed a Markov model with four health 
states (no exacerbation, mild exacerbation, moderate-to-severe exacerbation, and 
death). Transition probabilities were estimated from the rate of exacerbations, 
the case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized for exacerbations, and natural 
mortality. Costs included drug costs and exacerbation management costs. Cost 
inputs and utilities for each health state were gained from public databases and 
the literatures. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated 
for ten years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, in contrast to the group without the 
genotype test, the incremental total cost was -¥334.7, and the incremental QALY 
was 0.001 in the Arg16Gly ADRB2 genotyping group. Therefore, the Arg16Gly ADRB2 
test group was the dominant strategy for children with asthma in China. The 
sensitivity analyses showed that the model was relatively stable.
CONCLUSION: Arg16Gly ADRB2 testing before using LABA is a cost-effective 
approach compared with no gene testing for pediatric asthma.

Magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia as a new cancer treatment technology 
has been applied for some kinds of tumors. To review the different applications 
and effectiveness of this new cancer treatment technique, PubMed, Science 
Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were explored up to 
November 2022, using the following keywords combined in different ways: 
"Magnetic Nanoparticles Based Hyperthermia", "Magnetic Nanoparticles" AND 
"Hyperthermia" AND "Cancer". The obtained results were screened for the title 
and abstract and the relevant papers were reviewed for further details. Finally, 
24 papers were included in the study. These papers have evaluated the 
application of magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia for treating different 
cancers including breast, liver, prostate, pancreas, colon, brain, lung, and 
stem cell. Various nanoparticles including Iron Oxide (Fe2O3, Fe3O4), Dextran 
Spermine, Iron Chloride, Magnetic nanoparticles conjugated with Liposomes 
(MCLs), and Variable Molecular Weight Nanoparticles (VMWNPs) were used in 
different reviewed studies. The results of reviewed studies revealed that the 
nanoparticle-based hyperthermia technique as a new progressive modality can 
significantly improve treatment outcomes for some special cancers. Increasing 
life expectancy by up to 30% using Iron Oxide magnetic nanoparticle-based 
hyperthermia for pancreatic cancer and increasing tumor ablation by about 33% 
for other cancers were reported in reviewed articles. However, further studies 
are required to extend this new treatment technique to other cancers and for 
providing more accurate information on nanoparticle-based hyperthermia's 
effectiveness as a complementary technique in cancer treatment.

[Current management and new treatment strategies of chronic myeloid leukemia].

The introduction of orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) into the 
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 25 years ago has substantially 
improved the clinical outcome of affected patients and resulted in a near-normal 
life expectancy in chronic phase (CP). Despite of a significant fraction of 
currently about one third of newly diagnosed CP patients eventually reaching 
treatment-free remission, the majority of patients still remain on life-long 
treatment with TKIs. Therefore, a profound knowledge of TKI-related side effects 
including an increased sensitivity for organ systems predominantly involved, 
grading, kinetics, duration and reversibility, class-effects versus 
compound-relatedness as well as a better understanding of how particularly 
long-lasting, chronic, sometimes formally low-grade toxicities can actually 
significantly impair patient's self-assessed quality of life is of utmost 
importance for an adequate patient/doctor relationship. Given that nowadays, 
severity and degree of preexisting comorbidities might predict long-term 
survival of individual patients more significantly than the underlying CML 
itself, it becomes most important to properly and thoroughly select the TKI of 
choice on this basis as well as on the individually required co-medications. 
Given the variety of 2nd, 3rd and now allosteric TKIs available for the 
molecular targeting of the disease-driving BCR-ABL oncogene in addition to the 
"class-defining" Imatinib, personalization of CML therapy should now be further 
extended towards a better appreciation of comorbidities and co-medications 
before selection of an individual's TKI treatment complemented by a long-term 
oriented, patient-centered management and prevention of (sometimes irreversible) 
TKI side effects.

Publisher: THERAPIEENTSCHEIDUNG: Neben der Wirksamkeit spielen individuelle 
Therapieziele, Komorbiditäten, Komedikationen und auch Compliance-Themen eine 
zunehmende Rolle bei der Auswahl des individuell zu präferierenden 
Tyrosinkinase-Inhibitors (TKI).
NEBENWIRKUNGEN: Hier gilt es, die sog. Klasseneffekte (ein Effekt, der unter 
allen TKIs bei einer bestimmten Klasse von TKIs auftreten kann) von den 
substanzspezifischen Nebenwirkungen der einzelnen TKIs zu unterscheiden. WAS TUN 
BEI NEBENWIRKUNGEN UND UNVERTRäGLICHKEIT?: In Studien konnte gezeigt werden, 
dass durch Anpassung der Dosis des TKIs (ggf. auch mit zeitlich begrenzter 
Therapiepause) und/oder Änderung der Begleitmedikation eine Verbesserung der 
Therapietreue (Adhärenz) in den meisten Fällen erreicht werden konnte. WIE 
KöNNEN TKI-NEBENWIRKUNGEN VERMIEDEN WERDEN?: Zur Evaluation der Belastungen und 
Einschränkungen ist eine gute Arzt-Patienten-Interaktion entscheidend. Hiermit 
wird das Therapieziel einer guten Wirksamkeit und Adhärenz am ehesten erreicht.

AIMS: Intra-articular (IA) tumours around the knee are treated with 
extra-articular (EA) resection, which is associated with poor functional 
outcomes. We aim to evaluate the accuracy of MRI in predicting IA involvement 
around the knee.
METHODS: We identified 63 cases of high-grade sarcomas in or around the distal 
femur that underwent an EA resection from a prospectively maintained database 
(January 1996 to April 2020). Suspicion of IA disease was noted in 52 cases, six 
had IA pathological fracture, two had an effusion, two had prior surgical 
intervention (curettage/IA intervention), and one had an osseous metastasis in 
the proximal tibia. To ascertain validity, two musculoskeletal radiologists (R1, 
R2) reviewed the preoperative imaging (MRI) of 63 consecutive cases on two 
occasions six weeks apart. The radiological criteria for IA disease comprised 
evidence of tumour extension within the suprapatellar pouch, intercondylar 
notch, extension along medial/lateral retinaculum, and presence of IA fracture. 
The radiological predictions were then confirmed with the final histopathology 
of the resected specimens.
RESULTS: The resection histology revealed 23 cases (36.5%) showing IA disease 
involvement compared with 40 cases without (62%). The intraobserver variability 
of R1 was 0.85 (p < 0.001) compared to R2 with κ = 0.21 (p = 0.007). The 
interobserver variability was κ = 0.264 (p = 0.003). Knee effusion was found to 
be the most sensitive indicator of IA involvement, with a sensitivity of 91.3% 
but specificity of only 35%. However, when combined with a pathological 
fracture, this rose to 97.5% and 100% when disease was visible in Hoffa's fat 
pad.
CONCLUSION: MRI imaging can sometimes overestimate IA joint involvement and 
needs to be correlated with clinical signs. In the light of our findings, we 
would recommend EA resections when imaging shows effusion combined with either

Eusocial insect reproductive females show strikingly longer life spans than 
nonreproductive female workers despite high genetic similarity. In the ant 
Harpegnathos saltator (Hsal), workers can transition to reproductive 
"gamergates," acquiring a fivefold prolonged life span by mechanisms that are 
poorly understood. We found that gamergates have elevated expression of heat 
shock response (HSR) genes in the absence of heat stress and enhanced survival 
with heat stress. This HSR gene elevation is driven in part by 
gamergate-specific up-regulation of the gene encoding a truncated form of a heat 
shock factor most similar to mammalian HSF2 (hsalHSF2). In workers, hsalHSF2 was 
bound to DNA only upon heat stress. In gamergates, hsalHSF2 bound to DNA even in 
the absence of heat stress and was localized to gamergate-biased HSR genes. 
Expression of hsalHSF2 in Drosophila melanogaster led to enhanced heat shock 
survival and extended life span in the absence of heat stress. Molecular 
characterization illuminated multiple parallels between long-lived flies and 
gamergates, underscoring the centrality of hsalHSF2 to extended ant life span. 
Hence, ant caste-specific heat stress resilience and extended longevity can be 
transferred to flies via hsalHSF2. These findings reinforce the critical role of
