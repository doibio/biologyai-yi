BACKGROUND: Diabetes self-management education can be helpful for patients with 
type 2 diabetes in managing their condition. We aimed to study the effects of 
the group-based PRoactive Interdisciplinary Self-MAnagement (PRISMA) training 
program on self-reported and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes 
treated in general practice.
METHODS: Persons aged 18 years or older diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 
treated in primary care were included. In a randomized controlled trial design 
(1:1), patients were followed for 6 months with an extension phase of 6 months. 
Block randomization was used. The patients with type 2 diabetes received either 
PRISMA in addition to usual care or usual care only. All patients completed a 
range of validated questionnaires (including knowledge, skills, and confidence 
for self-management [PAM], diabetes self-care behavior [SDSCA], health-related 
quality of life [EQ-5D], and emotional well-being [WHO-5]). In addition, 
clinical outcomes (HbA1c, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and 
cholesterol levels) were collected during the routine diabetes checkups.
RESULTS: Of the total sample (n = 193), 60.1% were men. The mean age was 
69.9 years (SD = 9.1). No significant differences were found on self-reported 
outcomes between the groups at 0, 6, and 12 months. The clinical outcomes were 
not reported due to a large number of missing values.
CONCLUSION: PRISMA did not improve self-reported outcomes in patients with type 
2 diabetes treated in primary care. It was not possible to make a statement 
about the clinical effects.

Cardiac conduction defects decrease life expectancy in myotonic dystrophy type 1 
(DM1), a CTG repeat disorder involving misbalance between two RNA binding 
factors, MBNL1 and CELF1. However, how DM1 condition translates into conduction 
disorders remains poorly understood. Here we simulated MBNL1 and CELF1 
misbalance in the Drosophila heart and performed TU-tagging-based RNAseq of 
cardiac cells. We detected deregulations of several genes controlling cellular 
calcium levels, including increased expression of straightjacket/α2δ3, which 
encodes a regulatory subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel. Straightjacket 
overexpression in the fly heart leads to asynchronous heartbeat, a hallmark of 
abnormal conduction, whereas cardiac straightjacket knockdown improves these 
symptoms in DM1 fly models. We also show that ventricular α2δ3 expression is low 
in healthy mice and humans, but significantly elevated in ventricular muscles 
from DM1 patients with conduction defects. These findings suggest that reducing 
ventricular straightjacket/α2δ3 levels could offer a strategy to prevent 
conduction defects in DM1.

training.

Transtibial amputees may experience decreased quality of life due to increased 
risk of knee joint osteoarthritis (OA). No prior studies have compared knee 
joint biomechanics for the same group of transtibial amputees in gait, cycling, 
and elliptical training. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify preferred 
exercises for transtibial amputees in the context of reducing risk of knee OA. 
The hypotheses were: 1) knee biomechanics would differ due to participant status 
(amputee, control), exercise, and leg type (intact, residual) and 2) gait 
kinematic parameters would differ due to participant status and leg type. Ten 
unilateral transtibial amputee and ten control participants performed exercises 
while kinematic and kinetic data were collected. Two-factor repeated measures 
analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey tests and non-parametric equivalents 
were performed to determine significance. Maximum knee compressive force, 
extension torque, and abduction torque were lowest in cycling and highest in 
gait regardless of participant type. Amputee maximum knee extension torque was 
higher in the intact vs. residual knee in gait. Amputee maximum knee flexion 
angle was higher in the residual vs. intact knee in gait and elliptical. Gait 
midstance knee flexion angle timing was asymmetrical for amputees and knee angle 
was lower in the amputee residual vs. control non-dominant knees. The results 
suggest that cycling, and likely other non-weight bearing exercises, may be 
preferred exercises for amputees due to significant reductions in biomechanical 
asymmetries and joint loads.

Calciphylaxis: Approach to Diagnosis and Management.

Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder of poor prognosis that can lead to intense, 
painful lesions involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Although mostly 
described in dialysis patients, it can affect patients with normal kidney 
function. The diagnosis of calciphylaxis is complicated by the absence of a gold 
standard marker of disease such as a clear histopathological finding. Late 
diagnosis and advanced lesions can significantly shorten life expectancy. 
Calciphylaxis wounds can have a major influence on the quality of life of 
patients, usually due to the immense unbearable pain these patients suffer from. 
The management of calciphylaxis mainly comprises aggressive wound care and 
symptomatic management. Therapeutic options are few and far between and are 
limited to off-label uses. Recent understanding of the pathogenesis of lesions 
has enabled development of novel therapeutic options, some of which are being 
studied in clinical trials (sodium thiosulfate, vitamin K). Vascular 
calcification and thrombosis underlie development of these lesions and research 
has been aimed at studying drugs that counteract such processes. Future research 
is required to establish clear causal pathways and improve on the treatment 
options currently available to patients.

INTRODUCTION: Orbital exenteration is a radical anatomically and psychologically 
disfiguring procedure. It is mostly performed for management of orbital cancers 
or cancers with orbital involvement. The lack of benefit in terms of overall 
survival and the development of new molecular therapies (targeted therapies, 
immunotherapy) in recent years leads us to question its use. The goal of our 
review is to answer to the following question: is orbital exenteration a viable 
procedure in 2019?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review was performed using the PUBMED and 
MEDLINE databases. The following terms were used then crossed with each other: 
"orbital exenteration", "exenterated socket", "overall survival", "life 
expectancy", "orbital reconstruction", "socket reconstruction". Oncology 
articles from the past 15 years were included and separated into those in the 
oculoplastic literature and those in the ENT literature.
RESULTS: Nineteen articles were included in this review. Eyelid tumours 
represent the main etiology of orbital exenteration. Basal cell carcinoma is the 
most frequently incriminated tumor, while sebaceous carcinoma and conjunctival 
squamous cell carcinoma are the most frequently encountered in Asian series. 
Non-conservative orbital exenteration is the most prevalent surgery performed. 
Orbital reconstruction depends on the surgeon's speciality: healing by secondary 
intention and split thickness skin grafts are mostly performed by oculoplastic 
surgeons, whereas regional or free flaps are mostly performed by ENT surgeons. 
Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is the most common intraoperative complication, 
encountered in 0 to 13 % of cases. The most common postoperative complications 
are ethmoid fistula and infection of the operative site, encountered in 0 to 
50 % and 0 to 43 % of cases respectively. Orbital exenteration allows surgical 
resection of R0 tumors in 42.5 % to 97 % of cases. Overall survival following 
orbital exenteration is 83 % (50.5-97) and 65 % (37-92) at 1 and 5 years 
respectively. Identified risk factors for poor overall survival are: age, tumor 
histology (worse prognosis with choroidal melanoma, better prognosis with basal 
cell carcinoma), non-R0 surgical resection, locally advanced tumors (size>20mm, 
BCVA<20/400 and the presence of metastases at diagnosis). Recent studies have 
demonstrated favorable outcomes when managing locally advanced basal cell 
carcinoma, lacrimal gland cancer and conjunctival melanoma with targeted 
therapies or immunotherapies without performing orbital exenteration.
CONCLUSION: Orbital exenteration remains a major part of our therapeutic 
arsenal. Although orbital exenteration has failed to demonstrate any overall 
survival benefit, it allows satisfactory local control of the disease with an 
increasingly less invasive procedure. The development of targeted therapies and 
immunotherapies may change our therapeutic decisions in the future.

Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major Ca2+ influx pathway that is 
controlled by the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1. Abnormal activation of STIM1 directly 
influences Ca2+ influx, resulting in severe diseases such as Stormorken 
syndrome. The inactivation domain of STIM1 (IDstim) has been identified as being 
essential for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of STIM1 (CDI) after SOCE occurs. 
However, it is unknown whether IDstim is involved in keeping STIM1 inactive 
before CDI. Herein, we show that IDstim helps STIM1 keep inactive through 
intramolecular binding with the coiled-coil domain. Between IDstim and the 
coiled-coil domain, we found a short conserved linker whose extension or 
mutation leads to the constitutive activation of STIM1. We have demonstrated 
that IDstim needs the coiled-coil domain 1 (CC1) to inhibit the Ca2+ 
release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) activation domain (CAD) activity and binds to a 
CC1-CAD fragment. Serial deletion of CC1 revealed that CC1α1 is a co-inhibitory 
domain of IDstim. CC1α1 deletion or leucine mutation, which abolishes the closed 
conformation, impaired the inhibitory effect and binding of IDstim. These 
results suggest that IDstim cooperates with CC1α1 to help STIM1 keep inactive 
under resting conditions.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus standard 
chemotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the US payer perspective.
DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. 
Health outcomes were estimated in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost 
information was from Medicare in 2018. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses examined the impact of uncertainty and assumptions on the results.
SETTING: The US payer perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical US cohort of patients with previously untreated 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations.
INTERVENTIONS: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy expressed as cost per QALY gained 
compared with chemotherapy RESULTS: The base case analysis demonstrated that 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy provided an additional 0.78 QALYs at incremental 
cost of $151 409, resulting in an ICER of $194 372/QALY. ICER for pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy was >$149 680/QALY in all of our univariable and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab in addition to chemotherapy provides modest 
incremental benefit at high incremental cost per QALY for the treatment of 
previously untreated metastatic NSCLC.

Local Childcare Availability and Dual-Earner Fertility: Variation in Childcare 
Coverage and Birth Hazards Over Place and Time.

Antwerp, Belgium.

The theoretically well-grounded hypothesis that the availability of formal 
childcare has a positive impact on childbearing in the developed world has been 
part of the population literature for a long time. Whereas the participation of 
women in the labour force created a tension between work and family life, the 
increasing availability of formal childcare in many developed countries is 
assumed to reconcile these two life domains due to lower opportunity costs and 
compatible mother and worker roles. However, previous empirical studies on the 
association between childcare availability and fertility exhibit ambiguous 
results and considerable variation in the methods applied. This study assesses 
the childcare-fertility hypothesis for Belgium, a consistently top-ranked 
country concerning formal childcare coverage that also exhibits considerable 
variation within the country. Using detailed longitudinal census and register 
data for the 2000s combined with childcare coverage rates for 588 municipalities 
and allowing for the endogenous nature of formal childcare and selective 
migration, our findings indicate clear and substantial positive effects of local 
formal childcare provision on birth hazards, especially when considering the 
transition to parenthood. In addition, this article quantifies the impact of 
local formal childcare availability on fertility at the aggregate level and 
shows that in the context of low and lowest-low fertility levels in the 
developed world, the continued extension of formal childcare services can be a 
fruitful tool to stimulate childbearing among dual-earner couples.

The "UFO" procedure.

The term "UFO" is not a medical term, but helps emphasize the extremely high 
degree of complexity of a surgical repair that is akin to someone observing an 
unidentified flying object. It involves replacement of the mitral and aortic 
valves with reconstruction of the intervalvular fibrous body (IVFB). Specific 
pathologies that render this operation necessary usually involve the IVFB, which 
is located between the aortic and mitral valves and constitutes a major portion 
of the fibrous skeleton of the heart. Patients that most often require such an 
operation are those with extensive aortic and mitral valve endocarditis with 
perivalvular extension into the IVFB. Other infrequent situations such as severe 
aortic and mitral annular calcification involving the IVFB, double valve 
replacement in patients with extremely small aortic and mitral annuli or double 
valve reoperations in which no IVFB is available following excision of both 
valves, necessitating the UFO procedure. The basic surgical principle has been 
first described as early as 1980. Depending on the extent of excised tissue due 
to the underlying disease, modifications and additional complex repair 
techniques have to be adopted. It is of utmost importance to have adequate 
visibility and exposure. There are certain important structures, which are at a 
risk of either injury or neglect, that can result in development of 
life-threatening complications during this operation, which a surgeon should be 
aware of. A step by step description of the "UFO" procedure can help guide the 
surgeon to perform this operation safely and efficiently. Although clinical 
complications are high, they are often related to the underlying disease and not 
specifically to the procedure itself, if performed perfectly.

The elderly population growth rate is extremely high in Korean society, and life 
expectancy is close to 85 years old for women and 80 for men as of people born 
in 2015. The future hip fracture prediction model of Korea shows that the 
elderly hip fracture rate will increase by 1.4 times by 2025, which will impose 
a serious socioeconomic burden on Korean society and become a key issue of 
public health management. The fracture liaison service (FLS) is defined adequate 
treatment and services for patients over 50 years old with fragility fractures, 
enabling systematic identification and decreasing the risk of subsequent 
osteoporotic fractures. In Korean society, the introduction of FLS, which is 
verified not only in the socioeconomic aspects but also in the treatment of 
patients, is thought to be essential. However, the challenges that need to be 
addressed in order to implement FLS include the lack of awareness regarding the 
necessity of this system, the lack of healthcare systems, and inadequate 
policies. In the future, further studies on the FLS and its clinical and 
socioeconomic effects for the Korean medical system will be necessary.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pro-protein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in cardiovascular disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive search strategy in electronic 
databases from January 2015 to January 2019. Out of 475 articles, 16 were 
entered into the study. Quality-adjusted life year, life years gained (LYG), 
annual cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) regarding the 
use of PCSK9 inhibitors were considered as the key outcomes. The 
cost-effectiveness threshold varied from $45,000 in Spain to $150,000 in the 
USA. The annual cost of PCSK9 inhibitors for studies undertaken in the USA was 
in the range of $14,000 to $15,000, while it was about $7000 for other developed 
countries. The results showed that reduction in the price of PCSK9 inhibitors 
changed from 20 to 88%. The means of QALY were 0.65 and 0.67 in the Markov and 
Cardiovascular Disease Policy Modeling (CVDPM) models; also, the ICER means were 
$197,707 and $625,555 for the Markov and CVDPM model, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the current study, the effectiveness of PCSK9 
inhibitors is well documented, although all studies pointed out a higher cost of 
these inhibitors.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered within the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database of the University 
of York (CRD42018088472).

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of the 
core disease-specific 14-item German HeartQoL questionnaire.
METHODS: As an extension of the international HeartQol Project, cross-sectional 
and longitudinal health-related quality of life (HRQL) data were collected from 
305 patients with angina (N = 101), myocardial infarction (N = 123), or ischemic 
heart failure (N = 81) in Austria and Switzerland using German versions of the 
HeartQoL, the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale. The underlying factor structure was examined with Mokken 
Scaling analysis; then convergent, divergent, and discriminative validity, 
internal consistency reliability, and responsiveness were assessed.
RESULTS: The highest HRQL scores were reported by patients with myocardial 
infarction followed by ischemic heart failure and then angina. The two-factor 
structure was confirmed with strong physical, emotional, and global scale H 
coefficients (> .50). Divergent and convergent validity (from r = .04 to .78) 
were shown for each diagnosis; discriminative validity was verified as well 
(partially: age, sex, and disease severity; largely: SF-36 health 
status/transition; totally: anxiety and depression). Internal consistency 
reliability was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = .91). In terms of responsiveness, 
physical and global scale scores improved significantly after percutaneous 
coronary intervention (p < .01) while after cardiac rehabilitation all scale 
scores improved significantly (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The German HeartQoL questionnaire is a valid and reliable HRQL 
instrument with these data supporting its potential use in clinical practice and 
research to assess and compare HRQL in German-speaking patients with ischemic 
heart disease. The shortness of the tool may prove to be helpful particularly in 
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: The PIONEER trial programme showed that, after 52 weeks, the novel 
oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide 14 mg was associated 
with significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) versus a 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 mg), a dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin 100 mg) and an injectable GLP-1 analogue 
(liraglutide 1.8 mg). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide 14 mg versus each of these 
comparators in the UK setting.
METHODS: Analyses were performed from a healthcare payer perspective using the 
IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model, in which outcomes were projected over patient 
lifetimes (50 years). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were 
based on 52-week data from the PIONEER 2, 3 and 4 randomised controlled trials, 
comparing oral semaglutide with empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide, 
respectively. Treatment switching occurred when HbA1c exceeded 7.5% 
(58 mmol/mol). Utilities, treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related 
complications (in pounds sterling [GBP]) were taken from published sources. The 
acquisition cost of oral semaglutide was assumed to match that of once-weekly 
semaglutide.
RESULTS: Oral semaglutide was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus 
empagliflozin, 0.20 QALYs versus sitagliptin and 0.07 QALYs versus liraglutide. 
Direct costs over a patient's lifetime were GBP 971 and GBP 963 higher with oral 
semaglutide than with empagliflozin and sitagliptin, respectively, but GBP 1551 
lower versus liraglutide. Oral semaglutide was associated with a reduced 
incidence of diabetes-related complications versus all comparators. Therefore, 
oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
of GBP 11,006 and 4930 per QALY gained versus empagliflozin 25 mg and 
sitagliptin 100 mg, respectively, and was more effective and less costly 
(dominant) versus liraglutide 1.8 mg.
CONCLUSION: Oral semaglutide was cost-effective versus empagliflozin and 
sitagliptin, and dominant versus liraglutide, for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes in the UK.

The Nurse's Role in Prognosis-Related Communication in Pediatric Oncology 
Nursing Practice.

The experiences of pediatric oncology nurses with prognosis-related 
communication (PRC) remain largely unknown. The purpose of this article is to 
report results of focus groups wherein 15 pediatric oncology nurses from three 
Midwestern pediatric cancer programs provided descriptions of PRC and how they 
experience PRC within their daily practice. Data from focus groups were analyzed 
via an interpretive descriptive approach, which resulted in three themes: (1) 
nurses' operational definition of PRC, (2) nurses' roles in PRC, and (3) nurses' 
preparation for engagement in PRC. From discussions within the focus groups, 
nurses recognized that PRC occurs across a continuum. Nurses distinguished that 
the definition of PRC expands beyond simply reporting life expectancy to 
describing the consequences of cancer- and treatment-related toxicities and 
effects. When nurses are not actively invited by their physician partners to 
participate in PRC, nurses will often develop workarounds to ensure that they 
understand what was said to patients and families. This allows them to function 
more effectively as supporters, advocates, and informants. Nurses described 
little preparation to participate in such challenging conversations. Pediatric 
oncology nurses need to acknowledge and embrace that they are an integral part 
of PRC. Interprofessional communication training is necessary to enhance the 
comfort and confidence of nurses engaging in PRC.

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing increases the complexity of the proteome that can 
be generated from the available genomic coding sequences. Dysregulation of the 
splicing process has been implicated in a vast repertoire of diseases. However, 
splicing has recently been linked to both the aging process itself and 
pro-longevity interventions. This review focuses on recent research towards 
defining RNA splicing as a new hallmark of aging. We highlight dysfunctional 
alternative splicing events that contribute to the aging phenotype across 
multiple species, along with recent efforts toward deciphering mechanistic roles 
for RNA splicing in the regulation of aging and longevity. Further, we discuss 
recent research demonstrating a direct requirement for specific splicing factors 
in pro-longevity interventions, and specifically how nutrient signaling pathways 
interface to splicing factor regulation and downstream splicing targets. 
Finally, we review the emerging potential of using splicing profiles as a 
predictor of biological age and life expectancy. Understanding the role of RNA 
splicing components and downstream targets altered in aging may provide 
opportunities to develop therapeutics and ultimately extend healthy lifespan in 
humans.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) prevalence has increased rapidly in Europe as a result 
of an increase in the life expectancy of these patients and the arrival of SCD 
migrants from Africa. The aim of our study was to compare the phenotypes of 
adult patients born in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) who migrated to France with 
those of patients with the same origin who were born in France. This 
single-center observational study compared the demographic, clinical and 
biological characteristics of SCD adult patients of SSA origin who were born in 
France or SSA. Data were collected from computerized medical charts. Groups were 
compared using multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for age, gender 
and type of SCD. Of the 323 SCD patients followed in our center, 235 were 
enrolled, including 111 patients born in France and 124 patients born in SSA. 
SCD genotypes were balanced between groups. Patients born in Africa were older 
(median age 32.1 (24.4-39) vs. 25.6 (22.1-30.5) years, p < 0.001) and more often 
women (n = 75 (60.5%) vs. 48 (43.2%), p = 0.008). The median age at arrival in 
France was 18 years (13-23). The median height was lower among patients born in 
SSA (169 (163-175) vs. 174.5 cm (168-179), p < 0.001). Over their lifetimes, 
patients born in France had more acute chest syndromes (median number 2 (1-4) 
vs. 1 (0-3), p = 0.002), with the first episode occurring earlier (19 
(11.6-22.3) vs. 24 (18.4-29.5) years, p < 0.007), and were admitted to intensive 
care units more often (53.3% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.006). This difference was more 
pronounced in the SS/Sβ0 population. Conversely, patients born in SSA had more 
skin ulcers (19.4% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.03). No significant differences were found in 
social and occupational insertion or other complications between the two groups. 
Patients born in SSA had a less severe disease phenotype regardless of their age 
than those born in France. This difference could be related to a survival bias 
occurring in Africa during childhood and migration to Europe that selected the 
least severe phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Hospices provide multidimensional care. In the Netherlands, patients 
with <3 months estimated life expectancy have access to hospice care. Insight 
into patients admitted to hospices and the care provided is lacking. In 
preparation for a national multicenter study, a pilot study was performed.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to test the appropriateness of the study 
procedures and the availability of hospice patient records (HPRs), and patient 
and care characteristics.
METHOD: A cross-sectional pilot study was performed using a descriptive 
exploratory design. Sixteen hospices were invited to participate, and HPRs from 
8 deceased patients per hospice were selected. Data were collected using 
self-developed electronic case report forms.
OUTCOMES: (1). Appropriateness of procedures: availability of HPRs and 
identified barriers and strategies. (2) Availability of patient and care 
characteristics in HPRs.
RESULTS: In total, 104 HPRs of patients from 13 hospices were enrolled. Various 
types of HPRs were found with different availabilities: nurses' records were 
most available (98%) compared to volunteers' records (62%). Overarching barriers 
were as follows: ethical issues, lack of knowledge, and lack of communication. 
Information about the illness was most available (97%), whereas descriptions of 
experienced symptoms were least available (10%).
CONCLUSION: Collecting HPRs is difficult and time-consuming. Specifically, data 
from separate records of home care nurses and general practitioners were 
difficult to come by. Patient and care characteristics were alternately present, 
which led to an extension of data collection in HPRs to 3 time periods. Piloting 
is essential to adjust study procedures and outcome measures to ensure a 
feasible national multicenter hospice study.

Sublethal effects of methylthio-diafenthiuron on the life table parameters and 
enzymatic properties of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) 
(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae).

The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), is a major pest affecting 
cruciferous vegetables, and seriously affects the quality and yield of these 
vegetables. Diafenthiuron is a traditional thiourea-based insecticide, but it is 
rarely used to control pests on cruciferous vegetables due to its phytotoxicity 
on these vegetables under high temperature and light conditions. Thus, there is 
an ongoing need for more effective pesticides that can be used on cruciferous 
vegetables, possibly including new formulations of diafenthiuron. A new thiourea 
insecticide, methylthio-diafenthiuron, is intended to optimize the structure of 
diafenthiuron not only to preserve its insecticidal bioactivity but also to 
overcome its phytotoxicity to cruciferous vegetables, aiming to control insect 
pests on cruciferous vegetables. In this study, we compared the toxicity of 
methylthio-diafenthiuron to some frequently used insecticides on the 
third-instar larvae of DBM. The parental pupal duration was significantly longer 
under the treatment than in the control, but the pupal weight, fecundity, and 
hatching rate significantly decreased. By studying the changes in three 
detoxifying enzymes within 72 h after treatment with a sublethal concentration, 
the activity of CarE and ODM in the treatment group significantly increased at 
first and then decreased. In addition, methylthio-diafenthiuron clearly 
inhibited three kinds of ATPases in the DBM and significantly reduced the 
eclosion rate of the pupae. This research provides valuable information for the 
assessment and rational application of methylthio-diafenthiuron for the control 
of pests on cruciferous vegetables.

BACKGROUND: Latin America is one of the most unequal regions in the world, but 
evidence is lacking on the magnitude of health inequalities in urban areas of 
the region. Our objective was to examine inequalities in life expectancy in six 
large Latin American cities and its association with a measure of area-level 
socioeconomic status.
METHODS: In this ecological analysis, we used data from the Salud Urbana en 
America Latina (SALURBAL) study on six large cities in Latin America (Buenos 
Aires, Argentina; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; San José, Costa Rica; 
Mexico City, Mexico; and Panama City, Panama), comprising 266 subcity units, for 
the period 2011-15 (expect for Panama city, which was for 2012-16). We 
calculated average life expectancy at birth by sex and subcity unit with life 
tables using age-specific mortality rates estimated from a Bayesian model, and 
calculated the difference between the ninth and first decile of life expectancy 
at birth (P90-P10 gap) across subcity units in cities. We also analysed the 
association between life expectancy at birth and socioeconomic status at the 
subcity-unit level, using education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and 
whether any geographical patterns existed in cities between subcity units.
FINDINGS: We found large spatial differences in average life expectancy at birth 
in Latin American cities, with the largest P90-P10 gaps observed in Panama City 
(15·0 years for men and 14·7 years for women), Santiago (8·9 years for men and 
17·7 years for women), and Mexico City (10·9 years for men and 9·4 years for 
women), and the narrowest in Buenos Aires (4·4 years for men and 5·8 years for 
women), Belo Horizonte (4·0 years for men and 6·5 years for women), and San José 
(3·9 years for men and 3·0 years for women). Higher area-level socioeconomic 
status was associated with higher life expectancy, especially in Santiago 
(change in life expectancy per P90-P10 change unit-level of educational 
attainment 8·0 years [95% CI 5·8-10·3] for men and 11·8 years [7·1-16·4] for
