nuclei/fiber, P = 0.06), with the only significant increase observed in type I 
fibers, which decreased the myonuclear domain size of type I fibers (P = 0.05). 
Satellite cell numbers and the content of androgen receptor and myostatin 
remained unchanged. Sixteen weeks of strength training during ADT increased type 
II fiber CSA and reduced myonuclear domain in type I fibers in PCa patients. The 
increased number of satellite cells normally seen following strength training 
was not observed.

OBJECTIVE: The quality-adjusted life year, which is usually calculated from the 
health utility value, is now a standard measurement used in political 
decision-making in health. Although depression is the leading cause of decrement 
in health utility in general population, impact of comorbid depression among 
cancer patients has not been studied sufficiently. Therefore, this study aimed 
to measure the impact of depression on cancer patients' health utility score, 
according to the severity of depression.
METHODS: Impact of depression severity (measured by the Patient Health 
Questionnaire) on health utility score (measured by the EuroQoL-5 scale) was 
evaluated in a sample of 328 Japanese cancer patients, controlling for 
performance status, symptom burden, and demographic variables.
RESULTS: The patients with depression had significantly lower health utility 
value than those without depression (mean decrement = 0.14). Decrements in 
health utility of 0.13, 0.18, and 0.19 were observed for mild, moderate, and 
moderately severe to severe level of depression, respectively. The difference 
was significant between groups. Depression severity was a significant predictor 
for health utility (standardized coefficient beta = -0.25), which was comparable 
with physical symptom burden and performance status. Participants' age, gender, 
cancer stage, and comorbid illness were not significant. The model explained 
37.9% of the variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Even mild level of depression caused clinically meaningful 
decrement in health utility value in cancer patients, which was comparable with 
decrements due to major physical complications of cancer. Influence of 
depression should be carefully investigated when interpreting the 
quality-adjusted life year among cancer patients. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &

Society makes substantial investments in biomedical research, searching for ways 
to better human health. The product of this research is principally information 
published in scientific journals. Continued investment in science relies on 
society's confidence in the accuracy, honesty, and utility of research results. 
A recent focus on productivity has dominated the competitive evaluation of 
scientists, creating incentives to maximize publication numbers, citation 
counts, and publications in high-impact journals. Some studies have also 
suggested a decreasing quality in the published literature. The efficiency of 
society's investments in biomedical research, in terms of improved health 
outcomes, has not been studied. We show that biomedical research outcomes over 
the last five decades, as estimated by both life expectancy and New Molecular 
Entities approved by the Food and Drug Administration, have remained relatively 
constant despite rising resource inputs and scientific knowledge. Research 
investments by the National Institutes of Health over this time correlate with 
publication and author numbers but not with the numerical development of novel 
therapeutics. We consider several possibilities for the growing input-outcome 
disparity including the prior elimination of easier research questions, 
increasing specialization, overreliance on reductionism, a disproportionate 
emphasis on scientific outputs, and other negative pressures on the scientific 
enterprise. Monitoring the efficiency of research investments in producing 
positive societal outcomes may be a useful mechanism for weighing the efficacy 
of reforms to the scientific enterprise. Understanding the causes of the 
increasing input-outcome disparity in biomedical research may improve society's 
confidence in science and provide support for growing future research 
investments.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis and clinical consequences of white matter abnormalities 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phenylketonuric (PKU) patients are 
incompletely known.
OBJECTIVE: To study white matter alterations progression and outcome and its 
relationships with phenylalanine levels and intelligence quotient (IQ) in early 
treated PKU subjects who underwent serial MRIs during a prolonged follow-up.
METHODS: 47 early treated PKU patients (mean age 25.1 ± 5.6 years; range 12-37 
years) have been enrolled when two or more consecutive brain MRIs, a complete 
biochemical history, and MRI-concurrent blood phenylalanine levels were 
available. The severity and extension of white matter abnormalities were 
expressed in a computed score. Consecutive IQ assessments were available in 24 
patients. We analyzed intra- and interindividual white matter alterations 
variations and their relationship with quality of biochemical control and 
cognitive outcome.
RESULTS: Early treated PKU patients showed a high rate of white matter 
alterations with a relevant increase in frequency/severity from the second 
decade of life onwards. Age and quality of dietary control before or between 
subsequent examinations showed an independent cumulative effect on white matter 
alterations outcome. No significant association was found between white matter 
alterations and cognitive outcome. A remarkable interindividual variability was 
found and several patients disclosed incongruity between the trajectory of white 
matter alterations and biochemical control. About 30% of white matter 
alterations variability remains unexplained by the disease-associated 
determinants.
CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of white matter alterations is not significantly 
affected by intellectual outcome and is affected by aging, chronic exposure to 
phenylalanine, and unknown individual factors.

The Impact of Buttonhole Cannulation on Patients and Staff in Hemodialysis 
Facilities.

The two reasons that patients desire buttonhole cannulation are avoidance of 
puncture pain and extension of arteriovenous fistula life. Despite the desire to 
receive buttonhole cannulation by many patients, medical staff at most local 
hemodialysis facilities tend to hesitate to implement the cannulation method. 
This method is used on patients in the dialysis unit at Saitama Medical Center, 
but tends to be discontinued for those patients upon their transfer to local 
hemodialysis facilities. Medical staff members of one local hemodialysis 
facility report the percentage of patients on the buttonhole method was 53% in 
2007, but that it sharply decreased to 17% in 2013. Hesitation by local 
hemodialysis facilities to adopt the buttonhole method is due to, but not 
limited to, several factors. These factors include the frequently occurring 
trampoline effect, the difficulty of removing scabs, formation of a false 
buttonhole track, and the pain from insertion of a dull needle. Perceived 
differences in the value of buttonhole cannulation may potentially affect 
communication between patients and staff in local hemodialysis facilities.

The high prevalence of severe pressure ulcers (PUs) is an important issue that 
requires to be highlighted in Japan. In a previous study, we devised an advanced 
PU management protocol to enable early detection of and intervention for deep 
tissue injury and critical colonization. This protocol was effective for 
preventing more severe PUs. The present study aimed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of the care provided using an advanced PU management 
protocol, from a medical provider's perspective, implemented by trained wound, 
ostomy, and continence nurses (WOCNs), with that of conventional care provided 
by a control group of WOCNs. A Markov model was constructed for a 1-year time 
horizon to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of advanced PU 
management compared with conventional care. The number of quality-adjusted 
life-years gained, and the cost in Japanese yen (¥) ($US1 = ¥120; 2015) was used 
as the outcome. Model inputs for clinical probabilities and related costs were 
based on our previous clinical trial results. Univariate sensitivity analyses 
were performed. Furthermore, a Bayesian multivariate probability sensitivity 
analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulations with advanced PU 
management. Two different models were created for initial cohort distribution. 
For both models, the expected effectiveness for the intervention group using 
advanced PU management techniques was high, with a low expected cost value. The 
sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were robust. Intervention by 
WOCNs using advanced PU management techniques was more effective and 
cost-effective than conventional care.

IMPORTANCE: Low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended over warfarin for the 
treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with active cancer 
largely based on results of a single, large trial.
OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of tinzaparin vs warfarin for 
treatment of acute, symptomatic VTE in patients with active cancer.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, open-label study with blinded 
central adjudication of study outcomes enrolled patients in 164 centers in Asia, 
Africa, Europe, and North, Central, and South America between August 2010 and 
November 2013. Adult patients with active cancer (defined as histologic 
diagnosis of cancer and receiving anticancer therapy or diagnosed with, or 
received such therapy, within the previous 6 months) and objectively documented 
proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism, with a life 
expectancy greater than 6 months and without contraindications for 
anticoagulation, were followed up for 180 days and for 30 days after the last 
study medication dose for collection of safety data.
INTERVENTIONS: Tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) once daily for 6 months vs conventional 
therapy with tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) once daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 
warfarin at a dose adjusted to maintain the international normalized ratio 
within the therapeutic range (2.0-3.0) for 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary efficacy outcome was a composite of 
centrally adjudicated recurrent DVT, fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and 
incidental VTE. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, clinically relevant 
nonmajor bleeding, and overall mortality.
RESULTS: Nine hundred patients were randomized and included in 
intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses. Recurrent VTE occurred in 31 of 
449 patients treated with tinzaparin and 45 of 451 patients treated with 
warfarin (6-month cumulative incidence, 7.2% for tinzaparin vs 10.5% for 
warfarin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41-1.03]; P = .07). There were no 
differences in major bleeding (12 patients for tinzaparin vs 11 patients for 
warfarin; HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.40-1.99]; P = .77) or overall mortality (150 
patients for tinzaparin vs 138 patients for warfarin; HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 
0.85-1.36]; P = .54). A significant reduction in clinically relevant nonmajor 
bleeding was observed with tinzaparin (49 of 449 patients for tinzaparin vs 69 
of 451 patients for warfarin; HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.40-0.84]; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with active cancer and acute 
symptomatic VTE, the use of full-dose tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) daily compared with 
warfarin for 6 months did not significantly reduce the composite measure of 
recurrent VTE and was not associated with reductions in overall mortality or 
major bleeding, but was associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant 
nonmajor bleeding. Further studies are needed to assess whether the efficacy 
outcomes would be different in patients at higher risk of recurrent VTE.

Robust disease resistance may require an expenditure of energy that may limit 
crop yield potential. In the present study, a subset of a United States 
Department of Agriculture rice core collection consisting of 151 accessions was 
selected using a major blast resistance (R) gene, Pi-ta, marker and was 
genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Disease reactions to 
Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, were evaluated under 
greenhouse and field conditions, and heading date, plant height, paddy and brown 
seed weight in two field environments were analyzed, using an association 
mapping approach. A total of 21 SSR markers distributed among rice chromosomes 2 
to 12 were associated with blast resistance, and 16 SSR markers were associated 
with seed weight, heading date, and plant height. Most noticeably, shorter 
plants were significantly correlated with resistance to blast, rice genomes with 
Pi-ta were associated with lighter seed weights, and the susceptible alleles of 
RM171 and RM6544 were associated with heavier seed weight. These findings 
unraveled a complex relationship between disease resistance and yield-related 
components.

Sebox regulates mesoderm formation in early amphibian embryos.

Chen G(1), Tan R(1), Tao Q(1).

Author information:
(1)MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Tsinghua University School of Life 
Sciences, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: Mix/Bix genes are important regulators of mesendoderm formation 
during vertebrate embryogenesis. Sebox, an additional member of this gene 
family, has been implicated in endoderm formation during early embryogenesis in 
zebrafish. However, it remains unclear whether Sebox plays a unique role in 
early Xenopus embryos.
RESULTS: In this study, we provide evidence that Sebox is uniquely required for 
the formation of mesoderm during early Xenopus embryogenesis. Sebox is 
dynamically expressed in the involuted mesoderm during gastrulation. It is 
activated by Nodal/Activin signaling and modulated by zygotic Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling. Overexpression of Sebox perturbs movements during convergent 
extension and inhibits the expression of mesodermal, but not endodermal, genes 
induced by Nodal/Activin signaling. Depletion of Sebox using a specific 
morpholino increases the expression of noncanonical wnt5a, wnt5b, and wnt11b. 
Depletion of Sebox also up-regulates the expression of pcdh8.2, a paraxial 
mesoderm-specific protocadherin, in a Wnt11B-dependent manner. Sebox morphants 
display reduced development of the head and notochord.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that Sebox, a unique member of the Mix/Bix 
gene family, functions downstream of Nodal/Activin signaling and is required for 
the proper expression of noncanonical Wnt ligands and the normal development of 
mesoderm in Xenopus.

[FROM EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE TO PERSONALIZED MEDICINE: THE EXEMPLE OF TYPE 2 
DIABETES].

[Article in French]

Paquot N.

Type 2 diabetes represents a major medical and public health problem due to its 
huge heterogeneity, the alarming rise of its incidence worldwide and its 
associated vascular complications, which impair quality of life and reduce life 
expectancy. At the present time, a patient-centered approach is recommended for 
the management of type 2 diabetes patients. However, these recommendations are 
not easy to implement because we only have little objective evidences to 
establish individualized strategies. Following the recent introduction of new 
drug classes, a large number of combinations is offered to clinicians, but we do 
not have high quality interventional studies comparing these different 
therapeutic possibilities. Moreover, the response to pharmacological treatment 
can vary greatly from one subject to the other. Pharmacogenetics might be a 
useful tool to better characterize the patient. However, despite some progress, 
the evidence we now have is very preliminary and should not allow to improve 
significantly the individual management of type 2 diabetes in the near future.

BACKGROUND: Acute thrombosis of the portal vein (PV) and/or the mesenteric vein 
(MV) is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. A multitude of risk 
factors for acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT)/mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) 
have been identified, including liver cirrhosis, malignancy, coagulation 
disorders, intra-abdominal infection/inflammation, and postoperative condition.
METHODS: This article analyses the treatment options for acute PVT/MVT.
RESULTS: Initially, the clinical management should identify patients with an 
intra-abdominal focus requiring immediate surgical intervention (e.g. bowel 
ischaemia). Subsequently, emphasis is placed on the recanalization of the PV/MV 
or at least the prevention of thrombus extension to avoid long-term 
complications of portal hypertension. Several therapeutic options are currently 
available, including anticoagulation therapy, local/systemic thrombolysis, 
interventional or surgical thrombectomy, and a combination of these procedures. 
Due to the lack of prospective randomized studies, a comparison between these 
therapeutic approaches regarding the efficacy of PV/MV recanalization is 
difficult, if not impossible.
CONCLUSION: In patients with acute PVT/MVT, an individualized treatment based on 
the clinical presentation, the underlying disease, the extent of the thrombosis, 
and the patients' comorbidities is mandatory. Therefore, these patients should 
be considered for an interdisciplinary therapy in specialized centres with the 
option to utilise all therapeutic approaches currently available.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Die akute Thrombose der Portalvene (PV) und/oder der 
Mesenterialvene(n) (MV) ist eine seltene, jedoch potenziell lebensbedrohliche 
Erkrankung. Eine Vielzahl von Risikofaktoren wie Leberzirrhose, maligne Tumoren, 
Gerinnungsstörungen, intraabdominelle Infektionen/Entzündungen und 
postoperativer Zustand konnte mit der akuten 
Portalvenen-/Mesenterialvenenthrombose (PVT/MVT) in Zusammenhang gebracht 
werden.
METHODEN: In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Behandlungsoptionen bei akuter 
PVT/MVT analysiert.
ERGEBNISSE: Das Management der akuten PVT/MVT sollte zunächst Patienten 
identifizieren, die aufgrund eines intraabdominellen Fokus eine umgehende 
chirurgische Therapie benötigen (z.B. Darmischämie). Ziel der weiteren 
Behandlung sollte dann eine Rekanalisation der PV/MV oder zumindest eine 
Verhinderung der Thromboseausbreitung sein, um Langzeitkomplikationen der 
portalen Hypertonie zu verhindern. Verschiedene therapeutische Optionen, z.B. 
die therapeutische Antikoagulation, lokale/systemische Lyse, interventionelle 
oder chirurgische Thrombektomie, bzw. deren Kombination stehen zur Verfügung. 
Aufgrund fehlender prospektiv-randomisierter Studien ist jedoch ein Vergleich 
hinsichtlich der Effektivität der einzelnen Therapieverfahren schwierig, wenn 
nicht gar unmöglich.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Eine individualisierte Therapie unter Berücksichtigung des 
klinischen Erscheinungsbilds, der zugrunde liegenden Erkrankung, der Ausdehnung 
der Thrombose und der Komorbiditäten des Patienten ist aus unserer Sicht dennoch 
erforderlich. Daher sollten Patienten mit akuter PVT/MVT einer 
interdisziplinären Behandlung an spezialisierten Zentren, die alle derzeit 
vorhandenen Therapieoptionen anbieten können, zugeführt werden.

The epidemiological feedbacks critical to the evolution of host immunity.

Campus, Penryn, UK.

We examine in detail how epidemiological feedbacks combine with costs and 
benefits to determine the evolution of resistance by systematically analysing 
continuously stable strategies (CSS) for different host-parasite frameworks. The 
mode of resistance (innate versus acquired), the nature of the host (i.e. 
life-history and immunological memory) and the nature of the disease (effects on 
fertility or mortality) all impact on the feedbacks that are critical to the 
evolution of resistance. By identifying relationships between CSS investment and 
the underlying epidemiological feedback for each mode of resistance in each 
framework, we distil complex feedbacks into simple combinations of selection 
pressures. When the parasite does not affect fertility, CSS investment reflects 
only the benefit of resistance and we explain why this is markedly different for 
innate and acquired resistance. If infection has no effect on host fertility, 
CSS investment in acquired immunity increases with the square of disease 
prevalence. While in contrast for evolving innate resistance, CSS investment is 
greatest at intermediate prevalence. When disease impacts fertility, only a 
fraction of the host population reproduce, and this introduces new ecological 
feedbacks to both the cost of resistance and the damage from infection. The 
multiple feedbacks in this case lead to the alternative result that the higher 
the abundance of infecteds, the higher the investment in innate resistance. A 
key insight is that maximal investment occurs at intermediate lifespans in a 
range of different host-parasite interactions, but for disparate reasons which 
can only be understood by a detailed analysis of the feedbacks. We discuss the 
extension of our approach to structured host populations and parasite community 
dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is well-documented worldwide among medical 
and dental students. Few studies have assessed the impact of self-development 
coaching programs on the students' psychological health. The aim of the study 
was to evaluate the effect of a self-development coaching programme on the 
psychological health and academic performance of preclinical medical and dental 
students at Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: Four-hundred and twenty-two participants (n = 422, 20-22 years) 
fulfilled the study requirements and were invited into a parallel-randomised 
controlled trial that was partially blinded. Participants were stratified by 
faculty, gender, and academic year, and then randomised. A total of 156 students 
participated in the intervention group (IG) and 163 students participated in the 
control group (CG). The IG received the selfdevelopment programme, involving 
skills and strategies aimed to improve students' psychological health and 
academic performance, through a two-day workshop. Meanwhile, the CG attended an 
active placebo programme focussing on theoretical information that was delivered 
through a five-hour workshop. Both programmes were conducted by the same 
presenter during Week 1 of the second semester of the 2012-2013 academic year. 
Data were gathered immediately before (T1), one week after (T2) and five weeks 
(T3) after the intervention. Psychological health was measured using the 
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the General Self-Efficacy (GSE), and 
the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Academic performance was measured using 
students' academic weighted grades (WG). Student cognitive and emotional 
perceptions of the intervention were measured using the Credibility/Expectancy 
Questionnaire (CEQ).
RESULTS: Data from 317 students, who completed the follow ups, were analysed 
across the three time periods (IG, n = 155; CG, n = 162). The baseline variables 
and demographic data of the IG and CG were not significantly different. The IG 
showed short-term significant reductions in depression and anxiety in compared 
to CG from T1 to T2. The short-term changes in stress, GSE and SWLS of the IG 
were not significantly different from those of the CG. While both groups showed 
a significant change on most of the psychological variables from T1 to T3, no 
significant differences were found between the groups in this period. In 
addition, no significant difference was found in WG between the IG and CG after 
the intervention. No harms relevant to the intervention were reported.
CONCLUSION: The investigated self-development coaching programme showed only a 
short-term improvement on depression and anxiety compared with an active 
control. There was no effect of the intervention on academic performance.

Armed conflict is frequently assumed to be a contributor to the global HIV 
epidemic, but existing evidence is sparse. We examined the relationship between 
armed conflict between 2002 and 2008 and HIV disability life years (DALYs) in 
2010 among WHO Member States. Using partial least squares analysis we also 
examined moderation of the armed conflict-HIV link by two susceptibility 
constructs (background risk, substance use) and one vulnerability mediator 
(numbers of refugees, people on ART, and total HIV spending). Background risk 
directly impacted HIV DALYs (p < 0.05), substance use moderated the conflict-HIV 
relationship (p < 0.01). The vulnerability construct mediated the conflict-HIV 
association (p < 0.01). Findings underscore the need to align HIV 
prevention/intervention efforts with pre-existing HIV burden and reduce the 
impact of natural disasters on the populace in conflict-affected states. 
Integration of substance prevention/harm reduction programs within national HIV 
responses, attention to most-at-risk populations and increased 
surveillance/treatment of drug resistant HIV and TB is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Demoralization is a syndrome of existential distress characterized 
by loss of meaning and purpose in life, hopelessness, and helplessness. 
Empirical data on its occurrence and associated factors in terminally ill 
patients is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to determine the frequency of demoralization 
and its association with individual and disease-related characteristics and to 
analyze the association between demoralization and the preference to discuss 
expected survival.
METHODS: We recruited N = 55 terminally ill cancer patients (54% women, mean age 
67 years) within 48 hours after admission to a specialized palliative care 
inpatient ward (55% had a Karnofsky performance status of ≤50). Patients 
completed the Demoralization Scale (DS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
Scale-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and a single-item 
question measuring preferences for discussion of expected survival with a 
physician.
RESULTS: We found clinically significant demoralization present in 19% and 
moderate demoralization present in 10% of participants. Better educated patients 
reported a higher level of demoralization (d = 0.74, p = .010). Patients with a 
preference to discuss expected survival reported higher levels in the "loss of 
meaning and purpose" dimension of demoralization (d = 0.76, p = .010) and higher 
levels of anxiety (d = 0.88, p = .003) compared to those not wanting to discuss 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Demoralization is a significant dimension of distress in terminally 
ill cancer patients. In the end-of-life inpatient care setting, the preference 
to discuss expected survival with a physician can parallel existential distress 
and anxiety. Further elucidation of patients' underlying existential needs will 
inform interventions that sustain meaning and hope in face of a limited life 
expectancy.

Natural History and Management of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms: 
Current Evidence.

BACKGROUND: With the use of modern cross-sectional abdominal imaging modalities, 
an increasing number of cystic pancreatic lesions are identified incidentally. 
Although there is no pathological diagnosis available in most cases, it is 
believed that the majority of these lesions display small branch-duct 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) of the pancreas. Even though 
a number of large clinical series have been published, many uncertainties remain 
with regard to this entity of mucinous cystic neoplasms.
METHODS: Systematic literature review.
RESULTS: Main-duct (MD) and mixed-type IPMNs harbor a high risk of malignant 
transformation. It is conceivable that most IPMNs with involvement of the main 
duct tend to progress to invasive carcinoma over time. Thus, formal oncologic 
resection is the treatment of choice in surgically fit patients. In contrast, 
the data regarding BD-IPMN remain equivocal, resulting in conflicting concepts. 
To date, it is not clear whether and which BD-IPMNs progress to carcinoma and 
how long this progression takes.
CONCLUSION: While patients with MD-IPMNs should undergo surgical resection if 
comorbidities and life expectancy permit this, the management of small BD-IPMNs 
remains controversial. Population-based studies with long-term follow-up are 
needed to define which cohort of patients can be observed safely without 
immediate resection.

BACKGROUND: To compare thermoplastic masks (TMP) and vacuum cushion system (VCS) 
to assess differences in interfraction set up accuracy in patients treated with 
stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic lung cancer. Secondarily, 
to survey radiotherapy technologists to assess their satisfaction with the two 
systems.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients treated with lung SBRT between 2008 to 
2012 at our institution. Immobilization was performed for 73 treatment sessions 
(VCS = 40; TMP = 33). A total of 246 cone-beams were analysed. Patients 
considered ineligible for surgery with a life expectancy ≥6 months and 
performance status > 1 were included. Target lesion location was verified by 
cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) prior to each session, with displacements 
assessed by CBCT simulation prior to each treatment session. Couch shifts were 
registered prospectively in vertical, longitudinal, and latero-lateral 
directions to obtain Kernel coordinates (3D representation). Technologists were 
surveyed to assess their satisfaction with indexing, positioning, and learning 
curve of the two systems. Setup displacements were obtained in all patients for 
each treatment plan and for each session. To assess differences between the 
immobilization systems, a t-test (Welch) was performed.
RESULTS: Mean displacements for the TMP and VC systems, respectively, were as 
follows: session one, 0.64 cm vs 1.05 cm (p = 0.0002); session two, 0.49 cm vs 
1.02 cm (p < 0.0001), and session three, 0.56 vs 0.97 cm (p = 0.0011). TMP 
resulted in significantly smaller shifts vs. VCS in all three treatment 
sessions. Technologists rated the learning curve, set up, and positioning more 
highly for TMP versus VCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high doses and steep gradients in lung SBRT, accurate 
and reproducible inter-fraction set up is essential. We found that thermoplastic 
masks offers better reproducibility with significantly less interfractional set 
up displacement than vacuum cushions. Moreover, radiotherapy technologists rated 
the TMP system higher. Taken together, these two findings suggest that TMP may 
be preferable to VCS. However, more research is needed to determine both inter- 
and intrafraction error to identify the optimal immobilisation system for use in 
lung SBRT.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate educational differentials in health expectancy among 
50-year-old Danes before and during the financial crisis.
METHODS: Nationwide register data on mortality were combined with data from 
SHARE surveys in 2006/2007 and 2010/2011 to estimate disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) and expected lifetime in self-rated good health by educational 
level.
RESULTS: The difference in life expectancy between 50-year-old men and women 
with high and low educational levels increased by 0.3 and 0.8 years, 
respectively. The overall educational differentials in DFLE did not change much 
for women, whereas for men the tendency was that DFLE increased for those with 
high educational level and decreased for those with less education ascending the 
difference by almost 2 years (from 5.9 to 7.8 years), although the difference 
was not statistically significant. The educational disparity in expected 
lifetime in self-rated good health increased by 1.3 years for men and 1.2 years 
for women.
CONCLUSIONS: The social inequality in DFLE for men and expected lifetime in 
self-rated good health for both genders increased slightly during the short 
period. The financial crisis did not seem to indicate a change in the persistent 
trend of the widening social gap.

Several studies have sought to determine the monetary value of health gains 
expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, predominantly using 
willingness to pay approaches. However, willingness to pay has a number of 
recognized problems, most notably its insensitivity to scope. This paper 
presents an alternative approach to estimate the monetary value of a QALY, which 
is based on the time trade-off method. Moreover, it presents the results of an 
online study conducted in the Netherlands exploring the feasibility of this 
novel approach. The results seem promising, but also highlight a number of 
methodological problems with this approach, most notably nontrading and the 
elicitation of negative values. Additional research is necessary to try to 
overcome these problems and to determine the potential of this new approach.

BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding the cardiovascular disease epidemic, current 
budgetary constraints do not allow for budget expansion of conventional cardiac 
rehabilitation programmes. Consequently, there is an increasing need for 
cost-effectiveness studies of alternative strategies such as telerehabilitation. 
The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive cardiac 
telerehabilitation programme.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This multi-centre randomized controlled trial comprised 140 
cardiac rehabilitation patients, randomized (1:1) to a 24-week 
telerehabilitation programme in addition to conventional cardiac rehabilitation 
(intervention group) or to conventional cardiac rehabilitation alone (control 
group). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on 
intervention and health care costs (incremental cost), and the differential 
incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: The total average cost per patient was significantly lower in the 
intervention group (€2156 ± €126) than in the control group (€2720 ± €276) 
(p = 0.01) with an overall incremental cost of €-564.40. Dividing this 
incremental cost by the baseline adjusted differential incremental QALYs (0.026 
QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €-21,707/QALY. The 
number of days lost due to cardiovascular rehospitalizations in the intervention 
group (0.33 ± 0.15) was significantly lower than in the control group 
(0.79 ± 0.20) (p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the addition of cardiac telerehabilitation to 
conventional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation to be more effective and 
efficient than centre-based cardiac rehabilitation alone. These results are 
useful for policy makers charged with deciding how limited health care resources 
should best be allocated in the era of exploding need.

The cost-effectiveness of novel direct acting antiviral agent therapies for the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

In the USA, over 3 million individuals are infected with the HCV and 75-85% of 
them have or will develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC) which can lead to serious 
consequences such as liver cirrhosis, cancer and death. The old standard of care 
for the treatment of CHC was Pegylated-Interferon + Ribavirin with or without a 
protease inhibitor such as Boceprevir/Telaprevir. These treatments had a cure 
rate or rate of sustained virologic response of 66-80%. Since the close of 2013, 
several new direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for the treatment of CHC have 
been approved by the US FDA and have entered the US drug market. These novel CHC 
treatments boast very high cure rates of 80-100% and come with matching high 
price tags. Costs of CHC regimens that contain these novel DAAs range from 
$63,000 to $168,000 per treatment course. Using electronic databases, studies 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of novel CHC treatments in USA were reviewed, 
and the reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on cost per 
additional quality adjusted life year gained from the studies reviewed indicated 
that some novel DAA regimens are cost-effective; however, cost-effectiveness is 
contingent upon a variety of factors such as HCV genotype (1-4), presence of 
liver cirrhosis, patient treatment history and willingness-to-pay thresholds.
