BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the prevalence of 
self-reported chronic non-communicable diseases and their correlates in 
Botswana. This is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of respondents aged 10-64 years using 
data from the Botswana AIDS Impact Survey IV conducted in 2013. Three 
self-reported non-communicable diseases, namely, hypertension, diabetes and 
asthma were used. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify 
their correlates.
RESULTS: Out of the 2153 participants, the prevalence rates of hypertension, 
diabetes and asthma were 14.2%, 3.3% and 5.3%, respectively. The study found 
that among other factors, older populations are at a much higher risk of having 
more than one non-communicable disease. After controlling for other covariates, 
the ORs of self-reported non-communicable disease was highest among older 
respondents aged 50 years and over (AOR=12.01, p<0.001) followed by richer 
respondents (AOR=1.86, p≤0.025). The ORs were also higher among females 
(AOR=1.83, p<0.001) and urban village residents (AOR=1.41, p=0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that chronic non-communicable diseases are likely to 
increase in the future due to the rise in the old age population resulting from 
fertility transition and improvement in life expectancy in Botswana. Therefore 
urgent and holistic intervention programmes are required to halt the problem. 
Failure to act now is likely to result in high morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Improper antibiotic use is one of the main drivers of bacterial 
resistance to antibiotics, increasing infectious diseases morbidity and 
mortality and raising costs of healthcare. The level of antibiotic consumption 
has been shown to vary according to socioeconomic determinants (SED) such as 
income and access to education. In many Latin American countries, antibiotics 
could be easily purchased without a medical prescription in private pharmacies 
before enforcement of restrictions on over-the-counter (OTC) sales in recent 
years. Brazil issued a law abolishing OTC sales in October 2010. This study 
seeks to find SED of antibiotic consumption in the Brazilian state of São Paulo 
(SSP) and to estimate the impact of the 2010 law.
METHODS: Data on all oral antibiotic sales having occurred in the private sector 
in SSP from 2008 to 2012 were pooled into the 645 municipalities of SSP. Linear 
regression was performed to estimate consumption levels that would have occurred 
in 2011 and 2012 if no law regulating OTC sales had been issued in 2010. These 
values were compared to actual observed levels, estimating the effect of this 
law. Linear regression was performed to find association of antibiotic 
consumption levels and of a greater effect of the law with municipality level 
data on SED obtained from a nationwide census.
RESULTS: Oral antibiotic consumption in SSP rose from 8.44 defined daily doses 
per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID) in 2008 to 9.95 in 2010, and fell to 8.06 
DID in 2012. Determinants of a higher consumption were higher human development 
index, percentage of urban population, density of private health establishments, 
life expectancy and percentage of females; lower illiteracy levels and lower 
percentage of population between 5 and 15 years old. A higher percentage of 
females was associated with a stronger effect of the law.
CONCLUSIONS: SSP had similar antibiotic consumption levels as the whole country 
of Brazil, and they were effectively reduced by the policy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The average human life expectancy is increasing worldwide, 
thus the proportion of elderly gastric cancer patients is also increasing. In 
this case-control study, we investigated the clinical and oncologic outcomes of 
gastric cancer in patients over 80 years old.
METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2010, 291 patients aged over 80 years old 
(case group) were diagnosed and treated with gastric cancer at Asan Medical 
Center, Seoul, Korea. From the same period, 291 patients aged 18 to 80 years old 
were selected as the control group. The clinical findings and clinical outcomes 
of gastric cancer were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the two 
groups.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in the overall 5-year survival rate 
between the case and control groups (30.9% vs. 73.8%, respectively; P<0.001). In 
patients who received the curative treatment, overall 3- and 5-year survival 
rates showed 74.3% and 57.9% in case group and 91.6% and 86.5% in the control 
group. When analysis was confined to resectable elderly patients with a 
favorable performance, the curative resection group showed significantly better 
overall 3- and 5-year survival rates than the conservative treatment group 
(73.7% and 58.8% vs. 29.8% and 0%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Although elderly gastric cancer patients show an advanced stage at 
diagnosis and poor prognosis compared with non-elderly patients, elderly 
patients with good performance could benefit from curative resection. Thus, the 
clinical decision whether to undergo curative resection or conservative 
management should be made on an individualized basis.

[Purpose] To evaluate the effect of a home exercise program on physical function 
in community dwelling elderly with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia. [Subjects and 
Methods] Fifty-two community-dwelling individuals, over 60 years and meeting the 
diagnostic criteria for pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia, were randomly assigned to 
intervention group (n=34) and control group (n=18). The intervention group 
completed 6-months home exercise programs, combining walking with lower limb 
resistance exercises. Body mass index, skeletal mass index, body fat percentage, 
handgrip strength, single-leg standing, walking speed (comfortable and maximal), 
and knee extension strength were evaluated at baseline and post-intervention. 
Activity was assessed using the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Functional 
Scale (GLFS-25) and quality of life using the Euro QOL questionnaire. [Results] 
Pre- and post-training assessments were completed by 76.5% and 77.8% of 
participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The 
intervention improved single-leg standing (60.5 s to 77.2 s) and knee extension 
strength (1.38 Nm/kg to 1.69 Nm/kg). In the control group, maximum walking speed 
(2.02 m/s to 1.86 m/s) and GLFS-25 score (2.9 to 5.1) worsened. Change of 
pre-sarcopenia/sarcopenia status was comparable for the intervention (15.4%) and 
control (14.3%) groups. [Conclusion] A 6-month home exercise program improved 
physical function in community-dwelling individuals with pre-sarcopenia or 
sarcopenia.

Predictive modelling in drug discovery is challenging to automate as it often 
contains multiple analysis steps and might involve cross-validation and 
parameter tuning that create complex dependencies between tasks. With 
large-scale data or when using computationally demanding modelling methods, 
e-infrastructures such as high-performance or cloud computing are required, 
adding to the existing challenges of fault-tolerant automation. Workflow 
management systems can aid in many of these challenges, but the currently 
available systems are lacking in the functionality needed to enable agile and 
flexible predictive modelling. We here present an approach inspired by elements 
of the flow-based programming paradigm, implemented as an extension of the Luigi 
system which we name SciLuigi. We also discuss the experiences from using the 
approach when modelling a large set of biochemical interactions using a shared 
computer cluster.Graphical abstract.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during tracheal intubation 
is a life-threatening complication in emergency patients. Rapid sequence 
intubation is commonly performed to prevent aspiration but is not associated 
with low risk of intubation related complications. Although it has been 
considered that aspiration can be prevented in the lateral position, few studies 
have evaluated the ability to prevent aspiration. Moreover, this position is not 
always a favorable position for tracheal intubation. If aspiration can be 
prevented in a clinically relevant semi-lateral position, it may be 
advantageous. We assessed the ability to prevent aspiration in the lateral 
position and various degrees of the semi-lateral position using a 
vomiting-regurgitation manikin model.
METHODS: A manikin's head was placed in the neutral, simple extension, or 
sniffing position. The amount of aspirated saline into the bronchi during 
simulated vomiting was measured at semi-lateral position angles of 0º to 90º in 
10º increments. The difference in the vertical height between the mouth corner 
and the inferior border of the vocal cord was measured radiologically at each 
semi-lateral position in the three head-neck positions.
RESULTS: Pulmonary aspiration was prevented at the ≥70º, ≥80º, and 90º 
semi-lateral positions in the neutral, simple extension, and sniffing positions, 
respectively. The mouth was lower than the vocal cord in the semi-lateral 
position in which aspiration was prevented.
CONCLUSION: The lateral or excessive semi-lateral position was necessary to 
protect the lung from aspiration in the head-neck positions commonly used for 
tracheal intubation. Prevention of aspiration was difficult within clinically 
relevant semi-lateral positions.

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in octogenarians.

Raja SG(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiac Surgery, Harefield Hospital, London, UK.

Enhanced life expectancy has confronted cardiac surgery with a rapidly growing 
population of octogenarians needing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 
Octogenarians are deemed a high-risk patient population with increased 
postoperative morbidity and mortality following conventional CABG using 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In such patients reducing the invasiveness of the 
surgical procedure by avoiding CPB may be tried in an attempt to improve 
outcomes. The increasing performance of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) 
grafting within certain centers reflects surgeon preference to avoid the 
inherent risks of CPB and cardioplegic arrest including hemodilution, 
nonpulsatile arterial flow, global myocardial ischemia, atherosclerotic 
embolization from aortic manipulation, and systemic inflammatory response. 
Although OPCAB grafting is a well-established surgical myocardial 
revascularization strategy, its actual benefits in terms of morbidity and 
mortality remain questionable in the general population. In the higher risk 
octogenarian patients, however, there is a potential for more tangible clinical 
benefits when CPB is avoided. This review article provides an overview of the 
impact of OPCAB grafting on postoperative mortality and morbidity in 
octogenarians.

Mast cell clonal disorders are characterized by the clonal proliferation of 
pathological mast cells as a result of somatic mutations in the KIT gene, most 
commonly the D816V mutation. Accumulation and degranulation of these cells 
causes a wide variety of symptoms. Mast cell clonal disorders can be divided 
into mastocytosis and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome, depending of the 
level of clonality. The severity of mastocytosis varies from an indolent variant 
with a good prognosis, to an aggressive condition with short life expectancy. 
Diagnosis is based on demonstration of clonality and accumulation in the skin 
and in extracutaneous tissues. Treatment is highly individualized, and is based 
on the severity of the condition. Treatment of patients with indolent systemic 
mastocytosis is aimed at reducing symptoms, using histamine H1 and H2 receptor 
antagonists as a starting point. In addition, associated conditions such as 
osteoporosis must be treated. Treatment of advanced systemic mastocytosis is 
aimed at reducing mast cell load through cytoreductive therapy. The choice of 
such therapy depends on the KIT mutational status. Though currently there is no 
curative treatment available, promising new therapies such as midostaurin are 
emerging that have demonstrated success in reducing symptoms and improving 
quality of life.

Technologies for Prolonging Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Longevity.

Lau EW(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, UK.

Prolonged longevity of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is needed 
not only as a passive response to match the prolonging life expectancy of 
patient recipients, but will also actively prolong their life expectancy by 
avoiding/deferring the risks (and costs) associated with device replacement. 
CIEDs are still exclusively powered by nonrechargeable primary batteries, and 
energy exhaustion is the dominant and an inevitable cause of device replacement. 
The longevity of a CIED is thus determined by the attrition rate of its finite 
energy reserve. The energy available from a battery depends on its capacity 
(total amount of electric charge), chemistry (anode, cathode, and electrolyte), 
and internal architecture (stacked plate, folded plate, and spiral wound). The 
energy uses of a CIED vary and include a background current for running 
electronic circuitry, periodic radiofrequency telemetry, high-voltage capacitor 
reformation, constant ventricular pacing, and sporadic shocks for the cardiac 
resynchronization therapy defibrillators. The energy use by a CIED is primarily 
determined by the patient recipient's clinical needs, but the energy stored in 
the device battery is entirely under the manufacturer's control. A larger 
battery capacity generally results in a longer-lasting device, but improved 
battery chemistry and architecture may allow more space-efficient designs. Armed 
with the necessary technical knowledge, healthcare professionals and purchasers 
will be empowered to make judicious selection on device models and maximize the 
utilization of all their energy-saving features, to prolong device longevity for 
the benefits of their patients and healthcare systems.

AIM: To increase the knowledge of the frequency and intensity of symptoms and 
the treatment interventions in older palliative cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: Research on symptoms and the treatment modalities in older 
palliative cancer patients is scarce. Insight into these aspects is needed to 
enable healthcare professionals to alleviate the burden.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Four hundred hospitalized older palliative cancer patients participated 
in the study between March 2013 - February 2015. Two validated instruments were 
used to assess 40 symptoms in multiple domains and collect data on the treatment 
modalities in older palliative cancer patients.
RESULTS: Patients reported on average approximately 14 symptoms. Dry mouth, 
physical fatigue, lack of energy, lack of appetite and difficulty moving outside 
were the most prevalent. Psychological pain, psychological fatigue, lack of 
willpower, lack of energy and physical fatigue were reported as intensive. On 
average, 5·15 disciplines were consulted per patient. Few patients were referred 
to a palliative support team, spiritual consultant or psychologist. Patients 
received a variety of interventions to increase life expectancy and alleviate 
symptoms and the side effects of treatment. The occurrence of symptoms was 
associated with different clinical and treatment variables such as having a 
geriatric risk profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients receiving palliative cancer care are confronted with 
multiple symptoms. Psychological symptoms are more often reported as intensive. 
Greater attention should be given to the early referral of patients to 
palliative care teams, assessment and management of multiple symptoms, 
particularly psychological symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: Applying prospect theory to end-of-life decision making, we 
hypothesize that community-dwelling older adults (CDOAs) will be relatively less 
inclined towards extending length over improving quality of life compared with 
patients. We also hypothesize that differences in relative inclination for 
length over quality of life between the 2 groups will decrease with advancing 
age.
METHODS: We tested these hypotheses by administering the quality-quantity 
questionnaire to 1067 CDOAs and 320 stage IV cancer patients and applying a 
linear regression model to assess whether relative inclination for length over 
quality of life, as estimated by the questionnaire, differed between CDOAs and 
patients after controlling for differences in sociodemographic characteristics. 
We also assessed the effect of interaction between age and participant status 
(CDOA compared to patient) on relative inclination for length over quality of 
life.
RESULTS: Consistent with prospect theory, a lower proportion of CDOAs (26%) than 
patients (42%) were relatively more inclined towards length over quality of 
life. Results were significant even after adjusting for differences in 
sociodemographics (P < .01). With increasing age, the difference in relative 
inclination between CDOAs and patients increased (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that attitudes towards length and quality of life 
differ by life stage. This has implications for end-of-life care decisions made 
by CDOAs, such as purchasing health or disability insurance and signing advance 
directives or care plans.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been undertreated among elderly 
patients. Interferon-free treatment represents an opportunity for these 
patients. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of directly 
acting antivirals (DAAs) in CHC elderly patients.
METHODS: A Markov model of CHC natural history was built. This study focuses on 
CHC patients older than 65 years, stratified according to genotype (1/4, 2 and 
3), liver fibrosis (METAVIR F1 to F4), age and frailty phenotype (robust, 
pre-frail and frail). DAAs combination vs no treatment was simulated for each 
theoretical population, assessing life years, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in a lifetime time 
horizon and by the Healthcare System perspective.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with age and frailty 
status in all fibrosis stages. For robust F3 and F4 patients ICERs remained 
below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of 40 000€/QALY up to age 75 and 
86 years, respectively, depending on drug price and sustained virological 
response probability (sensitivity analysis). Notably, in F4 and frail subjects 
older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality 
rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years 
old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of DAAs treatment of elderly CHC patients is 
solid in those with advanced fibrosis, but it depends strongly on frailty status 
and age, particularly in patients with milder fibrosis stages. Accurate 
assessment of clinical variables, including frailty, is necessary to allocate 
limited resources to this special population.

Comment in
    Lancet HIV. 2017 Mar;4(3):e95-e96.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) substantially decreases morbidity and 
mortality in people living with HIV. In this study, we describe population-level 
trends in the adult life expectancy and trends in the residual burden of HIV 
mortality after the roll-out of a public sector ART programme in KwaZulu-Natal, 
South Africa, one of the populations with the most severe HIV epidemics in the 
world.
METHODS: Data come from the Africa Centre Demographic Information System 
(ACDIS), an observational community cohort study in the uMkhanyakude district in 
northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We used non-parametric survival analysis 
methods to estimate gains in the population-wide life expectancy at age 15 years 
since the introduction of ART, and the shortfall of the population-wide adult 
life expectancy compared with that of the HIV-negative population (ie, the life 
expectancy deficit). Life expectancy gains and deficits were further 
disaggregated by age and cause of death with demographic decomposition methods.
FINDINGS: Covering the calendar years 2001 through to 2014, we obtained 
information on 93 903 adults who jointly contribute 535 42 8 person-years of 
observation to the analyses and 9992 deaths. Since the roll-out of ART in 2004, 
adult life expectancy increased by 15·2 years for men (95% CI 12·4-17·8) and 
17·2 years for women (14·5-20·2). Reductions in pulmonary tuberculosis and 
HIV-related mortality account for 79·7% of the total life expectancy gains in 
men (8·4 adult life-years), and 90·7% in women (12·8 adult life-years). For men, 
9·5% is the result of a decline in external injuries. By 2014, the life 
expectancy deficit had decreased to 1·2 years for men (-2·9 to 5·8) and to 5·3 
years for women (2·6-7·8). In 2011-14, pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV were 
responsible for 84·9% of the life expectancy deficit in men and 80·8% in women.
INTERPRETATION: The burden of HIV on adult mortality in this population is 
rapidly shrinking, but remains large for women, despite their better engagement 
with HIV-care services. Gains in adult life-years lived as well as the present 
life expectancy deficit are almost exclusively due to differences in mortality 
attributed to HIV and pulmonary tuberculosis.

A 68-year-old man was diagnosed as having advanced gastric cancer. Computed 
tomography showed a thyroid tumor with trachea deviation. This tumor exhibited 
mosaic echogenecity in ultrasonography. Signet-ring cell carcinoma was found by 
means of fine needle aspiration biopsy. This tumor gradually became swollen and 
the thyroid hormone levels in blood were increased without any clinical symptom. 
Shortly, he died from his illness in the 29th hospital day. Autopsy disclosed 
that the left lobe of the thyroid gland was highly invaded by malignant cells 
and that lymphogenic rather than angiogenic metastasis was highly probable. 
Thyroid metastasis of gastric cancer is extremely rare. The prognosis is very 
poor. Ultrasonography is a very useful modality especially when coupled with 
recently developed fine needle aspiration biopsy in differential diagnosis of 
thyroid tumors once malignancy is suspected. Therapeutic strategy largely 
depends on the nature of primary malignant tumor. If the tumor is slowly 
progressive such as renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer, extirpation of 
thyroid tumors may extend life expectancy. In conclusion, the metastatic thyroid 
tumor of gastric cancer is rare and shows poor prognosis. Fine needle aspiration 
biopsy under ultrasonography is strongly recommended as a useful diagnostic 
tool.

Over the past decade, catheter ablation has emerged as an important therapeutic 
option and reserved for drug refractory symptomatic paroxysmal and persistent 
atrial fibrillation (AF). Although elderly population constitutes the 
significant amount of AF patients, literature data is inadequate regarding the 
use of catheter ablation for elderly AF patients. Since there has been 
significant improvement in efficacy and safety of the AF ablation in last 
decade, it has become widespread accross the whole world. As the life expectancy 
continues to grow in population and outcomes of catheter ablation for AF further 
improve, higher number of elderly patients are likely to undergo catheter 
ablation for AF. Therefore, in this paper we reviewed the published literature 
to date regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of catheter ablation for AF 
in elderly patients.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy at birth (LEB) is closely associated with the 
degree of economic and social development in developed and developing countries. 
This study aimed to examine the socioeconomic factors affecting LEB in Iran from 
1985 to 2013.
METHODS: Time series analysis was used to examine the effects of key explanatory 
factors (GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, degree of 
urbanization, food availability, CO2 emission, total fertility rate, inflation 
rate, and literacy rate) on LEB in Iran from 1985 to 2013. Study data were 
retrieved from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Iranian Statistical Center (ISC), 
and World Bank. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Banergy, Dolado, and Master 
(BDM) tests, Engle Granger approach, and an ordinary least-square (OLS) model 
were used to achieve the aim of the study. Data analysis was performed by Stata 
V.12 software.
RESULTS: Our findings indicated that GDP per capita (p=0.003), number of doctors 
per 10,000 population (p=0.036), literacy rate (p=0.0001), and food availability 
(p=0.0001) have a positive and significant statistically effect on LEB. The 
relationship between total fertility rate and LEB was negative and significant 
(p=0.023). In addition, the effect of degree urbanization (p=0.811), CO2 
emission (p=0.185), and inflation rate (p=0.579) on LEB were not significant.
CONCLUSION: GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, food 
availability, literacy rate, and total fertility were identified as the main 
factors affecting life expectancy in Iran. The study, however, suggests that 
life expectancy in Iran could be improved if attention is given to factors that 
reside outside of the health sector.

We report a case of buccal abscess caused by an impacted wisdom tooth in an 
extremely elderly person with malnutrition. The patient was a 94-year-old man, 
who complained that he had found it hard to open his mouth and that his cheek 
had been swollen for the previous 2 weeks. He had a shallow oral wound caused by 
an improperly fitting denture; however, the wound became infected. We performed 
incisional drainage of the abscess under local anesthesia. The swelling 
disappeared and he was able to open his mouth 55 mm. The elderly have a high 
risk of healing failure of injuries and it has been reported that infection in a 
host in a compromised state is severely intractable. This elderly patient was in 
a compromised state because of malnutrition. Cases such as this one will 
increase as the elderly population increases. Dentists need to consider the 
quality of life of patients with a longer life expectancy and should offer 
patients several treatment options before their general condition deteriorates.

Chlamydia trachomatis infections during pregnancy may have serious consequences 
for women and their offspring. Chlamydial infections are largely asymptomatic. 
Hence, prevention is based on screening. The objective of this study was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of C. trachomatis screening during pregnancy. We 
used a health-economic decision analysis model, which included potential health 
outcomes of C. trachomatis infection for women, partners and infants, and 
premature delivery. We estimated the cost-effectiveness from a societal 
perspective using recent prevalence data from a population-based prospective 
cohort study among pregnant women in the Netherlands. We calculated the averted 
costs by linking health outcomes with health care costs and productivity losses. 
Cost-effectiveness was expressed as net costs per major outcome prevented and 
was estimated in base-case analysis, sensitivity, and scenario analysis. In the 
base-case analysis, the costs to detect 1000 pregnant women with C. trachomatis 
were estimated at €527,900. Prevention of adverse health outcomes averted 
€626,800 in medical costs, resulting in net cost savings. Sensitivity analysis 
showed that net cost savings remained with test costs up to €22 (test price €19) 
for a broad range of variation in underlying assumptions. Scenario analysis 
showed even more cost savings with targeted screening for women less than 
30 years of age or with first pregnancies only. Antenatal screening for C. 
trachomatis is a cost-saving intervention when testing all pregnant women in the 
Netherlands. Savings increase even further when testing women younger than 
30 years of age or with pregnancies only.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to clarify both systemic and local prognosis 
after surgical interventions for critical limb ischemia (CLI) due to vasculitis 
or connective tissue related disease, and to search for any risk factors that 
can worsen the prognosis.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety three patients that underwent surgical 
interventions for CLI between 2005 and 2014 were followed up for a median of 2.7 
years. The patients were grouped into a group with vasculitis or connective 
tissue related disease (V) or with atherosclerosis (control: C). Two groups were 
retrospectively reviewed and compared.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were grouped into the V group. At three years after 
intervention, V group showed significantly higher survival rate compared to C 
group (89% vs. 73%). On the other hand, limb survival rate after bypass surgery 
was significantly lower (74% vs. 94%), due to lower patency of the bypassed 
graft. Within V group, preoperative skin perfusion pressure of lower than 20 
mmHg showed significantly worse prognosis of the limb. (HR 1.8; P=0.01) 
Regarding specific diseases, systemic scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus tended to show worse prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLI due to vasculitis or connective tissue related 
disease have a longer life expectancy with lower limb salvage rate that can lead 
to low quality of the remaining life.

E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed on the luminal surface of inflamed 
blood vessels that mediates hematogenous metastasis by assisting shear-resistant 
adhesion of circulating tumor cells to the vessel surface under dynamic blood 
flow. Previously, we developed an E-selectin antagonistic thioaptamer (ESTA) for 
the prevention of hematogenous metastasis through the blockade of CD44high 
breast cancer cells (BCa) adhesion to E-selectin-expressing premetastatic 
endothelial niche. The current study focuses on developing a PEGylated 
E-selectin targeting thioaptamer with improved pharmaceutical properties. A 
serial deletion of stem-loops reveled that loop-1 and -2 (ESTA7) are the 
minimally effective backbone structure necessary to obtain inhibition of the 
E-selectin/CD44 interaction and shear resistant adhesion of CD44high BCa to 
E-selectin-expressing human endothelial cells (HMVECs) at a level equal to ESTA. 
Chemical conjugation of methoxy-polyethylene-glycol (PEG) at the sizes of 5 and 
10 kDa did not interfere with ESTA7-mediated shear-resistant adhesion. However, 
in vivo study demonstrated that only 10 kDa PEG-conjugated ESTA7 (ESTA7-p10) 
retains the activity to inhibit metastases at a level equal to parental ESTA. 
Additionally, a single intravenous injection of ESTA7-p10 inhibited the 
development of lung, brain, and bone metastases of MDA-MB-231, through the 
blockade of E-selectin. Moreover, PEGylation led to an extension of elimination 
half-life and increase of AUC, resulting in superior inhibition of metastasis 
development compared to parental ESTA with a longer interval between dosing in a 
spontaneous metastasis model. Lastly, repeated intravenous administration of 
ESTA7-p10 was tolerated in mice, highlighting the potential prophylactic 
application of ESTA7-p10 for metastasis prevention.

The multi‑kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only drug for which randomized 
control trials have shown improved patient survival in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). However, life expectancy is extended in these cases by only a 
few months. The anti‑type II diabetes agent metformin was used in this study in 
an effort to find a more efficient approach to HCC treatment. Sorafenib 
effectively reversed the activation status of mTORC2 induced by metformin and 
enhanced the suppression of the mTORC1 and MAPK pathway by metformin in HCC 
cells, which may be responsible for reduced proliferation upon combined 
treatment. The metformin and sorafenib combination led to increased impaired 
proliferation and tumor inhibition of HCC in vitro and in vivo compared to 
single agent, which was partially bridged by disrupting the mTORC1/mTORC2 
feedback loop. Metformin and sorafenib cooperated to promote apoptosis and 
autophagy in HCC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy sensitized HCC 
cells to metformin and sorefenib‑induced apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the 
anti‑autophagy treatment should be considered in metformin and sorafenib-based 
treatments in HCC cells.

[Hyperuricemia and Gout].

[Article in Italian]

Delbarba E, Terlizzi V, Dallera N, Izzi C, Scolari F.

Already known to ancient Egyptians, gout is one of the first diseases which have 
been described as a clinical entity. To date, gout is the most common form of 
inflammatory arthritis. Gout is defined by the deposition of monosodium urate 
crystals within tissues, causing episodes of acute arthritis and the development 
of tophi, nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. Hyperuricemia, i.e. levels of 
serum uric acid above 6.8 mg / dL(404mol/L), is a condition necessary, yet not 
sufficient for gout to develop. The increasing incidence of risk factors such as 
hypertension, obesity, and renal failure together with an ever-growing life 
expectancy has led in recent decades to a significant increase in gout 
prevalence, which has more than doubled when compared to the 1960s. This article 
addresses the issue of gout by highlighting the role played by the kidneys in 
uric acid homeostasis; the clinical effect of crystal deposition in tissues, 
including the kidney; the more recent guidelines on diagnosis and management 
strategies, with special regard to the use of old and new drugs in renal 
patients.
