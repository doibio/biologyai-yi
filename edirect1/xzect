Cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD) are a major cause of long-term morbidity and 
mortality affecting life expectancy amongst cancer survivors. In recent years, 
because of the possibility of early diagnosis and the increased efficacy of 
neo-adjuvant and adjuvant systemic treatments (targeting specific molecular 
pathways), the high percentage of survival from breast cancer led CVD to become 
the first cause of death among survivors. Therefore, it is mandatory to adopt 
cardioprotective strategies to minimize CV side effects and CVD in general in 
breast cancer patients. Cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) 
is a common group of side effects of chemotherapeutics widely employed in breast 
cancer (e.g., anthracycline and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
inhibitors). The aim of the present manuscript is to propose a pragmatic 
multidisciplinary stepwise approach for prevention, early detection, and 
treatment of cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) is the first therapeutic option 
for elderly patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and indications 
are steadily expanding to younger patients and subjects with lower surgical risk 
and longer life expectancy. Commissural alignment between native and 
transcatheter valves facilitates coronary access after TAVR and is thus 
considered a procedural goal, allowing long-term management of coronary artery 
disease. Moreover, commissural alignment may potentially have a positive impact 
on transvalvular hemodynamic and valve durability. This review focus on 
technical hints to achieve commissural alignment and current evidence for 
different transcatheter aortic valves.

Biological particles, along with inorganic gaseous and particulate pollutants, 
constitute an ever-present component of the atmosphere and surfaces. Among these 
particles are fungal species colonizing almost all ecosystems, including the 
human body. Although inoffensive to most people, fungi can be responsible for 
several health problems, such as allergic fungal diseases and fungal infections. 
Worldwide fungal disease incidence is increasing, with new emerging fungal 
diseases appearing yearly. Reasons for this increase are the expansion of life 
expectancy, the number of immunocompromised patients (immunosuppressive 
treatments for transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiency 
diseases), the number of uncontrolled underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes 
mellitus), and the misusage of medication (e.g., corticosteroids and 
broad-spectrum antibiotics). Managing fungal diseases is challenging; only four 
classes of antifungal drugs are available, resistance to these drugs is 
increasing, and no vaccines have been approved. The present work reviews the 
implications of fungal particles in human health from allergic diseases (i.e., 
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, severe asthma with fungal 
sensitization, thunderstorm asthma, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and 
occupational lung diseases) to infections (i.e., superficial, subcutaneous, and 
systemic infections). Topics such as the etiological agent, risk factors, 
clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment will be revised to improve the 
knowledge of this growing health concern.

Cardiac ventricular outpouchings and invaginations are rare structural 
abnormalities and usually incidental findings during cardiac imaging. A 
definitive diagnosis is possible through the use of multimodality imaging. A 
systematic review of the literature was carried out in November 2022 to identify 
studies regarding ventricular outpouchings and invaginations. The main aim of 
the review is to summarize knowledge regarding epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis 
and prognosis of patients with ventricular outpouchings (aneurisms or 
diverticula) and invaginations (crypts and recesses). Overall, 26 studies 
published between 2000 and 2020 were included in the review. Diverticula and 
congenital aneurysms incidence ranges between 0.6 and 4.1%. Myocardial recesses 
and crypts range between 9% in the general population and up to 25% in patients 
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The combined use of echocardiography, cardiac 
computed tomography (CCT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is useful to 
establish tissue contractility, fibrosis, extension and relationship with 
adjacent structures for differential diagnosis of both invaginations and 
outpouchings. In conclusion, both outpouchings and invaginations are rare 
entities: a definitive diagnosis may be aided by the use of combining multiple 
imaging techniques, and the treatment depends both on the lesion-specific risk 
of complications and on the potential association of some lesions with 
cardiomyopathy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder impacting 
cognition, function, and behavior in the elderly population. While there are 
currently no disease-modifying agents capable of curing AD, early diagnosis and 
management in the preclinical stage can significantly improve patient morbidity 
and life expectancy. Currently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a 
clinical one, often supplemented by invasive and expensive biomarker testing. 
Over the last decade, significant advancements have been made in our 
understanding of AD and the role of ocular tissue as a potential biomarker. 
Ocular biomarkers hold the potential to provide noninvasive and easily 
accessible diagnostic and monitoring capabilities. This review summarizes 
current research for detecting biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in ocular 
tissue.

As life expectancy increases, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in older individuals 
becomes more prevalent. We explored whether late-onset versus earlier-onset PsA 
patients display different clinical features at diagnosis and/or during the 
disease course, as well as different treatment approaches and comorbidity 
profiles. We retrospectively collected data from consecutive PsA patients 
attending two rheumatology centers (December 2017-December 2022). Late-onset PsA 
patients (diagnosis-age: ≥60 years) were compared to those diagnosed before 60 
years old. Univariate analyses and logistic regression were performed to examine 
for factors associated with late-onset PsA. For sensitivity analyses, the 
cohort's mean diagnosis age was used as the cut-off value. Overall, 281 PsA 
patients were included (mean ± SD diagnosis-age: 46.0 ± 13.3 years). Of them, 
14.2% (N = 40) had late-onset PsA. At diagnosis, after controlling for 
confounders, no demographic and clinical differences were identified. During the 
disease course, the late-onset group exhibited 65% fewer odds of manifesting 
enthesitis (adjusted Odds-ratio-adOR 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.97), 
but higher frequency of dyslipidemia (adOR 3.01; 1.30-6.95) and of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (adOR 4.30; 1.42-12.98) compared to earlier-onset PsA 
group. No differences were found in the treatment approaches. In sensitivity 
analyses, PsA patients diagnosed after 46 (vs. ≤46) years old had an increased 
frequency of hypertension (adOR 3.18; 1.70-5.94) and dyslipidemia (adOR 2.17; 
1.25-3.74). The present study underpins that late-onset PsA is not uncommon, 
while the age at PsA onset may affect the longitudinal clinical expression of 
the disease. Patients with late-onset PsA were less likely to manifest 
enthesitis but displayed increased cardiovascular risk.

Prostate MRI has an important role in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, 
including detection, the targeting of prostate biopsies, staging and guiding 
radiotherapy and active surveillance. However, there are other ''less 
well-known'' applications which are being studied and frequently used in our 
highly specialized medical center. In this review, we focus on two research 
topics that lie within the expertise of this study group: (1) anatomical 
parameters predicting the risk of urinary incontinence after radical 
prostatectomy, allowing more personalized shared decision-making, with special 
emphasis on the membranous urethral length (MUL); (2) the use of 
three-dimensional models to help the surgical planning. These models may be used 
for training, patient counselling, personalized estimation of nerve sparing and 
extracapsular extension and may help to achieve negative surgical margins and 
undetectable postoperative PSA values.

Mass concrete structures under long-term loads are susceptible to time-dependent 
fractures, which pose a threat to their structural integrity and safety. In 
order to study the crack growth rate of concrete materials under long-term 
constant load, the data were processed according to the calculation method of 
fatigue crack growth rate. The relationship between the crack growth rate and 
strength factor in the stable growth stage was obtained using the Paris formula. 
The experimental data and theoretical analysis show that the time-dependent 
fracture curve CMOR(t)-t of the standard three-point bending beam specimens 
could be divided into three stages. The relationship between the crack 
propagation rate da/dt(t) in the second stage and the intensity factor K(t) 
could be well described by the Paris formula. The life of crack growth of a 
standard three-point curved beam is inversely proportional to the level of 
constant load. These conclusions can provide data support for further studies on 
crack extension life under long-term constant load.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common comorbidity of schizophrenia and 
significantly shortens life expectancy of the patients. Intercellular (ICAM), 
vascular (VCAM), and neural (NCAM) cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate 
neuroinflammatory processes, and their soluble forms (e.g., sICAM) in plasma are 
present in parallel with their cell-bound forms. In this study, their serum 
levels were examined in 211 white Siberian patients with paranoid schizophrenia 
(82 patients with and 129 without MetS according to the 2005 International 
Diabetes Federation criteria). Serum levels of CAMs were determined with Magpix 
and Luminex 200 (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) using xMAP Technology. The level of 
sICAM-1 was significantly higher and that of sVCAM-1 significantly lower in 
patients with MetS compared to patients without MetS. Levels of NCAM did not 
differ between the groups. More pronounced Spearman's correlations between CAMs, 
age, duration of schizophrenia, and body-mass index were observed among patients 
without MetS than among patients with MetS. Our results are consistent with 
MetS's being associated with endothelial dysfunction along with other components 
of inflammation. Through these endothelial components of peripheral inflammatory 
processes, MetS might induce intracerebral neuroinflammatory changes, but 
further investigation is needed to confirm this.

The developments in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment and in the care 
of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) 
over the last three decades has led to a significant increase in life 
expectancy, on par with HIV-negative individuals. Aside from the fact that bone 
fractures tend to occur 10 years earlier than in HIV-negative individuals, HIV 
is, per se, an independent risk factor for bone fractures. A few available 
antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) are also linked with osteoporosis, particularly 
those involving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) 
coinfection is associated with a greater risk of osteoporosis and fracture than 
HIV monoinfection. Both the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and measurement 
of bone mineral density (BMD) via a DEXA scan are routinely used in the 
assessment of fracture risk in individuals living with HIV, as bone loss is 
thought to start between the ages of 40 and 50 years old. The main treatment for 
established osteoporosis involves bisphosphonates. Supplementation with calcium 
and vitamin D is part of clinical practice of most HIV centers globally. Further 
research is needed to assess (i) the cut-off age for assessment of osteoporosis, 
(ii) the utility of anti-osteoporotic agents in PLWHIV and (iii) how concomitant 
viral infections and COVID-19 in PLWHIV can increase risk of osteoporosis.

Cancer is a major cause of death and an impediment to increasing life expectancy 
worldwide. With the aim of finding new molecules for chemotherapeutic treatment 
of epidemiological relevance, ten alkaloid fractions from Amaryllidaceae species 
were tested against six cancer cell lines (AGS, BT-549, HEC-1B, MCF-7, MDA-MB 
231, and PC3) with HaCat as a control cell line. Some species determined as 
critically endangered with minimal availability were propagated using in vitro 
plant tissue culture techniques. Molecular docking studies were carried out to 
illustrate binding orientations of the 30 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids identified in 
the active site of some molecular targets involved with anti-cancer activity for 
potential anti-cancer drugs. In gastric cancer cell line AGS, the best results 
(lower cell viability percentages) were obtained for Crinum jagus (48.06 ± 
3.35%) and Eucharis bonplandii (45.79 ± 3.05%) at 30 µg/mL. The research focused 
on evaluating the identified alkaloids on the Bcl-2 protein family (Mcl-1 and 
Bcl-xL) and HK2, where the in vitro, in silico and statistical results suggest 
that powelline and buphanidrine alkaloids could present cytotoxic activity. 
Finally, combining experimental and theoretical assays allowed us to identify 
and characterize potentially useful alkaloids for cancer treatment.

As life expectancy increases in many countries, the prevalence of age-related 
diseases also rises. Among these conditions, chronic kidney disease is predicted 
to become the second cause of death in some countries before the end of the 
century. An important problem with kidney diseases is the lack of biomarkers to 
detect early damage or to predict the progression to renal failure. In addition, 
current treatments only retard kidney disease progression, and better tools are 
needed. Preclinical research has shown the involvement of the activation of 
cellular senescence-related mechanisms in natural aging and kidney injury. 
Intensive research is searching for novel treatments for kidney diseases as well 
as for anti-aging therapies. In this sense, many experimental shreds of evidence 
support that treatment with vitamin D or its analogs can exert pleiotropic 
protective effects in kidney injury. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency has been 
described in patients with kidney diseases. Here, we review recent evidence 
about the relationship between vitamin D and kidney diseases, explaining the 
underlying mechanisms of the effect of vitamin D actions, with particular 
attention to the modulation of cellular senescence mechanisms.

The increase in life expectancy led to a significant rise in the prevalence of 
age-related neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment, dementia, and 
Alzheimer's disease. Although genetics certainly play a role, nutrition emerged 
as a key factor in maintaining optimal cognitive function among older adults. 
Therefore, the study aimed to investigate whether specific categories and 
subcategories of dietary fats, based on carbon-chain length, are associated with 
cognitive status in a cohort of 883 Italian participants over the age of 50.
METHODS: The intake of total, single class of dietary fat, such as saturated 
fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty 
acid (PUFA), and also single fatty acids grouped according to carbon-chain 
length, were evaluated by food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Cognitive health 
was assessed using the short portable mental status questionnaire (SPMSQ).
RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors subjects with a 
moderate consumption of both short-chain SFA (for Q2 vs. Q1, OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 
0.08, 0.66) and middle-chain SFA specifically lauric acid (C12:0) intake (for Q2 
vs. Q1, OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.77) were less likely to suffer from cognitive 
impairment. Among single MUFAs, erucic acid (C22:1) intake resulted in an 
inverse association, in a linear way, with cognitive impairment (for Q4 vs. Q1, 
OR = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.39). Conversely, moderate intake of linoleic acid 
(C18:2) was associated with cognitive impairment (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 4.59, 95% CI: 
1.51, 13.94). Regarding other PUFAs, individuals consuming moderate intake alpha 
linolenic acid (C18:3) were less likely to have cognitive impairment (for Q3 vs. 
Q1, OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Total SFA intake appeared to be inversely associated with cognitive 
impairment. Regarding specific subtypes of fatty acids, the results mostly 
referred to short- and middle-chain SFA. Further studies are needed to validate 
the results of the present study.

Costa Rica, a middle-income country in Central America, has a life expectancy 
similar or even higher than richer countries. This survival advantage is more 
evident among the elderly, who have one of the lowest mortality rates in the 
world. Dietary factors may play a role in this extended longevity. We have shown 
that a traditional rural diet is associated with longer leukocyte telomere 
length-a biomarker of aging-among elderly Costa Ricans. In the present study, we 
used data from the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study (CRELES) to 
characterize further rural and urban diets of the elderly (60+ years). A 
validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual diet. We used 
energy-adjusted regression models to compare the intake of micro- and 
macronutrients between rural and urban regions of the country. Elderly rural 
residents had a higher consumption of carbohydrates (but lower glycemic index), 
fiber, dietary iron, and used more palm oil for cooking than elderly urban 
dwellers. On the other hand, elderly subjects living in urban areas had a higher 
intake of total fat, mono and polyunsaturated fat, alcohol and dietary calcium 
compared to elderly rural residents. Our results are similar to earlier reports 
of middle-aged Costa Ricans and add to the characterization of diet differences 
in rural and urban regions of the country.

BACKGROUND: The world's population is rapidly aging, and attention to and 
research on the increase in life expectancy and age-related diseases are needed. 
This study aimed to review the in vivo studies on the anti-aging effects of 
herbal medicines.
METHODS: In vivo studies of single or complex herbal medicines for anti-aging 
that were published in the last five years were included in this review. The 
following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and 
EMBASE.
RESULTS: A total of 41 studies were considered eligible for the review. The 
articles were classified into body organs and functions, experimental country, 
herbal medicine, extraction method, administration route, dosage, duration, 
animal model, aging-induced method, sex, number of animals per group, and 
outcomes and mechanisms A single herbal extract was used in a total of 21 
studies including Alpinia oxyphylla Miq., Acanthopanax senticosus and Lyceum 
barbarum, and a multi-compound herbal prescription was used in a total of 20 
studies, including Modified Qiongyu paste, Wuzi Yanzong recipe, etc. Each herbal 
medicine had anti-aging effects on learning and memory, cognition, emotion, 
internal organs, gastrointestinal tracts, sexual functions, musculoskeletal 
function and so on. The common mechanisms of action were antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory, and various effects and mechanisms for each organ and 
function were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Herbal medicine exhibited beneficial effects on anti-aging in 
various parts of the body and its function. Further investigation of the 
appropriate herbal medicine prescriptions and their components is recommended.

Expanding the antifungal drug arsenal for treating Candida infections is crucial 
in this era of the rising life expectancy of patients with immunosuppression and 
comorbidities. Infections caused by Candida species are on the rise, including 
those caused by multidrug-resistant strains or species, and the list of 
antifungals approved for the treatment of these infections is still limited. 
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short cationic polypeptides whose 
antimicrobial activity is under intense investigation. In this review, we 
present a comprehensive summary of the AMPs with anti-Candida activity that have 
undergone successful preclinical or clinical trials. Their source, mode of 
action, and animal model of infection (or clinical trial) are presented. In 
addition, as some of these AMPs have been tested in combination therapy, the 
advantages of this approach, as well as the studied cases that have used AMPs 
and other drugs concomitantly to fight Candida infections, are described.

Retinal neurodegeneration is considered an early event in the pathogenesis of 
several ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular 
degeneration, and glaucoma. At present, there is no definitive treatment to 
prevent the progression or reversal of vision loss caused by photoreceptor 
degeneration and the death of retinal ganglion cells. Neuroprotective approaches 
are being developed to increase the life expectancy of neurons by maintaining 
their shape/function and thus prevent the loss of vision and blindness. A 
successful neuroprotective approach could prolong patients' vision functioning 
and quality of life. Conventional pharmaceutical technologies have been 
investigated for delivering ocular medications; however, the distinctive 
structural characteristics of the eye and the physiological ocular barriers 
restrict the efficient delivery of drugs. Recent developments in bio-adhesive in 
situ gelling systems and nanotechnology-based targeted/sustained drug delivery 
systems are receiving a lot of attention. This review summarizes the putative 
mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and mode of administration of neuroprotective drugs 
used to treat ocular disorders. Additionally, this review focuses on 
cutting-edge nanocarriers that demonstrated promising results in treating ocular 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Renal transplantation is the most beneficial treatment in patients with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), increasing life expectancy and improving quality of life. 
A better understanding of organ and tissue functions, the development of 
surgical techniques, and new and effective immunosuppressive and antimicrobial 
drugs increase the success of transplantation. However, the number of renal 
transplantations from living and cadaveric donors is not at the desired 
frequency. Among the leading causes of the restrictions for transplantation are 
both the recipients' and donors' chronic diseases. While hepatitis B and C 
infections are a significant problem affecting the number and success of renal 
transplantations, the innovation of hepatitis C virus treatments has improved 
outcomes. Thus, the recipient and donor hepatitis B and C virus infections are 
no longer considered as relative contraindications for renal transplantation. 
This review discusses the management of patients and donors with hepatitis B and 
hepatitis C in renal transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have 
improved with targeted therapy, including Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors such 
as acalabrutinib.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model with three health states (progression-free, 
progressed disease, and death) estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained for acalabrutinib ± obinutuzumab vs chlorambucil + obinutuzumab in 
treatment-naive CLL (based on ELEVATE-TN). The model used direct costs and 
resource utilization from the US Medicare perspective and utility values sourced 
from literature. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Over a 30-year lifetime horizon, the model base case analysis suggested 
that acalabrutinib monotherapy had an incremental cost of $206,329 and 2.52 
QALYs gained versus chlorambucil + obinutuzumab, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $81,960/QALY. Acalabrutinib + obinutuzumab 
had an incremental cost of $423,747 and 2.79 QALYs gained (ICER: $152,153/QALY). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the probability of acalabrutinib 
monotherapy being cost-effective as 59% to 73% at a $100,000-to-150,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold; the probability of acalabrutinib + obinutuzumab 
being cost-effective ranged from 34% to 51%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the analysis is limited by uncertainty in postprogression 
survival outcomes, acalabrutinib monotherapy is likely cost-effective vs 
chlorambucil + obinutuzumab in treatment-naive CLL in the US Medicare setting.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic condition requiring continued input from the 
CF dietitian as an integral part of the CF multidisciplinary team. In recent 
years, the longer life expectancy experienced by people with CF (PwCF) means 
that nutrition advice and therapy are evolving from a focus on nutrition support 
to prevention and management of comorbidities. Little has been reported 
regarding the perceived role of the CF dietitian amongst PwCF. We report the 
responses to 11 questions that were part of a larger international survey 
distributed to members of national CF charities in 2018-2019. These questions 
evaluated PwCFs' perspectives on (i) the importance of the CF diet, (ii) how 
often PwCF obtain dietary/nutritional advice from their dietitian, (iii) the 
perceived reliability of information given by the dietitian, (iv) other sources 
of CF information and their perceived reliability, and (v) how CF 
nutrition/diet, as well as CF-related diabetes, ranked as research priorities. 
There were 295 respondents from 13 countries. Almost half of the respondents 
(46.8%) contacted their CF dietitian on a frequent/more regular basis, compared 
to medical/scientific journals/medical/scientific search engines. The CF 
dietitian was considered a reliable source of information, as 84% of the 
respondents indicated that the information provided was very/generally reliable. 
At a time when CF care and expectations are changing rapidly, PwCF are in need 
of trusted and reliable information to make positive changes in lifestyle and 
habits. Dietitians working with PwCF should appreciate the pivotal and valued 
role they perform as purveyors of robust evidence-based information to this 
chronic disease population.

The worn-out syndrome: Uncertainties in late working life triggering retirement 
decisions.

In recent decades, the extension of individuals' working life has been construed 
as an important policy issue in Western Europe. Here, retirement causes have 
been thoroughly researched in a quantitative way, but there is a dearth of 
qualitative studies on the subject. Through ethnographic fieldwork, we study the 
complex pathways that lead to the retirement of senior employees in the finance 
and production industries in Denmark. In particular in the finance industry, we 
find an insidious uncertainty haunting senior employees regarding their capacity 
and reputation. We term this uncertainty worn-out syndrome, demonstrating how 
many interlocutors fear that they are beginning to be seen as worn out, for 
example, less productive, less motivated, and too old to work. To some extent, 
this syndrome resembles the impostor syndrome, but it differs in one important 
aspect: the senior employees are mostly confident about their own skills. 
Worn-out syndrome is triggered by stereotypes and implicit ageist remarks by 
colleagues and managers. We show that the worn-out syndrome appears in at least 
three different ways: as a fear of already being worn out, as a fear of being 
perceived as worn out by colleagues and managers, and as a fear of becoming worn 
out in the future without realizing it in time. We argue that current retirement 
decisions are often fueled by this syndrome and that it leads to abrupt and 
untimely retirement decisions.

PURPOSE: In postmenopausal women, optimizing muscular strength and physical 
performance through proper resistance training (RT) is crucial in achieving 
optimal functional reserve later in life. This study aimed to compare if a 
higher-load-to-lower-load (HL-to-LL) scheme is more effective than a 
lower-load-to-higher-load (LL-to-HL) scheme on muscular strength and physical 
performance in postmenopausal women after 12 and 24 wk of RT.
METHODS: Twenty-four postmenopausal women were randomized into two groups: 
LL-to-HL ( n = 12, 27-31 repetitions maximum (RM) in the first 12 wk, and 8-12RM 
in the last 12 wk) or HL-to-LL ( n = 12, 8-12RM during the first 12 wk, and 
27-31RM in the last 12 wk). Muscular dynamic (1RM test) and isometric strength 
(MIVC) and functional tests (sit-to-stand power, 400-m walking, and 6-min 
walking) were analyzed at baseline, after 12 and 24 wk.
RESULTS: Different load intensity transition schemes resulted in enhancements ( 
P < 0.05) in dynamic (45° leg press: LL-to-HL = 21.98% vs HL-to-LL = 16.07%; leg 
extension: LL-to-HL = 23.25% vs HL-to-LL = 16.28%; leg curl: LL-to-HL = 23.89% 
vs HL-to-LL = 13.34%) and isometric strength (LL-to-HL = 14.63% vs HL-to-LL = 
19.42%), sit-to-stand power (LL-to-HL = 7.32% vs HL-to-LL = 0%), and walking 
speed (400-m test: LL-to-HL = 3.30% vs HL-to-LL = 5.52%; 6-min test: LL-to-HL = 
4.44% vs HL-to-LL = 5.55%) after 24 wk of RT, without differences between groups 
( P > 0.05). However, only the HL increased the dynamic strength in 45° leg 
press and leg extension and sit-to-stand power. Moreover, walking speed changes 
were more strongly correlated with the changes in MIVC ( P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that both load intensity transition schemes 
produce similar improvements in muscular strength and physical performance in 
postmenopausal women after 24 wk of RT. However, the HL was more effective in 
increasing 45° leg press and leg extension strength, as well as power (mainly 
when performed after the LL), whereas having little effect on leg curl strength, 
isometric strength, and walking speed. Our findings suggest that although an HL 
makes a muscle isotonically stronger, it may have limited impact on isometric 
strength and walking speed in postmenopausal women.
