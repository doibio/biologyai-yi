OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-utility analysis for two commonly used treatment 
strategies for patients after ACL rupture; early ACL reconstruction (index) 
versus rehabilitation plus an optional reconstruction in case of persistent 
instability (comparator).
METHODS: Patients aged between 18 and 65 years of age with a recent ACL rupture 
(<2 months) were randomised between either an early ACL reconstruction (index) 
or a rehabilitation plus an optional reconstruction in case of persistent 
instability (comparator) after 3 months of rehabilitation. A cost-utility 
analysis was performed to compare both treatments over a 2-year follow-up. 
Cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained, using two perspectives: the healthcare system perspective 
and societal perspective. The uncertainty for costs and health effects was 
assessed by means of non-parametric bootstrapping.
RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were included in the study, of which 85 were 
randomised to the early ACL reconstruction (index) group and 82 to the 
rehabilitation and optional reconstruction group (comparator). From the 
healthcare perspective it takes 48 460 € and from a societal perspective 78 179 
€, to gain a QALY when performing early surgery compared with rehabilitation 
plus an optional reconstruction. This is unlikely to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Routine early ACL reconstruction (index) is not considered 
cost-effective as compared with rehabilitation plus optional reconstruction for 
a standard ACL population (comparator) given the maximum willingness to pay of 
20 000 €/QALY. Early recognition of the patients that have better outcome of 
early ACL reconstruction might make rehabilitation and optional reconstruction 
even more cost-effective.

AIM: With the advent of highly active and combination antiretroviral therapy 
have substantially increased the life expectancy of patients infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, this has brought into sharp contrast the 
incidence of several 'Non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diseases 
such as NeuroAIDS which identifies a group of neurological disorders caused 
primarily by HIV-mediated damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
Given the patients depleted immune condition, the use and abuse of drug and 
addictive substances such as tobacco smoking can further deteriorates their 
overall health and accelerate the progression and severity of the disease. In 
this review we detail the pathogenesis, progression and characteristics of HIV 
and the impact of tobacco smoking as a risk factor for the progression of the 
disease to NeuroAIDS. This is a poorly understood aspect of HIV-related 
complications that needs to be addressed.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Review of theoretical approaches and knowledge synthesis.
RESULTS: Tobacco smoking is highly prevalent in HIV patients when compared to 
the general population. The oxidative damage and inflammatory stress caused by 
chronic smoking on the cerebrovascular system have been well established. 
Considering that HIV patients have an impaired immune system and smokers per se 
are more susceptible to viral and bacterial inflammatory neuropathologies than 
non-smokers, it is conceivable that tobacco smoking as a risk factor for the 
progression of HIV into NeuroAIDS and related neurological impairments.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoke (TS) may bring about a synergistic effect in the 
context of persistent inflammatory state and cerebrovascular damage which 
facilitate HIV infection and progression to NeuroAIDS when compared to 
non-smokers.

Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) are rare diseases caused by genetic defects 
in biochemical pathways. Earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment have 
improved the life expectancy of IMD patients over the last decades, with the 
majority of patients now surviving beyond the age of 20. This has created a new 
challenge: as they grow up, the care of IMD patients' needs to be transferred 
from metabolic pediatricians to metabolic physicians specialized in treating 
adults, through a process called "transition." The purpose of this study was to 
assess how this transition is managed in Europe: a survey was sent to all 77 
centers of the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Disorders 
(MetabERN) to collect information and to identify unmet needs regarding the 
transition process. Data was collected from 63/77 (81%) healthcare providers 
(HCPs) from 20 EU countries. Responders were mostly metabolic pediatricians; of 
these, only ~40% have received appropriate training in health issues of 
adolescent metabolic patients. In most centers (~67%) there is no designated 
transition coordinator. About 50% of centers provide a written individualized 
transition protocol, which is standardized in just ~20% of cases. In 77% of 
centers, pediatricians share a medical summary, transition letter and emergency 
plan with the adult team and the patient. According to our responders, 11% of 
patients remain under pediatric care throughout their life. The main challenges 
identified by HCPs in managing transition are lack of time and shortage of adult 
metabolic physician positions, while the implementations that are most required 
for a successful transition include: medical staff dedicated to transition, a 
transition coordinator, and specific metabolic training for adult physicians. 
Our study shows that the transition process of IMD patients in Europe is far 
from standardized and in most cases is inadequate or non-existent. A transition 
coordinator to facilitate collaboration between the pediatric and adult 
healthcare teams should be central to any transition program. Standardized 
operating procedures, together with adequate financial resources and specific 
training for adult physicians focused on IMDs are the key aspects that must be 
improved in the rare metabolic field to establish successful transition 
processes in Europe.

Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings, constructed on the surfaces of tissue 
engineering scaffolds using layer-by-layer assembly (LbL), promote sustained 
release of therapeutic molecules and have enabled regeneration of large-scale, 
pre-clinical bone defects. However, these systems primarily rely on non-specific 
hydrolysis of PEM components to foster drug release, and their pre-determined 
drug delivery schedules potentially limit future translation into innately 
heterogeneous patient populations. To trigger therapeutic delivery directly in 
response to local environmental stimuli, an LbL-compatible polycation solely 
degraded by cell-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) was synthesized. These 
thioketal-based polymers were selectively cleaved by physiologic doses of ROS, 
stably incorporated into PEM films alongside growth factors, and facilitated 
tunable release of therapeutic bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) upon 
oxidation. These coatings' sensitivity to oxidation was also dependent on the 
polyanions used in film construction, providing a simple method for enhancing 
ROS-mediated protein delivery in vitro. Correspondingly, when implanted in 
critically-sized rat calvarial defects, the most sensitive ROS-responsive 
coatings generated a 50% increase in bone regeneration compared with less 
sensitive formulations and demonstrated a nearly threefold extension in BMP-2 
delivery half-life over conventional hydrolytically-sensitive coatings. These 
combined results highlight the potential of environmentally-responsive PEM 
coatings as tunable drug delivery systems for regenerative medicine.

Polypharmacy is common in older adults with cancer and deprescribing potentially 
inappropriate medications becomes very relevant when life expectancy decreases 
due to metastatic disease. Especially preventive medications may no longer be 
beneficial, because they may decrease quality of life and reduction in morbidity 
and mortality may be futile. Although deprescribing of preventive medication is 
common in the last period of life, it is still unusual during active cancer 
treatment for advanced disease, although life expectancy is often limited to 
less than 1 to 2 years in that stage. We performed a systematic search of the 
literature in Pubmed and Embase on the discontinuation of commonly utilized 
groups of preventive medication and evaluated the evidence of potential benefits 
and harms in patients aged 65 years or older with cancer and a limited life 
expectancy (LLE). From 21 included studies, it can be concluded that 
deprescribing lipid lowering drugs, antihypertensive drugs, osteoporosis drugs 
and antihyperglycemic drugs is feasible in a considerable part of patients with 
a LLE. Discontinuation may be performed safely, without the occurrence of 
serious adverse events or decrease of survival. The only study that addressed 
quality of life after deprescribing showed that discontinuation of statins 
improves quality of life in patients with a LLE. Recurrence of symptoms 
requiring reintroduction occurred in 0-13% of patients on antihyperglycemic 
treatment and 8-60% of patients using antihypertensive drugs. In order to reduce 
pill burden and futile treatment clinicians should discuss deprescribing of 
preventive medication with older patients with advanced cancer and a LLE.

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy increases for lung cancer patients with bone 
metastases, the need for personalized local treatment to reduce pain is 
expanding.
METHODS: Patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT), and local 
treatment including surgery, percutaneous osteoplasty, or radiation. Visual 
analog scale (VAS) and quality of life (QoL) scores were analyzed. VAS at 
12 weeks after treatment was the main outcome. We developed and tested machine 
learning models to predict which patients should receive local treatment. Model 
discrimination was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC), and the best model 
was used for prospective decision-making accuracy validation.
RESULTS: Under the direction of MDT, 161 patients in the training set, 32 
patients in the test set, and 36 patients in the validation set underwent local 
treatment. VAS in surgery, percutaneous osteoplasty, and radiation groups 
decreased significantly to 4.78 ± 1.28, 4.37 ± 1.36, and 5.39 ± 1.31 at 
12 weeks, respectively (p < 0.05), with no significant differences among the 
three datasets, and improved QoL was also observed (p < 0.05). A decision tree 
(DT) model that included VAS, bone metastases character, Frankel classification, 
Mirels score, age, driver gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, and enolase 1 
expression had a best AUC in predicting whether patients would receive local 
treatment of 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94) in the training set, 0.85 (95% CI 
0.77-0.94) in the test set, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.96) in the validation set.
CONCLUSION: Local treatment provided significant pain relief and improved QoL. 
There were no significant differences in reducing pain and improving QoL among 
training, test, and validation sets. The DT model was best at determining 
whether patients should receive local treatment. Our machine learning model can 
help guide clinicians to make local treatment decisions to reduce pain.

Vitamin D with its steroid structure is currently considered as a hormone. New 
target cells of this hormone have been identified, including those in the organs 
of the reproductive system. The aim - to analyze modern sources of domestic and 
foreign scientific literature covering the role of vitamin D in the reproductive 
health of women of different ages. Results. The Russian Federation is endemic in 
terms of vitamin D deficiency. According to statistics, a lack of this vitamin 
is observed in 70-90% of the population of the USA and European countries, which 
brings this problem to the international level. It has been established that 
vitamin D affects not only bone-mineral homeostasis, but also many organs and 
tissues, including the reproductive system, namely the ovaries, uterus, 
placental tissue, pituitary gland and male reproductive organs. Studies have 
proven the positive effect of this hormone on the course of polycystic ovary 
syndrome, endometriosis, diabetes mellitus (including gestational). In addition, 
it has been shown that vitamin D is an important micronutrient during pregravid 
preparation, and the normalization of its level can improve the quality and 
increase the life expectancy of women after 50-60 years. Conclusion. Vitamin D 
plays an important role in many physiological processes, including the effects 
on the organs of the reproductive system. The significant influence of this 
vitamin can be traced from the beginning of intrauterine development to the end 
of life, which makes its further study an important area of modern medicine, 
including within the framework of obstetrics and gynecology.

OBJECTIVE: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the 
United States and outbreaks frequently occur in daycare settings. Results of 
norovirus vaccine trials have been promising, however there are open questions 
as to whether vaccination of daycare children would be cost-effective. We 
investigated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical norovirus 
vaccination for children in daycare settings compared to no vaccination.
METHODS: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using a disease 
transmission model of children attending daycare. Vaccination with a 90% 
coverage rate in addition to the observed standard of care (exclusion of 
symptomatic children from daycare) was compared to the observed standard of 
care. The main outcomes measures were infections and deaths averted, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective, 
including medical costs to children as well as productivity losses of parents, 
over a two-year time horizon. Data sources included outbreak surveillance data 
and published literature.
RESULTS: A 50% efficacious norovirus vaccine averts 571.83 norovirus cases and 
0.003 norovirus-related deaths per 10,000 children compared to the observed 
standard of care. A $200 norovirus vaccine that is 50% efficacious has a net 
cost increase of $178.10 per child and 0.025 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of 
$7,028/QALY. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated that 
a $200 vaccination with 50% efficacy was 94.0% likely to be cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY threshold and 95.3% likely at a 
$150,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: Due to the large disease burden associated with norovirus, it is 
likely that vaccinating children in daycares could be cost-effective, even with 
modest vaccine efficacy and a high per-child cost of vaccination. Norovirus 
vaccination of children in daycare has a cost-effectiveness ratio similar to 
other commonly recommended childhood vaccines.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a significant burden of 
disease for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, a population that 
continues to experience a lower life expectancy than other Australians. The aim 
of the Better Cardiac Care Data Linkage project is to describe patient care 
pathways and to identify disparities in care and health outcomes between 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Queensland residents 
diagnosed with CVD in the state of Queensland.
METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked 
regional, state and national health and administrative data collections to 
describe disparities in CVD healthcare in primary and secondary prevention 
settings and during hospitalisation. The CVD cohort will be identified from the 
Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection for admissions that 
occurred between 1 July 2010 and 31 June 2016 and will include relevant 
International Classification of Disease codes for ischaemic heart disease, 
congestive heart failure, stroke, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart 
disease. Person-level data will be linked by Data Linkage Queensland and the 
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) in accordance with ethical and 
public health approvals to describe the patient journey prior to, during and 
post the hospital admission.
ANALYSIS: This project will focus largely on descriptive epidemiological 
measures and multivariate analysis of clinical care standards and outcomes for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with other Queenslanders, 
including identification of risk factors for suboptimal care and change over 
time. Variation in care pathways and patient outcomes will be compared by 
Indigenous status, sex, age group, remoteness of residence, year of index 
hospitalisation and socioeconomic status. Cox models for time-to-event data and 
mixed models or generalised estimating equations for longitudinal data will be 
used to measure change over time where temporal effects exist.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by Human Research 
Ethics Committees of the Prince Charles Hospital (HREC/15/QPCH/289) and the AIHW 
(EO2016-1-233). The Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School 
of Health Research have also provided reciprocal ethical approval of the project 
(HREC 2019-3490). The deidentified results will be summarised in a report and 
shared with investigators, advisory groups, Queensland Health and key 
stakeholders. Findings will be disseminated through workshops, conferences and 
will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important group of compounds of 
major environmental concern, which are in the class of persistent organic 
pollutants. Therefore, the key purpose of this research was to analyze seasonal 
fluctuations and to determine the probability of polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons in coastal sediments of the Iranian Marine Resource Center based on 
the evaluation of 16 US-EPA important PAH compounds. These compounds have been 
collected from intertidal sediments located in the marine resources of southern 
Iran in different seasons. These samples of the surficial sediment were 
collected at the PSEEZ area using a stainless steel grab sampler in four 
seasons, from depths between 0.5 and 30 m. Surface sediment samples were removed 
by spoons and carefully placed in an aluminum foil; they were taken to the 
laboratory on ice and held at 20° C until their study. After extraction, by 
using a rotary evaporator apparatus, samples were condensed. The assay was added 
to roughly 2 g of activated copper flasks in the refrigerator for 36 h for 
desulfurization. Among different seasons, the highest concentration was observed 
in winter, with a mean of 281.3 ng g-1. According to ecological risk assessment 
(concentrations of possible effects, low effect range, degree of threshold 
effects, and median effect range), PAH risks in surface sediments of PSEEZ were 
lower than the threshold results levels (TEL), possible effects levels (PEL), 
low range of effects (ERL), and median range of effects (ERM), indicating that a 
biological effect would rarely occur. The dry weight scale of the concentration 
of ∑PAHs ranges from 145.7 to 348.42 ng g-1 with a mean quantity of 
260.52 ng g-1. Therefore, according to the amount of ∑PAH concentration, the 
sediments in the PSEEZ area indicated moderate to heavy pollutions. In this way, 
the sedimentary surface ecosystems of the Persian Gulf were considered as 
moderately polluted compared with other ecosystems worldwide. Our study 
highlighted some of the research gaps in PAH contamination studies and the level 
of PAH contamination. Therefore, this study will provide a scientific 
background, planning, and policies for PAH pollution control and environmental 
protection in Iran and similar regions around the world.

Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing 
to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as 
supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies 
have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the 
signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence 
on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a 
systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the 
process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, 
Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and 
Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were 
randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral 
supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at 
least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and 
firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were 
selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70 years (95% 
women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable 
results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of 
skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and 
elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, 
ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90 days is effective in reducing skin 
aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.

Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Salvage surgeries are rarely offered and performed in 
prostate cancer except for isolated lymph node metastases. Meanwhile, data are 
sufficient that salvage radical prostatectomy is recommended by the guidelines. 
In the following review, we focus on different treatment strategies comparing 
open and DaVinci laparoscopic approach with regard to functional and oncologic 
outcome. Of further interest are palliative surgeries.
RECENT FINDINGS: Salvage radical prostatectomy is mainly performed in high 
volume centres. Data are increasing on minimal invasive surgery, although data 
on functional outcome are conflicting. As patients with prostate cancer have 
longer life expectancy even in metastasized disease, the possibility of 
developing symptomatic progression increases as well. We need to be aware that 
the confrontation with symptomatic prostate cancer patients will be more 
frequent in the future and that there are surgical approaches to palliate these 
patients sufficiently.
SUMMARY: Data on minimal invasive salvage radical prostatectomy are getting more 
valid and are an option in experienced centres. Salvage radical prostatectomy is 
a definitive curative option for the patients. To avoid local progression, 
palliative local surgeries need to be discussed with the patients.

Italy is the sixth most populous country in Europe and has the second highest 
average life expectancy, reaching 79.4 years for men and 84.5 for women. 
However, Italy has one of the lowest total fertility rates in the world: in 2018 
it was 1.3 births per woman, with the population older than 65 comprising more 
than 30%, and those younger-than-19 less than 15%. Older people are the main 
concern of the Italian health system. Weighted coefficients for the allocation 
of funds favour older adults. As confirmed by our study, paediatric radiology is 
expensive, and the reimbursement based on Italian adult rates is not sufficient. 
The negative impact on the budget discourages the diffusion of paediatric 
radiology both in the private practices that provide services paid for by the 
state government and in the public hospitals. The 501 paediatric hospital units 
in Italy are not homogeneously distributed throughout the national territory. 
Furthermore, in Italy there are 12 highly specialised children's hospitals whose 
competences were defined in 2005 by the Ministry of Health. Paediatric radiology 
is not included among the highly qualified specialties. The quality gap in 
paediatric radiology between children's hospitals and general hospitals, the 
latter often without paediatric radiologists, is evident in daily practice with 
misdiagnoses and investigations not carried out.

The malaria parasite has a single mitochondrion which carries multiple tandem 
repeats of its 6 kb genome encoding three proteins of the electron transport 
chain. There is little information about DNA repair mechanisms for mitochondrial 
genome maintenance in Plasmodium spp. Of the two AP-endonucleases of the BER 
pathway encoded in the parasite nuclear genome, the EndoIV homolog PfApn1 has 
been identified as a mitochondrial protein with restricted functions. We 
explored the targeting and biochemical properties of the ExoIII homolog PfApe1. 
PfApe1 localized in the mitochondrion and exhibited AP-site cleavage, 3'-5' 
exonuclease, 3'-phosphatase, nucleotide incision repair (NIR) and RNA cleavage 
activities indicating a wider functional role than PfApn1. The parasite enzyme 
differed from human APE1 in possessing a large, disordered N-terminal extension. 
Molecular modelling revealed conservation of structural domains but variations 
in DNA-interacting residues and an insertion in the α-8 loop suggested 
differences with APE1. Unlike APE1, where AP-site cleavage and NIR activities 
could be mutually exclusive based on pH and Mg2+ ion concentration, PfApe1 was 
optimally active under similar conditions suggesting that it can function both 
as an AP-endonuclease in BER and directly cleave damaged bases in NIR under 
similar physiological conditions. To investigate the role of Ape1 in malaria 
life cycle, we disrupted the gene by double-cross-over homologous recombination. 
Ape1 knockout (KO) P. berghei parasites showed normal development of blood and 
mosquito stages. However, inoculation of mice with Ape1 KO salivary gland 
sporozoites revealed a reduced capacity to initiate blood stage infection. Ape1 
KO parasites underwent normal liver stage development until merozoites egressed 
from hepatocytes. Our results indicated that the delay in pre-patent period was 
due to the inability of Ape1 KO merosomes to infect erythrocytes efficiently.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with advanced colorectal adenomas (ACAs) are at high 
risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and it is unclear which chemopreventive agent 
(CPA) is safe and cost-effective for secondary prevention. We aimed to 
determine, firstly, the most suitable CPA using network meta-analysis (NMA) and 
secondly, cost-effectiveness of CPA with or without surveillance colonoscopy 
(SC).
METHODS: Systematic review and NMA of randomised controlled trials were 
performed, and the most suitable CPA was chosen based on efficacy and the most 
favourable risk-benefit profile. The economic benefits of CPA alone, 3 yearly SC 
alone, and a combination of CPA and SC were determined using the 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in the Malaysian health-care perspective. 
Outcomes were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2018 
US Dollars ($) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and life-years (LYs) 
gained.
RESULTS: According to NMA, the risk-benefit profile favours the use of aspirin 
at very-low-dose (ASAVLD, ≤ 100 mg/day) for secondary prevention in individuals 
with previous ACAs. Celecoxib is the most effective CPA but the cardiovascular 
adverse events are of concern. According to CEA, the combination strategy 
(ASAVLD with 3-yearly SC) was cost-saving and dominates its competitors as the 
best buy option. The probability of being cost-effective for ASAVLD alone, 
3-yearly SC alone, and combination strategy were 22%, 26%, and 53%, 
respectively. Extending the SC interval to five years in combination strategy 
was more cost-effective when compared to 3-yearly SC alone (ICER of $484/LY gain 
and $1875/QALY). However, extending to ten years in combination strategy was not 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: ASAVLD combined with 3-yearly SC in individuals with ACAs may be a 
cost-effective strategy for CRC prevention. An extension of SC intervals to five 
years can be considered in resource-limited countries.

BACKGROUND: In Spain, homeless individuals have lower perceived quality of 
health than the rest of the population and their life expectancy is 30 years 
lower than the national average. While the Spanish health system provides 
universal access and coverage, homeless individuals do not access or use public 
care enough to maintain their health. The objective of this study is to 
determine if homeless individuals can access public health services in 
conditions of equality with the rest of the population, as established in 
healthcare legislation, and to better understand the causes of observed 
inequalities or inequities of access.
METHODS: A detailed qualitative study was carried out in the city of Barcelona 
(Spain) from October 2019 to February 2020. A total of nine open and in-depth 
interviews were done with homeless individuals along with seven semi-structured 
interviews with key informants and two focus groups. One group was composed of 
eight individuals who were living on the street at the time and the other 
consisted of eight individuals working in healthcare and social assistance.
RESULTS: The participants indicated that homeless individuals tend to only 
access healthcare services when they are seriously ill or have suffered some 
kind of injury. Once there, they tend to encounter significant barriers that 
might be 1) administrative; 2) personal, based on belief that that will be 
poorly attended, discriminated against, or unable to afford treatment; or 3) 
medical-professional, when health professionals, who understand the lifestyle of 
this population and their low follow-through with treatments, tend towards 
minimalist interventions that lack the dedication they would apply to other 
groups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions derived from this study convey the infrequent use 
of health services by homeless individuals for reasons attributable to the 
population itself, to healthcare workers and to the entire healthcare system. 
Accordingly, to reduce inequities of access to these services, recommendations 
to healthcare service providers include adapting facilities to provide more 
adequate care for this population; increasing sensitivity/awareness among 
healthcare workers; developing in situ care systems in places where the homeless 
population is most concentrated; and establishing healthcare collaboration 
agreements with entities that work with this population.

BACKGROUND: Inconsistent use of generic and disease-specific health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) instruments in multiple sclerosis (MS) studies limits 
cross-country comparability. The objectives: 1) investigate real-world HRQOL of 
MS patients using both generic and disease-specific HRQOL instruments in the 
Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Italy; 2) compare 
HRQOL among these countries; 3) determine factors associated with HRQOL.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational online web-based survey amongst MS 
patients was conducted in June-October 2019. Patient demographics, clinical 
characteristics, and two HRQOL instruments: the generic EuroQOL (EQ-5D-5L) and 
disease-related Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54, an extension of 
the generic Short Form-36 (SF-36) was collected. Health utility scores were 
calculated using country-specific value sets. Mean differences in HRQOL were 
analysed and predictors of HRQOL were explored in regression analyses.
RESULTS: In total 182 patients were included (the Netherlands: n = 88; France: 
n = 58; the United Kingdom: n = 15; Spain: n = 10; living elsewhere: n = 11). 
Mean MSQOL-54 physical and mental composite scores (42.5, SD:17.2; 58.3, 
SD:21.5) were lower, whereas the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores 
(46.8, SD:22.6; 53.1, SD:22.5) were higher than reported in previous clinical 
trials. The mean EQ-5D utility was 0.65 (SD:0.26). Cross-country differences in 
HRQOL were found. A common predictor of HRQOL was disability status and primary 
progressive MS.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of MS on HRQOL in real-world patients may be 
underestimated. Combined use of generic and disease-specific HRQOL instruments 
enhance the understanding of the health needs of MS patients. Consequent use of 
the same instruments in clinical trials and observational studies improves 
cross-country comparability of HRQOL.
