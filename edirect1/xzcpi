DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this clinical practice update is to evaluate the 
evidence describing the interaction between direct-acting antiviral (DAA) 
therapy for hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regard to HCC 
incidence, HCC recurrence, and DAA efficacy, and to summarize best practice 
advice regarding HCC surveillance and timing of DAA therapy.
METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on 
available published evidence, including observational studies and systematic 
reviews, and incorporates expert opinion where applicable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 
1: DAA treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of incident HCC. The 
relative risk reduction is similar in patients with and without cirrhosis. BEST 
PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis 
should receive surveillance imaging before initiating DAA treatment. BEST 
PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis at 
the time of DAA treatment represent the highest-risk group for HCC after 
DAA-induced sustained virologic response. These patients should stay in HCC 
surveillance. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: HCC surveillance should be performed using 
ultrasound with or without α-fetoprotein every 6 months. Current data do not 
support shorter surveillance intervals or the use of alternative surveillance 
modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Future studies may show a reduction in HCC 
risk over time after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. However, in the 
interim, HCC surveillance should continue indefinitely if patients are otherwise 
eligible for potentially curative therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The presence 
of active HCC is associated with a small but statistically significant decrease 
in sustained virologic response with DAA therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: 
Patients with HCC who are eligible for potentially curative therapy with liver 
resection or ablation should defer DAA therapy until after HCC treatment is 
completed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Timing of DAA therapy for patients with HCC 
who are listed for liver transplantation should be determined with consideration 
of median wait times, availability of hepatitis C virus-positive organs, and 
degree of liver dysfunction. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: There are insufficient data 
evaluating benefits and cost-effectiveness of DAA therapy in patients with 
active intermediate or advanced HCC. Decisions regarding DAA treatment in these 
patients should be considered in light of HCC tumor burden, degree of liver 
dysfunction, life expectancy, and patient preferences. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: 
There are no conclusive data that DAA therapy is associated with increased or 
decreased risk, differential time to recurrence, or aggressiveness of recurrent 
HCC in patients with complete response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: 
DAA therapy should not be withheld from patients with complete response to HCC 
therapy; however, DAA therapy can be deferred 4-6 months to confirm response to 
HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients with complete response to HCC 
therapy who are treated with DAAs have a continued risk of HCC recurrence and 
require HCC surveillance, which should be conducted indefinitely with dynamic 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 3-6 
months. Current data do not support more frequent surveillance in these 
patients. This Clinical Practice Update was produced by the AGA Institute.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that long-term exposure to ambient air 
pollution reduces life expectancy. Most studies have been in environments with 
relatively high concentrations such as North America, Europe and Asia. 
Associations at the lower end of the concentration-response function are not 
well defined.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed associations between all-cause mortality and exposure to 
annual average particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 
Sydney, Australia, where concentrations are relatively low.
METHODS: The '45 and Up Study' comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort from 
the state of New South Wales, Australia with 266,969 participants linked to 
death registry data. We analyzed data for the participants who resided in Sydney 
at baseline questionnaire (n = 75,268). Exposures to long-term pollution were 
estimated using annual averages from a chemical transport model (PM2.5), and a 
satellite-based land-use regression model (NO2). Socio-demographic information 
was extracted from the baseline questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard models 
were applied to estimate associations, while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: In our cohort mean annual PM2.5 was 4.5 μg/m3 and mean NO2 was 
17.8 μg/m3. The mortality rate was 4.4% over the 7 years of follow up. Models 
that adjusted for individual-level and area-level risk factors resulted in a 
detrimental non statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 (95% CI: 
0.98-1.12) per 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98-1.07) per 
5 μg/m3 increase in NO2.
CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that low-level air pollution exposure was 
associated with increased risk of mortality in this cohort of adults aged 
45 years and over, even at the relatively low concentrations seen in Sydney. 
However, a clear determination of the association with mortality is difficult 
because the results were sensitive to some covariates. Our findings are 
supportive of emerging evidence that exposure to low levels of air pollution 
reduces life expectancy.

This study is the first to use reliable data sources to establish a reasonable 
mass balance of Cr(VI) contamination in river water, sediment, and farmland 
soil. A system dynamics model was used to establish the interrelationships among 
water, Cr(VI) contamination, and health effects in the Wu River watershed 
(between Taichung city and Changhua county) between 2018 and 2048 (30 years). 
The results show very little Cr(VI) contamination in rivers; most flowed 
downstream or settled in sediment, and the accumulation of Cr(VI) in the 
sediment increased throughout the study period. The highest Cr(VI) 
concentrations in farmland soil (338.46 mg/kg) were reached in Changhua county 
as a result of greater Cr(VI) contamination from upstream and local factories. 
This Cr(VI) contamination led to gastric cancer risks of 5.24 × 10-4 and 
4.38 × 10-6 in Changhua county and Taichung city, respectively. Although most of 
the Cr(VI) contamination was discharged from Taichung City, greater health risks 
and losses occurred downstream in Changhua county; medical costs were 55 times 
higher. For total quality control, a reduction rate of at least 68% should be 
reached in the study area. These findings will be helpful in predicting the 
transmission of Cr(VI) contamination over long study periods with a systematic 
model.

INTRODUCTION: Infants with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 typically face a 
decline in motor function and a severely shortened life expectancy. Clinical 
trials for SMA type 1 therapies, onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101) and 
nusinersen, demonstrated meaningful improvements in efficacy (e.g., overall 
survival) but there were no head-to-head clinical trials assessing comparative 
efficacy. This study estimated the treatment effects of AVXS-101 relative to 
nusinersen for the treatment of SMA type 1.
METHODS: Overall survival, event-free survival (no death or need to use 
permanent assisted ventilation), improvement in motor function [increase of ≥ 4 
points in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular 
Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score from baseline], and motor milestone achievements 
(head control, rolling over, and sitting unassisted) reported in the 
onasemnogene abeparvovec (AVXS-101-CL-101; NCT02122952) and nusinersen (ENDEAR; 
NCT02193074) clinical trials were indirectly compared using frequentist and 
Bayesian approaches.
RESULTS: Among symptomatic infants with SMA type 1, the number needed to treat 
(NNT) to prevent one more death with AVXS-101 instead of nusinersen was 6.2 [95% 
confidence intervals (CI) = 4.1-12.2], and the probability of preventing death 
was 20% higher for patients treated with AVXS-101 than nusinersen [risk ratio 
(RR) = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3]. For event-free survival, the NNT to prevent one 
more event was 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.6) and RR was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.9). For 
improvement in motor function, NNT was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6-5.3) and RR was 1.4 (95% 
CI 1.2-1.6). For milestone achievements, the NNTs were 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.9), 1.5 
(95% CI 1.1-2.5), and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.5); RRs 4.2 (95% CI 2.6-6.7), 7.8 (95% 
CI 3.6-17.0), and 11.2 (95% CI 5.1-24.5) for head control, rolling over, and 
sitting unassisted, respectively. Results were similar using the Bayesian 
approach.
CONCLUSION: This indirect comparison (AVXS-101-CL-101 vs. ENDEAR) among 
symptomatic SMA type 1 infants suggests that AVXS-101 may have an efficacy 
advantage relative to nusinersen for overall survival, independence from 
permanent assisted ventilation, motor function, and motor milestones.

INTRODUCTION: The stable, ultra-long duration of action of insulin degludec 
(degludec) minimizes fluctuations in glucose-lowering activity over the daily 
(24-h) dosing period, and comparative studies with other basal insulins suggest 
that these properties translate into a lower risk of hypoglycemia at equivalent 
levels of glycemic control. Results from the real-world European multicenter, 
retrospective chart review study of 2550 patients with type 1 and type 2 
diabetes (T1D and T2D) in routine clinical care EU-TREAT (NCT02662114) showed 
that patients benefited from improved glycemic control and significantly reduced 
rates of hypoglycemia following a switch to degludec.
METHODS: In this post hoc analysis, EU-TREAT patients were stratified into good 
(≤ 7.5% HbA1c), intermediate (> 7.5 to ≤ 8.5% HbA1c), and poor (> 8.5% HbA1c) 
glycemic control at baseline to investigate the possibility of differential 
benefits, either improved control or reduced risk of hypoglycemia, whichever the 
need. Changes in HbA1c, overall hypoglycemia, and total insulin dose from 
baseline to 6 and 12 months follow-up were assessed for each group.
RESULTS: For both T1D and T2D patients, those in good initial control 
experienced significant reductions in rates of hypoglycemia and total insulin 
dose following the switch, without compromising control. Those in poor initial 
control achieved significant improvements in HbA1c with no change in rates of 
hypoglycemia or total insulin dose.
CONCLUSION: This analysis expands the findings of EU-TREAT by showing 
differential changes in the clinical endpoints depending on particular need. It 
introduces the possibility that the differential benefits of degludec could 
address two of the renowned clinical challenges faced when treating diabetes: 
improving glycemic control for optimal management of T1D and titrating insulin 
dose in T2D, both without fear of increased hypoglycemia.

The disclosure of a cancer diagnosis in an elderly person is often difficult. It 
can be impacted by sensory or cognitive disorders, a depressive condition, or by 
the presence of family members. It is important to take account of a disease 
which is sometimes at an advanced stage, reduced life expectancy and obvious 
frailty. The disclosure should always be made whatever the clinical situation, 
but always with an adapted, honest and step-by-step process.

BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders are increasingly recognised as major causes 
of death and disability worldwide. The aim of this analysis from the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide 
the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and 
national burden from neurological disorders.
METHODS: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with 
disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories 
(tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, 
traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, 
idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category 
for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 
2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of 
estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model 
(CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 
risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological 
disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of 
DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247-308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 
million [8·8-9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all 
neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34-44] and DALYs by 
15% [9-21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% 
[26-30] and DALYs by 27% [24-31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological 
disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs 
were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of 
neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6-46·1]), migraine (16·3% 
[11·7-20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0-12·1]), and meningitis 
(7·9% [6·6-10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised 
DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female 
ratio 1·12 [1·05-1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type 
headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female 
ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of 
neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5-90·9) 
of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's 
disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8-35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) 
and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8-17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable).
INTERPRETATION: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by 
the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing 
and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply 
increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, 
rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of 
established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates 
that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary disorder. AATD 
is a known risk factor for the development of emphysema and liver disease. A 
cohort of severe (PiZZ) and moderate (PiSZ) AAT-deficient newborn infants was 
identified by the Swedish national neonatal AAT screening in 1972-1974 and has 
been followed up since birth. Our aim was to study survival in this cohort up to 
43-45 years of age in comparison with the general Swedish population.
METHODS: Data from 127 PiZZ, 2 PiZnull, 54 PiSZ, and 1 PiSnull subjects, who 
were identified by the neonatal screening in 1972-1974, were included in the 
study. To compare death rates in the PiZZ and PiSZ individuals with the general 
Swedish population, a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated as the 
ratio of observed to expected deaths.
RESULTS: Seven PiZZ subjects died during the follow-up, to be compared with an 
expected 3.66 deaths for the general population, giving an SMR of 1.91 (95% CI 
0.77-3.94). Four PiSZ subjects died compared to an expected 1.53 deaths, giving 
an SMR of 2.61 (95% CI 0.71-6.71). The cumulative probability of survival up to 
the age of 45 years was 94% (95% CI 90%-98%) for the study population. Six 
deaths occurred before the age of 8 years.
CONCLUSION: Up to 43-45 years of age, there was no difference in survival 
between PiZZ and PiSZ individuals in comparison with the Swedish general 
population. The majority of deaths occurred during childhood.

BACKGROUND: Current pharmacological therapies for COPD improve quality of life 
and symptoms and reduce exacerbations. Given the progressive nature of COPD, it 
is arguably more important to understand whether the available therapies are 
able to delay clinical deterioration; the concept of "clinically important 
deterioration" (CID) has therefore been developed. We evaluated the efficacy of 
the single-inhaler triple combination beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol 
fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G), using data from three large 1-year 
studies.
METHODS: The studies compared BDP/FF/G to BDP/FF (TRILOGY), tiotropium 
(TRINITY), and indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY; TRIBUTE). All studies 
recruited patients with symptomatic COPD, FEV1 <50%, and an exacerbation 
history. We measured the time to first CID and to sustained CID, an endpoint 
combining FEV1, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations, and death. The time to first CID was based on the first 
occurrence of any of the following: a decrease of ≥100 mL from baseline in FEV1, 
an increase of ≥4 units from baseline in SGRQ total score, the occurrence of a 
moderate/severe COPD exacerbation, or death. The time to sustained CID was 
defined as: a CID in FEV1 and/or SGRQ total score maintained at all subsequent 
visits, an exacerbation, or death.
RESULTS: Extrafine BDP/FF/G significantly extended the time to first CID vs 
BDP/FF (HR 0.61, P<0.001), tiotropium (0.72, P<0.001), and IND/GLY (0.82, 
P<0.001), and significantly extended the time to sustained CID vs BDP/FF (HR 
0.64, P<0.001) and tiotropium (0.80, P<0.001), with a numerical extension vs 
IND/GLY.
CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic COPD, FEV1 <50%, and an exacerbation 
history, extrafine BDP/FF/G delayed disease deterioration compared with BDP/FF, 
tiotropium, and IND/GLY.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The studies are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: TRILOGY, 
NCT01917331; TRINITY, NCT01911364; TRIBUTE, NCT02579850.

Iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDIs) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, being 
one of the most common performed surgical procedures, remain a substantial 
problem in gastrointestinal surgery with a significant impact on patient's 
quality of life. The primary aim of this review was to discuss the 
classification of BDIs, the proposed methods to prevent biliary lesions, the 
associated risk factors, and the management challenges depending on the timing 
of recognition of the injury, its extension, the patient's clinical condition, 
and the availability of experienced hepatobiliary surgeons. Early recognition of 
BDI is of paramount importance and limiting the diagnosis delay is crucial for 
an optimal postoperative outcome. The therapeutic management depends on the type 
and gravity of the biliary lesion, and includes endoscopic, radiologic, and 
surgical approaches.

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits formed during the first 5 y of life portend lifelong 
eating patterns.
OBJECTIVE: The Synergistic Theory Research Obesity and Nutrition Group (STRONG) 
Kids 2 birth cohort study aimed to examine multilevel predictors of weight 
trajectories and dietary habits including individual biology, child 
socioemotional and behavioral characteristics, family environment, and child 
care environment over the first 5 y of life. This report describes recruitment 
strategies, an overview of survey measures, and basic descriptive statistics of 
the cohort.
METHODS: The cohort includes 468 mothers and their offspring. A brief survey was 
completed at a 1-wk home visit including child's birth weight, intent to 
breastfeed, collection of an infant stool sample, and additional contact 
information should the family move. Mothers completed surveys including diet, 
child temperament, family environment, and child care when their child was 6 wk, 
3, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 mo of age. Height and weight of the mother and 
child were collected at each visit. Stool samples of the child were collected at 
each visit as well as saliva at 1 visit.
RESULTS: Close to half of the mothers were either overweight (24.2%) or obese 
(25.2%) prepregnancy. At 6 wk of age, 32.9% of the children were overweight and 
31.4% were obese based on direct measurement.
CONCLUSIONS: The STRONG Kids 2 research team has adopted a socioecological model 
that accounts for multiple influences on children's health including biological, 
child social and behavioral, family household organization, and community 
factors. The study is limited by a relatively educated and nondiverse sample. 
However, variations in maternal and child weight may inform future prevention 
programs and policy aimed at improving the diet and health of children under the 
age of 5 y.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03341858.

Cost-effectiveness of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Screening before Immigration 
to Low-Incidence Countries.

Campbell JR, Johnston JC, Cook VJ, Sadatsafavi M, Elwood RK, Marra F.

Prospective migrants to countries where the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is 
low (low-incidence countries) receive TB screening; however, screening for 
latent TB infection (LTBI) before immigration is rare. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of mandated and sponsored preimmigration LTBI screening for 
migrants to low-incidence countries. We used discrete event simulation to model 
preimmigration LTBI screening coupled with postarrival follow-up and treatment 
for those who test positive. Preimmigration interferon-gamma release assay 
screening and postarrival rifampin treatment was preferred in deterministic 
analysis. We calculated cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained for migrants 
from countries with different TB incidences. Our analysis provides evidence of 
the cost-effectiveness of preimmigration LTBI screening for migrants to 
low-incidence countries. Coupled with research on sustainability, acceptability, 
and program implementation, these results can inform policy decisions.

Type II Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) is an abnormality in which the 
cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata are displaced downward into the spinal 
cord. Type II ACM is often complicated by respiratory depression, 
sleep-disordered breathing, and deglutition disorder as a result of medullary 
dysfunction and impairment of the lower cranial nerves. Bending and stretching 
of the neck is restricted, and anesthetic management is problematic in patients 
with the disorder. We performed dental treatment twice under intravenous 
sedation in a patient with intellectual disability with type II ACM complicated 
by hypercapnic respiratory failure. Propofol was used for the first sedation 
procedure. Repeated bouts of respiratory depression occurred on that occasion, 
so the airway was managed manually by lifting the jaw. However, aspiration 
pneumonitis occurred postoperatively. A combination of dexmedetomidine and 
midazolam was used for sedation on the second occasion, and the intervention was 
completed uneventfully without any respiratory depression. Our experience with 
this patient highlights the need for selection of an agent for intravenous 
sedation that does not require neck extension and has minimal effect on 
respiration in patients with type II ACM, who are at high risk of respiratory 
depression and pulmonary aspiration.

Background: Although metabolic syndrome (MetS) was described in the late 80s, 
the molecular mechanisms underlying clustering of risk factors in certain 
individuals are not fully understood. The present study used targeted proteomics 
to establish cardiometabolic proteins related to all MetS components, thereby 
providing new hypotheses regarding pathways involved in the pathogenesis of 
MetS. Methods: In the EpiHealth study, 249 cardiometabolic proteins were 
measured by proximity extension assay (PEA) and related to the five MetS 
components [consensus-modified National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) 
criteria] in 2,444 participants aged 45-75 years (50% women). Results: 
Thirty-one proteins were associated with systolic blood pressure following 
adjustment for age and sex (P < 0.000040, taking multiple testing into account). 
The corresponding number of proteins significantly associated with fasting 
glucose, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum 
triglycerides were 58, 132, 127, and 148. Twenty-two proteins were significantly 
related to all 5 MetS components, and of those, 20 were with MetS as a binary 
outcome (n = 600, 24% of the sample) following adjustment for age, sex, fat 
mass, and lifestyle factors (alcohol intake, smoking, education, and exercise 
habits). Conclusion: Using targeted proteomics, we identified 20 proteins 
reflecting a range of pathways, such as immunomodulation at different levels; 
regulation of adipocyte differentiation; lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid 
metabolism; or insulin-like growth factor signaling, to be strongly associated 
with MetS independently of fat mass and lifestyle factors. Whether some of these 
proteins are causally involved in the pathogenesis of clustering of multiple 
risk factors in the same individual remains to be investigated.

BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) are 
typically older adults with multiple comorbidities that are associated with a 
reduction in the efficacy of iNPH treatment via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt 
placement.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of CSF shunt 
for iNPH using data from a nationwide epidemiological survey in Japan.
METHODS: We examined 1,423 patients (581 women) aged ≥60 years (median age 
[25%-75%]: 77 [73-80] years) who were diagnosed with iNPH following a hospital 
visit in 2012. Patients who experienced an improvement of at least one modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) grade after the CSF shunt were classified as "improvement" 
while the remaining patients were classified as "non-improvement." The efficacy 
of the shunt intervention (n = 842) was analyzed using a binomial logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: An analysis of risk factors associated with shunt placement in patients 
with mRS grade 2 revealed an association between comorbid chronic ischemic 
lesions (odds ratio [OR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-4.67; 
p = 0.025) and cervical spondylosis (OR, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.15-11.34; p = 0.027). 
Patients with mRS grade 3 at study entry had an association with comorbid 
Alzheimer's disease (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.44-6.31; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here showed that any age-related risk is 
minimal and should not be cause for rejection of surgical treatment options. 
Clinical decisions regarding CSF shunt should be individualized to each patient, 
with adequate consideration of the relative risks and benefits, including 
maximizing a healthy life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Incidence of anal carcinoma is increased in people living with HIV 
(PLWH). Due to the improved life expectancy in PLWH, identifying appropriate 
prevention strategies for non-AIDS-defining cancer types such as anal carcinoma 
has become a priority in managing PLWH today.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate anal cytology assessment as screening tool for 
anal dysplasia and/or carcinoma in PLWH, regardless of gender or sexual 
orientation. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between cancer risk 
factors and abnormal screening results in our patient cohort.
METHODS: People living with HIV from the Interdisciplinary HIV Centre of the 
University Hospital rechts der Isar in Munich, Germany (IZAR), were screened for 
anal carcinoma by single cytobrush examination and anal Papanicolaou (PAP) smear 
assessment from 2013 to 2015. Patients with abnormal PAP smear result were 
offered a follow-up examination after 12 months. Differences between two groups 
were tested for statistical significance using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney 
U-test, as appropriate.
RESULTS: In total, 101 PLWH were included. 26.7% of subjects (n = 27) were PAP 
IIID, and 9.9% (n = 10) were PAP IVa. Seven female subjects had an abnormal 
finding at screening. Smoking was significantly associated with abnormal 
findings at screening (P = 0.005). In addition, our study found an association 
between sexually transmitted infections (STI) and anal dysplasia. Condylomata 
acuminata were increased in subjects with PAP IIID/PAP IVa (P = 0.045). Reactive 
syphilis serology was found to be significantly associated with abnormal 
screening results (P = 0.016), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that smoking and two common STIs, 
condylomata acuminata and syphilis, are risk factors associated with advanced 
anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) stages in our PLWH cohort. While further 
analysis is needed to determine diagnostic guidelines concerning AIN in PLWH, 
these results suggest that interdisciplinary lifestyle prevention strategies are 
required to reduce the risk factors for AIN in PLWH in an outpatient setting.

China has entered an aging society since 1999. By the end of 2017, the number of 
persons aged ≥60 years had increased to 240.90 million. At present, the average 
life expectancy of China's population is 76.4 years, and the healthy life 
expectancy is around 68.7 years, which means that the elderly will be 
accompanied by disease for about 8 years. The main health problems of the 
elderly in China include increased prevalence of chronic diseases, increased 
prevalence of disability, insufficient attention to older persons' mental health 
and area specific differences in the health level of the elderly. The disease 
status of the elderly cannot be ignored. Strengthening the medical services in 
western and rural areas, emphasizing the psychological and mental concern for 
the elderly, formulating unified health evaluation criteria, promoting a new 
model of medical and nursing care combination, establishing an elderly security 
system with equal responsibilities and rights, jointly managing under the 
cooperation of whole society and multi-dimensions to protect the health of the 
elderly are essential to the construction of an active ageing society in China 
and the realization of the strategic goal of healthy China.

1999年我国进入老龄化社会，截至2017年底，全国≥60周岁老年人口2.4亿人。目前，我国人均预期寿命76.4岁，健康平均预期寿命约68.7岁，提示老年人将会有8年左右的时间与疾病相伴；其主要特征表现为，慢性病患病率呈上涨趋势，失能老年人不断增加，老年人心理状况关注度不够，而且老年人健康水平呈现地区差异。老年人患病现状不容忽视，加强西部和农村地区医疗服务水平，提升对于老年人心理和精神关注，制定统一评价标准促进健康评估，推进新型医养结合模式，建立责权对等的老年保障体系，全社会、多维度齐抓共管保障老年人健康，对我国积极应对老龄化社会的构建，实现健康中国战略目标至关重要。.

[Effects of Lifestyle Redesign on older adults: A systematic review].

[Article in French; Abstract available in French from the publisher]

Lévesque MH, Trépanier J, Sirois MJ, Levasseur M.

BACKGROUND. The Lifestyle Redesign® (LR) aims to support health, functioning, 
and quality of life of older adults through the development of healthy and 
meaningful routines. However, evidence concerning the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of this intervention is scattered.
PURPOSE. This study aimed to synthetize the clinical effects and 
cost-effectiveness of the LR as well as to verify the applicability of the 
results in a community-based setting in Quebec.
METHOD. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, followed by a focus 
group with four occupational therapists.
FINDINGS. Considered as cost-effective (under $50,000 in quality-adjusted 
life-years), the LR offers benefits for both mental and physical health. 
According to occupational therapists, the LR is clearly relevant for their 
practice but involves some challenges.
IMPLICATIONS. The LR is an occupational therapy intervention with promising 
clinical effects and cost-effectiveness for older adults living in the 
community.

Publisher: DESCRIPTION. Le Lifestyle Redesign® (LR) a pour objectif de soutenir, 
à travers des routines occupationnelles saines et signifiantes, la santé, le 
fonctionnement et la qualité de vie d’aînés. Les données probantes concernant 
son efficacité et sa rentabilité sont toutefois dispersées.
BUT. Cette étude visait à synthétiser les effets cliniques et le coût-efficacité 
du LR et à vérifier l’applicabilité des résultats en milieu communautaire 
québécois.
