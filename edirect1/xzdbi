Differences in life expectancy between the top and bottom 5% of the cPRS were 
estimated to be 4.79 (1.76, 7.81) years and 6.75 (4.16, 9.35) years for women 
and men, respectively. These associations were substantially attenuated after 
adjusting for non-genetic mortality risk factors measured at study entry (i.e., 
middle age for most participants). The cPRS may be useful in counseling younger 
individuals at higher genetic risk of mortality on modification of non-genetic 
factors.

INTRODUCTION: Although smoking restrictions at child-related settings are 
progressively being adopted, school outdoor entrances are neglected in most 
smoke-free policies across Europe.
OBJECTIVES: To describe secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and tobacco-related 
signs in outdoor entrances of primary schools in Europe according to area-level 
socioeconomic status (SES), smoke-free policy, national smoking prevalence, and 
geographical region.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we monitored vapor-phase nicotine 
concentrations at 220 school outdoor entrances in 11 European countries (March 
2017-October 2018). To account for nicotine presence, we used the laboratory's 
limit of quantification of 0.06 μg/m3 as point threshold. We also recorded the 
presence of smell of smoke, people smoking, cigarette butts, and ashtrays. Half 
of the schools were in deprived areas. We grouped countries according to their 
Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) score, smoking prevalence (2017-2018), and United 
Nations M49 geographical region.
RESULTS: There were detectable levels of nicotine in 45.9% of the outdoor 
entrances, in 29.1% smell of smoke, in 43.2% people smoking, in 75.0% discarded 
butts, and in 14.6% ashtrays. Median nicotine concentration was below the 
laboratory's limit of quantification <0.06 μg/m3 (Interquartile 
range:<0.06-0.119). We found higher SHS levels in countries with lower TCS 
scores, higher national smoking prevalence, and in the Southern and Eastern 
European regions. People smoking were more common in schools from lower 
area-level SES and in countries with lower TCS scores (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking at school outdoor entrances is a source of SHS exposure in 
Europe. These findings support the extension of smoking bans with a clear 
perimeter to the outdoor entrances of schools.

[Hematologic malignancies and health economics].

Center.

Recently, there has been an increasing drive to consider the cost effectiveness 
of healthcare. Since clinical trials usually examine disease-free survival 
without considering overall survival, it is difficult to determine which 
treatment is cost effective. At present, the overall survival time is estimated 
using a Markov model, and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is calculated by 
taking into account the quality and quantity of life lived. In Japan, the cost 
required to obtain 1 QALY is expected to be around 5 million yen, and drug 
prices are being influenced by policy. Indubitably, this type of health 
economics also has limitations and is not equal for everyone. Thus, 
collaboration is necessary to discuss better and more efficient medical care. It 
is hoped that this review of two diseases of hematopoietic malignancy will 
enhance our understanding of health economics.

Organisms have limited resources available to invest in reproduction, causing a 
trade-off between the number and size of offspring. One consequence of this 
trade-off is the evolution of disparate egg sizes and, by extension, 
developmental modes. In particular, echinoid echinoderms (sea urchins and sand 
dollars) have been widely used to experimentally manipulate how changes in egg 
size affect development. Here, we test the generality of the echinoid results by 
(a) using laser ablations of blastomeres to experimentally reduce embryo energy 
in the asteroid echinoderms (sea stars), Pisaster ochraceus and Asterias forbesi 
and (b) comparing naturally produced, variably sized eggs (1.7-fold volume 
difference between large and small eggs) in A. forbesi. In P. ochraceus and 
A. forbesi, there were no significant differences between juveniles from both 
experimentally reduced embryos and naturally produced eggs of variable size. 
However, in both embryo reduction and egg size variation experiments, 
simultaneous reductions in larval food had a significant and large effect on 
larval and juvenile development. These results indicate that (a) food levels are 
more important than embryo energy or egg size in determining larval and juvenile 
quality in sea stars and (b) the relative importance of embryo energy or egg 
size to fundamental life history parameters (time to and size at metamorphosis) 
does not appear to be consistent within echinoderms.

BACKGROUND: Sedative use in older adults increases the risk of falls, fractures, 
and hospitalizations. The D-PRESCRIBE (Developing Pharmacist-Led Research to 
Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions 
Burden in the Elderly), pragmatic randomized clinical trial demonstrated that 
community-based, pharmacist-led education delivered simultaneously to older 
adults and their primary care providers reduce the use of sedatives by 43% over 
6 months. However, the associated health benefits and cost savings have yet to 
be described. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE 
intervention compared to usual care for reducing the use of potentially 
inappropriate sedatives among older adults.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the public health care perspective of 
Canada estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated 
with the D-PRESCRIBE intervention compared to usual care over a 1-year time 
horizon. Transition probabilities, intervention effectiveness, utility, and 
costs were derived from the literature. Probabilistic analyses were performed 
using a decision tree and Markov model to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Compared to usual care, pharmacist-led deprescribing is less costly 
(-$1392.05 CAD) and more effective (0.0769 QALYs). Using common 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50 000 and $100 000, D-PRESCRIBE was the 
optimal strategy. Scenario analysis indicated the cost-effectiveness of 
D-PRESCRIBE is sensitive to the rate of deprescribing.
CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacist-led deprescribing of sedatives is 
cost-effective, leading to greater quality-of-life and harm reduction among 
older adults. As the pharmacist's scope of practice expands, consideration 
should be given to interprofessional models of remuneration for quality 
prescribing and deprescribing services.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with colonoscopy and the fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) is underused. Innovative tests could increase 
screening acceptance. This study determined which of the available alternatives 
is most promising from a cost-effectiveness perspective.
METHODS: The previously validated Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model 
was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening with capsule endoscopy 
every 5 or 10 years, computed tomographic colonography every 5 years, the 
multi-target stool DNA test every 1 or 3 years, and the methylated SEPT9 DNA 
plasma assay (mSEPT9) every 1 or 2 years. We also compared these strategies with 
annual FIT screening and colonoscopy screening every 10 years. Quality-adjusted 
life-years gained (QALYG), number of colonoscopies, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were projected. We assumed a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100 000 per QALYG.
RESULTS: Among the alternative tests, computed tomographic colonography every 
5 years, annual mSEPT9, and annual multi-target stool DNA screening had 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $1092, $63 253, and $214 974 per QALYG, 
respectively. Other screening strategies were more costly and less effective 
than (a combination of) these 3. Under the assumption of perfect adherence, 
annual mSEPT9 screening resulted in more QALYG, CRC cases averted, and CRC 
deaths averted than annual FIT screening but led to a high rate of colonoscopy 
referral (51% after 3 years, 69% after 5 years). The alternative tests were not 
cost-effective compared with FIT and colonoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that for individuals not willing to participate 
in FIT or colonoscopy screening, mSEPT9 is the test of choice if the high 
colonoscopy referral rate is acceptable to them.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis exhibit the same qualitative and 
quantitative changes in immune system cells observed in aging. In the last 20 
years, multiple sclerosis patients have shown an increase in life expectancy and 
average age, but clinical trial inclusion criteria typically exclude patients 
over the age of 55 years. Therefore, disease-modifying therapies are likely 
administered to patients older than those enrolled in clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: In order to investigate whether disease-modifying therapies for 
multiple sclerosis induce modifications to the immune system that may have 
(super)additive effects resulting in an acceleration of immunosenescence, we 
quantified the number of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and K-deleting 
recombination excision circles (KRECs). These molecules are contained in new T 
and B lymphocytes released by the thymus and bone marrow and are considered 
molecular age-related markers.
METHODS: The markers of aging were measured by a multiplex quantitative 
real-time PCR assay in 122 patients who had started therapy with interferon-beta 
(IFN-β), fingolimod, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab. Samples were obtained before 
the therapy and at 6 and 12 months of treatment. Comparisons between the 
variables were performed by a non-parametric statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In therapy-naive patients, a significant and direct correlation was 
found between a lower number of newly produced T and B cells and older age. 
Although disease-modifying therapies induced different changes (both increases 
and decreases) in the production of new T and B lymphocytes, 12 months of 
therapy with IFN-β or natalizumab did not affect the correlations found at 
baseline between the release of lymphocytes containing TRECs or KRECs and age. 
On the contrary, in patients treated with alemtuzumab, both correlations were 
lost, while in fingolimod-treated patients, only the correlation between TRECs 
and age disappeared.
CONCLUSIONS: This observational study indicated that different age-related 
changes of the new T and B lymphocyte production could be one of the reasons for 
the emergence, in the real-world setting, of adverse events not otherwise 
observed in clinical trials; thus, caution is advised when choosing 
disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis patients.

Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease, the extent of CF lung 
disease is decisive for the course and survival of patients. The optimization of 
symptomatic therapies has led to a significant improvement in the life 
expectancy of those affected in recent decades. Regular monitoring of the course 
of CF lung disease with microbiological, pulmonary function, and imaging 
examinations is essential for early detection of problems and individualized 
therapy. With new, causal therapy options in the form of cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators and early diagnosis 
through newborn screening, a further normalization of life expectancy and 
quality of life of CF patients can be expected.

This article examines the relationship between the financial crisis of 2008 and 
the health of Italians using aggregate and individual health indicators in 
correlation with the socioeconomic changes which have occurred in the Italian 
population. First, the study contextualises the changes referring to some 
important health indicators (life expectancy, death and suicide rates). Then, 
the main hypothesis on the relation between worsened individual health 
conditions and socioeconomic deterioration is tested. For this purpose, 
individual data from 2005 to 2013 stemming from Health Condition and Use of 
Health Services surveys (Italian National Institute of Statistics) are analysed. 
The results show that the social categories most severely affected by the 
crisis, in both employment and economic terms, were basically the same as those 
that experienced a worsening of their physical and psychological health 
conditions. These categories of people have a low level of educational 
attainment, live in southern and insular regions and are most often men.

BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates some individuals who engage in heavy 
drinking following treatment for alcohol use disorder fare as well as those who 
abstain with respect to psychosocial functioning, employment, life satisfaction, 
and mental health. The current study evaluated whether these findings replicated 
in an independent sample and examined associations between recovery profiles and 
functioning up to 6 years later.
METHODS: Data were from the 3-year and 7- to 9-year follow-ups of subsamples 
initially recruited for the COMBINE study (3-year follow-up: n = 694; 30.1% 
female, 21.0% non-White; 7- to 9-year follow-up: n = 127; 38.9% female, 27.8% 
non-White). Recovery at 3 years was defined by latent profile analyses including 
measures of health functioning, quality of life, employment, alcohol 
consumption, and cannabis and other drug use. Functioning at the 7- to 9-year 
follow-up was assessed using single items of self-rated general health, 
hospitalizations, and alcohol consumption.
RESULTS: We identified 4 profiles at the 3-year follow-up: (i) low-functioning 
frequent heavy drinkers (13.9%), (ii) low-functioning infrequent heavy drinkers 
(15.8%), (iii) high-functioning heavy drinkers (19.4%), and (iv) 
high-functioning infrequent drinkers (50.9%). At the 7- to 9-year follow-up, the 
2 high-functioning profiles had the best self-rated health, and the 
high-functioning heavy drinking profile had significantly fewer hospitalizations 
than the low-functioning frequent heavy drinking profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous findings showing heterogeneity in recovery outcomes were 
replicated. Most treatment recipients functioned well for years after treatment, 
and a subset who achieved stable recovery engaged in heavy drinking and reported 
good health outcomes up to 9 years after treatment. Results question the 
long-standing emphasis on drinking practices as a primary outcome, as well as 
abstinence as a recovery criterion in epidemiologic and treatment outcome 
research and among stakeholder groups and funding/regulatory agencies. Findings 
support an expanded recovery research agenda that considers drinking patterns, 
health, life satisfaction, and functioning.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LSG) for cancer is associated 
with good perioperative outcomes and superior quality of life compared with the 
open approach, albeit at higher cost. An economic evaluation was conducted to 
compare the two approaches.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis between LSG and open subtotal gastrectomy 
(OSG) for gastric cancer was performed using a decision-tree cohort model with a 
healthcare system perspective and a 12-month time horizon. Model inputs were 
informed by a meta-analysis of relevant literature, with costs represented in 
2016 Canadian dollars (CAD) and outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). A secondary analysis was conducted using inputs extracted solely from 
European and North American studies. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base-case model, costs of LSG were $935 (€565) greater than 
those of OSG, with an incremental gain of 0·050 QALYs, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $18 846 (€11 398) per additional QALY 
gained from LSG. In the DSA, results were most sensitive to changes in 
postoperative utility, operating theatre and equipment costs, as well as 
duration of surgery and hospital stay. PSA showed that the likelihood of LSG 
being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 (€30 240) per 
QALY and $100 000 (€60 480) per QALY was 64 and 68 per cent respectively. 
Secondary analysis using European and North American clinical inputs resulted in 
LSG being dominant (cheaper and more effective) over OSG, largely due to reduced 
length of stay after LSG.
CONCLUSION: In this decision analysis model, LSG was cost-effective compared 
with OSG for gastric cancer.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: Pese a su mayor coste, la gastrectomía subtotal 
laparoscópica se asocia con buenos resultados perioperatorios y una mejor 
calidad de vida en comparación con la cirugía abierta en el tratamiento del 
cáncer. Se realizó una evaluación económica comparando los dos abordajes. 
MÉTODOS: Se efectuó un análisis de coste-efectividad de la gastrectomía subtotal 
laparoscópica (laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy, LSG) o de la gastrectomía 
subtotal abierta (open subtotal gastrectomy, OSG) en el cáncer gástrico 
utilizando un modelo de cohortes con árbol de decisión desde la perspectiva del 
sistema de salud y con un horizonte temporal de 12 meses. Los gastos del modelo 
fueron evaluados tras un metaanálisis de literatura relevante y expresados en 
dólares canadienses (Canadian dollars, CAD) del 2016. Los resultados se midieron 
en años de vida ajustados por su calidad (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs). 
Se realizó un análisis secundario utilizando los datos extraídos únicamente de 
estudios europeos y norteamericanos. Además, se realizaron análisis de 
sensibilidad determinístico y probabilístico (deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, DSA y PSA).
RESULTADOS: En el modelo del caso base, los costes de la LSG fueron de 934,78$ 
(565€) más que en la OSG, con una ganancia incremental de 0,050 QALYs, que 
supuso una relación coste-efectividad incremental (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER) de 18.846,12$ (11.398€) por QALY adicional en la 
LSG. En el DSA, los resultados fueron más sensibles a cambios en el 
postoperatorio, quirófano y coste de los equipos, así como en la duración de la 
intervención y la hospitalización. El PSA demostró que la probabilidad de que la 
LSG fuera rentable en términos de disposición de pago (willingness-to-pay, WTP) 
para dos umbrales, de 50.000$ (30.240€) y 100.000$ (60.480€) por QALY fue del 
64% y del 68%, respectivamente. En el análisis secundario utilizando los datos 
europeos y norteamericanos se demostró que la LSG era claramente dominante (más 
barata y más efectiva) que la OSG, en gran parte debido a la reducción de la 
estancia hospitalaria de la LSG. CONCLUSIÓN: En este modelo de análisis de 
decisión, la LSG fue coste-efectiva en comparación con la OSG para el cáncer 
gástrico.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

of Medicine, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Patients with coarctation of the aorta have a high prevalence of 
intracranial aneurysms (IA) and suffer subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at younger 
ages than the general population. American Heart Association/American College of 
Cardiology guidelines recommend IA screening, but appropriate age and interval 
of screening and its effectiveness remain a critical knowledge gap.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of magnetic 
resonance angiography screening for IA in patients with coarctation of the 
aorta, we developed and calibrated a Markov model to match published IA 
prevalence estimates. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. Secondary outcomes included lifetime cumulative incidence of prophylactic 
IA treatment and mortality and SAH deaths prevented. Using a payer perspective, 
a lifetime horizon, and a willingness-to-pay of $150 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained, we applied a 3% annual discounting rate to costs and effects 
and performed 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In a 
simulated cohort of 10 000 patients, no screening resulted in a 10.1% lifetime 
incidence of SAH and 183 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 
years led to 978 prophylactic treatments for unruptured aneurysms, 19 
procedure-related deaths, and 65 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, 
and 30 years was cost-effective compared with screening at ages 10 and 20 years 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $106 841/quality-adjusted life-year). 
Uncertainty in the outcome after aneurysm treatment and quality of life after 
SAH influenced the preferred screening strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective in 41% of 
simulations and at ages 10 and 20 in 59% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model supports the American Heart Association/American College 
of Cardiology recommendation to screen patients with coarctation of the aorta 
for IA and suggests screening at ages 10 and 20 or at 10, 20, and 30 years would 
extend life and be cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: (1) To produce Peruvian general population EQ-5D-5L value sets on a 
quality-adjusted life-year scale, (2) to investigate the feasibility of a "Lite" 
protocol less reliant on the composite time trade-off (cTTO), and (3) to compare 
cTTO and discrete choice experiment (DCE) value sets.
METHODS: A random sample of adults (N = 1000) in Lima, Arequipa, and Iquitos did 
a home interview; 300 were randomly selected to complete 11 cTTOs first. All 
respondents completed a DCE, including 10 latent-scale pairs (A/B) with 5 
EQ-5D-5L attributes, and 12 matched pairs (A/B and B/C) with 5 EQ-5D-5L and one 
lifespan attributes. We estimated a cTTO heteroscedastic tobit (N = 300) model 
and 3 DCE Zermelo-Bradley-Terry models (N = 300, 700, and 1000).
RESULTS: Each model produced a consistent value set (20 positive incremental 
parameters). Nevertheless, their lowest quality-adjusted life-year values 
differed greatly (cTTO: -1.076 [N = 300]; DCE: -0.984 [300], 0.048 [700], -0.213 
[1000]). Compared with the cTTO, the DCE (N = 300) produced different parameters 
(Pearson's correlation = 0.541), fewer insignificant parameters (0 vs 8), and 
fewer values less than 0 (26% vs 44%). Compared with the DCE (N = 300), the DCE 
(N = 700) produced higher values but similar parameters (Pearson's correlation = 
0.800).
CONCLUSIONS: Besides producing EQ-5D-5L value sets for Peru, the results casts 
doubt about the feasibility of a Lite protocol like the one in this study. 
Additionally, fundamental differences between cTTO and DCE-without the existence 
of a gold standard-need further clarification. The choice between the two 
rational value sets produced in the current study is a matter of judgment and 
may have substantial policy implications.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare the minimally important difference (MID) in 
index score of country-specific EQ-5D-5L scoring algorithms developed using 
EuroQol Valuation Technology protocol version 2, including algorithms from 
Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, Poland, Portugal, Taiwan, and the United 
States.
METHODS: A simulation-based approach contingent on all single-level transitions 
defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system was used to estimate the MID for each 
algorithm.
RESULTS: The resulting mean (and standard deviation) instrument-defined MID 
estimates were Germany, 0.083 (0.022); Indonesia, 0.093 (0.012); Ireland, 0.098 
(0.023); Malaysia, 0.072 (0.010); Poland, 0.080 (0.030); Portugal, 0.080 
(0.018); Taiwan, 0.101 (0.010); and the United States, 0.078 (0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: These population preference-based MID estimates and accompanying 
evidence of how such values vary as a function of baseline index score can be 
used to aid interpretation of index score change. The marked consistency in the 
relationship between the calculated MID estimate and the range of the EQ-5D-5L 
index score, represented by a ratio of 1:20, might substantiate a rule of thumb 
allowing for MID approximation in EQ-5D-5L index score warranting further 
investigation.

Chemical crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has been 
increasingly used in structural biology. CXMS distance restraints are usually 
applied to Cα or Cβ atoms of the crosslinked residues, with upper bounds 
typically over 20 Å. The incorporation of loose CXMS restraints only marginally 
improves the resolution of the calculated structures. Here, we present a revised 
format of CXMS distance restraints, which works by first modifying the 
crosslinked residue with a rigid extension derived from the crosslinker. With 
the flexible side chain explicitly represented, the reformatted restraint can be 
applied to the modification group instead, with an upper bound of 6 Å or less. 
The short distance restraint can be represented and back-calculated simply with 
a straight line. The use of tighter restraints not only afford better-resolved 
structures but also uncover protein dynamics. Together, our approach enables 
more information extracted from the CXMS data.

OBJECTIVES: The public health disorder gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) 
is linked with several comorbidities, including oesophageal adenocarcinoma 
(OAC), but whether life expectancy is reduced by GORD is uncertain. This study 
assessed all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in GORD after controlling for 
confounding by heredity and other factors.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study from 1998 to 2015.
SETTING: Swedish nationwide study.
PARTICIPANTS: Twins (n=40 961) born in 1958 or earlier in Sweden.
EXPOSURE: GORD symptoms reported in structured computer-assisted telephone 
interviews.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome 
was cancer-specific mortality among twins with GORD and twins without GORD. HRs 
and 95% CIs were analysed using parametric survival models, both in individual 
twin analyses and co-twin pair analyses, with adjustment for body mass index, 
smoking, education and comorbidity.
RESULTS: Among 40 961 individual twins, 5812 (14.2%) had GORD at baseline and 
8062 (19.7%) died during follow-up of up to 16 years. The risks of all-cause 
mortality (HR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=0.99, 
95% CI: 0.89-1.10) were not increased in individual twins with GORD compared 
with individual twins without GORD. Similarly, there were no differences in 
mortality outcomes in within-pair analyses. The OAC-specific mortality rate was 
0.45 (95% CI: 0.32-0.66) per 1000 person-years in individual twins with GORD and 
0.22 (95% CI: 0.18-0.27) per 1000 person-years without GORD, rendering an 
adjusted HR of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.35-2.98).
CONCLUSIONS: GORD did not increase all-cause or cancer-specific mortality when 
taking heredity and other confounders into account. The increased relative risk 
of mortality in OAC was low in absolute numbers.

Objective: High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are heterogeneous, often 
diagnosed at an advanced stage, and associated with poor overall survival (OS, 
39% at five years). There are few data about the prognostic factors of late 
relapses in HGSOC patients who survived ≥five years, long-term survivors (LTS). 
The aim of our study is to assess the probability of survival according to the 
already survived time from diagnosis. Methods: Data from HGSOC patients treated 
between 1995 and 2016 were retrospectively collected to estimate the conditional 
probability of survival (CPS), probability of surviving Y years after diagnosis 
when the patient had already survived X years, and to determine the LTS 
prognostic factors. The primary endpoint was OS. Results: 404 patients were 
included; 120 of them were LTS. Patients were aged 61 years (range: 20-89), WHO 
performance status 0-1 in 86.9% and 2 in 13.1%, and Fédération Internationale de 
Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) staging III and IV in 82.7% and 17.3% 
patients. Breast cancer (BRCA) status was available in 116 patients (33% 
mutated), including 58 LTS (36% mutated). No macroscopic residual disease was 
observed in 58.4% patients. First-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus 
paclitaxel was administered in 80.4% of patients (median: six cycles (range: 
1-14)). After a 9 point 3-year follow-up, median OS was four years (95% CI: 
3.6-4.5). The CPS at five years after surviving one year was 42.8% (95% CI: 
35.3-48.3); it increased to 81.7% (95% CI: 75.5-87.8) after four survived years. 
Progression-free interval>18 months was the only LTS prognostic factor in the 
multivariable analysis (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.13-0.40; p < 0.001). 
Conclusion: The CPS provided relevant and encouraging clinical information on 
the life expectancy of HGSOC patients who already survived a period of time 
after diagnosis. LTS prognostic factors are useful for clinicians and patients.

Health, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, China.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the dementia-free life expectancy (DemFLE) 
and age trends of the population over 60 in 2018 in Jiangxi Province, China, by 
sex and urban-rural areas.
METHODS: Based on the Summary of Health Statistics of Jiangxi Province in 2018 
and the Sixth National Health Service survey of Jiangxi Province, the model life 
table is used to estimate the age-specific mortality rate by sex and urban-rural 
areas. DemFLE and its ratio to life expectancy (LE) were calculated using the 
Sullivan method.
RESULTS: In 2018, the DemFLE at age 60 was 18.48 years for men and 21.31 years 
for women, accounting for 96.62% and 96.67% of their LE. LE and DemFLE were 
higher for those in urban areas than in rural areas, except for men aged 90 and 
above; higher in women than in men, except for people in rural areas aged 90 and 
above. In urban areas, DemFLE/LE was higher for women than for men; the opposite 
was observed in rural areas. Urban women had a higher DemFLE/LE than rural women 
did, urban men had a lower DemFLE/LE than rural men did.
CONCLUSIONS: With increased LE, DemFLE also increases, but with older age and 
over time, DemFLE/LE gradually decreases. The effect of dementia on elderly 
adults becomes more serious. It is necessary for the government to implement a 
series of prevention strategies to improve the quality of life and health 
awareness of the elderly. Elderly urban men and elderly rural women need more 
attention and health care.

BACKGROUND: Adherence to treatment is key to achieve desired outcomes. In COPD, 
adherence is generally suboptimal and is impaired by treatment complexity.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic impact of an improvement in 
treatment adherence due to an increased use of once-daily single-inhaler triple 
therapy (SITT) in patients with COPD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 7-state Markov model with monthly cycles was developed. 
Patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, for whom triple therapy is 
indicated, were included. Outcomes and costs were estimated and compared for two 
scenarios: current distribution of adherent patients treated with multiple 
inhaler triple therapies (MITT) vs a potential scenario where patients shifted 
to once-daily SITT. In the potential scenario, adherence improvement due to 
once-daily SITT attributes was estimated. Costing was based on the Spanish 
National Health System (NHS) perspective (€2019). A 3-year time horizon was 
defined considering a 3% discount rate for both costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: A target population of 185,111 patients with moderate-to-very severe 
COPD currently treated with MITT was estimated. A 20% increase in the use of 
once-daily SITT in the potential scenario raised adherence up to 52%. This 
resulted in 6835 exacerbations and 532 deaths avoided, with 775 LYs and 594 
QALYs gained. Total savings reached €7,082,105. Exacerbation reduction accounted 
for 61.8% (€4,378,201) of savings.
CONCLUSION: Increasing the use of once-daily SITT in patients with 
moderate-to-very severe COPD treated with triple therapy would be associated 
with an improvement in adherence, a reduction of exacerbations and deaths, and 
cost savings for the Spanish NHS.
