patients were still living at the time of this writing, more than 2, 6, and 14 
years after treatment initiation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Kampo 
medicine may be useful for disease control and supportive care for patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotics have led to considerable increases in life expectancy. 
However, over time, antimicrobial resistance has accelerated and is now a 
significant global public health concern. Understanding societal preferences for 
the use of antibiotics as well as eliciting the willingness to pay for future 
research is crucial.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate preferences for different strategies to optimize 
antibiotic use and to understand the willingness to pay for future research in 
antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial drug development.
METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was administered to a sample of the UK 
general population. Respondents were asked to make nine choices, each offering 
three options-two hypothetical "doctor and antibiotics" and one "no doctor-no 
antibiotics"-defined by five attributes: treatment, days needed to recover, risk 
of bacterial infection that needs antibiotics, risk of common side effects, and 
risk of antimicrobial resistance by 2050. Data were analyzed using random 
parameters logit models. A double-bounded contingent valuation was also included 
in the survey to explore the willingness to pay for policies to contain 
antimicrobial resistance.
RESULTS: Among the 2579 respondents who completed the survey, 1151 always 
selected "no doctor-no antibiotics" and 57 never varied their choices; 
therefore, 1371 responses were used in the analysis. Risk of antimicrobial 
resistance by 2050 was the most important attribute and the "treatment" was the 
least important attribute, although this was sensitive to a higher risk of 
bacterial infection. The aggregate annual willingness to pay for containing 
antimicrobial resistance was approximately £8.35 billion (~£5-£10 billion).
CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance risk is relevant and important to the 
general public. The high willingness to pay suggests that large investments in 
policies or interventions to combat antimicrobial resistance are justified.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of responsive 
neurostimulation (RNS) therapy for management of medically refractory focal 
onset seizures compared to pharmacotherapy alone.
METHODS: We created and analyzed a decision model for treatment with RNS therapy 
versus pharmacotherapy using a semi-Markov process. We adopted a public payer 
perspective and used the maximum duration of 9 years in the RNS long-term 
follow-up study as the time horizon. We used seizure frequency data to model 
changes in quality of life and estimated the impact of RNS therapy on the annual 
direct costs of epilepsy care. The model also included expected mortality, 
adverse events, and costs related to system implantation, programming, and 
replacement. We interpreted our results against societal willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50 000, $100 000, and $200 000 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY).
RESULTS: Based on three different calculated utility value estimates, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for RNS therapy (with continued 
pharmacotherapy) compared to pharmacotherapy alone ranged between $28 825 and 
$46 596. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded ICERs often below $50 000 per 
QALY and consistently below $100 000/QALY.
SIGNIFICANCE: Modeling based on 9 years of available data demonstrates that RNS 
therapy for medically refractory epilepsy very likely falls within the range of 
cost-effectiveness, depending on method of utility estimation, variability in 
model inputs, and willingness-to-pay threshold. Several factors favor improved 
cost-effectiveness in the future. Given the increasing focus on delivering 
cost-effective care, we hope that this analysis will help inform clinical 
decision-making for this surgical option for refractory epilepsy.

While limited evidence suggests that longer sleep durations can improve 
metabolic health in habitual short sleepers, there is no consensus on how 
sustained sleep extension can be achieved. A total of 18 men (mean [SD] age 
41 [ 9] years), who were overweight/obese (mean [SD] body mass index 
30 [3] kg/m2 ) and short sleepers at increased risk of type 2 diabetes were 
randomised to a 6-week sleep-extension programme based on cognitive behavioural 
principles (n = 10) or a control (n = 8) group. The primary outcome was 6-week 
change in actigraphic total sleep time (TST). Fasting plasma insulin, insulin 
resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]), 
blood pressure, appetite-related hormones from a mixed-meal tolerance test, and 
continuous glucose levels were also measured. Baseline to 6-week change in TST 
was greater in the sleep-extension group, at 79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
68.90, 88.05) versus 6 (95% CI -4.43, 16.99) min. Change in the sleep-extension 
and control groups respectively also showed: lower fasting insulin (-11.03 [95% 
CI -22.70, 0.65] versus 7.07 [95% CI -4.60, 18.74] pmol/L); lower systolic 
(-11.09 [95% CI -17.49, -4.69] versus 0.76 [95% CI -5.64, 7.15] mmHg) and 
diastolic blood pressure (-12.16 [95% CI -17.74, -6.59] versus 1.38 [95% CI 
-4.19, 6.96] mmHg); lower mean amplitude of glucose excursions (0.34 [95% CI 
-0.57, -0.12] versus 0.05 [95% CI -0.20, 0.30] mmol/L); lower fasting peptide YY 
levels (-18.25 [95%CI -41.90, 5.41] versus 21.88 [95% CI -1.78, 45.53] pg/ml), 
and improved HOMA-IR (-0.51 [95% CI -0.98, -0.03] versus 0.28 [95% CI -0.20, 
0.76]). Our protocol increased TST and improved markers of metabolic health in 
male overweight/obese short sleepers.

AIM: Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment strategy in major depression. 
However, two-thirds of patients remain depressed after the initial 
antidepressant treatment. Augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
pharmacotherapy-resistant depression in primary mental health care settings 
proved effective and cost-effective. Although we reported the clinical 
effectiveness of augmented CBT in secondary mental health care, its 
cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of augmented CBT adjunctive to treatment as usual (TAU) and 
TAU alone for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression at secondary mental health 
care settings.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis at 64 weeks, alongside a 
randomized controlled trial involving 80 patients who sought depression 
treatment at a university hospital and psychiatric hospital (one each). The 
cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) that compared the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life years, 
and other clinical scales, between the groups.
RESULTS: The ICERs were JPY -15 278 322 and 2 026 865 for 
pharmacotherapy-resistant depression for all samples and those with 
moderate/severe symptoms at baseline, respectively. The acceptability curve 
demonstrates a 0.221 and 0.701 probability of the augmented CBT being 
cost-effective for all samples and moderate/severe depression, respectively, at 
the threshold of JPY 4.57 million (GBP 30 000). The sensitivity analysis 
supported the robustness of our results restricting for moderate/severe 
depression.
CONCLUSION: Augmented CBT for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression is not 
cost-effective for all samples including mild depression. In contrast, it 
appeared to be cost-effective for the patients currently manifesting 
moderate/severe symptoms under secondary mental health care.

The Teosinte branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating cell factor (TCP) transcription 
factors are potent growth and developmental regulators in plants, also 
responsive to various hormonal and environmental stimuli. In this study, we 
primarily focused on the functional role of TCP9, a nuclear-localised Class-I 
TCP transcription factor in a drought and heat-tolerant legume crop, cowpea 
(Vigna unguiculata). Under drought stress, a higher protein expression level of 
TCP9 was observed in the leaves of the drought-tolerant cowpea cultivar Pusa 
Komal as compared to the drought-sensitive cultivar TVu-7778. Further, 
overexpression of VuTCP9 resulted in reduced cell and stomata size, aperture 
length and width while cell and overall stomatal density in the 35S::VuTCP9 
transgenic cowpea lines increased. Phenotypic alterations, such as reduced leaf 
size and vigour, altered seed coats displaying extension pattern similar to the 
'Watson pattern' and delayed senescence were prominent in the transgenic lines. 
Under normal conditions, the gas exchange and fluorescence measurements 
indicated reduction in transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs ) and 
photosynthetic efficiency (Φ PSII). However, water usage efficiency (WUE) 
remained unaltered in the transgenic lines as compared to the wild-type (WT) 
plants. Furthermore, the transgenic lines displayed higher tolerance to 
oxidative, drought and salinity stress, maintained relatively higher relative 
water content and lower occurrence of H2 O2 , as compared to the WT plants. 
Genes related to the jasmonic acid biosynthesis, stomatal development and 
abiotic stress responsiveness, such as TTG1, NAC25, SPCH and GRP1, increased and 
LOX2 decreased significantly in the transgenic lines.

How Should Willingness-to-Pay Values of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years Be Updated 
and According to Whom?

Menzel PT(1).

Author information:
(1)Author of Strong Medicine: The Ethical Rationing of Health Care (Oxford 
University Press, 1990) and Prevention vs. Treatment: What's the Right Balance? 
(Oxford University Press, 2011).

Before updating any willingness-to-pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) threshold, a few points must be recognized. Ethical justification for 
using WTP thresholds and QALYs lies in incorporating the preferences of those 
whose treatment could be affected by resulting resource allocations. For WTP 
thresholds, such justification depends on the sufficiency of a match between a 
group-members of an insurance pool from which health care payments and services 
are drawn-and those whose health care is potentially affected. For QALYs, that 
justification depends on eliciting the right persons' preferences to inform 
quality-adjustment ratings; on balance it should be from those who have the 
conditions being rated. Because the value of simply being alive is not 
adequately accounted for, how life extension and quality improvement are 
combined in constructing the QALY is its most significant shortcoming as a 
measure. Although updating WTP thresholds might be better than not updating 
them, this manuscript suggests why drawing on a less fundamentally flawed 
concept than the conventional QALY is more important.

BACKGROUND: We surveyed evidence published by Ireland's National Centre for 
Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) on the cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs approved for 
funding within the Irish public healthcare system. The purpose is threefold: to 
assess the completeness and clarity of publicly available cost-effectiveness 
data of such therapies; to provide summary estimates of that data; to consider 
the implications of constraints on data availability for accountability 
regarding healthcare resource allocation.
METHODS: The National Cancer Control Programme lists 91 drug-indication pairs 
approved between June 2012 and July 2020. Records were retrieved from the NCPE 
website for each drug-indication pair, including, where available, health 
technology assessment (HTA) summary reports. We assessed what cost-effectiveness 
data regarding approved interventions is available, aggregated it and considered 
the consequences of reporting constraints.
RESULTS: Among the 91 drug-indication pairs 61 were reimbursed following full 
HTA, 22 after a rapid review process and 8 have no corresponding NCPE record. Of 
the 61 where an HTA report was available, 41 presented costs and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates of the interventions compared. Cost 
estimates and corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are 
based on prices on application for reimbursement. Reimbursed prices are not 
published. Aggregating over the drug-indication pairs for which data is 
available, we find a mean incremental health gain of 0.85 QALY and an aggregate 
ICER of €100,295/QALY, which exceeds Ireland's cost-effectiveness threshold of 
€45,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Reimbursement applications by pharmaceutical manufacturers for 
cancer drugs typically exceed Ireland's cost-effectiveness threshold, often by a 
considerable margin. On aggregate, the additional total net cost of new drugs 
relative to current treatments needs to be more than halved for the prices 
sought on application to be justified for reimbursement. Commercial 
confidentiality regarding prices and cost-effectiveness upon reimbursement 
compromises accountability regarding the fair and efficient allocation of scarce 
healthcare resources.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs 
docetaxel in advanced squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) following platinum-based chemotherapy from a US payer perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: Trial- and cohort-based cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: The analyses used partitioned survival models with 3 mutually exclusive 
health states: progression free, progressed disease, and death. The mean 
starting age was 61 years. Clinical parameters were derived from the 2 
registrational, randomized, phase 3 trials with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. 
Costs were derived from published literature. The primary outcomes were 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years gained (LYG), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per 
annum. Uncertainty was examined using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: In patients with squamous NSCLC, the use of nivolumab improved 
life-years (LYs) and QALYs by 1.23 and 0.99, respectively, compared with 
docetaxel. Costs were increased by $99,677, resulting in ICERs of $100,776 per 
QALY and $81,294 per LYG. In patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, nivolumab 
increased LYs and QALYs by 0.99 and 0.80, respectively. Costs were increased by 
$94,174, resulting in ICERs of $117,739 per QALY and $94,849 per LYG. ICERs were 
most sensitive to the discount rates applied to costs and outcomes. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000, nivolumab had probabilities of 91% and 
99% of being cost-effective in patients with squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is likely to be cost-effective for the treatment of 
patients with advanced NSCLC following platinum-based chemotherapy in the United 
States.

Drug-Related Problems on a Palliative Care Unit.

Rémi C, Bauer D, Krumm L, Bausewein C.

Pharmacotherapy is essential in palliative medicine. Besides potential benefits, 
pharmacotherapy also poses potential risks that need to be minimized for patient 
safety. Pharmacists can play an important role in identifying, solving, and 
avoiding drug-related problems (DRPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
pharmaceutical interventions on safety of drug therapy in patients in an 
inpatient palliative care unit. All patients admitted to a palliative care unit 
over a 12-month period were screened for eligibility (ie, life expectancy 
>4 weeks). To identify and assess DRPs, patients' pharmacotherapy was evaluated 
by a pharmacist according to various aspects (eg, drug selection, dose 
selection, or treatment duration according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network 
Europe classification for DRPs). During the 12-month period, 41 patients were 
included. Patients received a median of 11 (range, 1-22) different drugs. 
Overall, 207 DRPs were documented (median 5 DRPs/patient). After recording a 
DRP, the pharmacist directly intervened 290 times in order to solve the DRP, 
which was successful in 181/207 (88%). Clinically relevant DRPs are common in 
palliative medicine. The systematic assessment can support therapy decisions. 
This can result in optimized drug therapy, subsequently having a positive effect 
on symptom control and quality of life.

Marche, 60131 Ancona, Italy.

With the increase in life expectancy, one of the most important topic for 
scientific research, especially for the elderly, is good nutrition. In 
particular, with an advanced age and health issues because disorders such as 
Alzheimer and dementia, monitoring the subjects' dietary habits to avoid 
excessive or poor nutrition is a critical role. Starting from an application 
aiming to monitor the food intake actions of people during a meal, already shown 
in a previously published paper, the present work describes some improvements 
that are able to make the application work in real time. The considered solution 
exploits the Kinect v1 device that can be installed on the ceiling, in a 
top-down view in an effort to preserve privacy of the subjects. The food intake 
actions are estimated from the analysis of depth frames. The innovations 
introduced in this document are related to the automatic identification of the 
initial and final frame for the detection of food intake actions, and to the 
strong revision of the procedure to identify food intake actions with respect to 
the original work, in order to optimize the performance of the algorithm. 
Evaluation of the computational effort and system performance compared to the 
previous version of the application has demonstrated a possible real-time 
applicability of the solution presented in this document.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiometabolic syndromes are the most common causes of 
complications shortening life expectancy in patients treated for mental 
disorders, especially schizophrenia. However, how much cardiometabolic risk is 
related to lifestyle, side-effects of treatment or psychosis is not clear. The 
aim of this study was a prospective assessment of metabolic changes in young, 
initially somatically healthy patients diagnosed with the first acute episode of 
psychosis with no prior pharmacological treatment.
METHODS: The study involved 15 young patients (average age of 19.95 ± 6.88 
years). Analyses (laboratory and clinical) were performed at the time of 
admission and after 3 and 12 weeks and included morphology, lipid profile, 
glucose, inflammation markers, blood pressure (BP), and body mass index (BMI). 
The severity of clinical symptoms was assessed using the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the cognitive functioning was assessed using the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) 
was also measured.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase in BMI, dyslipidemia, inflammation, 
and systolic blood pressure after 12 weeks from the start of the treatment, 
while cortisol level decreased. A negative correlation was observed between 
PANSS-P (PANSS positivescale) measurements and total cholesterol, PANSS total 
and low-density lipoprotein, as well as DUPand MoCA. High-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) correlated positively with DUP, cortisol, monocytes, and white blood cells 
in the first week.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate a relationship between the 
development and treatment of the first acute episode of psychosis and the 
results of laboratory tests that are indicators of the development of metabolic 
stress in patients.

BACKGROUND: Active commuting as a contributor to daily physical activity is 
beneficial for cardiovascular health, but leads to more chances of exposure to 
ambient air pollution. This study aimed to investigate associations between 
active commuting to work with cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality and life 
expectancy among general Chinese adults, and to further evaluate the 
modification effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on these 
associations.
METHODS: We included 76,176 Chinese adults without CVD from three large cohorts 
of the Prediction for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk in China 
project. Information about commuting mode and physical activity were collected 
by unified questionnaire. Satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations at 1-km spatial 
resolution was used for estimating PM2.5 exposure of participants. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD incidence, mortality and 
all-cause mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression 
models. Multiplicative interaction term of commuting mode and PM2.5 level was 
tested to investigate potential effect modification.
RESULTS: During 448,499 person-years of follow-up, 2230 CVD events and 2777 
all-cause deaths were recorded. Compared with the non-active commuters, the 
multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of CVD incidence and all-cause mortality 
were 0.95(0.85-1.05) and 0.79(0.72-0.87) for walking commuters, respectively. 
Corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for cycling commuters were 0.71(0.62-0.82) and 
0.67(0.59-0.76). Active commuters over 45 years old were estimated to have more 
CVD-free years and life expectancy than non-active commuters under lower PM2.5 
concentration. However, these beneficial effects of active commuting were 
alleviated or counteracted by long-term exposure to high PM2.5 concentration. 
Significant multiplicative interaction of commuting mode and PM2.5 level was 
showed in all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk observed in cycling 
participants exposed to lower level of PM2.5.
CONCLUSIONS: Active commuting was associated with lower risk of CVD, all-cause 
mortality, and longer life expectancy among Chinese adults under ambient 
settings with lower PM2.5 level. It will be valuable to encourage active 
commuting among adults and develop stringent strategies on ambient PM2.5 
pollution control for prevention of CVD and prolongation of life expectancy.

Prolonged life expectancy and stressful lifestyles have increased the risk of 
developing neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative and psychiatric 
illnesses. Despite obvious and immediate needs for effective treatment, drug 
discovery for neurological disorders has been largely serendipitous, whereas 
hypothesis-driven drug development programs have been remarkably poor. This may 
be partly due to insufficient knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying 
disease pathophysiology, complex genetic and environmental risk factors, and 
oversimplified diagnostic criteria. Here, we review recent progress in cell 
type-specific investigations, bioinformatics analyses, and large reference 
databases, the integration of which, when combined with effective use of animal 
models, provides novel insights into disease mechanisms, suggests innovative 
drug development, and ultimately promises superior treatments for patients 
suffering from neurological disorders.

Hospital, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.

INTRODUCTION: Newly developed anti-diabetic medications have had multiple 
activities, beyond a blood glucose-lowering effect. Current drugs for treating 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are based on the use of gastrointestinal 
hormones. Representative incretin preparations, such as those with glucagon-like 
peptide (GLP)-1 or gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) activity, aim to provide 
new means of controlling blood glucose levels, body weight, and lipid 
metabolism.
In this manuscript, the pathophysiology of T2DM and the activities and 
characteristics of novel diabetic drugs are reviewed in the context of the 
Japanese population. This review also highlights the need for novel medicines to 
overcome the accompanying challenges. Finally, the author provides the reader 
with their expert perspectives.
The incidence of T2DM has been increasing in the aging of Japanese society. In 
older people, medical development should focus on safety, easier 
self-administration, and the relief of caregiver burden in terms of continuous 
administration. In the young, the focus should be on effectiveness, with a 
particular emphasis on the protection of organs, increasing the ease of 
adherence, and safety. Novel medicines will need to push the envelope in these 
areas.

BACKGROUND: With trends towards longer life expectancy, lifetime with disability 
has also been prolonged. It is increasingly recognized that not only the person 
with disability but also those around them are affected. The relationship 
between functional limitation (FL) of the older adults and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) of their spouse is of interest. So too is the 
determination of the factors aside from FL that influence HRQoL.
METHODS: The sample was derived from the 2013 National Health Service Survey 
conducted in Shaanxi Province in China. Married couples aged ≥ 60 years were 
selected (n = 3463). The European quality of life five dimensions (EQ-5D) and 
visual analogue scale were used to measure HRQoL.
RESULTS: Both wife and husband reported lower HRQoL if either the male or female 
partner had some or serious FLs (P < 0.001). Other factors associated with lower 
HRQoL of the spouse included age, lower educational level, presence of chronic 
disease, and lower household economic status. Family size was associated with 
wife's HRQoL only when the male had no FL and lived with another 1-2 persons, or 
when the male had some FLs and lived in a larger family (n ≥ 5). Residential 
status did not relate to the HRQoL of spouses regardless of FL status.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults in Shaanxi province who have partners with FLs tend to 
report poorer EQ-5D, suggesting that couples amongst whom one has FL may be 
particularly vulnerable to lower HRQoL.

Iatrogenic causes of male infertility can include medications, chemotherapy, 
radiation, and surgery. In this review, we discuss commonly performed urologic 
cancer surgeries and nonurologic surgeries that harbor a high risk of iatrogenic 
infertility. These include radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, 
retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, pelvic colon surgery, and anterior spine 
surgery. In addition, we review the anatomy and surgical strategies that help to 
reduce the risks of infertility. With an increase in life expectancy and 
improvements in fertility preservation, it is important to properly counsel 
patients about the risks of infertility and provide options for fertility 
preservation before surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To update the life expectancy estimates according to age, sex, 
mobility, and feeding skills reported in the 2015 study of Brooks et al. To 
examine trends in survival over the past decade.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Poisson regression and life table analysis applied to long-term 
follow-up data on United States (US) Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model Systems 
patients recorded in the national database. Functional mobility and feeding 
skills were assessed with FIM.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,803 persons with TBI during the years 1988-2019 who 
underwent inpatient rehabilitation and provided at least 1 long-term assessment 
of functional skills 1 year or more postinjury (N=14,803).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, mortality rates, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was lower than that of the age- and sex-matched general 
population. Older age and severity of functional impairments were risk factors 
for mortality (both P<.0001 in regression models). Among ambulatory individuals, 
mortality was 51% (95% confidence interval, 35%-69%) higher in men than women. 
Life expectancy of 20-year-old women who walked well (FIM ambulation score 7) 
was 55 (SE=0.8) additional years to age 75, representing a reduction of 6.9 
years from the normal general population figure. For 20-year-old men who walked 
well, the life expectancy was 49 (SE=0.5) additional years, representing a 
reduction of 8.1 years from normal. Life expectancies for men and women who did 
not walk and were fed by others were much lower. There was no significant change 
in mortality rates during the study period (hazard ratio, 1.008; P=.07).
CONCLUSIONS: There has been no significant change in the long-term survival of 
persons with TBI in the US since the late 1980s. The life expectancies reported 
here are similar to those reported in the 2015 study of Brooks et al, although 
they are more precise because of the larger sample size and longer follow-up.

With the rising life expectancy and availability of neuroimaging, increased 
number of older patients will present with diffuse and anaplastic gliomas. The 
aim of our study was therefore to investigate age-related prognostic clinical, 
neuropathological and radiological features of lower-grade gliomas. All 
consecutive patients with diffuse or anaplastic glioma WHO grade 2 and 3 who 
underwent first tumor resection between 2010 and 2018, were selected from the 
institutional neuro-oncological database and evaluated. The mean age of 55 males 
and 44 females was 46 years (SD ± 16). Wild-type IDH1 (p = 0.012), persistent 
nuclear ATRX expression (p = 0.012) and anaplasia (p < 0.001) were significantly 
associated with higher age. The CE volume before resection was found to be 
increased in older patients (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001), and CE rate was higher in 
the IDH wild-type population only (p = 0.02). The extent of resection did not 
differ with age. Overall, one year of life resulted in a PFS reduction of 9 days 
(p = 0.047); in IDH sub-group analysis, this dependency was confirmed only in 
wild-type tumors (p = 0.05). OS was significantly reduced in older patients 
(p = 0.033). In conclusion, behavior and prognosis of WHO grade 2 and 3 glioma 
were unfavorable in correlation to patient's age, even if the extent of 
resection was comparable. Older age imparted a poorer PFS and higher CE rate 
only in the IDH wild-type population.

Giant Ovarian Thecoma Associated with Meigs Syndrome: A Striking Case.

Dellaportas D, Kollia D, Myoteri D, Nastos C, Gkiokas G, Carvounis E, 
Theodosopoulos T.

Introduction: Meigs syndrome consists of the presence of a benign ovarian tumor, 
ascites and pleural effusion, and the latter two subdued after surgical excision 
of the ovarian tumor. Elevated Ca-125 in this context is confusing and is 
reported only in a handful of cases. A rare but striking case with the above 
features is presented herein. Case Presentation: A 46-year-old woman with a 
giant pelvic/abdominal mass originating from her right adnexa, ascites and 
pleural effusion, with elevated Ca-125 (938 IU/mL) was treated with the 
presumptive diagnosis of stage IV ovarian cancer. Imaging modalities showed a 22 
cm solid adnexal mass and the patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and 
bilateral salpigooophorectomy, omentectomy and drainage of 4L of ascetic fluid. 
Surprisingly, final histopathology was negative for malignancy, characterizing 
the primary tumor as ovarian thecoma. Ascites and pleural effusion resolved by 
the seventh postoperative day, setting the diagnosis of Meigs syndrome. 
Discussion: Meigs syndrome accounts for 1% of all ovarian tumors, however it 
should be considered in the differential diagnosis when clinicians come across 
the classic triad of the syndrome, even when Ca-125 is elevated. These patients 
have normal life expectancy with meticulous management, while pathophysiology of 
this condition remains uncertain in various points.
