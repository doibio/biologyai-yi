BACKGROUND: London has outperformed smaller towns and rural areas in terms of 
life expectancy increase. Our aim was to investigate life expectancy change at 
very-small-area level, and its relationship with house prices and their change.
METHODS: We performed a hyper-resolution spatiotemporal analysis from 2002 to 
2019 for 4835 London Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs). We used population 
and death counts in a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate age- and 
sex-specific death rates for each LSOA, converted to life expectancy at birth 
using life table methods. We used data from the Land Registry via the real 
estate website Rightmove (www.rightmove.co.uk), with information on property 
size, type and land tenure in a hierarchical model to estimate house prices at 
LSOA level. We used linear regressions to summarise how much life expectancy 
changed in relation to the combination of house prices in 2002 and their change 
from 2002 to 2019. We calculated the correlation between change in price and 
change in sociodemographic characteristics of the resident population of LSOAs 
and population turnover.
FINDINGS: In 134 (2.8%) of London's LSOAs for women and 32 (0.7%) for men, life 
expectancy may have declined from 2002 to 2019, with a posterior probability of 
a decline >80% in 41 (0.8%, women) and 14 (0.3%, men) LSOAs. The life expectancy 
increase in other LSOAs ranged from <2 years in 537 (11.1%) LSOAs for women and 
214 (4.4%) for men to >10 years in 220 (4.6%) for women and 211 (4.4%) for men. 
The 2.5th-97.5th-percentile life expectancy difference across LSOAs increased 
from 11.1 (10.7-11.5) years in 2002 to 19.1 (18.4-19.7) years for women in 2019, 
and from 11.6 (11.3-12.0) years to 17.2 (16.7-17.8) years for men. In the 20% 
(men) and 30% (women) of LSOAs where house prices had been lowest in 2002, 
mainly in east and outer west London, life expectancy increased only in 
proportion to the rise in house prices. In contrast, in the 30% (men) and 60% 
(women) most expensive LSOAs in 2002, life expectancy increased solely 
independently of price change. Except for the 20% of LSOAs that had been most 
expensive in 2002, LSOAs with larger house price increases experienced larger 
growth in their population, especially among people of working ages (30-69 
years), had a larger share of households who had not lived there in 2002, and 
improved their rankings in education, poverty and employment.
INTERPRETATION: Large gains in area life expectancy in London occurred either 
where house prices were already high, or in areas where house prices grew the 
most. In the latter group, the increases in life expectancy may be driven, in 
part, by changing population demographics.

BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an 
effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The long-term benefit in PD 
patients with STN-DBS in comparison to medical treatment (MT) alone has not yet 
been demonstrated conclusively.
OBJECTIVES: To judge the long-term outcome of patients with STN-DBS.
METHODS: To assess the evolution of PD symptoms and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, we conducted a 
cross-sectional analysis of 115 patients with STN-DBS with rater-based scales 
and self-reported questionnaires. In addition, we screened records of all our 
STN-DBS patients (2001-2019, n = 162 patients) for the onset of the morbidity 
milestones (falls, hallucinations, dementia, and nursing home placement) to 
assess disability-free life expectancy.
RESULTS: In the first year of STN-DBS, levodopa equivalent dose was reduced and 
motor function improved. Nonmotor symptoms and cognition remained stable. These 
effects were similar to previous studies. Morbidity milestones occurred 
13 ± 7 years after diagnosis. Motor function, cognition, and HRQoL significantly 
worsened after the occurrence of any milestone, confirming the clinical 
relevance of these milestones. After onset of the first milestone, mean survival 
time was limited to 5 ± 0.8 years, which is comparable with patients with PD but 
without STN-DBS.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, PD patients with STN-DBS live with their disease for a 
longer time, and morbidity milestones occur later in the disease course than in 
PD patients with MT. As judged by morbidity milestones, morbidity remains 
compressed into the final 5 years of life in PD patients with STN-DBS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Histopathological features and molecular biomarkers 
have been studied as potential prognostic factors. This study aimed to 
investigate the clinical features, molecular phenotypes, and survival prognosis 
of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant (IDHmt) gliomas with histone H3 
alterations (H3-alterations).
METHODS: A total of 236 and 657 patients with whole-exome sequencing data were 
separately collected from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas databases. Survival analysis of patients with glioma was performed using 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by histone H3 status. Univariate and 
multivariate analyses were used to identify the associations between histone H3 
status and other clinicopathological factors with survival in patients with 
IDH-mutant gliomas.
RESULTS: Diffuse gliomas with H3 alterations are more likely to be high grade in 
2 cohorts ( P = .025 and P = .021, respectively). IDHmt glioma patients with 
H3-alteration had significantly less life expectancy than histone H3 wild-type ( 
P = .041 and P = .008, respectively). In the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas cohort, 
Karnofsky performance scores ≤ 80 (HR 2.394, 95% CI 1.257-4.559, P = .008), 
extent of resection (HR 0.971, 95% CI 0.957-0.986, P < .001), high WHO grade (HR 
6.938, 95% CI 2.787-17.269, P < .001), H3-alteration (HR 2.482, 95% CI 
1.183-4.981, P = .016), and 1p/19q codeletion (HR 0.169, 95% CI 0.073-0.390, P < 
.001) were independently associated with IDHmt gliomas. In the The Cancer Genome 
Atlas cohort, age (HR 1.034, 95% CI 1.008-1.061, P = .010), high WHO grade (HR 
2.365, 95% CI 1.263-4.427, P = .007), and H3-alteration (HR 2.501, 95% CI 
1.312-4.766, P = .005) were independently associated with IDHmt gliomas.
CONCLUSION: Identification and assessment of histone H3 status in clinical 
practice might help improve prognostic prediction and develop therapeutic 
strategies for these patient subgroups.

OBJECTIVE: To model the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of potential 
cord blood therapy in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
STUDY DESIGN: Markov microsimulation of ASD over the lifespan was used to 
compare two strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC), including behavioral and 
educational interventions, and 2) novel cord blood (CB) intervention in addition 
to SOC. Input data reflecting behavioral outcomes included baseline Vineland 
Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-3), monthly VABS-3 changes, and CB intervention 
efficacy on adaptive behavior based on a randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
(DukeACT). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were correlated to VABS-3. Costs 
for children with ASD ($15,791, ages 2-17 years) and adults with ASD ($56,559, 
ages 18+ years), and the CB intervention (range $15,000-45,000) were 
incorporated. Alternative CB efficacy and costs were explored.
RESULTS: We compared model-projected results to published data on 
life-expectancy, mean VABS-3 changes, and lifetime costs. Undiscounted lifetime 
QALYs in the SOC and CB strategies were 40.75 and 40.91. Discounted lifetime 
costs in the SOC strategy were $1,014,000, and for CB ranged from 
$1,021,000-$1,058,000 with CB intervention cost ($8,000-$45,000). At $15,000 
cost, CB was borderline cost-effective (ICER = $105,000/QALY). In one-way 
sensitivity analysis, CB cost and efficacy were the most influential parameters 
on CB ICER. CB intervention was cost-effective at costs<$15,000 and efficacies 
≥2.0. Five-year healthcare payer projected budgetary outlays at a $15,000 CB 
cost were $3.847B.
CONCLUSIONS: A modestly effective intervention designed to improve adaptive 
behavior in autism can be cost-effective under certain circumstances. 
Intervention cost and efficacy most affected the cost-effectiveness results and 
should be targeted to increase economic efficiency.

PREMISE: Many flowering plants depend on insects for pollination and thus 
attract pollinators by offering rewards, mostly nectar and pollen. Bee 
pollinators rely on pollen as their main nutrient source. Pollen provides all 
essential micro- and macronutrients including substances that cannot be 
synthesized by bees themselves, such as sterols, which bees need for processes 
such as hormone production. Variations in sterol concentrations may consequently 
affect bee health and reproductive fitness. We therefore hypothesized that (1) 
these variations in pollen sterols affect longevity and reproduction in bumble 
bees and (2) can thus be perceived via the bees' antennae before consumption.
METHODS: We studied the effect of sterols on longevity and reproduction of 
Bombus terrestris workers in feeding experiments and investigated sterol 
perception using chemotactile proboscis extension response (PER) conditioning.
RESULTS: Workers could perceive several sterols (cholesterol, cholestenone, 
desmosterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol) via their antennae but not 
differentiate between them. However, when sterols were presented in pollen, and 
not as a single compound, the bees were unable to differentiate between pollen 
differing in sterol content. Additionally, different sterol concentrations in 
pollen neither affected pollen consumption nor brood development or worker 
longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: Since we used both natural concentrations and concentrations higher 
than those found in pollen, our results indicate that bumble bees may not need 
to pay specific attention to pollen sterol content beyond a specific threshold. 
Naturally encountered concentrations might fully support their sterol 
requirements and higher concentrations do not seem to have negative effects.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of menu calorie labelling on reducing 
obesity-associated cancer burdens in the USA.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov cohort state-transition 
model.
SETTING: Policy intervention.
PARTICIPANTS: A modelled population of 235 million adults aged ≥20 years in 
2015-2016.
INTERVENTIONS: The impact of menu calorie labelling on reducing 13 
obesity-associated cancers among US adults over a lifetime was evaluated for: 
(1) effects on consumer behaviours; and (2) additional effects on industry 
reformulation. The model integrated nationally representative demographics, 
calorie intake from restaurants, cancer statistics and estimates on associations 
of policy with calorie intake, dietary change with body mass index (BMI) change, 
BMI with cancer rates, and policy and healthcare costs from published 
literature.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Averted new cancer cases and cancer deaths and net costs 
(in 2015 US$) among the total population and demographic subgroups were 
determined. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from societal and healthcare 
perspectives were assessed and compared with the threshold of US$150 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
incorporated uncertainty in input parameters and generated 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: Considering consumer behaviour alone, this policy was associated with 
28 000 (95% UI 16 300 to 39 100) new cancer cases and 16 700 (9610 to 23 600) 
cancer deaths averted, 111 000 (64 800 to 158 000) QALYs gained, and US$1480 
(884 to 2080) million saved in cancer-related medical costs among US adults. The 
policy was associated with net cost savings of US$1460 (864 to 2060) million and 
US$1350 (486 to 2260) million from healthcare and societal perspectives, 
respectively. Additional industry reformulation would substantially increase 
policy impact. Greater health gains and cost savings were predicted among young 
adults, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that menu calorie labelling is associated 
with lower obesity-related cancer burdens and reduced healthcare costs. 
Policymakers may prioritise nutrition policies for cancer prevention in the USA.

The effect of medical innovation on the cost-effectiveness of Covid 19-related 
policies in the United States using a SIR model.

BACKGROUND: During 2020-21, the United States used a multifaceted approach to 
control SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) and reduce mortality and morbidity. This included 
non-medical interventions (NMIs), aggressive vaccine development and deployment, 
and research into more effective approaches to medically treat Covid-19. Each 
approach had both costs and benefits. The objective of this study was to 
calculate the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for three major 
Covid-19 policies: NMIs, vaccine development and deployment (Vaccines), and 
therapeutics and care improvements within the hospital setting (HTCI).
METHODS: To simulate the number of QALYs lost per scenario, we developed a 
multi-risk Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model where infection and 
fatality rates vary between regions. We use a two equation SIR model. The first 
equation represents changes in the number of infections and is a function of the 
susceptible population, the infection rate and the recovery rate. The second 
equation shows the changes in the susceptible population as people recover. Key 
costs included loss of economic productivity, reduced future earnings due to 
educational closures, inpatient spending and the cost of vaccine development. 
Benefits included reductions in Covid-19 related deaths, which were offset in 
some models by additional cancer deaths due to care delays.
RESULTS: The largest cost is the reduction in economic output associated with 
NMI ($1.7 trillion); the second most significant cost is the educational 
shutdowns, with estimated reduced lifetime earnings of $523B. The total 
estimated cost of vaccine development is $55B. HTCI had the lowest cost per QALY 
gained vs "do nothing" with a cost of $2,089 per QALY gained. Vaccines cost 
$34,777 per QALY gained in isolation, while NMIs alone were dominated by other 
options. HTCI alone dominated most alternatives, except the combination of HTCI 
and Vaccines ($58,528 per QALY gained) and HTCI, Vaccines and NMIs ($3.4 m per 
QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: HTCI was the most cost effective and was well justified under any 
standard cost effectiveness threshold. The cost per QALY gained for vaccine 
development, either alone or in concert with other approaches, is well within 
the standard for cost effectiveness. NMIs reduced deaths and saved QALYs, but 
the cost per QALY gained is well outside the usual accepted limits.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Egypt used to have one of the highest prevalences of HCV 
infection worldwide. The Egyptian Ministry of Health launched a national 
campaign for the detection and management of HCV to reduce its burden. This 
study aims to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the costs and 
benefits of the Egyptian national screening and treatment programme.
METHODS: A disease burden and economic impact model was populated with the 
Egyptian national screening and treatment programme data to assess direct 
medical costs, health effects measured in disability-adjusted life years and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The scenario was compared to a historical 
base case, which assumed that no programme had been conducted.
RESULTS: Total number of viremic cases is expected to decrease in 2030 by 86% 
under the national screening and treatment programme, versus by 41% under the 
historical base case. Annual discounted direct medical costs are expected to 
decrease from $178 million in 2018 to $81 million by 2030 under the historical 
base case, while annual direct medical costs are estimated to have peaked in 
2019 at $312 million before declining to $55 million by 2030 under the national 
screening and treatment programme. Under the programme, annual 
disability-adjusted life years are expected to decline to 127 647 by 2030, 
leading to 883 333 cumulative disability-adjusted life years averted over 
2018-2030.
CONCLUSIONS: The national screening and treatment programme is highly 
cost-effective by the year 2021, cost-saving by 2029 and expected to save about 
$35 million in direct costs and $4705 million in indirect costs by 2030.

Diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is often challenging, delayed, or even missed due 
to the uncommonness of the disease, and it can lead to devastating consequences. 
Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed for prompt diagnosis and improved 
long-term outcomes. Vertebral osteomyelitis, or spondylodiscitis, is a rare 
disease with increasing prevalence due to advanced spinal surgical procedures, 
nosocomial bacteremia, increased life expectancy, and intravenous drug use. 
Hematogenous infection is the most common cause of spondylodiscitis. We report a 
case of a 63-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis who initially 
presented due to abdominal distension. During his hospital stay, he complained 
of uncontrolled back pain due to Escherichia coli spondylodiscitis.

Cashew apples, tropical pseudo fruit, are rich in bioactive compounds. It is 
still underutilized due to its high perishability and its astringent flavor. 
This study aims to extend its shelf life by chemical dip and dry method at the 
rural level. Inhibition of fruit-spoiling enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase 
(PPO), peroxidase (POD), amylase, and cellulase, was a significant response in 
this method. Enzyme inhibition was carried out using chemicals: NaCl (1-10 mM), 
CaCl2 (1-10 mM), and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (0.1-1 mM). The effect of 
chemical concentration and dipping time was studied using a full factorial 
method at three levels (-1, 0, and 1). The dipping time ranged from 60 to 
180 min, and chemical concentrations from 1 to 10 mM were studied. Optimal 
treatment conditions were obtained as follows: NaCl concentration of 9.45 mM, 
dipping time of 160 min, and CaCl2 concentration of 7.8 mM, dipping time of 
160 min. NaCl pretreatment showed maximum inhibition of PPO (>80%) and POD 
(>80%), whereas CaCl2 pretreatment showed maximum inhibition of amylase (60.58%) 
and cellulase (80.23%). Hence, to avoid postharvest losses, pretreatment with 
NaCl and CaCl2 was adequate to preserve the texture and color of cashew apples. 
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Chemical pretreatment can prevent the postharvest losses 
of cashew apples. Inhibition of PPO, POD, amylase, and cellulase is vital in the 
shelf-life extension of cashew apples. Sodium chloride dip is a cost-effective 
method for increasing the storability of cashew apples.

INTRODUCTION: This physician-initiated study provides 5-year (i.e., long-term) 
treatment durability data from 3 top recruitment sites that participated in the 
prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-arm VBX FLEX clinical study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02080871). It evaluates the long-term 
treatment durability of the GORE VIABAHN VBX Balloon Expandable Endoprosthesis 
(VBX Stent-Graft) in the treatment of subjects with de novo or restenotic 
aortoiliac lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 59 subjects with 94 treated lesions were 
enrolled at the 3 participating sites from the original 140 intent-to-treat 
subjects in the VBX FLEX study. The primary durability endpoint was long-term 
primary patency. Secondary long-term outcomes included freedom from target 
lesion revascularization (TLR), freedom from target vessel revascularization 
(TVR), as well as resting ankle-brachial index (ABI), Rutherford category, 
EuroQol 5 Dimensions, and Walking Impairment status.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine subjects participated and twenty-eight (47.5%) were 
available through the end of the study at 5-year follow-up (the median follow-up 
time was 6.6 years due to complications resulting from COVID-19 precautions). At 
3 and 5 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from all-cause mortality 
were 94.5% and 81.7%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for primary 
patency at 3 and 5 years were 94.0% and 89.5% (by lesion) and 91.7% and 84.4% 
(by subject). Primary assisted patency at 3 and 5 years were 93.3% and 93.3%. 
Kaplan-Meier estimate for freedom from TLR at 5 years was 89.1%. The majority of 
subjects were asymptomatic (Rutherford category 0) at 3 years (29/59; 72%), and 
at 5-year follow-up (18/28; 64%). The 5-year mean resting ankle-brachial index 
was 0.95±0.18, an improvement of 0.15±0.26 from the baseline (p<0.001). Quality 
of life measures also showed sustained improvement through long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The 5-year long-term follow-up data underscore the robustness and 
durability of the Viabahn Balloon-Expandable Endoprosthesis for treating 
aortoiliac occlusive disease.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Durable improvement after endovascular treatment of iliac 
occlusive disease is clinically important because many of these patients are 
claudicants with significant life expectancy. This study is the first to 
evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients with iliac occlusive disease treated 
with the Viabahn VBX balloon-expandable endopirostheses. The study reports 
excellent long-term patency outcomes with prolonged clinical benefit. These 
durable results are likely to be an important consideration for clinicians 
undertaking iliac artery revascularization procedures.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the survival rate in the 
middle-aged patient group up to 65 years old and to compare it with other age 
groups of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for knee 
osteoarthritis (OA).
DESIGN: The Register of Orthopaedic Prosthetic Implants (RIPO) regional registry 
was used to analyze the results of patients <80 years old affected by primary OA 
and treated with TKA from 2000 to 2019. The database was investigated according 
to the age group: younger than 50 years, 50-65 years, or 66-79 years, with the 
aim to estimate revision surgeries and implant survivorship.
RESULTS: A total of 45,488 TKAs for primary OA were included in the analysis (M: 
11,388; F: 27,846). The percentage of patients <65 years old increased from 
13.5% to 24.8% between 2000 and 2019 (P < 0.0001). The survival analysis showed 
an overall influence of age on the implant revision rate (P < 0.0001), with an 
estimated survival rate of 78.7%, 89.4%, and 94.8% at 15 years in the 3 groups, 
respectively. Compared with the older-aged group, the relative risk of failure 
was 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-4.3; P < 0.001) higher in patients 
<50 years old and 1.8 (95% CI = 1.6-2.0; P < 0.001) higher in patients 50-65 
years old.
CONCLUSIONS: TKA use in the middle-aged patient population up to 65 years old 
increased significantly over time. These patients present a double risk of 
failure with respect to older patients. This is particularly important 
considering the increasing life expectancy and the emergence of new joint 
preserving strategies, which could postpone the need for TKA to an older age.

IL-12 is a pleotropic inflammatory cytokine, which has broad stimulatory effects 
on various immune cell populations, making it an attractive target for cancer 
immunotherapy. However, despite generating robust antitumor activity in 
syngeneic murine tumor models, clinical administration of IL-12 has been limited 
by severe toxicity. mWTX-330 is a selectively inducible INDUKINE molecule 
comprised of a half-life extension domain and an inactivation domain linked to 
chimeric IL-12 by tumor protease-sensitive linkers. Systemic administration of 
mWTX-330 in mice was well tolerated, resulted in robust antitumor immunity in 
multiple tumor models, and preferentially activated tumor-infiltrating immune 
cells rather than immune cells present in peripheral tissues. Antitumor activity 
was dependent on in vivo processing of the protease cleavable linkers and 
required CD8+ T cells for full efficacy. Within the tumor, mWTX-330 increased 
the frequency of cross-presenting dendritic cells (DC), activated natural killer 
(NK) cells, skewed conventional CD4+ T cells toward a T helper 1 (TH1) 
phenotype, drove regulatory T cells (Treg) fragility, and increased the 
frequency of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. mWTX-330 treatment also increased the 
clonality of tumor-infiltrating T cells by expanding underrepresented T-cell 
receptor (TCR) clones, drove CD8+ T and NK cells towards increased mitochondrial 
respiration and fitness, and decreased the frequency of TOX+ exhausted CD8+ T 
cells within the tumor. A fully human version of this INDUKINE molecule was 
stable in human serum, was reliably and selectively processed by human tumor 
samples, and is currently in clinical development.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness is important in the prioritisation between 
interventions in health care. Exercise is cost-effective compared to usual care 
during oncological treatment; however, the significance of exercise intensity to 
the cost-effectiveness is unclear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate 
the long-term cost-effectiveness of the randomised controlled trial Phys-Can, a 
six-month exercise programme of high (HI) or low-to-moderate intensity (LMI) 
during (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, based on 189 participants 
with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (HI: n = 99 and LMI: n = 90) from 
the Phys-Can RCT in Sweden. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective, 
and included cost of the exercise intervention, health care utilisation and 
productivity loss. Health outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), using EQ-5D-5L at baseline, post intervention and 12 months after the 
completion of the intervention.
RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up after the intervention, the total cost per 
participant did not differ significantly between HI (€27,314) and LMI exercise 
(€29,788). There was no significant difference in health outcome between the 
intensity groups. On average HI generated 1.190 QALYs and LMI 1.185 QALYs. The 
mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that HI was cost effective 
compared with LMI, but the uncertainty was large.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HI and LMI exercise have similar costs and effects 
during oncological treatment. Hence, based on cost-effectiveness, we suggest 
that decision makers and clinicians can consider implementing both HI and LMI 
exercise programmes and recommend either intensity to the patients with cancer 
during oncological treatment to facilitate improvement of health.

Important differences in health that are closely linked with social disadvantage 
exist within and between countries. According to the World Health Organization, 
life expectancy and good health continue to increase in many parts of the world, 
but fail to improve in other parts of the world, indicating that differences in 
life expectancy and health arise due to the circumstances in which people grow, 
live, work, and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. 
Marginalized communities experience higher rates of certain diseases and more 
deaths compared to the general population, indicating a profound disparity in 
health status. Although several factors place marginalized communities at high 
risk for poor health outcomes, one important factor is exposure to air 
pollutants. Marginalized communities and minorities are exposed to higher levels 
of air pollutants than the majority population. Interestingly, a link exists 
between air pollutant exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes, suggesting 
that marginalized communities may have increased reproductive disorders due to 
increased exposure to air pollutants compared to the general population. This 
review summarizes different studies showing that marginalized communities have 
higher exposure to air pollutants, the types of air pollutants present in our 
environment, and the associations between air pollution and adverse reproductive 
outcomes, focusing on marginalized communities.

There has been a longstanding debate about the impact of international trade on 
the environment and human well-being, yet there is little known about such 
environment and human well-being trade-off. Here, we explore the effect of 
international trade on the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB) globally 
under the current global trade system and a hypothetical no-trade scenario. We 
found that between 1995 and 2015, CIWB of 41% of countries declined and 59% of 
countries increased, caused by international trade, and this resulted in a 
reduction of the global CIWB and a decline in CIWB inequality between countries. 
International trade decreased CIWB for high- and upper-middle-income countries 
and increased CIWB for lower- and middle-income countries. In addition, our 
results also show that decreases in emission intensity are the most important 
driver of lower CIWB and the percentage contribution of emission intensity to 
the improvement in CIWB increases with income. The reduction of emission 
intensity, population growth, and increase in life expectancy all contribute to 
CIWB reduction, while the consumption level is the primary factor driving CIWB 
growth. Our results underscore the importance of studying the impact of 
international trade on the CIWB of countries at different stages of development.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric maxillofacial trauma has become an increasingly pressing 
clinical issue in Taiwan because of increased life expectancy.
AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to investigate the 
anthropometric changes and the posttrauma outcomes in the aging population and 
to optimize the management strategies for geriatric facial fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2015 to 2020, a total of 30 patients 65 years or 
older were identified to have suffered from maxillofacial fractures and 
presented at the emergency department of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital 
(CGMH). These patients were categorized into group III, representing the elderly 
group. Two other groups (group I, age 18-40 years; group II, age 41-64 years) of 
patients were categorized based on their age. After applying propensity score 
matching to reduce bias caused by a large case number difference, patient 
demographics, anthropometric data, and management methods were compared and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 30 patients 65 years or older who met the inclusion criteria, the 
mean age of the matched group III was 77.31 ± 14.87 years, and the mean number 
of retained teeth was 11.77 (range, 3-20 teeth). The elderly patients had a 
significantly lower number of retained teeth (group I vs group II vs group III, 
27.3 vs 25.23 vs 11.77; P < 0.001). Anthropometric data showed that facial bone 
structure degenerated significantly with advancing age. Outcome analysis 
demonstrated that falls accounted for 43.3% of injury mechanisms in the elderly 
group, followed by motorcycle accidents (30%) and car accidents (23.3%). 
Nineteen elderly patients (63%) received nonsurgical management. On the other 
hand, 86.7% of cases in the other 2 age groups underwent surgery. The average 
numbers of total hospital and intensive care unit stays in group III patients 
were 16.9 (range, 3-49 days) and 4.57 (range, 0-47 days), which was 
significantly longer than the other 2 age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that not only surgery is feasible for elderly 
patients with facial fractures, but an acceptable result is often obtainable. 
However, an eventful course, including extended hospital/intensive care unit 
stays and an increased risk of associated injuries and complications, may be 
expected.
