50 years through a total of 30 1-year Markov cycles. Analyses were done 
separately for rural and urban settings. We did a meta-analysis of glaucoma 
prevalence studies in China to obtain prevalence estimates for PACG and POAG. 
Screening costs were taken from a Chinese screening programme and treatment 
costs from a tertiary Chinese eye hospital. Main outcomes were incremental 
cost-utility ratios (ICURs) using quality-adjusted life-years and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using years of blindness avoided. We did 
one-way deterministic and simulated probabilistic sensitivity analyses to 
reflect uncertainty around ICURs and ICERs.
FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, combined screening of POAG and PACG in 
rural China is predicted to result in an ICUR of US$569 (95% CI 17 to 4180) and 
an ICER of $1280 (-58 to 7940), both of which are below the WHO 
cost-effectiveness threshold of one to three times rural gross domestic product. 
For the urban China setting, combined screening is predicted to result in fewer 
net costs and greater gain in health benefits than no screening. Findings were 
robust in all sensitivity analyses. Over 30 years, a total of 246 (95% CI 63 to 
628) and 1325 (510 to 2828) years of blindness are predicted to be avoided for 
every 100 000 rural and urban residents screened, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Population screening for glaucoma (POAG and PACG combined) is 
likely to be cost-effective in both urban and rural China. Future studies should 
investigate the effectiveness of interventions to improve acceptance of 
definitive care among people screened.

In the Drosophila brain, neurons form genetically specified synaptic connections 
with defined neuronal targets. It is proposed that each central nervous system 
neuron expresses specific cell surface proteins, which act as identification 
tags. Through an RNAi screen of cell surface molecules in the Drosophila visual 
system, we found that the cell adhesion molecule Klingon (Klg) plays an 
important role in repressing the ectopic formation of extended axons, preventing 
the formation of excessive synapses. Cell-specific manipulation of klg showed 
that Klg is required in both photoreceptors and the glia, suggesting that the 
balanced homophilic interaction between photoreceptor axons and the glia is 
required for normal synapse formation. Previous studies suggested that Klg binds 
to cDIP and our genetic analyses indicate that cDIP is required in glia for 
ectopic synaptic repression. These data suggest that Klg play a critical role 
together with cDIP in refining synaptic specificity and preventing unnecessary 
connections in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Although the choice between stereotactic ablative radiotherapy 
(SABR) and lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been 
debated for years, the two procedures have not yet been directly compared in a 
randomized trial. We conducted a virtual randomized phase III trial stratified 
by age to compare the effectiveness of lobectomy and SABR for medically operable 
patients with stage IA (AJCC eighth) NSCLC using the Markov model analysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients aged 
45-85 years with stage IA NSCLC who had undergone either lobectomy or SABR and 
were followed up for their remaining lifetime. Each virtual patient was randomly 
assigned to undergo lobectomy or SABR, and 10 000 patients were allocated to 
each group. All estimates of the variables were obtained by a systematic review 
of published articles.
RESULTS: The lobectomy group showed a better life expectancy than the SABR 
group, in patients under 75 years of age. However, no statistically significant 
difference was seen in patients 75 years or older. The predicted life expectancy 
was 9.43 and 8.70 years in 75-year-old patients in the lobectomy and SABR 
groups, respectively. However, the 95%CI for the difference in life expectancy 
between the two groups was - 0.06-1.50 years (P = 0.0689).
CONCLUSIONS: The Markov model showed no statistically significant difference in 
the expected overall survival in stage IA NSCLC patients who were older than 
75 years and had undergone SABR or lobectomy.

AIMS: The coronary sinus Reducer is a percutaneous device proven to improve 
angina symptoms in refractory angina (RA). We evaluated its potential 
cost-effectiveness and impact on the healthcare resource use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Angina-related healthcare resource usage and 
quality-of-life data were collected for 215 consecutive RA patients undergoing 
Reducer implantation in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy. Costs were assessed 
from each country's healthcare system perspective. Data from the date of RA 
diagnosis to Reducer implantation [Standard-of-Care (SoC)-period] and from 
Reducer implantation to follow-up (Reducer-period) were compared: during 
Reducer-period, a significant reduction in angina-driven hospitalizations, 
outpatient visits, coronary angiograms, and percutaneous coronary interventions 
per patient-year was observed, translating into significantly reduced costs per 
patient-year. To assess cost-effectiveness, costs and utilities of 1-year SoC 
were compared with those of 1-year Reducer-period. Assumptions on Reducer 
efficacy duration were further explored with modelled projections. Reducer was 
associated with higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs: 0.665 vs. 0.580, 
P < 0.001) and incremental costs, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of 53 197, 34 948, 63 146 €/QALY gained in Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
Italy, respectively. Under both the assumptions of 2 and 3 years Reducer effect 
duration with a 30%-year efficacy decrease, the device yielded ICERs in the 
range of 1977-20 796 €/QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: In patients with RA, Reducer device decreases healthcare resource 
use and related costs. In a limited 1-year timeframe, Reducer is consistently 
cost-effective according to a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Under the 
explored assumptions, the device yields cost-effectiveness ratios suggesting 
high value from all the considered perspectives.

Successful ageing has become an important concept to describe the quality of 
ageing. It is a multidimensional concept, and the main focus is how to expand 
functional years in a later life span. The concept has developed from a 
biomedical approach to a wider understanding of social and psychological 
adaptation processes in later life. However, a standard definition of successful 
ageing remains unclear and various operational definitions of concept have been 
used in various studies. In this review we will describe some definitions and 
operational indicators of successful ageing with a multidimensional approach.

Aging is a powerful risk factor for the development of many chronic diseases 
including dementia. Research based on disease models of dementia have yet to 
yield effective treatments, therefore it is opportune to consider whether the 
aging process itself might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment 
and prevention of dementia. Numerous cellular and molecular pathways have been 
implicated in the aging process and compounds that target these processes are 
being developed to slow aging and delay the onset of age-associated conditions. 
A few particularly promising therapeutic agents have been shown to influence 
many of the main hallmarks of aging and increase life span in rodents. Here we 
discuss the evidence that some of these antiaging compounds may beneficially 
affect brain aging and thereby lower the risk for dementia.

Four decades ago, Iran encountered rapid sociodemographic and economic 
transitions. This review was carried out to investigate the trend of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence, mortality and morbidity, relevant 
challenges and suggestions for prevention of CVD. In Iran, the most prevalent 
causes of death have transited from infectious and diarrheal diseases in 1960 to 
CVD few decades ago. CVD was the first leading cause of mortality and a million 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) led to 46% of all deaths and 20%-23% of 
the burden of disease in Iran. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are considered 
the first and second cause of death and DALYs in Iran, respectively. CVD rising 
epidemic might be related to socioeconomic and cultural changes, nutrition 
transition, inadequate physical activity, industrialization and urbanization and 
increasing life expectancy, increasing metabolic and physical risk factors, low 
accessibility and affordability to primary care and treatment, and low 
compliance because of economic and psychological problems. Thus, planning and 
implementing strategies for prevention and control of the disease and its risk 
factors are on top of the ministry of health agenda in the recent years. Health 
promotion strategies to prevent and control CVD risk factors, early detection of 
the disease and treatment of acute and chronic CVD events are essential elements 
for reducing the burden of CVD in Iran.

BACKGROUND: Firearm mortality is a leading, and largely avoidable, cause of 
death in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We aimed to assess the changes 
over time and demographic determinants of firearm deaths in these four countries 
between 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: In this comparative analysis of firearm mortality, we examined national 
vital statistics data from 1990-2015 from four publicly available data 
repositories in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We extracted 
medically-certified deaths and underlying population denominators to calculate 
the age-specific and sex-specific firearm deaths and the risk of firearm 
mortality at the national and subnational level, by education for all four 
countries, and by race or ethnicity for the USA and Brazil. Analyses were 
stratified by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, or undetermined). We 
quantified avoidable mortality for each country using the lowest number of 
subnational age-specific and period-specific death rates.
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2015, 106·3 million medically-certified deaths were 
recorded, including 2 472 000 firearm deaths, of which 851 000 occurred in the 
USA, 272 000 in Mexico, 855 000 in Brazil, and 494 000 in Colombia. Homicides 
accounted for most of the firearm deaths in Mexico (225 000 [82·7%]), Colombia 
(463 000 [93·8%]), and Brazil (766 000 [89·5%]). Suicide accounted for more than 
half of all firearm deaths in the USA (479 000 [56·3%]). In each country, 
firearm mortality was highest among men aged 15-34 years, accounting for up to 
half of the total risk of death in that age group. During the study period, 
firearm mortality risks increased in Mexico and Brazil but decreased in the USA 
and Colombia, with marked national and subnational geographical variation. Young 
men with low educational attainment were at increased risk of firearm homicide 
in all four countries, and in the USA and Brazil, black and brown men, 
respectively, were at the highest risk. The risk of firearm homicide was 14 
times higher in black men in the USA aged 25-34 years with low educational 
attainment than comparably-educated white men (1·52% [99% CI 1·50-1·54] vs 0·11% 
[0·10-0·12]), and up to four times higher than in comparably-educated men in 
Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. In the USA, the risk of firearm homicide was more 
than 30 times higher in black men with post-secondary education than comparably 
educated white men. If countries could achieve the same firearm mortality rates 
nationally as in their lowest-burden states, 1 777 800 firearm deaths at all 
ages and in both sexes could be avoided, including 1 028 000 deaths in men aged 
15-34 years.
INTERPRETATION: Firearm mortality in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia is 
highest among young adult men, and is strongly associated with race and 
ethnicity, and low education levels. Reductions in firearm deaths would improve 
life expectancy, particularly for black men in the USA, and would reduce racial 
and educational disparities in mortality.

OBJECTIVE: "Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history of negative 
health events" (SMART) is a novel group-format epilepsy self-management 
intervention demonstrated to reduce negative health events (NHEs) such as 
accidents, emergency department visits, and seizures in adults with epilepsy in 
a 6-month prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT); SMART also reduced 
depressive symptoms and improved health functioning and quality of life. This 
report describes the longer-term (12-month) post-efficacy RCT outcomes in adults 
with epilepsy who received SMART.
METHODS: After completing a 6-month, prospective RCT that demonstrated efficacy 
of SMART vs 6-month waitlist control (WL), adults ≥18 years of age with epilepsy 
were followed for an additional 12 months. Individuals originally randomized to 
WL received the 8-week SMART intervention immediately following the conclusion 
of the RCT. For this long-term extension analysis, assessments were conducted at 
24 weeks (the 6-month primary outcome time-point of the efficacy RCT), at 
32 weeks for individuals originally randomized to WL, and at 48 weeks and 
72 weeks for all individuals. Outcomes assessed included past 6-month NHE 
counts, depressive symptoms assessed with the 9-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and 
quality of life assessed with the 10-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy 
(QOLIE-10).
RESULTS: At the beginning of this long-term observational period (24-week 
follow-up time point for the original RCT), there were 50 individuals in the 
group originally randomized to SMART and 52 originally randomized to WL. Mean 
age was 41.4 years, 70% women (N = 71), 64% (N = 65) African-American, and 8% 
Hispanic (N = 8). Study attrition from week 24 to week 72 was 8% in the arm 
originally randomized to SMART and 17% in the arm originally randomized to WL. 
During the 12-month observation period (24 weeks to 72 weeks), there were a 
total of 44 serious adverse events and 4 deaths, none related to study 
participation. There was no significant change in total past 6-month NHE counts 
in the group originally randomized to SMART, although the group had 
significantly reduced 6-month seizure counts. The group originally randomized to 
WL, who received SMART during this observational period, had a reduction in 
total NHE counts. The group originally randomized to SMART had relatively stable 
levels on other outcome variables except for a trend for improved MADRS 
(p = 0.08). In the group originally randomized to WL, there were significant 
improvements in PHQ-9 (p = 0.01), MADRS (p ≤ 0.01), and QOLIE-10 (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: This post-RCT extension study suggests that adults with epilepsy 
who participate in the SMART intervention sustain clinical effects at 1-year 
follow-up and may have incremental improvements in seizure frequency and mood. 
Future research needs to identify opportunities for scale-up and outreach to 
other high-risk groups with epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Cost-effectiveness analyses that use quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) allow comparing the value for money of interventions across different 
health problems. Health state utility values (HSUVs) are crucial to calculate 
QALYs. These are weights attached to a given health state reflecting preferences 
in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In schizophrenia, there is extensive 
evidence about the consequences of this condition on HRQoL. Besides, several 
interventions have claimed to be cost-effective in terms of QALYs gained. 
Despite this evidence, a systematic review of HSUVs has not been conducted. 
Therefore, we aim to synthesise the evidence about HSUVs in schizophrenia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of the literature 
about HSUVs in people with schizophrenia following the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis and the International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research task force recommendations. The 
submissions records of eight electronic peer-reviewed databases and three health 
technology assessment (HTA) agencies will be searched. Quantitative synthesis 
will be carried out in comparable studies, using random-effects meta-analysis. 
Heterogeneity will be explored using meta-regression if more than 10 studies per 
covariate are found. A narrative synthesis and methodological quality of 
included studies will be also reported.
DISCUSSION: This review will provide a synthesis of the HSUVs estimated for 
different states experienced by people with schizophrenia. This will inform 
analysts when calculating QALYs, using values in a more transparent and 
accountable manner. Finally, it will shed light on evidence gaps and limitations 
about this measure in mental health.

The elongation growth of the mushroom stipe is a characteristic but not 
well-understood morphogenetic event of basidiomycetes. We found that extending 
native stipe cell walls of Coprinopsis cinerea were associated with the release 
of N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose and with chitinase activity. Two 
chitinases among all detected chitinases from C. cinerea, ChiE1 and ChiIII, 
reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension and released 
N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose. Interestingly, both ChiE1 and ChiIII 
hydrolyze insoluble crystalline chitin powder, while other C. cinerea chitinases 
do not, suggesting that crystalline chitin components of the stipe cell wall are 
the target of action for ChiE1 and ChiIII. ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted 
heat-inactivated stipe walls showed maximal extension activity at pH 4.5, 
consistent with the optimal pH for native stipe wall extension in vitro; ChiE1- 
or ChiIII-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension activities were 
associated with stipe elongation growth regions; and the combination of ChiE1 
and ChiIII showed a synergism to reconstitute heat-inactivated stipe wall 
extension at a low action concentration. Field emission scanning electron 
microscopy (FESEM) images showed that the inner surface of acid-induced extended 
native stipe cell walls and ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted extended 
heat-inactivated stipe cell walls exhibited a partially broken parallel 
microfibril architecture; however, these broken transversely arranged 
microfibrils were not observed in the unextended stipe cell walls that were 
induced by neutral pH buffer or heat inactivation. Double knockdown of ChiE1 and 
ChiIII resulted in the reduction of stipe elongation, mycelium growth, and 
heat-sensitive cell wall extension of native stipes. These results indicate a 
chitinase-hydrolyzing mechanism for stipe cell wall extension.IMPORTANCE A 
remarkable feature in the development of basidiomycete fruiting bodies is stipe 
elongation growth that results primarily from manifold cell elongation. Some 
scientists have suggested that stipe elongation is the result of enzymatic 
hydrolysis of cell wall polysaccharides, while other scientists have proposed 
the possibility that stipe elongation results from nonhydrolytic disruption of 
the hydrogen bonds between cell wall polysaccharides. Here, we show direct 
evidence for a chitinase-hydrolyzing mechanism of stipe cell wall elongation in 
the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea that is different from the expansin 
nonhydrolysis mechanism of plant cell wall extension. We presumed that in the 
growing stipe cell walls, parallel chitin microfibrils are tethered by 
β-1,6-branched β-1,3-glucans, and that the breaking of the tether by chitinases 
leads to separation of these microfibrils to increase their spacing for 
insertion of new synthesized chitin and β-1,3-glucans under turgor pressure in 
vivo.

Metagenomics of marine sediments has uncovered a broad diversity of new 
uncultured taxa and provided insights into their metabolic capabilities. Here, 
we detected microbial lineages from a sediment core near the Jiulong methane 
reef of the northern South China Sea (at 1,100-m depth). Assembly and binning of 
the metagenomes resulted in 11 genomes (>85% complete) that represented nine 
distinct phyla, including candidate phyla TA06 and LCP-89, Lokiarchaeota, 
Heimdallarchaeota, and a newly described globally distributed phylum (B38). The 
genome of LCP-89 has pathways for nitrate, selenate, and sulfate reduction, 
suggesting that they may be involved in mediating these important processes. B38 
are able to participate in the cycling of hydrogen and selenocompounds. Many of 
these uncultured microbes may also be capable of autotrophic CO2 fixation, as 
exemplified by identification of the Wood-Ljungdahl (W-L) pathway. Genes 
encoding carbohydrate degradation, W-L pathway, Rnf-dependent energy 
conservation, and Ni/Fe hydrogenases were detected in the transcriptomes of 
these novel members. Characterization of these new lineages provides insight to 
the undescribed branches in the tree of life.IMPORTANCE Sedimentary 
microorganisms in the South China Sea (SCS) remain largely unknown due to the 
complexity of sediment communities impacted by continent rifting and extension. 
Distinct geochemical environments may breed special microbial communities 
including microbes that are still enigmatic. Functional inference of their 
metabolisms and transcriptional activity provides insight in the ecological 
roles and substrate-based interactivity of these uncultured Archaea and Bacteria 
These microorganisms play different roles in utilizing inorganic carbon and 
scavenging diverse organic compounds involved in the deep-sea carbon cycle. The 
genomes recovered here contributed undescribed species to the tree of life and 
laid the foundation for future study on these novel phyla persisting in marginal 
sediments of the SCS.

The FDA approved drug rapamycin can prolong lifespan in diverse species and 
delay the onset of age-related disease in mammals. However, a number of 
fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the mechanisms by which 
rapamycin modulates age-related pathophysiology and lifespan. Alterations in the 
gut microbiota can impact host physiology, metabolism and lifespan. While recent 
studies have shown that rapamycin treatment alters the gut microbiota in aged 
animals, the causal relationships between rapamycin treatment, microbiota 
dynamics and aging are not known. Here, using Drosophila as a model organism, we 
show that rapamycin-mediated alterations in microbiota dynamics in aged flies 
are associated with improved markers of intestinal and muscle aging. Critically, 
however, we show that the beneficial effects of rapamycin treatment on tissue 
aging and lifespan are not dependent upon the microbiota. Indeed, germ-free 
flies show delayed onset of intestinal barrier dysfunction, improved 
proteostasis in aged muscles and a significant lifespan extension upon rapamycin 
treatment. In contrast, genetic inhibition of autophagy impairs the ability of 
rapamycin to mediate improved gut health and proteostasis during aging. Our 
results indicate that rapamycin-mediated modulation of the microbiota in aged 
animals is not causally required to slow tissue and organismal aging.

PURPOSE: A first cost-effectiveness analysis has raised a strong concern 
regarding the cost of tumor treatment fields (TTF) added to maintenance 
temozolomide for patients with glioblastoma. This evaluation was based on 
effectiveness outcomes from an interim analysis of the pivotal trial, moreover 
it used a "standard" Markov model. Our objective was to update the 
cost-effectiveness evaluation using the more flexible potential of the 
"partitioned survival" model design and using the latest effectiveness data.
METHODS: We developed the model with three mutually exclusive health states: 
stable disease, progressive disease, and dead. Good fit parametric models were 
developed for overall survival and progression free survival and these generated 
clinically plausible extrapolations beyond the observed data. We adopted the 
perspective of the French national health insurance and used a 20-year time 
horizon. Results were expressed as cost/life-years (LY) gained (LYG).
RESULTS: The base case model generated incremental benefit of 0.604 LY at a cost 
of €453,848 which, after 4% annual discounting of benefits and costs, yielded an 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €510,273/LYG. Using sensitivity 
analyses and bootstrapping methods results were found to be relatively robust 
and were only sensitive to TTF device costs and the modelling of overall 
survival. To achieve an ICER below €100,000/LYG would require a reduction in TTF 
device cost of approximately 85%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a different type of model and updated survival outcomes, our 
results show TTF remains an intervention that is not cost-effective, which 
greatly restrains its diffusion to potentially eligible patients.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care and Advance Care Planning (ACP) are increasingly 
recommended for an optimal management of late-stage dementia. In Belgium, 
euthanasia has been decriminalized in 2002 for patients who are "mentally 
competent" (interpreted as non-demented). It has been suggested that advance 
directives for euthanasia (ADE) should be made possible for dementia patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study presents the results of an internet survey among Belgian 
dementia specialists.
METHODS: In 2013, the Belgian Dementia Council (BeDeCo) organized a debate on 
end of life decisions in dementia. Participants were medical doctors who are 
specialists in the dementia field. After the debate, an anonymous internet 
survey was organized. The participation rate was 55%. The sample was 
representative of the BeDeCo members.
RESULTS: The results showed consensus in favor of palliative care and ACP, 
although ACP is not systematically addressed in practice. Few patients with 
dementia have requested euthanasia, but for those who did the participants had 
agreed to implement it for some patients. A majority of participants (94%) 
believe that most patients and their families are poorly informed about 
euthanasia. Although most participants (77%) said they approved the Law on 
euthanasia, 65% said they were against an extension of the Law to allow ADE for 
dementia.
CONCLUSION: Palliative care and ACP are clearly accepted by professionals, 
although a gap between recommendation and practice remain. Euthanasia is a much 
more debated issue, even if a majority of professionals are, in principle, in 
favor of the current Law and seem to disapprove with a Law change allowing ADE 
for dementia. A better education for both health professionals and the lay 
public will be a key element in the future.

Objective: Three vaccines are available to Taiwanese young girls for cervical 
cancer (CC) prevention. Here we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two-dose 
(2D) AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine (2D-AS04-HPV- 16/18v)+screening compared 
with a screening programme alone, with 2D human papillomavirus 6/11/16/18 
vaccine (2D-4vHPVv)+screening, and with 2D/three-dose (3D) human papillomavirus 
6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine (9vHPVv)+screening, for Taiwan universal mass 
vaccination. Methods: A static Markov cohort model simulated the natural history 
of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and CC screening for a 12-year-old 
cohort of Taiwanese girls (N=120,000). The model ran in 1-year cycles over the 
cohort’s lifetime. Vaccine efficacy irrespective of HPV type was considered in 
the analysis for each vaccine. Input data were obtained from published 
literature, local databases, government reports and websites, and expert 
opinion. The analysis incorporated direct medical costs only, with an annual 
discount rate of 3.0%. The threshold was determined as 1 Gross Domestic Product 
per capita (New Taiwan dollar [NT$] 727,818; year 2016). Results: The 
2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v+screening yielded 0.0365 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained at an additional cost of NT$ 5,770 per person compared with the screening 
programme alone. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well 
below the threshold. Compared with 2D-4vHPVv+screening and 
2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening, discounted results demonstrated additional QALYs gained 
at lower cost for 2D-AS04-HPV- 16/18v+screening, making it dominant over both 
2D-4vHPVv+screening and 2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening. Conclusions: Vaccinating 
Taiwanese girls with 2D-AS04-HPV-16/18v in addition to screening to prevent CC 
is cost-effective compared with using a screening programme alone and the 
dominant option compared with 2D-4vHPVv+screening and 2D/3D-9vHPVv+screening.

How Should One Live Everlasting Life?

Harbut RF.

New and emerging life-extension technologies require careful consideration of 
ethical implications related to resource scarcity and justice, prompting an 
analysis of what, if anything, is intrinsic to experiences we define as human. 
Furthermore, extended lifespans suggest the importance of reinterpreting 
traditional roles of health care professionals as the needs of patients, 
communities, and clinicians shift.

OBJECTIVE: To review the cost-effectiveness of food allergy management 
strategies.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTIONS: A narrative review and synthesis of 
literature identified using a PubMed search of relevant articles describing 
cost-effectiveness evaluations of food allergy management.
RESULTS: Screening at-risk infants for peanut allergy carries risk of 
overdiagnosis and is not cost-effective. Evidence suggests that cost-effective 
care could be better optimized by minimizing delay in oral food challenges for 
eligible patients, clarifying the role of precautionary allergen labeling, 
incorporating patient-preference sensitive care in activation of emergency 
medical services for resolved allergic reactions, and considering value-based 
pricing and school-supply models for epinephrine. Finally, the annual 
value-based cost (willingness to pay [WTP] $100,000/quality-adjusted life years 
[QALY]) of peanut immunotherapy has been estimated to be between $1568 and $6568 
for epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) and between $1235 and $5235 for probiotic 
with peanut oil immunotherapy (POIT), with each therapy showing more favorable 
cost-effectiveness with greater improvements in health utility, particularly if 
sustained unresponsiveness can be achieved.
CONCLUSION: Many aspects of food allergy management are not cost-effective, and 
recent evaluations suggest a greater role for incorporating patient and family 
preferences into guideline-based and traditionally reflexive management 
decisions. Caregiver understanding of food allergy screening tradeoffs is 
critical, given that screening children before allergen exposure has significant 
costs and results in overdiagnosis, especially when oral food challenges are 
omitted from diagnostic algorithms. Cost-effectiveness analysis can help to 
identify important decision levers in patient management across a wide range of 
topics. Further research is needed to better understand health state utilities 
of specific patient populations.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a cost-effectiveness primer for the practicing allergist.
DATA SOURCES: Articles assessing use of decision analysis and cost-effective 
healthcare delivery.
STUDY SELECTIONS: A narrative review detailing approaches to incorporate 
evidence based medicine into individualized patient-centered cost-effective 
practice.
RESULTS: Resources in medicine are finite and it has been estimated that more 
than 30% of healthcare spending is directed toward low-value care. Insurers and 
government agencies are increasingly looking to maximize health value. 
Cost-effective analyses (CEA) is a complex valuation that grades health outcomes 
and economic benefits of a specific aspect of clinical care over a particular 
time horizon. In the US, therapies are generally considered cost-effective at 
ceilings between $50,000 - $150,000 per QALY. Critical components of CEA include 
model development to accurately represent clinical decisions and outcomes, 
evidence-based inputs, appropriate sensitivity analyses, and clarity in 
selecting the target population, perspective, comparators, time horizon, 
discount rate, and health outcomes. CEA can better inform trade-offs in patient 
care and add clarity in the translation of evidence to medical recommendations. 
Future research is likely to provide a more complete understanding of variation 
across population health state utilities for allergic conditions to more 
accurately reflect quality adjusted life years for patients with allergies.
CONCLUSION: Viewing healthcare options through an economic lens has become the 
standard of care across the United States and internationally, whether mandated 
through government agencies or third party payers. Decision analysis with
