Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer and second leading 
cause of mortality from cancer in the United States. As the population ages, 
decisions regarding the initiation and cessation of screening and surveillance 
for CRC are of increasing importance. In elderly patients, the risks of CRC and 
the presenting signs and symptoms are similar to those in younger patients. 
Screening and ongoing surveillance should be considered in patients who have a 
life expectancy of 10 years or more. Life expectancy estimates can be calculated 
using online calculators. If screening is deemed appropriate, the choice of 
which test to use first is unclear. Currently, there are a number of modalities 
available to screen for CRC, including both invasive modalities (eg, 
colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, capsule colonoscopy, and computed tomographic 
colonography) and noninvasive modalities (fecal immunochemical test, stool DNA 
testing, and blood testing). Colonoscopy and other invasive testing options are 
considered safe, but the risks of complications of the bowel preparation, the 
procedure, and sedation medications are all increased in older patients. In 
contrast, noninvasive testing provides a safe initial test; however, it is 
important to consider the increased false-positive rates in the elderly, and a 
positive test result will usually necessitate colonoscopy to establish the 
diagnosis. Ongoing screening and surveillance should be a shared decision-making 
process with the patient based on multiple factors including the patient's 
morbidity and mortality risk from CRC and his or her underlying comorbidities, 
the patient's functional status, and the patient's preferences for screening. 
Ultimately, the decision to initiate or discontinue screening for CRC in older 
patients should be done based on a case-by-case individualized discussion.

A trend towards charging for access to research findings, tools and databases is 
becoming more prominent globally. But charging for the use of research tools and 
databases that are vital to research supporting national and international 
policy development might be unjustified. Financial barriers to accessing these 
tools and databases disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, 
who may have greater need for information that fuels research in their areas of 
concern. However, changing this trend is potentially possible. One example is 
the experience with the EuroQol-five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D), a 
generic measure of health status used in economic evaluations for resource 
allocation decisions. Increasingly, governments and health-care providers are 
using the EQ-5D tool in patient-reported outcome measures to monitor quality of 
health-care provision, diagnose and track disease progression, and involve 
patients in their health care. The EuroQol Group, which owns the intellectual 
property rights to the EQ-5D, recently terminated their policy of charging for 
noncommercial, nonresearch uses of the tool. We share a brief history of this 
development and examine these charging policies in the context of the EQ-5D's 
use in national health-care research and policies, reflecting the trends and 
developments in the use of survey instruments on population health.

Publisher: On observe à l'échelle mondiale une tendance de plus en plus marquée 
à la tarification de l'accès aux résultats, aux outils et aux bases de données 
de recherche. Cependant, la tarification de l'utilisation d'outils et de bases 
de données essentiels aux recherches appuyant l'élaboration de politiques 
nationales et internationales n'est pas toujours justifiée. Les obstacles 
financiers qui entravent l'accès à ces outils et bases de données affectent de 
manière disproportionnée les pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire, qui peuvent 
avoir davantage besoin d'informations pour alimenter des recherches sur leurs 
sujets de préoccupation. Il est toutefois possible d'infléchir cette tendance. 
Le questionnaire EuroQol-five-dimensions (EQ-5D), une mesure générale de l'état 
de santé utilisée dans les évaluations économiques pour les décisions relatives 
à l'affectation des ressources, constitue un exemple. Les gouvernements et les 
prestataires de soins de santé utilisent de plus en plus l'outil EQ-5D dans les 
mesures des résultats notifiés par les patients pour surveiller la qualité de la 
prestation des soins de santé, diagnostiquer et suivre l'évolution d'une 
maladie, et associer les patients à leurs soins de santé. Le groupe EuroQol, qui 
détient les droits de propriété intellectuelle relatifs à l'EQ-5D, a récemment 
mis fin à sa politique de tarification pour l'utilisation de l'outil à des fins 
non commerciales et dans un contexte autre que celui de la recherche. Nous 
retraçons brièvement ce cheminement et examinons ces politiques de tarification 
dans le contexte de l'utilisation de l'EQ-5D dans les recherches et politiques 
nationales sur les soins de santé, en rendant compte de l'évolution de 
l'utilisation du matériel d'enquête sur la santé de la population.

Publisher: La tendencia a cobrar por el acceso a los resultados de las 
investigaciones, las herramientas y las bases de datos está cobrando cada vez 
más importancia en todo el mundo. Sin embargo, puede que no esté justificado 
cobrar por el uso de herramientas de investigación y bases de datos que son 
vitales para la investigación en apoyo del desarrollo de políticas nacionales e 
internacionales. Las barreras financieras para acceder a estas herramientas y 
bases de datos afectan desproporcionadamente a los países de ingresos bajos y 
medios, que pueden tener una mayor necesidad de información que impulse la 
investigación en sus áreas de interés. Sin embargo, es posible cambiar esta 
tendencia. Un ejemplo es la experiencia con el cuestionario de cinco dimensiones 
EuroQol (EQ-5D), una medida genérica del estado de salud utilizada en las 
evaluaciones económicas para las decisiones de asignación de recursos. Cada vez 
más, los gobiernos y los proveedores de la atención de la salud están utilizando 
la herramienta EQ-5D en las medidas de resultado informadas por el paciente para 
supervisar la calidad de la prestación de la atención de la salud, diagnosticar 
y hacer un seguimiento de la progresión de la enfermedad e involucrar a los 
pacientes en su cuidado de la salud. El Grupo EuroQol, propietario de los 
derechos de propiedad intelectual de EQ-5D, puso fin recientemente a su política 
de cobrar por los usos no comerciales y no relacionados con la investigación de 
la herramienta. En este artículo se presenta una breve historia de este 
desarrollo y se examinan estas políticas de cobro en el contexto del uso de 
EQ-5D en la investigación y las políticas nacionales de atención de la salud, 
reflejando las tendencias y los avances en el uso de los instrumentos de las 
encuestas sobre la salud de la población.

在全球范围内，要求付费以获取研究成果、工具和数据库的现象逐渐成为一种重要趋势。但是，使用对支持国家和国际政策发展的研究至关重要的研究工具和数据库时，相关收费并不合理。为访问这些工具和数据库设置的资金障碍对中低收入国家的影响尤为严重，这是因为中低收入国家可能需要更多信息以推动其相关领域的研究发展。但是，或许可以改变这种趋势。以使用 EuroQol 五维问卷（EQ-5D，在资源分配决策相关经济评估方面使用的通用健康状态测量量表）的经验为例。越来越多的政府部门和医疗保健提供者在患者报告结局测量方面使用 EQ-5D 工具，以监控医疗保健质量、诊断和跟踪疾病进展并吸引患者参与其医疗保健项目。拥有 EQ-5D 的知识产权的欧洲生存质量学会最近终止了一项政策，即其针对出于非商业和非研究目的使用该工具的情况实施的收费政策。我们简单分享了其发展史，并基于 EQ-5D 在国家医疗保健研究和政策领域的使用情况，研究了这些收费政策，以反映使用人口健康调查工具的趋势和发展。.

Publisher: Тенденция к начислению платы за доступ к результатам, инструментам и 
базам данных исследований приобретает ярко выраженный характер по всему миру. Но 
взимание платы за использование инструментов и баз данных исследований, 
совершенно необходимых для поддержки развития национальных и международных 
политик, может быть необоснованным. Финансовые барьеры к использованию этих 
инструментов и баз данных могут непропорционально сильно сказаться на странах со 
средним и низким уровнем дохода, которые могут испытывать большую потребность в 
информации, поддерживающей проведение исследований в проблемных для данных стран 
областях. Однако существует потенциальная возможность изменить такую тенденцию. 
В качестве одного из примеров можно привести опросник из пяти вопросов 
EuroQol (EQ-5D) — общий показатель состояния здоровья, используемый при 
экономической оценке для принятия решений о распределении ресурсов. 
Правительства стран и медицинские учреждения все чаще используют инструмент 
EQ-5D для измерения результатов, сообщаемых пациентами, с целью контроля 
качества оказания медицинской помощи, диагностики и отслеживания течения 
заболевания, а также вовлечения пациентов в процесс медицинского обслуживания. 
Компания EuroQol Group, которая владеет правами интеллектуальной собственности 
на EQ-5D, недавно отказалась от политики начисления платы за некоммерческое 
использование инструмента, не связанное с проведением исследований. Авторы 
вкратце рассказывают о развитии данной ситуации и рассматривают политики 
относительно начисления платы в контексте использования EQ-5D в национальных 
исследованиях и разработке политик в области здравоохранения, отражающих 
тенденции и изменения в использовании средств исследования здоровья населения.

Rabbit welfare: determining priority welfare issues for pet rabbits using a 
modified Delphi method.

BACKGROUND: Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, but little 
research into their welfare needs has been conducted.
METHODS: A modified Delphi method was used to generate expert consensus on the 
most important welfare issues for rabbits in the UK. The study involved 11 
experts, recruited from a range of disciplines. The experts generated an initial 
broad list of welfare issues via an online discussion board. Two rounds of 
online surveys were conducted to prioritise these issues. The final round was a 
workshop with a subsection of experts. The experts decided that welfare issues 
should be ranked considering: (1) severity, (2) duration, and (3) prevalence.
RESULTS: Experts considered that rabbits were often kept in inadequate housing, 
were not handled or socialised properly, were fed inappropriate diets and owners 
failed to vaccinate their rabbits against preventable diseases. Rabbits were 
thought to experience a reduced life expectancy. Lack of owner knowledge of 
rabbit husbandry and behaviour and, in some cases, also lack of veterinary 
knowledge, contributed to poor rabbit welfare.
CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process resulted in consensus on the most significant 
welfare challenges faced by rabbits and can help guide future research and 
education priority decisions.

Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for persons with kidney failure. 
However, those on hemodialysis still face a poor quality of life and a short 
life expectancy. High-quality research evidence from large randomized controlled 
trials is needed to identify interventions that improve the experiences, 
outcomes, and health care of persons receiving hemodialysis. With the support of 
the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and its Strategy for Patient-Oriented 
Research, the Innovative Clinical Trials in Hemodialysis Centers initiative 
brought together Canadian and international kidney researchers, patients, health 
care providers, and health administrators to participate in a workshop held in 
Toronto, Canada, on June 2 and 3, 2018. The workshop served to increase 
knowledge and awareness about the conduct of innovative, pragmatic, 
cluster-randomized registry trials embedded into routine hemodialysis care and 
provided an opportunity to discuss and build support for new trial ideas. The 
workshop content included structured presentations, facilitated group 
discussions, and expert panel feedback. Partnerships and promising trial ideas 
borne out of the workshop will continue to be developed to support the 
implementation of future large-scale trials.

Publisher: L’hémodialyse constitue un traitement essentiel au maintien de la vie 
pour les personnes atteintes d’insuffisance rénale. Les patients hémodialysés 
voient cependant leur qualité et leur espérance de vie réduites. Des données de 
recherches probantes, provenant de vastes essais cliniques contrôlés à 
répartition aléatoire, sont nécessaires pour améliorer l’expérience, les 
résultats et les soins des patients hémodialysés. Grâce au soutien des Instituts 
de recherche en santé du Canada (IRSC) et de leur Stratégie de recherche axée 
sur le patient (SRAP), l’initiative sur les essais cliniques novateurs (ECN) en 
centres d’hémodialyse a réuni divers intervenants en santé rénale (chercheurs, 
patients, fournisseurs de soins et administrateurs), du Canada et de partout 
dans le monde, lors d’un colloque qui s’est tenu à Toronto les 2 et 3 juin 2018. 
Ce colloque a permis d’accroître la sensibilisation et les connaissances sur la 
conduite d’essais cliniques novateurs, répartis en grappes, pragmatiques et 
intégrés aux soins d’hémodialyse de routine. Cette rencontre a également fourni 
une occasion de discuter de nouvelles idées d’essais cliniques et de susciter 
les appuis nécessaires à leur réalisation. Le colloque s’est déroulé sous forme 
de présentations structurées, de discussions animées en groupe et de rétroaction 
de la part d’un comité d’experts. Les idées de recherche prometteuses et les 
partenariats issus de ce colloque continueront d’être développés pour soutenir 
la réalisation d’essais cliniques futurs de grande envergure.

Methods for measuring and valuing health benefits for economic evaluation and 
health technology assessment in adult populations are well developed. In 
contrast, methods for assessing interventions for child and adolescent 
populations lack detailed guidelines, particularly regarding the valuation of 
health and quality of life in these age groups. This paper critically examines 
the methodological considerations involved in the valuation of child- and 
adolescent-specific health-related quality of life by existing preference-based 
measures. It also describes the methodological choices made in the valuation of 
existing generic preference-based measures developed with and/or applied in 
child and adolescent populations: AHUM, AQoL-6D, CHU9D, EQ-5D-Y, HUI2, HUI3, 
QWB, 16D and 17D. The approaches used to value existing child- and 
adolescent-specific generic preference-based measures vary considerably. While 
the choice of whose preferences and which perspective to use is a matter of 
normative debate and ultimately for decision by reimbursement agencies and 
policy makers, greater research around these issues would be informative and 
would enrich these discussions. Research can also inform the other 
methodological choices required in the valuation of child and adolescent health 
states. Gaps in research evidence are identified around the impact of the child 
described in health state valuation exercises undertaken by adults, including 
the possibility of informed preferences; the appropriateness and acceptability 
of valuation tasks for adolescents, in particular tasks involving the state 
'dead'; anchoring of adolescent preferences; and the generation and use of 
combined adult and adolescent preferences.

Cost-effectiveness of FOLFIRI + cetuximab vs FOLFIRI + bevacizumab in the 
first-line treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in Germany: 
data from the FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306) study.

Aims: This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatment 
with FOLFIRI + cetuximab vs FOLFIRI + bevacizumab for patients with RAS 
wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Germany based on the 
randomized phase 3 FIRE-3 trial. For patients with RAS wt mCRC, 
FOLFIRI + cetuximab yielded statistically significant median overall survival 
gains over FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.Materials and methods: A standard 3-state 
partitioned survival cost-utility model was developed to compare the health 
benefits and costs of treatment from a German social health insurance 
perspective using individual patient-level trial data. Health outcomes were 
reported in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. 
Survival was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves supplemented with 
best-fitting parametric survival model extrapolations. Subgroup analyses of 
patients with a left-sided primary tumor location or patients with metastases 
confined to the liver were performed.Results: In the modified intention-to-treat 
analysis, FOLFIRI + cetuximab, providing 0.68 additional LYs (0.53 QALYs), 
yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of €36,360/LY and 
€47,250/QALY. In subgroup analyses, patients experienced improved survival gains 
without a corresponding increase in costs, resulting in lower ICERs. Our model 
was most sensitive to changes in treatment duration across all lines of therapy, 
utility of progressive disease, as well as patients' weight and body surface 
area.Limitations: This cost-effectiveness analysis was based on patient-level 
data from the FIRE-3 trial. Trial outcomes may not adequately reflect those in 
the real-world setting. Additionally, resource use and costs were obtained from 
tariff lists, which do not account for differences in treatment practice. These 
considerations limit generalizability of outcomes to other countries, or within 
the German healthcare setting.Conclusions: Based on our analyses, 
FOLFIRI + cetuximab is cost-effective compared with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab in 
patients with RAS wt mCRC, with ICERs well below willingness-to-pay thresholds 
for diseases with a high burden.

Aims: Model how moving from current disease-modifying drug (DMD) prescribing 
patterns for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) observed in the 
United Kingdom (UK) to prescribing patterns based on patient preferences would 
impact health outcomes over time.Materials and methods: A cohort-based Markov 
model was used to measure the effect of DMDs on long-term health outcomes for 
individuals with RRMS. Data from a discrete choice experiment were used to 
estimate the market shares of DMDs based on patient preferences (i.e. preference 
shares). These preference shares and real-world UK market shares were used to 
calculate the effect of prescribing behavior on relapses, disability 
progression, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental benefit of 
patient-centered prescribing over current practices for the UK RRMS population 
was then estimated; scenario and sensitivity analyses were also 
conducted.Results: Compared to current prescribing practices, when UK patients 
with RRMS were treated following patient preferences, health outcomes were 
improved. This population was expected to experience 501,690 relapses and gain 
1,003,263 discounted QALYs over 50 years under patient-centered prescribing 
practices compared to 538,417 relapses and 958,792 discounted QALYs under 
current practices (-6.8% and +4.6%, respectively). Additionally, less disability 
progression was observed when prescribed treatment was based on patient 
preferences. In a scenario analysis where only oral treatments were considered, 
the results were similar, although the magnitude of benefit was smaller. Number 
of relapses was most sensitive to how the annualized relapse rate was modeled; 
disability progression was most sensitive to mortality rate 
assumptions.Limitations: Treatment efficacy estimates applied to various models 
in this study were based on data derived from clinical trials, rather than 
real-world data; the impact of patient-centered prescribing on treatment 
adherence and/or switching was not modeled.Conclusions: The population of UK 
RRMS patients may experience overall health gains if patient preferences are 
better incorporated into prescribing practices.

BACKGROUND: The dermis, composed predominantly of dermal fibroblasts and 
extracellular matrix (ECM), consists of fibrous proteins such as collagen and 
elastin and is associated with wrinkle formation and dermal elasticity. As the 
major constituent of the dermal matrix, collagen strengthens the skin, enhances 
its elasticity and protects it from external factors, such as ultraviolet (UV) 
rays, skin inflammation, intracellular metabolites, and aging.
AIMS: Economic growth and long-life expectancy have increased the interest in 
beauty, with extensive studies conducted to evaluate the anti-aging and 
health-promoting benefits of bioactive substances.
METHODS: In this study, we used natural ingredients, Trapa japonica fruit is a 
hard, aquatic plant that grows in ponds or marshes and contains protein and 
starch. To develop the ingredients for comprehensive skin improvement, this 
study investigated the effects of the trapa japonica fruit extract on the 
improvement of skin cells.
CONCLUSION: We investigated the role of the fermented hot-water trapa japonica 
fruit extract to isolate the active ingredients with antiwrinkle effects in 
vitro and ex vivo situation through human dermal fibroblast cell proliferation 
via activating TGF-β1/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway.

Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept compared 
with macular laser photocoagulation and ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema 
(DME) in China. Methods: A Markov model was developed to reflect the vision 
changes in DME patients. Parameters were estimated from VIVID-EAST trial data, 
published literature and physician surveys. Results: In a 20-year horizon, 
intravitreal aflibercept was associated with 7.825 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and 217,841 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY), laser photocoagulation was 
associated with 7.189 QALYs and 135,489 CNY, and ranibizumab was associated with 
7.462 QALYs and 222,477 CNY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
129,397 CNY/QALY and -12,774 CNY/QALY for intravitreal aflibercept versus laser 
photocoagulation and ranibizumab, respectively. Conclusion: Intravitreal 
aflibercept was considered as a cost-effective strategy for DME when compared 
with laser photocoagulation; it was considered as a dominant strategy when 
compared with ranibizumab.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) provides a unique modality for improving 
access to and awareness of palliative care among patients, families, and 
caregivers from diverse backgrounds. Some mHealth palliative care apps exist, 
both commercially available and established by academic researchers. However, 
the elements of family support and family caregiving tools offered by these 
early apps is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to use social convoy theory 
to describe the inclusion and functionality of family, social relationships, and 
caregivers in palliative care mobile apps.
METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review guidelines, a systematic search of 
palliative care mHealth included (1) research-based mobile apps identified from 
academic searches published between January 1, 2010, and March 31, 2019 and (2) 
commercially available apps for app stores in April 2019. Two reviewers 
independently assessed abstracts, app titles, and descriptions against the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstracted data covered app name, research 
team or developer, palliative care element, target audience, and features for 
family support and caregiving functionality as defined by social convoy theory.
RESULTS: Overall, 10 articles describing 9 individual research-based apps and 22 
commercially available apps were identified. Commercially available apps were 
most commonly designed for both patients and social convoys, whereas the 
majority of research apps were designed for patient use only.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest there is an emerging presence of apps for patients 
and social convoys receiving palliative care; however, there are many needs for 
developers and researchers to address in the future. Although palliative care 
mHealth is a growing field, additional research is needed for apps that embrace 
a team approach to information sharing, target family- and caregiver-specific 
issues, promote access to palliative care, and are comprehensive of palliative 
needs.

Pain, Sports Participation, and Physical Function in Adolescents With 
Patellofemoral Pain and Osgood-Schlatter Disease: A Matched Cross-sectional 
Study.

Rathleff MS, Winiarski L, Krommes K, Graven-Nielsen T, Hölmich P, Olesen JL, 
Holden S, Thorborg K.

OBJECTIVE: To compare pain, physical activity, quality of life, strength, and 
knee function in adolescents with patellofemoral pain (PFP) and Osgood-Schlatter 
disease (OSD) to those in pain-free controls.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Self-report questionnaires were used to describe pain, physical 
activity, knee function, and quality of life in participants with PFP (n = 151) 
or OSD (n = 51) and in pain-free controls (n = 50) between 10 and 14 years of 
age. Hip and knee strength were measured by handheld dynamometry. Physical 
activity levels were measured using wearable accelerometers.
RESULTS: Adolescents were highly active (accumulating greater than 120 minutes 
of vigorous physical activity per day), with no differences between the OSD, 
PFP, and control groups. Adolescents with PFP or OSD scored 22 to 56 points 
lower (P<.001) on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales 
compared with controls, with the lowest scores on the "sport and recreation" and 
"quality of life" subscales. Adolescents with OSD had lower knee extension 
strength compared to controls (P<.05; effect size, 1.25). Adolescents with PFP 
had lower hip extension strength compared to controls (P<.05; effect size, 
0.73).
CONCLUSION: Adolescents with PFP or OSD had high physical activity levels, 
despite reporting long-standing knee pain and impaired knee function that 
impacted on their sports participation and quality of life. Clinicians treating 
adolescents with PFP or OSD may use these findings to target treatment to the 
most common deficits to restore sports-related function and sports 
participation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(3):149-157. Epub 6 Jan 2020.

BACKGROUND: There is marked interindividual variability in metabolism and 
resulting toxicity and effectiveness of drugs used for tuberculosis treatment. 
For isoniazid, mutations in the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene explain >88% 
of pharmacokinetic variability. However, weight-based dosing remains the norm 
globally. The potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of 
pharmacogenomic-guided therapy (PGT) are unknown.
METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model to project lifetime costs and 
benefits of isoniazid PGT for drug-susceptible tuberculosis in Brazil, South 
Africa, and India. PGT was modeled to reduce isoniazid toxicity among slow NAT2 
acetylators and reduce treatment failure among rapid acetylators. The genotyping 
test was assumed to cost the same as the GeneXpert test. The main outcomes were 
costs (2018 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: In Brazil, PGT gained 19 discounted life-years (23 QALYs) and cost $11 
064 per 1000 patients, a value of $476 per QALY gained. In South Africa, PGT 
gained 15 life-years (19 QALYs) and cost $33 182 per 1000 patients, a value of 
$1780 per QALY gained. In India, PGT gained 20 life-years (24 QALYs) and cost 
$13 195 per 1000 patients, a value of $546 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity 
analyses showed the cost-effectiveness to be robust to all input parameters. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were below per capita gross domestic product 
in all 3 countries in 99% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Isoniazid PGT improves health outcomes and would be cost-effective 
in the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in Brazil, South Africa, and 
India.

BACKGROUND: The mental health of the population consists of the three essential 
pillars of quality of life, economy, and society. Mental health services take 
care of the prevention and treatment of mental disorders and through them 
maintain, improve, and restore the mental health of the population. The purpose 
of this study is to describe the methodology for qualitative and quantitative 
evaluation and improvement of the mental health service system.
METHODS: This is a narrative review study that searches the literature to 
provide criteria, indicators, and methodology for evaluating and improving the 
quality of mental health services and the related qualitative and quantitative 
indicators. The bibliography was searched in popular databases PubMed, Google 
Scholar, CINAHL, using the keywords "mental", "health", "quality", "indicators", 
alone or in combinations thereof.
RESULTS: Important quality indicators of mental health services have been 
collected and presented, and modified where appropriate. The definition of each 
indicator is presented here, alongside its method of calculation and importance. 
Each indicator belongs to one of the eight dimensions of quality assessment: (1) 
Suitability of services, (2) Accessibility of patients to services, (3) 
Acceptance of services by patients, (4) Ability of healthcare professionals to 
provide services, (5) Efficiency of health professionals and providers, (6) 
Continuity of service over time (ensuring therapeutic continuity), (7) 
Efficiency of health professionals and services, (8) Safety (for patients and 
for health professionals).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Accessibility and acceptability of service indicators 
are important for the attractiveness of services related to their use by the 
population. Profitability indicators are important economic indicators that 
affect the viability and sustainability of services, factors that are now taken 
into account in any health policy. All of the indicators mentioned are related 
to public health, affecting the quality of life, morbidity, mortality, and life 
expectancy, directly or indirectly. The systematic measurement and monitoring of 
indicators and the measurement and quantification of quality through them, are 
the basis for evidence-based health policy for improvement of the quality of 
mental health services.

Introduction: The current study aimed to assess recent acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) mortality rates and trends in Romania between 1994 and 2017. 
This dataset is a necessity in the context of the current improvement of 
emergency protocols, medical addressability, and modernization of hospital 
infrastructure. Materials and Methods: The study is a retrospective analysis of 
an anonymized mortality database containing all deaths registered in Romania 
during 1994-2017. AMI crude mortality rates (CMR) and age-standardized mortality 
rates (ASMR) were calculated using the European Standard Population. Poisson 
regression was used for calculating the annual percentage change (APC) in 
mortality, subsequently used to make mortality predictions through the year 
2030. Results: There were 197,152 AMI deaths in women (39.3% of total AMI), and 
304,644 (60.7%) in men. Mortality rates were higher in men as compared with 
women for the entire time covered by the study. Based on the 1994-2017 ASMR 
dynamics, predictions for the year 2030 showed an overall AMI ASMR of 70.9 (95% 
CI 69.9-71.9), with gender analysis showing 46.8 (95% CI 45.8-47.9) in women and 
104.1 (95% CI 102.3-105.8) in men. Conclusion: Acute myocardial infarction 
age-standardized mortality rates decreased significantly in Romania between 1994 
and 2017 in close correlation to the implementation of national healthcare 
programs.

Nowadays, global warming, energy issues and environmental concern have forced 
energy production stakeholders to find new low carbon solutions. Photovoltaic 
technologies as renewable energy resources represent a competitive way for the 
transition from conventional fossil fuels towards a renewable energy economy. 
The highest renewable energy systems (RES) market share is based on silicon 
photovoltaic (Si-PV). The installed RES have rapidly increased over the last two 
decades, but, after the end of their service life, they will be disposed of. 
Therefore, the constant increase of the installed RES has attracted the global 
concern due to their impact on the environment and, most of all, due to the 
content of their valuable resources. However, the rational management of RES 
waste has not been addressed so far. The paper represents an extension of a 
previous work focused on Si-PV recycling by developing all waste hybrid 
composites. The extension research conducted in this paper is related to the 
influence of Si-PV characteristics on the mechanical performances and water 
stability of the hybrid composites. All waste hybrid composites developed by 
embedding different Si-PV grain sizes were tested before and after water 
immersion in terms of mechanical strength, interfacial adhesion, crystallinity 
and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The results 
revealed the better performance of such Si-PV composites compared to that of 
sieved composites even after long term water immersion. Therefore, high-content 
Si-PV hybrid composites could be developed without Si-PV powder sieving. Further 
on, all waste hybrid composites could be used as paving slabs, protective 
barriers for outdoor applications.

Pharmacists among Members of the Czech-Moravian Capuchin Province.

[Article in English]

Nesměrák K.

Based on a profound examination and evaluation of archival materials, the paper 
reconstructs the lives of eighteen pharmacists - members of the Czech-Moravian 
Capuchin Province from the 17th to the 19th century, of which sixteen served as 
monastic pharmacists. In addition to the identified biographical data (based on 
archival materials), the Latin summary reports on the life of a particular 
capuchin on the occasion of his death (the so-called elogia) from the Capuchin 
Provincial Chronicle (Annales capucinorum) are edited, together with their 
commented Czech translation. The discovered data allow a deeper insight into the 
pharmaceutical history of the Czech-Moravian Capuchin Province, where three 
monastic pharmacies were operated in Brno, Prague in Hrad&#269;any and Olomouc, 
and also a monastic pharmaceutical study was established. The published material 
also provides some new data on contemporary pharmaceutical practice, which are 
set in the context of literature. The paper illustrates the transfer of 
knowledge between the world of secular and monastic pharmacy at the places where 
future monastic pharmacists received their education (the pharmacies &#8220;The 
White Eagle&#8221; in Karlovy Vary, the pharmacy of brothers hospitallers in 
Prost&#283;jov, &#8220;The Golden Eagle&#8221; in Opava, &#8220;The White 
Unicorn&#8221; in the Old Town of Prague). The paper also highlights the 
intensive involvement of monastic pharmacists in the management of plague 
epidemics in the years 1680-1713 (often at the cost of their own lives), as well 
as the above-standard proximity to the patients in monastic hospitals in 
carrying out routine nursing and pharmacy practice. The paper adds sharper 
contours to the image of the pharmacist at that time by detailing the life 
stories of individual pharmacists (e.g., the previous career as a military 
surgeon and the iconographic circumstances of death, or the career extension in 
the form of participation in the order meetings in Rome). Analysis of the 
preserved manuscript Annotationes medicae Fr. Absolonis from the turn of the 
18th and 19th centuries not only introduces an interesting pharmaceutical 
memorabilia, but also illustrates the professional maturation of the last 
Capuchin pharmacist. In the final part of the paper, the data about twenty-two 
pharmacists who unsuccessfully tried to join the Capuchin Order are given. It 
not only demonstrates admission practice in the Capuchin order, in which 
spiritual interest outweighed the practical, but also bears witness to other 
pharmaceutical phenomena of the time, such as the fate of the pharmacist from 
the abolished Jesuit Order or the development of pharmacy in the Carthusian 
monastery in Valdice.

BACKGROUND: The traditional joint family system in a culturally diverse 
Pakistani society shows great respect and care for older population by the 
families and their generations. However, in the recent years the phenomenon of 
population ageing in Pakistan is rapidly increasing due to demographic shift 
influencing life expectancy, along with changes in socio-cultural values. This 
transition has resulted in institutionalization of the elderly as an emerging 
shelter alternative. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of the 
elderly people and to identify the reason which compelled them to reside in 
these shelter homes.
METHOD: A qualitative methodology, with a descriptive exploratory design, was 
adopted for the study. A purposive sample of 14 elderly males and females were 
selected, from two different shelter homes in Karachi, Pakistan. Semi-structured 
interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was done to 
extract the themes and comprehend the data.
RESULTS: Content analysis revealed five major themes: the circumstances of 
leaving home, experiences, and challenges to wellbeing before entering the care 
facility, coping with challenges, and decision to live in a shelter home. The 
analysis discovered that the elderly were experiencing lack of physical, 
psychological, emotional, and financial support from their family and children. 
It also indicated that migration of children for better career and employment 
opportunities, entrance of women into the workforce, and insensitive behaviour 
of children, left the senior citizens neglected and helpless. The findings also 
uncovered the challenges of unemployment and family disputes that the elderly 
had to face made them dependent, distressed, helpless, and lonely resulting in 
both their apparently willing and forceful decision to reside in shelter homes.
CONCLUSION: The findings point to need for further investigation of the 
identified areas in this study through qualitative and quantitative researches. 
There is a dire need for increasing public awareness through the social, 
electronic, and print media, and providing capacity building training to HCPs 
for the care of the elderly. The lobbying group can act as a catalyst in 
persuading the government officials for the execution of a policy on retirement, 
day care and subsidized provision of health services for the betterment of the 
elderly.

Clinical studies have indicated that obesity and diabetes are associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. Although the mechanisms 
underlying these associations remain elusive, the bidirectional interactions 
between obesity/diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be involved in them. 
Both obesity/diabetes and AD significantly reduce life expectancy. We generated 
AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice by crossing AppNL-F/wt knock-in mice and ob/ob 
mice to investigate whether amyloid-β (Aβ) affects the lifespan of ob/ob mice. 
AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice displayed the shortest lifespan compared to
