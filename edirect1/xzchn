Management of psoriasis in elderly patients may be challenging due to a small 
number of studies investigating this specific population. When treating a mature 
patient, special consideration should be given to multiple comorbidities, 
progressive functional impairment of several organs, immunosenescence, possible 
adverse effects, and polypharmacy. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and 
continuing rise in life expectancy, the prevalence of psoriasis among elderly is 
also expected to rise. Because many different therapies are available for 
treatment of psoriasis, we have reviewed those that have been investigated in 
the aging population. Although biologics have revolutionized the therapy of 
psoriasis due to targeted mechanism of action, high efficacy and low rate of 
adverse events, studies on the elderly population with psoriasis are scarce. 
Further clinical research and development of specific treatment guidelines in 
geriatric population are needed to optimize the therapeutic approach in this 
population.

OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) remain reliable substitutes for permanent 
hemodialysis access in scenarios that preclude the placement of native 
arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). The majority of AVGs are constructed of expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), which is relatively inexpensive and readily 
available, but synthetic AVGs have poor patency rates. On the other hand, 
biologic grafts confer an advantage by virtue of their inherent similarity to 
the native human vasculature. However, evidence to support the current 
preference of synthetic conduits over biologic grafts in clinical practice is 
scarce. The aim of this protocol is to propose a contemporary re-evaluation and 
comparison between ePTFE and bovine carotid artery (BCA) grafts.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial is being conducted at an 
academic hospital center. A total of 100 patients at least 18 years of age and 
undergoing AVG placement will be recruited and prospectively randomized into two 
parallel groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients eligible to receive AVF 
and those with a known allergic reaction or history of intolerance to any ePTFE 
or BCA component will not be included in the study. Moreover, patients with a 
recent active infection at the site of previous AVG placement and patients with 
a bleeding disorder, an active malignant disease, or a life expectancy <1 year 
or who refuse blood transfusion and pregnant women will be excluded. Patients 
will receive either BCA (experimental) or standard ePTFE grafts (control) in 
compliance with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality 
Initiative guidelines for AVG creation. Primary end points include primary, 
primary assisted, secondary, and functional patency at 1 year and 2 years after 
graft placement. Secondary outcomes include complications (pseudoaneurysms, 
infections, and steal syndrome) and reintervention rates during the first and 
second postoperative years. Outcomes will be assessed and documented every 
6 months.
RESULTS: Once the study is completed, analysis of the data will be performed 
using univariate methods, and Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional 
regression analyses will be employed to evaluate and to compare outcomes between 
BCA and ePTFE over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a functional and durable dialysis vascular access 
is crucial in the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease and is a 
challenging quest for vascular surgeons. The proposed study compares the 
outcomes of synthetic and biologic AVG options in patients who are poor 
candidates for a native AVF. This will help derive contemporary evidence and 
improve the care of vascular access patients.

As the life expectancy of the world population increases, osteoporotic (OP) 
fracture risk increase. Therefore in the present study a novel injectable 
thermo-responsive hydrogel loaded with microspheres of 17β-estradiol, 
microspheres of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and plasma rich in growth 
factors (PRGF) was applied locally to regenerate a calvaria critical bone defect 
in OP female rats. Three systems were characterized: Tetronic® 1307 (T-1307) 
reinforced with alginate (T-A), T-A with PRGF and T-A-PRGF with microspheres. 
The addition of the microspheres increased the viscosity but the temperature for 
the maximum viscosity did not change (22-24 °C). The drugs were released during 
6 weeks in one fast phase (three days) followed by a long slow phase. In vivo 
evaluation was made in non-OP and OP rats treated with T-A, T-A with 
microspheres of 17β-estradiol (T-A-βE), T-A-βE prepared with PRGF (T-A-PRGF-βE), 
T-A-βE with microspheres of BMP-2 (T-A-βE-BMP-2) and the combination of the 
three (T-A-PRGF-βE-BMP). After 12 weeks, histological and histomorphometric 
analyzes showed a synergic effect due to the addition of BMP-2 to the T-A-βE 
formulation. The PRGF did not increased the bone repair. The new bone filling 
the OP defect was less mineralized than in the non-OP groups.

Objectives: Treatment of HIV infection has evolved from a single antiretroviral 
agent to combination therapy, which has dramatically improved both the quality 
of life and life expectancy of affected patients. The aim of this study was to 
review HIV treatment-associated dermatological conditions observed in adult 
patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a single tertiary care 
referral centre over time. Methods: We reviewed the files of HIV-positive 
patients seen at the Dermatology Department, AIDS Clinic of the Andreas Syggros 
Hospital, Athens, Greece who had initiated ART from 1988 to 2013, for evidence 
of dermatological conditions commonly associated with HIV-related medication. 
Results: Among a cohort of 1329 HIV-positive patients (1155 men and 174 women), 
352 (299 men and 53 women) presented with at least one dermatological condition, 
with a total of 423 conditions diagnosed that could be attributed to HIV-related 
medication. Lipodystrophy (47.42%), and maculopapular (MP) rash (40.6%) were 
most commonly diagnosed. There were three incidence peaks for these reactions, 
which reflected the different types of ART and HIV-related drugs commonly used 
at the time. After 2006, the number of these dermatological conditions declined 
(15.1% of cases) with the availability of newer ART regimens. Conclusions: Early 
ART was accompanied with a high incidence of adverse skin reactions, which have 
decreased over time in association with overall better tolerated treatment 
regimens for HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Multiple studies suggest that internal carotid artery stenting can 
be performed safely in octogenarians with low periprocedural complication rates. 
However, great concern still exists as to whether these patients will gain 
long-term benefits from this procedure given their advanced age and uncertain 
life expectancy. We decided to conduct a retrospective study to determine 
short-and long-term clinical outcomes and to analyze survival duration in this 
population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-nine consecutive elderly patients with either 
symptomatic or asymptomatic stenosis ≥70% underwent 86 procedures. Immediate and 
late outcomes, as well as survival data, were analyzed retrospectively. Mean age 
was 83.1 ± 2.7 years. Mean survival was 49.3 ± 10.1 months. A complete 
neurological assessment was obtained at 1 and 2 years in 100% of patients, at 
3 years in 90.7% of patients and at 5 years in 84.8% of patients. Two major and 
one minor ischemic strokes occurred during the periprocedural period. No death, 
myocardial infarction or intracranial hemorrhage was recorded. The mean 
follow-up period was 55.4 ± 24.6 months. Four patients experienced a minimum of 
1 year of follow-up, and the longest is 8 years. Among the patients with the 
longest follow-up time, 6 had ischemic strokes, of which 2 were fatal. In total, 
17 deaths occurred. Four patients experienced dementia without stroke. Survival 
at 3 and 5 years was estimated to be 90% and 73%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that stenting in octogenarians was safe and 
effective during the periprocedural period. Long-term follow-up showed a low 
rate of fatal and nonfatal stroke, and patients survived long enough to benefit 
from the procedure. However, it was associated with a relatively high rate of 
long-term event. Though carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive 
procedure, it should still be performed with great caution and only in carefully 
selected patients. The present study suggested that in this age population, 
carotid artery stenting might be considered as a revascularization option.

Perioperative interventions aimed at decreasing costs and improving outcomes 
have become increasingly popular in recent years. Anesthesiologists are often 
faced with a choice among different treatment strategies with little data 
available on the comparative cost-effectiveness. We performed a systematic 
review of the English language literature between 1980 and 2014 to identify 
cost-effectiveness analyses of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine 
interventions. We excluded interventions related to critical care or pediatric 
anesthesiology, and articles on interventions not normally ordered or performed 
by anesthesiologists. Of the >5000 cost-effectiveness analyses published to 
date, only 28 were applicable to anesthesiology and perioperative medicine and 
met inclusion criteria. Multidisciplinary interventions were the most 
cost-effective overall; 8 of 8 interventions were "dominant" (improved outcomes, 
reduced cost) or cost-effective, including accelerated, standardized 
perioperative recovery pathways, and perioperative delirium prevention bundles. 
Intraoperative measures were dominant in 3 of 5 cases, including spinal 
anesthesia for benign abdominal hysterectomy. With regard to prevention of 
perioperative infection, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
decolonization was dominant or cost-effective in 2 of 2 studies. Three studies 
assessing various antibiotic prophylaxis regimens had mixed results. Autologous 
blood donation was not found to be cost-effective in 5 of 7 studies, and 
intraoperative cell salvage therapy was also not cost-effective in 2 of 2 
reports. Overall, there remains a paucity of cost-effectiveness literature in 
anesthesiology, particularly relating to intraoperative interventions and 
multidisciplinary perioperative interventions. Based on the available studies, 
multidisciplinary perioperative optimization interventions such as accelerated, 
standardized perioperative recovery pathways, and perioperative delirium 
prevention bundles tended to be most cost-effective. Our review demonstrates 
that there is a need for more rigorous cost-effective analyses in many areas of 
anesthesiology and that anesthesiologists should continue to lead collaborative, 
multidisciplinary efforts in perioperative medicine.

BACKGROUND: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (designated as carbidopa-levodopa 
enteral suspension in the United States) provides stable plasma levodopa 
concentrations and reduces motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease 
patients through continuous delivery of levodopa via percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrojejunostomy. We report long-term safety and efficacy outcomes from an 
open-label phase 3 treatment program.
METHODS: PD patients (n = 262) who completed a 12-week double-blind study and 
its 52-week open-label extension or a separate 54-week open-label study were 
enrolled in this ongoing phase 3 open-label, multinational study (NCT00660673). 
Safety and efficacy assessments were collected every 6 months.
RESULTS: Mean total duration of exposure to levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel 
was 4.1 years (range, 1.2 to 6.9 years). The overall discontinuation rate was 
34% (average annual discontinuation rate, 10%). Although most patients (94%) 
reported an adverse event, the rate of adverse events decreased over time; 53% 
experienced a serious adverse event. Of patients in this extension study, 54% 
required jejunal tube replacement during the study, and 37% required 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement. Most patients were on 
levodopa monotherapy. Patients maintained reductions in "off" time and increases 
in mean "on" time without dyskinesia from initial levodopa-carbidopa intestinal 
gel infusion to he study end point (P < 0.001; n = 81). Activities of daily 
living and quality-of-life assessments demonstrated significant improvements 
that persisted through the study.
CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study demonstrates sustained and clinically 
meaningful benefits from levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in advanced PD 
patients. Although adverse event rates decreased over time, vigilance is 
required for device-related complications and adverse events. © 2018 The

BACKGROUND: Frequent migraine with four or more headache days per month is a 
common, disabling neurovascular disease. From a US societal perspective, this 
analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) 
for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin 
gene-related peptide receptor.
METHODS: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the 
incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price 
range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises "on preventive 
treatment", "off preventive treatment", and "death" health states across a 
10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive 
treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least 
one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in 
monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network 
meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously 
published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum 
erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of 
$100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as 
choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, 
and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated.
RESULTS: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) 
and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an 
average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds 
of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. 
VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity 
ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with 
onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine.
CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect 
costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC.

The sensitivity of the 15 indicators included in a complex aggregation method 
(Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool), applied to a case study in the 
Caspian Sea in Iran, has been studied to discriminate between areas impacted and 
non-impacted by bathing activities. Two methods were used: (i) the 15 indicators 
were grouped into four groups (physicochemical, bacteria, plankton, and benthos) 
and each group was investigated separately (one-way sensitivity analysis), 
calculating NEAT values after omitting each group independently; and (ii) 
indicators were selected randomly, using 1000 Monte Carlo iterations, and 
removing from 1 to 14 indicators at each iteration. The results revealed that 
the abundance of Pontogammarus was the single indicator that made the difference 
in assessing the status among locations, differentiating bathing and non-bathing 
areas. Hence, this indicator is regarded as a monitoring element detecting the 
impacts produced by a management measure (beach nourishment) taken by the 
authorities to maintain the bathing activity.

Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been used to enhance 
bioavailability and biological activities. Chitosan incorporating curcumin can 
serve as a biocompatible substitute for metallic nanoparticles in preventing 
biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans and plaque on teeth. The interactions 
between chitosan nanoparticle as a carrier and curcumin, a natural antibacterial 
agent, were simulated. The binding conformation between curcumin-chitosan was 
obtained using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm in Autodock™ software in 
chitosan nanoparticle. The interaction stability was examined in the molecular 
dynamic stages, with isothermal-isobaric ensemble in the CHARMM Force Field. The 
results showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the root mean square 
fluctuations (RMSF) for all complex's atoms were relaxed after 4ns (RMSD for the 
all-atoms was 26.81±0.1 (Å); RMSF 1.13±0.02Å). For each section, the estimation 
of RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, inter-H bond and other analysis confirmed 
that, during the first interval;10ns, there was a stable binding between the two 
sections. Although all bindings disappeared from 10 to 20ns, the curcumin was 
trapped inside the chitosan nanoparticles, and no release took place until 20ns, 
after which the curcumin began to release. This trend suggests that chitosan 
nanoparticle has ability to carry the curcumin.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) refers to the number of years that an 
individual is expected to survive. Emphasis is frequently placed on the 
relationship between LE and the conditions under which a population lives, but 
fewer studies have investigated the relationship between stress factors 
associated with specific professions and their effects on LE. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate Brazilian neurosurgeons' life expectancies (BNLEs) and 
compare them with those of physicians (both Brazilian and foreign) from other 
fields, as well as with Brazilian nondoctors.
METHODS: The Brazilian Society of Neurosurgery death registry was used to obtain 
data that compared LEs from non-neurosurgeon physicians, as described in the 
national and international literature. BNLEs were also compared with the LEs of 
Brazilian citizens.
RESULTS: Fifty-one neurosurgeons died between 2009 and 2016. All were males. The 
mean age at death was 68.31 ± 17.71 years. Among all-cause mortality, the 
breakdown was 20% cardiovascular diseases, 39% malignancies, 10% external 
factors, 6% gastrointestinal disorders, 12% neurologic illnesses, and 14% 
unknown causes. BNLE was shorter than LE of male Brazilian citizens.
CONCLUSIONS: LE was similar among neurosurgeons and other doctors but shorter 
compared with Brazilian citizens. Further research is needed to provide data 
that can add to and confirm these results.

BACKGROUND: The palliative prognostic index (PPI) is a commonly used tool to 
predict the life expectancy in palliative care patients. However, there is no 
universal cutoff, and the accuracy of different cutoffs varies. Therefore, we 
conducted this meta-analysis to explore the validity and accuracy of different 
PPI scores for different survival time in palliative care setting.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and Chinese CNKI databases were 
searched to identify studies using the PPI as a prognostic tool to predict 
survival time in palliative care. We calculated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and subgroup analyses were also 
conducted by different cutoffs. After extracting data, we estimated the pooled 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 
value.
RESULTS: We identified 15 studies with 7455 assessments. Seven of these studies 
were synthesized for a combined HR. The pooled HR was 1.94 (95% CI 1.54-2.44) 
when cutoffs were 2 and 4, and 2.34 (95% CI 1.50-3.66) when cutoffs were 4 and 
6. Of all the studies, 13 studies reported their accuracy, of which four studies 
were assessed by meta-analysis. The sensitivity of the PPI for 3-week survival 
ranged from 51 to 92% and specificity ranged from 60.0 to 94.0%, respectively. 
The sensitivity and specificity of the PPI for 6-week survival were from 46.0 to 
89.1% and from 51.7 to 84.4%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and 
specificity of the PPI for 3-week survival were 68% (6 as cutoff) and 76% (6 as 
cutoff), respectively. As for 6-week survival prediction, the pooled sensitivity 
and specificity were 68% (4 as cutoff) and 82% (4 as cutoff), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The PPI is a useful prognosticator of life expectancy of patients in 
palliative care, especially for patients with short survival time. However, 
there were no universal cutoff, and the predicted life span varies. Our data 
eliminated that using 4 and 6 as cutoffs can better predict the patients' 
survival time for 3 or 6 weeks. Due to small number of studies and poor 
qualities of them, result may alter as more studies with better quality are 
enrolled in the future.

PURPOSE: Beta-thalassemia major is a severe, congenital hematological disorder 
and, if untreated, leads to early mortality. Progress in therapeutical 
strategies improved clinical outcomes and life expectancy; however, increased 
survival led to the development of new disorders, including endocrinopathies. 
Little is known on the possible impairment of adrenocortical function, a 
potentially life-threatening condition, in long-term thalassaemic survivors. We 
therefore decided to assess adrenal reserve and the value of salivary cortisol 
during ACTH stimulation in the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency in 
adult patients with β-thalassemia major.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 72 adults with β-thalassemia major. 
Patients were tested with 1 µg ACTH for serum and salivary cortisol.
RESULTS: Subnormal serum cortisol responses to ACTH stimulation (i.e., 
<500 nmol/l) were registered in 15 out of 72 patients. Salivary cortisol 
increased in parallel with serum cortisol and a clear-cut positive correlation 
was detected at each timepoint. Moreover, peak salivary cortisol values after 
ACTH stimulation were significantly lower in patients with impaired adrenal 
reserve (513.6 ± 52.33 vs. 914.1 ± 44.04 nmol/l p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results attest to the need for testing for adrenal 
insufficiency among adult thalassaemic patients, as up to 20% presented impaired 
adrenal reserve. Salivary and serum cortisol levels during stimulation with ACTH 
were closely correlated and the use of salivary cortisol sampling during ACTH 
testing may represent a surrogate to serum cortisol in these patients.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies showed that offering BRCA mutation testing to 
population subgroups at high risk of harbouring the mutation may be cost 
effective, yet no evidence is available for low- or middle-income countries 
(LMIC) and in Asia. We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing 
in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability of 
harbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or 
routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 
early-stage breast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would 
decide whether to accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, 
oophorectomy, tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series of 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime and 
cost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 per 
patient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. The 
ICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and 
utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY, 
99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer 
patients identified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost 
effective compared to RCS in Malaysia.

PURPOSE: The classification systems by Anderson and D'Alonzo, Effendi, Benzel 
and others have limitations when it comes to morphologically categorising 
fractures of the second cervical vertebral body (C2) that present with or 
without an additional fracture of the dens or with or without an extension of 
the fracture line into the vertebral arch and displacement. Currently, there are 
no definitive recommendations for the treatment of fractures at the junction of 
the dens with the vertebral body of C2 on the basis of outcome and stability 
data. Depending on patient anatomy, either anterior or posterior approaches can 
be used to fuse C1 and C2 and to achieve definitive surgical stabilisation. The 
anterior management of C2 fractures without C1-C2 fusion has the theoretical 
advantage that it preserves rotational motion at this motion segment and that 
the anterior approach is associated with lower morbidity. In the study presented 
here, we followed up a group of our patients who underwent anterior miniplate 
fixation for C2 fractures.
METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent fixation of C2 fractures with titanium 
miniplates (Medartis Hand fixation system, 2.0 or 2.3 mm) that were placed using 
a submental approach. To our knowledge, this construct has not yet been 
described in the literature. Where necessary, this procedure was combined with 
screw fixation of the dens as described by Böhler. We retrospectively analysed 
operative reports and medical records, evaluated the patients' health status 
using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36), and performed clinical 
follow-up examinations.
RESULTS: From January 2009 to June 2015, 226 traumatic lesions of the cervical 
spine were managed at our institution in the inpatient setting. Ninety-two 
patients underwent conservative treatment. Of the 134 cases that required 
surgery for fractures and instability, 67 involved the C0-C3 motion segments. In 
15 patients, stability was achieved using an anterior miniplate or miniscrews 
alone (n = 4) or in addition to other techniques (n = 11). Anderson and D'Alonzo 
type II and III dens fractures with involvement of the body or lateral mass of 
C2 accounted for eight cases. Effendi type II body fractures with or without 
instability were seen in four cases. There was no perioperative mortality and 
morbidity in this patient group. All fractures healed and stability was achieved 
in all cases. No patient had neurological deficits or required revision surgery. 
An assessment of postoperative quality of life showed that 11 patients (7 men, 4 
women) with a mean age of 57 (± 5.3) years reached an SF-36 score that was 
normal for their age group after a mean period of 33 (± 6.3) months following 
their injury. Compared to a group of healthy subjects, the patients had a range 
of motion that was limited only at the extremes.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with appropriate indications, anterior fixation with 
miniplates alone or additionally is a further useful treatment option in the 
management of fractures at the junction of the dens with the vertebral body of 
C2. Since this type of treatment preserves motion at the C1-C2 motion segment 
after fracture healing and since an anterior approach is associated with less 
surgical trauma than posterior instrumentation, the technique presented here 
should be included in a discussion on (surgical) treatment options. These slides 
can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

BACKGROUND: Scleroderma is a rare connective tissue disorder characterised by 
inflammation, vasculopathy and excessive fibrosis. Patients with scleroderma are 
known to have decreased life expectancy.
AIM: To investigate changes in life expectancy in patients with scleroderma over 
a 30-year period.
METHODS: Utilising the South Australian Scleroderma Register, deceased patients 
were identified. We examined changes in age of death and duration of disease in 
these patients over three time periods: 1985-1994, 1995-2004 and 2005-2015. 
Analyses of scleroderma subtypes were performed, and comparisons were made to 
the general South Australian population.
RESULTS: A total of 413 deceased patients was identified. Females were 
overrepresented 315 to 98; 265 had limited scleroderma, 90 diffuse and 22 
overlap disease. Over 30 years, the mean age of death improved from 66.4 to 74.5 
years (P < 0.001). Duration of disease improved from 12.1 to 22.9 years (P < 
0.001). Improvement in survival was seen in limited (P = 0.001), diffuse (P = 
0.04) and overlap (P = 0.04) subgroups. The increase in survival was only seen 
for female (9.8 ± 4.2 years) but not male (1.4 ± 6.7 years) patients.
CONCLUSION: Over the last 30 years, survival has significantly improved for 
female but not male patients. As no disease-modifying drugs have consistently 
been shown to alter disease course, this improvement is likely attributable to 
general improvements in medical care, including that of scleroderma-related 
complications. While the life expectancy for limited disease is now close to 
that of the general population, patients with diffuse and overlap disease 
continue to suffer from significant early mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Embrace, an integrated primary 
care service for older adults.
DATA SOURCES: Care and support claims from health care insurers, long-term care 
administration, and municipalities for enrolled older adults between 2011 and 
2013.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1,456 older adults, listed with 15 general 
practitioners practices in the Netherlands, were stratified into risk profiles 
("Robust," "Frail," and "Complex care needs") and randomized to Embrace or 
care-as-usual groups. Incremental costs were calculated per quality-adjusted 
life year, per day able to age in place, and per percentage point risk profile 
improvement.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total average costs were higher for Embrace compared to 
care-as-usual. Differences in health-associated outcomes were small and not 
statistically significant. Probabilities that Embrace is cost-effective were 
below 80 percent, except for "risk profile improvements" within risk profile 
"Complex care needs." Complete case analysis resulted in smaller differences in 
total average costs across conditions and differences in health-associated 
outcomes remained small.
CONCLUSIONS: According to current standards, Embrace is not considered cost 
effective after 12 months. However, it could be considered worthwhile in terms 
of "risk profile improvements" for older adults with "Complex care needs," if 
society is willing to invest substantially.

PURPOSE: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography has been shown 
to significantly reduce lung cancer-related mortality in high-risk patients. 
However, patients diagnosed with lung cancer are typically older and often have 
multiple age- and smoking-related comorbidities. As a result, cancer screening 
in older adults remains a complex decision, requiring careful consideration of 
patients' risk characteristics and life expectancy to ensure that the benefits 
outweigh the risks of screening. In this review, we evaluate the evidence 
regarding lung cancer screening, with a focus on older patients.
METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies evaluating the 
clinical outcomes of lung cancer screening. The key words used in our search 
included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), screening, older, comorbidities, 
computed tomography, and survival. While we primarily looked for articles 
specific to older patients, we also focused on subgroup analysis in older 
patients in larger studies. Finally, we reviewed all relevant guidelines 
regarding lung cancer screening.
FINDINGS: Guidelines recommend that lung cancer screening be considered in 
adults aged 55 to 80 years who are at high risk based on smoking history (ie, 
30-pack-year smoking history; having smoked within the past 15 years). Patients 
who fit these criteria have been shown to have a 20% reduction in lung 
cancer-related mortality with the use of low-dose computed tomography versus 
chest radiography. High rates of false-positive results and potential 
overdiagnoses were also observed. Therefore, screening is generally not 
recommended in adults with severe comorbidities or short life expectancy, who 
may experience limited benefit and higher risks with screening. However, several 
studies have shown a benefit with continued lung cancer screening with 
appropriate selection of older individuals at the highest risk and with the 
lowest comorbidities.
IMPLICATIONS: Older patients experience the highest risk for lung cancer 
incidence and mortality, and stand to be the most likely to benefit from lung 
cancer screening. However, careful consideration must be given to higher rates 
of false-positives and overdiagnosis in this population, as well as tolerability 
of surgery and competing risks for death from other causes. The appropriate 
selection of older individuals for lung cancer screening can be greatly 
optimized by using validated risk-based targeting.

INTRODUCTION: Metastatic bone disease is the most common neoplastic process that 
affects the skeletal system. Eighty percent of bone metastases come from 
carcinomas of the breast, lung, kidney, thyroid and prostate. The Katagiri scale 
enables an estimation of the survival of patients based on the presence or 
absence of visceral metastases, multiple bone metastases and functional status
