combination of wire mesh screws and titanium miniplates. Postoperative imaging 
demonstrated bony approximation and successful evacuation of traumatic 
hemorrhage. The patient remains functionally and neurologically intact apart 
from a sluggishly responsive left eye presumed to result from a left optic nerve 
or ciliary ganglion lesion. Although rapid reconstruction of complex 
cranial-orbital trauma and hematoma evacuation can permit acceptable gross 
functional neurological outcome following massive trauma, orbital fracture and 
subsequent hemorrhagic processes may be the nidus of neurological sequelae in 
this complex traumatic constellation. Thus, alterations in surgical approach and 
reconstruction are appropriate in order to maximize neurological function while 
supporting restoration of cosmetic space.

Objective: To investigate the clinical features, treatment methods, and outcomes 
of fulminant myocarditis (FM) in children. Methods: The clinical data of 23 
children with FM hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division 
of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China 
(Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital from 
January 2011 to September 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 
23 patients analyzed, 10 were male and 13 were female. The patients aged from 6 
months to 14 years old (6.5 ± 3.4 years), and 18 patients were over 3 years old. 
There were 14 cases with respiratory symptoms, 16 cases with gastrointestinal 
symptoms, 15 cases with neurological symptoms, and 19 cases with hypoperfusion 
manifestations. Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (CTnI) levels 
were increased in 19 and 21 cases, respectively. Electrocardiography (ECG) 
showed ST-T changes in 18 cases and atrioventricular blocks (AVB) in 15 cases. 
Echocardiography (ECHO) showed cardiac chamber enlargement (CCE) in eight cases, 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction in five cases, decrease in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in four cases, reduction in wall motion in 
two cases, and pericardial effusion in seven cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIG) and glucocorticoids were administered to 19 and 20 patients, 
respectively. Fourteen patients were treated with temporary pacemakers, one 
patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), one patient 
received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and one patient received 
ECMO combined with CRRT. Twenty patients improved at discharge, and three 
patients died. Conclusion: Preschool and school-age children showing 
hypoperfusion symptoms, such as paleness, cold, clammy limbs, and capillary 
refill time (CRT) extension, accompanied by vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, 
convulsions, and other symptoms, should be carefully examined for FM. CK-MB, 
CTnI, ECG, and echocardiogram need to be performed at the earliest opportunity. 
In the early stages of FM, vital signs should be actively monitored, high-dose 
IVIG and glucocorticoids should be administered, and life support technologies 
such as temporary pacemakers, ECMO, and CRRT should be used to increase the 
survival rate of children with FM as needed.

BACKGROUND: Access to antiretroviral treatment has improved the life expectancy 
of HIV-positive patients, most often associated with a desire to limit 
childbearing. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) commonly have unmet need for 
contraception and could be at risk of unintended pregnancy. Preventing 
unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV are effective strategies to 
eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess unmet need for limiting 
childbirth and its associated factors among women living with HIV in Togo.
METHODS: This facility based cross-sectional study was conducted, between June 
and August 2016, among WLHIV in their reproductive age (15-49 years) in HIV-care 
settings in Centrale and Kara regions Data was collected using a structured and 
pretested questionnaire. WLHIV who desired to limit childbirth but not using 
contraception were considered to have unmet need of birth limitations. 
Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance were 
performed to identify associated factors with unmet needs. A multi-model 
averaging approach was used to estimate the degree of the association between 
these factors and the unmet need of birth limitations.
RESULTS: A total of 443 WLHIV were enrolled, with mean age of 34.5 years 
(standard deviation [SD] = 7.0). Among them 244 (55.1%) were in couple and 200 
(45.1%) had at least the secondary level of education. 39.1% were followed-up in 
a private healthcare facility. At the time of the survey, 40.0% did not desire 
childbearing but only 9.0% (95% CI [6.7-12.1]) of them expressed unmet needs for 
limiting childbirth. In multivariable analysis, associated factors with unmet 
needs of birth limitations were: being aged 35 years or more (adjusted 
prevalence ratio (aPR) = 3.11, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) [1.52-6.38]), 
living in couple (aPR = 2.32 [1.15-4.65]), living in Kara region (aPR = 0.10 
[0.01-0.76]), being followed in a private healthcare facility (aPR = 
0.08[0.01-0.53]) and having severe HIV symptoms (aPR = 3.50 [1.31-9.37]).
CONCLUSION: Even though the unmet need for births limitation was relatively low 
among WLHIV in Togo, interventions to improve more access to contraceptive 
methods, and targeting 35 to 49 years old women, those in couple or followed in 
the public healthcare facilities would contribute to the eradication of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Therapeutic proteins (TPs) are a diverse drug class that include monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs), recombinantly expressed enzymes, hormones and growth factors, 
cytokines (e.g. chemokines, interleukins, interferons), as well as a wide range 
of engineered fusion scaffolds containing IgG1 Fc domain for half-life 
extension. As the pharmaceutical industry advances more potent and selective 
protein-based medicines through discovery and into the clinical stages of 
development, it has become widely appreciated that a comprehensive understanding 
of the mechanisms of TP biodistribution can aid this endeavor. This review aims 
to highlight the literature that has advanced our understanding of the 
determinants of TP biodistribution. A particular emphasis is placed on the 
multi-faceted role of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in mAb and Fc-fusion 
protein disposition. In addition, characterization of the TP-target interaction 
at the cell-level is discussed as an essential strategy to establish 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships that may lead to more 
informed human dose projections during clinical development. Methods for 
incorporation of tissue and cell-level parameters defining these characteristics 
into higher-order mechanistic and semi-mechanistic PK models will also be 
presented.

The objective of this study was to analyze the mRNA transcription levels of ten 
functional genes of P-glycoproteins (P-gp) in free life stages, eggs and 
infective larvae (L3) and in endoparasitic stages, fourth larval stage (L4) and 
adult males of two native isolates of Haemonchus contortus: resistant and 
susceptible to IVM. The IVM resistant isolate was obtained from sheep naturally 
infected with H. contortus, and the susceptible isolate (with no pressure to 
IVM) conserved since 1990. The lethal effect of IVM was evaluated under in vitro 
conditions, which showed significant differences between susceptible and 
resistant H. contortus L3 isolates (P < 0.01). The IVM susceptible isolate 
revealed a lethal effect of 79.22% at 11.42 mM, whereas that resistant isolate 
showed no lethal effect at any of the four assessed concentrations (1.43, 2.85, 
5.71 and 11.42 mM) of IVM. The expression levels of ten Hco-pgp genes (1, 2, 3, 
4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16) were evaluated in the resistant isolate of H. 
contortus and compared to the susceptible isolate (as control), using two 
constitutive genes (GAPDH and β-tubulin). Up-regulation at two statistical 
significant values (P ≤ 0.05, 0.1) was the criterion to associate IVM resistance 
with the free life and endoparasitic stages of H. contortus. The expression 
levels in H. contortus adult nematodes showed 5.64 to 127.56-fold increase for 
Hco-pgp genes 1, 9, 12, 14, and 16, followed by an increase for Hco-pgp-2 
(49.75-fold) and Hco-pgp-10 (106.40-fold) in L4, and for Hco-pgp-16 (2.90-fold) 
in eggs (P ≤ 0.05). In addition, high expression levels with P < 0.1 were 
detected in H. contortus L3, L4, and adults for Hco-pgp genes 1, 4, 11, 12, and 
16, with changes ranging from 2.17 to 29.72-fold. In conclusion, the highest 
expression was observed in the adult stage of H. contortus, and the most 
frequent gene with a significant P-value was Hco-pgp-16, revealing it plays an 
important role in IVM resistance.

OBJECTIVE: During the 2013-2016 period, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika affected 
more than 1 million people in Colombia. These arboviruses and their chronic 
manifestations pose a public health challenge. Therefore, we estimated the 
burden of disease by Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika in Colombia between 2013 and 
2016.
METHODS: An exploratory ecological study was carried out using the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a unit of measure. The mortality 
databases of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and the 
morbidity databases of the National Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) 
were used. Deaths and cases for each arbovirus were grouped and then adjusted to 
control biases. Subsequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: In the 2013-2016 period, 491,629.2 DALYs were lost due to arboviruses 
in Colombia. By disease, 26.6% of the total DALYs were caused by Dengue, 71.3% 
by Chikungunya, and the remaining 2.2%, by Zika. The majority of DALYs (68.2%) 
were caused by chronic complications. Five out of 32 departments (Valle del 
Cauca, Tolima, Norte de Santander, Huila, and Bolívar) contributed 50.5% of 
total DALYs.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease by arboviruses in the 2013-2016 period 
exceeded the burden of other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis in Colombia. Public health efforts must be made to mitigate new 
epidemics of these arboviruses.

Accelerometry analysis options produce large differences in lifestyle physical 
activity measurement.

Mueller M(1), Chimenti R, Merkle S, Frey-Law L.

Iowa City, IA, United States of America.

Objective measurement of physical activity (PA) using accelerometers has become 
increasingly popular across recreational and clinical applications. However, the 
effects of multiple processing algorithms, filters, and corrections on PA 
measurement variability may be underappreciated.
OBJECTIVE: To examine how lifestyle PA estimates are impacted by multiple 
available scoring methods.
APPROACH: Wrist-worn accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X+) were worn by 132 adults 
(87 F) having various activity levels for one week. Lifestyle PA was assessed 
across four PA domains: daily energy expenditure (EE); active EE; 
moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA); and steps using 1-5 algorithms per domain, 
with/without wrist correction and low-frequency-extension (LFE). Estimates were 
compared to self-report (International Physical Activity Questionnaire).
MAIN RESULTS: PA estimates differed between algorithms with variable but 
frequently large effect sizes (d = 0.08-1.88). The wrist correction reduced PA 
estimates across all domains (p < 0.05, d = 0.26-3.04) except step counts and 
one daily EE algorithm (d = 0.0). Conversely, the LFE increased step counts (d = 
1.44, p < 0.05) but minimally affected all other outcomes (d = 0.08-0.20, p < 
0.05). Correlations between objective and self-reported PA were small to 
moderate (ρ = 0.22-0.45) and decreased with the wrist correction.
SIGNIFICANCE: Measurement of PA using accelerometry is highly dependent on 
algorithm and filter selection; previously validated methods are therefore not 
interchangeable. Users should take caution when interpreting absolute PA 
estimates, and reporting standards should require detailed methodology 
disclosure to optimize comparisons across studies.

Dynactin-1 (DCTN1)-related Parkinson-plus disorder (Perry syndrome) is an 
autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterised by 
levodopa-resistant parkinsonism, weight loss, mood change and central 
hypoventilation. Ventilatory insufficiency is the predominant cause of death. It 
has been previously described in 87 people from 20 families with a worldwide 
distribution. It is now recognised as a distinct TDP-43 proteinopathy caused by 
a pathological mutation in DCTN1. Its rarity and clinical overlap with other 
neurodegenerative diseases increase the risk of delayed or incorrect diagnosis. 
Ventilatory support can improve life expectancy but this depends upon its 
recognition; overall its prognosis remains poor. We report a patient with 
DCTN1-related Parkinson-plus disorder, in whom genetic confirmation came only 
after death.

OBJECTIVE: To identify specific health care areas whose optimization could 
improve population health in the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba and Curaçao.
METHODS: Comparative observational study using mortality and population data of 
the Dutch Caribbean islands and the Netherlands. Mortality trends were 
calculated, then analyzed with Joinpoint software, for the period 1988-2014. 
Life expectancies were computed using abridged life tables for the most recent 
available data of all territories (2005-2007). Life expectancy differences 
between the Dutch Caribbean and the Netherlands were decomposed into 
cause-specific contributions using Arriaga's method.
RESULTS: During the period 1988-2014, levels of amenable mortality have been 
consistently higher in Aruba and Curaçao than in the Netherlands. For Aruba, the 
gap in amenable mortality with the Netherlands did not significantly change 
during the study period, while it widened for Curaçao. If mortality from 
amenable causes were reduced to similar levels as in the Netherlands, men and 
women in Aruba would have added, respectively, 1.19 years and 0.72 years to 
their life expectancies during the period 2005-2007. In Curaçao, this would be 
2.06 years and 2.33 years. The largest cause-specific contributions were found 
for circulatory diseases, breast cancer, perinatal causes, and 
nephritis/nephrosis (these last two causes solely in Curaçao).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in health care services related to circulatory 
diseases, breast cancer, perinatal deaths, and nephritis/nephrosis in the Dutch 
Caribbean could substantially contribute to reducing the gap in life expectancy 
with the Netherlands. Based on our study, we recommend more in-depth studies to 
identify the specific interventions and resources needed to optimize the 
underlying health care areas.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Determinar las áreas específicas de atención de salud cuya 
optimización podría mejorar la salud de la población en las islas del Caribe 
holandés de Aruba y Curaçao.
MÉTODOS: Estudio de observación comparativo en el que se utilizaron datos 
demográficos y de mortalidad de las islas del Caribe holandés y de los Países 
Bajos. Se calcularon las tendencias de mortalidad y luego se analizaron con 
programas de computación Jointpoint de regresión lineal segmentada, para el 
período 1988-2014. La esperanza de vida se calculó utilizando tablas de 
mortalidad abreviadas con los datos más recientes disponibles de todos los 
territorios (2005-2007). Las diferencias de esperanza de vida entre el Caribe 
holandés y los Países Bajos se desglosaron, usando el método de Arriaga, en 
contribuciones por causas específicas.
RESULTADOS: En el período 1988-2014, los niveles de mortalidad por causas 
evitables mediante la atención de salud han sido sistemáticamente mayores en 
Aruba y Curaçao que en los Países Bajos. En el caso de Aruba, la brecha en la 
mortalidad por causas evitables mediante la atención de salud con respecto a los 
Países Bajos no varió significativamente durante el período de estudio; en el 
caso de Curaçao, la brecha fue mayor. Si la mortalidad por causas evitables 
mediante la atención de salud se redujese a un nivel similar al de los Países 
Bajos, los hombres y las mujeres en Aruba habrían sumado, respectivamente, 1,19 
años y 0,72 años a su esperanza de vida en el período 2005-2007. En Curaçao, el 
aumento hubiese sido de 2,06 años y de 2,33 años. Según el estudio, las causas 
específicas que más contribuyen a esta diferencia son las enfermedades 
circulatorias, el cáncer de mama, las complicaciones perinatales, y la 
nefritis/nefrosis (estas últimas dos causas solamente en Curaçao).
CONCLUSIONES: Una mejora en los servicios de salud en relación con las 
enfermedades circulatorias, el cáncer de mama, las complicaciones perinatales, y 
la nefritis/nefrosis en el Caribe holandés podría contribuir sustancialmente a 
la reducción de la brecha en la esperanza de vida con respecto a los Países 
Bajos. Por tanto, con base en nuestro estudio, recomendamos que se realicen más 
estudios exhaustivos a fin de determinar las intervenciones específicas y los 
recursos que se necesitan para optimizar las áreas de atención de salud 
involucradas.

específicas por causa usando o método de Arriaga.
RESULTADOS: No período de 1988 a 2014, os níveis de mortalidade evitável foram 
consistentemente mais elevados em Aruba e Curaçao do que nos Países Baixos. Em 
Aruba, a diferença na mortalidade evitável em comparação com os Países Baixos 
não mudou significativamente durante o período do estudo, enquanto que em 
Curaçao a diferença aumentou. Se a mortalidade por causas evitáveis fosse 
reduzida a níveis semelhantes aos dos Países Baixos, os homens e mulheres de 
Aruba teriam aumentos respectivos de 1,19 e 0,72 anos nas suas expectativas de 
vida durante o período 2005-2007. Em Curaçao, o aumento seria de 2,06 e 2,33 
anos. As maiores contribuições de causas específicas foram as de doenças 
circulatórias, câncer de mama, causas perinatais e nefrite/nefrose (estas duas 
últimas causas somente em Curaçao).
CONCLUSÕES: Melhorias nos serviços de saúde relacionados com doenças 
circulatórias, câncer de mama, mortes perinatais e nefrite/nefrose no Caribe 
holandês poderiam contribuir substancialmente para reduzir as disparidades na 
expectativa de vida em comparação com os Países Baixos. Com base neste trabalho, 
recomendamos estudos mais aprofundados para identificar as intervenções e 
recursos específicos necessários para otimizar estas áreas da atenção à saúde.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, a progressively rising global health problem, 
is also rising in Hemophiliacs due to an increase in life expectancy in them. 
While treating Hemophiliacs with AF, deciding eligibility, choosing the 
anticoagulant based on risk-benefit ratio are tough decisions for physicians to 
make. This review paper aims to explore and compare existing studies, reviews 
and consensus papers to assess the safety of different Novel Oral Anticoagulants 
(NOACS) in this population.
METHODS: Thorough literature search was conducted on Pubmed using Atrial 
Fibrillation, Hemophilia A, Oral anticoagulants, stroke prevention, Dabigatran, 
factor Xa inhibitors as keywords separately and in combinations. Papers in 
English language only from the past 5 years were selected for review. After 
removing duplicate results, 80 papers were selected and after applying different 
exclusion criteria and according to relevance, 40 papers were finalized for 
review.
RESULTS: The keywords AF, Stroke prevention, oral anticoagulants, Hemophilia a, 
Factor Xa inhibitors and Dabigatran gave 24899, 13619, 8964, 3503, 2850, 2799 
results, respectively. Combination keywords also showed some papers and out of 
short-listed 80 relevant papers 35 were finalized. Reviewing and analyzing these 
papers revealed no clinical trials in hemophiliacs with AF in the past 5 years 
and 5 clinical trials comparing NOACs with Warfarin in general population. Rest 
were systematic reviews, consensus papers and meta-analyses on management in 
this group. A few compared these drugs for AF in the general population but not 
specifically in Hemophiliacs and others. consensus papers developed suggestions 
for management and showed that NOACs are superior to Warfarin but need 
individual evaluation in Hemophiliacs with AF.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Hemophilia can also have thrombo-embolism despite 
their bleeding tendency and NOACs are a better option in them because of less 
need for monitoring, no food interactions and fewer drug interactions. This 
comparative review emphasized the need for more work to develop proper 
guidelines for thrombo-prophylaxis management in this specific group.

PURPOSE: The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program 
(NBCCEDP) provides free cervical cancer screening to low-income women. This 
study estimated the health benefits gained in terms of life years (LYs) saved 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained if cervical cancer screening by 
the NBCCEDP increased to reach more eligible women.
METHODS: Data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, NBCCEDP, and 
Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were used. LYs saved and QALYs gained/100,000 
women were estimated using modeling methods. They were used to predict 
additional health benefits gained if screening by the NBCCEDP increased from 
6.5% up to 10-25% of the eligible women.
RESULTS: Overall, per 100,000 women screened by the NBCCEDP, 1,731 LYs were 
saved and 1,608 QALYs were gained. For white women, 1,926 LYs were saved and 
1,780 QALYs were gained/100,000 women screened by the NBCCEDP. For black women, 
1,506 LYs were saved and 1,300 QALYs were gained/100,000 women screened. If the 
proportion of eligible women screened by the NBCCEDP increased to 10-25%, the 
estimated health benefits would range from 6,626-34,896 LYs saved and 
6,153-32,407 QALYs gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported estimates emphasize the value of cervical cancer 
screening program by extending LE in low-income women. Further, it demonstrates 
that screening a higher percentage of eligible women in the NBCCEDP may yield 
more health benefits.

PURPOSE: Whether an unfavorable lifestyle not only affects breast cancer risk, 
but also influences age at onset of breast cancer and survival, is under debate.
METHODS: In a population-based cohort, the Energy Balance and Breast Cancer 
Aspects throughout life (EBBA-Life) study, a total of 17,145 women were 
included. During follow-up, 574 women developed invasive breast cancer. Breast 
cancer cases were followed for an additional 9.1 years. Detailed medical records 
were obtained. Cox's proportional hazard regression models were used to study 
the association between pre-diagnostic lifestyle factors (weight, physical 
activity, alcohol use, smoking, and hypertension), breast cancer risk, age at 
diagnosis, and survival.
RESULTS: At study entry, 34.3% of the participating women were overweight and 
30.7% were physically inactive. Mean age at breast cancer diagnosis was 
58.0 years, and 78.9% of the tumors were estrogen receptor positive. Among 
menopausal women who did not use hormone therapy and had an unfavorable 
lifestyle (3-5 unfavorable factors), compared with women who had a favorable 
lifestyle, we observed a twofold higher risk for postmenopausal breast cancer 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.69), and they were 
3.4 years younger at diagnosis (64.8 versus 68.2 years, P = 0.032). Breast 
cancer patients with an unfavorable lifestyle, compared with patients with a 
favorable lifestyle, had almost a two times higher overall mortality risk 
(HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01-3.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a healthy lifestyle improving breast cancer 
prevention, postponing onset of disease, and extending life expectancy among 
breast cancer patients.

Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Training and Research Hospital, İstanbul-Turkey.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases in humans, surgical procedures applied 
to the elderly people are also increasing in parallel with the developments in 
surgery and postoperative care. A significant number of studies investigating 
the morbidity-mortality of geriatric patients are related to patients who are 
undergoing emergency operations. The present study aims to investigate the 
factors affecting mortality and morbidity after emergency surgery in elderly 
people.
METHODS: The data of 200 patients aged 65 years and over who were operated under 
emergency conditions in the University of Health Sciences Kartal Dr. Lütfi 
Kırdar Training and Research Hospital between January and December 2018 were 
evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: Patient's demographic information, including age, gender, ASA physical 
status, comorbidities, functional dependency or non-dependency of patients, 
types of operation, anesthesia technique, duration of operation, intraoperative 
blood transfusion, the changes of hematocrit levels (during the perioperative 
period), the outcome after surgery (intensive care admission or ward transfer), 
were recorded. The risk prediction of short-term mortality has been estimated 
using CCI and APACHE II scoring systems.
CONCLUSION: The mean age of the patients was 74.8±6.7 and the number of females 
(n=134, 67%) outweighed the males. Higher ASA physical status scores, dependent 
living conditions, long operation time, general anesthesia, intraoperative blood 
transfusion, low Htc values (<25%), high APACHE II scores and lower scores of 
10-years survival by CCI were the factors that affected the acceptance into ICU.

TX, USA.

The advent of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the 
treatment and prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Life expectancy for 
patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia now nears that of the 
healthy population; however, optimal outcomes require continuous tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor administration, which can impact patient quality of life. 
Consequently, the concept of treatment-free remission has been explored in 
patients achieving and sustaining a deep molecular response. Heterogeneous data 
exist with multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, nilotinib is currently 
the only therapy that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
for treatment-free remission. The decision to pursue treatment-free remission is 
one that relies heavily on both patient- and disease-related factors. Herein, we 
will discuss relevant considerations to be made when determining an optimal 
candidate for treatment-free remission.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single point mutation in the β-chain of 
the hemoglobin gene that results in the replacement of glutamic acid with valine 
in the hemoglobin protein. However, recent studies have demonstrated that 
alterations in several other genes, especially immune related genes, may be 
associated with complications of SCD. In fact, higher chronic inflammatory 
status is related to more severe clinical symptoms in SCD patients, suggesting 
crucial roles of the immune system in SCD physiopathology. Nevertheless, 
although participation of innate immune cells in SCD pathogenesis has been 
broadly and extensively described, little is known about the roles of the 
adaptive immune system in this disease. In addition, the influence of treatments 
on the immune system of SCD patients and their complications (such as 
alloimmunization) are not yet completely understood. Thus, we reviewed the 
current knowledge about the immune mechanisms involved in SCD pathogenesis. We 
suggest recommendations for future studies to allow for a broader understanding 
of SCD pathogenesis, helping in the development of new therapies and improvement 
in the life quality and expectancy of patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the cost effectiveness of endoscopy or 
biomarker-based treat to target monitoring of patients with ulcerative colitis 
(UC).
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to identify the most cost effective 
treat to target monitoring strategy for patients with UC staring therapy with 
biologics or small molecule inhibitors. We assessed symptoms (rectal bleeding) 
alone, a combination of symptoms and a biomarker (fecal calprotectin), and 
endoscopy. Transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) estimates were derived from published estimates. The microsimulation 
model tracked an individual patient's disease course and treatment exposures to 
modify downstream treatment effectiveness, probabilities, and disease outcomes. 
The primary analysis included 100,000 individuals over 5 years with a 
willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed with 500 samples and 250 trials, in addition to multiple 
1-, 2-, and 3-way microsimulation sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 32 treatment sequencing algorithms were modeled alongside 3 
disease monitoring strategies within a treat to target approach for UC. 
Combination symptom and biomarker-based monitoring resulted in the highest QALY 
estimate among all the treatment sequencing algorithms. However, monitoring 
disease activity with symptoms alone was the most cost-effective strategy in 86% 
of scenarios, followed by combination symptom and biomarker monitoring in 9%, 
and endoscopy monitoring in 5%. Results were sensitive to treatment costs, 
patient willingness to consider colectomy as a treatment option, and endoscopy 
costs. Endoscopy-based monitoring was favored when treatment costs were high and 
patients were unwilling to undergo colectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination symptom and biomarker-based monitoring resulted in 
the highest QALY estimate. However, symptom-based monitoring is the most 
cost-effective approach to implementing treat to target monitoring for patients 
with UC receiving biologics and small molecule inhibitors.

Intramedullary-Extramedullary Breast Metastasis to the Caudal Neuraxis Two 
Decades after Primary Diagnosis: Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Massachusetts, USA.

BACKGROUND: Intramedullary metastases to the caudal neuraxis with exophytic 
extension to the extramedullary space are rare. We describe the unique case of a 
patient with locally recurrent breast cancer who developed an 
intramedullary-extramedullary metastasis to the conus medullaris and cauda 
equina 22 years after primary diagnosis, the longest interval between primary 
breast cancer and intramedullary spread to date. We also reviewed the published 
literature on focal breast metastases to the conus medullaris or cauda equina.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman with a history of node-positive estrogen 
receptor/progesterone receptor-positive, infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed 
in 1997 and locally recurrent in 2007. Initial treatment included lumpectomy and 
targeted chemoradiation with mastectomy and hormonal therapy at recurrence. 
Twelve years later, she developed 6 weeks of bilateral buttock and leg pain 
without motor or sphincter compromise. Magnetic resonance imaging of the total 
spine revealed a 2 x 1.7 cm bilobed intradural, intramedullary-extramedullary, 
homogenously enhancing, T1-and T2-isointense lesion involving the conus 
medullaris and cauda equina. She underwent subtotal resection of a hormone 
receptor-positive breast metastasis. Her pain improved postoperatively and she 
was stable at 5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that patients who present with symptoms of 
spinal neurologic disease and a history of hormone receptor-positive breast 
cancer require high suspicion for metastatic pathology, despite significant time 
lapse from primary diagnosis. The tumor may involve both the intramedullary and 
extramedullary space, complicating resection. Symptom relief and quality of life 
should guide resection of metastatic lesions to the caudal neuraxis.

Motor hand deficits impact autonomy in everyday life, and neuroplasticity 
processes of motor recovery can be explored using functional MRI (fMRI). 
However, few studies have used fMRI to explore the mechanisms underlying hand 
recovery following stroke. Based on the dual visuomotor model positing that two 
segregated dorsomedial and dorsolateral cerebral networks control reach and 
grasp movements, we explored the relationship between motor task-related 
activity in the sensorimotor network and hand recovery following stroke. 
Behavioral recovery was explored with a handgrip force task assessing simple 
grasp, and a visuomotor reaching and precise grasping task, the Purdue Pegboard 
Test (PPT). We used a passive wrist flexion-extension task to measure fMRI 
activity in 36 sensorimotor brain areas. Behavioral and fMRI measurements were 
performed in 27 patients (53.2 ± 9.5 years) 1-month following stroke, and then 
6-month and 24-month later. The effects of sensorimotor activity on hand 
recovery were analyzed using correlations and linear mixed models (LMMs). PPT 
and handgrip force correlated with fMRI activity measures in the sensorimotor 
and parietal areas. PPT recovery was modeled by fMRI measures in the 
ipsilesional primary motor cortex (MI-4p), superior parietal lobule (SPL-7M) and 
parietal operculum OP1, and lesion side. Handgrip force was modeled by 
ipsilesional MI-4a, OP1, and contralesional inferior parietal lobule (IPL-PFt). 
Moreover, the relationship between fMRI activity and hand recovery was 
time-dependent, occurring in the early recovery period in SPL-BA-7M, and later 
in MI. These results suggest that areas of both dorsolateral and dorsomedial 
networks participate to visuomotor reach and grasp tasks (PPT), while 
dorsolateral network areas may control recovery of simple grasp (handgrip 
force), suggesting that the type of movement modulates network recruitment. We 
also found functional dissociations between MI-4p related to PPT that required 
independent finger movements and MI-4a related to simple grasp without 
independent finger movements. These findings need to be replicated in further 
studies.

BACKGROUND: There has been an increased focus on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) 
within the animal health domain (World Health Organization, 2015; O'Neill, 
2016). Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance AMS is 
essential to support the development of this practice. This scoping review 
summarises for the first time the extent, range, and nature of global research 
activity on approaches for improving AMS in farmers and veterinarians involved 
in livestock farm animal management, health & well-being.
METHODS: In November 2017 AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, MEDLINE, VetsRev and 
the Web of Science were searched. Studies were selected by two reviewers with 30 
% of excluded and all included studies being independently reviewed by another 
reviewer. Inclusion criteria were primary studies or literature reviews focusing 
on antimicrobial use (AMU) in farming or veterinary practices for food-producing 
animals. Outcomes were changes in, or factors influencing farmers' or 
veterinarians' AMS. Exclusion criteria were studies on wild or companion animals 
or reports of the level of, rather influencing factors for AMS, or 
knowledge/awareness related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Study 
characteristics and relevant outcomes were extracted, identified facilitators 
and barriers grouped into categories, and a narrative synthesis was conducted. 
The PRISMA checklist extension for scoping reviews was used to guide the 
reporting of the review.
RESULTS: 52 studies were included in the review; seven were intervention studies 
and 45 were studies of facilitators and barriers of AMU or antimicrobial 
prescribing (AMP). Studies were predominantly from high-income countries with 
only seven studies from low- or middle-income countries. Evidence for effective 
interventions was limited in terms of number of studies and robustness of 
evidence. There was some effect for an educational intervention in European 
cattle farmers and the Yellow Card scheme for Danish pig farmers. Significant 
facilitators to veterinarians' prudent AMP, in the cattle and pig livestock 
sector, included education, veterinarians' positive attitudes towards AMU 
reduction, and diagnostic. For farmers, significant facilitators to reduction of 
AMU were most frequently related to farming management practices.
CONCLUSION: This review describes a scarcity of robust study designs and 
recommendations can be confidently made for better designed studies. 
Furthermore, greater consideration needs to be given to the outcome measures 
used in such studies. Nevertheless, the review summarises the evidence on the 
effectiveness of interventions and significant facilitators to farmers' and 
veterinarians' AMS, which can provide best currently available evidence to guide 
improvements in different livestock sectors.
