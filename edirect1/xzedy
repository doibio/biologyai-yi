convergence hypothesis on infant mortality rate, under-five mortality, and life 
expectancy at birth. Then, we use the marginal effects of the ordered logit 
regression model to investigate the factors that explain club memberships.
RESULTS: The findings showed the absence of overall convergence for the three 
variables of interest. However, we identified the presence of convergence clubs. 
Moreover, we observed substantial gaps between the estimated clubs. The marginal 
effect results reveal that real GDP per capita, population structure, 
urbanization, trade, access to basic sanitation, and external health expenditure 
are essential to club formation. In addition, DTP immunization and the general 
government health expenditure as a percentage of the general government 
expenditure (our Abuja Declaration instrument) also play a significant role in 
explaining the club membership.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that policymakers should develop and implement 
targeted club-specific health policies. Furthermore, interventions to promote 
increased immunization, particularly among children, should be encouraged. 
Governments should also make substantial efforts to increase the share of their 
national budget allocated to the health sector by at least 15 percent.

Mechanical behaviors of a polymer gel are coupled with its swelling behavior. It 
has been known that typical hydrogels display extension-induced swelling and 
drying-induced stiffening, called normal mechanical-swelling coupling. In this 
study, we experimentally found that highly extended double-network (DN) 
hydrogels exhibit abnormal inverse mechanical-swelling coupling such as 
extension-induced deswelling and drying-induced softening. We established 
theoretical hyperelastic and swelling models that reproduced all the complicated 
mechanical and swelling trends of the highly deformed DN hydrogels. From these 
theoretical analyses, it is considered that the inverse mechanical-swelling 
coupling of a DN gel is derived from the extreme nonlinear elasticity of its 
first network at its ultimate deformation state. These findings contribute 
toward the understanding of the mechanics of rubber-like materials up to their 
ultimate deformation and fracture limit.

OBJECTIVES: Although there is well-established evidence for the existence of 
socio-economic inequalities in virtually all dimensions of health, little is 
known about the implications of these socio-economic disparities for healthcare 
costs from a cumulative life course perspective. Accounting for differentials in 
healthcare use patterns and mortality, we assess how lifetime costs differ 
between socio-economic groups.
STUDY DESIGN: This study used dynamic microsimulation modelling.
METHODS: Combining price weights for healthcare services with information on 
healthcare consumption from the 2014 Austrian Health Interview Survey 
(n = 15,771), we calculated average cost profiles by gender, age and education 
consistent with aggregate System of Health Accounts. A dynamic microsimulation 
model was used to project cumulative healthcare costs over the entire lifecycle 
for the 2019 birth cohort in four different scenarios to illustrate the 
influence of the different cost determinants on lifetime costs.
RESULTS: Before considering social inequalities in mortality, men with 
compulsory education have close to 66% higher lifetime costs than men with 
tertiary education; for women, the difference is close to 20%. Accounting for 
longevity differentials reduces this gap to approximately 40% for men and 10% 
for women. Closing the gap in healthcare use and in longevity between 
socio-economic groups would reduce lifetime healthcare expenditure by 4.1% in 
the 2019 birth cohort and by 19% in the whole population.
CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for mortality differentials between socio-economic 
groups has a large impact on estimated lifetime healthcare costs. Reducing 
social inequalities in health can contribute to containing healthcare 
expenditures against the backdrop of rising life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) can have various unusual 
presentations. We report an unusual presentation of RMS as orbital apex syndrome 
in a six-year-old boy involving the petrous part of the temporal bone.
CASE PRESENTATION: A six-year-old boy presented with drooping of the left eyelid 
for seven days associated with headache, left-sided hearing loss, and nasal 
blockage. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) brain and orbit 
revealed an ill-defined expansile vascular lesion centered at the petrous part 
of the left temporal bone with extension to the cavernous sinus, which was 
confirmed as RMS on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The patient was 
managed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: RMS is the most common aggressive malignant soft tissue 
tumor in the pediatric population. It accounts for 4-8 % of all malignancies in 
children below 15 years of age, with strong male preponderance. The most common 
site for RMS is head and neck (45 %), having maximum incidence during the first 
decade of life.
CONCLUSION: Total external ophthalmoplegia in a child is an acute emergency; it 
should be properly worked up, and neuroimaging should always be advised. Prompt 
diagnosis and management by a multidisciplinary team can be both life and 
sight-saving.

We estimate the life expectancy gaps that can be bridged by improving the 
quality of public health and health care policies at the country level. Our 
model calculates the net effect of amenable deaths on life expectancy after 
controlling for time effects and factors affecting amenable deaths related to 
education, health policies (health expenditure to GDP and waiting lists), and 
per capita income in a two equation system. We further estimate the life 
expectancy gap that countries with lower quality health systems can bridge by 
catching up and reaching the existing health quality frontier and compute the 
social value of that upside potential.

BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) accounts for a large fraction 
of the burden of depression. The interventions currently used are mostly 
pharmacological and short-term psychotherapies, but their effectiveness is 
limited. The Tavistock Adult Depression Study found evidence for the 
effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP) plus treatment as 
usual (TAU), versus TAU alone, for TRD. Even after a 2-year follow-up, moderate 
effect sizes were sustained. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of this 
LTPP + TAU.
METHODS: We conducted a within-trial economic evaluation using a Bayesian 
framework.
RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.16 higher in the LTPP + TAU 
group compared with TAU. The direct cost of LTPP was £5500, with no substantial 
compensating savings elsewhere. Overall, average health and social care costs in 
the LTPP + TAU group were £5000 more than in the TAU group, employment rates 
were unchanged, and effects on other non-healthcare costs were uncertain. 
Accordingly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ≈£33,000/QALY; the 
probability that LTPP + TAU was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 
£20,000/QALY was 18 %.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size of this study was relatively small, and the 
fraction of missing service-use data was approximately 50 % at all time points. 
The study was conducted at a single site, potentially reducing generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: Although LTPP + TAU was found to be clinically effective for 
treating TRD, it was not found to be cost-effective compared with TAU. However, 
given the sustained effects over the follow-up period it is likely that the time 
horizon of this study was too short to capture all benefits of LTPP 
augmentation.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution is the sixth highest risk factor for attributable 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in North Africa and the Middle East, but 
the relative importance of different subtypes of air pollution and any potential 
differences in their health effects by population demographics or country-level 
socioeconomic factors have not been fully explored. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the effect of high ambient particulate matter less than 2·5 
μm in size (PM) and ambient ozone air pollution on disease burden, mortality, 
and life expectancy in 21 countries in the North Africa and the Middle East 
super-region from 1990 to 2019 using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors (GBD) Study estimates.
METHODS: The study data were derived from GBD 2019, examining data from 1999 to 
2019 in North Africa and the Middle East. In this study, the types of air 
pollution investigated included PM pollution and ambient ozone pollution. PM 
pollution itself was categorised as household air pollution from solid fuels and 
ambient PM pollution. The burden attributable to each risk factor, directly or 
indirectly, was incorporated in the population attributable fraction to estimate 
the total attributable deaths and DALYs. The summary exposure value (SEV) as the 
relative risk-weighted prevalence of exposure was extracted to compare the 
distribution of excess risk times the exposure level in a population where 
everyone is at maximum risk and ranges from zero (no excess risk exists in a 
population) to 100 (highest risk). The effect of air pollution on life 
expectancy was estimated via a cause-deleted life table analysis.
FINDINGS: The age-standardised DALYs rate attributable to air pollution declined 
by 44·5%, from 4884·2 (95% uncertainty interval 4381·5-5555·4) to 2710·4 
(2317·3-3125·6) per 100 000 from 1990 to 2019. Afghanistan (6992·3, 
5627·7-8482·7), Yemen (4212·4, 3241·3-5418·1), and Egypt (4034·8, 3027·7-5138·6) 
had the highest age-standardised DALYs rates attributable to air pollution in 
2019 per 100 000, whereas Türkiye (1329·2, 1033·7-1654·7), Jordan (1447·3, 
1154·2-1758·5), and Iran (1603·0, 1404·7-1813·8) had the lowest rates. During 
the study period, the age-standardised SEV of air pollution (PM and ambient 
ozone in total) decreased by 10·9% (5·8-17·7%) in the super-region, whereas the 
SEV of ambient ozone pollution alone increased by 7·7% (0·7-14·3%). Among the 
components of PM pollution, the SEV of ambient PM pollution increased by 40·1% 
(25·2-63·7%); however, the SEV of household air pollution from solid fuels 
decreased by 70·6% (64·1-77·0%). Among the investigated types of air pollution, 
98·9% of the DALYs from air pollution in the super-region were attributable to 
PM pollution. If air pollution had been lowered to the theoretical minimum risk 
exposure levels for 2019, then the average life expectancy would have been 1·6 
years higher.
INTERPRETATION: The burden attributable to air pollution substantially decreased 
in the study period across the super-region as a whole. Most of the burden from 
air pollution is attributed to PM pollution, the exposure to which has 
substantially increased in the past three decades. Interventions and policies 
that reduce population exposure to PM pollution could potentially increase the 
average life expectancy in the super-region. This finding calls for concerted 
efforts from governments and public health authorities in the super-region to 
tackle air pollution as an important threat to population health.

Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.

PURPOSE: This scoping review aimed to systematically map research regarding 
implant-assisted removable partial dentures (IARPDs), and identify existing gaps 
in knowledge.
STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently conducted a search of the 
MEDLINE-PubMed and Scopus databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Review 
and included articles published in English up to August 31, 2022, including 
human studies, reviews, and in vitro studies. Expert opinions, animal studies, 
and clinical studies involving complete overdentures were excluded, and ten 
aspects for establishing the treatment strategy for IARPDs were examined.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve articles were chosen. There were two treatment 
modalities: IARPDs retained by implant- and tooth-supported surveyed single 
crowns (SCs) or fixed partial dentures (FPDs). In IARPDs retained by 
tooth-supported surveyed SCs or FPDs, the survival rate of dental implants for 
IARPDs was relatively higher with a wide range of marginal bone loss and many 
complications, but with improved functional performance, oral health-related 
quality of life, and patient satisfaction. There were limited data on survival 
or success rates and designs of IARPDs, attachment selections, length and 
diameter, inclination, placement sites, and loading protocols of implants, 
regardless of prosthetic types. There was limited information on maxillary 
IARPDs except for survival rates of implants.
CONCLUSIONS: Although IARPDs could become a useful treatment strategy, there is 
limited scientific consensus with gaps in knowledge about their use. Additional 
well-designed clinical and in vitro studies are necessary to scientifically 
establish IARPDs as definitive prostheses in implant dentistry.

INTRODUCTION: New approaches are being developed to early detect endometrial 
cancer using molecular biomarkers. These approaches offer high sensitivities and 
specificities, representing a promising horizon to develop early detection 
strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing 
molecular testing to detect endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal 
bleeding compared to the current strategy using the national healthcare service 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the two early detection 
strategies. The model predicts the number of hysterectomies, lifetime 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years, endometrial cancer prevalence and 
incidence, mortality from endometrial cancer and the lifetime cost of screening, 
diagnosis, and treatment. Strategies were compared using the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The molecular strategy reduces 1.9% of the overall number of 
hysterectomies and the number of undetected cancer cases by 65%. Assuming a 
molecular test cost of 310€, the molecular strategy has an incremental cost of 
-32,952€ per QALY gained, being more effective and less expensive than the 
current strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of molecular testing to diagnose endometrial 
cancer in women presenting postmenopausal bleeding provides more health benefit 
at a lower cost, and therefore has the potential to be cost-effective.

Cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), are a great health concern. The strategies aimed 
to increase awareness and prevention, in conjunction with timely diagnosis and 
optimal management of these conditions, represent the main lines of action to 
improve life expectancy and quality. In recent years, the introduction of 
innovative therapies for the treatment of DM and CVD has provided new hope for 
high-risk patients. Yet, the implementation of preventive measures in achieving 
cardiometabolic health is far from successful and requires further improvement. 
The development of cardiometabolic disorders is a complex, multifactorial 
process involving several metabolic pathways as well as genetic and 
environmental factors. Decreasing cumulative exposure during the entire life 
course and timely recognition and targeting of potential riskenhancing factors 
could pave the way toward more successful prevention of cardiometabolic 
disorders. Nowadays, in the era of "omics" technologies, it is possible to 
identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, which offers the possibility 
to apply an individualized approach for each patient. This review will discuss 
potential applications of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolomic 
biomarkers for the personalized prevention of cardiometabolic diseases.

International research on healthy life expectancy (HALE) focuses on inequality 
of socioeconomic status and individual natural attributes. With the acceleration 
of population ageing and the increase in average life expectancy, the extension 
of unhealthy life expectancy and the increase of social and economic burden 
caused by diseases have gradually attracted the attention of countries around 
the world. Therefore, the evaluation of disease factors affecting HALE is a 
meaningful direction in the future. This study introduces the development 
process and commonly used measurement methods of HALE. According to the 
definition of health from the Global Burden of Disease Study and World Health 
Organization, physical and mental diseases such as cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, malignant 
tumors and depression were selected to summarize the impact of these diseases 
and pre-disease states on HALE. It is expected to provide a theoretical basis 
for the formulation of relevant public health policies and the improvement of 
quality of life in China.

Objective: The direction and intensity of population aging on the burden of 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in China from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed, and 
the burden of NCDs in 2050 was predicted. Methods: The disease-specific 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years 
lived with disability (YLDs) in the Chinese population from 1990 to 2019 were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study.The differences in indicators 
from 1990 to 2019 were attributed to the contribution of age structure, 
population size, and all other causes. The Bayesian age-time-cohort models were 
used to predict DALYs from NCDs to 2050. Results: The absolute level of DALYs 
caused by NCDs increased by 7.460 million from 1990 to 2019, and the age 
structure contributed 186.0% (95% Uncertainty Intervals (UIs): 178.4%-193.6%), 
population size contributed 77.0% (95% UIs: 69.5%-80.8%), all other causes 
contributed -163.0% (95% UIs:-163.1%- -159.3%). DALYs caused by NCDs consist of 
2.527 million YLLs and 4.934 million YLDs, in which the contribution of age 
structure to YLLs and YLDs was 414.6% (95% UIs: 396.2%-432.5%) and 69.1% (95% 
UIs: 66.7%-71.4%), respectively. From 2019 to 2050, the diseases with increased 
DALYs due to changes in age structure are cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, 
chronic respiratory diseases, neurological disorders, sense organ diseases, 
diabetes and kidney diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, digestive diseases, 
mental disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases in descending order. 
Conclusions: From 1990 to 2019, except for skin and subcutaneous diseases, the 
burden of other NCDs attributable to population aging increased, mainly due to 
disability. By 2050, the burden of NCDsattributable to population aging will 
continue to rise.

分析1990—2019年中国人口老龄化对慢性非传染性疾病（慢病）负担的作用方向和强度，并预测2050年人口老龄化可能产生的慢病负担。 方法： 
基于全球疾病负担研究数据，将1990—2019年中国人群疾病别伤残调整寿命年（DALYs）、早死损失寿命年（YLLs）、伤残损失寿命年（YLDs）的差距归因于人口年龄结构、人口规模和所有其他原因的贡献，使用贝叶斯年龄-时期-队列模型预测至2050年慢病产生的DALYs。 
结果： 
中国慢病导致的DALYs在1990—2019年期间增加了746.0万人年，其中年龄结构的贡献为186.0%（95%UIs：178.4%~193.6%），人口规模为77.0%（95%UIs：69.5%~80.8%），其他所有原因为-163.0%（95%UIs：-163.1%~-159.3%）。DALYs由252.7万人年的YLLs和493.4万人年的YLDs构成，其中年龄结构对YLLs和YLDs的贡献分别为414.6%（95%UIs：396.2%~432.5%）、69.1%（95%UIs：66.7%~71.4%）。2019—2050年期间，年龄结构变化使DALYs增加的慢病由高到低依次为：心血管疾病、肿瘤、慢性呼吸道疾病、神经失调、感觉器官疾病、糖尿病和肾脏病、肌肉骨骼疾病、消化道疾病、精神障碍、皮肤和皮下疾病。 
结论： 
1990—2019年，除皮肤和皮下疾病外，其他类别慢病的归因负担均有上升，且以归因伤残负担为主。至2050年，多数慢病归因于人口老龄化的慢病负担可能持续升高。.

The ACL is the primary stabilizer of the knee joint. The injury leads to 
instability of the knee joint, which is a trigger for the subsequent destructive 
changes of the intra-articular structures such as menisci and cartilage of the 
joint surfaces. The most affected group is people of an active age, engaged in 
amateur sports. Also, this pathology is an occupational hazard in the military. 
In this community, ACL injuries have reached 3.24% in men and 3.51% in women, 
with increasing trends, especially among women. This data is derived from a 
study by Keller Army Hospital, West Point, New York. In this study we selected 2 
groups of patients - operated with autograft and operated with allograft. The 
groups included 25 patients followed for a period of 18 months. The tissues used 
for ACL reconstruction were: 1) for allograft - BTB donor tissue / allograft / 
2) for autologous transplantation - mm. Semitendinosus et Gracillis / autograft 
/. After the operation, the patients are placed in a rehabilitation program in 
five interconnected phases. The way they are performed allows the principle of 
gradual loading and constant feedback between the patient and the 
physiotherapist to be observed. Each of the phases has specific goals in the 
rehabilitation cycle, which has a certain approximate duration. After completion 
of the rehabilitation process, the clinical outcomes of both groups were 
compared using the International Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and 
three in-house diagnostic methods. Our own diagnostic methods are Power test (a 
strength simulator is used, which directly examines the strength of the limb in 
flexion and extension in real life test. The results from IKDC were in favor of 
the autograft group (92.82) and from Lischolm of the allograft group (92.24). In 
terms of the power test the results were in favor of the allograft group. The 
result from the Power 1 test clearly shows statistically significant difference 
in symmetry of power in flexion and extension which is better in the allograft 
group compared to the autograft group. In our research we did not come across 
such a test in other studies. In conclusion we proved that the development of a 
single strict rehabilitation protocol focusing on the principle of gradual 
increase in workloads achieves comparable results in the frequency of re-rupture 
in both the allograft and auto-graft groups.

The review considers the principles of treatment of various forms of alcoholic 
liver disease from the point of view of the evidence base and clinical 
recommendations. The main therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis is systemic 
glucocorticosteroids, their effect on survival is increased by the addition of 
antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, ademethionine). The effect of ademetionine on 
the life expectancy of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of Child-Pugh class A 
and B has been proven. The treatment of patients with mild forms of alcoholic 
liver disease is not well developed, and the evidence base for most of the drugs 
used is modest.

Publisher: В обзоре рассмотрены принципы лечения различных форм алкогольной 
болезни печени с точки зрения доказательной базы и клинических рекомендаций. 
Основной терапией тяжелого алкогольного гепатита являются системные 
глюкокортикостероиды. Их влияние на выживаемость увеличивается при добавлении 
антиоксидантов (N-ацетилцистеина, адеметионина). Доказано влияние адеметионина 
на продолжительность жизни пациентов с алкогольным циррозом классов А и В по 
Чайлд–Пью. Лечение легких форм алкогольной болезни печени недостаточно 
разработано, доказательная база у большинства используемых препаратов скромна.

Canine and feline endocrinopathies reflect an endocrine gland disease or 
dysfunction with resulting hormonal abnormali ties that can variably affect the 
patient's wellbeing, quality of life, and life expectancy. These guidelines 
provide consensus recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of four canine and 
feline endocrinopathies commonly encountered in clini cal practice: canine 
hypothyroidism, canine hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome), canine 
hypoadrenocorticism (Addi son's disease), and feline hyperthyroidism. To aid the 
general practitioner in navigating these common diseases, a stepwise diagnosis 
and treatment algorithm and relevant background information is provided for 
managing each of these diseases. The guidelines also describe, in lesser detail, 
the diagnosis and treatment of three relatively less common endo crinopathies of 
cats: feline hyperaldosteronism, feline hypothyroidism, and feline 
hyperadrenocorticism. Additionally, the guidelines present tips on effective 
veterinary team utilization and client communication when discussing endocrine 
cases.

White melon (Cucumeropsis mannii Naudin), is among common and yet underutilized 
oil seed crop within the West African region, does not have sufficient 
information specific to its nutrient composition for foreign consumers. To 
supplement existing information, therefore, we investigated the nutritional 
profile of defatted and full-fat flour, alongside physicochemical breakdown and 
storage performance of soxhlet-extracted oil from two white melon (C. mannii) 
seed varieties found in Southeast Nigeria. Nutritional profile involved the 
determinations of proximate composition, minerals, vitamins, functional 
properties as well as amino acid profile. Physicochemical breakdown involved the 
determinations of fatty acid profile, lipid breakdown parameters, as well as 
associated physical attributes. Results showed defatting of flours increased the 
protein (69.04%), carbohydrates (16.26%), crude fiber (2.68%), ash (11.9%), 
mineral (Na ranging from 223.92-246.99 mg/100g), and vitamin contents (Vit B1 
ranging from 0.453-0.712 mg/100g). Total amino acid differed slightly when 
comparing miniature (30.36 g/100g) and large (22.36 g/100g) seeds. 
Soxhlet-extracted oil possessed low thiobarbituric acid, acid, and peroxide 
values (0.030 and 0.038 mg MDA/kg, 1.08 and 1.27 mg KOH/g, and 2.95 and 3,94 
mEqO2/kg, for large and miniature seeds respectively), and peak linoleic acid (5 
and 6.45 mg/ml, for miniature and large seeds respectively). During storage, the 
thiobarbituric acid and peroxide values of soxhlet-extracted oil increased yet 
within acceptable limits.

Renin-Angiotensin System and Sex Differences in COVID-19: A Critical Assessment.

Chappell MC(1).

Author information:

Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC.

The current epidemic of corona virus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in an 
immense health burden that became the third leading cause of death and 
potentially contributed to a decline in life expectancy in the United States. 
The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 binds to the 
surface-bound peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, EC 3.4.17.23) 
leading to tissue infection and viral replication. ACE2 is an important 
enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) expressed in the lung 
and other organs. The peptidase regulates the levels of the peptide hormones Ang 
II and Ang-(1-7), which have distinct and opposing actions to one another, as 
well as other cardiovascular peptides. A potential consequence of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 infection is reduced ACE2 activity by 
internalization of the viral-ACE2 complex and subsequent activation of the RAS 
(higher ratio of Ang II:Ang-[1-7]) that may exacerbate the acute inflammatory 
events in COVID-19 patients and possibly contribute to the effects of long 
COVID-19. Moreover, COVID-19 patients present with an array of autoantibodies to 
various components of the RAS including the peptide Ang II, the enzyme ACE2, and 
the AT1 AT2 and Mas receptors. Greater disease severity is also evident in male 
COVID-19 patients, which may reflect underlying sex differences in the 
regulation of the 2 distinct functional arms of the RAS. The current review 
provides a critical evaluation of the evidence for an activated RAS in COVID-19 
subjects and whether this system contributes to the greater severity of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 infection in males as compared 
with females.

PURPOSE: To compare the computability of Observational Medical Outcomes 
Partnership (OMOP)-based queries related to prescreening of patients using two 
versions of the OMOP common data model (CDM; v5.3 and v5.4) and to assess the 
performance of the Greater Paris University Hospital (APHP) prescreening tool.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified the prescreening information items being 
relevant for prescreening of patients with cancer. We randomly selected 15 
academic and industry-sponsored urology phase I-IV clinical trials (CTs) 
launched at APHP between 2016 and 2021. The computability of the related 
prescreening criteria (PC) was defined by their translation rate in 
OMOP-compliant queries and by their execution rate on the APHP clinical data 
warehouse (CDW) containing data of 205,977 patients with cancer. The overall 
performance of the prescreening tool was assessed by the rate of true- and 
false-positive cases of three randomly selected CTs.
RESULTS: We defined a list of 15 minimal information items being relevant for 
patients' prescreening. We identified 83 PC of the 534 eligibility criteria from 
the 15 CTs. We translated 33 and 62 PC in queries on the basis of OMOP CDM v5.3 
and v5.4, respectively (translation rates of 40% and 75%, respectively). Of the 
33 PC translated in the v5.3 of the OMOP CDM, 19 could be executed on the APHP 
CDW (execution rate of 58%). Of 83 PC, the computability rate on the APHP CDW 
reached 23%. On the basis of three CTs, we identified 17, 32, and 63 patients as 
being potentially eligible for inclusion in those CTs, resulting in positive 
predictive values of 53%, 41%, and 21%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We showed that PC could be formalized according to the OMOP CDM and 
that the oncology extension increased their translation rate through better 
representation of cancer natural history.

This study provides an important extension to the growing literature on 
prospection in children by providing the first test of whether one's ability to 
engage in the functional (as opposed to the purely phenomenological) aspect of 
episodic foresight improves across middle childhood. Of the various forms of 
prospection, episodic foresight has been proposed to be one of the most flexible 
and functionally powerful, defined as the ability to not only imagine future 
events (simulative aspect) but also use those imaginings to guide behavior in 
the present (functional aspect). The current study tested 80 typically 
developing children aged 8 to 12 years using an extensive cognitive battery 
comprising Virtual Week Foresight, the Autobiographical Interview, and a series 
of crystallized and fluid intelligence measures. Whereas data indicated 
age-related improvements in detecting future-oriented problems and taking steps 
in the present in service of solving these, all children in this age bracket 
demonstrated a similar capacity for problem resolution (i.e., the ability to 
subsequently solve successfully identified problems). Results also revealed the 
importance of broader crystallized and fluid intelligence, but not episodic 
memory or episodic future thinking, in engaging in this capacity. Research is 
now required to understand the real-life consequences of episodic foresight 
during this developmental period as well as the ways in which parents and 
teachers can help to foster this capacity and consequently help to support
