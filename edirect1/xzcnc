type of cancer based on ICD-10. The number of years lost were obtained according 
to life expectancy in Mexico (72 years for men and 77 years for women).
RESULTS: Prostate cancer mortality is higher than that of breast cancer, but 
lost years in women due to breast cancer are higher. The cost of programs for 
breast and prostate cancer from 2013 to 2016 in both institutions was 3 036 322 
156 Mexican Pesos.
CONCLUSION: Institutional programs have not had an impact to the benefit of the 
population in spite of their cost and prostate cancer has not been correctly 
evaluated. It is necessary for strategies to be assessed and redesigned in order 
to optimize expenditure and benefit the population.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: En México se realizan fuertes erogaciones en recursos 
para la detección oportuna del cáncer cervicouterino y mamario, pero la 
Secretaría de Salud y el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social no cuentan con un 
programa para la detección de cáncer prostático.
OBJETIVOS: Comparar la mortalidad por cáncer mamario, cervicouterino y 
prostático en México, así como de los años perdidos de 2013 a 2016, contra los 
costos de los programas.
MÉTODO: De la mortalidad general por residencia se tomaron las defunciones por 
cada tipo de cáncer con base en la CIE-10; los años perdidos fueron obtenidos 
conforme la esperanza de vida de México: 72 y 77 años para hombres y mujeres.
RESULTADOS: La mortalidad por cáncer prostático fue mayor a la de cáncer 
mamario, pero los años perdidos en mujeres por cáncer mamario fue mayor. El 
costo de los programas para cáncer mamario y prostático de las dos instituciones 
de 2013 a 2016 fue de $3 036 322 156 m.n.
CONCLUSIÓN: Los programas de las instituciones no han impactado en beneficio de 
la población a pesar de su costo y no se ha dimensionado correctamente el cáncer 
prostático. Es necesario evaluar y rediseñar estrategias que optimicen el gasto 
y beneficien a la población.

With the rapid increase in the population of the oldest old (those aged 80 and 
over), there is some concern how longer life might be associated with a loss of 
independence in daily living. Addressing the trajectory of loss of independence 
for the oldest old is challenging, not only because the oldest old are 
heterogeneous, but also because the health trajectories at the population level 
may noticeably differ from those at the individual level. We used the 1998, 
2000, 2002, 2005 and 2008 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity 
Study to assess the age trajectories of the loss of independence for three 
cohorts born in 1909-1918, 1899-1908 and 1893-1898, respectively, both at the 
individual and the population levels. Independence was measured by combining the 
activities of daily living and the Chinese version of the mini-mental state 
examination. Controlling for various confounding factors, particularly the 
selectivity due to death and loss to follow-up, we found that, while more recent 
cohorts had higher initial levels of independence, this was followed by a faster 
decline compared to the earlier cohorts. Also, their level of independence fell 
below that of their earlier born counterparts at the same ages. Decomposition 
analysis further illustrated that the decline of independence at the population 
level is more gradual than that at the individual level. This finding can be 
largely attributed to selective mortality and loss to follow-up. For instance, 
the population prevalence of independence for the 1893-1898 female cohort 
declined slightly, from 19.7 to 11.1% in 1998-2008, while the proportion for 
females who survived from 1998 to 2008 dropped from 66.7 to 11.1%. For the 
population as a whole, a longer life expectancy does not necessarily result in a 
rapid decline of independence. For individuals, longer life expectancy 
accompanies deterioration of independence.

The spine is one of the most common sites to which metastatic cancer is likely 
to spread and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer 
patients. While no medical treatments have been definitively shown to extend the 
life expectancy of patients with spinal metastasis, interventional options may 
be the only viable option in improving outcomes. Currently, two main options 
exist: surgical resection and radiotherapy, with radiotherapy being the primary 
treatment modality. In this review, we discuss the research comparing the 
efficacy and outcomes of radiotherapy and surgical resection in treating spinal 
metastasis. We conclude that while radiosurgery will continue to remain a major 
treatment modality, surgical intervention has proven to have equal to or 
superior outcomes at improving function, symptoms, and life expectancy for 
patients with metastatic spinal disease and should be considered a primary 
modality in an expanding subset of patients.

A 64-year-old woman with recurrent mitral valve stenosis was hospitalized 30 
years after open commissurotomy. Severe right cerebral embolism occurred at age 
58, with left hemiparesis. She was debilitated with cardiac cachexia. Based on 
symptomatic valvular disease findings, surgery was considered, but deemed too 
high risk due to the combined insufficiencies. She refused this surgical 
operation and requested conservative therapy. Optimized medication and cardiac 
rehabilitation improved her general condition allowing transfer to another 
hospital. We explained the short life expectancy both to her and to her family. 
They decided to transfer to a hospice at a chronic care hospital and she was 
given best supportive care. Eventually, her urine output decreased and 
respiration deteriorated. She and her family refused resuscitation in the event 
of cardiopulmonary arrest, requesting only suffering reduction. Thus, continuous 
intravenous infusion of morphine was started. The optimized doses for pain 
alleviation were determined in consultation with palliative care specialists and 
maximized her consciousness level for the last four days. "Heart-failure 
hospice" is potentially a place to die for end-of-life patients, attended by 
their families and healthcare providers. They need prognostic information and 
options for end-stage. Our experience confirms results about palliative care 
from previous studies conducted overseas demonstrating the effectiveness of 
opioids relieving end-stage symptoms. <Learning objective: Perform an 
appropriate end-of-life assessment for patients with irreversible severe heart 
failure. Formulate appropriate plans for further evaluation and management, 
including referral and consultation to palliative care specialists when 
necessary. Develop an appropriate regional cooperation, with consideration given 
to the less common optional treatment for cardiac dysfunction, "heart-failure 
hospice.">.

To understand the molecular features underlying stem cell aging, we established 
intestinal epithelial organoids derived from both young and aged mice and 
investigated alterations in their senescence and epigenetic status. 
Senescence-related changes including accumulation of senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase and up-regulation of Cdkn1a (p21) by DNA demethylation were 
observed in intestinal epithelial organoids derived from aged mice. We also 
demonstrated that the important stem cell marker Lgr5 was epigenetically 
silenced by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27, inducing suppression of Wnt 
signaling and a decrease of cell proliferation in organoids from aged mice. We 
further treated intestinal epithelial organoids from aged mice with nicotinamide 
mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ intermediate. As a result, the organoids showed 
a higher NAD+ level, increased cell proliferative ability, activation of Lgr5 
and suppression of senescence-associated genes, indicating that treatment with 
NMN could ameliorate senescence-related changes in intestinal epithelia. These 
findings suggest that organoids derived from aged animals could be a powerful 
research tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell 
aging and for development of some form of anti-aging intervention, thus 
contributing to prolongation of healthy life expectancy.

Multi-disciplinary and shared decision-making approach in the management of 
organ-confined prostate cancer.

Decision-making in the management of organ-confined prostate cancer is complex 
as it is based on multi-factorial considerations. It is complicated by a 
multitude of issues, which are related to the patient, treatment, disease, 
availability of equipment(s), expertise, and physicians. Combination of all 
these factors play a major role in the decision-making process and provide for 
an interactive decision-making preferably in the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) 
meeting. MDT decisions are comprehensive and are often based on all factors 
including patients' biological status, disease and its aggressiveness, and 
physician and centres' expertise. However, one important and often under rated 
factor is patient-related factors. There is considerable evidence that patients 
and physicians have different goals for treatment and physicians' understanding 
of their own patients' preferences is not accurate. Several patient-related key 
factors have been identified such as age, religious beliefs, sexual health, 
educational background, and cognitive impairment. We have focused on these areas 
and highlight some key factors that need to be taken considered whilst 
counselling a patient and understanding his choice of treatment, which might not 
always be match with the clinicians' recommendation.

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine the range of perioperative mortality rates 
associated with the Ross procedure that results in a life expectancy similar to 
that seen with mechanical aortic valve replacement (mAVR) in young patients with 
aortic valve disease.
METHODS: A fully probabilistic Markov microsimulation model with 1000 outer 
loops and 10 000 inner loops was constructed to compare gain in life expectancy 
and quality-adjusted life years between the index treatment with the Ross 
procedure versus mAVR for a theoretical cohort of young patients with aortic 
valve disease. Inputs for early deaths and late complications (death, stroke, 
bleeding, reoperation) were obtained from a single-centre study of 208 
propensity score matched patients. In the primary analysis, the perioperative 
mortality rate for the Ross procedure was varied by increments of 0.5% to 
determine its impact on life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years. A 2-way 
sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine simultaneously the impact of the 
Ross reoperation rate and Ross reoperative mortality rate on life expectancy.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was improved with the Ross procedure when the 
perioperative mortality rate with the Ross procedure was <2.5% and was 
equivalent to mAVR when the mortality rate was 2.5% to 5%. Similarly, when the 
perioperative mortality rate of the Ross procedure was between 4% and 5.5%, the 
quality-adjusted life years gained were similar between the Ross procedure and 
mAVR. Life expectancy was improved when the Ross procedure reoperative mortality 
rate was <7% at an incidence of Ross reoperations of 18% at 20 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved life expectancy can be expected with the Ross procedure 
when the operative mortality rate is less than 2.5%.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an EQ-5D-5L value set 
reflecting the health preferences of the Malaysian adult population.
METHODS: Respondents were sampled with quotas for urbanicity, gender, age, and 
ethnicity to ensure representativeness of the Malaysian population. The study 
was conducted using a standardized protocol involving the EuroQol Valuation 
Technology (EQ-VT) computer-assisted interview system. Respondents were 
administered ten composite time trade-off (C-TTO) tasks and seven discrete 
choice experiment (DCE) tasks. Both linear main effects and constrained 
non-linear regression models of C-TTO-only data and hybrid models combining 
C-TTO and DCE data were explored to determine an efficient and informative model 
for value set prediction.
RESULTS: Data from 1125 respondents representative of the Malaysian population 
were included in the analysis. Logical consistency was present in all models 
tested. Using cross-validation, eight-parameter models for C-TTO only and 
C-TTO + DCE hybrid data displayed greater out-of-sample predictive accuracy than 
their 20-parameter, main-effect counterparts. The hybrid eight-parameter model 
was chosen to represent the Malaysian value set, as it displayed greater 
out-of-sample predictive accuracy over C-TTO data than the C-TTO-only model, and 
produced more precise estimates. The estimated value set ranged from - 0.442 to 
1.
CONCLUSIONS: The constrained eight-parameter hybrid model demonstrated the best 
potential in representing the Malaysian value set. The presence of the Malaysian 
EQ-5D-5L value set will facilitate its application in research and health 
technology assessment activities.

INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that was associated with greater 
reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) versus 
once-daily GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in a recent network meta-analysis (NMA). 
The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus liraglutide 1.2 mg in Estonia.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model (version 9.0), with baseline cohort characteristics sourced from 
SUSTAIN 3 and changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and BMI 
associated with once-weekly semaglutide and liraglutide derived from the NMA. 
Patients were assumed to receive once-weekly semaglutide or liraglutide for 
5 years before intensifying to basal insulin. Treatment effects were applied for 
the first 5 years, after which HbA1c increased to 7.0%, SBP followed a natural 
progression, and BMI reverted to baseline for the remainder of the analysis. 
Costs were expressed in euros (EUR) and estimated from a healthcare payer 
perspective. Utilities associated with diabetes and diabetes-related 
complications were taken from published sources.
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.13 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
versus liraglutide 1.2 mg. Direct costs were EUR 67 higher with once-weekly 
semaglutide, due to the increased acquisition cost, but this was mostly offset 
by cost savings due to avoidance of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly 
semaglutide 1 mg was therefore associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of EUR 523 per QALY gained versus liraglutide 1.2 mg, which falls well 
below a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 52,390 per QALY gained (three times 
the Estonian GDP per capita).
CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide was considered highly cost-effective versus 
liraglutide 1.2 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in 
Estonia.

Contemporary Management of Heart Failure in the Elderly.

The foundation of the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
is a number of pharmacotherapies shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in 
large randomised multinational clinical trials. These include angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and more recently, a combined 
angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril/valsartan. In 
select cases, digoxin, ivabradine and hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate have 
a role to play in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 
On this foundation, other more advanced treatments such as implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy are 
recommended in guidelines for the treatment of heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (i.e. an ejection fraction of ≤ 40%) and for a select few 
there remains the option of mechanical circulatory support and cardiac 
transplantation. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy does not vary by age and each 
of these therapies should be considered in all patients, irrespective of age. 
Other factors such as co-morbidities like renal dysfunction may limit the use of 
some of these drugs in the elderly. Decision making with regard to device 
therapy is more complex; the likelihood of competing non-cardiovascular causes 
of death and life expectancy need to be considered. Despite multiple treatment 
options for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the options for heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction are limited. In the absence of robust 
outcomes data from a large randomised trial, a mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonist is a reasonable therapy to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for 
heart failure in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Systemic mastocytosis in adults: 2019 update on diagnosis, risk stratification 
and management.

Pardanani A(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 
Minnesota.

OVERVIEW: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation of 
abnormal mast cells (MCs) in extra-cutaneous organs.
DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of abnormal MC 
in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase 
level, abnormal MC CD25 expression, and presence of KITD816V mutation.
RISK STRATIFICATION: Establishing SM subtype as per the World Health 
Organization classification system is an important first step. Broadly, patients 
either have indolent/smoldering SM (ISM/SSM) or advanced SM, the latter includes 
aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and 
mast cell leukemia (MCL). Identification of poor-risk mutations (ie, ASXL1, 
RUNX1, SRSF2, NRAS) further refines the risk stratification. Recently, clinical 
and hybrid clinical-molecular risk models have been developed to more accurately 
assign prognosis in SM patients.
MANAGEMENT: ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and treatment is 
generally limited to anaphylaxis prevention/symptom control/osteoporosis 
treatment. Patients with advanced SM frequently need MC cytoreductive therapy to 
ameliorate disease-related organ dysfunction. High response rates have been seen 
with small-molecule inhibitors that target mutant-KIT, including midostaurin 
(Food and Drug Administration approved) or avapritinib (investigational). Other 
options for MC cytoreduction include cladribine or interferon-α, although 
head-to-head comparisons are lacking. Treatment of SM-AHN primarily targets the 
AHN component, if an aggressive disease such as acute myeloid leukemia is 
present. Allogeneic stem cell transplant can be considered in such patients, or 
in those with relapsed/refractory advanced SM. Imatinib has a limited 
therapeutic role in SM; effective cytoreduction is limited to those with 
imatinib-sensitive KIT mutations.

BACKGROUND: The type of health insurance may affect the likelihood of mortality 
of insured people. We conducted this study to determine if accessing free 
quality health care services could decrease the premature mortality of people in 
a developing country.
METHODS: In a multicenter cross sectional study, "years-life-lost" (YLL) due to 
premature death was evaluated in 202 671 insured people residing in six large 
regions in Iran. The participants had access to free quality health care 
services. The number of insured people that died in the six regions during March 
20, 2014, to March 20, 2015, as well as their sex, age, and cause of the death, 
were collected, and the YLL was calculated based on assumptions made in Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD2010).
RESULTS: The crude mortality rate was 2.3 per 1000, significantly lower than the 
overall rate of 4.6 per 1000 people in general population of Iran. The average 
YLL was 47 years per 1000 persons, significantly lower than that in general 
population of Iran and many industrialized countries. The most common causes of 
death (and YLL) were cardiovascular diseases and malignancies.
CONCLUSION: Having access to free quality health care services is associated 
with a significant decrease in premature death.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: An assessment of transition of cancer in India during 
the past 30 years, according to changes in demographic and epidemiologic risk 
factors was undertaken.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Cancer registry data (http://www.ncdirindia.org), 
(population coverage <10%), was compared with transition in life-expectancy and 
prevalence on smoking, alcohol and obesity. We fitted linear regression to the 
natural logarithm of the estimated incidence rates of various cancer registries 
in India.
RESULTS: Burden of cancer in India increased from 0.6 million in 1991 to 1.4 
million in 2015. Among males, common cancers are lung (12.0%), mouth (11.4%), 
prostate (7.0%), and tongue (7.0%) and among females, they are breast (21.0%), 
cervix-uteri (12.1%), ovary (6.9%), and lung (4.9%) in 2012. Increased 
life-expectancy and population growth as well as increased use of alcohol and 
increased prevalence of overweight/obesity reflected an increase in all cancers 
in both genders except a reduction in infection-related cancers such as 
cervix-uteri and tobacco-related cancers such as pharynx (excludes nasopharynx) 
and oesophagus.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Transition in demographics and epidemiologic risk 
factors, reflected an increase in all cancers in both genders except a reduction 
in a few cancers. The increasing incidence of cancer and its associated factors 
demands a planned approach to reduce its burden. The burden assessment needs to 
be strengthened by increasing the population coverage of cancer registries. 
Continued effort for tobacco prevention and public health efforts for reducing 
obesity and alcohol consumption are needed to reduce the cancer burden.

The liver is the most common site for metastasis from colorectal cancers (CRCs). 
There are so many new armamentarium, which have increased the life expectancy 
and progression-free survival. There are various available guidelines, such as 
NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO, which provide an insight into the latest modalities and 
new protocols. We have tried to elucidate into paradigm shift of the management.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, chronic and debilitating genetic disease 
caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane-Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. 
Unrelenting airway disease begins in infancy and produces a steady deterioration 
in quality of life, ultimately leading to premature death. While life expectancy 
has improved, current treatments for CF are neither preventive nor curative. 
Since the discovery of CFTR the vision of correcting the underlying genetic 
defect - not just treating the symptoms - has been developed to where it is 
poised to become a transformative technology. Addition of a properly functioning 
CFTR gene into defective airway cells is the only biologically rational way to 
prevent or treat CF airway disease for all CFTR mutation classes. While new gene 
editing approaches hold exciting promise, airway gene-addition therapy remains 
the most encouraging therapeutic approach for CF. However, early work has not 
yet progressed to large-scale clinical trials. For clinical trials to begin in 
earnest the field must demonstrate that gene therapies are safe in CF lungs; can 
provide clear health benefits and alter the course of lung disease; can be 
repeatedly dosed to boost effect; and can be scaled effectively from small 
animal models into human-sized lungs. Demonstrating the durability of these 
effects demands relevant CF animal models and accurate and reliable techniques 
to measure benefit. In this review, illustrated with data from our own studies, 
we outline recent technological developments and discuss these key questions 
that we believe must be answered to progress CF airway gene-addition therapies 
to clinical trials.

The absence of cardiac symptoms, the improved exercise tolerance and the 
increased life expectancy are the advantages of a successful cardiac device 
therapy. Nevertheless, the fact of a lifelong device dependency, the inherent 
possibility of device malfunction and the progression of the underlying heart 
disease may impact the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the 
psychological adjustment of these individuals. To date, an overview of findings 
on these topics is lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate and 
summarize the current evidence on generic and disease-specific HRQoL and 
psychological adjustment in paediatric patients with a pacemaker (PM) or an 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). A systematic literature search was 
conducted using relevant databases and predefined keywords. Study selection was 
conducted based on predefined inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies were selected 
which were of varying methodological quality. Overall, the studies indicated 
that PM/ICD patients themselves and their parents scored lower than healthy 
controls on generic HRQoL scales and reported similar disease-related HRQoL as 
patients with severe forms of congenital heart disease. Regarding psychological 
adjustment outcome, PM recipients and norms were not significantly different 
with respect to anxiety and depression symptoms, while ICD patients showed more 
signs of anxiety than depression. HRQoL and psychological health should be 
considered when setting therapy goals and evaluating medical treatment success. 
This approach allows an early intervention in patients at risk of maladaptation, 
which is especially important in the young patient undergoing crucial 
developmental stages.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency 
(C1-INH-HAE) is a rare disease characterized by diminished levels or 
dysfunctional activity of C1-INH, leading to dysregulated plasma kallikrein 
activity within the kallikrein-kinin pathway. Symptoms manifest as painful, 
potentially life-threatening swelling of subcutaneous tissues throughout the 
body and/or submucosal edema in the upper airway or gastrointestinal tract. 
Attacks recur with unpredictable frequency, intensity, and duration, placing a 
heavy burden on patients' daily lives. Despite improved availability of 
medications for on-demand treatment during attacks and prophylaxis of future 
attacks, unmet needs remain. Lanadelumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, may 
help address some of the limitations of existing prophylactic options (e.g., the 
need for intravenous administration or frequent dosing). Preclinical studies 
demonstrate that it is highly potent and specifically inhibits plasma 
kallikrein, and findings from phase Ia and Ib studies suggest this agent is well 
tolerated and provides sustained inhibition of plasma kallikrein, allowing for 
less frequent dosing. The phase III HELP Study (NCT02586805) evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of lanadelumab in preventing HAE attacks has been completed, 
and its open-label extension (NCT02741596) is ongoing. Lanadelumab is now 
approved in the USA and Canada for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in 
patients aged ≥ 12 years. This review provides an overview of the discovery and 
clinical development of lanadelumab, from preclinical through phase Ib studies, 
characterizing its safety/tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic profiles. It also highlights how this agent may positively 
impact clinical care of patients with C1-INH-HAE.

Personality disorder: a disease in disguise.

Ekselius L(1).

Author information:
(1)a Department of Neuroscience, Psychiatry , Uppsala University , Sweden.

Personality disorders (PDs) can be described as the manifestation of extreme 
personality traits that interfere with everyday life and contribute to 
significant suffering, functional limitations, or both. They are common and are 
frequently encountered in virtually all forms of health care. PDs are associated 
with an inferior quality of life (QoL), poor health, and premature mortality. 
The aetiology of PDs is complex and is influenced by genetic and environmental 
factors. The clinical expression varies between different PD types; the most 
common and core aspect is related to an inability to build and maintain healthy 
interpersonal relationships. This aspect has a negative impact on the 
interaction between health-care professionals and patients with a PD. From being 
discrete and categorical disease entities in previous classification systems, 
the current concept of PD, reflected in the newly proposed ICD-11, is a 
dimensional description based on the severity of the disturbed functioning 
rather than on the type of clinical presentation. Insight about the 
characteristics of PDs among medical practitioners is limited, which is partly 
because persons do not seek health care for their PD, but instead for other 
medical issues which are obscured by their underlying personality problems. What 
needs to be emphasized is that PDs affect both the clinical presentation of 
other medical problems, and the outcome of these, in a negative manner and that 
the integrated effects of having a PD are a shortened life expectancy. 
Accordingly, PDs need to be recognized in clinical practice to a greater extent 
than previously.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an illness 
with significant healthcare and societal impacts. Fixed combinations of 
long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids have been used for 
COPD treatment as the standard of care for many years. A daily dose of 
indacaterol and glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) at 110/50 µg has recently been gaining 
attention due to its improved efficacy and tolerability versus the standard of 
care.The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of once daily IND/GLY vs. 
twice daily salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (SFC) at 50/500 µg in COPD 
patients.
METHODS: A microsimulation model in MS Excel was adapted to the Czech setting. 
Effectiveness data and disease severity stages were obtained from the FLAME 
study, which is a head-to head trial comparing IND/GLY vs. SFC. Quality of life 
data were derived from a literature review. Costs (medication, monitoring and 
complications) were taken from published Czech sources. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 %. A lifetime 
horizon was used for the analysis. Cost-effectiveness was studied from the 
perspective of a health care system in the Czech Republic.
RESULTS: Mean QALYs were higher in the IND/GLY arm (difference 0.167 QALYs). The 
ICER of IND/GLY compared with SFC was €13,628 per QALY gained. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
base-case result to be robust.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Czech health care system, managing COPD 
using IND/GLY is cost-effective in this analysis because the base-case is 
clearly below the willingness-to-pay threshold in the Czech Republic, which is 
automatically set at 3 times GDP/capita (approximately €44,000/ QALY). This is 
the first available economic analysis utilizing FLAME study results in the 
Central East European (CEE) countries showing IND/ GLY as a highly 
cost-effective investment into COPD patients.

As total life expectancy increases, the prevalence of age-related diseases such 
as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is also increasing. Many hypotheses about 
Alzheimer's disease have been developed, including cholinergic neuron damage, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation. Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter in 
the brain and cholinergic deficits leads to cognitive dysfunction and decline. 
Recent studies have linked diabetes as a risk factor in developing Alzheimer's 
disease and other types of dementia. The incidence of patients with type II 
diabetes and increased levels and activity of α-amylase is higher in patients 
with dementia. It has been shown that aromatherapy with essential oils from the 
mint family can improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease patients. 
Selected monoterpenoids from these essential oils are reported to inhibit 
acetylcholinesterase, both in vitro and in vivo. Terpenoids are small, 
fat-soluble organic molecules that can transfer across nasal mucosa if inhaled, 
or penetrate through the skin after topical application, enter into the blood 
and cross the blood-brain barrier. Recent evidence supports the idea that the 
common constituents of essential oils also inhibit α-amylase, a starch digestive 
enzyme that plays an important role in the control of diabetes. The mint family 
is a fragrant plant family that contains most of the culinary herbs found in the 
Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is considered to be one of the 
healthiest diets in the world, and is found to be beneficial not only for the 
heart but also for the brain. Herbs used in this diet are rich in antioxidants 
that can prevent oxidative damage caused by free radicals. However, our study 
shows that they also contain biologically active compounds with potent α-amylase 
and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Consumption of fresh herbs can 
help boost memory and reduce sugar levels in the body. The use of herbs as a 
functional food could lead to significant improvements in health. Cognitive 
stimulation with medical food and medical herbs could delay development of 
cognitive decline, and improve the quality of life of Alzheimer's disease 
patients. This effect can be enhanced if combined with aromatherapy, topically 
or by inhalation, and/or by ingestion. Terpenes and terpenoids, the primary 
constituents of these essential oils are small, lipid soluble organic molecules 
that can be absorbed through the skin or across nasal mucosa into the systemic 
blood circulation. Many terpenes can also cross the blood-brain barrier. 
Therefore, topical application or inhalation of essential oils will also produce 
a systemic effect.

BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is a transdiagnostic risk factor for later 
psychopathology and has been associated with altered brain circuitry involved in 
the processing of threat and safety. Examining threat generalization mechanisms 
in young adults with childhood maltreatment and psychiatric symptoms may 
elucidate a pathway linking early-life adversities to the presence of 
subclinical psychopathology.
METHODS: We recruited youth aged 16–25 years with subclinical psychiatric 
symptomatology and healthy controls. They were dichotomized into 2 groups: 1 
with a high level of childhood maltreatment (n = 58) and 1 with no or a low 
level of childhood maltreatment (n = 55). Participants underwent a functional 
MRI threat generalization paradigm, measuring self-reported fear, expectancy of 
an unconditioned stimulus (US) and neural responses.
RESULTS: We observed interactions between childhood maltreatment and threat 
generalization indices on subclinical symptom load. In individuals reporting 
high levels of childhood maltreatment, enhanced generalization in self-reported 
fear and US expectancy was related to higher levels of psychopathology. Imaging 
results revealed that in the group with high levels of childhood maltreatment, 
lower activation in the left hippocampus during threat generalization was 
associated with a higher symptom load. Associations between threat 
generalization and psychopathology were nonsignificant overall in the group with 
no or low levels of childhood maltreatment.
LIMITATIONS: The data were acquired in a cross-sectional manner, precluding 
definitive insight into the causality of childhood maltreatment, threat 
generalization and psychopathology.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that threat generalization mechanisms may 
moderate the link between childhood maltreatment and subclinical psychopathology 
during emerging adulthood. Threat generalization could represent a vulnerability 
factor for developing later psychopathology in individuals being exposed to 
childhood maltreatment.
