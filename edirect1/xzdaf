developed country, such as England: 11.98 (11.45-12.55) to 10.37 (9.85-10.9), 
and 3.75 (3.68-3.84) to 2.82 (2.75-2.9) per 100,000 women, respectively. Poorer 
regions of Brazil had greater rates of the disease; for instance, Amapá State in 
the Northern Region had rates twice as high as the national rates during the 
same period. Cervical cancer was the leading cause of premature cancer-related 
mortality (YLL = 100.69, 91.48-110.61 per 100,000 women) among young women 
(25-29 years) in Brazil and eight federation units of all country regions except 
the Southeast in 2017. There was a decrease in the burden of cervical cancer in 
Brazil from 339.59 (330.82-348.83) DALYs per 100,000 women in 2000 to 238.99 
(230.45-247.99) DALYs per 100,000 women in 2017.
CONCLUSION: Although there has been a reduction in the burden of cervical cancer 
in Brazil, the rates remain high, mainly among young women. The persistence of 
inequalities between regions of Brazil suggests the importance of socioeconomic 
determinants in the burden for this cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are at a high risk of anaemia, with iron-folate 
deficiency being the most common cause of anaemia among pregnant women. Despite 
the well-known importance of iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS) during 
pregnancy, adherence to these supplements is relatively low and associated 
factors were not well identified in the study area. This study is aimed at 
investigating adherence to IFAS and associated factors among pregnant women in 
Kasulu district, north-western Tanzania.
METHODS: A health facility cross-sectional survey with a mixed-method approach 
was conducted in Kasulu district from March to April 2019. A structured 
questionnaire was given to 320 women with children aged 0-6 months to assess 
factors associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women. Data were 
entered into SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Binary logistic regression was 
further employed to determine the factors associated with adherence to IFAS. 
Focus group discussions were done with 19 pregnant women and 15 mothers of 
children aged 0-6 months to obtain more clarifications on the factors associated 
with adherence to IFAS. Furthermore, in-depth interviews were done with six 
health care providers to explore their perceptions of IFAS.
RESULTS: Out of the 320 respondents of the survey, 20.3% (n = 65) adhered to 
IFAS. Factors associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women included 
time to start ANC (AOR = 3.72, 95% CI: 1.42, 9.79), knowledge of anaemia (AOR = 
3.84, 95% CI: 1.335, 10.66), counseling on the importance of the iron-folic acid 
(AOR = 3.86, 95% CI: 1.42, 10.50), IFAS given during clinical visit (AOR = 
15.72, 95% CI: 5.34, 46.31), number of meals consumed (AOR = 3.44, 95% CI: 1.28, 
9.21), number of children (AOR = 3.462, 95% CI: 1.035, 11.58), and distance to 
health facility (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.131, 0.886). Qualitative findings 
revealed that delayed first ANC visit, lack of remainder for pregnant women to 
take IFAS, low awareness about the negative effects of anaemia, low of knowledge 
of IFAS and management of side effects, negative beliefs about the use of IFAS, 
and follow-up mechanism were major reasons for poor adherence.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to iron-folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was 
low. Strengthening systems for creating reminding mechanism, raising community 
awareness through educational programs to pregnant women and health providers 
could improve adherence to IFAS.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in Japan has increased dramatically and is one of 
the longest in the world. However, the changes in lifespan in Japanese 
individuals with congenital diseases remain unknown. We investigated secular 
changes in the lifespan of people with Down syndrome over the last 20 years.
METHODS: We observed secular trends in the number of stillbirths, deaths and the 
mortality rates at ages 20, 40, and 60 among all deaths registered with Down 
syndrome as the cause of death (ICD10 code: Q90) in the Japan national death 
registry database between 1995 and 2016. Changes in the median age at death 
between 1995-2005 and 2006-2016 were investigated based on sex and history of 
surgery.
RESULTS: We identified 240 stillbirths and 1,099 deaths in this period. The 
annual number of stillbirths and deaths above the age of 1 year increased, 
whereas the number of deaths below 1 year did not change. The proportional 
mortality indicator at ages 20, 40, and 60 increased from 21.7%, 11.7%, and 1.7% 
in 1995 to 69.9%, 66.7%, and 36.6% in 2016, respectively. The median age at 
death was higher in females, individuals without a surgical history, and deaths 
occurring in 2006-2016. The median age at death increased over the period in 
those without a surgical history.
CONCLUSIONS: The age at death among people with Down syndrome has increased over 
the last 20 years, with currently 1 in 3 persons living over 60 years, 
necessitating adequate social welfare services in this aging population.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is associated with complex health care needs and, although 
improved, a continued shortened life expectancy. In order to quantify and 
understand advances in the diagnosis and management of CP, systematic literature 
searches of key word groupings in the PubMed database were completed and 
revealed a recent increased incidence of publications focusing on quality of 
life, physical activity, exercise, and treatment options. Our bibliometric 
exploration revealed growing emphasis on function, performance, aging, and 
health compared to earlier studies when diagnostic features and brain pathology 
dominated research. Our findings highlight the transition from diagnosis and 
identification to management of specific conditions and providing guidance for 
the continuum of needs our patients experience over the course of a lifetime. 
The field must be prepared to advance our understanding of best practices and 
implement evidence-based interventions and management options.

Most of the human gene homologs are found in Caenorhabditis elegans. As a wide 
variety of micro-organisms present in the environment is pathogens, so, C. 
elegans could be a useful model to track future infectious disease. With this 
knowledge, in this study, we isolated Acinetobacter courvalinii from the soil 
and characterized its pathogenicity for the first time. For the isolation, we 
used Glucose-Yeast extract-Ethanol-Calcium carbonate medium. To this aim, we 
evaluated the resistivity of bacteria against several stressful 
microenvironments. As we observed, A. courvalinii JP_A1001 shown highly 
tolerance against the acidic environment (pH 3-7), resistant against up to 0.2% 
of phenol content, and survived in the medium supplemented with 0.3% of bile 
salt. In addition, the bacteria were also resistant against several antibiotics 
showing the property of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the isolated 
bacteria have shown the biofilm formation ability within 60 h. Further, we found 
that incubation of C. elegans with A. courvalinii JP_A1001 decreased the body 
movement and increased the free radical generation which remarkably influenced 
the life expectancy of C. elegans compared to E. coli OP50. Therefore, we 
concluded that A. courvalinii JP_A1001 found in the soil could be a future 
threat as a pathogen to public health.

This study was conducted to explore the potential capacity for the removal of 
heavy metals from the fly ash (FA) and bottom ash (BA) emitted by wood pellet 
thermal power plants. Fly ash consists of inorganic compounds such as CaSiO3, 
P2O5, and K2O, whereas BA shows properties very similar to the biochar derived 
from organic biomass. The adsorption properties of both FA and BA for Cd were 
described well by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models, and the maximum 
adsorption capacity of FA for Cd was 4.2 times higher than that of BA. The 
results indicate that FA can be applied to the treatment of wastewater that 
contains heavy metals over pH range from 2-6; however, BA is considered to be 
most effective for application with wastewater that contains heavy metals at a 
pH of 5-6. Study of the mechanism concluded that the adsorption of Cd by FA is 
dominated by the formation of Cd2SiO4 complexes by chemical reactions between 
CaSiO3 and Cd ions as well as via the precipitation of Cd(OH)2 in the neutral 
and alkaline solutions that is caused by the dissolution of K. It was found that 
the adsorption of Cd by BA was influenced by the binding of functional groups 
(CC and COH), coupled CaCO3 dissolution-CdCO3 precipitation reaction and ion 
exchange between some minerals with Si and Cd ions in weakly acidic conditions. 
Results indicate that the FA and BA emitted from wood pellet thermal power 
plants have high potential for heavy metal removal, and their practical use in 
the purification and restoration of heavy metals could be an effective way to 
reduce the waste produced by power plants and clean the environment.

In Switzerland by 2045, we expect 2.7 Mio citizens aged 65+ of whom 1.0 Mio. 
aged 80+. A priority and focus of personalized health research is therefore 
aging biology to extend healthy life expectancy. Novel molecular and imaging 
features will emerge as candidate targets for risk prediction and screening of 
chronic diseases. It is of utmost importance to test the clinical and public 
health utility of candidate biomarkers evolving from this research in citizen 
reference cohorts. We will build a Swiss Aging Citizen Reference (SACR), a 
testable and scalable reference cohort offering interoperable, searchable, and 
accessible data. 1000 participants from existing Swiss citizen cohorts will be 
combined and analyzed for DNA methylation and MRI brain imaging. SACR will serve 
as a testbed for clinical and public health utility of candidate biomarkers. As 
for a proof-of-concept study, we will conduct an agnostic search for structural 
and functional brain features associated with epigenetic aging acceleration to 
examine the potential of epigenetic age acceleration as the intermediate aging 
biomarker and to better understand the aging mechanism in brain.

Today, the world is facing the challenge of a major pandemic due to COVID-19, 
which has caused more than 6.1 million cases of infection and nearly 370,000 
deaths so far. Most of the deaths from the disease are clustered in the older 
population, but the young and children are not spared. In this context, there is 
a critical need to revisit the formula for calculating potential years of life 
lost (PYLL). Data on age-specific deaths due to COVID-19 in three countries, 
including the United States (US), Italy, and Germany, were evaluated. New York 
State, as a significant outlier within the US, was also included. PYLLs in the 
US were five times as high as those of Italy. Compared with Germany, PYLLs in 
Italy were 4 times higher, and the rates in the US were 23, 25, and 18 times 
higher when using upper age limits of 70, 75, and 80, respectively. Standardized 
PYLLs in New York were 2 times as high as the rates in Italy, and 7 to 9 times 
as high as PYLLs in Germany. The revised formula of PYLL, using an upper limit 
of age 80, is recommended to accurately measure premature deaths due to a major 
disastrous disease such as COVID-19.

(1) Introduction: This study aims to investigate the disparity in the healthy 
life expectancy of the elderly with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. (2) 
Materials and Methods: This study used survey data collected in five waves 
(1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011) of the "Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging" 
(TLSA) to estimate the life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of different 
age groups. The activities of daily living, the health condition of hypertension 
and diabetes and the survival statuses of these cases were analyzed by the IMaCh 
(Interpolated Markov Chain) and logistic regression model. (3) Results: As 
regards the elderly between age 50 and 60 with hypertension and diabetes, women 
with hypertension only exhibited the longest life expectancy, and the healthy 
life expectancy and the percentage of remaining life with no functional 
incapacity were 33.74 years and 87.11%, respectively. In contrast, men with 
diabetes only showed the shortest life expectancy, and the healthy life 
expectancy and the percentage of remaining life with no functional incapacity 
were 22.51 years and 93.16%, respectively. We also found that people with 
diabetes showed a lower percentage of remaining life with no functional 
incapacity. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that policymakers should pay special 
attention to publicizing the importance of health control behavior in order to 
decrease the risk of suffering diseases and to improve the elderly's quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD) population, performing secondary tasks 
while walking further deteriorates gait and restrict mobility in functional 
contexts of daily life. This study (1) analyzed the interference of functional 
cognitive and motor secondary task on untrained people with PD and (2) compared 
their walking with healthy subjects.
METHODS: Forty people with PD (aged 66.72 [7.5] years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 
I-II-III, on-medication) composed the PD group (PDG) and 43 participants (aged 
66.60 [8.75] years) formed the group of healthy counterparts (HG). Gait was 
evaluated through spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic outcomes in five 
conditions: single task (ST) and visual, verbal, auditory and motor dual-task 
(DT).
RESULTS: The velocity, stride length, and braking force performance of both 
groups was statistically higher in the ST condition than in verbal, auditory and 
motor DT (p < .05), and inferior in double support time and midstance force 
(p < .05). The same pattern was observed when compared the ST and visual DT 
condition, where participants showed a significantly higher stride length, 
double support time and braking force in the ST (p < .05). In addition, the PDG 
exhibited a significant shorter double support time and midstance force, and 
showed a higher braking force in the visual DT than in the verbal DT (p < .05). 
Similarly, the PDG showed a wider stride in the visual DT than in the motor DT 
condition (p < .05). PDG participants had a significantly lower performance than 
the HG in all the variables analyzed except for the maximum hip extension in the 
stance phase (p > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: In untrained participants with PD, verbal and motor secondary tasks 
affect gait significantly, while auditory and visual tasks interfere to a lesser 
extent. Untrained people with PD have a poorer gait performance than their 
healthy counterparts, but in different grades according to the analyzed 
variables.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The data in this paper are part of a single-blind, 
randomized, controlled trial and correspond to the evaluations performed before 
a physical rehabilitation program, retrospectively registered with the number at

Patients with psychiatric disorders have a decrease in their life expectancy. 
Excess mortality of patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated by a 
meta-analysis in the late 1990s and has not decreased for the past 30years. A 
recent meta-analysis including nearly 250,000 patients with schizophrenia found 
an average decrease in life expectancy of 14.5years (CI95: 11,2-17,8), more 
important for men than for women: 15.9 (CI95: 13,8-18,0) vs 13.6 (CI95: 
11,4-15,8). A closer look at the somatic comorbidities, including metabolic 
syndrome, and investigation of causes of death of these patients highlighted 
already well-known factors, namely late diagnosis and insufficient treatment of 
physical diseases, side effects of antipsychotics, unhealthy lifestyle (poor 
diet, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and lack of exercise), and higher 
risk of suicide and accident. Concerning ultra-high risk (UHR) patients, a 2016 
meta-analysis of 47 studies evaluated the cardiovascular risk factors. They 
reported a higher prevalence of smoking in UHR (odds ratio 2,3) and a lower 
level of physical activity associated with a normal BMI (Body Mass Index) 
compared to the control population. A meta-analysis about patients with a first 
episode of psychosis (FEP) found reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels and an 
increased triglyceride level compared to the control population. One study found 
alteration of the fasting plasmatic levels of glucose and insulin, as well as 
insulin resistance in FEP patients, compared to controls albeit the HbA1c level 
was not significantly different. A meta-analysis reported a prevalence of 
metabolic syndrome of 10 % in FEP or drug naïve patients versus 35 % and 20 % in 
treated and untreated patients with chronic schizophrenia respectively. Somatic 
comorbidities usually appear during the first two years of the disease. Some 
interventions have proven their efficacy in reducing the occurrence of metabolic 
syndrome and other cardiovascular risk factors. For instance, metformin, a 
treatment for type 2 diabetes that is allowed from the age of 10, has shown 
benefits in children and adolescents receiving second-generation antipsychotics 
in a recent meta-analysis, with a mean weight loss of 3.23kg (IC95 % -5.59 
-0.86) after 16 weeks. Dietary-hygienic interventions are also effective in 
reducing cardiovascular risk. Other interventions such as omega-3 
supplementation, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and fasting have not proven to be 
effective. Comprehensive care programs have been developed to promote somatic 
care in psychiatric patients, such as the Canadian HeAL (Healthy Active Lives) 
program. These programs are more effective when proposed from the beginning of 
the disease and the introduction of antipsychotics. In this review, because 
there is no French recommendation, we translate a tool for the prescription of 
metformin and the Canadian recommendations from the HeAL program. Generalization 
of these programs to all young psychotic patients could improve their life 
expectancy and reduce the overall mortality. Prevention of cardiovascular risk 
factors and cardio-metabolic monitoring of treatments must be part of the 
standard of care in early psychosis. These programs aim at providing patients 
with the quality of somatic and mental care they are entitled to. This requires 
the involvement of all stakeholders, including patients and their families but 
also psychiatrists and other caregivers.

Science, NY, USA.

Trade-offs in life-history traits are clinically and mechanistically important. 
Sulfur amino acid restriction (SAAR) extends lifespan. But whether this benefit 
comes at the cost of other traits including stress resistance and growth is 
unclear. We investigated the effects of SAAR on growth markers (body weight, 
IGF1, and IGFBP3) and physiological stresses. Male-F344 rats were fed control 
(0.86% Met) and SAAR (0.17% Met) diets starting at 2, 10, and 20 months. Rats 
were injected with keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin (KLH) to measure immune responses 
(anti-KLH-IgM, anti-KLH-IgG, and delayed-type-hypersensitivity [DTH]). Markers 
of ER stress (FGF21 and adiponectin), detoxification capacity (glutathione [GSH] 
concentrations, GSH-S-transferase [GST], and cytochrome-P450 -reductase [CPR] 
activities), and low-grade inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) were also 
determined. SAAR decreased body weight, liver weight, food intake, plasma IGF1, 
and IGFBP3; the effect size diminished with increasing age-at-onset. SAAR 
increased FGF21 and adiponectin, but stress damage markers GRP78 and Xbp1s/us 
were unchanged, suggesting that ER stress is hormetic. SAAR increased hepatic 
GST activity despite lower GSH, but CPR activity was unchanged, indicative of 
enhanced detoxification capacity. Other stress markers were either uncompromised 
(CRP, anti-KLH-IgM, and DTH) or slightly lower (anti-KLH-IgG). Increases in 
stress markers were similar across all ages-at-onset, except for adiponectin, 
which peaked at 2 months. Overall, SAAR did not compromise stress responses and 
resulted in maximal benefits with young-onset. In survival studies, median 
lifespan extension with initiation at 52 weeks was 7 weeks (p = .05); less than 
the 33.5-week extension observed in our previous study with 7-week initiation. 
Findings support SAAR translational studies and the need to optimize Met dose 
based on age-at-onset.

Aim: Cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis of empagliflozin+standard of care (SoC) 
compared with SoC and liraglutide+SoC, in patients with Type II diabetes and 
established cardiovascular disease, was conducted using evidence from 
cardiovascular outcomes trials. Methods: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model was 
calibrated to predict same outcomes observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and LEADER 
trials. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of SoC, empagliflozin+SoC and 
liraglutide+SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and an indirect 
comparison. Time horizon was 50 years and the UK payer perspective was taken. 
Results: Empagliflozin+SoC dominated liraglutide+SoC with greater 
quality-adjusted life years and reduced costs. Base-case incremental CE ratio of 
6428 GBP/QALY was observed for empagliflozin+SoC versus SoC. Conclusion: Results 
suggest that empagliflozin+SoC is cost effective versus SoC and liraglutide+SoC.

Feasibility and reliability of the Assessing Levels of Physical Activity 
health-related fitness test battery in adults with intellectual disabilities.

Seville, Seville, Spain.

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) seem to have a lower 
physical fitness (PF) than their peers without disabilities, which coincides 
with reduced autonomy, life expectancy and quality of life. To assess PF in 
these individuals, it is necessary to use appropriate tools that permit the 
assessment of their physical capacities taking into account their specific 
characteristics. The aim of this work is to study the feasibility and 
reliability of the Assessing Levels of Physical Activity (ALPHA)-Fit test 
battery for adults in a group of men and women with mild to moderate ID.
METHODS: Forty-one adults with ID of both sexes, ranging in age from 20 to 
60 years old, participated in the study. To identify the feasibility and 
reliability of the ALPHA-Fit test battery for adults, two complete assessments 
were done for each one of the tests included in the battery. The assessments 
were performed for a period of no more than 2 weeks (test-retest). An intraclass 
correlation coefficient was used to determinate test-retest reliability, and a 
mixed analysis of variance factorial was used for each of the dependent 
variables. Bland-Altman plots were also used to assess consistency between the 
two measurements. Feasibility was calculated as the percentage of people who 
were able to perform the tests correctly (not feasible <50%, fairly feasible 
50%-75% and feasible >75%). In order to determine other psychometric properties, 
minimal detectable change and standard error of measurement (SEM) were also 
calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 10 tests in the ALPHA-Fit test battery, eight were shown to be 
feasible. High reliability was obtained (>0.90) for the variables related to 
body composition. In the hand-grip test, reliability was high in the men's group 
but low in the women's group. Good reliability results were also found 
(0.80-0.89) in the dynamic sit-up test for women, but not for men. Fair 
reliability (0.70-0.79) was found in jump-and-reach and neck-shoulder mobility 
tests. The variables in the 2-km walk and agility tests indicated poor 
reliability. All tests showed SEM values related to high variability. However, 
Bland-Altman plots showed results related to lack of consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility and reliability calculations, as well as the SEM 
values, confirm that not all the tests of the ALPHA-Fit Test Battery for Adults 
are suitable for the assessment of PF in adults with ID, probably because of the 
complexity of the motor fitness tests. The authors emphasise the necessity of 
making adaptations to the protocols used or of using other tests more 
appropriate to the characteristics of people with mild to moderate ID.

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of differences and inequalities in health 
require a broad-based approach to the study of masculinities and men's health. 
Interest in this issue has grown in parallel to increased concern over specific 
risks and vulnerabilities faced by men, but also due to the need to involve them 
in programs capable of promoting progress towards gender-based health equity. 
This article attempts to reframe these issues from the perspective of public 
health, providing a wider viewpoint on men's health situated within debates on 
the social determinants of health and the analysis of health inequalities. Based 
on a relational gender approach, we formulate some recommendations regarding 
policy and research agendas, which we argue can contribute to advancing the 
study and development of programs from a gender-based perspective in health.

Publisher: Llevar a cabo un análisis más integral y profundo de las diferencias

las masculinidades y la salud de los hombres en el momento actual. Estamos ante 
un tema cuyo interés ha ido a la par de la creciente preocupación por los 
riesgos y vulnerabilidades específicas de los hombres, pero también de la 
necesidad de involucrarlos en programas con capacidad de promover cambios 
positivos en el orden de género hacia la equidad en salud. Este artículo resitúa 
este campo dentro de la salud pública, proporcionando una visión amplificada 
sobre la salud de los hombres dentro del debate de los determinantes sociales de 
la salud y el análisis de las desigualdades. Sobre la base de un enfoque 
relacional de género, se formulan una serie de recomendaciones orientadas a las 
políticas y la investigación, que consideramos pueden contribuir a avanzar en el 
estudio y el desarrollo de programas desde una perspectiva de género en salud.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the possibilities that the hegemonic 
medical model will continue to prevail in the future or if significant changes 
will take place. The discussion will take as a starting point the 
characteristics and current functions of the hegemonic medical model, and 
reexamine them through a look at advancements in artificial intelligence, 
genetic research, and robotics in health-illness-care-prevention processes. The 
analysis takes on issues such as possible increases in life expectancy, what is 
needed to "cure old age," as well as processes that are modifying the 
doctor-patient relationship. It is concluded that although significant changes 
are taking place, the characteristics and functions of the hegemonic medical 
model remain unmoved.

inteligencia artificial, de las investigaciones genéticas y de la robótica, 
referidas a procesos de salud-enfermedad-atención-prevención, entre los que se 
analizan las posibilidades de fuertes incrementos en la esperanza de vida, las 
necesidades de “curar la senectud”, así como los procesos que están modificando 
la relación médico-paciente, llegando a la conclusión de que si bien se observan 
algunas modificaciones sustantivas, las características y funciones del modelo 
médico hegemónico siguen siendo las mismas.

Men have always been present on the public health agenda, primarily from a 
clinical and epidemiological standpoint. In order to expand on these approaches, 
it is necessary to integrate a perspective that takes into account the 
relationship between gender and health. Furthermore, these discussions must 
include reflections on the intersectionality of gender (masculinities) with 
other categories of social differentiation such as race, ethnicity, social 
class, age, and sexuality. The articles selected from the call for papers on 
men, gender, and health at Salud Colectiva offer theoretical and empirical 
contributions that will undoubtedly enrich this debate. Although the articles 
presented here do not explore every possible aspect of this complex problem, 
they provide a starting point for a productive debate on the tensions and gaps 
that still remain in discussions of these issues.

Publisher: Los hombres siempre han estado presentes en las agendas de salud, 
basadas principalmente en enfoques clínicos y epidemiológicos. Para ampliar 
estos enfoques, es necesario abordar el tema desde una perspectiva que tenga en 
cuenta la relación entre género y salud. Además, la discusión debe tener en 
cuenta la interseccionalidad de género (masculinidades) con otras categorías de 
diferenciación social, como raza, etnicidad, clase social, generación, 
sexualidad. Los artículos aprobados en la convocatoria “Hombres, género y salud” 
de la revista Salud Colectiva ofrecen producciones teóricas y empíricas que sin 
duda contribuirán al debate, y aunque este conjunto de textos no agota la 
complejidad del problema, abre un rico debate sobre las tensiones y las brechas 
que aún persisten en las discusiones sobre el tema.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The hip joint is the vital joint that is responsible 
for the bodyweight transfer from the upper body to the lower body. Due to age 
these joints are worn out and need to be replaced by artificial hip implants. 
Wear is the predominant factor that is responsible for the loosening of hip 
implants. The wear occurs between the joints due to various reasons. The wear 
estimation at the design stage gives a clear idea about the life of the implants 
and also minor changes in the design may also significantly increase the life 
expectancy of the implant which can further reduce the rate of revision surgery. 
The linear wear rate is estimated in the taper trunnion surface.
METHODS: In this study, the circular and trapezoidal-shaped stem implant is 
designed, and wear studies are performed at the trunnion junction. The femoral 
head of size 28 mm, acetabular cup thickness of 4 mm, and a backing cup of 
thickness 2 mm are considered for the study. The neck taper radiuses at the top 
surface are altered. Ansys is used to perform the simulations.
RESULTS: At the time of assembly of the femoral head into the stem, the stresses 
were found to be increasing with an increase in the top surface radius of the 
neck taper junctions. However, when the walking conditions are considered for 
wear estimation of implants the circular implants with the 12/14 mm taper 
exhibited the lesser linear wear rate of 0.003 mm/year. The trapezoidal implants 
with the 10/14 mm taper exhibited a lesser linear wear rate of 0.032 mm/year.
CONCLUSIONS: Wear is an important parameter that leads to the revision of 
implants due to loosening. It is found that with the decrease in the taper 
radius at the top surface against the standard 12/14 mm taper there is no 
significant decrease in the wear rate at the taper junction. Overall the 
circular implants exhibited less wear rate results over the trapezoidal-shaped 
stem implants. Due to the less linear wear rate, the circular implant has a 
higher life over the trapezoidal-shaped implant. Further, these implants can be 
manufactured to test using a hip simulator with the same conditions to validate 
the obtained results.

Despite advances in metastatic prostate cancer therapy, expected survival for 
patients in the castration-resistant phase of disease is poor. 
Immune-checkpoints inhibitors significantly prolonged life expectancy in some 
solid tumors and have been evaluated also in advanced stage prostate cancer. The 
majority of data available derive from preliminary phase I and II trials 
evaluating CTLA-4 and PD-1 as monotherapy or in combination with each other, 
vaccines, radiotherapy or targeted/hormonal therapy, achieving only limited 
benefits in terms of biochemical and radiologic responses. There are many 
reasons that may explain why prostate cancer responds poorly to modern 
immunotherapies, such as its characteristic low tumor mutational burden or 
immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. The present review summarizes the 
results obtained treating advanced prostate cancer patients with 
immune-checkpoints inhibitors and analyzes potential mechanisms of both 
resistance and sensitivity, in order to hypothesize possible avenues of special 
interest for future research.

South Koreans' life expectancy has dramatically increased over the last four 
decades. However, the life satisfaction index of older Korean adults has been in 
the bottom third globally. The large majority of older Koreans spend most of the 
day watching television at home. However, concrete evidence regarding the 
effects of leisure involvement on older adults' quality of later life is scant. 
Only a few existing studies have examined the link via cross-sectional survey 
data. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether meaningful 
leisure participation outside the home in older age plays an essential role in 
improving life satisfaction. To achieve the research aim, nationally 
representative panel data from the Korea Employment Information Service were 
used for the data analysis. The results indicated that social and productive 
leisure participation in religious activity, social gatherings, and volunteering 
was significantly related to quality of life in older adults. Moreover, frequent 
participation in travel and cultural activities outside the home were positively 
related to life satisfaction. These findings suggest that participation in 
meaningful leisure activities is a critical factor contributing to subjective 
well-being and good mental health in older Korean adults and should be 
encouraged.
