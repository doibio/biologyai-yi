OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the incremental health benefits of 
pharmaceutical innovations approved between 2011 and 2021 and the share that 
would surpass the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) "size 
of benefit" decision weight thresholds.
METHODS: We identified all US-approved drugs between 2011 and 2021. Health 
benefits, in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each treatment, 
were extracted from published cost-effectiveness analyses. Summary statistics by 
therapeutic area and cell/gene therapy status identified the treatments with the 
largest QALY gains.
RESULTS: The Food and Drug Administration approved 483 new therapies between 
2011 and 2021 and of these 252 had a published cost-effectiveness analysis 
meeting our inclusion criteria. The average incremental health benefits produced 
by these treatments were 1.04 QALYs (SD = 2.00) relative to standard of care, 
with wide variation by therapeutic area. Pulmonary and ophthalmologic therapies 
produced the highest health benefits with 1.47 (SD = 2.17, n = 13) and 1.41 
QALYs gained (SD = 3.53, n = 7), respectively; anesthesiology and urology had 
the lowest gains (< 0.1 QALYs). Cell and gene therapies produced an average 
health benefit that was 4 times greater than noncell and gene therapies (4.13 vs 
0.96). Among the top treatments in terms of incremental QALYs gained, half (10 
of 20) were oncology therapies. Three of 252 treatments (1.2%) met NICE's 
threshold for a "size of benefit" multiplier.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatments for rare disease, oncology, and cell and gene therapies 
produced some of the highest level of health innovation relative to previous 
standard of care, but few therapies would have qualified for NICE's "size of 
benefit" multiplier as currently constructed.

Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, called efferocytosis, requires calcium inside 
and outside of phagocytes. Due to its necessity, calcium flux is sophisticatedly 
modulated, and the level of intracellular calcium in phagocytes is ultimately 
elevated during efferocytosis. However, the role of elevated intracellular 
calcium in efferocytosis remains elusive. Here, we report that Mertk-mediated 
intracellular calcium elevation is necessary for internalization of apoptotic 
cells during efferocytosis. Drastic depletion of intracellular calcium abrogated 
the internalization step of efferocytosis by delaying phagocytic cup extension 
and closure. Especially, the defect of phagocytic cup closure for 
internalization of apoptotic cells was caused by impaired F-actin disassembly 
and the attenuated interaction of Calmodulin with myosin light chain kinase 
(MLCK), leading to diminished myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Genetic 
and pharmacological impairment of the Calmodulin-MLCK-MLC axis or Mertk-mediated 
calcium influx also resulted in inefficient efferocytosis due to a defect in 
internalization of the targets. Taken together, our observations imply that 
intracellular calcium elevation through Mertk-mediated calcium influx 
facilitates efferocytosis by inducing myosin II-mediated contraction and F-actin 
disassembly required for internalization of apoptotic cells.

BACKGROUND: Urothelial bladder cancer is most frequently diagnosed at the 
non-muscle-invasive stage (NMIBC). However, recurrences and interventions for 
intermediate and high-risk NMIBC patients impact the quality of life. Biomarkers 
for patient stratification could help to avoid unnecessary interventions whilst 
indicating aggressive measures when required.
METHODS: In this study, immuno-oncology focused, multiplexed proximity extension 
assays were utilised to analyse plasma (n = 90) and urine (n = 40) samples from 
90 newly-diagnosed and treatment-naïve bladder cancer patients. Public 
single-cell RNA-sequencing and microarray data from patient tumour tissues and 
murine OH-BBN-induced urothelial carcinomas were also explored to further 
corroborate the proteomic findings.
RESULTS: Plasma from muscle-invasive, urothelial bladder cancer patients 
displayed higher levels of MMP7 (p = 0.028) and CCL23 (p = 0.03) compared to 
NMIBC patients, whereas urine displayed higher levels of CD27 (p = 0.044) and 
CD40 (p = 0.04) in the NMIBC group by two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Random 
forest survival and multivariable regression analyses identified increased MMP12 
plasma levels as an independent marker (p < 0.001) associated with shorter 
overall survival (HR = 1.8, p < 0.001, 95% CI:1.3-2.5); this finding was 
validated in an independent patient OLINK cohort, but could not be established 
using a transcriptomic microarray dataset. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses 
indicated tumour-infiltrating macrophages as a putative source of MMP12.
CONCLUSIONS: The measurable levels of tumour-localised, immune-cell-derived 
MMP12 in blood suggest MMP12 as an important biomarker that could complement 
histopathology-based risk stratification. As MMP12 stems from infiltrating 
immune cells rather than the tumor cells themselves, analyses performed on 
tissue biopsy material risk a biased selection of biomarkers produced by the 
tumour, while ignoring the surrounding microenvironment.

The number of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations has 
increased over recent years as a result of population growth, increasing life 
expectancy, adoption of guidelines, and better access to healthcare. 
Device-related infection is, however, one of the most serious complications of 
CIED therapy associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and financial 
healthcare burden. Although many preventive strategies such as administration of 
intravenous antibiotic therapy before implantation are well recognized, 
uncertainties still exist about other regimens. Uncertainties have remained 
about the role of various preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures such as 
skin antiseptics, pocket antibiotic solutions, anti-bacterial envelopes, 
prolonged antibiotics post-implantation, and others. The key aspect to 
successful treatment of definite CIED infections is complete removal of all 
parts of the system and transvenous hardware, including the device and all 
leads. Thus, transvenous lead extraction has been increasing. Expert consensus 
statements on how to prevent, diagnose, and treat CIED infections and on lead 
extraction have been published by the European Heart Rhythm Association in 2020 
and 2018, respectively. The aim of this AIAC position paper is to describe the 
current knowledge on the risks for device-related infections and to assist 
healthcare professionals in their clinical decision making regarding its 
prevention, diagnosis, and management by providing the latest update of the most 
effective strategies.

PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical narrative review was to summarise the existing 
knowledge on the use of anticoagulants and potential adverse events in older 
people at risk of falls with a history of atrial fibrillation or venous 
thromboembolism. The review also offers practical steps prescribers can take 
when (de-)prescribing anticoagulants to maximise safety.
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Embase and Scopus. 
Additional articles were identified by searching reference lists.
RESULTS: Anticoagulants are often underused in older people due to concerns 
about the risk of falls and intracranial haemorrhage. However, evidence suggests 
that the absolute risk is low and outweighed by the reduction in stroke risk. 
DOACs are now recommended first line for most patients due to their favourable 
safety profile. Off-label dose reduction of DOACs is not recommended due to 
reduced efficacy with limited reduction in bleeding risk. Medication review and 
falls prevention strategies should be implemented before prescribing 
anticoagulation. Deprescribing should be considered in severe frailty, limited 
life expectancy and increased bleeding risk (e.g., cerebral microbleeds).
CONCLUSION: When considering whether to (de-)prescribe anticoagulants, it is 
important to consider the risks associated with stopping therapy in addition to 
potential adverse events. Shared decision-making with the patient and their 
carers is crucial as patient and prescriber views often differ.

BACKGROUND: To inform targeted public health strategies, it is crucial to 
understand how coexisting diseases develop over time and their associated 
impacts on patient outcomes and health-care resources. This study aimed to 
examine how psychosis, diabetes, and congestive heart failure, in a cluster of 
physical-mental health multimorbidity, develop and coexist over time, and to 
assess the associated effects of different temporal sequences of these diseases 
on life expectancy in Wales.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used population-scale, 
individual-level, anonymised, linked, demographic, administrative, and 
electronic health record data from the Wales Multimorbidity e-Cohort. We 
included data on all individuals aged 25 years and older who were living in 
Wales on Jan 1, 2000 (the start of follow-up), with follow-up continuing until 
Dec 31, 2019, first break in Welsh residency, or death. Multistate models were 
applied to these data to model trajectories of disease in multimorbidity and 
their associated effect on all-cause mortality, accounting for competing risks. 
Life expectancy was calculated as the restricted mean survival time (bound by 
the maximum follow-up of 20 years) for each of the transitions from the health 
states to death. Cox regression models were used to estimate baseline hazards 
for transitions between health states, adjusted for sex, age, and area-level 
deprivation (Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation [WIMD] quintile).
FINDINGS: Our analyses included data for 1 675 585 individuals (811 393 [48·4%] 
men and 864 192 [51·6%] women) with a median age of 51·0 years (IQR 37·0-65·0) 
at cohort entry. The order of disease acquisition in cases of multimorbidity had 
an important and complex association with patient life expectancy. Individuals 
who developed diabetes, psychosis, and congestive heart failure, in that order 
(DPC), had reduced life expectancy compared with people who developed the same 
three conditions in a different order: for a 50-year-old man in the third 
quintile of the WIMD (on which we based our main analyses to allow 
comparability), DPC was associated with a loss in life expectancy of 13·23 years 
(SD 0·80) compared with the general otherwise healthy or otherwise diseased 
population. Congestive heart failure as a single condition was associated with 
mean a loss in life expectancy of 12·38 years (0·00), and with a loss of 12·95 
years (0·06) when preceded by psychosis and 13·45 years (0·13) when followed by 
psychosis. Findings were robust in people of older ages, more deprived 
populations, and women, except that the trajectory of psychosis, congestive 
heart failure, and diabetes was associated with higher mortality in women than 
men. Within 5 years of an initial diagnosis of diabetes, the risk of developing 
psychosis or congestive heart failure, or both, was increased.
INTERPRETATION: The order in which individuals develop psychosis, diabetes, and 
congestive heart failure as combinations of conditions can substantially affect 
life expectancy. Multistate models offer a flexible framework to assess temporal 
sequences of diseases and allow identification of periods of increased risk of 
developing subsequent conditions and death.

PURPOSE: Advancing age, declining health status, and a shift in benefit/risk 
balance warrant judicious use of preventive medications in older persons, 
including consideration of deprescribing. Lack of guidance on deprescribing is a 
major barrier for prescribers to consider deprescribing in daily practice. The 
aim of this review was to evaluate to what extent osteoporosis guidelines 
include bisphosphonate deprescribing recommendations.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Embase, and 
grey literature. We included guidelines on treatment of osteoporosis with 
bisphosphonates. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full 
texts. Recommendations for deprescribing were extracted, and quality of 
guidelines were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 9345 references, 42 guidelines were included. A total of 32 (76%) 
guidelines included deprescribing recommendations: 29 (69%) guidelines included 
non-specific deprescribing recommendations framed as a drug holiday, of which 2 
(5%) also included specific deprescribing recommendations based on individual 
health context (e.g. life expectancy, frailty, function, preferences/goals). 
Twenty-four (57%) guidelines included practical deprescribing recommendations, 
and 27 (64%) guidelines included recommendations for when deprescribing should 
not be considered.
CONCLUSION: Bisphosphonate deprescribing recommendations in osteoporosis 
guidelines were primarily framed as drug holidays, with limited guidance on how 
to make individualized deprescribing decisions based on individual health 
context. This suggests a need for additional focus on deprescribing in 
osteoporosis guidelines.

The unfinished agenda of communicable diseases among children and adolescents 
before the COVID-19 pandemic, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis of the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019.

GBD 2019 Child and Adolescent Communicable Disease Collaborators.

Erratum in
    Lancet. 2023 Oct 28;402(10412):1528.

BACKGROUND: Communicable disease control has long been a focus of global health 
policy. There have been substantial reductions in the burden and mortality of 
communicable diseases among children younger than 5 years, but we know less 
about this burden in older children and adolescents, and it is unclear whether 
current programmes and policies remain aligned with targets for intervention. 
This knowledge is especially important for policy and programmes in the context 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to use the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study 2019 to systematically characterise the burden of communicable diseases 
across childhood and adolescence.
METHODS: In this systematic analysis of the GBD study from 1990 to 2019, all 
communicable diseases and their manifestations as modelled within GBD 2019 were 
included, categorised as 16 subgroups of common diseases or presentations. Data 
were reported for absolute count, prevalence, and incidence across measures of 
cause-specific mortality (deaths and years of life lost), disability (years 
lived with disability [YLDs]), and disease burden (disability-adjusted 
life-years [DALYs]) for children and adolescents aged 0-24 years. Data were 
reported across the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and across time (1990-2019), 
and for 204 countries and territories. For HIV, we reported the 
mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) as a measure of health system performance.
FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 3·0 million deaths and 30·0 million years of 
healthy life lost to disability (as measured by YLDs), corresponding to 288·4 
million DALYs from communicable diseases among children and adolescents globally 
(57·3% of total communicable disease burden across all ages). Over time, there 
has been a shift in communicable disease burden from young children to older 
children and adolescents (largely driven by the considerable reductions in 
children younger than 5 years and slower progress elsewhere), although children 
younger than 5 years still accounted for most of the communicable disease burden 
in 2019. Disease burden and mortality were predominantly in low-SDI settings, 
with high and high-middle SDI settings also having an appreciable burden of 
communicable disease morbidity (4·0 million YLDs in 2019 alone). Three cause 
groups (enteric infections, lower-respiratory-tract infections, and malaria) 
accounted for 59·8% of the global communicable disease burden in children and 
adolescents, with tuberculosis and HIV both emerging as important causes during 
adolescence. HIV was the only cause for which disease burden increased over 
time, particularly in children and adolescents older than 5 years, and 
especially in females. Excess MIRs for HIV were observed for males aged 15-19 
years in low-SDI settings.
INTERPRETATION: Our analysis supports continued policy focus on enteric 
infections and lower-respiratory-tract infections, with orientation to children 
younger than 5 years in settings of low socioeconomic development. However, 
efforts should also be targeted to other conditions, particularly HIV, given its 
increased burden in older children and adolescents. Older children and 
adolescents also experience a large burden of communicable disease, further 
highlighting the need for efforts to extend beyond the first 5 years of life. 
Our analysis also identified substantial morbidity caused by communicable 
diseases affecting child and adolescent health across the world.

Hong Kong is a well-developed city with outstanding healthcare services, leading 
to the highest life expectancy in the world. Paradoxically, the quality of 
end-of-life care in this city lagged behind that of many other high-income 
regions. Possibly, the advances in medicine contribute to the death denial 
culture, hindering communication about end-of-life care. This paper discusses 
challenges arisen due to poor public awareness and professional training and 
local initiatives to promote advance care planning in the community.

Transport and Golgi organization 2 (TANGO2) disease is a severe inherited 
disorder that presents with multiple symptoms and a broad spectrum of 
phenotypes, including metabolic crisis, encephalopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, and 
hypothyroidism. The clinical picture of a TANGO2 gene biallelic mutation 
involves encephalopathy and rhabdomyolysis and is marked by cardiac rhythm 
disorders and neurological regression. The presentation of encephalopathy varies 
and can range from isolated language delay and cognitive impairment to multiple 
disabilities and spastic quadriparesis. A TANGO2 gene mutation causes serious 
illness with a limited life expectancy due to the unpredictable risk of cardiac 
rhythm disorder and death, particularly during rhabdomyolysis. Clinicians must 
therefore consider the TANGO2 gene when confronted with rhabdomyolysis in a 
patient suffering from an early developmental disorder. Currently, managing this 
disease is purely symptomatic. Here, we report the clinical features of a 
10-year-old girl with mutations in the TANGO2 gene. Unique to our case was the 
lack of elevated creatine kinase during the early acute crises of cardiac 
failure and multi-organ failure, as well as the lack of any prior mental 
retardation associated with the aberrant heart rhythm.

Enough is enough: salvage procedures in severe periprosthetic joint infection.

BACKGROUND: In severe cases of periprosthetic joint infection involving negative 
host-dependent factors, individual-based decisions between a curative therapy 
vs. salvage procedure are necessary. We aimed to review salvage procedures in 
severe periprosthetic joint infection cases, where a gold standard of a curative 
two-stage exchange can no longer be achieved. The options of knee arthrodesis, 
amputation, persistent fistula (stable drainage), or a debridement, antibiotics, 
and implant retention procedure in late-onset cases are discussed, including 
lifelong antibiotic suppression alone.
METHODS: We focused on known salvage procedures for severe periprosthetic joint 
infection of the hip and knee, such as amputation, arthrodesis, antibiotic 
suppression, persistent fistula, and debridement, antibiotics, and implant 
retention in late-stage infections, and the role of local antibiotics. The 
current literature regarding indications and outcomes was reviewed.
RESULTS: Whereas a successful single-stage above-knee amputation can be a 
curative effort in younger patients, this is associated with limited outcome in 
older patients, as the proportion who receive an exoprosthesis leading to 
independent mobility is low. Therefore, arthrodesis using an intramedullary 
modular nail is an option for limb salvage, pain reduction, and preservation of 
quality of life and everyday life mobility, when revision total knee 
arthroplasty is not an option. Carrying out a persistent fistula using a stable 
drainage system, as well as a lifelong antibiotic suppression therapy, can be an 
option, in cases where no other surgery is possible. Active clinical 
surveillance should then be carried out. A debridement, antibiotics, and implant 
retention procedure in combination with local degradable antibiotics can be used 
and is an encouraging new option, but should not been carried out twice.
CONCLUSION: Whereas the gold standard in periprosthetic joint infection 
treatment of late infections remains the exchange of the prosthesis, salvage 
procedures should be considered in the cases of reduced life expectancy, several 
recurrences of the infection, patients having preference and negative host 
factors. In these cases, the appropriate salvage procedure can temporarily lead 
to remission of the infection and the possibility to maintain mobility.

Understanding Vaccination Among Hesitant Adopters of the COVID-19 Vaccine Using 
the Increasing Vaccination Model.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was the third leading cause of death in 2021 
in the United States and has led to historic declines in life expectancy for 
Americans. While vaccination is an effective mitigation strategy for COVID-19, 
vaccine hesitancy remains a major barrier to individual and population-level 
protection. An emerging literature on hesitant adopters of COVID-19 vaccines 
highlights co-occurrence of hesitancy and vaccine uptake as an understudied 
phenomenon, with the potential to provide insight into factors that lead 
hesitant individuals to become vaccinated despite their hesitancy. We use 
qualitative interviews among hesitant adopters in Arkansas to examine vaccine 
hesitancy among this understudied group. Drawing on the Increasing Vaccination 
Model, we find that the most frequently reported motivations of hesitant 
adopters were within the domain of social processes, pointing to a critical 
focal point for targeted health communications intervening in this domain (e.g. 
social norms, social networks, and altruistic behavior). We find that 
recommendations from health care workers (HCWs) other than physicians/providers 
may serve as an effective influence to vaccinate. We also demonstrate negative 
effects of low provider and HCW confidence and weak recommendations on 
motivations to vaccinate among individuals expressing vaccine hesitancy. 
Additionally, we find individual information-seeking behaviors among hesitant 
adopters bolstered confidence in the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on 
these findings, clear, accessible, and authoritative health communication has a 
role in combatting the COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation infodemic.

Experience of grief has increased among people with intellectual disability 
because of their longer life expectancy. Professionals supporting this 
population are often critical of the lack of adequate tools for dealing with 
this situation. The objective of this study was to identify the strategies and 
barriers that these professionals are confronted with when dealing people with 
intellectual disability who are going through the grieving process. A 
qualitative study was conducted involving 20 professionals working with people 
with intellectual disability. Four themes were extracted using thematic 
analysis: Exclusion of clients from end-of-life and grief processes, Strategies 
to support the client's grief process, Emotional and personal difficulties faced 
by the professionals, and Coping and regulation of the professional's grief 
process. Barriers identified by these professionals include not having the 
specific skills to support clients in their grief and the emotional impact of 
the death of a client.

Bacteria of the genus Brucella are facultative intracellular parasites that 
cause brucellosis, a severe animal and human disease. Recently, a group of 
taxonomists merged the brucellae with the primarily free-living, 
phylogenetically related Ochrobactrum spp. in the genus Brucella. This change, 
founded only on global genomic analysis and the fortuitous isolation of some 
opportunistic Ochrobactrum spp. from medically compromised patients, has been 
automatically included in culture collections and databases. We argue that 
clinical and environmental microbiologists should not accept this nomenclature, 
and we advise against its use because (i) it was presented without in-depth 
phylogenetic analyses and did not consider alternative taxonomic solutions; (ii) 
it was launched without the input of experts in brucellosis or Ochrobactrum; 
(iii) it applies a non-consensus genus concept that disregards taxonomically 
relevant differences in structure, physiology, population structure, 
core-pangenome assemblies, genome structure, genomic traits, clinical features, 
treatment, prevention, diagnosis, genus description rules, and, above all, 
pathogenicity; and (iv) placing these two bacterial groups in the same genus 
creates risks for veterinarians, medical doctors, clinical laboratories, health 
authorities, and legislators who deal with brucellosis, a disease that is 
particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries. Based on all this 
information, we urge microbiologists, bacterial collections, genomic databases, 
journals, and public health boards to keep the Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera 
separate to avoid further bewilderment and harm.

The extension of late working life has been proposed as a potential remedy for 
the challenges of aging societies. For Germany, surprisingly little is known 
about trends and social inequalities in the length of late working life. We use 
data from the German Microcensus to estimate working life expectancy from age 55 
onward for the 1941‒1955 birth cohorts. We adjust our calculations of working 
life expectancy for working hours and present results for western and eastern 
Germany by gender, education, and occupation. While working life expectancy has 
increased across cohorts, we find strong regional and socioeconomic disparities. 
Decomposition analyses show that among males, socioeconomic differences are 
predominantly driven by variation in employment rates; among women, variation in 
both employment rates and working hours are highly relevant. Older eastern 
German women have longer working lives than older western German women, which is 
likely attributable to the German Democratic Republic legacy of high female 
employment.

The increase in life expectancy of the world population has led to a concomitant 
increase in the prevalence of multiple myeloma (MM), a disease that usually 
affects the elderly population. Bone lesions are frequent in patients with this 
condition, demanding an early approach, from drug treatment, through 
radiotherapy to orthopedic surgery (prophylactic or therapeutic) with the 
objective of preventing or delaying the occurrence of fracture, or, when this 
event has already occurred, treat it through stabilization or replacement 
(lesions located in the appendicular skeleton) and/or promote stabilization and 
spinal cord decompression (lesions located in the axial skeleton), providing 
rapid pain relief, return to ambulation and resocialization, returning quality 
of life to patients. The aim of this review is to update the reader on the 
findings of pathophysiology, clinical, laboratory and imaging, differential 
diagnosis and therapeutic approach of multiple myeloma bone disease (MMBD).
