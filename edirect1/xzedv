The worldwide prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been constantly 
increasing in the last decades. With rising life expectancy, a longer disease 
duration in PD patients is observed, further increasing the need and 
socioeconomic importance of adequate PD treatment. Today, PD is exclusively 
treated symptomatically, mainly by dopaminergic stimulation, while efforts to 
modify disease progression could not yet be translated to the clinics. New 
formulations of approved drugs and treatment options of motor fluctuations in 
advanced stages accompanied by telehealth monitoring have improved PD patients 
care. In addition, continuous improvement in the understanding of PD disease 
mechanisms resulted in the identification of new pharmacological targets. 
Applying novel trial designs, targeting of pre-symptomatic disease stages, and 
the acknowledgment of PD heterogeneity raise hopes to overcome past failures in 
the development of drugs for disease modification. In this review, we address 
these recent developments and venture a glimpse into the future of PD therapy in 
the years to come.

IMPORTANCE: Both the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer are increasing 
worldwide. Updated evaluations of prostate cancer burden and its global, 
regional and national patterns are essential for formulating effective 
preventive strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 1990 and 2019 to facilitate 
preventive measures and control planning.
METHODS: Annual incident cases, deaths, DALYs, age-standardized incidence rates 
(ASIRs), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), and age-standardized DALYs 
rates (ASDRs) of prostate cancer between 1990 and 2019 were derived from the 
Global Burden of Diseases study 2019. Percentage changes in incident cases, 
deaths and DALYs and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) in ASIRs, ASMRs 
and ASDRs were calculated to quantify temporal trends. Correlations between 
EAPCs and socio-demographic index (SDI) and universal health coverage index 
(UHCI) were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses.
RESULTS: Globally, the number of incident cases, deaths, and DALYs of prostate 
cancer increased by 116.11%, 108.94%, and 98.25% from 1990 to 2019, 
respectively. The ASIR increased by an average of 0.26% (95% CI: 0.14%, 0.37%) 
per year between 1990 and 2019, while the ASMR and ASDR decreased by an average 
of - 0.75% (95% CI: - 0.84%, - 0.67%) and - 0.71% (95% CI: - 0.78%, - 0.63%) per 
year in this period, respectively. Epidemic trends in the burdens of prostate 
cancer were not uniform throughout different groups of SDI or geography. The 
burdens of prostate cancer varied across SDI regions, with an increasing trend 
in ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR in low and low-middle SDI regions between 1990 and 2019. 
A significant positive correlation between the EAPC in ASIR and UHCI was 
observed in countries with a UHCI < 70 (ρ = 0.37, p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Prostate cancer remains a major global health burden due to the 
increase in incident cases, deaths, and DALYs in the past three decades. These 
increases are likely to continue as the population ages, which indicates a 
potential talent gap in the trained healthcare workforce. The diversity of 
prostate cancer development models implies the importance of specific local 
strategies tailored for each country's risk factor profile. Prevention, early 
detection and more effective treatment strategies for prostate cancer are 
essential.

BACKGROUND: In many organisms increased reproductive effort is associated with a 
shortened life span. This trade-off is reflected in conserved molecular pathways 
that link nutrient-sensing with fecundity and longevity. Social insect queens 
apparently defy the fecundity / longevity trade-off as they are both, extremely 
long-lived and highly fecund. Here, we have examined the effects of a 
protein-enriched diet on these life-history traits and on tissue-specific gene 
expression in a termite species of low social complexity.
RESULTS: On a colony level, we did not observe reduced lifespan and increased 
fecundity, effects typically seen in solitary model organisms, after protein 
enrichment. Instead, on the individual level mortality was reduced in queens 
that consumed more of the protein-enriched diet - and partially also in workers 
- while fecundity seemed unaffected. Our transcriptome analyses supported our 
life-history results. Consistent with life span extension, the expression of IIS 
(insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling) components was reduced in fat 
bodies after protein enrichment. Interestingly, however, genes involved in 
reproductive physiology (e.g., vitellogenin) were largely unaffected in fat body 
and head transcriptomes.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IIS is decoupled from downstream 
fecundity-associated pathways, which can contribute to the remoulding of the 
fecundity/longevity trade-off in termites as compared to solitary insects.

A critical re-evaluation of Mohs micrographic surgery for a facial basal cell 
carcinoma in older adults: Should we waive this treatment in certain patients?

BACKGROUND: Skin cancer incidences are increasing. Treatment for basal cell 
carcinomas (BCCs) can be questioned in certain patients. Treatment options are 
various, but Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has the highest cure rate. It is, 
however, time-consuming and results in high logistical burden and treatment 
costs for both patients and society.
OBJECTIVES: This study critically re-evaluates MMS for facial BCCs in older 
adults. The main objective is to examine all clinical, tumour and patient 
characteristics in relation to safety and survival to detect a subgroup in which 
MMS was not the best choice. The overall aim is to identify characteristics that 
support clinical decision-making in daily practice.
METHODS: Patients that received MMS between November 1998 and December 2012 were 
included. Only patients >75 years with a facial BCC were withheld for analysis. 
This is a retrospective cohort study, since evaluating the outcome of MMS in 
accordance with life expectancy is the main objective. Patient charts were 
evaluated towards comorbidities, complications and survival.
RESULTS: This cohort comprises 207 patients. Median survival was 7.85 years. The 
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (aCCI) was divided into low/medium 
scores (aCCI < 6) and high scores (aCCI ≥ 6). Median survival was 11.58 years in 
the low aCCI group and 3.60 years in the high aCCI group (p < 0.001). There was 
a very strong association between high aCCI and survival (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 
3.83-10.21). Other characteristics were not associated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should assess the aCCI in older patients presenting with 
a facial BCC before deciding if MMS is an eligible treatment option. High aCCI 
has shown to be an indicator for low median survival, even in MMS patients with 
usually high functional status. MMS should be waived as treatment in older 
patients with high aCCI scores in favour of other, less intensive and less 
expensive treatment options.

BACKGROUND: Tooth wear (TW) prevalence is high and increasing and has important 
consequences on the patient's quality of life. Knowledge of risk factors is 
crucial to promote diagnosis, prevention strategies and timely interceptive 
treatment. Many studies have identified TW risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to map and describe suspected available 
factors associated with TW in permanent dentition based on quantitative 
measurement.
METHODS: The scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA extension of the 
Scoping Reviews checklist. The search was conducted in October 2022 from the 
Medline® (PubMed® interface) and Scopus® databases. Two independent reviewers 
selected and characterised the studies.
RESULTS: 2702 articles were identified for assessment of titles and abstracts, 
and 273 articles were included in the review. The results show a need to 
standardise TW measurement indices and the study design. The included studies 
highlighted various factors, classified into nine domains: sociodemographic 
factors, medical history, drinking habits, eating habits, oral hygiene habits, 
dental factors, bruxism and temporomandibular disorders, behavioural factors, 
and stress. Results related to chemical TW (erosion) risk factors underline the 
importance of eating disorders, gastroesophageal reflux and lifestyle, 
particularly drinking and eating behaviours, which supports developing public 
health information campaigns and interventions. Besides chemical, this review 
identifies evidence of several mechanical TW risk factors, such as toothbrushing 
and bruxism; the influence of this last factor needs to be further explored.
CONCLUSIONS: TW management and prevention require a multidisciplinary approach. 
Dentists are in the first line to detect associated diseases such as reflux or 
eating disorders. Consequently, practitioners' information and guideline 
diffusion should be promoted, and a TW risk factors checklist (the ToWeR 
checklist) is proposed to help diagnostic approaches.

The unexpected effect of the combination of lapatinib and capecitabin in cranial 
metastasis.

Gulmez A(1).

Cranial metastasis (CM) is a serious problem in breast cancer patients. In 
patients with CM, quality of life is adversely affected and the survival of 
patients is reduced. It is also very difficult to manage breast cancer patients 
with cranial metastases whose life expectancy is generally 1 year or less. There 
is no case report in the literature of CM with more than 5 years of 
progression-free survival (PFS) with oncological treatment. I presented a rare 
case about the widespread CM developed with tamoxifen treatment in an advanced 
breast cancer patient who completed chemotherapy and radiotherapy after primary 
surgery. Systemic treatment was started as a combination of capecitabine and 
lapatinib after whole-brain radiotherapy was applied to the patient with 
extensive CM. At the end of about 3 years, there is complete response of cranial 
metastases, and PFS is over 5 years. The treatment was well tolerated, and she 
is still being followed up in the 74th month of this treatment without 
recurrence. There are no case reports of HER-2-positive breast cancer patients 
with such widespread cranial metastases in complete remission at 34 months of 
systemic therapy and 74 months of PFS. Our article is unique in this respect. It 
should be kept in mind that it is not appropriate to change the treatment plan 
of patients with only one case report. Although the options have increased with 
the use of new generation antihuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
treatments, lapatinib can be a very effective treatment tool in selected 
patients.

AIM: Lung cancer has opened a new era in cancer treatment by elucidating the 
tumor's molecular structure and identifying the targetable mutations. 
Identifying the targeted mutations in lung cancer constitutes one of the main 
steps of treatment planning. The frequency of EGFR (epidermal growth factor 
receptor gene) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene) mutations in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) also varies in populations depending on ethnicity, 
gender, smoking, and histopathological subtype. In general, limited data are 
available regarding the frequency and regional distribution of these mutations 
in the Turkish population. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of EGFR 
and ALK mutations in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC and compare the clinical 
characteristics, treatment, and survival results of cases with mutations with 
the group without mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, 593 patients with advanced-stage NSCLC 
diagnosis and mutational analyses were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic 
characteristics, tumor stages (tumor, node, metastasis, TNM), EGFR and ALK 
analysis results, treatments applied, and survival of the cases were recorded. 
EGFR analysis, exon 18, 19, 20, and 21 mutations were studied with real-time PCR 
(RT-PCR) Rotor-Gene system from patients' samples. For ALK analysis, the ALK 
Break Apart kit (Zytovision GmbH; Germany) was used with the fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH) method.
RESULTS: In our study, EGFR mutation was detected in 63 patients (10.6%) and ALK 
mutation in 19 patients (3.2%) out of 593 patients. EGFR mutation was observed 
more frequently in women and non-smokers (P = 0.001, P = 0.003). No correlation 
was found between the presence of EGFR mutation and metastases regions and 
recurrence (P > 0.05). ALK mutation was observed more frequently in non-smokers 
and females (P = 0.001, P = 0.003). Patients with ALK mutations were younger 
than other groups (P = 0.003). There was also no significant relationship 
between ALK mutation and metastates regions and recurrence after treatment (P > 
0.05). Patients with EGFR or ALK mutations had a longer life span than other 
cases (P = 0.474). Those who had ALK mutations and received targeted therapy had 
a longer average life expectancy (P < 0.05). No difference was observed in those 
who had EGFR mutations and received targeted treatment in terms of survival (P > 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: In our study, conducted in the Aegean region of Turkey, the 
positivity rates of EGFR and ALK mutations were found to be at similar rates 
with the Caucasian race across the world. EGFR mutation was more common in 
women, non-smokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma histology. ALK mutation was 
also detected more frequently in younger patients, women, and non-smokers. 
Patients with EGFR and ALK mutations had a longer life expectancy than those 
without the mutation. It was observed that testing patients diagnosed with 
advanced-stage NSCLC for genetic mutations of the tumor in the first step of the 
treatment and initiating treatment in patients with mutations provided a 
significant survival advantage.

BACKGROUND: Bexagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. 
A pilot study has shown that bexagliflozin can decrease dependence on exogenous 
insulin in cats with diabetes mellitus (DM).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bexagliflozin as a 
monotherapy for DM in previously untreated cats.
ANIMALS: Eighty-four client-owned cats.
METHODS: Historically controlled prospective open-label clinical trial. Cats 
were dosed PO with 15 mg bexagliflozin once daily for 56 days, with a 124-day 
extension to evaluate safety and treatment effect durability. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of cats experiencing a decrease in hyperglycemia and 
improvement in clinical signs of hyperglycemia from baseline on day 56.
RESULTS: Of 84 enrolled cats, 81 were evaluable on day 56, and 68 (84.0%) were 
treatment successes. Decreases in mean serum glucose, fructosamine, and 
β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) concentrations were observed, and investigator 
assessments of cat neurological status, musculature, and hair coat quality 
improved. Owner evaluations of both cat and owner quality of life were 
favorable. The fructosamine half-life in diabetic cats was found to be 6.8 days. 
Commonly observed adverse events included emesis, diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, 
and dehydration. Eight cats experienced serious adverse events, 3 of which led 
to death or euthanasia. The most important adverse event was euglycemic diabetic 
ketoacidosis, diagnosed in 3 cats and presumed present in a fourth.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Bexagliflozin decreased hyperglycemia and 
observed clinical signs in cats newly diagnosed with DM. As a once-daily PO 
medication, bexagliflozin may simplify management of DM in cats.

Life expectancy in the United States is decreasing. Health disparities are 
widening. Growing evidence for and integration of social and structural 
determinants into theory and practice has not yet improved outcomes. The 
COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the fact. In this paper, we argue that the 
biomedical model and its underlying scientific paradigm of causal determinism, 
which currently dominate population health, cannot meet population health needs. 
While criticism of the biomedical model is not new, this paper advances the 
field by going beyond criticism to recognize the need for a paradigm shift. In 
the first half of the paper, we present a critical analysis of the biomedical 
model and the paradigm of causal determinism. In the second half, we outline the 
agentic paradigm and present a structural model of health based on 
generalizable, group-level processes. We use the experience of the COVID-19 
pandemic to illustrate the practical applications of our model. It will be 
important for future work to investigate the empirical and pragmatic 
applications of our structural model of population health.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of rheumatic heart 
disease (RHD) and its trends in different countries, regions, genders and age 
groups globally.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. 
Age-standardized rates (ASRs) and the estimated annual percentage changes 
(EAPCs) in the ASRs were used to describe the burden of disease and its trends. 
Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between 
sociodemographic index (SDI) values and the observed trends.
RESULTS: In 2019, the ASRs of the incidence, prevalence, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of RHD were 37.39/105 (95%UI, 28.59/105 
to 46.74/105), 513.68/105 (95%UI, 405.01/105 to 636.25/105), 3.85/105 (95%UI, 
4.29/105 to 3.29/105) and 132.88/105 (95%UI, 115.02/105 to 150.34/105), 
respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and prevalence of RHD showed 
upward trends and the mortality and DALYs showed downward trends. Countries or 
regions in Africa, South America and South Asia had a greater burden of RHD. The 
burden of RHD was greater in women, where as men showed more obvious increasing 
trends in the incidence and prevalence. The incidence of RHD was highest in 
adolescents, and the prevalence was highest in young and middle-aged. The 
mortality and DALYs rate associated with RHD increased with age. The EAPCs in 
the ASRs were negatively correlated with the SDI value.
CONCLUSION: Although the ASRs of mortality and DALYs attributable to RHD are 
decreasing globally, RHD remains an important public health problem that needs 
to be addressed urgently, especially in certain low- and middle-income countries 
and regions.

An 'oasis' signifies a refugium of safety, recovery, relaxation, fertility, and 
productivity in an inhospitable desert, a sweet spot in a barren landscape where 
life-giving water spills forth from the Earth. Remarkable mythological 
congruencies exist across dryland cultures worldwide where oases or 'arid-land 
springs' occur. In many places they also provide specialised habitats for an 
extraordinary array of endemic organisms. To inform their management, and 
maintain their integrity, it is essential to understand the hydrogeology of 
aquifers and springs. Gravity-fed vs artesian aquifers; actively recharged vs 
fossil aquifers, and sources of geothermal activity are important concepts 
presented here. There consequences for oases of sustainable and unsustainable 
groundwater extraction, and other examples of effective conservation management. 
Oases are archetypes for human consciousness, habitats that deserve protection 
and conservation, and a lingua franca for multicultural values and scientific 
exchange. We represent an international Fellowship of the Spring seeking to 
encompass and facilitate the stewardship of oases and aquifers through improved 
knowledge, outreach, and governance.

BACKGROUND: Point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid testing for diagnosis of HIV in 
infants facilitates earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) than with 
centralised (standard-of-care, SOC) testing, but can be more expensive. We 
evaluated cost-effectiveness data from mathematical models comparing POC with 
SOC to provide global policy guidance.
METHODS: In this systematic review of modelling studies, we searched PubMed, 
MEDLINE, Embase, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, 
Econlit, and conference abstracts, combining terms for "HIV" + "infant"/"early 
infant diagnosis" + "point-of-care" + "cost-effectiveness" + "mathematical 
models", without restrictions from database inception to July 15, 2022. We 
selected reports of mathematical cost-effectiveness models comparing POC with 
SOC for HIV diagnosis in infants younger than 18 months. Titles and abstracts 
were independently reviewed, with full-text review for qualifying articles. We 
extracted data on health and economic outcomes and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for narrative synthesis. The primary outcomes 
of interest were ICERs (comparing POC with SOC) for ART initiation and survival 
of children living with HIV.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 75 records through database search. 13 
duplicates were excluded, leaving 62 non-duplicate articles. 57 records were 
excluded and five were reviewed in full text. One article was excluded as it was 
not a modelling study, and four qualifying studies were included in the review. 
These four reports were from two mathematical models from two independent 
modelling groups. Two reports used the Johns Hopkins model to compare POC with 
SOC for repeat early infant diagnosis testing in the first 6 months in 
sub-Saharan Africa (first report, simulation of 25 000 children) and Zambia 
(second report, simulation of 7500 children). In the base scenario, POC versus 
SOC increased probability of ART initiation within 60 days of testing from 19% 
to 82% (ICER per additional ART initiation range US$430-1097; 9-month cost 
horizon) in the first report; and from 28% to 81% in the second ($23-1609, 
5-year cost horizon). Two reports compared POC with SOC for testing at 6 weeks 
in Zimbabwe using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS 
Complications-Paediatric model (simulation of 30 million children; lifetime 
horizon). POC increased life expectancy and was considered cost-effective 
compared with SOC (ICER $711-850 per year of life saved in HIV-exposed 
children). Results were robust throughout sensitivity and scenario analyses. In 
most scenarios, platform cost-sharing (co-use with other programmes) resulted in 
POC being cost-saving compared with SOC.
INTERPRETATION: Four reports from two different models suggest that POC is a 
cost-effective and potentially cost-saving strategy for upscaling of early 
infant testing compared with SOC.

OBJECTIVES: While active surveillance, a form of expectant management (EM), is 
preferred for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), some favor a more 
risk-adapted approach that recognizes patient preferences and condition-specific 
factors. However, previous research has shown non-patient-related factors often 
drive PCa treatment. In this context, we characterized trends in AS with respect 
to disease risk and health status.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified men 66 years and 
older diagnosed with localized low- and intermediate-risk PCa from 2008 to 2017 
and examined receipt of EM, defined as the absence of treatment (i.e., surgery, 
cryotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapies) within 
1 year of diagnosis. We performed bivariable analysis to compare trends in use 
for EM vs. treatment, stratified by disease risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3, 3+4, 4+3; 
PSA<10, 10-20) and health status (i.e., NCI Comorbidity Index (NCI), frailty, 
life expectancy). We then ran a multivariable logistic regression model to 
examine determinants of EM.
RESULTS: Within this cohort, 26,364 (38%) were categorized as low-risk (i.e., 
Gleason 3+3 and PSA<10) and 43,520 (62%) as intermediate-risk (i.e., all 
others). Over the study period, use of EM significantly increased across all 
risk groups, except for Gleason 4+3 (P = 0.662), as well across all health 
status groups. However, linear trends did not differ significantly between frail 
vs. nonfrail patients for both those categorized as low-risk (P = 0.446) and 
intermediate-risk (P = 0.208). Trends also did not differ between NCI 0 vs. 1 
vs. >1 for low-risk PCa (P = 0.395). In the multivariable models, EM was 
associated with increasing age and being frail for men with both low- and 
intermediate risk disease. Conversely, EM selection was negatively associated 
with higher comorbidity score.
CONCLUSIONS: EM increased significantly over time for patients with low- and 
favorable intermediate-risk disease, with the most notable differences based on 
age and Gleason score. In contrast, trends in uptake of EM did not differ 
substantively by health status, suggesting that physicians may not be 
effectively incorporating patient health into PCa treatment decisions. 
Additional work is needed to develop interventions that recognize health status 
as an essential component of a risk-adapted approach.

BACKGROUND: The aging of the population and the progressive increase of life 
expectancy in developed countries is leading to a high incidence of age-related 
cerebrovascular diseases, which affect people's motor and cognitive capabilities 
and might result in the loss of arm and hand functions. Such conditions have a 
detrimental impact on people's quality of life. Assistive robots have been 
developed to help people with motor or cognitive disabilities to perform 
activities of daily living (ADLs) independently. Most of the robotic systems for 
assisting on ADLs proposed in the state of the art are mainly external 
manipulators and exoskeletal devices. The main objective of this study is to 
compare the performance of an hybrid EEG/EOG interface to perform ADLs when the 
user is controlling an exoskeleton rather than using an external manipulator.
METHODS: Ten impaired participants (5 males and 5 females, mean age 52 ± 16 
years) were instructed to use both systems to perform a drinking task and a 
pouring task comprising multiple subtasks. For each device, two modes of 
operation were studied: synchronous mode (the user received a visual cue 
indicating the sub-tasks to be performed at each time) and asynchronous mode 
(the user started and finished each of the sub-tasks independently). Fluent 
control was assumed when the time for successful initializations ranged below 
3 s and a reliable control in case it remained below 5 s. NASA-TLX questionnaire 
was used to evaluate the task workload. For the trials involving the use of the 
exoskeleton, a custom Likert-Scale questionnaire was used to evaluate the user's 
experience in terms of perceived comfort, safety, and reliability.
RESULTS: All participants were able to control both systems fluently and 
reliably. However, results suggest better performances of the exoskeleton over 
the external manipulator (75% successful initializations remain below 3 s in 
case of the exoskeleton and bellow 5s in case of the external manipulator).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of our study in terms of fluency and 
reliability of EEG control suggest better performances of the exoskeleton over 
the external manipulator, such results cannot be considered conclusive, due to 
the heterogeneity of the population under test and the relatively limited number 
of participants.

Hyponatremia is a very common abnormality in palliative care which can cause a 
sudden decline in the patient's general condition. The diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures are based on the patient's symptoms and life-expectancy. 
The inadequate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions result in an unnecessary 
burden, while the adequate treatment could improve the quality of life. In 
palliative care, acute hyponatremia is very rare, the chronic form without any 
symptoms or mild complaints is more common. Asymptomatic patients should be 
observed. In patients with mild symptoms and months or years plus prognosis 
contributing factors should be discontinued. The electrolyte abnormality of 
patients with moderate or severe symptoms and at least weeks prognosis should be 
treated. Patients with day prognosis needs no treatment. This case report of an 
early palliative care patient with moderate symptoms caused by chronic, severe 
hyponatremia aims to give a suggestion for the management of the most common 
electrolyte abnormality in everyday palliative care. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(18):

BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that stroke is the second leading cause of death 
globally, a comprehensive and comparable assessment of mortality, and 
epidemiologic trends has not been conducted for most regions.We estimated the 
global and regional burden of stroke from 1990 to 2019 using data from the 2019 
Global Study of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors.
METHODS: For the period between 1990 and 2019, we used an age-period-cohort 
model to calculate the annual percentage changes in mortality (net drifts), 
local drifts, and period and cohort relative risks (period/cohort effects). 
Meanwhile, to quantify the temporal trends in stroke age-standardised mortality 
rate (ASMR), Average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) were determined by sex, 
area. With the potential to uncover disparities and treatment gaps in stroke 
care, this approach enables the examination and differentiation of age, period, 
and cohort effects in mortality trends.
FINDINGS: Global stroke deaths in 2019 were 6,552,725 (95% UI 5,995,200 to 
7,015,139). Between 1990 and 2019, the ASMR declined globally by 36.43% (95% UI 
-41.65 to -31.2), with decreases in all SDI quintiles. The net drift in stroke 
mortality from 1990 to 2019 varied from -2.83% per year (95% confidence interval 
[CI]:-3.39 to -2.77) in countries with a high Socio-demographic Index (SDI) to 
-1.21% per year (95% CI: -1.26 to -1.16) in countries with a low SDI. During the 
past 30 years, favorable mortality reductions were generally found in high-SDI 
countries (net drift = -3.1% [95% CI: -3.4 to -2.8] per year) and high-middle 
SDI countries (-2.8% [-3.0 to -2.6]). However, 31 of 204 countries had either 
increasing trends (net drifts≥0.0%) or stagnated reductions (≥ - 0.5%) in 
mortality. The relative risk of mortality generally showed improving trends over 
time and in successively younger birth cohorts among high and high-middle SDI 
countries, with the exceptions of Kuwait, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Guam, 
RussianFederation, Lithuania, Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovin, 
and Bulgaria.
INTERPRETATION: Notwithstanding mortality from stroke has increased globally 
over the past 30 years, adverse period and cohort effects have been found in 
many countries, calling into question the adequacy of healthcare for stroke 
patients of all ages. These lapses have a significant impact on the likelihood 
of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets on mortality from 
age 60+ and NCDs.
