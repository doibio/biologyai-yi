Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) are an accelerating global health problem as life 
expectancy rises worldwide. Despite their significant burden in public health 
systems to date, the existing treatments only manage the symptoms without 
slowing down disease progression. Thus, the ongoing neurodegenerative process 
remains untreated. Moreover, the stronghold of the brain-the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB)-prevents drug penetrance and dwindles effective treatments. In the last 
years, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (DDS) have become a promising 
approach to target and treat these disorders related to the central nervous 
system (CNS). PLGA based nanoparticles (NPs) were the first employed DDS for 
effective drug delivery. However, the poor drug loading capacity and localized 
immunogenicity prompted the scientific community to move to another DDS such as 
lipid-based NPs. Despite the lipid NPs' safety and effectiveness, their 
off-target accumulation together with the denominated CARPA (complement 
activation-related pseudo allergy) reaction has limited their complete clinical 
translation. Recently, biological NPs naturally secreted by cells, termed as 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising more complex 
biocompatible DDS. In addition, EVs act as dual players in NDs treatment, as a 
"cell free" therapy themselves, as well as new biological NPs with numerous 
characteristics that qualify them as promising carriers over synthetic DDS. The 
present review aims to display advantages, drawbacks, current limitations and 
future prospective of the previously cited synthetic and biological DDS to enter 
the brain and treat one of 21st century most challenging diseases, NDs. This 
article is categorized under: Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > 
Nanomedicine for Neurological Disease.

Social vulnerabilities affect life expectancy across North Carolina. From 2018 
to 2020, we observed that counties with low life expectancy had higher Social 
Vulnerability Index (SVI) scores. Counties with low SVI scores had higher life 
expectancy compared to sister counties with higher SVI scores.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related mortality and morbidity are on the 
rise, and significant racial and ethnic disparities persist. To reverse these 
trends, an expanded focus on addressing the root causes of CVD and improving 
health equity is needed. While barriers and challenges are inevitable, numerous 
successes and opportunities inspire hope for reversing these trends.

Economics, Bengbu, Anhui Province, China.

BACKGROUND: With the prolongation of the life expectancy of the Chinese 
population and the intensification of the aging process of the population, the 
mental health problems of the elderly have become increasingly prominent. This 
study aims to explore whether self-employment can promote and how to promote the 
mental health of the elderly.
METHOD: Based on the 2018 China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS) data, 
this paper uses OLS model and KHB method to verify the impact of self-employment 
on the mental health of the younger elderly and its mechanism.
RESULTS: The results indicate that self-employment can significantly reduce the 
depression tendency of the younger elderly and promote their mental health. 
Heterogeneity analysis shows that self-employment has a more significant 
positive impact on the mental health of the younger elderly who are self-rated 
healthy, free of chronic diseases and low-level medical service utilization. The 
mechanism shows that self-employment can indirectly improve the mental health of 
the younger elderly through income growth effect and self-worth realization 
effect, in which the self-worth realization effect is greater than the economic 
effect. It illustrates that with the development of China's economy, the elderly 
are pursuing more intrinsic values brought by self-employment than economic 
benefits.
CONCLUSION: In view of the above research results, it is suggested to encourage 
the elderly to actively participate in social activities, provide policy support 
for the younger elderly to engage in self-employment, increase government 
support as well as health guarantee level, and improve the subjective initiative 
of the elderly to participate in self-employment, so that the society can truly 
realize the healthy aging of "being useful and productive for the elderly".

BACKGROUND: The growing population of older adults worldwide is associated with 
an extended life expectancy and an increasing proportion of older adults with 
dynapenia. Most research on dynapenia has involved only populations of older 
adults living in the community; little research has examined the effects of risk 
factors on sleep quality among older adults with dynapenia residing in assisted 
living facilities.
AIM: This study examined the relationships among physical function, nutrition, 
cognitive function, depression, and sleep quality among older adults with 
dynapenia residing in assisted living facilities.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data on physical function, nutrition, 
cognitive function, depression, and sleep quality was collected from 178 older 
adults with dynapenia residing in assisted living facilities, who were selected 
using purposive sampling. Descriptive statistical analysis, independent-sample t 
tests, chi-squared tests, and logistic regression analysis were performed using 
SPSS 25.0.
RESULTS: The statistical analyses revealed correlations between sleep quality 
and age (t = 2.37, p < 0.05), level of education (χ2 = 3.85, p < 0.05), grip 
strength (t = 3.40, p < 0.01), activities of daily living (t = 4.29, p < 0.001), 
instrumental activities of daily living (t = 2.23, p < 0.001), calf 
circumference (t = 2.89, p < 0.01), Mini Nutritional Assessment scores 
(t = 2.29, p < 0.05), Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores (t = 4.50, 
p < 0.001), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores (t = - 4.20, p < 0.001). 
Calf circumference (OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.650.97, p < 0.05), GDS score 
(OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.05-1.92, p < 0.05), and MMSE score (OR = 0.85, 95% 
CI = 0.73-0.97, p < 0.05) were related to sleep quality among the sample 
population.
CONCLUSION: Physical function, nutrition, cognitive function, and depression 
affect the sleep quality of older adults with dynapenia residing in assisted 
living facilities. Facility nurses must regularly assess these aspects of their 
patients to ensure that facility-dwelling older adults can maintain their 
physical function and improve their health to improve the quality of their 
sleep.

BACKGROUND: Infection prevention and control (IPC) is an evidence-based and 
practical approach to prevention of harm by infection (Infection prevention and 
control 
https://www.who.int/health-topics/infection-prevention-and-control#tab=tab_1 ). 
IPC recommendations targeted at community-acquired infection aim to prevent 
illness and subsequent hospital readmission. Cohesive guidance for parents of 
preterm infants has not been clearly established. The review objectives are to 
identify and map the global characteristics of IPC measures/recommendations for 
parents of preterm infants discharged home to the community.
METHODS: The scoping review will be conducted using the JBI methodological 
approach for scoping reviews and reported following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Review extension (PRISMA 
ScR) and the PRISMA extension for reporting literature searches in systematic 
reviews. Electronic databases will be searched and limited by publication year 
(2013-present day). Grey literature, reference lists and expert-provided sources 
will be searched against predetermined criteria. A minimum of two authors will 
independently screen evidence sources and chart evidence on a predetermined 
charting form. Sources including IPC measures, or recommendations for parents of 
preterm infants during discharge planning or in the community/home, will be 
permitted within inclusion criteria. Limits include human studies only and 
evidence from 2013-present day. Recommendations aimed at professional 
implementation will be excluded. A descriptive summary of findings will be 
presented, with diagrammatic and tabular representation.
DISCUSSION: Collated evidence will guide future research which will subsequently 
aim to develop policy and enhance clinical approaches.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease that results in the 
destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. The incidence and 
prevalence of T1DM are increasing, making this one of the most common diseases 
of childhood. The disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
with patients experiencing reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy 
compared with the general population. Patients become dependent on exogenous 
insulin which has been the primary treatment since its first clinical use over 
100 years ago. Although there have been advancements in glucose monitoring 
technology and insulin delivery devices, most patients fail to meet glycemic 
targets. Research has therefore focused on different treatment options to delay 
or prevent disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies have previously been 
utilized to suppress the immune response following an organ transplant and were 
subsequently studied for their ability to treat autoimmune diseases. Teplizumab, 
a monoclonal antibody (manufactured by Provention Bio and marketed as Tzield), 
was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first 
preventative treatment for T1DM. The approval came after a 3-decade history of 
research and development. This article provides an overview of the discovery and 
mechanism of action of teplizumab, as well as the clinical trials that led to 
its approval.

BACKGROUND: Discordance between physicians' and patients' prognostic perceptions 
in advanced cancer care threatens informed medical decision-making and 
end-of-life preparation, yet this phenomenon is poorly understood. We sought to: 
(1) describe the extent and direction of prognostic discordance, patients' 
prognostic information preferences in cases of prognostic discordance, and 
physicians' awareness of prognostic discordance; and (2) examine which patient, 
physician, and caregiver factors predict prognostic discordance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oncologists and advanced cancer patients (median survival 
≤12 months; n = 515) from 7 Dutch hospitals completed structured surveys in a 
cross-sectional study. Prognostic discordance was operationalized by comparing 
physicians' and patients' perceptions of the likelihood of cure, 2-year 
mortality risk, and 1-year mortality risk.
RESULTS: Prognostic discordance occurred in 20% (likelihood of cure), 24%, and 
35% (2-year and 1-year mortality risk) of physician-patient dyads, most often 
involving patients with more optimistic perceptions than their physician. Among 
patients demonstrating prognostic discordance, the proportion who preferred not 
knowing prognosis varied from 7% (likelihood of cure) to 37% (1-year mortality 
risk), and 45% (2-year mortality risk). Agreement between physician-perceived 
and observed prognostic discordance or concordance was poor (kappa = 0.186). 
Prognostic discordance was associated with several patient factors (stronger 
fighting spirit, self-reported absence of prognostic discussions, an information 
source other than the healthcare provider), and greater physician-reported 
uncertainty about prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Up to one-third of the patients perceive prognosis discordantly from 
their physician, among whom a substantial proportion prefers not knowing 
prognosis. Most physicians lack awareness of prognostic discordance, raising the 
need to explore patients' prognostic information preferences and perceptions, 
and to tailor prognostic communication.

BACKGROUND: Early rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial 
in functional outcomes. However, considering improvements in the first six 
months, there may be benefits to continuing rehabilitation beyond three months 
postoperatively to achieve maximum functionality and strength.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare: (a) effectiveness of late-phase clinic-based 
and home-based progressive resistance training (PRT) in female patients with 
TKA; and (b) crude cost of both interventions and explore feasibility.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients were assigned to clinic-based PRT (n = 16) and 
home-based PRT (n = 16) groups. A training program was performed at the clinic 
or at home for eight weeks. Pain, quadriceps and hip abductor strength, 
patient-reported and performance-based outcomes, knee range of motion (ROM), 
joint awareness, quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline (three months 
postoperatively) and after 8-week intervention (five months postoperatively). 
Feasibility and crude cost were examined.
RESULTS: Exercise adherence was 100% in clinic-based PRT and 90.6% in the 
home-based PRT group. Both interventions improved quadriceps and hip abductor 
muscle strength, performance-based and patient-reported outcomes, knee ROM, and 
joint awareness without side effects (p < .05). Clinic-based PRT showed better 
results in: activity pain (p = .004, ES = -0.888); knee flexion (p = .002, 
ES = 0.875) and extension ROM (p = .004, ES = -1.081); chair sit-to-stand test 
(p = .013, ES = 0.935); joint awareness (p = .008, ES = 0.927); and QoL than 
home-based PRT (p < .05).
CONCLUSION: Late-phase clinical-based and home-based PRT interventions may be 
beneficial in improving muscle strength and functionality in patients with TKA. 
Late-phase PRT is feasible, cost-effective, and recommended for rehabilitation 
after TKA.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is one of the key indicators for investigating the 
overall health status of a population. Thus, analyzing the trend of this 
demographic measure is of great importance for planning health and social 
services in different societies. In this study, we aimed to model the trends of 
life expectancy in Asia, regions of Asia, and Iran over the past six decades.
METHODS: The annual life expectancy at birth data sets were extracted for Iran 
and the total Asia population between 1960 and 2020 from the database provided 
by the Our World in Data website. The trend analysis was performed using the 
joinpoint regression model.
RESULTS: During the study period, Iranians and Asians have, respectively, 
experienced about 32 and 28.6 years increase in life expectancy. The results 
from joinpoint regression showed that the average annual percent change (AAPC) 
of life expectancy was positive for all regions of Asia, and ranged from 0.4% 
for Central Asia to 0.9% for Southern Asia. In addition, the estimated AAPC in 
Iranian people was about 0.1 higher than the total Asian population (0.9% vs. 
0.8%).
CONCLUSION: Despite protracted wars, poverty, and social inequality in some 
parts of Asia, life expectancy has drastically increased in this continent over 
the last decades. However, life expectancy in Asia (and Iran) is still 
remarkably lower than in more developed parts of the world. To elevate life 
expectancy to a higher level, the policymakers in Asian countries should put 
more effort into improving the standards of living and access to health 
facilities in their societies.

BACKGROUND: Annually, over 131000 new cases of cancer have been identified in 
Iran, with an increasing trend that is predicted to grow by 40% by 2025. The 
most important contributing factors to this increase are the improvement of the 
health service delivery system, increased life expectancy, and the aging of the 
population. The aim of this study was to develop Iran's "National Cancer Control 
Program" (IrNCCP).
METHODS: The present study is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2013 
using the method of reviewing studies and documents and focused group 
discussions and a panel of experts. In this study, the available evidence 
related to cancer status and its care in Iran and other countries, as well as 
national and international upstream documents, were reviewed and analyzed. Then, 
by analyzing the current situation in Iran and other countries and conducting 
stakeholder analysis with the strategic planning approach, the IrNCCP was 
developed with a 12-year horizon consisting of goals, strategies, programs, and 
performance indicators.
RESULTS: This program has 4 main components, including Prevention, Early 
Detection, Diagnosis and Treatment, and Supportive and Palliative care, as well 
as 7 supporting components including Governance and policy-making, Cancer 
Research, Developing facilities, equipment, and service delivery network, 
Providing and managing human resources, Providing and managing financial 
resources, Cancer information system management and registry, and Participation 
of NGOs, charities, and the private sector.
CONCLUSION: Iran's National Cancer Control Program has been developed 
comprehensively with cross-sectoral cooperation and stakeholder participation. 
However, like any long-term health intervention, strengthening its governance 
structure both in terms of implementation and achievement of expected goals and 
evaluation and modification during the implementation of the program is 
essential.

How Uncertainty Matters Under Risk Neutrality.

It is typical in cost-effectiveness analysis to invoke a normative 
decision-making framework that assumes, as a starting point, that "a 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a QALY is a QALY." The implication of this 
assumption is that the decision maker is risk neutral and that expected values 
could be considered sufficiently informative for a given "approve or reject" 
decision. Nevertheless, it seems intuitive that less uncertainty should be 
desirable and this has led some to incorporate "real" risk aversion (RA) into 
cost-effectiveness analysis. We illustrate in this article that RA is not always 
necessary to justify choosing more over less certain options. We show that for a 
risk neutral decision maker, greater uncertainty can make the approval of 
technology less likely in the presence of (1) model nonlinearities, (2) 
nonlinear opportunity costs, and (3) irreversible costs. We call these cases of 
"apparent" RA. Incorporating explicit risk preferences into decision making can 
be challenging; nevertheless, as we show here, it is not necessary to justify 
caring about uncertainty in approval decisions.

In recent years, checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of 
previously untreatable malignant tumors, significantly improving the life 
expectancy as well as quality of life in many cases. Checkpoint inhibitors 
comprise a group of drugs with different mechanisms of action. These include 
immunological checkpoint inhibitors (iCPI) and intracellular signal transduction 
inhibitors; however, both substance classes can cause inflammatory or toxic 
ocular side effects. The frequency of intraocular inflammation (uveitis) is 
reported to be ca. 1-2%, toxic side effects were observed in up to more than 50% 
of the patients treated with signal transduction inhibitors. In the following 
article the main mechanisms of these forms of treatment are characterized. 
Furthermore, this article presents the currently most frequently used 
therapeutic agents and their typical ophthalmological side effects to increase 
awareness and to draw attention to these still rare but increasingly more 
frequent findings.

Publisher: In den letzten Jahren haben Checkpointinhibitoren die Behandlung von 
zuvor unbehandelbaren bösartigen Tumoren revolutioniert und sowohl 
Lebenserwartung wie auch -qualität teilweise erheblich verbessert. 
Checkpointinhibitoren umfassen eine Gruppe von Medikamenten mit 
unterschiedlichen Wirkmechanismen. Dazu gehören einerseits die immunologischen 
Checkpointinhibitoren (iCPI) und andererseits die intrazellulären 
Signaltransduktionsinhibitoren. Beide Substanzklassen können entzündliche oder 
toxische okuläre Nebenwirkungen verursachen. Die Häufigkeit intraokulärer 
Entzündungen (Uveitis) wird mit etwa 1–2 % angegeben, toxische Nebenwirkungen 
wurden bei bis zu über 50 % der Patienten nach Behandlung mit 
Signaltransduktionsinhibitoren beobachtet. Im Folgenden sollen die wesentlichen 
Mechanismen dieser Substanzklassen charakterisiert werden. Darüber hinaus werden 
in diesem Beitrag die aktuell gängigsten Therapeutika und deren typische 
Nebenwirkungen am Auge dargestellt, um das Bewusstsein und die Aufmerksamkeit 
für diese noch seltenen, aber zunehmend häufigeren Befunde zu steigern.

THINKING THE DREAM: DREAM AND DREAM THINKING IN SIGMUND FREUD, HANNA SEGAL, AND 
WILFRED BION.

In the dream and its interpretation, psychoanalysis, in its founding period 
around 1900, identified the "royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious in the 
psychic life." But already in the development of Freud's work itself, the dream 
lost its central position: As early as in the 1920s, psychoanalysis ceased to be 
a theory and practice defined by dream interpretation-a caesura in a process 
which completed itself in 1950. Two further developments proved, up to the 
present day, particularly momentous for the conception of the dream: Melanie 
Klein's development of the concept of "unconscious phantasy" and the extension 
of psychoanalytic treatment to psychosis, originally declared inaccessible to 
psychoanalytic therapy by Freud. This article draws an itinerary of this path 
and the subsequent fundamental changes in the psychoanalytic reflection on the 
dream affecting the whole of psychoanalysis until today, by casting spotlights 
on essential stations: conceptions of the dream developed by Hanna Segal and 
Wilfred Bion, the latter's theory perpetuating Freud's dream theory as well as 
it conceptualizes dreams, dreaming, and thinking in a fundamentally new way.

Women over 50 who use alcohol and their engagement with primary and preventative 
health services: a narrative review using a systematic approach.

BACKGROUND: Women who are over 50 years are drinking alcohol in higher 
quantities and more frequently than in previous decades. Good engagement with 
primary care is crucial for women's physical and psychological health, 
particularly if they use alcohol. However, there is little known about the 
alcohol use of women over 50 and their use of primary care.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on six databases; CINAHL, Medline, 
PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE and Web of Science to identify 
literature on primary health care engagement of women 50 years and older (50+) 
who use alcohol. Titles and abstracts were reviewed and full texts were 
independently reviewed by two researchers. A narrative review, critical 
appraisal and synthesis of the eligible studies produced common themes and key 
findings.
RESULTS: After excluding 3822 articles, 13 articles were deemed eligible for the 
review. For this age group (50+), findings were: 1) women who drink heavily were 
less likely than men to attend General Practitioners (GPs), moderate drinkers 
were more likely than abstainers to attend mammogram screening, 2) GPs were less 
likely to ask questions or discuss alcohol with women than with men, 3) GPs 
offered less advice on alcohol to women than to men, and 4) less women than men 
received alcohol screening from their GP.
DISCUSSION: While women 50+ are drinking more, their alcohol use is 
underreported and insufficiently provided for in primary health. As women's life 
expectancy increases, improved GP engagement will benefit women's health and 
reduce future healthcare costs.

It is estimated that colorectal cancer is the cancer disease with the highest 
incidence in Spain  due to the increase in life expectancy and changes in the 
lifestyle of the population . Early detection through disease screening programs 
allows for more effective treatment and a higher survival rate . Advances in 
treatment have been made, such as targeted therapies, which focus on 
specifically attacking cancer cells and preventing their growth . However, much 
remains to be done in terms of prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. 
More research and medical advances are required to combat this disease.

Publisher: Se estima que el cáncer colorrectal es la enfermedad oncológica que 
presenta mayor incidencia en España  debido al incremento en la esperanza de 
vida y a los cambios en el estilo de vida de la población . La detección precoz 
mediante los programas de cribado de la enfermedad permite un tratamiento más 
efectivo y una mayor tasa de supervivencia . Se han realizado avances en el 
tratamiento, como las terapias dirigidas, que se centran en atacar 
específicamente a las células cancerosas y prevenir su crecimiento . Sin 
embargo, todavía queda mucho por hacer en términos de prevención y tratamiento 
del cáncer colorrectal. Se requiere más investigación y más avances médicos para 
combatir esta enfermedad.

INTRODUCTION: Recurrent falling is a major clinical milestone in Parkinsonian 
syndromes. It has a detrimental impact on quality of life, further prognosis, 
and life expectancy.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To improve fall management and prevention, we aimed at 
identifying clinical parameters predicting fall frequency. To this end, we 
retrospectively analysed records of fall events of patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD), or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or multiple system 
atrophy (MSA), during their two-week inpatient stay at the Parkinson-Klinik 
Ortenau, Wolfach, Germany. This data served as an objective proxy for patients' 
fall frequency and allowed us to estimate the impact of several demographic and 
clinical variables on the occurrence of falling.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of 2,111 patients admitted to our hospital, 1,810 
presented with PD, 191 with PSP, and 110 with MSA. We employed a multiple 
(quasi-) poisson regression analysis to model the fall frequency as a function 
of various demographic variables (age at diagnosis, gender) and clinical 
variables (disease duration and sub-type, motor and cognitive impairment, 
autonomic dysfunction).
RESULTS: Statistically significant predictors for falls in PD were cognitive 
impairment, motor impairment, and autonomic dysfunction. In PSP, significant 
predictors for falls were motor and autonomic dysfunction, while in MSA only 
disease duration predicted falls, but with only marginal statistical 
significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results stress the importance of different factors in 
predicting falls in the different types of Parkinsonian syndrome. Preventive 
interventions should address these disease-specific targets for optimal success.

Patent foramen ovale closure after cryptogenic stroke: sometimes uncertain 
benefit maybe, or even potential harm in the long run?

Monfalcone Hospital, ASUGI, Gorizia.

The main published studies on patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure after 
cryptogenic stroke tend to consider it positively, in light of the reported both 
procedural risk profile and outcomes. On the other hand, many blind spots and 
controversial issues of the topic are still present, mainly including both early 
procedural complications, and mid- and long-term associated comorbidities as 
well. Oftentimes, several biases appear to be present, with the evident risk of 
modifying indications for both intervention, and decision-making process. Biases 
should be considered and discussed during the diagnostic approach as well, 
including the supposed evidence of correlation, or cause-effect relationship, 
between the clinical event and patent foramen ovale. Furthermore, such studies 
have mostly shown results based on short-term follow-up and very low event 
rates. Conversely, those patients will keep the device lifelong, generally with 
long life expectancy, and the increased possibility of recurrent stroke from any 
other cause over time, along with many potential device-related comorbidities 
(e.g. atrial fibrillation, nearby anatomical structures impairment, and 
thrombosis). Consequently, it is hard to demonstrate the mid-term and long-term 
device-related advantages, due to the possible higher incidence of stroke 
associated with iatrogenic or concurrent factors. Thus, larger, well designed, 
long-term, multicentric, and more inclusive studies are needed, aimed to 
demonstrate a net clinical benefit, ideally including a number-needed-to-treat 
calculation at short-term, mid-term, and long-term, as well as taking into 
account and comparing the long-term complications, related outcomes, and 
recurrent events in patients with and without devices.

Nightingale Nursing Faculty, İstanbul, Turkey.

Palliative care is an important component of integrated, person-centered health 
care. It can be provided alone or in combination with the patient's medical 
treatment, not only by the palliative care team but also by the healthcare team 
caring for the patient. The concept of palliative care was developed in 2010 
along with the establishment of the National Cancer Control Program in Turkey, 
and today there are many palliative care units, especially in metropolitan 
hospitals, that provide comprehensive palliative care. One-third of patients who 
come to the palliative care unit for treatment of pain, malnutrition, and 
respiratory problems are cancer patients. The care needs of all patients 
presenting to the palliative care unit are assessed, and a multidisciplinary 
team plans comprehensive palliative care for patients. Theoretical and practical 
patient care training is provided by palliative care nurses for family members 
or caregivers. Considering the burden of cancer as well as the increasing life 
expectancy at birth, it can be stated that the actual need for palliative care 
in Turkey will be much greater in the near future.

BACKGROUND: Reducing health outcomes disparities in Africa is a major concern 
for policymakers. Inter-country disparities in Africa is well documented. 
However, little is known about the accurate trajectory of these disparities over 
time. Thus, this paper investigates the convergence hypothesis in health 
outcomes in 40 African countries using data from the World Development 
Indicators. The study used panel data from 2000 to 2019.
METHOD: The study employs a nonlinear time-varying factor model to test the
