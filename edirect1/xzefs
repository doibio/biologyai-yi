The key trends driving the global dairy market are shelf-life extension and 
generating consumer demand for new products. Healthy diets and special foods 
meet the criteria based on the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score, 
while other factors affecting the digestibility and actual biological value of 
the protein are not considered. Express biological evaluation tests are very 
important for choosing the optimal formulation and efficient manufacturing 
process in order to maximize the biological value (BV). Such tests adequately 
represent the food properties: safety, nutrition value, digestibility, health 
benefits, etc. This study deals with the procedures for the quick biological 
evaluation of dairy products using indicator organisms. We adapted the relative 
biological value evaluation procedure, involving Tetrahymena pyriformis, for 
curd (cottage cheese) and curd products. The experiments showed that the most 
significant parameters are the milk pasteurization temperature and the curd 
heating temperature. The full factorial experiment identified the optimal curd 
production conditions to maximize the relative biological value (RBV): 81 °C 
milk pasteurization temperature and 54 °C curd heating temperature using the 
acid method of curd production. With these parameters, the RBV is at least 282%. 
Biotesting confirmed the optimal curd product component ratio of 60% curd to 40% 
fermented dairy beverage.

Processed cheese is a dairy product with multiple end-use applications, where 
emulsifying salts play a fundamental role in physicochemical changes during 
production. Moreover, some of these salts may be a strategy to control spoilage 
and pathogenic microorganisms, contributing to safety and shelf life extension. 
This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory activity of two emulsifying 
salts (ESSP = short polyP and BSLP = long polyP) against Bacillus thuringiensis 
CFBP 3476 and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and to compare the in situ 
effects of two emulsifying salts treatments (T1 = 1.5% ESSP and T2 = 1.0% ESSP + 
0.5% BSLP) in processed cheeses obtained by two different methods (laboratory- 
and pilot-scales), during 45-day storage at 6 °C. C. perfringens ATCC 13124 
growth was not affected in vitro or in situ (p > 0.05), but both of the 
treatments reduced B. thuringiensis CFBP 4376 counts in the tested condition. 
Counts of the treatments with B. thuringiensis CFBP 3476 presented a higher and 
faster reduction in cheeses produced by the laboratory-scale method (1.6 log 
cfu/g) when compared to the pilot-scale method (1.8 log cfu/g) (p < 0.05). For 
the first time, the inhibitory effect of emulsifying salts in processed cheeses 
obtained by two different methods was confirmed, and changes promoted by 
laboratory-scale equipment influenced important interactions between the 
processed cheese matrix and emulsifying salts, resulting in B. thuringiensis 
CFBP 4376 growth reduction.

Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) meat, as a product of national geographical 
indication, is mainly produced in the northwest regions of China. This study 
systematically evaluated the edible quality, nutritional quality, and 
carcinogenic substances of Bactrian camel meat using different heating times in 
four thermal processing methods (steaming, boiling, frying, and microwaving). 
Compared with the control group (uncooked), the thermal processing of meat 
demonstrated lower redness and moisture content; higher shear force values and 
protein, fat, and ash contents; and sharply increased the levels of amino acids 
and fatty acids. The moisture content of the fried and microwave-treated meat 
was significantly lower than that of the steamed and boiled meat (p < 0.05). 
Steamed meat was higher in protein but had a lower fat content than the other 
three processing methods (p < 0.05). Compared with frying and microwaving, meat 
from steaming and boiling showed higher levels of essential amino acids and 
lower shear force values. However, the smoke generated during frying led to the 
formation of large amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 
nitrites, and the levels of these substances increased with heating time. In 
addition, with the extension of the heating time, the shear force of the meat 
also increased gradually (p < 0.05). In summary, steaming and boiling were 
proven to be suitable processing methods for preserving better nutritional 
values while delivering less carcinogenic risk. With our results, we have 
established a nutritional database for Bactrian camel meat, providing a 
reference for selecting a suitable thermal processing method.

BACKGROUND: The advent of targeted therapies and immunotherapies has 
revolutionized metastatic melanoma (MM) management but their use is associated 
with high daily costs compared to chemotherapies: €2 for dacarbazine versus €175 
for immunotherapies and €413 for targeted therapies. While overall survival (OS) 
has increased, healthcare expenditures are expected to double by 2030.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the median OS and costs for MM 
patients in order to evaluate the effectiveness of new biological or targeted 
therapies (NT) used since 2013 compared to chemotherapies.
MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a retrospective monocentric cost-effectiveness 
analysis performed in CHU Nantes (Nantes University Hospital). All MM patients 
treated with conventional chemotherapy as first-line treatment between 2008 and 
2012 were included (CHEMO group). The same number of patients treated with NT as 
first-line between 2013 and 2017 were included (NT group).
RESULTS: In total, 161 patients were included in each group. The mean age at 
diagnosis was 64.7±2.4 years in the CHEMO group and 65.3±2.4 years in the NT 
group (not significant). The men/women ratio was 1.48 and 1.27, respectively, 
(not significant). The median OS was 158 days in the CHEMO group and 395 days in 
the NT group (p<0.001). Treatment cost was €10,280/patient versus 
€94,676/patient, respectively. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
€90,184/LY (95% CI: €59,637; €166,395).
CONCLUSION: Our study assessed clinical and economic features associated with MM 
management before and after the advent of NT. Costs and life expectancy have 
increased. NT appears to be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: The rehabilitation of maxillectomy defects is a challenging 
endeavour that necessitates customizing the procedure for each patient. The 
successful treatment for these patients requires a combined conventional and 
contemporary treatment options. The high-tech prosthodontic treatment option for 
these defects and distal extension cases are combining fixed and removable 
partial dentures with precision/semi-precision attachments. It will enhance 
retention, stability, esthetics and functional ability of the prosthesis.
METHODS: Three post-Covid Mucormycosis patients reported after localised 
debridement and partial maxillectomy for definitive rehabilitation. For partial 
Maxillectomy patients, DMLS designed cast partial denture along with 
semi-precision attachments (Preci-vertix and OT strategy Rhein For patient with 
localized defect, DMLS designed cast partial denture was planned. For both 
patients the defect area was kept as hollow cavity (Closed or Open), in order to 
reduce the weight of the prosthesis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The prosthodontic rehabilitation of these patient can be 
a simple and economical treatment options and it improves the stomatognathic 
functions and quality of life of the patient. The major hurdles during 
rehabilitation are retention and stability as there is no basal seat and hard 
tissue support. Hence, we tried a combined conventional and digital techniques 
in order to provide prosthesis with precise fit and accuracy as well as reducing 
the treatment time and visits of the patients.

BACKGROUND: Increasing specialisation and technical sophistication of medical 
tools across the 21st century have contributed to dramatic improvements in the 
life-expectancy of children and adolescents with complex physical health 
problems. Concurrently, there is growing appreciation within the community of 
the extent that children and adolescents experience mental disorders, which are 
more prevalent in those with complex chronic, serious or life-limiting health 
conditions. In this context, there are compelling reasons for paediatric 
services to move to a model of care that promotes greater integration of child 
psychiatry within the medical, somatic teams that care for children and 
adolescents in children's hospitals.
AIMS: In this article, we discuss the range of medical disorders managed by 
contemporary paediatrics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a broad review of the literature and 
existing services, and use individual accounts to illustrate adolescents' 
healthcare preferences in the context of the challenges they experience around 
their mental health.
RESULTS: Relevant disorders include life-limiting disorders, such as cancer; 
disorders involving the brain, such as epilepsy; common chronic disorders, such 
as asthma and diabetes; psychiatric emergencies, such as deliberate self-harm; 
and conditions that most commonly present to paediatric services, but where 
psychiatric input is required, such as severe eating disorders, somatic symptom 
disorders and gender dysphoria. The persisting legacy of the historical 
separation of physical and mental health services is described. Yet there are 
many models of service integration that can promote more collaborative care 
between psychiatrists and medical specialists, including some which have been 
taken to scale.
DISCUSSION: In essence, clinical teams in children's hospitals require more 
collaborative approaches that facilitate early recognition and treatment of the 
psychological aspects of illness as an integral part of patient-centred, 
family-focussed paediatric care, rather than as something that is bolted on when 
things go wrong.
CONCLUSION: Whilst trust and goodwill between services and providers will be 
required for novel models of care to be implemented, evaluation of these new 
models and incorporation of young people's healthcare preferences is needed.

OBJECTIVE: The best results in glioblastoma (GBM) are obtained through 
aggressive treatment comprising maximally radical but safe resection followed by 
chemoradiotherapy. However, certain patients will undergo only stereotactic 
biopsy. This paper aims to evaluate life expectancy in GBM patients who 
underwent only stereotactic biopsy, including the effect of subsequent 
oncological treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with confirmed GBM histology who had undergone 
stereotactic biopsy between June 2006 and December 2016 were retrospectively 
selected. Each patient had received a CT scan, followed by an MRI scan with a 
contrast agent. None of the patients were amenable to microsurgical resection.
RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 41 (69%) received no subsequent oncological 
treatment, while 14 (23%) underwent isolated radiotherapy. Mean survival time of 
all patients was 2.8 months. Those who received no additional treatment had an 
average survival time of 2.3 months; patients who received any type of 
oncological treatment was 3.7 months. Of these, those receiving radiotherapy 
alone had a mean survival of 3.1 months. Patients who received oncological 
treatment with the Stupp protocol had a survival time of 6.6 months.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostic and surgical advances related to GBM treatment mean that 
radical resections can be performed even in eloquent brain areas. However, 
patients not indicated for resection will experience a major reduction in life 
expectancy. Patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy and received some form of 
oncological treatment experienced slightly increased overall survival relative 
to patients with a natural disease course. Patients with favorable clinical 
factors reacted better to treatment.

BACKGROUND: Despite known racial disparities in advance care planning (ACP), 
little is known about ACP disparities experienced by US immigrants.
METHODS: We used data from the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study. We 
defined ACP engagement as self-reported end-of-life (EOL) discussions, 
designation of a power of attorney (DPOA), documented living will, or "any" of 
the three behaviors. Immigration status was determined by respondent-reported 
birth outside the United States. Time in the United States was calculated by 
subtracting the year of arrival in the United States from the survey year of 
2016. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association 
between ACP engagement and immigration status and the relationship of 
acculturation to ACP engagement, adjusting for sociodemographics, religiosity, 
and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Of the total cohort (N = 9928), 10% were immigrants; 45% of immigrants 
identified as Hispanic. After adjustment, immigrants had significantly lower 
adjusted probability of any ACP engagement (immigrants: 74% vs. US-born: 83%, 
p < 0.001), EOL discussions (67% vs. 77%, p < 0.001), DPOA designation (50% vs. 
59%, p = 0.001) and living will documentation (50% vs. 56%, p = 0.03). Among 
immigrants, each year in the United States was associated with a 4% increase in 
the odds of any ACP engagement (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), ranging from 36% 
engaged 10 years after immigration to 78% after 70 years.
CONCLUSION: ACP engagement was lower for US immigrants compared to US-born older 
adults, particularly for those that recently immigrated. Future studies should 
explore strategies to reduce disparities in ACP and the unique ACP needs among 
different immigrant populations.

BACKGROUND: Asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD) are chronic allergic conditions, 
along with allergic rhinitis and food allergy and cause high morbidity and 
mortality both in children and adults. This study aims to evaluate the global, 
regional, national, and temporal trends of the burden of asthma and AD from 1990 
to 2019 and analyze their associations with geographic, demographic, social, and 
clinical factors.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2019, we assessed the age-standardized prevalence, incidence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of both asthma and AD from 
1990 to 2019, stratified by geographic region, age, sex, and socio-demographic 
index (SDI). DALYs were calculated as the sum of years lived with disability and 
years of life lost to premature mortality. Additionally, the disease burden of 
asthma attributable to high body mass index, occupational asthmagens, and 
smoking was described.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were a total of 262 million [95% uncertainty interval 
(UI): 224-309 million] cases of asthma and 171 million [95% UI: 165-178 million] 
total cases of AD globally; age-standardized prevalence rates were 3416 [95% UI: 
2899-4066] and 2277 [95% UI: 2192-2369] per 100,000 population for asthma and 
AD, respectively, a 24.1% [95% UI: -27.2 to -20.8] decrease for asthma and a 
4.3% [95% UI: 3.8-4.8] decrease for AD compared to baseline in 1990. Both asthma 
and AD had similar trends according to age, with age-specific prevalence rates 
peaking at age 5-9 years and rising again in adulthood. The prevalence and 
incidence of asthma and AD were both higher for individuals with higher SDI; 
however, mortality and DALYs rates of individuals with asthma had a reverse 
trend, with higher mortality and DALYs rates in those in the lower SDI 
quintiles. Of the three risk factors, high body mass index contributed to the 
highest DALYs and deaths due to asthma, accounting for a total of 3.65 million 
[95% UI: 2.14-5.60 million] asthma DALYs and 75,377 [95% UI: 40,615-122,841] 
asthma deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Asthma and AD continue to cause significant morbidity worldwide, 
having increased in total prevalence and incidence cases worldwide, but having 
decreased in age-standardized prevalence rates from 1990 to 2019. Although both 
are more frequent at younger ages and more prevalent in high-SDI countries, each 
condition has distinct temporal and regional characteristics. Understanding the 
temporospatial trends in the disease burden of asthma and AD could guide future 
policies and interventions to better manage these diseases worldwide and achieve 
equity in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

NOAC Therapy According to CHA2DS2-VASc Without Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic 
Review.

Maddalena R(1).

Author information:
(1)From the Cardiology Unit, Anzio-Nettuno Hospital, Anzio (RM), Italy.

According to Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy, novel oral anticoagulant therapy 
is preferred when the stroke risk is higher than 0.9% per year. CHA2DS2-VASc is 
a tool to select those patients at high risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis 
and atrial cardiopathy, who could benefit from anticoagulation even in sinus 
rhythm. Systematic electronic database searches were conducted using Pubmed and 
Scopus. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Statement 2020 was followed. Thirteen studies were included, comprising 
altogether 19,600,104 patients. Data show that the predictive accuracy for 
stroke of CHA2DS2-VASc among patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF) 
is similar, but the benefit of anticoagulation, considering the 1-year risk of 
stroke for every CHA2DS2-VASc value, starts from higher cutoffs in patients 
without AF (around CHA2DS2-VASc 4). Atrial fibrillation should no longer be 
considered a sine qua non for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients at 
high risk of stroke due to atherosclerosis and atrial disease, but only an 
additional risk factor to be included in the predictive model used to select 
patients for novel oral anticoagulant therapy, regardless of the rhythm. 
CHA2DS2-VASc-AF may be an option. Additional randomized clinical trials are 
needed.

The increase in life expectancy can be a consequence of the world's 
socioeconomic, sanitary and nutritional conditions. Some studies have 
demonstrated that individuals with a satisfactory diet variety score present a 
lower risk of malnutrition and better health status. Zinc and selenium are 
important micronutrients that play a role in many biochemical and physiological 
processes of the immune system. Deficient individuals can present both innate 
and adaptive immunity abnormalities and increased susceptibility to infections. 
Primary immunodeficiency diseases, also known as inborn errors of immunity, are 
genetic disorders classically characterized by an increased susceptibility to 
infection and/or dysregulation of a specific immunologic pathway. IgA deficiency 
(IgAD) is the most common primary antibody deficiency. This disease is defined 
as serum IgA levels lower than 7 mg/dL and normal IgG and IgM levels in 
individuals older than four years. Although many patients are asymptomatic, 
selected patients suffer from different clinical complications, such as 
pulmonary infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal disorders 
and malignancy. Knowing the nutritional status as well as the risk of zinc and 
selenium deficiency could be helpful for the management of IgAD patients.
OBJECTIVES: to investigate the anthropometric, biochemical, and nutritional 
profiles and the status of zinc and selenium in patients with IgAD.
METHODS: in this descriptive study, we screened 16 IgAD patients for 
anthropometric and dietary data, biochemical evaluation and determination of 
plasma and erythrocyte levels of zinc and selenium.
RESULTS: dietary intake of zinc and selenium was adequate in 75% and 86% of the 
patients, respectively. These results were consistent with the plasma levels 
(adequate levels of zinc in all patients and selenium in 50% of children, 25% of 
adolescents and 100% of adults). However, erythrocyte levels were low for both 
micronutrients (deficiency for both in 100% of children, 75% of adolescents and 
25% of adults).
CONCLUSION: our results highlight the elevated prevalence of erythrocyte zinc 
and selenium deficiency in patients with IgAD, and the need for investigation of 
these micronutrients in their follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (US-PEIT) is 
used in patients with recurrent symptomatic thyroid cysts as a credible 
alternative to surgery. Young patients commonly do not wish to undergo surgery 
and prefer ethanol ablation, if available. The effect of this approach on 
quality of life is an essential factor in deciding on the treatment options, 
especially in the young with a long life expectancy and no comorbidity.
METHODS: We performed US-PEIT in a cohort of young patients, 15-30 years, from 
2015 to 2020. The patients' general quality of life (QoL), self-reported 
compression symptoms and neck appearance were evaluated.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 59 patients with 63 cysts, more women than men, 
with a mean age of 23.8 years. About 1.5 mL of injected alcohol were needed to 
reach a 90.7% mean cyst volume reduction ratio in 12 months. The method did not 
fail in any of the patients; a single US-PEIT session was undertaken in 46% of 
them. The procedure significantly improved each of the patients' symptoms with a 
significant total score difference (P < 0.001). The total symptom score 
correlated with the initial cyst volume (P = 0.002; r = 0.395). The mean QoL 
score by SF-36 6 months after the last US-PEIT was significantly different for 
physical component summary 56.5 (P < 0.001) but not different for mental 
component summary 47.7 (P = 0.125), compared to age-corresponding norms.
CONCLUSIONS: US-PEIT is a safe and effective method for the young, leading to 
improvements in cosmetic and subjective complaints, and should also be 
considered as first-line treatment in the young.

The optimal management of hypertension in individuals aged 80 years or older 
with frailty remains uncertain due to multiple gaps in evidence. Complex health 
issues, polypharmacy, and limited physiological reserve make responding to 
antihypertensive treatments unpredictable. Patients in this age group may have 
limited life expectancy, so their quality of life should be prioritized when 
making treatment decisions. Further research is needed to identify which 
patients would benefit from more relaxed blood pressure targets and which 
antihypertensive medications are preferable or should be avoided. A paradigm 
shift is required in attitudes towards treatment, placing equal emphasis on 
deprescribing and prescribing when optimizing care. This review discusses the 
current evidence on managing hypertension in individuals aged 80 years or older 
with frailty, but further research is essential to address the gaps in knowledge 
and improve the care of this population.

Global increase of life expectancy is rarely accompanied by increased health 
span, calling for a greater understanding of age-associated behavioral decline. 
Motor independence is strongly associated with the quality of life of elderly 
people, yet the regulators for motor aging have not been systematically 
explored. Here, we designed a fast and efficient genome-wide screening assay in 
Caenorhabditis elegans and identified 34 consistent genes as potential 
regulators of motor aging. Among the top hits, we found VPS-34, the class III 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) to 
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), regulates motor function in aged but 
not young worms. It primarily functions in aged motor neurons by inhibiting 
PI(3)P-PI-PI(4)P conversion to reduce neurotransmission at the neuromuscular 
junction (NMJ). Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of VPS-34 improve 
neurotransmission and muscle integrity, ameliorating motor aging in both worms 
and mice. Thus, our genome-wide screening revealed an evolutionarily conserved, 
actionable target to delay motor aging and prolong health span.

Sighthounds, a distinctive group of hounds comprising numerous breeds, have 
their origins rooted in ancient artificial selection of dogs. In this study, we 
performed genome sequencing for 123 sighthounds, including one breed from 
Africa, six breeds from Europe, two breeds from Russia, and four breeds and 12 
village dogs from the Middle East. We gathered public genome data of five 
sighthounds and 98 other dogs as well as 31 gray wolves to pinpoint the origin 
and genes influencing the morphology of the sighthound genome. Population 
genomic analysis suggested that sighthounds originated from native dogs 
independently and were comprehensively admixed among breeds, supporting the 
multiple origins hypothesis of sighthounds. An additional 67 published ancient 
wolf genomes were added for gene flow detection. Results showed dramatic 
admixture of ancient wolves in African sighthounds, even more than with modern 
wolves. Whole-genome scan analysis identified 17 positively selected genes 
(PSGs) in the African population, 27 PSGs in the European population, and 54 
PSGs in the Middle Eastern population. None of the PSGs overlapped in the three 
populations. Pooled PSGs of the three populations were significantly enriched in 
"regulation of release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol" (gene ontology: 
0051279), which is related to blood circulation and heart contraction. In 
addition, ESR1, JAK2, ADRB1, PRKCE, and CAMK2D were under positive selection in 
all three selected groups. This suggests that different PSGs in the same pathway 
contributed to the similar phenotype of sighthounds. We identified an ESR1 
mutation (chr1: g.42,177,149 T > C) in the transcription factor (TF) binding 
site of Stat5a and a JAK2 mutation (chr1: g.93,277,007 T > A) in the TF binding 
site of Sox5. Functional experiments confirmed that the ESR1 and JAK2 mutation
