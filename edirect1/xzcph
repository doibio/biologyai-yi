CONCLUSION: The evidence for social health inequalities and their determinants 
has substantially improved during the past 30 years; however, there remains 
substantial potential for future research questions, for example concerning the 
contribution of the different phases of life to healthy aging.

OBJECTIVE: The 2016 Chinese guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia 
recommended mixed rules that centered around a 10% 10-year risk threshold to 
initiate statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD). The present study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
the guideline statin-initiation strategy and alternative strategies.
METHODS: A decision analytic model using discrete event simulation with event 
probabilities based on a validated ASCVD risk prediction tool for Chinese was 
constructed. Risk factor inputs were from the dataset of a nationally 
representative survey of middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Data of statin 
treatment effectiveness were from a published meta-analysis. Other key input 
data were identified from the literature or relevant databases. The strategies 
we evaluated were the guideline strategy, a 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy 
and a 20% 10-year risk threshold strategy. After excluding any extended 
dominance strategies, the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained of each strategy was calculated.
RESULTS: The 20% 10-year risk threshold strategy was an extended dominance 
option. The incremental costs per QALY gained from the 15% 10-year risk 
threshold strategy compared with no treatment and the guideline strategy 
compared with the 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy were CN¥69,309 and 
CN¥154,944, respectively. The results were robust in most sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The guideline strategy and the 15% 10-year risk threshold strategy 
are optimal when using the three times and the two times the gross domestic 
product per capita willingness-to-pay standards, respectively.

Aims The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, management and outcomes 
of incidentally diagnosed prostate cancer following TURP. Methods A 
retrospective review was performed using the histopathological departments’ 
database of all patients who underwent a TURP across two university teaching 
hospitals over a ten year period. Results During the study period, a total of 
826 patients underwent a TURP. 72 (10.3%) had an incidental diagnosis of CaP 
following TURP. 46 (63.9%) were managed expectantly while 26 (36.1%) underwent 
active treatment. Overall mortality was 29.2% (n=21) while cancer specific 
mortality was 6.9% (n=5). All these patients were in the hormonal treatment 
sub-group. Conclusion Our study demonstrates an expectant approach is favourable 
in low risk disease. Curative treatment does need to be considered for younger 
patients with a long life expectancy or patients with higher risk disease.

INTRODUCTION: Health-seeking behaviours are influenced by internal and external 
contributing factors. Internal factors include attitudes, beliefs and core 
values, life adaptation skills, psychological disposition whereas external 
factors include social support, media, socio-cultural, political, economic and 
biological aspects, health care systems, environmental stressors and societal 
laws and regulations. This study was meant to explore factors affecting 
health-seeking behaviors in the Somali regional state of Ethiopia. The study 
employed a cross-sectional study design using qualitative data collection tools. 
Data were collected from 50 individual interviews and 17 focused group 
discussions (FGD) on women of reproductive age and their partners, health 
extension workers (HEWs), health care providers and health administrators. To 
ensure representativeness, the region was categorized into three zones based on 
their settlement characteristics as agrarian, pastoralist and semi-pastoralist. 
Two districts (one from high and the other from low performance areas) were 
selected from each category. The data were entered, coded, categorized and 
analyzed using NVIVO version 11 software. The Socio-ecologic Model (SEM) was 
used for categorization.
RESULTS: Using the social ecological model, the following major barriers for 
health seeking behaviors were identified. Low socio-demographic and economic 
status, poor exposure to health information or mass media, detrimental 
preferences of breast feeding methods and short acting family planning (FP) 
methods were identified barriers at the individual level; male dominance in 
decision making, the influence of the husband and society and the role of word 
of mouth were identified barriers at the interpersonal level and lack of 
acceptance, fear of modern health practices, unclean health facility 
environment, lack of well-equipped facilities shortage of trained staffs and 
barriers relating to distance and transportation were barriers identified at 
organizational and policy level.
CONCLUSION: Overall, factors at various level affected health seeking behaviors 
of the Somali community. Socio-demographic and economic factors, non-responsive 
bureaucratic system, shortages or absence of medical supplies and human 
resources, lack of supportive supervision, a shortage of water and electricity 
at the health facility and an unclean service delivery environment are 
significant barriers to health-seeking behaviors for the community.

BACKGROUND: Calcimimetics have been shown to be effective and safe therapies for 
the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), a serious complication of 
disordered mineral metabolism associated with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney 
disease. Etelcalcetide, a recently approved intravenous calcimimetic, reduces 
serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and fibroblast growth 
factor-23 concentrations. Here we report the first integrated safety profile of 
etelcalcetide using pooled data from five pivotal clinical trials.
METHODS: This analysis included data from patients receiving hemodialysis with 
moderate to severe sHPT enrolled in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials; a 
randomized active-controlled (with cinacalcet) trial; and two single-arm, 
open-label extension trials. Patients initially received etelcalcetide 
intravenously 5 mg three times weekly (TIW) after hemodialysis; with potential 
dose increases of 2.5 or 5 mg at 4-week intervals to a maximum dose of 15 mg 
TIW, depending on serum PTH and calcium levels. The nature, frequency, and 
severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory 
parameters were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, we evaluated 1023 patients from the placebo-controlled trials, 
683 from the active-controlled trial, and 1299 from open-label extensions. The 
frequency and nature of common treatment-emergent AEs reported for the 
etelcalcetide arm were consistent among the placebo-controlled and 
active-controlled trials. The most common AEs were those related to mineral 
metabolism (decreased blood calcium, hypophosphatemia, muscle spasms) or 
gastrointestinal abnormalities (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). Hypocalcemia 
leading to discontinuation of either calcimimetic was experienced in ≤ 1% of 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This integrated safety assessment of etelcalcetide across placebo- 
and active-controlled trials showed an overall favorable risk/benefit profile, 
with safety similar to that of cinacalcet. Consistent with its mechanism of 
action, the most important risks associated with etelcalcetide were serum 
calcium reductions and hypocalcemia-related AEs; no new safety findings were 
identified in the pooled long-term extension trials.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have widely assessed heat-mortality relationships 
across global regions, while the epidemiological evidence regarding the heat 
effect on years of life lost (YLL) is relatively sparse. Current investigations 
using daily mean data cannot take hourly temperature variation into 
consideration and may underestimate heat effects. We developed a novel 
indicator, daily excess hourly heat (DEHH), to precisely evaluate the potential 
heat effects on mortality and YLL.
METHODS: Hourly data on temperature and daily information, including 
concentrations of air pollutants, relative humidity, and records of all 
registered deaths were obtained in Wuhan, China during the warm seasons 
(May-September) of 2009-2012. DEHH, developed in this study, is defined as daily 
total hourly temperatures that exceed a specific heat threshold. By performing 
time series regression analyses, we assessed the changes in daily mortality and 
YLL per interquartile range (IQR) increase in DEHH across different lag days.
RESULTS: The heat threshold evaluated by the Akaike Information Criterion for 
DEHH calculation is 30 °C (92th percentile of whole-year mean temperature 
distribution). Daily average DEHH was 13.9 °C, with an IQR of 19.9 °C. Linear 
exposure-response curves were found between DEHH and two health outcomes. 
Generally, heat effects lasted for 2-3 days and DEHH at lag 0-1 was most 
strongly associated with increased mortality and YLL. The effects were 
especially remarkable for stroke and ischemic heart disease mortality. Most 
intense effect on YLL was found in non-accidental deaths (20.11, 95% confidence 
interval: 8.90-31.33) at lag 0-1. More DEHH-related mortality and YLL from 
cardiovascular deaths were observed among males. People aged 0-74 years and 
males suffered more from YLL burden due to high temperatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that DEHH may be an alternative indicator to 
precisely measure heat effects on daily mortality and YLL. Further DEHH-based 
evidence from large scale investigations is needed so as to better understand 
heat-associated health burden and improve public response to extremely high 
temperatures.

Kentucky bluegrass (KB, Poa pratensis) is one of the most widely used 
cool-season turfgrass species, but it is sensitive to drought stress. Molecular 
studies in KB are hindered by its large and complex genome structure. In this 
study, a comparative transcriptomic study was conducted between a short and long 
period of water deficiency. Three transcriptome libraries were constructed and 
then sequenced by using leaf RNA samples of plants at 0, 2, and 16 h after 
PEG6000 treatment. A total of 199,083 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
found. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation revealed 
that DEGs were enriched in "Plant hormone signal transduction" and "MAPK 
signaling pathway-Plant". Some key up-regulated genes, including PYL, JAZ, and 
BSK, were involved in hormone signaling transduction of abscisic acid, jasmonic 
acid, and brassinosteroid and possibly these genes play important roles in 
coping with drought stress in KB. Furthermore, our results showed that the 
concentrations of ABA, JA and BR increased significantly with the extension of 
the drought period. The specific DEGs encoding functional proteins, kinase and 
transcription factors, could be valuable information for genetic manipulation to 
promote drought tolerance of KB in the future.

BACKGROUND: Owing to the increase in life expectancy and sickliness, caring for 
older adults has become a major challenge in China, where the traditional care 
system is disintegrating and community- and home-based care have been introduced 
to respond to this 'silver wave'. However, there is limited knowledge of the 
dilemmas associated with caring for older adults and the acceptability of 
community- and home-based care for this population.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from Xihu District, Hangzhou, from June to 
July 2017. In-depth interviews were conducted using semi-structured 
questionnaires. Audio recording, verbatim transcription, and thematic analysis 
were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 64 older adults from four communities were interviewed. Half 
of the participants had multiple chronic diseases. The very old individuals and 
those with severe diseases and in poor financial conditions were observed to be 
struggling the most. Health status, financial capability, and personality were 
the main factors affecting the care process. Participants cited the following 
reasons for staying away from nursing homes: misunderstanding, negative 
environment, a sense of shame, loneliness, and financial limitations. Community- 
and home-based cares are popular forms of old-age care; however, some 
participants exhibited a lack of knowledge about such services.
CONCLUSION: A multi-layered old-age care system is urgently needed for older 
adults in Zhejiang Province. Further, it is important that such a system 
integrates the care provided through community- and home-based services with 
that offered by nursing homes. Community- and home-based care for older adults 
needs to be prioritised, and the quality of care provided in nursing homes 
should be improved.

BACKGROUND: Rapid demographic, epidemiological, and nutritional transitons have 
brought a pressing need to track progress in adolescent health. Here, we present 
country-level estimates of 12 headline indicators from the Lancet Commission on 
adolescent health and wellbeing, from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: Indicators included those of health outcomes (disability-adjusted 
life-years [DALYs] due to communicable, maternal, and nutritional diseases; 
injuries; and non-communicable diseases); health risks (tobacco smoking, binge 
drinking, overweight, and anaemia); and social determinants of health 
(adolescent fertility; completion of secondary education; not in education, 
employment, or training [NEET]; child marriage; and demand for contraception 
satisfied with modern methods). We drew data from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016, International Labour Organisation, 
household surveys, and the Barro-Lee education dataset.
FINDINGS: From 1990 to 2016, remarkable shifts in adolescent health occurred. A 
decrease in disease burden in many countries has been offset by population 
growth in countries with the poorest adolescent health profiles. Compared with 
1990, an additional 250 million adolescents were living in multi-burden 
countries in 2016, where they face a heavy and complex burden of disease. The 
rapidity of nutritional transition is evident from the 324·1 million (18%) of 
1·8 billion adolescents globally who were overweight or obese in 2016, an 
increase of 176·9 million compared with 1990, and the 430·7 million (24%) who 
had anaemia in 2016, an increase of 74·2 million compared with 1990. Child 
marriage remains common, with an estimated 66 million women aged 20-24 years 
married before age 18 years. Although gender-parity in secondary school 
completion exists globally, prevalence of NEET remains high for young women in 
multi-burden countries, suggesting few opportunities to enter the workforce in 
these settings.
INTERPRETATION: Although disease burden has fallen in many settings, demographic 
shifts have heightened global inequalities. Global disease burden has changed 
little since 1990 and the prevalence of many adolescent health risks have 
increased. Health, education, and legal systems have not kept pace with shifting 
adolescent needs and demographic changes. Gender inequity remains a powerful 
driver of poor adolescent health in many countries.

Pressures on the health system are intense. Prevention is often seen as a 
sustainable way to manage these pressures. However, the impact of prevention on 
the demand for health and social care is not fully understood. It will reflect 
the balance of opposing forces: reduced needs for health and social care because 
of improving health and increased needs associated with increasing life 
expectancy and the diseases of old age, mediated by how the system manages the 
resulting pressures. This article illustrates how some of these factors are 
playing out in Scotland. The article also highlights the substantial growth in 
the evidence base on the economics of prevention and identifies policy 
developments with the potential to support a shift to prevention that might help 
move towards more sustainable demands on the health and social care system. 
These include recognition of the importance of the social determinants of 
health, the integration of health and social care and 'realistic medicine'. The 
article suggests that more use needs to be made of available evidence on the 
economics of prevention and that all stakeholders need to be engaged in tackling 
the technical and political challenges posed by the shift to prevention.

BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) with non-rechargeable implantable pulse generators (IPGs) 
require elective IPG replacement operations involving surgical and 
anesthesiologic risk. Life expectancy and the number of replacements per patient 
with DBS are increasing.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether IPG longevity is influenced by stimulation 
parameters alone or whether there is an independent effect of the number of 
battery replacements and IPG model.
METHODS: PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic DBS were included if 
there was at least one IPG replacement due to battery end of life. Fifty-five 
patients had one or two IPG replacements and seven had three or four 
replacements, (80 Kinetra® and 23 Activa-PC®). We calculated longevity corrected 
for total electrical energy delivered (TEED) and tested for the effect of IPG 
model and number of previous battery replacements on this measure.
RESULTS: TEED-corrected IPG longevity for the 1st implanted IPG was 51.3 months 
for Kinetra® and 35.6 months for Activa-PC®, which dropped by 5.9 months and 2.8 
months, respectively with each subsequent IPG replacement (p < 10-6 for IPG 
model and p < 10-3 for IPG number).
CONCLUSIONS: Activa-PC® has shorter battery longevity than the older Kinetra®, 
battery longevity reduces with repeated IPG replacements and these findings are 
independent of TEED. Battery longevity should be considered both in clinical 
decisions and in the design of new DBS systems. Clinicians need accessible, 
reliable and user-friendly tools to provide online estimated battery consumption 
and end of life. Furthermore, this study supports the consideration of using 
rechargeable IPGs in PD.

Future strategies of management of Alzheimer's Disease. The role of homotaurine.

of Thessaloniki, Makedonia, Greece. tsolakim1@gmail.com.

Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) particularly will become in future one of 
the major problems that healthcare systems will have to face with in developed 
but also in developing countries, because of the progressive aging of the 
population and the age-associated increase in their incidence. There is a rapid 
increasing in life expectancy and in elderly percentage. Unfortunately, 
improvements in lifespan have not been matched by improvements in mental health 
span. In recent years, there has been a growing interest, supported by a large 
number of experimental, epidemiological and clinical studies, about the 
beneficial effects of some natural products in preventing various age-related 
pathologic conditions, including brain aging and neurodegeneration. Homotaurine, 
a small aminosulfonate substance that is present in different species of marine 
red algae, has been shown, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, to provide a 
relevant neuroprotective effect by its specific anti-amyloid activity and by its 
γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor affinity. The name homotaurine was chosen 
because of its large homology with taurine (2 aminoethanesulfonate), which is 
one of the most abundant free amino acids in the brain. The two molecules share 
a very similar structure, but homotaurine contains one additional carbon. The 
therapeutic efficacy of homotaurine in AD has been investigated in three phase 
II, and in three Phase III clinical studies that did not reach their pre-defined 
primary endpoints. However, post-hoc analyses have shown positive and 
significant effects on secondary endpoints and subgroups of patients, including 
a reduction in hippocampal volume loss and lower decline in memory function in 
the overall cohort, as well as a reduction in global cognitive decline in APOE 
ε4 allele carriers, suggesting disease-modifying effects. Also in three post 
marketing (as supplement) studies in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) the results are very promising. In this review, we will present the 
pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting the potential role of homotaurine 
as a promising candidate for both primary and secondary prevention of AD.

[Technical characteristics of Alzheimer model based on organ technology

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder that manifests 
itself as progressive damage to memory and knowledge and is the main cause of 
dementia in the elderly. AD is characterized by extracellular deposition of 
amyloid-β plate (Aβ) and by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, composed 
of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. These modifications lead to neuronal cell 
death, vascular dysfunction and inflammatory disorders. Described as "elderly 
disease", AD is an escalating threat to developed countries as life expectancy 
is increasing. Because of its severity, AD has been the subject of extensive 
studies that address the pathogenesis of the disease. However, its main cause 
remains unknown. Most research on neurological conditions has been applied to 
animal models. However, due to their high cost and the uncertain translation of 
their results to humans along with moral concerns, in recent years, there has 
been a growing need for in vitro modeling to mimic the brain. The creation of 
the aforementioned models aims at a better understanding of the factors 
contributing to the onset of the disease and the faster development of the 
treatment of diseases affecting the nervous system. Given this need, in this 
review, new approaches to study neurodegenerative disease were recorded. A 
three-dimensional (3D) neurosphere-based microfluid chip has been reported and 
this model imitates the in vivo microenvironment of the brain and provides a 
steady flow of fluid that is observed in the brain's space. Uniform 
neurospheres, with cell interactions and contacts in all directions, were formed 
in a hollow microfuge and a steady interstitial flow rate was maintained using a 
small pump osmotic system. In this model it was possible to control the toxic 
effects of amyloid-β. At the end, it was observed that the deposition of 
amyloid-β through an osmotic micro-pump significantly reduced the viability of 
the neurospheres and caused destruction of the neuronal networks. Therefore, 
this model was proposed as an in vitro brain model for neurodegenerative disease 
and high-throughput drugs.

In Russia, Muscovites are in second place in terms of life expectancy (76,77 
years), second only to the Republic of Ingushetia (80,05 years). Possible 
factors for the successful aging of Muscovites are considered, among which the 
main role is presumably played not by environmental factors, but by social 
factors in the form of various forms of leisure that allow them to maintain high 
intellectual and physical activity. The possible participation of the regional 
branches of the Gerontological Society in information and educational programs 
on gerontology for the public and medical staff is discussed.

продолжительности жизни (76,77 года), уступая первое место Республике Ингушетии

среди которых основную роль предположительно играют не экологические, а 
социальные факторы в виде различных форм досуга, позволяющих поддерживать 
высокую интеллектуальную и физическую активность. Обсуждается возможное участие

The medical and demographic data on the health status of older citizens in the 
Republic Sakha (Yakutia) in 2000-2017 and the analysis of medical care for 
elderly patients in 2015-2017 demonstrated the urgent need to expand primary 
health care (including at home) and to organize specialized medical care for 
older citizens (including geriatric service) in one of the largest regions of 
Russia. The main directions of implementation in the Republic Sakha (Yakutia) of 
the Strategy of actions in the interests of the older generation of the Russian 
Federation until 2025 are given: the formation of the legislative basis, the 
creation of a three-level geriatric service, the introduction of new 
technologies for the provision of medical care to elderly residents of the 
Republic, training of personal. Measures are planned to implement the regional 
program «Older generation» of the National project «Demography» in order to 
improve the current medical and demographic situation and increase the life 
expectancy of the older generation and the whole population of Yakutia.

An Incipient Revolution in the Testing of Anti-aging Strategies.

Recent advances in the technology of "aging clocks" based on DNA methylation 
suggest that it may soon be possible to measure changes in the rate of human 
aging over periods as short as a year or two. If this potential is realized, the 
testing of putative anti-aging interventions will become radically cheaper and 
faster. This should prompt a re-appraisal of the entire spectrum of methods for 
evaluating anti-aging technologies in humans and in model systems. In the body 
of this article, I will argue that (1) testing, not development, is the 
bottleneck in the flow of knowledge about human anti-aging; (2) single 
interventions are unlikely to afford major increments in life expectancy in 
humans; (3) interactions among combinations of known anti-aging interventions 
are the most important unknown in the field; (4) the daunting number of 
combinations may be tamed by enrolling large numbers of early adopters who are 
already using diverse combinations of strategies; (5) the newest methylation 
clock, called "DNAm PhenoAge" (Levine, M., et al. (2018) Aging (Albany), 10, 
573-591) has the potential to tell us which of these people are best succeeding 
in their quest to slow the aging clock; (6) further optimization of this clock, 
specialized to the proposed application, is feasible; and (7) multivariate 
statistics can be used to efficiently identify the best combinations of known 
interventions that are already being deployed by members of the community which 
actively seeks to enhance their long-term health. The integration of these ideas 
leads to a proposal for a human trial crowd-funded largely by the subjects, 
organized around a web site, as well as standardization of individual 
record-keeping and an open-source database of methylation results before and 
after.

Comment in
    Lancet Neurol. 2019 Apr;18(4):325-326.

With over 2 million new cases annually, stroke is associated with the highest 
disability-adjusted life-years lost of any disease in China. The burden is 
expected to increase further as a result of population ageing, an ongoing high 
prevalence of risk factors (eg, hypertension), and inadequate management. 
Despite improved access to overall health services, the availability of 
specialist stroke care is variable across the country, and especially uneven in 
rural areas. In-hospital outcomes have improved because of a greater 
availability of reperfusion therapies and supportive care, but adherence to 
secondary prevention strategies and long-term care are inadequate. Thrombolysis 
and stroke units are accepted as standards of care across the world, including 
in China, but bleeding-risk concerns and organisational challenges hamper 
widespread adoption of this care in China. Despite little supporting evidence, 
Chinese herbal products and neuroprotective drugs are widely used, and the 
increased availability of neuroimaging techniques also results in overdiagnosis 
and overtreatment of so-called silent stroke. Future efforts should focus on 
providing more balanced availability of specialised stroke services across the 
country, enhancing evidence-based practice, and encouraging greater 
translational research to improve outcome of patients with stroke.

BACKGROUND: Previous analyses of democracy and population health have focused on 
broad measures, such as life expectancy at birth and child and infant mortality, 
and have shown some contradictory results. We used a panel of data spanning 170 
countries to assess the association between democracy and cause-specific 
mortality and explore the pathways connecting democratic rule to health gains.
METHODS: We extracted cause-specific mortality and HIV-free life expectancy 
estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2016 and information on regime type from the Varieties of Democracy project. 
These data cover 170 countries and 46 years. From the Financing Global Health 
database, we extracted gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, also covering 46 
years, and Development Assistance for Health estimates starting from 1990 and 
domestic health spending estimates starting from 1995. We used a diverse set of 
empirical methods-synthetic control, within-country variance decomposition, 
structural equation models, and fixed-effects regression-which together provide 
a robust analysis of the association between democratisation and population 
health.
FINDINGS: HIV-free life expectancy at age 15 years improved significantly during 
the study period (1970-2015) in countries after they transitioned to democracy, 
on average by 3% after 10 years. Democratic experience explains 22·27% of the 
variance in mortality within a country from cardiovascular diseases, 16·53% for 
tuberculosis, and 17·78% for transport injuries, and a smaller percentage for 
other diseases included in the study. For cardiovascular diseases, transport 
injuries, cancers, cirrhosis, and other non-communicable diseases, democratic 
experience explains more of the variation in mortality than GDP. Over the past 
20 years, the average country's increase in democratic experience had direct and 
indirect effects on reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease (-9·64%, 95% 
CI -6·38 to -12·90), other non-communicable diseases (-9·14%, -4·26 to -14·02), 
and tuberculosis (-8·93%, -2·08 to -15·77). Increases in a country's democratic 
experience were not correlated with GDP per capita between 1995 and 2015 
(ρ=-0·1036; p=0·1826), but were correlated with declines in mortality from 
cardiovascular disease (ρ=-0·3873; p<0·0001) and increases in government health 
spending (ρ=0·4002; p<0·0001). Removal of free and fair elections from the 
democratic experience variable resulted in loss of association with 
age-standardised mortality from non-communicable diseases and injuries.
INTERPRETATION: When enforced by free and fair elections, democracies are more 
likely than autocracies to lead to health gains for causes of mortality (eg, 
cardiovascular diseases and transport injuries) that have not been heavily 
targeted by foreign aid and require health-care delivery infrastructure. 
International health agencies and donors might increasingly need to consider the 
implications of regime type in their efforts to maximise health gains, 
particularly in the context of ageing populations and the growing burden of 
non-communicable diseases.
