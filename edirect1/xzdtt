Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a complex disease caused by genetic alterations 
in production of collagen type I, and collagen-related proteins. Bone fragility 
is the most common patient issue, but extraskeletal complications also present 
an adverse factor in the quality of life and prognosis of patients with OI. 
However, still little is known about the morbidity and mortality of these 
patients. The objective of this paper is to determine and describe to what 
extent OI impacts patients' life in terms of hospitalization and complications 
describing the incidence and prevalence of the Dutch cohort of OI patients and 
the characteristics of their hospital admissions. Information regarding OI 
patients and their hospital admission was extracted from the Statistics 
Netherlands Database and matched to the OI Genetics Database of Amsterdam UMC. 
Hospital admission data was available for 674 OI patients. This OI nationwide 
registry study shows that the life expectancy of OI patients is adversely 
affected by the disease. The median annual incidence risk of OI between 1992 and 
2019 was 6.5 per 100,000 live births. Furthermore, patients with OI had a 2.9 
times higher hospitalization rate compared to the general Dutch population. The 
highest hospitalization rate ratio of 8.4 was reported in the patient group 
between 0 and 19 years old. OI type and severity had impact on extraskeletal 
manifestations, which play a key role in the numerous hospital admissions. More 
awareness about the impact of OI on patients' life is needed to improve and 
implement prevention and follow-up guidelines.

Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary kidney disease associated with proteinuria, 
hematuria and progressive kidney failure. It is characterized by a defective 
glomerular basement membrane caused by mutations in type IV collagen genes 
COL4A3/A4/A5 which result in defective type IV collagen α3, α4, or α5 chains, 
respectively. Alport syndrome has three different patterns of inheritance: 
X-linked, autosomal and digenic. In a study of CKD of unknown etiology type IV 
collagen gene mutations accounted for the majority of the cases of hereditary 
glomerulopathies which suggests that AS is often underrecognized. The natural 
history and prognosis in patients with AS is variable and is determined by 
genetics and environmental factors. At present, no preventive or curative 
therapies exist for AS. Current treatment includes the use of 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors which slow progression of kidney 
disease and prolong life expectancy. Ramipril was found in retrospective studies 
to delay the onset of ESKD and was recently demonstrated to be safe and 
effective in children and adolescents, supporting that early initiation of Renin 
Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) blockade is very important. 
Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers might be favorable for patients who develop 
"aldosterone breakthrough." While the DAPA-CKD trial suggests a beneficial 
effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD of non-metabolic origin, only a handful of 
patients had Alport in this cohort, and therefore conclusions can't be 
extrapolated for the treatment of AS with SGLT2 inhibitors. Advances in our 
understanding on the pathogenesis of Alport syndrome has culminated in the 
development of innovative therapeutic approaches that are currently under 
investigation. We will provide a brief overview of novel therapeutic targets to 
prevent progression of kidney disease in AS. Our review will include bardoxolone 
methyl, an oral NRf2 activator; lademirsen, an anti-miRNA-21 molecule; 
sparsentan, dual endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and angiotensin 1 receptor 
inhibitor; atrasentan, oral selective ETAR inhibitor; lipid-modifying agents, 
including cholesterol efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) 
inducers, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) inhibitors and osteopontin blocking 
agents; the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine; the antiglycemic drug 
metformin and the active vitamin D analog paricalcitol. Future genomic 
therapeutic strategies such as chaperone therapy, genome editing and stem cell 
therapy will also be discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in a variety 
of vulnerable bacterial and fungal diseases. Mucormycosis is a life-threatening 
infection caused by fungi belonging to the class Zygomycetes and the order 
Mucorales. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the level of serum 
ferritin level in mucormycosis patients and to prognosticate them based on those 
values.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the 
Department of General Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, 
Tiruchirappalli, in 50 diagnosed mucormycosis patients.
RESULTS: During the study period, 44 had prior COVID-19 illness (post-COVID). 
Six patients had mucormycosis with no prior COVID-19 illness. Rhino-orbital 
involvement was found in 44 of the 50 cases, with three of them having cerebral 
extension. Forty-one cases recovered and were discharged, six cases remained 
sick and were hospitalized, and three died. The post-COVID patients (554.13 
± 371.60) have greater serum ferritin levels than non-COVID patients (259.95 ± 
110.15), which are statistically significant.  Conclusion: Mucormycosis patients 
tend to have higher serum ferritin values, especially among non-survivors and 
sick patients than survivors. For a better chance of recovery and survival, 
early identification, surgical debridement, and antifungal medications are 
essential.

BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) causes a great medical burden globally, 
and the same-day discharge (SDD) method has previously been considered to be 
cost saving. However, a standard cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to evaluated the benefits of SDD 
when performing THA from the perspective of both economic and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Eighty-four participants undergoing primary THA were randomized to 
either the SDD group or the inpatient group. Outcomes were assessed by an 
independent orthopedist who was not in the surgical team, using the Oxford Hip 
Score (OHS), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), SF-36 scores and the quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). All the cost information was also collected.
RESULTS: The mean stay of patients in the SDD group was 21.70 ± 3.45 h, while 
the inpatient group was 78.15 ± 26.36 h. This trial did not detect any 
significant differences in OHS and QALYs. The total cost in the SDD group was 
significantly lower than that in the inpatient group (¥69,771.27 ± 6,608.00 vs. 
¥80,666.17 ± 8,421.96, p < 0.001). From the perspective of total cost, when 
measuring OHS, the incremental effect was -0.12 and the incremental cost was 
-¥10,894.90. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 90,790.83. 
When measuring QALYs, the incremental effect was 0.02, and the ICER was 
negative. Sensitivity analysis produced similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: SDD has an acceptable likelihood of being more cost-effective than 
the traditional inpatient option. After conducting cost-utility analysis, SDD 
resulted in better QALYs, while significantly reducing the total cost.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a major health problem in China. Integrated 
interventions have been implemented in key areas of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and 
Shandong provinces with historically higher than average cancer mortality. 
Assessing the cancer mortality trend and its impact on life expectancy (LE) 
could help evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in these regions.
METHODS: Based on the National Cause-of-Death Surveillance, we analyzed the 
standardized mortality rate (SMR) of cancer, cause eliminated life expectancy 
(CELE), potential gains in life expectancy (PGLEs), and rate of life lost in key 
areas of 4 provinces from 2008 to 2018. Joinpoint program was used to compute 
the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of cancer mortality. Arriaga's 
decomposition method was used to estimate the contribution of cancer to LE in 
each age group.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2018, cancer SMR decreased in the study region 
(AAPC=-3.09%, P<0.001), which increased LE. The positive effect was the greatest 
in the 75-79 age group (0.120 years, 2.90%), and the negative effect was the 
greatest in the 50-54 age group (-0.094 years, -2.20%). Compared to 2008, cancer 
CELE increased by 3.95 years, PGLEs increased by 0.32 years, and rate of life 
lost increased by 0.21% in 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer SMR decreased in key areas of 4 provinces from 2008 to 2018. 
This change had a positive effect on the increase of LE. However, the rate of 
life lost due to cancer increased. Integrated interventions should continue to 
further reduce the cancer burden.

Few studies have analyzed mortality rates among transgender (trans) populations 
in the United States and compared them to the rates of non-trans populations. 
Using private insurance data from 2011 to 2019, we estimated age-specific 
all-cause mortality rates among a subset of trans people enrolled in private 
insurance and compared them to a 10% randomly selected non-trans cohort. 
Overall, we found that trans people were nearly twice as likely to die over the 
period as their non-trans counterparts. When stratifying by gender, we found key 
disparities within trans populations, with people on the trans feminine to 
nonbinary spectrum being at the greatest risk of mortality compared to non-trans 
males and females. While we found that people on the trans masculine to 
nonbinary spectrum were at a similar risk of overall mortality compared to 
non-trans females, their overall mortality rate was statistically smaller than 
that of non-trans males. These findings provide evidence that some trans and 
non-trans populations experience substantially different mortality conditions 
across the life course and necessitate further study.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation of quantitative Duplex ultrasound (DUS) and 
strain gauge plethysmography (SGP) parameters with clinical severity and quality 
of life in patients with superficial venous incompetence.
METHODS: DUS volume flow and distal SGP refilling times (T50 and T90) were 
evaluated in 152 patients (164 Limbs) with superficial incompetence. Clinical 
severity and quality of life were evaluated with C of the CEAP classification, 
venous clinical severity score (VCSS), Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire 
(AVVQ), and EuroQol 5D-3L.
RESULTS: Higher DUS volume flow was associated with higher C in CEAP scores. 
Volume flow was also related to T50 and T90. Shorter T50 and T90 were associated 
with higher C in CEAP and VCSS. T50 was also associated with EQ-5DVAS. Reflux 
extension to the foot wase associated with shorter T50 and T90 and higher DUS 
volume flow.
CONCLUSIONS: DUS volume flow and SGP refilling times are related with clinical 
severity and provide quantitative information regarding venous function in 
patients with superficial incompetence.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is useful to assess the value of 
health care interventions based on clinical effectiveness and costs. However, 
standard CEA methods make important assumptions that may significantly increase 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for lifelong treatments for 
rare, chronic diseases. We used the cost-effectiveness of 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis as a case study to explore how alternative assumptions for 
(1) discounting, (2) utility measures, (3) disease management costs, and (4) 
static drug pricing impact cost-effectiveness outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of ELX/TEZ/IVA was evaluated using 
base-case inputs and assumptions reflecting standard CEA methods and was then 
compared with cost-effectiveness estimates obtained with alternate assumptions: 
(1) applying a lower discount rate to health benefits (1.5%) than costs (3%); 
(2) including a treatment-specific utility increment; (3) excluding disease 
management costs incurred during the period of extended survival attributable to 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment; and (4) decreasing the price of ELX/TEZ/IVA following 
loss of exclusivity.
RESULTS: Modifying assumptions for these four factors together reduced the ICER 
by 75% from the base case, with the largest reduction (45%) occurring when the 
price trajectory was modified to allow for generic entry. Differential 
discounting, use of a treatment-specific utility increment, and exclusion of 
additional disease management costs each individually reduced the ICER by 36%, 
14%, and 10%, respectively, from the base case.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the impact that modifications to standard 
CEA methods may have on measures of cost-effectiveness for rare, chronic 
diseases.

This review article depicts the possible replacement of staple cereal sources 
with some pseudocereals like Chia, Quinoa, Buckwheat, and Amaranth, which not 
only provide recommended daily allowance of all nutrients but also help to 
reduce the chances of many non-communicable infections owing to the presence of 
several bioactive compounds. These pseudocereals are neglected plant seeds and 
should be added in our routine diet. Besides, they can serve as nutraceuticals 
in combating various diseases by improving the health status of the consumers. 
The bioactive compounds like rutin, quercetin, peptide chains, angiotensin I, 
and many other antioxidants present in these plant seeds help to reduce the 
oxidative stress in the body which leads toward better health of the consumers. 
All these pseudocereals have high quantity of soluble fiber which helps to 
regulate bowel movement, control hypercholesterolemia (presence of high plasma 
cholesterol levels), hypertension (high blood pressure), and cardiovascular 
diseases. The ultimate result of consumption of pseudocereals either as a whole 
or in combination with true cereals as staple food may help to retain the 
integrity of the human body which increases the life expectancy by slowing down 
the aging process.

Every public health expenditure, including the one that saves lives or extends 
life expectancy of particular persons (target population), bears a cost. 
Although cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is routinely performed in health 
policy, ethical justification of CEA is rarely discussed. Also, there is neither 
consensus value nor even consensus method for determining cost-effectiveness 
threshold (CET) for life-extending measures. In this study, we performed ethical 
analysis of CEA by policy impact assessment based on connection of health and 
wealth (poorer people have statistically shorter life expectancies) and 
concluded that CEA is not only a practical but also an ethical necessity. To 
quantify CET, we used three independent methods: (1) literature survey of 
analyzing salaries in risky occupations, (2) utilizing Prospect Theory 
suggesting that people value their lives in monetary terms twice more than their 
lifetime earnings, and (3) literature survey of the U.S. current legal practice. 
To the best of our knowledge, nobody applied method (2) to determine CET. The 
three methods yielded rather similar results with CET about 1.0 ± 0.4 gross 
domestic product per capita (GDPpc) per quality-adjusted life-year. Therefore, a 
sum of not higher than 140% GDPpc is statistically sufficient to "purchase" an 
additional year of life-or, alternatively, to "rob" one year of life if taken 
away. Therefore, 140% GDP per capita per quality-adjusted life-year should be 
considered as the upper limit of prudent and ethically justified expenditure on 
life extension programs.

BACKGROUND: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) was originally indicated for 
older adults, but outcomes in the oldest patients have not been studied. The 
purpose of this study was to report on patients aged ≥85 years undergoing RSA. 
We hypothesized that RSA would be safe, effective, and durable.
METHODS: Sixty-one RSAs were performed in 58 patients aged ≥85 years (16 
patients aged ≥90 years); 40 RSAs were performed for arthritis with cuff 
deficiency, 14 were performed for proximal humeral fractures, and 7 were 
performed as revisions. Active range of motion and patient-reported outcomes, 
comprising the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test 
score, and visual analog scale pain score, were obtained preoperatively and at 
final follow-up. Hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and 
complications were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was computed with 
revision surgery or death as an endpoint.
RESULTS: The mean age at RSA was 88.0 years. Mean forward elevation improved 
from 50.5° to 105.3°; abduction, from 48.7° to 96.1°; and external rotation, 
from 10.2° to 26.9° (P < .001 for all). Similarly, at a mean follow-up of 2.4 
years, the visual analog scale pain score improved from 6.1 to 0.6; Simple 
Shoulder Test score, from 2.2 to 7.0; and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons 
score, from 33.6 to 78.2 (P < .001 for all). The mean length of stay was 3.6 
days, and 15 patients were discharged home. Seven patients received a blood 
transfusion, and only 2 patients underwent a reoperation, neither of whom 
required explantation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Improvements in active range of motion and 
patient-reported outcomes in our patients were comparable to those observed in 
younger cohorts and exceeded published minimal clinically important differences 
for most patients undergoing RSA for cuff deficiency. Additionally, to date, the 
patients in our study who died had lived with their RSA for a mean of 3.4 years 
and living patients had lived with their RSA for a mean of 4.3 years. RSA in 
patients aged ≥85 years is safe, effective, and durable for their remaining life 
expectancy. This information may help counsel older patients who are considering 
RSA, electively or for fractures.

Primary ventricular fibrillation (PVF) is a life-threatening complication of 
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is unclear what roles 
viral infection and/or systemic inflammation may play as underlying triggers of 
PVF, as a second hit in the context of acute ischaemia. Here we aimed to 
evaluate whether the circulating virome and inflammatory proteome were 
associated with PVF development in patients with STEMI. Blood samples were 
obtained from non-PVF and PVF STEMI patients at the time of primary PCI, and 
from non-STEMI healthy controls. The virome profile was analysed using 
VirCapSeq-VERT (Virome Capture Sequencing Platform for Vertebrate Viruses), a 
sequencing platform targeting viral taxa of 342,438 representative sequences, 
spanning all virus sequence records. The inflammatory proteome was explored with 
the Olink inflammation panel, using the Proximity Extension Assay technology. 
After analysing all viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans, we 
found that non-PVF and PVF patients only significantly differed in the 
frequencies of viruses in the Gamma-herpesvirinae and Anelloviridae families. In 
particular, most showed a significantly higher relative frequency in non-PVF 
STEMI controls. Analysis of systemic inflammation revealed no significant 
differences between the inflammatory profiles of non-PVF and PVF STEMI patients. 
Inflammatory proteins associated with cell adhesion, chemotaxis, cellular 
response to cytokine stimulus, and cell activation proteins involved in immune 
response (IL6, IL8 CXCL-11, CCL-11, MCP3, MCP4, and ENRAGE) were significantly 
higher in STEMI patients than non-STEMI controls. CDCP1 and IL18-R1 were 
significantly higher in PVF patients compared to healthy subjects, but not 
compared to non-PVF patients. The circulating virome and systemic inflammation 
were not associated with increased risk of PVF development in acute STEMI. 
Accordingly, novel strategies are needed to elucidate putative triggers of PVF 
in the setting of acute ischaemia, in order to reduce STEMI-driven sudden death 
burden.

In agriculture, horticulture and plantation forestry, Bacillus species are the 
most commonly applied antagonists and biopesticides, targeting plant pathogens 
and insect pests, respectively. Bacillus isolates are also used as bacterial 
plant biostimulants, or BPBs. Such useful isolates of Bacillus are typically 
sourced from soil. Here, we show that Bacillus - and other antagonistic microbes 
- can be sourced from a broad range of plant seeds. We found that culturable 
Bacillus isolates are common in the seeds of 98 plant species representing 39 
families (i.e., 87% of the commonly cultured bacteria belonged to Bacillales). 
We also found that 83% of the commonly cultured fungi from the seeds of the 98 
plant species belonged to just three orders of fungi-Pleosporales, Hypocreales 
and Eurotiales-that are also associated with antagonism. Furthermore, we 
confirmed antagonism potential in agaro with seed isolates of Bacillus from 
Pinus monticola as a representative case. Eight isolates each of seed Bacillus, 
seed fungi, and foliar fungi, all from P. monticola, were paired in a total of 
384 possible pair-wise interactions (with seed and foliar fungi as the targets). 
Seed Bacillus spp. were the strongest antagonists of the seed and foliar fungi, 
with a mean interaction strength 2.8 times greater than seed fungi (all either 
Eurotiales or Hypocreales) and 3.2 times greater than needle fungi. Overall, our 
study demonstrates that seeds host a taxonomically narrow group of culturable, 
antagonistic bacteria and fungi.

INTRODUCTION: Failure to incorporate key patient-reported outcome (PRO) content 
in trial protocols affects the quality and interpretability of the collected 
data, contributing to research waste. Our group developed evidence-based 
training specifically addressing PRO components of protocols. We aimed to assess 
whether 2-day educational workshops improved the PRO completeness of protocols 
against consensus-based minimum standards provided in the SPIRIT-PRO Extension 
in 2018.
METHOD: Annual workshops were conducted 2011-2017. Participants were 
investigators/trialists from cancer clinical trials groups. Although developed 
before 2018, workshops covered 15/16 SPIRIT-PRO items. Participant feedback 
immediately post-workshop and, retrospectively, in November 2017 was summarised 
descriptively. Protocols were evaluated against SPIRIT-PRO by two independent 
raters for workshop protocols (developed post-workshop by participants) and 
control protocols (contemporaneous non-workshop protocols). SPIRIT-PRO items 
were assessed for completeness (0 = not addressed, 10 = fully addressed). 
Mann-Whitney U tests assessed whether workshop protocols scored higher than 
controls by item and overall.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 107) evaluated the workshop positively. In 2017, 
16/41 survey responders (39%) reported never applying in practice; barriers 
included role restrictions (14/41, 34%) and lack of time (5/41, 12%). SPIRIT-PRO 
overall scores did not differ between workshop (n = 13, median = 3.81/10, 
interquartile range = 3.24) and control protocols (n = 9, 3.51/10 (2.14)), 
(p = 0.35). Workshop protocols scored higher than controls on two items: 
'specify PRO concepts/domains' (p = 0.05); 'methods for handling missing data' 
(p = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: Although participants were highly satisfied with these workshops, 
the completeness of PRO protocol content generally did not improve. Additional 
knowledge translation efforts are needed to assist protocol writers address 
SPIRIT-PRO guidance and avoid research waste that may eventuate from sub-optimal 
PRO protocol content.

INTRODUCTION: Novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist oral 
semaglutide has demonstrated greater improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
and body weight versus oral medications empagliflozin and sitagliptin, and 
injectable GLP-1 analog liraglutide, in the PIONEER clinical trial program. 
Based on these data, the present analysis aimed to evaluate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin, sitagliptin and 
liraglutide in Spain.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patients' lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model (v9.0), discounted at 3.0% annually. Cohort characteristics and 
treatment effects were sourced from PIONEER 2 and 4 for the comparisons of oral 
semaglutide 14 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg and liraglutide 1.8 mg, 
respectively, and PIONEER 3 for oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg versus sitagliptin 
100 mg. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective in 2020 euros 
(EUR). Patients were assumed to receive initial therapies until HbA1c exceeded 
7.5% and then treatment-intensified to basal insulin.
RESULTS: Oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.13, 0.19 and 0.06 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) versus empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and liraglutide 
1.8 mg, respectively, with direct costs EUR 168 higher versus empagliflozin and 
EUR 236 and 1415 lower versus sitagliptin and liraglutide, respectively. Oral 
semaglutide 14 mg was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of EUR 1339 per QALY gained versus empagliflozin and was considered 
dominant (clinically superior and cost saving) versus sitagliptin and 
liraglutide. Additional analyses demonstrated that oral semaglutide 7 mg was 
associated with improvements of 0.11 QALYs and increased costs of EUR 226 versus 
sitagliptin and was therefore associated with an ICER of EUR 2011 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: Oral semaglutide 14 mg was dominant versus sitagliptin and 
liraglutide, and cost-effective versus empagliflozin, for the treatment of type 
2 diabetes in Spain.

The short-term effects of particulate matter (PM) on years of life lost (YLL) 
have been confirmed by several studies; however, little attention has been paid 
to the effects of PM on life expectancy from respiratory diseases (RD), 
especially at the city level. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to 
assess the associations between daily PM and YLL of the RD and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) in Tianjin from 2015 to 2019. Then the 
daily avoidable YLL, attributable fraction, and potential life expectancy 
benefits (PLEB) of RD and COPD by reducing the daily concentration of PM2.5 and 
PM10 to attain the Chinese and World Health Organization (WHO) air quality 
standard targets were estimated during 2015-2019. The stratified analyses by 
gender were also conducted. A total of 18279 RD and 7767 COPD deaths were 
included in this study. Per 10 μg/m3 increments in PM2.5 and PM10 at lag1 were 
significantly associated with 0.83(95%CI: 0.11, 1.55) years and 0.57(95%CI: 
0.06, 1.08) years increasing in YLL of total RD and 0.48 (95%CI: 0.07, 0.90) 
years and 0.30 (95%CI: 0.01, 0.60) years increasing in YLL of total COPD. If the 
daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations decreased to attain the Chinese and WHO air 
quality standard targets, 0.06-0.39 years PLEB due to total RD and 
0.08-0.53 years PLEB due to COPD could be gained. And more PLEB on RD could be 
gained by decreasing the daily PM concentrations to attain the WHO air quality 
standard targets than that of attaining the Chinese air quality standard 
targets. These evidence-based findings emphasize the importance of the Chinese 
PM-related guideline updating and may have implications for PM-related 
policy-making.

BACKGROUND: The last economic evaluation of pathogen reduction technology (PRT) 
in Canada was conducted in 2007. We reassessed the cost-effectiveness of PRT in 
the province of Québec (which has its own blood supplier) and included an 
evaluation of the potential impact of emerging pathogens on cost-effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Decision analytic Markov models were developed to 
simulate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) associated with PRT as 
an addition to existing safety measures for plasma and platelet products (except 
for bacterial culture). Models accounted for several infectious and 
noninfectious transfusion reactions, recipients' productivity losses ensuing 
from these reactions, and the impact of PRT on platelet function. Scenario 
analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of a new highly contagious human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-like or West Nile virus (WNV)-like pathogen, 
assuming various epidemiological scenarios.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
PRT was estimated at $8,088,974/QALY gained. Assuming the presence of an 
HIV-like pathogen, the ICER was $265,209/QALY gained in the "average 
transmission" scenario, $1,274,445/QALY gained in the "rapid testing scenario," 
and $123,063/QALY gained in the "highly contagious" scenario. Assuming the 
presence of a WNV-like pathogen, the ICER was $7,469,167/QALY gained in the 
"average transmission" scenario and $6,652,769/QALY gained in the "highly 
contagious" scenario.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of PRT may substantially improve in the event 
of a new, blood-borne pathogen. Given their significant impact on 
cost-effectiveness, the emergence of new pathogens should be considered when 
deciding whether to adopt PRT.

BACKGROUND: Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience 
health and socioeconomic disparities, including lower life-expectancy, have a 
younger mean age of colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis, and lower CRC survival 
than non-Indigenous Australians. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program 
(NBCSP) provides biennial CRC screening for Australians aged 50-74 years to 
reduce the burden of CRC. The 2019 participation rate was 42% nationwide and 23% 
in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. For Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples, this study aims to estimate the health outcomes and 
cost-effectiveness of the current NBCSP and extensions to include people < 50 
years.
METHODS: An existing microsimulation model, Policy1-Bowel, was adapted to the 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population and was used to evaluate three 
strategies assuming biennial iFOBT screening from 50-74, 45-74, or 40-74 years 
under two participation scenarios: 23% and 42% per screening round (psr.).
