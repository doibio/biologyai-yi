Objective: To analyze the level and trend of occupational pneumoconiosis disease 
burden in Tianjin from 2010 to 2019, and to provide scientific basis for making 
prevention and control countermeasures and suggestions. Methods: In June 2021, 
the data of occupational pneumoconiosis cases in Tianjin from 2010 to 2019 were 
selected from Follow-up survey of occupational pneumoconiosis patients in 
Tianjin and occupational "Health Hazardous Surveillance Information System", the 
subsystem of China Disease Control and Prevention Information System. 
Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) , years of life lost (YLL) and years lost 
due to disability (YLD) were used to comprehensively measure the disease burden 
of occupational pneumoconiosis by region, year, disease type, industry, sex and 
age; Kruskal-wallis H test was used for univariate analysis of DALY loss in 
pneumdo-niosis occupational. Results: A total of 43089 person-years of DALY due 
to pneumoconiosis in Tianjin from 2010 to 2019, of which the YLD accounted for 
about 2/3 (28277 person-years) , the YLL accounted for about 1/3 (14812 
person-years) , and the average DALY was 7.34 person-years. The industrial 
distribution of pneumoconiosis burden in Tianjin was mainly concentrated in the 
manufacturing industry accounting for 90.6% of the whole industry. The disease 
types were mainly concentrated in silicosis, foundry pneumoconiosis, asbestosis 
and cement pneumoconiosis accounting for 34.4%, 16.9%, 13.3% and 10.5%, and the 
age distribution was mainly concentrated in the 50~<85 years old age group, 
accouling for 83.6%. The median DALY of occupational pneumoconiosis patients 
with different pneumoconiosis stages, disability grades and years of service 
exposed to dust were statistically significant (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The 
disease burden of occupational pneumoconiosis in Tianjin was still serious. It 
is necessary to take targeted intervention measures for key industries and 
population.

Publisher: 目的： 分析2010至2019年天津市职业性尘肺病疾病负担水平及其变化趋势，为制定尘肺病防控对策和建议提供科学依据。 方法： 
于2021年6月，从天津市职业性尘肺病患者随访调查资料和《中国疾病预防控制信息系统》子系统《健康危害监测信息系统》中选取天津市2010至2019年职业性尘肺病个案资料，用伤残调整寿命年（DALY）、早死所致的寿命损失年（YLL）和伤残所致的健康寿命损失年（YLD）指标，按地区、年份、病种、行业、性别和年龄全面衡量职业性尘肺病疾病负担；采用Kruskal-wollis 
H检验对职业性尘肺病DALY进行单因素分析。 结果： 2010至2019年天津市职业性尘肺病共造成DALY 43 089人年，其中YLD约占2/3（28 
277人年），YLL约占1/3（14 
812人年），人均DALY为7.34人年；天津市职业性尘肺病疾病负担行业分布主要集中在加工制造业，占全行业的90.6%，病种分布主要集中在矽肺、铸工尘肺、石棉肺和水泥尘肺分别占34.4%、16.9%、13.3%和10.5%，年龄分布主要集中在50~<85岁年龄段，占83.6%；不同尘肺病分期、伤残等级、接尘工龄的尘肺病人均DALY中位数差异均有统计学意义（P<0.05）。 
结论： 天津市职业性尘肺病疾病负担依然严重，应针对重点行业和人群采取针对性的干预措施。.

Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with relevant 
social and economic burden on global healthcare system. Although the development 
of novel diagnostic tools and the advance in therapies have deeply influenced 
the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, improving both prognosis and life 
expectancy of patients, hospitalization is still high, and mortality remains 
considerable. MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNA molecules that 
post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in both physiological and 
pathological processes. In recent years, microRNA have arisen as attractive 
therapeutic targets in the treatment of a wide spectrum of pathologies, 
including heart failure. In cardiac pathology, deregulation of microRNAs 
expression and function is associated to adverse outcome and heart failure 
progression. Circulating levels of specific microRNAs have emerged as useful 
biomarkers for the diagnosis of heart failure or as prognostic indicators. In 
the present review, we summarize the state of current research on the role of 
miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with heart failure 
and their use as potential therapeutic targets for this condition.

    Eur Heart J. 2022 Dec 02;:

AIMS: Previous studies on the cost-effectiveness of screening for atrial 
fibrillation (AF) are based on assumptions of long-term clinical effects. The 
STROKESTOP study, which randomised 27 975 persons aged 75/76 years into a 
screening invitation group and a control group, has a median follow-up time of 
6.9 years. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
population-based screening for AF using clinical outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis is based on a Markov cohort model. The 
prevalence of AF, the use of oral anticoagulation, clinical event data, and 
all-cause mortality were taken from the STROKESTOP study. The cost for clinical 
events, age-specific utilities, utility decrement due to stroke, and stroke 
death was taken from the literature. Uncertainty in the model was considered in 
a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Per 1000 individuals invited to the 
screening, there were 77 gained life years and 65 gained quality-adjusted life 
years. The incremental cost was €1.77 million lower in the screening invitation 
group. Gained quality-adjusted life years to a lower cost means that the 
screening strategy was dominant. The result from 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations 
showed that the AF screening strategy was cost-effective in 99.2% and 
cost-saving in 92.7% of the simulations. In the base-case scenario, screening of 
1000 individuals resulted in 10.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): -22.5 to 1.4] 
fewer strokes (8.4 ischaemic and 2.2 haemorrhagic strokes), 1.0 (95% CI: -1.9 to 
4.1) more cases of systemic embolism, and 2.9 (95% CI: -18.2 to 13.1) fewer 
bleedings associated with hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Based on the STROKESTOP study, this analysis shows that a broad AF 
screening strategy in an elderly population is cost-effective. Efforts should be 
made to increase screening participation.

BACKGROUND: .Summary measures such as disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are 
becoming increasingly important for the standardized assessment of the burden of 
disease due to death and disability. The BURDEN 2020 pilot project was designed 
as an independent burden-of-disease study for Germany, which was based on 
nationwide data, but which also yielded regional estimates.
METHODS: DALY is defined as the sum of years of life lost due to death (YLL) and 
years lived with disability (YLD). YLL is the difference between the age at 
death due to disease and the remaining life expectancy at this age, while YLD 
quantifies the number of years individuals have spent with health impairments. 
Data are derived mainly from causes of death statistics, population health 
surveys, and claims data from health insurers.
RESULTS: In 2017, there were approximately 12 million DALY in Germany, or 14 584 
DALY per 100 000 inhabitants. Conditions which caused the greatest number of 
DALY were coronary heart disease (2321 DALY), low back pain (1735 DALY), and 
lung cancer (1197 DALY). Headache and dementia accounted for a greater disease 
burden in women than in men, while lung cancer and alcohol use disorders 
accounted for a greater disease burden in men than in women. Pain disorders and 
alcohol use disorders were the leading causes of DALY among young adults of both 
sexes. The disease burden rose with age for some diseases, including 
cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and diabetes mellitus. For some diseases and 
conditions, the disease burden varied by geographical region.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for age- and sex-specific prevention and 
for differing interventions according to geographic region. Burden of disease 
studies yield comprehensive population health surveillance data and are a useful 
aid to decision-making in health policy.

Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Neuromuscular Joint 
Facilitation on Upper Limb Motor Disorders for Stroke Patients.

Guo L, Xu S, Zhang Y, Xi W, Kang R.

CONTEXT: Approximately 1.5- to 2-million new patients suffer from stroke 
annually in China. 60% of patients suffering from stroke will sustain different 
degrees of upper limb dysfunction at six months after onset. Recovery of upper 
limb function after stroke is of great significance in improving patients' 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to explore the rehabilitative the effects of 
transcranial direct current stimulation combined with neuromuscular joint 
therapy on the rehabilitation of patients with upper-limb motor disorders after 
strokes to provide new ideas for rehabilitative treatment.
DESIGN: The study was a paired control test.
SETTING: The study took place in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at 
Heping Hospital of Changzhi Medical College in Changzhi, Shanxi, China.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 80 stroke patients with upper-limb motor 
disorders who were treated at the hospital between January 2020 and December 
2020.
INTERVENTION: According to the natural grouping method, the research team 
divided participants into an intervention group (n = 42) and a control group (n 
= 38). The control group received transcranial direct-current stimulation, and 
the intervention group received transcranial direct-current stimulation combined 
with neuromuscular joint therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The measurements included the scores on the Fugl-Meyer 
Assessment (FMA) scale, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), activities of daily 
living (ADL), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as well as 
the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth 
factor (NGF), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The team also measured the maximum 
isometric torque of flexion and extension of the elbow joint. The research team 
compared the differences in the scores between the groups for all variables.
RESULTS: Postintervention, the FMA, ARAT, and ADL scores, the torques of elbow 
flexion and extension maximum isometric contraction, the amplitude, and the 
serum BDNF, NGF, and SOD levels were significantly higher in the intervention 
group than those in the control group, while the NIHSS score and the incubation 
period of evoked potential were significantly lower than those in the control 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial direct current stimulation combined with the 
neuromuscular joint method demonstrated good rehabilitative effects on 
upper-limb movement disorders for stroke patients and significantly improved 
their upper-limb function and promoted recovery of nerve functions.

PURPOSE: We aimed to estimate the incidence, prevalence and years lived with 
disability (YLDs) of spinal cord injury (SCI) in China in 2019 and temporal 
trends from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 was used to obtain data. 
Outcome measures included age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), prevalence 
rate (ASPR) and YLDs rate (ASYR). A Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 
2.1, was used to produce the estimates of each value after adjustments.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 234.19 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
171.84-312.87] thousand incident cases of SCI in China, with an ASIR of 13.87 
(95% UI 10.15-18.66) per 100,000. ASIR and ASYR increased by 40.81% (95% UI 
32.92-49.14%) and 11.44% (95% UI 5.16-17.29%) compared with 1990, individually. 
Males had higher ASIR and ASYR in each year from 1990 to 2019, but the incidence 
and YLDs rates of females exceeded males after 70 years old. Incidence and YLDs 
rates both ascended with age. SCI at neck level had slightly higher incidence 
rate but much higher YLDs rate than that below neck level. The average incidence 
age increased from 38.97 in 1990 to 54.59 in 2019. Falls were the leading cause 
of SCI.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and burden of SCI in China increased significantly 
during the past three decades. The age structure of SCI patients showed a shift 
from the young to the elderly as population aging. Urgent efforts are needed to 
relieve the health pressure from SCI.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence from non-randomized studies shows benefits for 
single-inhaler users compared with multiple-inhaler users who receive the same 
medication. As a result, comparative cost-effectiveness studies are required to 
inform treatment decisions with an increasing choice of medications and devices 
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study conducted a 
systematic literature review to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using a 
single combination inhaler regimen for patients with severe COPD. This review 
also investigated the health impact on patients in different settings.
AREAS COVERED: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), 
EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EBSCO Host (including CINAHL 
and EconLit), Health Technology Assessment Database, National Institute for 
Health Research Economic Evaluation Database, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
Registry and Google Scholar.
EXPERT OPINION: Based on the primary findings of 13 included studies: (1) 
single-inhaler triple therapy was a cost-effective treatment option for patients 
with severe COPD, and (2) triple therapy also resulted in better health outcomes 
(reduced exacerbations, life-years gained) and increased QALYs for patients with 
severe COPD. Nonetheless, eleven out of the thirteen selected studies were 
funded by the pharmaceutical industry, and none were conducted in the least 
developed countries. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.

The aphid Melanaphis sorghi (Theobald) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), which infest the 
sorghum crop, has been an economically important pest which have been causing 
severe damage to sorghum crops in Brazil since 2019. These species have been 
observed mainly at the end of vegetative stage and beginning of reproductive 
stage of plants. Their high reproductive rate on sorghum raises concerns about 
these pests. Therefore, the present study aimed to estimate the life expectancy 
and fertility tables of Melanaphis sorghi fed on 15 hybrids of grain sorghum, in 
order to know the resistance characteristics of these materials and understand 
how plant resistance can help manage this insect. This study was carried out in 
a laboratory at 26±2 ºC and 60±10% R.H (relative humidity). Fifty insects were 
kept in each hybrid, each insect was considered one repetition. According to 
biological parameters and fertility life table, hybrids BRS373, DKB590 and 50A10 
were less suitable for the sugarcane aphid multiplication. Thus, these hybrids 
could be useful to manage this pest, since the population growth speed is one of 
the worst problems for the implementation of cropping systems. Genotypes AG1090, 
MSK327 and XGN1305 favored the development of this pest and, when chosen within 
a cropping system, other management strategies should be considered.

Some chronic respiratory diseases can cause hypoxemia and, in such cases, 
long-term home oxygen therapy (LTOT) is indicated as a treatment option 
primarily to improve patient quality of life and life expectancy. Home oxygen 
has been used for more than 70 years, and support for LTOT is based on two 
studies from the 1980s that demonstrated that oxygen use improves survival in 
patients with COPD. There is evidence that LTOT has other beneficial effects 
such as improved cognitive function, improved exercise capacity, and reduced 
hospitalizations. LTOT is indicated in other respiratory diseases that cause 
hypoxemia, on the basis of the same criteria as those used for COPD. There has 
been an increase in the use of LTOT, probably because of increased life 
expectancy and a higher prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, as well as 
greater availability of LTOT in the health care system. The first Brazilian 
Thoracic Association consensus statement on LTOT was published in 2000. 
Twenty-two years later, we present this updated version. This document is a 
nonsystematic review of the literature, conducted by pulmonologists who 
evaluated scientific evidence and international guidelines on LTOT in the 
various diseases that cause hypoxemia and in specific situations (i.e., 
exercise, sleep, and air travel). These recommendations, produced with a view to 
clinical practice, contain several charts with information on indications for 
LTOT, oxygen sources, accessories, strategies for improved efficiency and 
effectiveness, and recommendations for the safe use of LTOT, as well as a LTOT 
prescribing model.

Algumas doenças respiratórias crônicas podem evoluir com hipoxemia e, nessas 
situações, a oxigenoterapia domiciliar prolongada (ODP) está indicada como opção 
terapêutica com o objetivo principal de melhorar a qualidade e a expectativa de 
vida desses pacientes. O oxigênio domiciliar é usado há mais de 70 anos, e a ODP 
tem como base dois estudos da década de oitenta que demonstraram que o uso de 
oxigênio melhora a sobrevida de pacientes com DPOC. Existem evidências de que a 
ODP tem outros efeitos benéficos como melhora da função cognitiva e da 
capacidade de exercício e redução de hospitalizações. A ODP está indicada para 
outras doenças respiratórias que cursam com hipoxemia, segundo os mesmos 
critérios estabelecidos para a DPOC. Tem sido observado aumento no uso da ODP 
provavelmente pela maior expectativa de vida, maior prevalência de doenças 
respiratórias crônicas e maior disponibilidade de ODP no sistema de saúde. O 
primeiro consenso sobre ODP da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia 
foi publicado em 2000; após 22 anos, apresentamos esta versão atualizada. Este 
documento é uma revisão não sistemática da literatura, realizada por 
pneumologistas que avaliaram evidências científicas e diretrizes internacionais 
sobre ODP nas diversas doenças que cursam com hipoxemia e em situações 
específicas (exercício, sono e viagens aéreas). Estas recomendações, tendo em 
vista a prática clínica, oferecem diversos quadros com informações sobre 
indicações, fontes de oxigênio, acessórios e estratégias para melhor eficiência, 
efetividade e uso seguro da ODP, assim como um modelo para sua prescrição.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a wasting syndrome drastically 
reducing efficacy of chemotherapy and life expectancy of patients. CAC affects 
up to 80% of cancer patients, yet the mechanisms underlying the disease are not 
well understood and no approved disease-specific medication exists. As a 
multiorgan disorder, CAC can only be studied on an organismal level. To cover 
the diverse aetiologies of CAC, researchers rely on the availability of a 
multifaceted pool of cancer models with varying degrees of cachexia symptoms. So 
far, no tumour model syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice exists that allows direct 
comparison between cachexigenic- and non-cachexigenic tumours.
METHODS: MCA207 and CHX207 fibrosarcoma cells were intramuscularly implanted 
into male or female, 10-11-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Tumour tissues were subjected 
to magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemical-, and transcriptomic 
analysis. Mice were analysed for tumour growth, body weight and -composition, 
food- and water intake, locomotor activity, O2 consumption, CO2 production, 
circulating blood cells, metabolites, and tumourkines. Mice were sacrificed with 
same tumour weights in all groups. Adipose tissues were examined using 
high-resolution respirometry, lipolysis measurements in vitro and ex vivo, and 
radioactive tracer studies in vivo. Gene expression was determined in adipose- 
and muscle tissues by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analyses. Muscles 
and cultured myotubes were analysed histologically and by immunofluorescence 
microscopy for myofibre cross sectional area and myofibre diameter, 
respectively. Interleukin-6 (Il-6) was deleted from cancer cells using 
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing.
RESULTS: CHX207, but not MCA207-tumour-bearing mice exhibited major clinical 
features of CAC, including systemic inflammation, increased plasma IL-6 
concentrations (190 pg/mL, P ≤ 0.0001), increased energy expenditure (+28%, 
P ≤ 0.01), adipose tissue loss (-47%, P ≤ 0.0001), skeletal muscle wasting 
(-18%, P ≤ 0.001), and body weight reduction (-13%, P ≤ 0.01) 13 days after 
cancer cell inoculation. Adipose tissue loss resulted from reduced lipid uptake 
and -synthesis combined with increased lipolysis but was not associated with 
elevated beta-adrenergic signalling or adipose tissue browning. Muscle atrophy 
was evident by reduced myofibre cross sectional area (-21.8%, P ≤ 0.001), 
increased catabolic- and reduced anabolic signalling. Deletion of IL-6 from 
CHX207 cancer cells completely protected CHX207IL6KO -tumour-bearing mice from 
CAC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present CHX207 fibrosarcoma cells as a novel tool 
to investigate the mediators and metabolic consequences of CAC in C57BL/6 mice 
in comparison to non-cachectic MCA207-tumour-bearing mice. IL-6 represents an 
essential trigger for CAC development in CHX207-tumour-bearing mice.

Acrogeria is a rare disorder that is characterized by premature aging of the 
distal extremities. It was first described by Gottron in 1941. Only about 50 
cases have yet been reported worldwide. It is diagnosed clinically, and patients 
have a normal life expectancy. The disorder is seen from birth and could have an 
autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. The classic features include a 
characteristic pinched face, thin lips, fine hair, skeletal defects, and thin, 
taut parchment-like skin of the extremities. We describe a case of Acrogeria, 
Gottron type, who also had a borderline personality disorder. However, there is 
very little information on the prevalence of psychopathology in patients having 
syndromes of premature aging.

BACKGROUND: Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the gold standard for the treatment of 
stage cT1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the increasing incidence of RCC 
in the elderly population calls for alternative minimally invasive treatments to 
reduce the negative effects on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
and subsequent healthy life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare short-term HRQoL and self-reported health 
status after PN and percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) of patients treated for RCC 
stage cT1.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent PN or PCA between 2019 
and 2021 for RCC stage cT1 at two university hospitals in Denmark were assessed. 
The exclusion criteria included insufficient understanding of the Danish 
language, dementia, metastatic RCC, conversion to nephrectomy, and salvage 
procedures.
INTERVENTION: PN and PCA.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The European Organisation for the 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire was distributed 
before treatment, and 14 and 90 d postoperatively. A linear mixed-effect model 
was used to analyze the changes from baseline to follow-up between PN and PCA 
treatment.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The cohort included 165 patients (PN: 79; PCA: 86). The 
completion rate was 96-98%. Patients receiving PCA were significantly older 
(median 69.1 vs 62.1 yr) and had lower scores on physical (p < 0.001) and role 
functioning (p = 0.009) than PN. A statistically significant change from 
baseline to 14 d was found for several HRQoL scales, which favored PCA over PN. 
However, the observed change was no longer significant at 90-d follow-up. 
Limitations include sample size and confounding by indication.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a significant difference between baseline and 14-d 
follow-up in several HRQoL and symptoms scales, favoring PCA over PN. However, 
no significant differences were observed in any HRQoL scales between PN and PCA 
of RCC stage cT1 from baseline to 90-d follow-up.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Surgical removal and percutaneous cryoablation (freezing) of 
small tumors in the kidney had a similar impact on quality of life after 90 d.

The recommendation encouraging patients with cancer to keep a normal body mass 
index (BMI) is largely extrapolated from data on risk of developing cancer. We 
tested the prospective association between peri-diagnostic (within 1 year 
post-diagnosis) BMI and all-cause mortality in patients with incident cancers. 
During 7.2 years of follow-up, 42% (48,340) of the 114 430 patients with cancer 
died. Spline analysis revealed that compared with a BMI of 22.5, a BMI lower 
than 22.5 was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality across 24 
cancer types. A BMI higher than 22.5 was associated with reduced all-cause 
mortality, while a non-linear association was observed; the lowest risk was 
found at a BMI of 29.6-34.2, and the risk started to return to and above unity 
at very high BMI values. The reduced mortality risk of high BMI was observed in 
23 of 24 cancer types and maintained after attempts to remove potential 
selection bias, confounding by smoking and comorbidities, and reserve causality. 
Compared with a normal BMI of 18.5-24.9, the hazard ratios were 0.85 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.87) for an overweight BMI (25-29.9) and 0.82 
(0.80-0.85) for an obese BMI (≥30), and the associations were generally 
consistent across cancer types and various subgroups. Obese BMI was associated 
with increased life expectancy, up to 6 years among men and 3 years among women. 
In conclusion, while overweight/obese BMI increases the risk of developing 
cancer in the general population, overweight/obese peri-diagnostic BMI was 
associated with longer survival in cancer patients.

Exaggerated post-exercise blood pressure (BP) is considered a risk factor for 
the development of cardiovascular disease in older females. Muscle echo 
intensity (EI) using ultrasound can be used to evaluate intramuscular fat, one 
of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to determine 
whether intramuscular fat assessed by muscle echo intensity is associated with 
the post-exercise BP response in older females. Ten older normotensive 
(SBP <130 mmHg, 71 ± 4 years), eight systolic BP-controlled (78 ± 4 years), and 
17 hypertensive (SBP ≥130 mmHg, 74 ± 6 years) females were studied. After 
obtaining ultrasound images to assess the EI, participants performed ramp-up 
exercise until 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC: ~30-s; 3% MVC/s gradually 
increased knee extension force from 0% to 50% MVC followed by sustaining the 
force at 50% MVC for 10-s) and then five MVCs (~50 s; 10-s rest between each 
contraction). BP was measured before and immediately after exercise. Mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) pre- and post-exercise were significantly lower in 
normotensive and SBP-controlled, than in -uncontrolled hypertensive females 
(PRE: 85 ± 5 and 87 ± 7 vs. 106 ± 9; POST: 92 ± 8 and 94 ± 9 vs. 103 ± 11 mmHg, 
respectively, p < 0.05). EI was negatively correlated with ∆diastolic BP (∆DBP) 
but not ∆SBP and ∆MAP in normotensive females only (∆SBP, r = -0.21, p = 0.56; 
∆DBP, R = -0.73, p = 0.02; ∆MAP, R = -0.49, p = 0.15). Greater intramuscular fat 
as indicated by higher EI is associated with less BP elevation immediately after 
exercise in older normotensive females. Greater intramuscular fat may lead to 
lower intramuscular pressure, resulting in less post-exercise BP elevation.

Chemical investigation of the fermentation extract of the coral-associated 
fungus Aspergillus sp. ITBBc1 led to the discovery of five unreported 
p-terphenyl derivatives, sanshamycins A-E (1-5), together with five previously 
described analogues, terphenyllin (6), 3-hydroxyterphenyllin (7), candidusin A 
(8), 4,5-dimethoxycandidusin A (9), and candidusin C (10). Their structures were 
elucidated by HRESIMS data and NMR spectroscopic analysis. Compound 1 represents 
the first example of p-terphenyls with an aldehyde substitution on the benzene 
ring. Compounds 2-4 feature varying methoxyl and isopentenyl substitutions, 
while compound 5 features a five-membered lactone linked to a biphenyl. These 
findings expand the chemical diversity of the family of p-terphenyl natural 
products. Compounds 1-6 and 9 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity 
against type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4), which is a fascinating drug target for 
treatment of inflammatory, respiratory, and neurological diseases. Compound 3 
was the most potent and exhibited PDE4D inhibitory activity with an IC50 value 
of 5.543 µM.

PURPOSE: Low bone mineral density (BMD) including low bone mass and osteoporosis 
is a bone state that carries the risk of fractures and the consequent burden. 
Since Iran has an aging population and is considered a high-risk country 
regarding fracture, the objective of this study was to report the low BMD 
attributable burden in Iran from 1990 to 2019 at national and subnational 
levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 
2019 estimates of exposure value and attributable burden were used. For each 
risk-outcome pair, following the estimation of relative risk, exposure level, 
and the Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Level (TMREL), the Population 
Attributable Fractions (PAFs) and attributable burden were computed. The Summary 
Exposure Value (SEV) index was also computed.
RESULTS: Although the age-standardized DALYs and deaths decreased (- 41.0 [95% 
uncertainty interval: - 45.7 to - 33.2] and - 43.3 [- 48.9 to - 32.5]), 
attributable all age numbers in Iran increased from 1990 to 2019 (64.3 [50.6 to 
89.1] and 66.8 [49.7 to 102.0]). The male gender had a higher low BMD attributed 
burden in Iran at national and subnational levels except for Tehran. Among low 
BMD-associated outcomes, motor vehicle road injuries and falls accounted for 
most of the low BMD-attributed burden in Iran. The SEV for low BMD remained 
constant from 1990 to 2019 in the country and females had higher SEVs.
CONCLUSION: Low BMD and the associated outcomes has to gain attention in Iran's 
health system due to an aging population. Hence, timely interventions by health 
systems and the population at stake might assist in reducing the burden 
attributed to low BMD.

Malignancy is one of the common diseases with high mortality worldwide and the 
most important obstacle to improving the overall life expectancy of the 
population in the 21st century. Currently, single or combined treatments, 
including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, are still the mainstream 
regimens for tumor treatment, but they all present significant side effects on 
normal tissues and organs, such as organ hypofunction, energy metabolism 
disorders, and various concurrent diseases. Based on this, theranostic measures 
for the highly selective killing of tumor cells have always been a hot area in 
cancer-related fields, among which photodynamic therapy (PDT) is expected to be 
an ideal candidate for practical clinical application due to its precise 
targeting and excellent safety performance, so-called PDT refers to a 
therapeutic method mainly composed of photosensitizers (PSs), laser light, and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Photoimmunotherapy (PIT), a combination of PDT 
and immunotherapy, can induce systemic antitumor immune responses and inhibit 
continuing growth and distant metastasis of residual tumor cells, demonstrating 
a promising application prospect. This article reviews the types of immune 
responses that occur in the host after PDT treatment, including innate and 
adaptive immunity. To further help PIT-related drugs improve their 
pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, we highlight the potential 
improvement of photodynamic immunotherapy from three aspects: immunostimulatory 
agents, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as different immune cells. 
Finally, we focus on recent advances in various strategies and shed light on 
their corresponding mechanisms of immune activation and possible clinical 
applications such as cancer vaccines. Having discovered the inherent potential 
of PDT and the mechanisms that PDT triggers host immune responses, a variety of 
immunotherapeutic strategies have been investigated in parallel with approaches 
to improve PDT efficiency. However, it remains to be further elucidated under 
what conditions the immune effect induced by PDT can achieve tumor 
immunosuppression and to what extent PDT-induced antitumor immunity will lead to 
complete tumor rejection. Currently, PIT presents several outstanding 
intractable challenges, such as the aggregation ability of PSs locally in 
tumors, deep tissue penetration ability of laser light, immune escape, and 
biological toxicity, and it is hoped that these issues raised will help to point 
out the direction of preclinical research on PIT and accelerate its transition 
to clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Sleep loss negatively affects brain function with repercussion not 
only on objective measures of performance but also on many subjective 
dimensions, including effort perceived for the completion of cognitive 
processes. This may be particularly important in aging, which is accompanied by 
important changes in sleep and wakefulness regulation. We aimed to determine 
whether subjectively perceived effort covaried with cognitive performance in 
healthy late-middle-aged individuals.
METHOD: We assessed effort and performance to cognitive tasks in 99 healthy 
adults (66 women; 50-70 years) during a 20-hr wake extension protocol, following 
7 days of regular sleep and wake times and a baseline night of sleep in the 
laboratory. We further explored links with cortical excitability using 
transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled to electroencephalography.
RESULTS: Perceived effort increased during wake extension and was highly 
correlated to subjective metrics of sleepiness, fatigue, and motivation, but not 
to variations in cortical excitability. Moreover, effort increase was associated 
with decreased performance to some cognitive tasks (psychomotor vigilance and 
two-back working memory task). Importantly, effort variations during wakefulness
