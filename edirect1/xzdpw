BACKGROUND: Motor function affects ability to perform daily activities and 
maintain independence. Yet, the interrelatedness of upper and lower extremity 
motor impairments and the magnitude of their contribution to slow gait and 
mobility difficulty are not well investigated.
METHODS: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 728, 
aged 50-99) completed motor and physical function tests including grip and knee 
extension strength, pegboard, finger tapping, standing balance, chair stands, 
fast-paced 400-m walk, and usual gait speed. Slow gait was defined as usual gait 
speed <1.0 m/s. Mobility difficulty was defined as self-reported difficulty 
walking ¼ mile or climbing stairs. Structural equation modeling examined the 
interrelationships of motor measures and their contributions to slow gait and 
mobility difficulty, adjusting for demographics and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Poorer manual dexterity (-0.571 standard deviation [SD] units, p < 
.001) and lower muscle strength (upper and lower extremity; -0.447 SD units, p = 
.014) were most strongly associated with slow gait speed, followed by slower 
chair stand pace (-0.195 SD units, p = .002) and greater lap time variation 
(0.102 SD units, p = .028). Lower muscle strength (-0.582 SD units, p = .001) 
was most strongly associated with mobility difficulty, followed by slower chair 
stand pace (-0.322 SD units, p < .001), slower gait speed (-0.247 SD units, p < 
.001), and poorer standing balance (-0.190 SD units, p = .043).
CONCLUSIONS: Components of manual dexterity and strength were the strongest 
correlates of slow gait and mobility difficulty in mid-to-late life. 
Longitudinal studies examining relationships between changes in these motor 
parameters and mobility are needed to elucidate possible causal effects.

Both sequence enrichment and base resolution are essential for accurate 
sequencing analysis of low-abundance RNA. Yet they are hindered by the lack of 
molecular tools. Here we report a bifunctional chemical signature for RNA 
4-thiouridine (4sU) enrichment sequencing with single-base resolution. This 
chemical signature is designed for specific 4sU labeling with two functional 
parts. One part is a distal alkynyl group for the biotin-assisted pulldown 
enrichment of target molecules via click chemistry crosslinking. The other part 
is a -NH group proximal to the pyrimidine ring of 4sU. It allows 4sU-to-cytosine 
transition during the polymerase-catalyzed extension reaction based on altering 
hydrogen-bonding patterns. Ultimately, the 4sU-containing RNA molecules can be 
enriched and accurately analyzed by single-base resolution sequencing. The 
proposed method also holds great potential to investigate transcriptome dynamics 
integrated with high-throughput sequencing.

[Process to insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy].

In type 1 diabetes mellitus and in symptomatic and critical hyperglycemic 
states, insulin is a lifesaving drug; however, its value in long-term type 2 
diabetes therapy, which represents more than 90% of diabetes, has not been 
assessed. This happens despite the fact that, in randomized studies on type 2 
diabetes, insulin is used in two-thirds of cases when intensive hypoglycemic 
treatment is needed and in half of the patients when treatment is the standard 
one. This is a major issue from a clinical, economic and social-health 
organization point of view as insulin therapy is expensive and needs a complex 
organization. Observational and retrospective studies from the scientific 
literature show that in this type of diabetes insulin treatment is associated 
with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is not clear whether 
this is due to a greater severity of the clinical picture, to the therapeutic 
target of blood glucose that may induce hypoglycemia, or to the intrinsic 
pharmacological activity of the drug that beyond reducing hyperglycemia can 
cause hypoglycemia, water retention, weight gain and hyperinsulinemia with 
proatherogenic effects. In particular, in patients with heart failure at high 
cardiovascular risk or with high insulin resistance, these clues are supported 
by meaningful data. Although there is no definitive evidence (the so-called 
"smoking gun") from randomized controlled trials, the high degree of suspicion 
induces the preferential choice of other drugs such as sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and 
metformin beyond avoiding glycemic targets that induce hypoglycemia, especially 
in frail, elderly patients, or patients with cardiovascular diseases. These 
drugs, for their proven efficacy and the easy use within an outpatient setting 
(that favors their prescription and improves the inertia of the doctor and the 
adherence of patients), could help a more effective treatment of patients, both 
for quality and life expectancy beyond mere glycemic control.

INTRODUCTION: Given the increase in life expectancy in the general population of 
our country, there is an exponential increase since the last decades of 
functional older adults who undergo total knee replacement (TKR). There is a 
direct relationship between the increase in age and the prevalence of both 
functional and cognitive disabling chronic diseases, however, little we know 
about whether age is an independent factor in predicting worse functional 
outcomes and readmissions after TKR. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the clinical-functional results and unplanned readmissions within the first 90 
postoperative days in patients older than 80 years compared with a control group 
of patients younger than 80 years.
METHODS: From our institutional patient database, 450 patients who underwent TKR 
between 2016 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had the 
medical assurance of Hospital Italiano (Plan de Salud), for which none of these 
was lost on the follow-up nor were treated in another hospital. Patients were 
divided in two groups: Group A with 186 patients over 80 years and a control 
group B with 264 patients between 70 and 80 years. The fragility of these was 
defined according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Simple Frail Score. 
Comorbidities were divided in eight groups to define which were the most 
influential in the final results.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in terms of unplanned 
readmissions, pain or in functional scores within 90 days between both groups. 
There was a significant difference in the length of postoperative hospital stay 
in favor of group A (A: 2.56 SD + - 0.76, B: 4.08 SD =  - 2.23; p = 0.00001). 
The Charlson score was higher in the group of patients older than 80 years 
(p = 0.02) as well as the Simple Frail Score (p = 0.004). The ASA score did not 
show significant differences between both groups.
CONCLUSION: Age as an independent factor proved not to be a predictor by itself 
of unplanned readmissions or worse clinical-functional results in a period of 90 
postoperative days between both groups. We believe that the preoperative 
evaluation of octogenarian patients should be multidisciplinary, with special 
attention to the identification of comorbidities that can influence the 
fragility of a patient and the optimization of the pathology.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening smokers and 
ex-smokers for lung cancer in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the health effects and costs of 
lung cancer screening from the healthcare perspective. The effects and costs of 
ten screening scenarios with different start and stop ages of screening were 
examined across a lifetime horizon in a cohort of 100,000 smokers and ex- 
smokers 50 years and older.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of screening smokers 
and ex-smokers aged 50-60 years, 50-70 years, and 50 years and older are below 
the cost-effectiveness threshold of € 20,000 per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Screening 50-60-year-old smokers and ex-smokers was the most 
cost-effective scenario with an ICER of € 14,094 per QALY gained. However, 
screening smokers and ex-smokers 50 years and older yielded the highest QALYs 
and resulted in an ICER of € 16,594 per QALY, which is below the threshold of € 
20,000 per QALY. All screening scenarios compared to no screening resulted in 
CERs between the € 14,000 and € 16,000 per QALY gained. The efficiency frontier 
showed that screening smokers and ex-smokers in the age groups 70 years and 
older, 60-70 years, 60 years and older are excluded by extended dominance by no 
screening, screening smokers and ex-smokers aged 50-60 years and 50-70 years.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that lung cancer screening is cost-effective in 
the Netherlands.

Efforts to prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection 
have begun to blunt the spread of HIV infection. Potent, safe, and 
well-tolerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows those infected with HIV to 
attain a life expectancy similar to that of HIV-uninfected individuals. But the 
persistence of the quiescent retroviral genome, enforced by the natural 
proliferative responses of the immune system itself, and a delicate balance of 
regulators viral expression, mandates lifelong ART suppression to prevent 
rebound viremia and the return of disease.The approach to HIV eradication that 
has been studied the most extensively envisions adding therapies to induce the 
expression of quiescent HIV-1 genomes following the control of viremia by ART, 
paired with immunotherapies to clear persistent infection. Paired testing of 
latency reversal and clearance strategies has begun, but the field is still in 
its infancy and additional obstacles to HIV eradication may emerge. However, 
there is reason for optimism that together with advances in ART delivery and HIV 
prevention strategies, efforts in HIV cure research will markedly diminish the 
effect of the HIV pandemic on society.

AIMS: Increases in life expectancy, comorbidities, and survival with complex 
cardiovascular conditions have changed the clinical profile of the patients in 
cardiac intensive care units (CICUs). In this environment, palliative care (PC) 
services are increasingly important. However, scarce information is available 
about the delivery of PC in CICUs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Critical Care Cardiology Trials Network (CCCTN) 
Registry is a network of tertiary care CICUs in North America. Between 2017 and 
2020, up to 26 centres contributed an annual 2-month snapshot of all consecutive 
medical CICU admissions. We captured code status at admission and the decision 
for comfort measures only (CMO) before all deaths in the CICU. Of 13 422 
patients, 10% died in the CICU and 2.6% were discharged to palliative hospice. 
Of patients who died in the CICU, 68% were CMO at death. In the CMO group, only 
13% were do not resuscitate/do not intubate at admission. The median time from 
CICU admission to CMO decision was 3.4 days (25th-75th percentiles: 1.2-7.7) and 
≥7 days in 27%. Time from CMO decision to death was <24 h in 88%, with a median 
of 3.8 h (25th-75th 1.0-10.3). Before a CMO decision, 78% received mechanical 
ventilation and 26% mechanical circulatory support. A PC provider team 
participated in the care of 41% of patients who died.
CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary CICU registry, comfort measures preceded death in 
two-thirds of cases, frequently without PC involvement. The high utilization of 
advanced intensive care unit therapies and lengthy times to a CMO decision 
highlight a potential opportunity for early engagement of PC teams in CICU.

To analyze the global burden of periodontal disease and its relation with 
socioeconomic development. Data of global disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
due to periodontal disease and human development index (HDI) from 1990 to 2019 
were obtained from Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and human development 
reports. The trend of the global burden of periodontal disease from 1990 to 2019 
was described. The correlation between age-standardized DALY rates and HDI were 
examined in 2019, and between-country periodontal disease burden inequality from 
1990 to 2019 was measured using health-related Gini coefficients and 
concentration indexes. From 1990 to 2019, the global DALY rate due to 
periodontal disease increased from 78.63 to 85.48, and the epidemiological 
burden did not increase significantly. Statistical differences were found across 
different HDI categories for age-standardized DALY rates of periodontal disease 
( 44.315, <0.01) in 2019. Linear regression analysis also revealed a negative 
correlation between age-standardized DALY rate of periodontal disease and HDI ( 
= -0.417, <0.01) . Gini coefficients decreased from 0.361 to 0.281 and 
concentration indexes fell from 0.0339 to -0.0538 between 1990 and 2019. The 
global burden of periodontal disease did not increase between 1990 and 2019, 
though the socioeconomic-associated inequality still existed. The burden of 
periodontal disease was more concentrated in less developed countries, and the 
socioeconomic-associated inequality has increased since 2000.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is Scotland's interactive website 
and mobile app for people with diabetes and their caregivers. It contains 
multimedia resources for diabetes education and offers access to electronic 
personal health records. This study aims to assess the cost-utility of MDMW 
compared with routine diabetes care in people with type 2 diabetes who do not 
use insulin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes 
Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model 2. Clinical parameters of MDMW users (n = 2576) 
were compared with a matched cohort of individuals receiving routine care alone 
(n = 11 628). Matching criteria: age, diabetes duration, sex, and socioeconomic 
status. Impact on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
costs of treatment and complications were simulated over ten years, including a 
10% sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: MDMW cohort: 1670 (64.8%) men; average age 64.3 years; duration of 
diabetes 5.5 years. 906 (35.2%) women: average age 61.6 years; duration 4.7 
years. The cumulative mean QALY (95% CI) gain: 0.054 (0.044-0.062) years. Mean 
difference in cost: -£118.72 (-£150.16 to -£54.16) over ten years. Increasing 
MDMW costs (10%): -£50.49 (-£82.24-£14.14). Decreasing MDMW costs (10%): 
-£186.95 (-£218.53 to -£122.51).
CONCLUSIONS: MDMW is "dominant" over usual care (cost-saving and life improving) 
in supporting self-management in people with type 2 diabetes not treated with 
insulin. Wider use may result in significant cost savings through delay or 
reduction of long-term complications and improved QALYs in Scotland and other 
countries. MDMW may be among the most cost-effective interventions currently 
available to support diabetes.

Stroke remains the second-leading cause of death and the third-leading cause of 
death and disability combined (as expressed by disability-adjusted life-years 
lost - DALYs) in the world. The estimated global cost of stroke is over US$721 
billion (0.66% of the global GDP). From 1990 to 2019, the burden (in terms of 
the absolute number of cases) increased substantially (70.0% increase in 
incident strokes, 43.0% deaths from stroke, 102.0% prevalent strokes, and 143.0% 
DALYs), with the bulk of the global stroke burden (86.0% of deaths and 89.0% of 
DALYs) residing in lower-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). This 
World Stroke Organisation (WSO) Global Stroke Fact Sheet 2022 provides the most 
updated information that can be used to inform communication with all internal 
and external stakeholders; all statistics have been reviewed and approved for 
use by the WSO Executive Committee as well as leaders from the Global Burden of

Increased life expectancy among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) has increased 
the desire for parenthood. It is therefore important that PLHIV and health care 
providers (HCPs) are aware of the available assisted reproduction services (ARS) 
for PLHIV facing infertility or unsuppressed viremia. Through secondary data 
analysis we identified PLHIV who were actively trying to conceive and their 
knowledge of ARS. As specialized fertility care for PLHIV is managed by 
Obstetrician/Gynecologists (Ob/Gyns), they were surveyed regarding their 
attitudes towards working with PLHIV and their awareness and knowledge of ARS 
with a self-administered questionnaire. In this cross-sectional study, 251 PLHIV 
and 102 Ob/Gyns were recruited and interviewed using a semi-structured 
questionnaire. Although most Ob/Gyns (81%) reported being supportive of PLHIV 
having children, 85% counseled against pregnancy, particularly persons in HIV 
serodifferent relationships. Significantly more PLHIV under 40 years compared to 
those over 40 years had heard about ARS (59% vs. 43%, p = .007). Ob/Gyns were 
more knowledgeable of expensive ARS, while PLHIV's knowledge was more restricted 
to cheaper more accessible ones. In conclusion Ob/Gyns knowledge gaps and 
underlying stereotypes may present barriers to PLHIV's uptake of ARS. 
Additionally, virologically unsuppresed persons in HIV serodifferent 
relationships may be vulnerable as Ob/Gyns were less supportive of them.

Tooth-wear signatures obtained from maxillary carnassial fourth premolar teeth 
of raccoons in three ecologic regions in Nigeria testified to segregations in 
diet of the species with more abrasive diet in specimens from coastal 
south-western areas compared to more vegetal diet content of those from middle 
belt and northern areas. Endoloph assessments showed sexually dimorphic mesowear 
signals between and within locations suggestive that males are more exposed to 
dental wears compared to females; Male and female specimens from rainforest zone 
had 40.2% and 34.2% respectively, Sudan Savanna zone had 46.8% and 40.6% for 
females and males while 67.6% and 44.3% for Sahel zone specimens in similar 
order. We investigated dietary resource use for sustained survivability within 
limits of interspecific spatial overlaps using seasonal rainfall indices between 
two years. There was 86% per high dental occlusal surface relief in the 
specimens from the savannas while 32% per low relief was observed in 
South-Western badgers teeth samples. This study observed a change in habitat use 
as a predisposing factor to sub-regional dental wear differences among age 
groups as well as sexes of species from three geographic climatic areas. The 
richness of the eco-habitat/life expectancy found in the rain forest can be 
ascribed to diet availability which is reduced in the savanna areas. The study 
suggests minimal change in habitat use as a predisposing factor in sub-regional 
species dental relief differences observed among age groups and sexes of the 
species from three geographic climatic areas and also represents quality of the 
eco-habitats.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now widely used in cancer therapy. 
However, the biological effects of SBRT compared with conventional radiotherapy 
(CRT) are not clear. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in many biological 
processes and cellular life activities. The effects of SBRT or CRT on the 
morphology and cytoskeletal structure of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
cells remain unknown. Based on the biologically equivalent dose (BED) formula, 
we designed SBRT and CRT fractionation regimens with the same BED. The 
morphology was captured during radiation, and rhodamine-phalloidin 
immunofluorescence was used to study the cytoskeleton. A lactate dehydrogenase 
assay kit was used to determine the cell membrane permeability, and western blot 
was used to detect the cytoskeleton protein expression levels. The morphology 
and cytoskeleton expanded after SBRT or CRT, with an increase in cell membrane 
permeability and stable cytoskeleton protein levels. Besides, different dose of 
SBRT (10,20,30 Gy) induce similar morphology and cytoskeleton enlargement. Our 
findings indicate that SBRT and CRT can induce cytoskeleton reorganization and 
the enlargement of cell morphology (at different rates) in NSCLC. The morphology 
and cytoskeleton enlargement after SBRT are dose independence.

Acromegaly is a complex endocrinological disorder commonly caused by 
hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH) typically due to pituitary gland tumors. 
Patients with acromegaly who are successfully treated and biochemically managed 
have a reasonably average life expectancy. However, it causes a cascade of 
multi-systemic involvement throughout the patient's life, including 
cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, respiratory, metabolic, neurological, 
neoplastic, and gastrointestinal involvement, resulting in a higher rate of 
hospitalization, lower quality of life, and a shorter life expectancy. Although 
cardiovascular complications are the primary cause of death in patients with 
acromegaly, malignancy is now emerging as a major killer in these individuals. 
Colorectal carcinoma has been reported to be prevalent in acromegaly 
individuals. This review article has compiled studies to demonstrate a link 
between acromegaly and colorectal neoplasia, intending to provide a strong 
foundation for their clinical relationship. This article has summarised a 
potential pathogenic mechanism and provided insights into the clinical 
presentation of such patients. Furthermore, this article has provided a brief 
overview of current screening recommendations for colorectal neoplasia in 
acromegaly patients.

Introduction: Primary care clinicians report inadequate training and lack of 
support regarding identification of early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder 
(ASD), resulting in later diagnosis and poor outcomes. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the perception of participants in ECHO Autism project 
regarding the value of the virtual collaborative as a mentoring tool. Methods: 
We completed a retrospective cross-sectional study of post-virtual clinic 
surveys of all participants who attended Autism ECHO from September 2, 2015 to 
June 5, 2019. Results: There were 87 Autism ECHO sessions held, with 83 didactic 
presentations. A total of 92 de-identified patient cases were discussed with 490 
unique learners in attendance. Participants reported increase in self-efficacy 
in identifying ASD symptoms in children, assessing medical comorbidities, and 
learning new information. Discussion: Continuing education platforms in 
healthcare professions are increasingly embracing virtual live-interactive 
conferences. They provide opportunities to connect with experts, but also hear 
from peers regarding real-life case examples. During COVID-19 pandemic ECHO 
Autism was a lifeline for rural providers and will likely continue to increase 
in participation.

BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides can have 
deleterious effects on insects and the environment. The use of nanoparticles 
synthesized from microbes has recently gained importance as a safe alternative 
to conventional insecticides. Recently, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles 
synthesized using Bacillus thuringiensis have shown insecticidal potential; 
however, in addition to its acute toxicity, it is necessary to determine 
possible sublethal effects at the organismal level to understand the toxicity of 
a new insecticide. Bt-derived enzymes such as nitrate reductase and other 
biomolecules play a vital role in the reduction of metal ions to metal 
nanoparticles. Here, we assessed the acute toxicity and sublethal effects of ZnO 
nanoparticles produced in the culture supernatant of B. thuringiensis ser. 
israelensis (Bti) as a reducing agent on the biological traits of Musca 
domestica.
RESULTS: Concentration-response larval bioassays using different concentrations 
of ZnO-Bti-supernatant nanoparticles revealed LC10 , LC20 , LC50 and LC90 values 
of 4.17, 6.11, 12.73 and 38.90 μg g-1 of larval diet, respectively. Exposure of 
M. domestica larvae to two concentrations (LC10 and LC20 ) resulted in a 
lengthened developmental time (egg to adult) and preoviposition period, and 
reduced fecundity, survival, longevity and oviposition period. Furthermore, 
population parameters including net reproductive rate, mean generation time, 
age-specific survival rate, fecundity, life expectancy and reproductive values, 
analyzed following age-stage and two-sex life table theory, were significantly 
decreased after exposure to these concentrations of ZnO-Bti-supernatant 
nanoparticles compared with the control.
CONCLUSION: ZnO-Bti-supernatant nanoparticles were shown to be toxic to M. 
domestica. Exposure of M. domestica to low concentrations of ZnO-Bti-supernatant 
nanoparticles resulted in negative transgenerational effects on progeny 
production in this fly. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. We aimed 
to report the burden of liver cancer at the global, regional, and national 
levels in 204 countries from 1990 to 2019, stratified by etiology, sex, age, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: Data of mortality, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of liver cancer and its etiology were available from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2019. The trends in the 
liver cancer burden were assessed by the annual percentage change. All estimates 
are presented as numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 
population, with uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: Globally, 484,577 (95% UI 444,091-525,798) mortalities, 534,364 
(486,550-588,639) incident cases, and 12,528,422 (11,400,671-13,687,675) 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to liver cancer occurred in 2019. The 
ASRs were 5.95 (5.44-6.44), 6.51 (5.95-7.16), and 151.08 (137.53-164.8) per 
100,000 population for the mortalities, incidences, and DALYs, respectively. 
From 1990 to 2019, the numbers increased, whereas the ASRs decreased. Hepatitis 
B and Hepatitis C are the major causes of liver cancer mortality. The liver 
cancer mortality in 2019 increased with age, peaking at 65-69 and 70-74 age 
group in males and females, respectively, and the number was higher in males 
than in females. Generally, there were nonlinear associations between the ASR 
and SDIs values at the regional and national levels. China had the highest 
numbers of mortalities, incident cases, and DALYs, whereas Mongolia has the 
highest ASR in 2019.
CONCLUSION: Liver cancer remains a major public health issue worldwide, but 
etiological and geographical variations exist. It is necessary to increase 
awareness of the population regarding liver cancer, its etiologies and the 
importance of early detection, and diagnosis and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Sugar is the main source of energy for nearly all animals. 
However, consumption of a high amount of sugars can lead to many metabolic 
disorders hence, balancing calorie intake in the form of sugar is required. 
Various herbs are in use to control body weight, cure diabetes and control 
elevated blood sugar levels. One such herb is Gymnema sylvestre commonly called 
Gurmar (destroyer of sugar). Gurmar selectively inhibits sugar sensation by 
mechanisms that are still elusive.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to understand the effect of 
gurmar on sweet taste feeding behaviour in insects using the invertebrate model 
system Drosophila melanogaster.
METHODS: For this study, we used feeding assays, spectrophotometry and Proboscis 
Extension Reflex (PER) assay to determine how flies detect gurmar. Additionally, 
life span analysis, egg-laying behaviour and developmental profiles were used to 
probe the role of gurmar on the overall health of the flies. During the whole 
study, we used only the raw powdered form of gurmar (dried leaves) to examine 
its effect on sweet taste feeding behaviour.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that whole gurmar in a raw powdered form is 
aversive to flies and inhibits sugar evoked PER and feeding responses. Also, we 
observed it takes at least 24 h of starvation time to reduce the consumption of 
sugar in flies pre-fed on gurmar. Flies lay a fewer number of eggs on gurmar 
media and show developmental defects. Our data suggest that flies detect gurmar 
using both taste and olfactory cues.
CONCLUSION: Understanding how gurmar reshapes taste curves to promote reduced 
consumption of sugars in flies will open up avenues to help people with health 
issues related to high sugar consumption, but our data also highlights that its 
consumption should be carefully considered since gurmar is aversive to flies and 
has detrimental effects on development.

Comparing the Acceptance of Mobile Hypertension Apps for Disease Management 
Among Patients Versus Clinical Use Among Physicians: Cross-sectional Survey.

Düsseldorf, Germany.

BACKGROUND: High blood pressure or hypertension is a vastly prevalent chronic 
condition among adults that can, if not appropriately treated, contribute to 
several life-threatening secondary diseases and events, such as stroke. In 
addition to first-line medication, self-management in daily life is crucial for 
tertiary prevention and can be supported by mobile health apps, including 
medication reminders. However, the prescription of medical apps is a relatively 
novel approach. There is limited information regarding the determinants of 
acceptance of such mobile health (mHealth) apps among patients as potential 
users and physicians as impending prescribers in direct comparison.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to investigate the determinants of the 
acceptance of health apps (in terms of intention to use) among patients for 
personal use and physicians for clinical use in German-speaking countries. 
Moreover, we assessed patients' preferences regarding different delivery modes 
for self-care service (face-to-face services, apps, etc).
METHODS: Based on an extended model of the unified theory of acceptance and use 
of technology (UTAUT2), we performed a web-based cross-sectional survey to 
explore the acceptance of mHealth apps for self-management of hypertension among 
patients and physicians in Germany. In addition to UTAUT2 variables, we measured 
self-reported self-efficacy, eHealth literacy, previous experiences with health 
apps, perceived threat to privacy, and protection motivation as additional 
determinants of mHealth acceptance. Data from 163 patients and 46 physicians 
were analyzed using hierarchical regression and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: As expected, a significant influence of the unified theory of 
acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) predictors on intentions to use 
hypertension apps was confirmed, especially for performance expectancy. 
Intention to use was moderate in patients (mean 3.5; SD 1.1; range 1-5) and 
physicians (mean 3.4, SD 0.9), and did not differ between both groups. Among 
patients, a higher degree of self-reported self-efficacy and protection 
motivation contributed to an increased explained variance in acceptance with 
R2=0.09, whereas eHealth literacy was identified as exerting a positive 
influence on physicians (increased R2=0.10). Furthermore, our findings indicated 
mediating effects of performance expectancy on the acceptance among patients but 
not among physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study has identified performance expectancy as the 
most important determinant of the acceptance of mHealth apps for self-management 
of hypertension among patients and physicians. Concerning patients, we also 
identified mediating effects of performance expectancy on the relationships 
between effort expectancy and social influence and the acceptance of apps. 
Self-efficacy and protection motivation also contributed to an increase in the 
explained variance in app acceptance among patients, whereas eHealth literacy 
was a predictor in physicians. Our findings on additional determinants of the 
acceptance of health apps may help tailor educational material and 
self-management interventions to the needs and preferences of prospective users 
of hypertension apps in future research.
