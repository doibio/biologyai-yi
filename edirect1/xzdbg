BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The ReFLeCT study demonstrated that switching to insulin 
degludec from other basal insulins was associated with reductions in glycated 
hemoglobin and hypoglycemic events in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
and reductions in insulin doses in T1D. The aim of the present analysis was to 
assess the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of switching to insulin 
degludec in Sweden.
METHODS: Short-term outcomes were evaluated over 1 year in a Microsoft Excel 
model, while long-term outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the 
IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Cohort characteristics and treatment effects were 
sourced from the ReFLeCT study. Costs (in 2018 Swedish krona [SEK]) encompassed 
direct medical expenditure and indirect costs from loss of workplace 
productivity. In the long-term analyses, patients were assumed to receive 
insulin degludec or continue prior insulin therapy (primarily insulin glargine 
U100) for 5 years, before all patients intensified to once-daily degludec and 
mealtime aspart.
RESULTS: Switching to insulin degludec was associated with improved 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.02 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) over 1 year, and 0.16 and 0.08 QALYs over patient lifetimes, in T1D and 
T2D. Combined costs in T1D and T2D were estimated to be SEK 1,249 lower and SEK 
1,181 higher over the short-term, and SEK 157,258 and SEK 2,114 lower over the 
long-term. Benefits were due to lower insulin doses in T1D, reduced rates of 
hypoglycemia, and lower incidences of diabetes-related complications. Insulin 
degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SEK 
64,298 per QALY gained for T2D over 1 year and considered dominant for T1D and 
T2D in all other comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin degludec was projected to be cost-effective or dominant 
versus other basal insulins for the treatment of T1D and T2D in Sweden.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, there have been adverse trends in premature 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates (35-74 years) in the USA and 
Australia. Following long-term declines, rates in the USA are now increasing 
while falls in Australia have slowed rapidly. These two countries also have the 
highest adult obesity prevalence of high-income countries. This study 
investigates the role of overweight and obesity in their recent CVD mortality 
trends by using multiple cause of death (MCOD) data-direct individual-level 
evidence from death certificates-and linking the findings to cohort lifetime 
obesity prevalence.
METHODS: We identified overweight- and obesity-related mortality as any CVD 
reported on the death certificate (CVD MCOD) with one or more of diabetes, 
chronic kidney disease, obesity, lipidemias or hypertensive heart disease 
(DKOLH-CVD), causes strongly associated with overweight and obesity. DKOLH-CVD 
comprises 50% of US and 40% of Australian CVD MCOD mortality. Trends in 
premature age-standardized death rates were compared between DKOLH-CVD and other 
CVD MCOD deaths (non-DKOLH-CVD). Deaths from 2000 to 2017 in the USA and 
2006-2016 in Australia were analyzed. Trends in in age-specific DKOLH-CVD death 
rates were related to cohort relative lifetime obesity prevalence.
RESULTS: Each country's DKOLH-CVD mortality rate rose by 3% per annum in the 
most recent year, but previous declines had reversed more rapidly in Australia. 
Non-DKOLH-CVD mortality in the USA increased in 2017 after declining strongly in 
the early 2000s, but in Australia it has continued declining in stark contrast 
to DKOLH-CVD. There were larger increases in DKOLH-CVD mortality rates at 
successively younger ages, strongly related with higher relative lifetime 
obesity prevalence in younger cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in DKOLH-CVD mortality in each country suggests that 
overweight and obesity has likely been a key driver of the recent slowdown or 
reversal of CVD mortality decline in both countries. The larger recent increases 
in DKOLH-CVD mortality and higher lifetime obesity prevalence in younger age 
groups are very concerning and are likely to adversely impact CVD mortality 
trends and hence life expectancy in future. MCOD data is a valuable but 
underutilized source of data to track important mortality trends.

BACKGROUND: Preference-based Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is one of the 
most important indicators for calculating QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) in 
a cost-effectiveness analysis. This study aimed to collect data on healthy 
individuals' HRQL based on the preferences of Japanese people who had undergone 
a comprehensive health check-up, and to examine the influence of relevant 
factors, such as blood biochemical data and lifestyle behavior.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study targeting people who had undergone 
a comprehensive health check-up in 2015. Participants were asked to respond to a 
medical interview sheet. We then examined the utility value, as well as 
lifestyle habits such as alcohol intake, smoking, and exercise. HRQL was 
examined using EQ-5D-5L. Using a multiple regression analysis, we examined the 
influence of related factors, such as lifestyle and biochemical test data.
RESULTS: We collected 2037 responses (mean age = 54.98 years; 55.0% female). The 
average preference-based health-related HRQL was 0.936 ± 0.087. A total of 1167 
people (57.2%) responded that they were completely healthy. The biochemical test 
data that were recognized to correlate with HRQL were hemoglobin, total 
cholesterol, creatinine, all of which were weak (r = - 0.045-0.113). The results 
of multiple regression analysis showed that significant facts were: being 
female, age (≧70 year-old), drinking alcohol (sometimes), activity (very often), 
and lack of sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: The HRQL of participants who had undergone a comprehensive health 
check-up was generally high, and only declined for those over 70 years of age. 
It is suggested that preference-based HRQL is related to physical activity, and 
that decrease of activity and lack of sleep leads to a decrease in HRQL.

INTRODUCTION: Depression is a highly prevalent condition in the elderly, with a 
vast impact on quality of life, life expectancy, and medical outcomes. Selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed agents in 
this condition and, although generally safe, tolerability issues cannot be 
overlooked. Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with a novel mechanism of action. 
Based on studies to date, it may have a promising tolerability profile in the 
elderly, as it does not adversely affect psychomotor or cognitive performance 
and does not alter cardiovascular and endocrine parameters. The present study 
aims to assess the tolerability profile of vortioxetine in comparison with the 
SSRIs considered as a single group in elderly participants with depression. The 
rate of participants withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events after 6 
months of follow up will be the primary outcome.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, 
parallel-group, superiority, randomized trial funded by the Italian Medicines 
Agency (AIFA - Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco). Thirteen Italian Community 
Psychiatric Services will consecutively enrol elderly participants suffering 
from an episode of major depression over a period of 12 months. Participants 
will be assessed at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months of follow up. At each 
time point, the following validated rating scales will be administered: 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Antidepressant Side-Effect 
Checklist (ASEC), EuroQual 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Blessed Test (SBT), and 
Charlson Age-Comorbidity Index (CACI). Outcome assessors and the statistician 
will be masked to treatment allocation. A total of 358 participants (179 in each 
group) will be enrolled.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will fully adhere to the ICH E6 Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice. Participants' data will be managed and safeguarded 
according to the European Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. An external 
Ethical Advisory Board will help guarantee high ethical standards.

INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists on the cost-effectiveness of interventions 
to prevent obesity and promote healthy body image in adolescents. The SHINE 
(Supporting Healthy Image, Nutrition and Exercise) study is a cluster randomised 
control trial (cRCT) aiming to deliver universal education about healthy 
nutrition and physical activity to adolescents, as well as targeted advice to 
young people with body image concerns who are at risk of developing disordered 
eating behaviours. This paper describes the methods for the economic evaluation 
of the SHINE cRCT, to determine whether the intervention is cost-effective as an 
obesity prevention measure.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A public payer perspective will be adopted, with 
intervention costs collected prospectively. Within-trial cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) will quantify the incremental 
costs and health gains of the intervention as compared with usual practice (ie, 
teacher-delivered curriculum). CEA will present results as cost per body mass 
index unit saved. CUA will present results as cost per quality-adjusted life 
year gained. A modelled CUA will extend the target population, time horizon and 
decision context to provide valuable information to policymakers on the 
potential for incremental cost offsets attributable to disease prevention 
arising from intervention. Intervention costs and effects will be extrapolated 
to the population of Australian adolescents in Grade 7 of secondary school 
(approximate age 13 years) and modelled over the cohort's lifetime. Modelled CUA 
results will be presented as health-adjusted life years saved and healthcare 
cost-savings of diseases averted. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be 
calculated as the difference in costs between the intervention and comparator 
divided by the difference in benefit. Semi-structured interviews with key 
intervention stakeholders will explore the potential impact of scalability on 
cost-effectiveness. These data will be thematically analysed to inform 
sensitivity analysis of the base case economic evaluation, such that 
cost-effectiveness evidence is reflective of the potential for scalability.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Deakin 
University Human Research Ethics Committee (#2017-269) and the Victorian 
Department of Education and Training (#2018_003630). Study findings will be 
disseminated through peer-reviewed academic papers and participating schools 
will receive annual reports over the 3 years of data collection.

BACKGROUND: Considering the increase in overall life expectancy and the rising 
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), more elderly patients are 
considered for hepatic resection. Traditionally, major hepatectomy has not been 
proposed to the elderly due to severe comorbidities. Indeed, only a few case 
series are reported in the literature. The present study aimed to compare 
short-term and long-term outcomes between laparoscopic major hepatectomy (LMH) 
and open major hepatectomy (OMH) in elderly patients with HCC using propensity 
score matching (PSM).
METHODS: We performed a multicentric retrospective study including 184 
consecutive cases of HCC major liver resection in patients aged ≥ 70 years in _8 
European Hospital Centers. Patients were divided into LMH and OMH groups, and 
perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 122 patients were enrolled, 38 in the 
LMH group and 84 in the OMH group. Postoperative overall complications were 
lower in the LMH than in the OMH group (18 vs. 46%, p < 0.001). Hospital stay 
was shorter in the LMH group than in the OMH group (5 vs. 7 days, p = 0.01). 
Mortality at 90 days was comparable between the two groups. There were no 
significant differences between the two groups in terms of overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1, 3, and 5 years.
CONCLUSION: LMH for HCC is associated with appropriate short-term outcomes in 
patients aged ≥ 70 years as compared to OMH. LMH is safe and feasible in elderly 
patients with HCC.

Namibia is a Southern African country with social inequalities. This paper 
discusses the historical development of health promotion in Namibia. The country 
has achieved tremendous progress in public health after gaining independence in 
March 1990, with increased life expectancy, reduced tuberculosis and AIDS 
mortality due to high coverage of antiretroviral therapy (90%) in 2012, and a 
reduced under-five mortality rate, from 74 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 
to 50 in 2013. However, challenges still exist in achieving health for all. 
Non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 
are among the top 10 diseases and top 15 causes of death, with diabetes emerging 
as one of the greatest threats to health. Opportunities and obstacles for 
effective health promotion are discussed. In conclusion, health promotion in 
Namibia has the potential to improve the health of the populace.

Policy Points Changes in US state policies since the 1970s, particularly after 
2010, have played an important role in the stagnation and recent decline in US 
life expectancy. Some US state policies appear to be key levers for improving 
life expectancy, such as policies on tobacco, labor, immigration, civil rights, 
and the environment. US life expectancy is estimated to be 2.8 years longer 
among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all US states enjoyed the health 
advantages of states with more liberal policies, which would put US life 
expectancy on par with other high-income countries.
CONTEXT: Life expectancy in the United States has increased little in previous 
decades, declined in recent years, and become more unequal across US states. 
Those trends were accompanied by substantial changes in the US policy 
environment, particularly at the state level. State policies affect nearly every 
aspect of people's lives, including economic well-being, social relationships, 
education, housing, lifestyles, and access to medical care. This study examines 
the extent to which the state policy environment may have contributed to the 
troubling trends in US life expectancy.
METHODS: We merged annual data on life expectancy for US states from 1970 to 
2014 with annual data on 18 state-level policy domains such as tobacco, 
environment, tax, and labor. Using the 45 years of data and controlling for 
differences in the characteristics of states and their populations, we modeled 
the association between state policies and life expectancy, and assessed how 
changes in those policies may have contributed to trends in US life expectancy 
from 1970 through 2014.
FINDINGS: Results show that changes in life expectancy during 1970-2014 were 
associated with changes in state policies on a conservative-liberal continuum, 
where more liberal policies expand economic regulations and protect marginalized 
groups. States that implemented more conservative policies were more likely to 
experience a reduction in life expectancy. We estimated that the shallow upward 
trend in US life expectancy from 2010 to 2014 would have been 25% steeper for 
women and 13% steeper for men had state policies not changed as they did. We 
also estimated that US life expectancy would be 2.8 years longer among women and 
2.1 years longer among men if all states enjoyed the health advantages of states 
with more liberal policies.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding and reversing the troubling trends and growing 
inequalities in US life expectancy requires attention to US state policy 
contexts, their dynamic changes in recent decades, and the forces behind those 
changes. Changes in US political and policy contexts since the 1970s may 
undergird the deterioration of Americans' health and longevity.

BackgroundDigital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a promising screening test, but 
its outcomes and cost-effectiveness remain uncertain.PurposeTo determine if 
biennial DBT is cost-effective in a screening setting, when compared with 
digital mammography (DM) in the Netherlands, and to quantify the 
uncertainty.Materials and MethodsIn this study, performed from March 2018 to 
February 2019, the MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis model was used to conduct 
a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), consisting of 10 000 model runs with 
1 000 000 women simulated per run. The Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
package and the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information tool were used to 
process PSA outcomes. Two simulated cohorts born in 1970 were invited to undergo 
biennial screening between ages 50 and 74 years-one cohort was assigned to DM 
screening, and one was assigned to DBT screening. DM input parameters were based 
on data from the Dutch breast cancer screening program. DBT parameters were 
based on literature and expert opinion. Willingness-to-pay thresholds of €20 000 
($22 000) and €35 000 ($38 500) per life-year gained (LYG) were considered. 
Effects and costs were discounted at 3.5% per year.ResultsDBT resulted in a gain 
of 13 additional life-years per 1000 women invited to screening (7% increase, 13 
of 193), followed over lifetime, compared with DM and led to 2% (four of 159) 
fewer false-positive results. DBT screening led to incremental discounted 
lifetime effects of 5.09 LYGs (95% confidence interval: -0.80, 9.70) and an 
increase in lifetime costs of €137 555 ($151 311) per 1000 women (95% confidence 
interval: €31 093 [$34 202], €263 537 [$289 891]) compared with DM, resulting in 
a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €27 023 ($29 725) per LYG. The 
probability of DBT being more cost-effective was 0.36 at €20 000 and 0.66 at 
€35 000 per LYG.ConclusionSwitching from digital mammography to biennial digital 
breast tomosynthesis is not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€20 000 per life-year gained, but digital breast tomosynthesis has a higher 
probability of being more cost-effective than digital mammography at a threshold 
of €35 000 per life-year gained.© RSNA, 2020Online supplemental material is

AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin added to standard 
therapy, vs. standard therapy only, in patients with heart failure (HF) with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), from the perspective of UK, German, and 
Spanish payers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A lifetime Markov model was built to estimate outcomes in 
patients with HFrEF. Health states were defined by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire total symptom score, type 2 diabetes and worsening HF events. The 
incidence of worsening HF and all-cause mortality was estimated using negative 
binomial regression models and parametric survival analysis, respectively. 
Direct healthcare costs (2019 British pounds/Euro) and patient-reported outcomes 
(EQ-5D) were sourced from the existing literature and the Dapagliflozin And 
Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF), respectively; 
the median duration of follow-up in DAPA-HF was 18.2 months (range: 0-27.8). 
Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.0% for the Spanish and German 
analyses and 3.5% for the UK analysis. In the UK setting, treatment with 
dapagliflozin was estimated to increase life-years and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) from 5.62 to 6.20 (+0.58) and 4.13 to 4.61 (+0.48), 
respectively, and reduce lifetime hospitalizations for HF (925 and 820 events 
per 1000 patients for placebo and dapagliflozin, respectively). Similar results 
were obtained for Germany and Spain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were £5822, €5379 and €9406/QALY in the UK, Germany and Spain, respectively. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, more than 90% of simulations were 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000/QALY in UK and 
€20 000/QALY in Germany and Spain.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is likely to be a cost-effective treatment for HFrEF 
in the UK, German and Spanish healthcare systems.

India has the highest burden of leprosy in the world. Following a recent WHO 
guideline, the Indian National Leprosy Programme is introducing post-exposure 
prophylaxis with single-dose rifampicin (SDR-PEP) in all high-endemic districts 
of the country. The aim of this study is to estimate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of SDR-PEP in different leprosy disability burden situations. 
We used a stochastic individual-based model (SIMCOLEP) to simulate the leprosy 
new case detection rate trend and the impact of implementing contact screening 
and SDR-PEP from 2016 to 2040 (25 years) in the Union Territory of Dadra Nagar 
Haveli (DNH) in India. Effects of the intervention were expressed as disability 
adjusted life years (DALY) averted under three assumption of disability 
prevention: 1) all grade 1 disability (G1D) cases prevented; 2) G1D cases 
prevented in PB cases only; 3) no disability prevented. Costs were US$ 2.9 per 
contact. Costs and effects were discounted at 3%. The incremental cost per DALY 
averted by SDR-PEP was US$ 210, US$ 447, and US$ 5,673 in the 25th year under 
assumption 1, 2, and 3, respectively. If prevention of G1D was assumed, the 
probability of cost-effectiveness was 1.0 at the threshold of US$ 2,000, which 
is equivalent to the GDP per capita of India. The probability of 
cost-effectiveness was 0.6, if no disability prevention was assumed. The cost 
per new leprosy case averted was US$ 2,873. Contact listing, screening and the 
provision of SDR-PEP is a cost-effective strategy in leprosy control in both the 
short (5 years) and long term (25 years). The cost-effectiveness depends on the 
extent to which disability can be prevented. As the intervention becomes 
increasingly cost-effective in the long term, we recommend a long-term 
commitment for its implementation.

Craniopharyngioma as a rare tumor originating from cells of rathke's pouch and 
representing 2-5% of all intracranial tumors is a rare and generally benign 
neoplasm of the central nervous system with two incidence peaks one in childhood 
and one after 40 years of age. Data on adult patients is scarce compared to 
childhood onset tumors, however the burden of disease caused by the tumors and 
related treatment options is significant. Clinical symptoms range from 
headaches, visual disability, cranial nerve affection or hypothalamic symptoms 
(e. g. morbid obesity) to endocrine disorders. Most symptoms are related to 
tumor mass effect. The current standard of diagnostics is the determination of 
serum hormone levels and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging often 
resulting in surgical treatment which holds a key role in all treatment concepts 
and should follow a hypothalamus sparing path. Radiation therapy may prove 
beneficial as adjuvant therapeutic option or in recurrent tumor, especially 
papillary tumors may be targeted using BRAF-600 inhibitors, targeted therapies 
for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma have not yet reached a stage of clinical 
testing. Although prognosis regarding overall survival is favorable, life 
expectancy may be reduced due to the tumor itself as well as due to treatment 
effects. An important aspect especially in the adult population is the reduction 
in quality of life which is comparable to primary malignant brain tumors and 
metastases, calling for individual patient specific treatment approaches.

Quantifying Spatial Activation Patterns of Motor Units in Finger Extensor 
Muscles.

Jiang X, Ren H, Xu K, Ye X, Dai C, Clancy EA, Zhang YT, Chen W.

The ability to expertly control different fingers contributes to hand dexterity 
during object manipulation in daily life activities. The macroscopic spatial 
patterns of muscle activations during finger movements using global surface 
electromyography (sEMG) have been widely researched. However, the spatial 
activation patterns of microscopic motor units (MUs) under different finger 
movements have not been well investigated. The present work aims to quantify MU 
spatial activation patterns during movement of distinct fingers (index, middle, 
ring and little finger). Specifically, we focused on extensor muscles during 
extension contractions. Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) during movement of 
each finger were obtained through decomposition of high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG). 
First, we quantified the spatial activation patterns of MUs for each finger 
based on 2-dimension (2-D) root-mean-square (RMS) maps of MUAP grids after 
spike-triggered averaging. We found that these activation patterns under 
different finger movements are distinct along the distal-proximal direction, but 
with partial overlap. Second, to further evaluate MU separability, we classified 
the spatial activation pattern of each individual MU under distinct finger 
movement and associated each MU with its corresponding finger with Regularized 
Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (RUMLDA). A high accuracy of 
MU-finger classification tested on 12 subjects with a mean of 88.98% was 
achieved. The quantification of MU spatial activation patterns could be 
beneficial to studies of neural mechanisms of the hand. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first work which manages to quantify MU behaviors under 
different finger movements.

Septic tenosynovitis of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) is the second 
most prevalent infection of deeper structures of the distal limb in cattle, 
after septic arthritis of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Depending on 
the type of infection and the involvement of adjacent anatomical structures, 
various surgical techniques may be used for therapy: Incising the DFTS to resect 
one or both digital flexor tendons (RDFT), additional resection of the DIP joint 
(RDIP) or additional digital amputation (RAMP). Our goal was to describe 
clinical findings and outcome in cattle patients (euthanasia vs. treatment) and 
the success of surgical methods including improvement of locomotion and 
postoperative survival time (POST). Data of eighty-three cattle with a mean age 
of 4.3 years were reviewed in this retrospective study. Overall, 57.7% of 
tenosynovitis cases were in the lateral DFTS of a hind limb. Fifty-five cattle 
were treated surgically; the remaining 28 cattle were euthanized following 
diagnosis. The median cumulative POST was 17.3, 83.1, and 11.9 months for RDFT, 
RDIP, and RAMP, respectively. Fatal postoperative complications occurred in 
three cattle. We conclude that the applied methods were successful and allowed 
the animals to almost reach the average life expectancy of an Austrian dairy 
cow.

Symmetry Breaking during Cell Movement in the Context of Excitability, Kinetic 
Fine-Tuning and Memory of Pseudopod Formation.

The path of moving eukaryotic cells depends on the kinetics and direction of 
extending pseudopods. Amoeboid cells constantly change their shape with 
pseudopods extending in different directions. Detailed analysis has revealed 
that time, place and direction of pseudopod extension are not random, but highly 
ordered with strong prevalence for only one extending pseudopod, with defined 
life-times, and with reoccurring events in time and space indicative of memory. 
Important components are Ras activation and the formation of branched F-actin in 
the extending pseudopod and inhibition of pseudopod formation in the contractile 
cortex of parallel F-actin/myosin. In biology, order very often comes with 
symmetry. In this essay, I discuss cell movement and the dynamics of pseudopod 
extension from the perspective of symmetry and symmetry changes of Ras 
activation and the formation of branched F-actin in the extending pseudopod. 
Combining symmetry of Ras activation with kinetics and memory of pseudopod 
extension results in a refined model of amoeboid movement that appears to be 
largely conserved in the fast moving Dictyostelium and neutrophils, the slow 
moving mesenchymal stem cells and the fungus B.d. chytrid.

Numerical Analysis of Fatigue Crack Growth Path and Life Predictions for Linear 
Elastic Material.

The main objective of this work was to present a numerical modelling of crack 
growth path in linear elastic materials under mixed-mode loadings, as well as to 
study the effect of presence of a hole on fatigue crack propagation and fatigue 
life in a modified compact tension specimen under constant amplitude loading 
condition. The ANSYS Mechanical APDL 19.2 is implemented for accurate prediction 
of the crack propagation paths and the associated fatigue life under constant 
amplitude loading conditions using a new feature in ANSYS which is the smart 
crack growth technique. The Paris law model has been employed for the evaluation 
of the mixed-mode fatigue life for the modified compact tension specimen (MCTS) 
with different configuration of MCTS under the linear elastic fracture mechanics 
(LEFM) assumption. The approach involves accurate evaluation of stress intensity 
factors (SIFs), path of crack growth and a fatigue life evaluation through an 
incremental crack extension analysis. Fatigue crack growth results indicate that 
the fatigue crack has always been attracted to the hole, so either it can only 
curve its path and propagate towards the hole, or it can only float from the 
hole and grow further once the hole has been lost. In terms of trajectories of 
crack propagation under mixed-mode load conditions, the results of this study 
are validated with several crack propagation experiments published in literature 
showing the similar observations. Accurate results of the predicted fatigue life 
were achieved compared to the two-dimensional data performed by other 
researchers.

BACKGROUND: The association between obesity and a reduction in life expectancy 
is well established, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality. 
Bariatric surgery has long been established as the most effective and durable 
intervention for obesity, and is the only intervention for obesity that 
consistently improves multiple comorbidities, reduces cardiovascular disease and 
long-term mortality. The purpose of this review is to describe the impact of 
metabolic/bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic 
parameters, including cardiovascular mortality.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of Pubmed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central 
Register was performed. We included randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, 
case-control trials, and cohort studies that contain data on reductions in 
cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular mortality in subjects who 
underwent metabolic/bariatric surgery from January 1, 2005 to June 1, 2020.
CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials that 
metabolic/bariatric surgery is associated with a significant improvement of all 
cardiovascular risk factors. Although studies are showing a reduction of 
macrovascular events and cardiovascular mortality, these findings come from 
observational studies and should be confirmed in randomized clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: As the cost-effectiveness evaluation of cinacalcet and conventional 
therapy in China has not been reported, the objective of this study was to make 
a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of cinacalcet specific to the Chinese healthcare 
setting in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) 
undergoing dialysis.
DESIGNS: Data from Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular 
Events trial were used for this analysis. A semi-Markov model was constructed to 
estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs in cinacalcet 
plus conventional therapy (cinacalcet strategy) compared with conventional 
therapy (standard strategy), in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing 
dialysis. Treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis and covariate-adjusted ITT analysis were used as the main analyses. 
Model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall decision 
uncertainty were assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) as measured by cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The ICER for cinacalcet strategy was US$44 400 per QALY gained using 
the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
suggested a 46.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of US$26 508. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of 
US$87 210 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence does not support the cost-effectiveness of 
cinacalcet strategy in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing dialysis 
when applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26 508 per QALY, whether it 
is using the treatment effect from covariate-adjusted ITT analysis or unadjusted 
ITT analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Extant international research suggests that people with severe and 
enduring mental illness (PWSEMI) experience increased rates of chronic physical 
illness (CPI), reduced life expectancy and higher mortality than those in the 
general population. The high prevalence of CPI among PWSEMI is associated with a 
number of barriers that this population experiences when accessing physical 
healthcare. Although substantial research has been conducted in North America, 
Europe and Australia, there appears to be a paucity of research exploring CPI 
among PWSEMI in the Caribbean region, although this region has reported very 
high rates of non-communicable diseases within its populations. The current 
study will be situated in Jamaica and will explore the enablers and barriers to 
PWSEMI accessing healthcare for CPI.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A convergent mixed-method design will explore the enablers 
and barriers to accessing healthcare for CPI among PWSEMI. This cross-sectional 
study will collect data from PWSEMI, caregivers and family members, community 
health aides, primary care physicians, psychiatrists and health policymakers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study findings will provide baseline data 
describing the prevalence of CPI among PWSEMI in Jamaica and will identify 
enablers for, and barriers to, PWSEMI accessing CPI care. Findings will be 
disseminated widely in Jamaica and internationally to key stakeholders through 
publications and conferences. Institutional ethical approval was granted from 
Jamaica's Ministry of Health and Wellness Medico-legal Ethics Review Panel (# 
2019/49), the Curtin University Human Research and Ethics Committee (HRE 
2020-0022) and the University of the West Indies FMS Ethics Committee (ECP 101,

OBJECTIVES: Niraparib maintenance after frontline chemotherapy for advanced 
ovarian cancer extends progression free survival. The objective of this study 
was to determine the cost effectiveness of niraparib maintenance therapy in 
patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Decision analysis models compared the cost of observation versus 
niraparib maintenance following chemotherapy for five groups: all newly 
diagnosed ovarian cancer patients (overall), those with homologous recombination 
deficiency, those harboring BRCA mutations (BRCA), homologous recombination 
deficiency patients without BRCA mutations (homologous recombination deficiency 
non-BRCA), and non-homologous recombination deficiency patients. Drug costs were 
estimated using average wholesale prices. Progression free survival was 
estimated from published data and used to estimate projected overall survival. 
Incremental cost effectiveness ratios per quality adjusted life year were 
calculated. Sensitivity analyses varying the cost of niraparib were performed. 
The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at US$100 000 per quality adjusted life 
year saved.
RESULTS: For the overall group, the cost of observation was US$5.8 billion 
versus $20.5 billion for niraparib maintenance, with an incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of $72 829. For the homologous recombination deficiency 
group, the observation cost was $3.0 billion versus $14.8 billion for niraparib 
maintenance (incremental cost effectiveness ratio $56 329). Incremental cost 
effectiveness ratios for the BRCA, homologous recombination deficiency non-BRCA, 
and non-homologous recombination deficiency groups were $58 348, $50 914, and 
$88 741, respectively. For the overall and homologous recombination deficiency 
groups, niraparib remained cost effective if projected overall survival was 2.2 
and 1.5 times progression free survival, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, maintenance 
therapy with niraparib was cost effective. Cost effectiveness was improved when 
analyzing those patients with homologous recombination deficiency and BRCA 
mutations. Efforts should continue to optimize poly-ADP-ribose polymerase
