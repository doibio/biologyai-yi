IMPORTANCE: Cancer and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are now widely 
recognized as a threat to global development. The latest United Nations 
high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the 
slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and 
Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. 
Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been 
identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in 
common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial 
data.
OBJECTIVE: To describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 
1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer 
incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Results are presented at the national 
level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of 
income, educational attainment, and total fertility rate. We also analyzed the 
influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer 
incidence.
FINDINGS: In 2017, there were 24.5 million incident cancer cases worldwide (16.8 
million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and 9.6 million cancer deaths. 
The majority of cancer DALYs came from years of life lost (97%), and only 3% 
came from years lived with disability. The odds of developing cancer were the 
lowest in the low SDI quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high SDI quintile 
(1 in 2) for both sexes. In 2017, the most common incident cancers in men were 
NMSC (4.3 million incident cases); tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer 
(1.5 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (1.3 million incident cases). 
The most common causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for men were TBL cancer (1.3 
million deaths and 28.4 million DALYs), liver cancer (572 000 deaths and 15.2 
million DALYs), and stomach cancer (542 000 deaths and 12.2 million DALYs). For 
women in 2017, the most common incident cancers were NMSC (3.3 million incident 
cases), breast cancer (1.9 million incident cases), and colorectal cancer 
(819 000 incident cases). The leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for 
women were breast cancer (601 000 deaths and 17.4 million DALYs), TBL cancer 
(596 000 deaths and 12.6 million DALYs), and colorectal cancer (414 000 deaths 
and 8.3 million DALYs).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The national epidemiological profiles of cancer 
burden in the GBD study show large heterogeneities, which are a reflection of 
different exposures to risk factors, economic settings, lifestyles, and access 
to care and screening. The GBD study can be used by policy makers and other 
stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order 
to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are underutilized in 
Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The Improve 
SCA Study is the largest prospective study to evaluate the benefit of ICD 
therapy in underrepresented geographies. This analysis reports the primary 
objective of the study.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study was to determine whether patients with 
primary prevention (PP) indications with specific risk factors (1.5PP: syncope, 
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions >10/h, 
and low ventricular ejection fraction <25%) are at a similar risk of 
life-threatening arrhythmias as patients with secondary prevention (SP) 
indications and to evaluate all-cause mortality rates in 1.5PP patients with and 
without devices.
METHODS: A total of 3889 patients were included in the analysis to evaluate 
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation therapy and mortality rates. Patients 
were stratified as SP (n = 1193) and patients with PP indications. The PP cohort 
was divided into 1.5PP patients (n = 1913) and those without any 1.5PP criteria 
(n = 783). The decision to undergo ICD implantation was left to the patient 
and/or physician. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute hazard 
ratios.
RESULTS: Patients had predominantly nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The rate of 
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 1.5PP patients was not equivalent 
(within 30%) to that in patients with SP indications (hazard ratio 0.47; 95% 
confidence interval 0.38-0.57) but was higher than that in PP patients without 
any 1.5PP criteria (hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.97) (P = 
.03). There was a 49% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in ICD 
implanted 1.5PP patients. In addition, the number needed to treat to save 1 life 
over 3 years was 10.0 in the 1.5PP cohort vs 40.0 in PP patients without any 
1.5PP criteria.
CONCLUSION: These data corroborate the mortality benefit of ICD therapy and 
support extension to a selected PP population from underrepresented geographies.

Introduction: Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is an extremely rare medicinal fungus 
native to forested regions of Taiwan. It possesses numerous biological 
activities, especially anti-tumor effects shown in various in vitro cancer cells 
and in vivo animal models. However, there are few clinical reports about AC as a 
treatment for cancer patients. This report attempts to demonstrate the 
therapeutic effect of dish-cultured AC (DAC) on a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
patient taken orally for an extended duration. Patient concerns: An 88-year-old 
male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension visited the outpatient 
department with the symptoms of dyspnea and a cough for two weeks. After a 
diagnosis of SCLC, the patient declined both chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
because of the side effects and only accepted supportive care without additional 
therapy. Diagnosis: Limited-stage SCLC (T4N2M1a, stage IV) after the chest 
radiograph, computed tomography-guided biopsy, and pathological diagnosis. 
Interventions: The patient was prescribed DAC with an increasing dosage, from 5 
g/d up to 10 g/d DAC, for six months, without radiation or chemotherapy 
treatment. Outcomes: DAC caused the tumor to shrink substantially. Surprisingly, 
the patient survived for 32 months without relapse after six months of DAC 
treatment. Laboratory examinations indicated that the patient's health had 
improved significantly, reverting to near normal levels. Notably, he had a good 
quality of life with a high Barthel index score. Unfortunately, this patient 
died of septic shock caused by acute cholangitis. Conclusion: DAC may exert an 
anti-cancer effect, which can lead to tumor regression. This is supposed to be 
achieved by the combined DAC's immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, 
anti-metastatic, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic effects mediated through 
multiple signaling pathways. We propose that DAC can be used as a complementary 
medicine to prolong the life expectancy and improve the life quality of SCLC 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Neck pain is one of the major conditions attributing to overall 
disability in the United States. There have been multiple publications assessing 
clinical and cost effectiveness of multiple modalities of interventions in 
managing chronic neck pain. Even then, the literature has been considered sparse 
in relation to cervical interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic 
neck pain. In contrast, cost utility studies of lumbar interlaminar injections, 
caudal epidural injections, cervical and lumbar facet joint nerve blocks, 
percutaneous adhesiolysis demonstrated costs of less than $3,500 for 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural 
injections in managing chronic neck and/or upper extremity pain secondary to 
cervical disc herniation, post-surgery syndrome in neck, and axial or discogenic 
neck pain.
STUDY DESIGN: Analysis based on 3 previously published randomized trials of the 
effectiveness of cervical interlaminar epidural injections assessing their role 
in disc herniation, cervical post-surgery syndrome, and axial or discogenic 
pain.
SETTING: A contemporary, private, specialty referral interventional pain 
management center in the United States.
METHODS: Cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural injections with or 
without steroids in managing cervical disc herniation, cervical post-surgery 
syndrome, and cervical discogenic or axial neck back pain was conducted with 
data derived from 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included a 2-year 
follow-up, with inclusion of 356 patients. The primary outcome was significant 
improvement defined as at least 50% in pain reduction and disability status. 
Direct payment data from all carriers from 2018 was utilized for the assessment 
of procedural costs. Overall costs, including drug costs, were determined by 
multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a factor of 1.67 to 
accommodate for indirect payments respectively for disc herniation, discogenic 
pain, and cervical post-surgery syndrome.
RESULTS: The results of the 3 RCTs showed direct cost utility for one year of 
QALY of $2,412.31 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, 
$2,081.07 for disc herniation, and $2,309.20 for post surgery syndrome, with an 
average cost per one year QALY of $2,267.57, with total estimated overall costs 
with addition of indirect costs of $3,475.38, $4,028.55, $3,856.36, and 
$3,785.89 respectively.
LIMITATIONS: The limitation of this cost utility analysis includes that it is a 
single center evaluation. Indirect costs were extrapolated.
CONCLUSION: This cost utility analysis of cervical interlaminar epidural 
injections in patients nonresponsive to conservative management in the treatment 
of disc herniation, post surgery syndrome and axial or discogenic neck pain 
shows $2,267.57 for direct costs with a total cost of $3,785.89 per QALY.
KEY WORDS: Cervical interlaminar epidural injections, chronic neck pain, 
cervical disc herniation, cervical discogenic pain, post surgery syndrome, cost 
utility analysis, cost effectiveness analysis, quality-adjusted life years.

BACKGROUND: The spine is the most common site of skeletal metastatic disease. 
Vertebral body metastases (VBM) can cause crippling pain, fractures, and spinal 
cord compression. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive 
technique that has proven to be a safe method of targeted tissue destruction. 
Studies have shown that RFA combined with cement vertebral augmentation is safe 
and effective and has been associated with significant improvements in pain and 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was continued evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy of this technique.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
SETTING: A single academic medical center.
METHODS: Patients undergoing RFA with cement vertebral augmentation for a 
painful thoracic or lumbar VBM were eligible for inclusion. Additional inclusion 
criteria included pain concordant with a metastatic lesion on cross-sectional 
imaging, aged 18 years or older, and considered candidates for spinal tumor 
ablation by the operating physician. Patients with vertebral metastatic disease 
in the cervical spine or patients with spinal cord compression from posterior 
tumor extension were excluded. Ablation within each VBM was performed using a 
bipolar radiofrequency probe with an extensible electrode and available 
articulation, permitting vertebral body navigation percutaneously. Patients were 
evaluated at baseline, 3 days, one week, one month, and 3 months using the 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-General 7 (FACT-G7) to assess pain and quality-of-life, respectively. A 
one-sample t test was performed, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to 
assess changes in average NRS-11 and FACT-G7 scores.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients met inclusion criteria and underwent RFA of one 
or more VBM. Patients with 13 different primary cancers types underwent 
treatment. Patients received RFA to either one (n = 26; 87%) or 2 vertebral body 
levels (n = 4; 13%). Of the 34 levels, 13 were thoracic vertebra (38%) and 21 
were lumbar vertebra (62%). Average NRS-11 scores decreased from a baseline of 
5.77 to 4.65 (3 days; P = 0.16), 3.33 (one week; P < 0.01), 2.64 (one month; P < 
0.01), and 2.61 (3 months; P < 0.01). FACT-G7 increased from a baseline average 
of 13.0 to 14.7 (3 days; P = 0.13), 14.69 (one week; P = 0.15), 14.04 (one 
month; P = 0.35), and 15.11 (3 months; P = 0.07). No major adverse events were 
reported.
LIMITATIONS: A heterogeneous patient population, small sample size, and 
potential confounders of concurrent variable adjuvant therapies were 
limitations. Additionally, most patients received both cement augmentation and 
targeted RFA, making it difficult to distinguish independent analgesic benefits 
of the therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that minimally invasive targeted RFA with 
cement augmentation of spinal metastatic lesions is an effective treatment for 
patients with VBM.
KEY WORDS: Cancer, cancer pain, spinal metastasis, radiofrequency ablation, 
tumor ablation, cement augmentation.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
empagliflozin in Japan based on the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial.
METHODS: The trial has shown a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular (CV) and 
renal events with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
established CV disease. A cost-effectiveness analysis based on the overall 
population of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial was reported previously by using a 
lifetime discrete event simulation model. The same modeling frame was adapted to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with empagliflozin added to 
standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC alone in Japan. The time to relevant 
clinical events and the hazard ratios were derived from an Asian subpopulation 
in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. The costs for each event were estimated from a 
Japanese medical claims database. Direct medical costs, life expectancy, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the public health care 
perspective.
FINDINGS: Treatment with empagliflozin was estimated to increase life expectancy 
by 6.2 years and 2.7 QALYs, whereas total cost increased by 1,115,475 yen 
compared with treatment with SoC alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was 415,849 yen/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, there was no case that was in 
excess of the reference value of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in the 
pilot introduction for price revision in Japan (ie, 5 million yen/QALY).
IMPLICATIONS: Based on the Asian subpopulation in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 
our results suggest that empagliflozin added to SoC is highly cost-effective 
compared with SoC alone in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Depressed patients often focus on negative life events. Effective 
antidepressant therapy reverses this negative emotional bias (NEB) within 
1 week. Clinical therapeutic effect usually requires 4-6 weeks. The value of 
implementing NEB monitoring for the personalisation of antidepressant therapy is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the likely outcome and cost consequences of adopting the 
P1vital Oxford Emotional Test Battery (ETB) for this purpose in routine primary 
care in England.
METHODS: A hybrid decision analytic model (decision tree plus Markov model) was 
developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ETB monitoring versus no ETB 
over 52 weeks using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Differences in 
depression severity, episode type and analytical perspectives were considered. 
Input data were derived from relevant guidelines, literature, national 
databases, expert opinion and the developers for the year 2013. Multiple 
sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty.
FINDINGS: The mean number of ETB tests is 2.162 per newly diagnosed patient and 
2.166 per patient with recurrent depression. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
of ETB versus 'no ETB' is £4355/QALY from the healthcare perspective. From the 
broader societal perspective, ETB is more effective and cost saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring negative emotional bias in primary care in England for 
personalised antidepressant treatment using ETB seems as an effective and 
cost-effective option under all considered scenarios (including worst case). Its 
main economic value seems to lie in reduced productivity loss as opposed to 
healthcare savings.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The test supports accelerated application of 
evidence-based depression care. Further optimisation and implementation in the 
ongoing European PReDicT trial is ongoing.

AURKA is a serine/threonine kinase overexpressed in several cancers. Originally 
identified as a protein with multifaceted roles during mitosis, improvements in 
quantitative microscopy uncovered several non-mitotic roles as well. In 
physiological conditions, AURKA regulates cilia disassembly, neurite extension, 
cell motility, DNA replication and senescence programs. In cancer-like contexts, 
AURKA actively promotes DNA repair, it acts as a transcription factor, promotes 
cell migration and invasion, and it localises at mitochondria to regulate 
mitochondrial dynamics and ATP production. Here we review the non-mitotic roles 
of AURKA, and its partners outside of cell division. In addition, we give an 
insight into how structural data and quantitative fluorescence microscopy 
allowed to understand AURKA activation and its interaction with new substrates, 
highlighting future developments in fluorescence microscopy needed to better 
understand AURKA functions in vivo. Last, we will recapitulate the most 
significant AURKA inhibitors currently in clinical trials, and we will explore 
how the non-mitotic roles of the kinase may provide new insights to ameliorate 
current pharmacological strategies against AURKA overexpression.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been hugely successful in reducing 
the mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
resulting in a growing population of people living with HIV (PLWH). Since PLWH 
now have a longer life expectancy, chronic comorbidities have become the focus 
of the clinical management of HIV. For example, cardiovascular complications are 
now one of the most prevalent causes of death in PLWH. Numerous epidemiological 
studies show that antiretroviral treatment increases cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk and early onset of CVD in PLWH. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of cART, and two NRTIs are typically used in 
combination with one drug from another drug class, e.g., a fusion inhibitor. 
NRTIs are known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to toxicity in 
numerous tissues, such as myopathy, lipoatrophy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In 
in vitro studies, short-term NRTI treatment induces an endothelial dysfunction 
with an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; long-term NRTI 
treatment decreases cell replication capacity, while increasing mtROS production 
and senescent cell accumulation. These findings suggest that a mitochondrial 
oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of NRTI-induced endothelial 
dysfunction and premature senescence. Mitochondrial dysfunction, defined by a 
compromised mitochondrial quality control via biogenesis and mitophagy, has a 
causal role in premature endothelial senescence and can potentially initiate 
early cardiovascular disease (CVD) development in PLWH. In this review, we 
explore the hypothesis and present literature supporting that long-term NRTI 
treatment induces vascular dysfunction by interfering with endothelial 
mitochondrial homeostasis and provoking mitochondrial genomic instability, 
resulting in premature endothelial senescence.

BACKGROUND: Ninety-four percent of congenital anomalies occur in low- and 
middle-income countries. In Uganda, only three pediatric surgeons and three 
pediatric anesthesiologists serve more than 20 million children. This study 
estimates burden, outcomes, coverage, and economic benefit of neonatal surgical 
conditions in Uganda.
METHODS: A prospectively collected database was reviewed for neonatal surgical 
admissions from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, at the only two sites 
with specialist pediatric surgical coverage. Outcomes were compared with 
high-income countries. Met and unmet need were estimated using 
disability-adjusted life years. Economic benefit was estimated using a value of 
statistical life-year approach.
RESULTS: For 1313 neonatal admissions, the median age of presentation was 3 d, 
overall mortality was 36%, and median distance traveled was 40 km. Anorectal 
malformations were most common (18%). Postoperative mortality was 24%. Mortality 
was significantly associated with surgical intervention (P < 0.0001). Met need 
was 4181 disability-adjusted life years per year, which corresponds to a $3.5 
million net economic benefit to Uganda, with a potential additional benefit of 
$153 million if unmet need were fully addressed. Approximately 2% of the total 
need is met by the health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal surgery is associated with improved survival for most 
conditions. Despite increases in workforce and infrastructure, a limited 
proportion of the need for neonatal surgery is currently being met. This is 
multifactorial, including lack of access to surgical care and severe shortages 
of workforce and infrastructure. Current and potential economic benefit to 
Uganda appears substantial.

PURPOSE AND SETTING: Despite the label "generic" health state utility 
instruments (HSUIs), empirical evidence shows that different HSUIs generate 
different estimates of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in the same 
person. Once a HSUI is used to generate a QALY, the difference between HSUIs is 
often ignored, and decision-makers act as if 'a QALY is a QALY is a QALY'. 
Complementing evidence that different generic HSUIs produce different empirical 
values, this study addresses an important gap by exploring how HSUIs differ, and 
processes that produced this difference. 15 developers of six generic HSUIs used 
for estimating the QOL component of QALYs: Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale; 15
