Al-Qassim. Research assistants recruited participants in all the mosques from 
the randomly selected neighborhoods (16 of 95). They administered a structured 
questionnaire that assessed self-reported disease history (heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, asthma, gastric/peptic ulcer, and cancer), and 
medication use; participants' height, weight, blood pressure, and random blood 
glucose (glucometer) were measured. Multinomial logistic regressions were 
employed to assess correlates of number of chronic diseases.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation for age and body mass index (BMI) were 
63.0 ± 7.5 years and 28.9 ± 4.8 (kg/m2), respectively. 78% (77.8%) were 
overweight or obese, 35.0% were employed, 54.5% walked daily, 9.3% were current 
smokers, and 85.0% belonged to the middle class. The prevalence of hypertension, 
diabetes, heart disease, asthma, ulcer, and cancer were: 71.3% 27.3%, 16.4%, 
9.7%, 8.9%, and 2.0%, respectively. Of the participants, 31.0% had one, 34.5% 
had two or more, and 34.5% did not have any chronic diseases. The likelihood of 
chronic diseases increased with increased age, higher BMI, and current smoking.
CONCLUSION: The chronic disease prevalence among the Saudi elderly men is 
substantial.

As far back as the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, microbial 
infections were responsible for vast numbers of deaths. The trend reversed with 
the introduction of antibiotics coinciding with longer life. Increased life 
expectancy however, accompanied the emergence of age related chronic 
inflammatory states including the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Taken together, the true challenge of retaining health into later years of life 
now appears to lie in delaying and/or preventing the progression of chronic 
inflammatory diseases, through identifying and influencing modifiable risk 
factors. Diverse pathogens, including periodontal bacteria have been associated 
with AD brains. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) hallmark protein of AD may be a consequence of 
infection, called upon due to its antimicrobial properties. Up to this moment in 
time, a lack of understanding and knowledge of a microbiome associated with AD 
brain has ensured that the role pathogens may play in this neurodegenerative 
disease remains unresolved. The oral microbiome embraces a range of diverse 
bacterial phylotypes, which especially in vulnerable individuals, will excite 
and perpetuate a range of inflammatory conditions, to a wide range of extra-oral 
body tissues and organs specific to their developing pathophysiology, including 
the brain. This offers the tantalizing opportunity that by controlling the 
oral-specific microbiome; clinicians may treat or prevent a range of chronic 
inflammatory diseases orally. Evolution has equipped the human host to combat 
infection/disease by providing an immune system, but Porphyromonas gingivalis 
and selective spirochetes, have developed immune avoidance strategies 
threatening the host-microbe homeostasis. It is clear from longitudinal 
monitoring of patients that chronic periodontitis contributes to declining 
cognition. The aim here is to discuss the contribution from opportunistic 
pathogens of the periodontal microbiome, and highlight the challenges, the host 
faces, when dealing with unresolvable oral infections that may lead to clinical 
manifestations that are characteristic for AD.

IMPORTANCE: Influenza is a significant public health burden, causing morbidity 
and mortality in children, yet vaccination rates remain low. Vaccination in the 
pediatric emergency department (PED) setting may be beneficial but, to date, has 
not been proven to be cost-effective.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 strategies for PED-based 
influenza vaccine: offering vaccine to all patients, only to patients younger 
than 5 years, only to high-risk patients (all ages), or to no patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using commercial decision analysis software, 
a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from January 1, 2016, to June 1, 
2017, to compare influenza vaccine strategies at a tertiary, urban, freestanding 
PED with an estimated 60 000 visits per year among a hypothetical cohort of 
children visiting the above PED during influenza season. Sensitivity analyses 
estimated the effect of uncertainties across a variety of input variables (eg, 
influenza prevalence, vaccine price and effectiveness, and costs of 
complications).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were cost and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per influenza case averted. Secondary 
outcomes included total societal costs, hospitalizations and deaths averted, and 
quality-adjusted life-years gained.
RESULTS: Offering influenza vaccine to all eligible patients has the lowest 
cost, at $114.45 (95% CI, $55.48-$245.45) per case of influenza averted. This 
strategy saves $33.51 (95% CI, $18-$62) per case averted compared with no 
vaccination, and averages 27 fewer cases of influenza per 1000 patients. 
Offering vaccine to all patients resulted in 0.72 days (95% CI, 0.18-1.78 days) 
of quality-adjusted life-years lost, whereas offering to none resulted in 0.91 
days (95% CI, 0.25-2.2 days) of quality-adjusted life-years lost. In sensitivity 
analyses, this strategy remains robustly cost-effective across a wide range of 
assumptions. In addition to being the most cost-effective strategy regardless of 
age or risk status, routine vaccination in the PED results in a net societal 
monetary benefit under many circumstances. In Monte Carlo analysis, offering 
vaccine to all patients was superior to other strategies in at least 99.8% of 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although few PEDs routinely offer influenza 
vaccination, doing so appears to be cost-effective, with the potential to 
significantly reduce the economic (and patient) burden of pediatric influenza.

Impaired p53/CEP-1 is associated with lifespan extension through an age-related 
imbalance in the energy metabolism of C. elegans.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mammalian tumor suppressor p53 
ortholog CEP-1 mediates the stress response, activates germ line apoptosis and 
regulates meiotic chromosome segregation. A reduction in its expression, which 
frequently occurs in mammalian cancer cells, extends lifespan and induces an 
adaptive response in C. elegans. However, these effects do not involve an 
increase in oxidative stress resistance. Here, we showed that intermittent 
exposure to hyperoxia, which induces oxidative stress resistance and lowers the 
production of ROS derived from mitochondrial respiration in C. elegans, slightly 
improved the lifespan extension of cep-1 mutant. Interestingly, ATP levels were 
increased without an increase in oxygen consumption in cep-1 mutant during 
aging. In the wild-type, lactate levels and consequentially the lactate/pyruvate 
ratio decreased during aging in adults. Furthermore, the expression levels of 
mitochondrial respiration-related sco-1, which is a target of p53/CEP-1, as well 
as those of gluconeogenesis regulation and mammalian sirtuin ortholog genes, 
were also increased in the aged and adaptive conditioned wild-type animals. In 
contrast, the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased in cells of the cep-1 mutant and 
was amplified by intermittent hyperoxia. These results suggest that impaired 
p53/CEP-1 leads to an imbalance in the age-related energy metabolic alteration 
between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis and plays 
an important role in the extension of both intact and adaptive lifespans.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited multisystem disorder 
caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Respiratory failure remains the most 
frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Lung transplantation is the only 
option to treat end-stage lung disease. Very few cases of CF occur in Koreans. 
We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with respiratory failure due to CF who 
underwent lung transplantation. She had been diagnosed with CF 8 years 
previously after being treated for recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia 
and malnutrition based on sweat chloride concentrations and the CFTR protein 
gene mutation test. Progression to end-stage lung disease and respiratory 
failure led to registration with the Korean Network for Organ Sharing. She 
underwent successful double lung transplantation in 2014. Although she has 
diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, she has a better quality of life 
and a prolonged life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic diseases, such as immune, neurobehavioral, 
and metabolic disorders has increased in recent decades. According to the 
concept of Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD), developmental 
factors associated with environmental exposures and maternal lifestyle choices 
may partly explain the observed increase. Register-based epidemiology is a prime 
tool to investigate the effects of prenatal exposures over the whole life 
course. Our aim is to establish a Finnish register-based birth cohort, which can 
be used to investigate various (prenatal) exposures and their effects during the 
whole life course with first analyses focusing on maternal smoking and air 
pollution. In this paper we (i) review previous studies to identify knowledge 
gaps and overlaps available for cross-validation, (ii) lay out the MATEX study 
plan for register linkages, and (iii) analyse the study power of the baseline 
MATEX cohort for selected endpoints identified from the international 
literature.
METHODS/DESIGN: The MATEX cohort is a fully register-based cohort identified 
from the Finnish Medical Birth Register (MBR) (1987-2015). Information from the 
MBR will be linked with other Finnish health registers and the population 
register to link the cohort with air quality data. Epidemiological analyses will 
be conducted for maternal smoking and air pollution and a range of health 
endpoints.
DISCUSSION: The MATEX cohort consists of 1.75 million mother-child pairs with a 
maximum follow up time of 29 years. This makes the cohort big enough to reach 
sufficient statistical power to investigate rare outcomes, such as birth 
anomalies, childhood cancers, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The 
linkage between different registers allows for an extension of the scope of the 
cohort and a follow up from the prenatal period to decades later in life.

Gastrulation is a fundamental morphogenetic event that requires polarised cell 
behaviours for coordinated asymmetric cell movements. Wnt/PCP signalling plays a 
critical role in this process. Dishevelled is an important conserved scaffold 
protein that relays Wnt/PCP signals from membrane receptors to the modulation of 
cytoskeleton organisation. However, it remains unclear how its activity is 
regulated for the activation of downstream effectors. Here, we report that 
Lurap1 is a Dishevelled-interacting protein that regulates Wnt/PCP signalling in 
convergence and extension movements during vertebrate gastrulation. Its 
loss-of-function leads to enhanced Dishevelled membrane localisation and 
increased JNK activity. In maternal-zygotic lurap1 mutant zebrafish embryos, 
cell polarity and directional movement are disrupted. Time-lapse analyses 
indicate that Lurap1, Dishevelled, and JNK functionally interact to orchestrate 
polarised cellular protrusive activity, and Lurap1 is required for coordinated 
centriole/MTOC positioning in movement cells. These findings demonstrate that 
Lurap1 functions to regulate cellular polarisation and motile behaviours during 
gastrulation movements.

Strength training is a valuable component of hamstring strain injury prevention 
programmes; however, in recent years a significant body of work has emerged to 
suggest that the acute responses and chronic adaptations to training with 
different exercises are heterogeneous. Unfortunately, these research findings do 
not appear to have uniformly influenced clinical guidelines for exercise 
selection in hamstring injury prevention or rehabilitation programmes. The 
purpose of this review was to provide the practitioner with an evidence-base 
from which to prescribe strengthening exercises to mitigate the risk of 
hamstring injury. Several studies have established that eccentric knee flexor 
conditioning reduces the risk of hamstring strain injury when compliance is 
adequate. The benefits of this type of training are likely to be at least partly 
mediated by increases in biceps femoris long head fascicle length and 
improvements in eccentric knee flexor strength. Therefore, selecting exercises 
with a proven benefit on these variables should form the basis of effective 
injury prevention protocols. In addition, a growing body of work suggests that 
the patterns of hamstring muscle activation diverge significantly between 
different exercises. Typically, relatively higher levels of biceps femoris long 
head and semimembranosus activity have been observed during hip 
extension-oriented movements, whereas preferential semitendinosus and biceps 
femoris short head activation have been reported during knee flexion-oriented 
movements. These findings may have implications for targeting specific muscles 
in injury prevention programmes. An evidence-based approach to strength training 
for the prevention of hamstring strain injury should consider the impact of 
exercise selection on muscle activation, and the effect of training 
interventions on hamstring muscle architecture, morphology and function. Most 
importantly, practitioners should consider the effect of a strength training 
programme on known or proposed risk factors for hamstring injury.

Air pollution is a significant public health issue all over the world, 
especially in urban areas where a large number of inhabitants are affected. In 
this study, we quantify the health burden due to local air pollution for Warsaw, 
Poland. The health impact of the main air pollutants, PM, NOX, SO₂, CO, C₆H₆, 
BaP and heavy metals is considered. The annual mean concentrations are predicted 
with the CALPUFF air quality modeling system using the year 2012 emission and 
meteorological data. The emission field comprises point, mobile and area 
sources. The exposure to these pollutants was estimated using population data 
with a spatial resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 km². Changes in mortality and in 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated with relative risk 
functions obtained from literature. It has been predicted that local emissions 
cause approximately 1600 attributable deaths and 29,000 DALYs per year. About 
80% of the health burden was due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). 
Mobile and area sources contributed 46% and 52% of total DALYs, respectively. 
When the inflow from outside was included, the burden nearly doubled to 51,000 
DALYs. These results indicate that local decisions can potentially reduce 
associated negative health effects, but a national-level policy is required for 
reducing the strong environmental impact of PM emissions.

Fumigant toxicity and sublethal effects of essential oils from Artemisia 
khorassanica Podl. and Artemisia sieberi Bess were investigated against adults 
of Sitotroga cerealella Olivier. To assess the sublethal effects, adult moths 
were exposed to the LC30 of each essential oil, and life table parameters of the 
surviving S. cerealella were studied. Higher fumigant toxicity of A. 
khorassanica (LC50: 7.38 µl/liter air) than A. sieberi (LC50: 9.26 µl/liter air) 
was observed against S. cerealella. Also, the insecticidal effects of A. 
khorassanica (LT50: 9.01 h) were faster than A. sieberi (LT50: 14.37 h). A 
significant extension was observed in the developmental time (egg to adult) of 
S. cerealella treated with the essential oils. In addition, fecundity of S. 
cerealella reduced by 25.29 and 35.78% following exposure to sublethal 
concentrations of A. sieberi and A. khorassanica, respectively. Both tested 
essential oils caused a significant reduction in the gross and net reproductive 
rates, intrinsic rate of increase (rm), and finite rate of increase of S. 
cerealella. The rm values following exposure to A. sieberi, A. khorassanica, and 
control were 0.098, 0.094, and 0.107 d-1, respectively. The results of this 
study suggest that tested essential oils have a good potential to apply in 
integrated pest management of S. cerealella.

In industrialized countries, the most common etiology of mitral regurgitation 
(MR) is degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease. The natural history of severe 
degenerative MR is poor. However, its appropriate and timely correction is 
associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. 
Surgical MV repair is the gold standard treatment. This review will focus on the 
most recent evidence with a specific emphasis on surgical indications, timing of 
treatment, contemporary surgical techniques, Heart Teams and Centers of 
Excellence.

BACKGROUND: The expected value of sample information (EVSI) can help prioritize 
research but its application is hampered by computational infeasibility, 
especially for complex models. We investigated an approach by Strong and 
colleagues to estimate EVSI by applying generalized additive models (GAM) to 
results generated from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
METHODS: For 3 potential HIV prevention and treatment strategies, we estimated 
life expectancy and lifetime costs using the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing 
AIDS Complications (CEPAC) model, a complex patient-level microsimulation model 
of HIV progression. We fitted a GAM-a flexible regression model that estimates 
the functional form as part of the model fitting process-to the incremental net 
monetary benefits obtained from the CEPAC PSA. For each case study, we 
calculated the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) using both 
the conventional nested Monte Carlo approach and the GAM approach. EVSI was 
calculated using the GAM approach.
RESULTS: For all 3 case studies, the GAM approach consistently gave similar 
estimates of EVPPI compared with the conventional approach. The EVSI behaved as 
expected: it increased and converged to EVPPI for larger sample sizes. For each 
case study, generating the PSA results for the GAM approach required 3 to 4 days 
on a shared cluster, after which EVPPI and EVSI across a range of sample sizes 
were evaluated in minutes. The conventional approach required approximately 5 
weeks for the EVPPI calculation alone.
CONCLUSION: Estimating EVSI using the GAM approach with results from a PSA 
dramatically reduced the time required to conduct a computationally intense 
project, which would otherwise have been impractical. Using the GAM approach, we 
can efficiently provide policy makers with EVSI estimates, even for complex 
patient-level microsimulation models.

Identification of risk factors unique to the aging experience is vital to 
support health promotion efforts and prevent loss of independence for the 
increasing aging population. Health risk appraisals are tools capable of 
identifying a broad range of factors that affect health; however, these tools 
were designed for use with predominantly healthy working-age adults. The purpose 
of this integrative review was to describe uses and adaptations of health risk 
appraisals with aging adults. A total of 43 articles met inclusion criteria, 
identifying multiple adaptations necessary to effectively identify the risks 
faced by aging adults, including those related to activities of daily living, 
pain, depression, social support/network, vision, hearing, and cognitive status. 
Uses included support for health promotion efforts and to determine risk for 
depression, falls, and loss of independence. Further research needs to be done 
to evaluate impact when used as a health promotion and prevention tool for aging 
adults.

immunotherapy.

In recent years, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) able to reinvigorate antitumor 
T-cell immunity have heralded a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. The most 
high profile of these mAbs block the inhibitory checkpoint receptors PD-1 and 
CTLA-4 and have improved life expectancy for patients across a range of tumor 
types. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that failure of some patients 
to respond to checkpoint inhibition is attributable to inadequate T-cell 
priming. For full T-cell activation, 2 signals must be received, and ligands 
providing the second of these signals, termed costimulation, are often lacking 
in tumors. Members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) are key 
costimulators of T cells during infection, and there has been an increasing 
interest in harnessing these receptors to augment tumor immunity. We here review 
the immunobiology of 2 particularly promising TNFRSF target receptors, CD27 and 
OX40, and their respective ligands, CD70 and OX40L, focusing on their role 
within a tumor setting. We describe the influence of CD27 and OX40 on human T 
cells based on in vitro studies and on the phenotypes of several recently 
described individuals exhibiting natural deficiencies in CD27/CD70 and OX40. 
Finally, we review key literature describing progress in elucidating the 
efficacy and mode of action of OX40- and CD27-targeting mAbs in preclinical 
models and provide an overview of current clinical trials targeting these 
promising receptor/ligand pairings in cancer.

Adult gliomas are aggressive brain tumours associated with low patient survival 
rates and limited life expectancy. The most important hallmark of this type of 
tumour is its invasive behaviour, characterized by a markedly phenotypic 
plasticity, infiltrative tumour morphologies and the ability of malignant 
progression from low- to high-grade tumour types. Indeed, the widespread 
infiltration of healthy brain tissue by glioma cells is largely responsible for 
poor prognosis and the difficulty of finding curative therapies. Meanwhile, 
mathematical models have been established to analyse potential mechanisms of 
glioma invasion. In this review, we start with a brief introduction to current 
biological knowledge about glioma invasion, and then critically review and 
highlight future challenges for mathematical models of glioma invasion.

Objectives　To investigate the relationship between frailty, metabolic syndrome 
(MetS), and loss of independence leading to the onset of disability or death 
among community-dwelling older Japanese.Methods　Between 2002 and 2011, we 
conducted a 7-year prospective study involving 1,453 residents aged 65 years and 
over, initially free of disability, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment in Kusatsu town. Statistical analysis was conducted for those with 
complete values, resulting in a variable number of subjects for each data point. 
Frailty was defined for 1,335 subjects as three or more of the following 
criteria: weight loss (>2-3 kg in the past six months), weakness (grip strength 
was <26 kg for men and <18 kg for women), exhaustion (answer of "no" to the 
question "Do you feel full of energy?" on the Geriatric Depression Scale), 
slowness (usual gait speed<1.0 m/s), and low physical activity (answer of "less 
than once a week" to the question "How often do you usually go outdoors?"). MetS 
was defined for 1,450 subjects from the Japanese definition. The Cox 
proportional-hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) of 
loss of independence for 1,217 subjects.Results　During the follow-up, 494 cases 
of loss of independence, including 376 disabilities and 118 deaths were 
identified. In men and women, the incidence of the loss of independence showed a 
significant linear trend according to the severity classification of frailty. By 
contrast, there was no relationship between MetS and the loss of independence. 
Subjects classified as prefrail and frail had an increased risk of loss of 
independence compared with robust participants, with sex- and age-adjusted HRs 
(95% CIs) of 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.4 (1.8-3.3), respectively. After adjusting for 
sex, age, the presence of MetS, low serum total cholesterol, chronic kidney 
disease, anemia, low serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and past history of 
stroke, the respective multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of loss of independence were 
1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.1 (1.5-2.9). The magnitude of the risk of loss of 
independence incidence for frailty was greater among the subjects aged 65-74 
years than those aged ≥75 years.Conclusions　Frailty was significantly associated 
with incident loss of independence among elderly Japanese. The presence of MetS 
had no effect on subsequent onset of disability and mortality in elderly 
Japanese. Our findings suggest screening and intervention for frailty in the 
early stage of aging are beneficial to prolong healthy life expectancy of 
elderly Japanese.

Aim: Previous research into the etiology of neuromuscular fatigue following 
competitive soccer match-play has primarily focused on peripheral perturbations, 
with limited research assessing central nervous system function in the days 
post-match. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution and 
time-course of recovery of central and peripheral factors toward neuromuscular 
fatigue following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Sixteen male 
semi-professional soccer players completed a 90-min soccer match. Pre-, post- 
and at 24, 48, and 72 h participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, 
physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and 
twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during isometric knee-extension and at 
rest were measured to assess central nervous system (voluntary activation, VA) 
and muscle contractile (potentiated twitch force, Qtw, pot) function. 
Electromyography responses of the rectus femoris to single- and paired-pulse TMS 
were used to assess corticospinal excitability and short-interval intracortical 
inhibition (SICI), respectively. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were 
assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through 
measures of jump (countermovement jump height and reactive strength index) and 
sprint performance. Results: Competitive match-play elicited significant 
post-match declines in MVC force (-14%, P < 0.001) that persisted for 48 h (-4%, 
P = 0.01), before recovering by 72 h post-exercise. VA (motor point stimulation) 
was reduced immediately post-match (-8%, P < 0.001), and remained depressed at 
24 h (-5%, P = 0.01) before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. Qtw,pot was 
reduced post-match (-14%, P < 0.001), remained depressed at 24 h (-6%, P = 
0.01), before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. No changes were evident in 
corticospinal excitability or SICI. Jump performance took 48 h to recover, while 
perceptions of fatigue persisted at 72 h. Conclusion: Competitive soccer 
match-play elicits substantial impairments in central nervous system and muscle 
function, requiring up to 48 h to resolve. The results of the study could have 
important implications for fixture scheduling, the optimal management of the 
training process, squad rotation during congested competitive schedules, and the 
implementation of appropriate recovery interventions.

PURPOSE: To assess the variability of radiation dose exposure in patients 
affected by lymphoma undergoing repeat CT (computed tomography) examinations and 
to evaluate the influence of different scan parameters on the overall radiation 
dose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 34 patients (12 men and 22 women with a 
median age of 34.4 years) with lymphoma, after the initial staging CT underwent 
repeat follow-up CT examinations. For each patient and each repeat examination, 
age, sex, use of AEC system (Automated Exposure Control, i.e. current 
modulation), scan length, kV value, number of acquired scans (i.e. number of 
phases), abdominal size diameter and dose length product (DLP) were recorded. 
The radiation dose of just one venous phase was singled out from the DLP of the 
entire examination. All scan data were retrieved by our PACS (Picture Archiving 
and Communication System) by means of a dose monitoring software.
RESULTS: Among the variables we considered, no significant difference of 
radiation dose was observed among patients of different ages nor concerning tube 
voltage. On the contrary the dose delivered to the patients varied depending on 
sex, scan length and usage of AEC. No significant difference was observed 
depending on the behaviour of technologists, while radiologists' choices had 
indirectly an impact on the radiation dose due to the different number of scans 
requested by each of them.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that patients affected by lymphoma who 
undergo repeat whole body CT scanning may receive unnecessary overexposure. We 
quantified and analyzed the most relevant variables in order to provide a useful 
tool to manage properly CT dose variability, estimating the amount of additional 
radiation dose for every single significant variable. Additional scans, 
incorrect scan length and incorrect usage of AEC system are the most relevant 
cause of patient radiation exposure.

The treatment of intertrochanteric fractures comparison of PFN and 
hemiarthroplasty 3-year mortality study.

Gölge UH, Pazarci O, Kılınç S, Nusran G, Kaymaz B, Göksel F, Kömürcü E, Bulut O.

Intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients can increase mortality due to 
complications and negative functional results. The aim of this study is to 
retrospectively compare the follow-up and mortality rates among patients given a 
proximal femoral nail (PFN), the current routine treatment for these types of 
fractures, with those given hemiarthroplasty.The study retrospectively 
investigated 202 patients over the age of 60 who completed at least 3 years of 
follow-up after hemiarthroplasty or PFN for intertrochanteric fractures between 
2007 and 2012. While 132 patients underwent cemented hemiarthroplasty, 70 had 
PFN.The monitoring duration for those with PFN surgery was 31.25±1.3 months 
while the duration of follow-up for those with hemiarthroplasty surgery was 
20.0±1.2 months. At the end of 3 years of monitoring of the 202 patients, 99 
were deceased. There was a statistically significant difference found in terms 
of patient life expectancy between those with PFN and those with 
hemiarthroplasty; Cox regression analysis identified that the mortality rate of 
those with hemiarthroplasty was 5.1 times greater.As a result, patients 
undergoing hemiarthroplasty should be carefully chosen and if possible, PFN 
should be preferred.
