This paper studies life-cycle preferences over consumption and health status. We 
show that cost-effectiveness analysis is consistent with cost-benefit analysis 
if the lifetime utility function is additive over time, multiplicative in the 
utility of consumption and the utility of health status, and if the utility of 
consumption is constant over time. We derive the conditions under which the 
lifetime utility function takes this form, both under expected utility theory 
and under rank-dependent utility theory, which is currently the most important 
nonexpected utility theory. If cost-effectiveness analysis is consistent with 
cost-benefit analysis, it is possible to derive tractable expressions for the 
willingness to pay for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The willingness to 
pay for QALYs depends on wealth, remaining life expectancy, health status, and 
the possibilities for intertemporal substitution of consumption.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the mean time to cancer-specific death in patients with 
prostate cancer, using a minimum follow-up of 14 years at one institution, and 
thus evaluate the minimum life-expectancy for eligibility for radical surgery, 
radiotherapy and, implicitly, prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The tumour registry of the authors' institution was 
searched for the records of patients with prostate cancer (stages T1 and 
nonmetastatic T2-3) over the period 1976-1983, chosen to give a maximum 
follow-up with sufficient numbers of patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and the mean 
time to death to 1995 for palpable and impalpable cancers were calculated. 
Deaths not from cancer and from unknown causes were censored. Patients still 
alive were also censored, except for in the calculation of mean time to death.
RESULTS: Patients with both stages of disease had a steep increase in mortality 
at 16 years. The mean (SEM) time to prostate cancer-specific death for T1 
disease was 17 (1.8) years and for T2-T3 (palpable) was 11.7 (1.2 years).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, if there is to be one at all, the upper 
age limit for prostate cancer screening should be 62 years.

It is a common knowledge that the population around the world is growing old at 
an unprecedented rate. This is the success story of increasing life expectancy. 
The demographic breakthroughs occurred in the 20th century. The quality of life 
breakthrough is our challenge for the 21st century. The implications of the 
growing elderly population are many, including: rising total health care 
expenditures; the increasing needs for long-term care services; and the need for 
expert and focused health care services. Since health care costs increase with 
advancing age of populations, these costs will fall on older persons, families, 
and society generally. There is real value for everyone in meeting the needs of 
an aging society, especially if seen as part of a social contract. The ability 
to live independently improves with access to good care, but decreases 
dramatically for those with age-related disabling conditions. With the 
decreasing number of informal caregivers around the world, frail elderly will 
require more formal long-term care services. However, due to inadequate 
attention given to long-term care issues, numerous developed countries have 
recently started to struggle to develop long-term care service programs that 
will both meet the rising needs for this service and be cost-effective. 
Effective medical care requires expertise in functional assessment, 
interdisciplinary care, and advances in treating symptoms of aging. The field of 
geriatrics is essential to modern health care, and geriatricians need to have 
proper training that focuses diagnosing and treating this group of patients. 
Quality care will not only help the elderly to live productively and 
independently, but it will also tremendously benefit families and communities.

Countries in both the developed and developing world are expected to experience 
an unprecedented growth in the number of their elderly and decline in the number 
of their youth. This extraordinarily rapid aging of the world's population is a 
phenomenon without precedence in human history. Additionally, there is an 
increasing gap between the rich and poor both among and within nations. Both 
trends will not only constitute the primary health issues of the first decades 
of the 21st century but will also profoundly alter the world's economic, 
political, and social landscapes.

Review of centralized packaging systems for distribution of retail-ready meat.

Jeyamkondan S(1), Jayas DS, Holley RA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, 
Canada.

There is growing interest in centralized preparation of retail-ready meat cuts 
for distribution to widely dispersed retail stores due to the convenience of 
having high-quality ready-to-go products that are consistently provided to 
consumers at lower cost. Various centralized packaging techniques are described. 
Of all packaging techniques, master packaging is the most economical and shows 
promise for commercial application. Nevertheless, the master-packaging technique 
must be integrated with strict temperature control in a narrow range just above 
freezing (- 1.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C), good processing hygiene, and maintenance of 
a completely anoxic atmosphere in the package headspace throughout the 
distribution period to maximize storage life. Packaging using the CAPTECH 
process reduces the residual O2 present in the headspace to 300 ppm. Oxygen 
scavengers must be incorporated in the package to absorb the residual O2 and 
preserve the metmyoglobin reducing activity of meat tissues. Integration of all 
these technologies can provide a storage life of retail-ready meat up to 10 
weeks in the master package followed by 3 days of retail display life. This 
extension of storage life is sufficient for transporting meat to distant 
markets.

Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) represents a common neurodegenerative 
disorder. An estimated 2% of the U.S. population, age 65 and older, develops 
IPD. The number of IPD patients will certainly increase over the next several 
decades as the baby-boomers gradually step into this high-risk age group, 
concomitant with the increase in the average life expectancy. While many studies 
have suggested that industrial chemicals and pesticides may underlie IPD, its 
etiology remains elusive. Among the toxic metals, the relationship between 
manganese intoxication and IPD has long been recognized. The neurological signs 
of manganism have received close attention because they resemble several 
clinical disorders collectively described as extrapyramidal motor system 
dysfunction, and in particular, IPD and dystonia. However, distinct 
dissimilarities between IPD and manganism are well established, and it remains 
to be determined whether Mn plays an etiologic role in IPD. It is particularly 
noteworthy that as a result of a recent court decision, methylcyclopentadienyl 
Mn tricarbonyl (MMT) is presently available in the United States and Canada for 
use in fuel, replacing lead as an antiknock additive. The impact of potential 
long-term exposure to low levels of MMT combustion products that may be present 
in emissions from automobiles has yet to be fully evaluated. Nevertheless, it 
should be pointed out that recent studies with various environmental modeling 
approaches in the Montreal metropolitan (where MMT has been used for more than 
10 years) suggest that airborne Mn levels were quite similar to those in areas 
where MMT was not used. These studies also show that Mn is emitted from the tail 
pipe of motor vehicles primarily as a mixture of manganese phosphate and 
manganese sulfate. This brief review characterizes the Mn speciation in the 
blood and the transport kinetics of Mn into the central nervous system, a 
critical step in the accumulation of Mn within the brain, outlines the potential 
susceptibility of selected populations (e.g., iron-deficient) to Mn exposure, 
and addresses future research needs for Mn.

Study on measuring burden of disease.

Pang L(1), Jin SG, Song GD, Guo ZY.

DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) was recommended as a new indicator to 
measure burden of disease (BOD). Although BOD combines information from both 
morbidity and mortality, it only reflects the burden from the patients 
themselves because of their illness or death. As a common indicator, BOD should 
not only include the burden from the patients, but also the burden to the 
society around the patients, such as the input and support from the society to 
the ill person, and the losses from the related events. The aim of this study is 
to explore the scope and the magnitude of the burden to the society using stroke 
as an example. Results show that the burden due to time lost for caring for 
patients in hospitals accounts for 2.4% of total BOD (in a narrow sense), which 
indicates that BOD may be underestimated if the burden to the society is 
ignored.

AL 35294-0022, USA.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy for black Americans is five to eight years less than 
for Whites. The socioeconomic status (SES) of Blacks is also less than for 
Whites, and SES is associated with early mortality. This paper estimates the 
proportion of the racial difference in mortality attributable to SES by specific 
causes of death.
METHODS: Data on 453,384 individuals in the National Longitudinal Mortality 
Study were used to estimate the hazard ratio associated with black race, with 
and without adjustment for income and education (measures of SES), in 38 strata 
defined by cause of death and age.
RESULTS: For women, SES accounted for much (37-67%) of the black excess 
mortality for accidents, ischemic heart disease (ages 35-54), diabetes, and 
homicide; but not for hypertension, infections, and stomach cancers (11-17%). 
For men, SES accounted for much of the excess risk (30-55%) for accidents, lung 
cancer, stomach cancer, stroke, and homicide; but not for prostate cancer, 
pulmonary diseases, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy (0-17%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm those specific causes of death likely to 
underlie the overall excess mortality of Blacks, and identify those causes where 
SES may play a large role.

AIM: The specific goal of the study was to evaluate the availability of the 
histologic grading of cancer and its effect on survival in an Italian 
population-based cancer series.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the Tuscany Cancer Registry, active in central 
Italy since 1985. Among the cases incident during the period 1985 to 1989, 
bladder, prostate, colon, corpus uteri, rectum and stomach cancers, for which 
the proportion of graded cases exceeded 50%, were analyzed. Overall, 5,923 
cancer cases were included. Ten-year relative survival rates by grade were 
computed.
RESULTS: Overall, data on histologic grading was available only for 38% of 
cases. The sites most frequently graded were urinary bladder (80%), prostate 
(73%), colon (71%), corpus uteri (69%), rectum (65%) and stomach (56%). For all 
the cancer sites analyzed, the 10-year relative survival rates increased as the 
histologic grading improved. The grade distribution resulted related also to the 
disease extension, more limited the extension higher the proportion of well 
differentiated cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the evidenced importance of histologic grading as a valuable 
prognostic factor, it should be requested by clinicians and reported by 
pathologists more frequently than has been done in the area.

Valgus extension osteotomy for 'hinge abduction' in Perthes' disease. Results at 
maturity and factors influencing the radiological outcome.

UK.

Valgus extension osteotomy (VGEO) is a salvage procedure for 'hinge abduction' 
in Perthes' disease. The indications for its use are pain and fixed deformity. 
Our study shows the clinical results at maturity of VGEO carried out in 48 
children (51 hips) and the factors which influence subsequent remodelling of the 
hip. After a mean follow-up of ten years, total hip replacement has been carried 
out in four patients and arthrodesis in one. The average Iowa Hip Score in the 
remainder was 86 (54 to 100). Favourable remodelling of the femoral head was 
seen in 12 hips. This was associated with three factors at surgery; younger age 
(p = 0.009), the phase of reossification (p = 0.05) and an open triradiate 
cartilage (p = 0.0007). Our study has shown that, in the short term, VGEO 
relieves pain and corrects deformity; as growth proceeds it may produce useful 
remodelling in this worst affected subgroup of children with Perthes' disease.

PURPOSE: Homosexual and bisexual men are at an increased risk for human 
papillomavirus-induced squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer of the anus. 
Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for anal 
squamous intraepithelial lesions in these high-risk patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate alternative 
screening strategies using anal cytology in a hypothetical cohort of homosexual 
and bisexual men. Data were obtained from prospective cohort studies, national 
databases, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the published literature. Model 
outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, total 
lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: The undiscounted life expectancy gain associated with anal cytology 
screening every 3 years was 5.5 months. Compared with no screening, screening 
every 3 years increased the discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.8 
months and cost $7,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Screening 
every 2 years cost $15,100 per QALY gained compared with screening every 3 
years. Annual screening provided incremental benefits of less than 0.5 
quality-adjusted months and had an incremental cost of $34,800 per QALY gained. 
Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit (i.e, 5 days) over 
that of annual screening and had an incremental cost of $143,500 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: In homosexual and bisexual men, screening every 2 or 3 years for 
anal squamous intraepithelial lesions with anal cytology would provide 
life-expectancy benefits comparable with other accepted preventive health 
measures, and would be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Coverage of sildenafil by health insurance plans is a contentious 
issue.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sildenafil treatment for 
erectile dysfunction.
DESIGN: A Markov decision model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness 
of sildenafil compared with no drug therapy.
DATA SOURCES: Values for the efficacy and safety of sildenafil and 
quality-of-life utilities were obtained from the published medical literature. 
Base-case values were chosen to bias against sildenafil use.
TARGET POPULATION: Men 60 years of age with erectile dysfunction.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and third-party payer.
INTERVENTION: Sildenafil or no treatment in identical hypothetical cohorts.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost per QALY gained for sildenafil treatment 
compared with no therapy was $11,290 from the societal perspective and $11,230 
from the third-party payer perspective.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: From the societal perspective, the cost per 
QALY gained associated with sildenafil was less than $50,000 if 
treatment-related morbidity was less than 0.8% per year, mortality was less than 
0.55% per year, treatment was successful in more than 40.2% of patients, or 
sildenafil cost less than $244 per month. The results were sensitive to 
variation of erectile dysfunction utilities, but cost per QALY gained was less 
than $50,000 if successful treatment increased utility values by 0.05 or more on 
a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis biased against use of sildenafil, the 
cost-effectiveness of sildenafil treatment compared favorably with that of 
accepted therapies for other medical conditions.

PURPOSE: Cost-utility analysis is a type of cost-effectiveness analysis in which 
health effects are measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
gained. Such analyses have become popular for examining the health and economic 
consequences of health and medical interventions, and they have been recommended 
by leaders in the field. These recommendations emphasize the importance of good 
reporting practices. This study determined 1) the quality of reporting in 
published cost-utility analyses through 1997 and 2) whether reporting practices 
have improved over time. We examined quality of reporting by journal type and 
number of cost-utility analyses a journal has published.
DATA SOURCES: Computerized databases were searched through 1997 for the Medical 
Subject Headings or text keywords quality-adjusted, QALY, and cost-utility 
analysis. Published bibliographies of the field were also searched.
STUDY SELECTION: Original cost-utility analyses written in English were 
included. Cost-effectiveness analyses that measured health effects in units 
other than QALYs and review, editorial, or methodologic articles were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Each of the 228 articles found was audited independently by two 
trained readers who used a standard data collection form to determine the 
quality of reporting in several categories: disclosure of funding, framing, 
reporting of costs, reporting of preference weights, reporting of results, and 
discussion.
RESULTS: The number of cost-utility analyses in the medical literature increased 
greatly between 1976 and 1997. Analyses covered a wide range of diseases and 
interventions. Most studies listed modeling assumptions (82%), described the 
comparator intervention (83%), reported sensitivity analysis (89%), and noted 
study limitations (84%). Only 52% clearly stated the study perspective; 34% did 
not disclose the funding source. Methods of reporting costs and preference 
weights varied widely. The quality of published analyses improved slightly over 
time and was higher in general clinical journals and in journals that published 
more of these analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results reveal an active and evolving field but also 
underscore the need for more consistency and clarity in reporting. Better peer 
review and independent, third-party audits may help in this regard. Future 
investigations should examine the quality of clinical and economic assumptions 
used in cost-utility analyses, in addition to whether analysts followed 
recommended protocols for performance and reporting.

Assessing the burden of sexual and reproductive ill-health: questions regarding 
the use of disability-adjusted life years.

AbouZahr C(1), Vaughan JP.

Author information:
(1)Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization, 
Geneva, Switzerland. abouzahrc@who.int

The use of the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as the unit in which to 
calculate the burden of disease associated with reproductive ill-health has 
given rise to considerable debate. Criticisms include the failure to address the 
problem of missing and inadequate epidemiological data, inability to deal 
adequately with co-morbidities, and lack of transparency in the process of 
ascribing disability weights to sexual and reproductive health conditions. Many 
of these criticisms could be addressed within the current DALY framework and a 
number of suggestions to do so are made. These suggestions include: (1) 
developing an international research strategy to determine the incidence and 
prevalence of reproductive ill-health and diseases, including the risk of 
long-term complications; (2) undertaking a research strategy using case studies, 
population-based surveillance data and longitudinal studies to identify, 
evaluate and utilize more of the existing national data sources on sexual and 
reproductive health; (3) comprehensively mapping the natural history of sexual 
and reproductive health conditions--in males and in females--and their sequelae, 
whether physical or psychological; (4) developing valuation instruments that are 
adaptable for both chronic and acute health states, that reflect a range of 
severity for each health state and can be modified to reflect prognosis; (5) 
undertaking a full review of the DALY methodology to determine what changes may 
be made to reduce sources of methodological and gender bias. Despite the many 
criticisms of the DALY as a measurement unit, it represents a major conceptual 
advance since it permits the combination of life expectancy and levels of 
dysfunction into a single measure. Measuring reproductive ill-health by counting 
deaths alone is inadequate for a proper understanding of the dimensions of the 
problem because of the young age of many of the deaths associated with 
reproductive ill-health and the large component of years lived with disability 
from many of the associated conditions.

BACKGROUND: Although exercise training improves cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk factors, few studies have evaluated its potential long-term 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Using the Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model, a validated 
disease simulation model, we calculated the life expectancy of average 35- to 
74-year-old Canadians found in the 1992 Canadian Heart Health Survey. The 
impacts of exercise training on cardiovascular risk factors were estimated as a 
4% decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a 5% increase in 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and a 6 mm Hg decrease in both 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Exercise adherence was estimated at 50% 
for the first year and 30% for all additional years. Costs for a supervised 
exercise program determined from Canadian sources and converted to US dollars 
were estimated at $605 for the first year (medical evaluation, stress test, 
exercise prescription, and program costs) and $367 for all additional years 
(program costs). For an unsupervised program, the costs were estimated at $311 
for the first year and $73 for all additional years.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness (CE) of an unsupervised exercise program (1996 
U.S. dollars) was less than $12,000 per year of life saved (YOLS) for all 
individuals. The CE of a supervised exercise program was less than $15,000/YOLS 
for men with CVD, and between $12,000 and $43,000 for women with CVD and men 
without CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively few risks, substantial long-term benefits, and 
modest costs, an unsupervised exercise training program represents good value 
for all. A more expensive supervised exercise program is also cost-effective for 
most individuals with CVD.

Ethics consultation on demand: concepts, practical experiences and a case study.

Despite the increasing interest in clinical ethics, ethics consultation as a 
professional service is still rare in Europe. In this paper I refer to examples 
in the United States. In Germany, university hospitals and medical faculties are 
still hesitant about establishing yet another "committee". One of the reasons 
for this hesitation lies in the ignorance that exists here about how to provide 
medical ethics services; another reason is that medical ethics itself is not yet 
institutionalised at many German universities. The most important obstacle, 
however, may be that medical ethics has not yet demonstrated its relevance to 
the needs of those caring for patients. The Centre for Ethics and Law, Freiburg, 
has therefore taken a different approach from that offered elsewhere: clinical 
ethics consultation is offered on demand, the consultation being available to 
clinician(s) in different forms. This paper describes our experiences with this 
approach; practical issues are illustrated by a case study.

Liver disease-significant improvement with lamivudine.

Hong Kong.

The natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly 
variable, ranging from a benign course to one of shortened life expectancy. 
Liver histology represents an accurate tool for assessing progressive liver 
disease, and has been used in five recent Phase III clinical trials of the oral 
nucleoside analogue, lamivudine, 100 mg/day, in patients with chronic hepatitis 
B. Significant improvements in the Knodell histological activity index (HAI) 
score were reported with lamivudine, with greater decreases noted after 2 years 
of therapy, consistent with continued alanine transaminase (ALT) normalisation. 
Histological data showed that lamivudine therapy can resolve or lessen the 
progression of fibrosis, and reduce the progression to cirrhosis in patients 
with chronic hepatitis B. These trials also showed that lamivudine provoked 
significant enhancement of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion compared 
with placebo, and had a profound effect on serum HBV DNA, resulting in rapid 
suppression of viraemia. The emergence of variants with a mutation in the YMDD 
(tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-as-partate) motif did not cause significant 
worsening of the Knodell HAI score. In conclusion, lamivudine is the first oral 
antiviral therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. It reduces 
significantly the severity of liver disease and reduces progression to 
cirrhosis. In addition, because lamivudine is well tolerated it represents a 
viable therapeutic option that may improve the prognosis of patients with 
chronic hepatitis B.

Life expectancy, antagonistic pleiotropy, and the testis of dogs and men.

Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA. waters@vet.purdue.edu

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are important 
age-related prostatic diseases that are under the influence of testicular 
hormones. However, the disparity between male and female life expectancy within 
the human population cannot be explained solely by the prevalence of prostatic 
disease-related mortality. The purpose of this paper is to explore the 
possibility that the testis exerts a detrimental effect on life span.
METHODS: First, we review previously published and unpublished data on the 
influence of the testis on the life span of dogs and men. Aging in pet dogs and 
men is then discussed in terms of evolutionary theory, emphasizing the 
significance of a prolonged postreproductive life span and possible consequences 
of late-acting deleterious genes in these two species. Finally, we present 
preliminary data that orchiectomy can reduce DNA damage within the brain of 
elderly male dogs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these observations 
raise the intriguing possibility that interventions to antagonize the testis 
might have much broader therapeutic applications that will extend well beyond 
the treatment of prostate cancer.

Loss of heterozygosity in spontaneous and X-ray-induced intestinal tumors 
arising in F1 hybrid min mice: evidence for sequential loss of APC(+) and Dpc4 
in tumor development.

Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice carry a mutant allele of the murine Apc 
(adenomatous polyposis coli) locus and are predisposed to intestinal adenoma 
formation in the intestinal tract. Early studies have shown complete loss of 
function of Apc by whole chromosome loss on the tumor-sensitive C57BL/6J genetic 
background and in AKR x B6 F1 hybrids. Gamma-radiation-induced chromosomal 
losses focus the critical region on wt Apc, but because of the limited number of 
polymorphic markers used, no other critical regions of loss on chromosome 18 
were identified. Using intestinal tumors arising spontaneously and induced by 
X-rays in CBA/H x C57BL/6J F1 hybrid mice and high-resolution microsatellite 
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) techniques, we provide mapping data for wt Apc 
loss, which confirms and extends earlier observations. In addition, 
high-frequency loss events at the Dpc4 locus were found in both spontaneous and 
radiation-induced tumors. These data identified LOH of Dpc4 as a critical 
secondary event following complete functional loss of Apc. LOH across the Trp53 
genomic region of chromosome 11 was not observed. No LOH was recorded for the 
Mom1 candidate gene Pla2g2a or for 9 out of 10 polymorphic markers from the Mom1 
genomic region on murine chromosome 4. One marker mapping distal to Pla2g2a 
showed LOH in a small minority of spontaneous tumors. These data support the 
contention that Mom1 does not act as a classical tumor suppressor. Overall, our 
data indicates a significant role for Dpc4 mutation in intestinal tumor 
progression in the mouse and provides further evidence for the importance of 
interstitial chromosome losses in radiation tumorigenesis.

Discrete time representation of the formula for calculating DALYs.

Elbasha EH(1).

Author information:
(1)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta 30341, USA. ebe4@cdc.gov

The global burden of disease (GBD) was measured using a new indicator called 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The formula to calculate DALYs is based 
on the idea of time being a continuous variable, which is not consistent with 
the way economic and health data are collected and reported, and is also 
different from the concept of time used in the vast majority of policy analyses. 
Use of this formula gives rise to a time-aggregation bias in the estimates of 
GBD. Based on discrete time representation and the key principles outlined in 
the GBD study, a new formula for estimating DALYs is derived in this paper. The 
properties of the two formulae are compared and contrasted and the implications 
of using the new formula are discussed. The results show that there is an 
appreciable difference in percentage terms (14.06%) between the burden of 
cataract in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1990 calculated using the new and the old 
formulae. The global burden of diseases and injuries as previously reported in 
the GDB study may, therefore, be underestimated and the relative positions of 
some diseases and injuries, and hence the relative priorities of related 
interventions, may shift if the more appropriate, discrete-time formula is used. 
The difference is greatest for diseases of short duration (e.g. infectious 
diseases).

Excerpts from Joseph Stiglitz's speech to the World Bank, April 1999.

Scher A, Baxandall P.

The Journal has published several articles critical of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund. These articles have shown the damage caused by the 
neoliberal policies advocated by these agencies to the health and quality of 
life of the people in countries where such policies are carried out. Published 
here are excerpts of a speech given by Joseph Stiglitz, senior economist of the 
World Bank, in which he finally recognizes the damage these policies have caused 
in Russia, where life expectancy has fallen quite dramatically during the years 
of neoliberal reform. The question triggered by his speech is why the World Bank 
continues its neoliberal policies.

[Chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients. Unfavorable interaction of HIV 
and HCV infection].

[Article in German]

Mauss S.

HIV coinfection promotes the progression of chronic hepatitis C. The increased 
hepatic mortality and improved life expectancy of HIV-positive patients warrants 
treatment of chronic hepatitis C in those infected with HIV. The treatment of 
hepatitis C considered standard for HIV-negative and, in principle, also for 
HIV-positive patients is the combination of interferon alpha with ribavirin. 
Possible interaction with the antiretroviral treatment by ribavirin must, 
however, taken into account. Although new therapeutic approaches are available, 
they have not yet been adequately validated terms of their efficacy and safety.

Both the acute intensive care of premature infants and the management of their 
long-term medical and educational sequelae are costly. Because neonatal 
intensive care is very effective in reducing mortality, however, its cost 
effectiveness as described previously is actually quite favorable when compared 
with other well-accepted medical interventions, such as coronary artery bypass 
grafting and renal dialysis. This article has highlighted the relatively scant 
literature on which those estimates of costs and cost effectiveness of both 
neonatal intensive care and its component interventions rest. This is 
particularly true with respect to long-term resource use by graduates of NICUs. 
Without such information, we cannot hope to allocate resources in a way that 
ensures optimal care of this vulnerable population.

PURPOSE: To prospectively analyze the outcome of patients with Stage A 
neuroblastoma (NB) treated with surgery alone, especially with regard to the 
prognostic significance of age, tumor site, MYCN copy number, tumor cell ploidy, 
and histology.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical course of 329 patients with Stage A disease 
registered on the POG NB Biology Study #9047 between February, 1990 and October, 
1997 were evaluated. Age, tumor site, MYCN copy number, tumor cell ploidy, and 
histology were analyzed for their impact on event-free survival (EFS) and 
survival (S).
RESULTS: The 5-year estimated EFS and S rates for the 329 patients were 91% 
(+/-3%) and 96% (+/-2%), respectively. The EFS rate was similar for infants 
younger than 12 months and children age 12 months or older, but age older than 
12 months was predictive of lower S rates (P = 0.044). Patients with adrenal, 
abdominal non-adrenal, thoracic, and cervical tumors had similar S rates. The 
majority of patients had tumors with favorable biologic features, and only 3% 
had MYCN amplification. For infants with diploid tumors, the EFS rate was 82% 
(+/-16%), but effective therapy yielded an S rate of 100%. Rate of S was 80% 
(+/-26%) and 64% (+/-27%) for patients with unfavorable tumor histology and 
MYCN-amplified tumors, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The outcome for patients with Stage A NB treated with surgery alone 
is excellent. Although EFS and S rates were significantly worse for patients 
with MYCN-amplified tumors, a subset achieved long-term remission after surgery 
alone. For patients with Stage A and MYCN amplification, additional factors are 
needed to distinguish the patients who will achieve long-term remission with 
surgery alone from those who will develop recurrent disease.

PURPOSE: The authors conducted a single-arm, prospective study using tamoxifen 
and carboplatin for the treatment of children with progressive or symptomatic 
low-grade gliomas.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen children with consecutively diagnosed cases of 
low-grade glioma were enrolled in this Study; all patients were younger than 14 
years. One patient was excluded after induction chemotherapy because of the 
diagnosis of a nonmalignant condition. Patients were treated with daily 
tamoxifen (20 mg/m2 administered twice per day) in addition to targeted, monthly 
intravenous carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) exposure of 6.5 mg/mL x 
minute for 1 year or until they had clinical or radiologic evidence of disease 
progression.
RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 5.3 years, the median age at initiation 
of chemotherapy was 8.3 years. Eight patients had tumors of the 
hypothalamus/optic pathway, two patients had thalamic tumors, and one patient 
each had tumors in the temporal lobe, tectum, and brain stem. Tumor histologic 
findings included fibrillary astrocytoma (n = 2), juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma 
(n = 6), and oligodendroglioma (n = 1). The best response to therapy was a 
partial response in two patients, stable disease in nine patients, and 
progressive disease in two patients. The overall survival at 3 years is 69%. The 
3-year progression-free survival is 47%. Tamoxifen and carboplatin chemotherapy 
did not result in a significant number of objective responses in children with 
low-grade gliomas. The progression-free survival is similar to that of other 
published series. Nonmyelosuppressive agents such as tamoxifen deserve 
additional evaluation in the treatment of children with low-grade gliomas.
