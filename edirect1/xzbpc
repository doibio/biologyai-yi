The use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for treatment of ocular diseases 
associated with neovascularizations, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 
shows tremendous promise but is presently limited due to short intravitreal 
half-life. Conjugation of ARB molecules to branched polymers could vastly 
augment their therapeutic efficacy. EXP3174, a potent non-peptide ARB, was 
conjugated to branched poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) 
dendrimers: 7.8 ligand molecules were tethered to each 40 kDa PEG molecule 
whereas 16.7 ligand molecules were linked to each PAMAM generation 5 dendrimer. 
The multivalent PEG and PAMAM conjugates blocked AT1R signaling with an IC50 of 
224 and 36.3 nM, respectively. The 6-fold higher affinity of the multivalent 
ligand-conjugated PAMAM dendrimers was due to their unique microarchitecture and 
ability to suppress polymer-drug interactions. Remarkably, both polymer-drug 
conjugates exhibited no cytotoxicity, in stark contrast to plain PAMAM 
dendrimers. With sufficiently long vitreous half-lives, both synthesized 
polymer-ARB conjugates have the potential to pave a new path for the therapy of 
ocular diseases accompanied by retinal neovascularizations.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decisions for elderly 
individuals are often made primarily on the basis of age, whereas other factors 
that influence the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening are often 
not considered. We investigated the relative importance of factors that could be 
used to identify elderly individuals most likely to benefit from CRC screening 
and determined the maximum ages at which screening remains cost effective based 
on these factors.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model (Microsimulation Screening 
Analysis-Colon) calibrated to the incidence of CRC in the United States and the 
prevalence of adenomas reported in autopsy studies to determine the appropriate 
age at which to stop colonoscopy screening in 19,200 cohorts (of 10 million 
individuals), defined by sex, race, screening history, background risk for CRC, 
and comorbidity status. We applied a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Less intensive screening history, higher background risk for CRC, and 
fewer comorbidities were associated with cost-effective screening at older ages. 
Sex and race had only a small effect on the appropriate age to stop screening. 
For some individuals likely to be screened in current practice (for example, 
74-year-old white women with moderate comorbidities, half the average background 
risk for CRC, and negative findings from a screening colonoscopy 10 years 
previously), screening resulted in a loss of QALYs, rather than a gain. For some 
individuals unlikely to be screened in current practice (for example, 
81-year-old black men with no comorbidities, an average background risk for CRC, 
and no previous screening), screening was highly cost effective. Although 
screening some previously screened, low-risk individuals was not cost effective 
even when they were 66 years old, screening some healthy, high-risk individuals 
remained cost effective until they reached the age of 88 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: The current approach to CRC screening in elderly individuals, in 
which decisions are often based primarily on age, is inefficient, resulting in 
underuse of screening for some and overuse of screening for others. CRC 
screening could be more effective and cost effective if individual factors for 
each patient are considered.

In dentistry, clinical radiographs (also called X-ray images) reflect the 
intensity loss of an X-ray when being transmitted through the mandibular 
objects, and this loss is quantified in terms of grey values. While such images 
are standardly used for pathology detection by the experienced dentist, we here 
present a new method for getting more quantitative information out of such 2D 
radiographs, "extending" them into the third dimension. This "extension" 
requires consistent combination of X-ray physics (namely, X-ray intensity loss 
quantification along paths orthogonal to the panoramic clinical image and X-ray 
attenuation averaging for composite materials) with anatomically known upper and 
lower limits of vascular porosities in cortical and trabecular bone 
compartments. Correspondingly computed ranges of overall organ thicknesses are 
extremely narrow, suggesting adequate estimation of thickness characteristics 
from 2D radiographic panoramas used clinically, while predicted cortical and 
trabecular thickness ranges vary by ±8.47% and ±16.13%, respectively. The 
proposed method also identifies variations between thicknesses at similar 
anatomical locations left and right of the face's symmetry axis, and molar 
regions turn out to be thicker than those close to incisors. This paves the way 
to more detailed diagnostic activities, e.g. in combination with Finite Element 
simulations.

The objective of the study is to perform a national survey of practices in 
early-stage squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx (base of tongue and 
tonsils) targeting surgical and non-surgical procedures in France. A 
questionnaire concerning practices in surgery, radiotherapy, HPV screening, and 
two clinical cases were sent to all centers participating in the French Head and 
Neck Oncology Society, and to public hospitals listed as authorized to treat 
head and neck cancer according to the French National Cancer Institute (INCa). 
Sixty-four teams comprising almost all the University Hospitals and most of the 
Comprehensive Cancer Centers completed the survey questionnaire and responded to 
the clinical cases. Surgical and radiotherapy strategies were used in similar 
measure for early-stage SCC of the base of the tongue while tonsil lesions were 
mainly treated with surgery. The main arguments were disease control for the 
teams offering patients surgery, and functional results for those offering 
radiotherapy. However, concomitant chemoradiotherapy was chosen more frequently 
than radiotherapy alone in early-stage SCC of the base of tongue. Age and 
tobacco-alcohol addiction were decisive criteria in decision making for the 
majority of the teams. French oncology teams offered surgical and radiotherapy 
strategies in similar measure to treat early-stage SCC of the oropharynx (base 
of tongue and tonsils) as well as a high rate of multimodality therapy. Decision 
making was guided by the desire to achieve oncologic results adapted to the 
patient and his age, as well as functional preservation taking into account life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with a reduced life expectancy 
compared to the general population mainly due to a high prevalence of comorbid 
somatic illnesses. A model of accelerated aging has been proposed as a potential 
explanation to these epidemiological findings. Nevertheless, studies measuring 
telomere length (TL) in patients with BD compared to healthy controls have 
provided mixed results.
OBJECTIVE: To compare TL between BD patients and healthy controls, and to search 
for potential modeP<rators for observed differences.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of original studies 
comparing TL in patients with BD vs. healthy controls published up to February 
24th, 2015 in main electronic databases. Heterogeneity was explored through 
meta-regression and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria (N=1115). There was no difference 
in TL between participants with BD and healthy controls (Hedges's g=-0.012; 95% 
CI=-0.418 to 0.393, P=0.952). There was no evidence for publication bias. 
Heterogeneity was high (I(2)=89.65%). In meta-regression analyses, the 
percentage of females in healthy control samples (P=0.04) and the methodological 
quality of included studies (P<0.001) emerged as significant moderators, while 
subgroup analyses suggest that the type of assay employed to measure TL and age- 
and gender-matching of BD and HC participants may contribute to heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Telomere length does not differ between participants with BD vs. 
healthy controls; this finding does not support the view of BD as an illness 
associated with accelerated cellular aging. However, more studies controlling 
for potential confounders are necessary.

Ivermectin 1% cream (Soolantra(®); Rosiver™; Izefla(®)) is a novel topical agent 
indicated for the once-daily treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. 
Ivermectin is a derivative of the avermectin family of macrocyclic lactone 
parasiticides. It displays anti-inflammatory properties as well as 
broad-spectrum anti-parasitic activity, both of which may contribute to its 
efficacy in treating rosacea. In phase III trials of 12 or 16 weeks' duration in 
adults with moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea, once-daily ivermectin 1% 
cream improved the symptoms of rosacea (as per Investigator Global Assessment 
and inflammatory lesion count) and health-related quality of life versus 
vehicle, and was more effective than twice-daily metronidazole 0.75% cream in 
terms of these measures. Ivermectin 1% cream continues to provide benefit for up 
to 52 weeks of treatment, according to extension studies, and is well tolerated, 
with the most common treatment-related adverse events (skin burning sensation, 
pruritus, dry skin and skin irritation) each occurring with low incidence (<2%). 
Thus, ivermectin 1% cream is an effective and well tolerated option for the 
topical treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea, with the convenience of 
once-daily application.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: More data are warranted on the economic impact of different 
treatment strategies in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. We compared the costs 
and quality of life of UC patients with a pouch reconstruction, an ileostomy or 
anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy.
METHODS: UC patients filled out 3-monthly questionnaires for 2 years. 
Differences in 3-monthly healthcare costs, productivity costs and patient costs 
were tested using mixed model analysis. Quality of life was assessed employing 
the ) and the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ).
RESULTS: Out of 915 UC patients, 81 (9%) had a pouch and 48 (5%) an ileostomy, 
and 34 (4%) were on anti-TNFα therapy. Anti-TNFα-treated patients reported high 
UC related-healthcare costs per 3 months (€5350). Medication use accounted for 
92% of healthcare costs. UC-attributable healthcare costs were 3-fold higher in 
ileostomy patients compared with pouch patients (€1581 versus €407; p < 0.01). 
Main cost drivers in ileostomy patients were healthcare costs and ileostomy 
supplies (2 and 23% of healthcare costs, respectively). In pouch patients, the 
main cost driver was hospitalization, accounting for 50% of healthcare costs. 
Productivity loss did not differ between pouch and ileostomy patients (€483 
versus €377; p < 0.23), but was significantly higher in anti-TNFα-treated 
patients (€1085). No difference was found in IBDQ scores, but pouch patients 
were found to have higher quality-adjusted life years than ileostomy patients 
and anti-TNFα-treated patients (0.90 [interquartile range 0.78-1.00] versus 0.84 
[0.78-1.00] and 0.84 [0.69-1.00], respectively; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Patients receiving anti-TNFα therapy reported the highest healthcare 
cost, in which medication use was the major cost driver. Ileostomy patients were 
three times more expensive than pouch patients due to frequent hospitalization 
and ileostomy supplies.

Diabetes is burdened by macrovascular and microvascular complications that 
collectively reduce life expectancy. As the ultimate goal of diabetes treatment 
is to prevent excess morbidity and mortality associated with its complications, 
the interest on cardiovascular effects of glucose lowering medications is high. 
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) lower blood glucose by protecting the 
incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from enzymatic degradation, 
thereby restoring meal-stimulated insulin release. DPP-4 has several 
non-incretin substrates, including cytokines, chemokines, and neurohormones, 
which can exert favourable, but also unpredictable, vascular effects, once they 
are stabilized by DPP-4i. Choi et al. now provide additional evidence that 
DPP-4i counteracts vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, 
resulting in an attenuation of neointimal hyperplasia. Though several other in 
vitro, preclinical, and preliminary clinical studies on surrogate end-points 
suggest that DPP-4i can exert similar direct vasculoprotective actions, results 
of placebo-controlled phase IV trials have so far shown no reduction 
cardiovascular endpoints by DPP-4i. In this commentary, we put DPP-4 pleiotropy 
and complexity into context, trying to reconcile why results from basic science 
have not yet translated into clinical evidence of cardiovascular protection.

Center, The Hague, Netherlands (G.d.R., M.P.A.); Department for Health Evidence, 
Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands (T.F.).

BACKGROUND: The treatment of spinal epidural metastasis is multidisciplinary and 
usually involves a team of medical oncologists, radiologists, radiotherapists, 
and spinal surgeons. Life expectancy is one of the factors considered when 
deciding whether surgery is warranted. Because expert estimates of life 
expectancy are generally not reliable, a prediction model is needed. Here, we 
temporally validated a model that was previously validated geographically.
METHODS: The records of 110 consecutive patients who were referred with a spinal 
epidural metastasis were collected prospectively from 2009 to 2013 in order to 
validate the model, which was published in 2011. The actual and estimated life 
expectancies were represented graphically, and calibration and discrimination 
were determined. The calibration slope, Harrell's c-index, D, and R2D were 
calculated. Hazard ratios in the derivation set of 2011 were compared with the 
validation set. Misspecification was determined using the joint test for β*.
RESULTS: The calibration slope was 0.64 ± 0.15 (95% CI: 0.34-0.94), Harrell's 
c-index was 0.72, D was 1.08, and R2D was 0.22, indicating slightly worse 
discrimination in the derivation set. The joint test for β* = 0 was 
statistically significant and indicated misspecification; however, this 
misspecification was attributed entirely to the surgical group.
CONCLUSIONS: We validated a prediction model for surgical decision making, 
showing that the model's overall performance is good. Based on these results, 
this model will help clinicians to decide whether to offer surgery to patients 
with spinal epidural metastasis.

The management of malignant pathological fractures necessitates careful 
diagnostic work-up, pre-operative investigation, planning and multidisciplinary 
input from specialists in the fields of radiology, pathology, oncology, trauma 
and orthopaedics. Malignant and non-malignant conditions including metabolic 
disorders, benign tumours and pharmacological therapies can be implicated. The 
majority of patients who present with suspected pathological fractures will be 
managed by general orthopaedic and trauma surgeons rather than specialists in 
orthopaedic oncology. Skeletal metastases can result in considerable morbidity 
and predispose to pathological fractures. With advances in the medical 
management of malignancy, life expectancy in cancer patients is increasing, 
leading to an increasing risk of skeletal metastasis and the potential for 
pathological fractures. Conventional modes of trauma fixation for pathological 
fractures may not be appropriate. The aim of this review is to outline 
diagnostic and management strategies for patients who present with a long bone 
fracture that is potentially pathological in nature.

Oxidative stress has long been associated with aging and has recently been 
linked to psychiatric disorders, including psychosis and depression. We 
identified multiple antipsychotics and antidepressants that extend 
Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and protect the animal from oxidative stress. 
Here, we report that atypical antidepressants activate a neuronal mechanism that 
regulates the response to oxidative stress throughout the animal. While the 
activation of the oxidative stress response by atypical antidepressants depends 
on synaptic transmission, the activation by reactive oxygen species does not. 
Lifespan extension by atypical antidepressants depends on the neuronal oxidative 
stress response activation mechanism. Neuronal regulation of the oxidative 
stress response is likely to have evolved as a survival mechanism to protect the 
organism from oxidative stress, upon detection of adverse or dangerous 
conditions by the nervous system.

BACKGROUND: This study presents age group-specific mortality rates and the 
average life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities in Germany.
METHOD: For two samples from Westphalia-Lippe and Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
person-related data for the years 2007-2009 were analysed. Age group-specific 
mortality rates were estimated by exponential regression analyses.
RESULTS: The average life expectancy of men with intellectual disabilities was 
70.9 years in Westphalia-Lippe and 65.3 years in the Baden-Wuerttemberg sample. 
Women with intellectual disabilities reached a life expectancy of 72.8 years in 
the Westphalian sample and 69.9 years in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The mortality 
tables, the crude mortality rates and the standardized mortality rates according 
to the WHO standard population are reported.
CONCLUSION: Comparing the results with other international studies, the trend of 
increasing life expectancies of people with intellectual disabilities is 
confirmed. People with intellectual disabilities still have a lower average life 
expectancy than the general population, partly due to subgroups with low life 
expectancies.

BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a rare group of genetic 
diseases which can lead to several serious long-term complications in newborns. 
In order to address these issues as early as possible, a process called tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used as it allows for rapid and simultaneous 
detection of the diseases. This analysis was performed to determine whether 
newborn screening by MS/MS is cost-effective in Thailand.
METHOD: A cost-utility analysis comprising a decision-tree and Markov model was 
used to estimate the cost in Thai baht (THB) and health outcomes in life-years 
(LYs) and quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) presented as an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The results were also adjusted to international 
dollars (I$) using purchasing power parities (PPP) (1 I$ = 17.79 THB for the 
year 2013). The comparisons were between 1) an expanded neonatal screening 
programme using MS/MS screening for six prioritised diseases: phenylketonuria 
(PKU); isovaleric acidemia (IVA); methylmalonic acidemia (MMA); propionic 
acidemia (PA); maple syrup urine disease (MSUD); and multiple carboxylase 
deficiency (MCD); and 2) the current practice that is existing PKU screening. A 
comparison of the outcome and cost of treatment before and after clinical 
presentations were also analysed to illustrate the potential benefit of early 
treatment for affected children. A budget impact analysis was conducted to 
illustrate the cost of implementing the programme for 10 years.
RESULTS: The ICER of neonatal screening using MS/MS amounted to 1,043,331 THB 
per QALY gained (58,647 I$ per QALY gained). The potential benefits of early 
detection compared with late detection yielded significant results for PKU, IVA, 
MSUD, and MCD patients. The budget impact analysis indicated that the 
implementation cost of the programme was expected at approximately 2,700 million 
THB (152 million I$) over 10 years.
CONCLUSION: At the current ceiling threshold, neonatal screening using MS/MS in 
the Thai context is not cost-effective. However, the treatment of patients who 
were detected early for PKU, IVA, MSUD, and MCD, are considered favourable. The 
budget impact analysis suggests that the implementation of the programme will 
incur considerable expenses under limited resources. A long-term epidemiological 
study on the incidence of IEM in Thailand is strongly recommended to ascertain 
the magnitude of problem.

BACKGROUND: In Guadeloupe, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the only vectors of 
dengue and chikungunya viruses. For both diseases, vector control is the only 
tool for preventing epidemics since no vaccine or specific treatment is 
available. However, to efficiently implement control of mosquitoes vectors, a 
reliable estimation of the transmission risks is necessary. To become infective 
an Ae. aegypti female must ingest the virus during a blood meal and will not be 
able to transmit the virus during another blood-meal until the extrinsic 
incubation period is completed. Consequently the aged females will carry more 
infectious risks. The objectives of the present study were to estimate under 
controlled conditions the expectation of infective life for females and thus the 
transmission risks in relation with their reproductive cycle and parity status.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Larvae of Ae. aegypti were collected in central 
Guadeloupe and breed under laboratory conditions until adult emergence. The 
experiments were performed at constant temperatures (± 1.5°C) of 24°C, 27°C and 
30°C on adults females from first generation (F1). Females were kept and fed 
individually and records of blood-feeding, egg-laying and survival were done 
daily. Some females were dissected at different physiological stages to observe 
the ovaries development. The data were analyzed to follow the evolution of 
parity rates, the number of gonotrophic cycles, the fecundity and to study the 
mean expectation of life and the mean expectation of infective life for Ae. 
aegypti females according to temperatures. The expectation of life varies with 
the parity rates and according to the temperatures, with durations from about 10 
days at low parity rates at the higher temperature to an optimal duration of 
about 35 days when 70% of females are parous at 27°C. Infective life expectancy 
was found highly variable in the lower parous rates and again the optimal 
durations were found when more than 50% of females are parous for the mean 
temperatures of 27°C and 30°C.
CONCLUSION: Parity rates can be determined for field collected females and could 
be a good proxy of the expectation of infective life according to temperatures. 
However, for the same parity rates, the estimation of infective life expectation 
is very different between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. 
Correlation of field parity rates with transmission risks requires absolutely to 
be based on Ae. aegypti models, since available Anopheles sp. models 
underestimate greatly the females longevity.

Menopause is a period that may predispose one to a decrease in muscle strength, 
cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life. A study was carried out to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of physical activity among women displaying 
symptoms of menopause. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on data from a 
six-month randomised controlled trial (n = 151). The women in the intervention 
group engaged in an unsupervised session of at least 50 minutes of physical 
activity four times a week. The control group continued their physical activity 
as before. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in 
terms of maximal oxygen consumption, lean muscle mass, and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained. A bootstrap technique was utilised to estimate uncertainty 
around the point estimate for ICER associated with the intervention. The mean 
total cost in the intervention group was €1,307 (SEM: €311) and in the control 
group was €1,253 (SEM: €279, p = 0.10) per person. The mean intervention cost 
was €208 per person. After six months of the behaviour-change intervention, the 
ICER was €63 for a 1 ml/kg/min improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, the 
additional cost per one-gram increase in lean muscle mass was €126, and the cost 
per QALY gained was €46. According to the findings, physical activity among 
menopausal women was cost-effective for cardiorespiratory fitness, for lean 
muscle mass, and for QALYs gained, since the intervention was more effective 
than the actions within the control group and the additional effects of physical 
activity were gained at a very low price. From the societal perspective, the 
intervention used may promote ability to work and thereby save on further costs 
associated with early retirement or disability pension if the physical-activity 
level remains at least the same as during the intervention.

CONTEXT: GLIS3 (GLI-similar 3) is a member of the GLI-similar zinc finger 
protein family encoding for a nuclear protein with 5 C2H2-type zinc finger 
domains. The protein is expressed early in embryogenesis and plays a critical 
role as both a repressor and activator of transcription. Human GLIS3 mutations 
are extremely rare.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was determine the phenotypic presentation 
of 12 patients with a variety of GLIS3 mutations.
METHODS: GLIS3 gene mutations were sought by PCR amplification and sequence 
analysis of exons 1 to 11. Clinical information was provided by the referring 
clinicians and subsequently using a questionnaire circulated to gain further 
information.
RESULTS: We report the first case of a patient with a compound heterozygous 
mutation in GLIS3 who did not present with congenital hypothyroidism. All 
patients presented with neonatal diabetes with a range of insulin sensitivities. 
Thyroid disease varied among patients. Hepatic and renal disease was common with 
liver dysfunction ranging from hepatitis to cirrhosis; cystic dysplasia was the 
most common renal manifestation. We describe new presenting features in patients 
with GLIS3 mutations, including craniosynostosis, hiatus hernia, atrial septal 
defect, splenic cyst, and choanal atresia and confirm further cases with 
sensorineural deafness and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: We report new findings within the GLIS3 phenotype, further extending 
the spectrum of abnormalities associated with GLIS3 mutations and providing 
novel insights into the role of GLIS3 in human physiological development. All 
but 2 of the patients within our cohort are still alive, and we describe the 
first patient to live to adulthood with a GLIS3 mutation, suggesting that even 
patients with a severe GLIS3 phenotype may have a longer life expectancy than 
originally described.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic hip fractures are common injuries typically occurring 
in patients who are older and medically frail. Studies have suggested that 
creation of a multidisciplinary team including orthopaedic surgeons, internal 
medicine physicians, social workers, and specialized physical therapists, to 
comanage these patients can decrease complication rates, improve time to 
surgery, and reduce hospital length of stay; however, they have yet to achieve 
widespread implementation, partly owing to concerns regarding resource 
requirements necessary for a comanagement program.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We performed an economic analysis to determine whether 
implementation of a comanagement model of care for geriatric patients with 
osteoporotic hip fractures would be a cost-effective intervention at hospitals 
with moderate volume. We also calculated what annual volume of cases would be 
needed for a comanagement program to "break even", and finally we evaluated 
whether universal or risk-stratified comanagement was more cost effective.
METHODS: Decision analysis techniques were used to model the effect of 
implementing a systems-based strategy to improve inpatient perioperative care. 
Costs were obtained from best-available literature and included salary to 
support personnel and resources to expedite time to the operating room. The 
major economic benefit was decreased initial hospital length of stay, which was 
determined via literature review and meta-analysis, and a health benefit was 
improvement in perioperative mortality owing to expedited preoperative 
evaluation based on previously conducted meta-analyses. A break-even analysis 
was conducted to determine the annual case volume necessary for comanagement to 
be either (1) cost effective (improve health-related quality of life enough to 
be worth additional expenses) or (2) result in cost savings (actually result in 
decreased total expenses). This calculation assumed the scenario in which a 
hospital could hire only one hospitalist (and therapist and social worker) on a 
full-time basis. Additionally, we evaluated the scenario where the necessary 
staff was already employed at the hospital and could be dedicated to a 
comanagement service on a part-time basis, and explored the effect of triaging 
only patients considered high risk to a comanagement service versus comanaging 
all geriatric patients. Finally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
conducted on all critical variables, with broad ranges used for values around 
which there was higher uncertainty.
RESULTS: For the base case, universal comanagement was more cost effective than 
traditional care and risk-stratified comanagement (incremental cost 
effectiveness ratios of USD 41,100 per quality-adjusted life-year and USD 81,900 
per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Comanagement was more cost 
effective than traditional management as long as the case volume was more than 
54 patients annually (range, 41-68 patients based on sensitivity analysis) and 
resulted in cost savings when there were more than 318 patients annually (range, 
238-397 patients). In a scenario where staff could be partially dedicated to a 
comanagement service, universal comanagement was more cost effective than 
risk-stratified comanagement (incremental cost effectiveness of USD 2300 per 
quality-adjusted life-year), and both comanagement programs had lower costs and 
better outcomes compared with traditional management. Sensitivity analysis was 
conducted and showed that the level of uncertainty in key variables was not high 
enough to change the core conclusions of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a systems-based comanagement strategy using a 
dedicated team to improve perioperative medical care and expedite preoperative 
evaluation is cost effective in hospitals with moderate volume and can result in 
cost savings at higher-volume centers. The optimum patient population for a 
comanagement strategy is still being defined.

Measuring health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important for 
tracking the health of individuals and populations over time. Generic HRQoL 
measures allow for comparison across health conditions. One form of generic 
HRQoL measures are profile measures, which provide a description of health 
across several different domains (such as physical functioning, depression, and 
pain). Recent advances in health profile measurement include the development of 
measures based on item response theory. The Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) has been constructed using this theory. 
Another form of generic HRQoL measures are utility measures, which assess the 
value of health states. Multi-attribute utility theory provides a framework for 
valuing disparate domains of health and aggregating them into a single 
preference-based score. Such a score provides an overall measure of health 
outcomes as well as a quality of life weight for use in decision analyses and 
cost-effectiveness analyses. Developing a utility score for PROMIS® would allow 
simultaneous estimation of both health profile and utility scores using a single 
measure. The purpose of this paper is to provide a roadmap of the methodological 
steps necessary to create such a scoring system.
