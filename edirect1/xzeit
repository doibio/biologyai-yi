Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and those already on dialysis have 
an increased prevalence of cardiovascular calcifications. They are the cause of 
severe complications and are associated with a reduced life expectancy in these 
patients. Recommendations and imaging scores have been developed to detect and 
assess their importance, to guide and improve the management of cardiovascular 
risk. However, despite these recommendations, current practice teaches us that 
they are only partially applied. The prevention and treatment of cardiovascular 
calcifications go through the correction of classic risk factors associated with 
atherosclerosis, mineral and bone metabolism disorders and by optimizing the 
dose and the efficiency of dialysis. New therapeutic strategies are beginning to 
emerge, others are being evaluated, such as sodium thiosulfate, rheopheresis, 
vitamin K, magnesium supplementation, and SNF-472.

Publisher: Les patients atteints de maladie rénale chronique (MRC) avancée et 
ceux déjà traités par dialyse présentent une prévalence accrue de calcifications 
cardiovasculaires. Elles sont à l’origine des complications sévères et 
s’associent à une diminution de l’espérance de vie chez ces patients. Des 
recommandations et des scores radiographiques ont été développés pour dépister 
et évaluer leur importance, afin d’orienter et améliorer la prise en charge du 
risque cardiovasculaire. Cependant, en dépit de ces recommandations, la pratique 
courante nous enseigne qu’elles ne sont que partiellement appliquées. La 
prévention et le traitement de calcifications cardiovasculaires passent par la 
correction des facteurs de risque classiques associés à l’athérosclérose, des 
troubles du métabolisme minéral et osseux et en optimisant la dose et 
l’efficacité de la dialyse. Des nouvelles stratégies thérapeutiques commencent à 
voir le jour, d’autres sont en cours d’évaluation, comme le thiosulfate de

Contemporary management of infective endocarditis in pregnancy.

Pollock A(1), Kiernan TJ(1).

Author information:

Ireland.

INTRODUCTION: Infective endocarditis (IE) during pregnancy is a rare condition 
that is associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality. The 
epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis have changed significantly in 
the last two decades. The declining incidence of rheumatic heart disease, 
improved life expectancy with congenital heart disease, advances in cardiac 
surgery and cardiac devices, rise in resistant microorganisms, complications of 
the opioid epidemic, and increasing maternal age are some of the many factors 
contributing to these changes.
AREAS COVERED: This article explores existing literature on the topic including 
case reports, case series, registry data, and clinical guidelines. The focus of 
this article is the evolving epidemiology, predisposing factors and preventative 
measures, clinical presentation, investigation, management, and potential 
complications of IE in pregnancy.
EXPERT OPINION: Robust prospective data on the management of IE in pregnancy is 
lacking, and obtaining these data will be very challenging. It is imperative 
that international registries are used to provide data on best clinical 
practices and inform future clinical guidelines. Multimodal imaging should be 
incorporated in the investigation of complicated cases. A multidisciplinary 
approach to the management of this rare and life-threatening condition is 
essential to ensure the best outcomes for both the mother and the fetus.

AIM: People with coexisting severe mental illness (SMI) and type 2 diabetes have 
a shorter life expectancy and poorer diabetes outcomes than those without SMI. 
This is partly explained by the separate treatment of diabetes and SMI, which 
occurs in parallel silos in many healthcare systems. The Steno Diabetes Center 
Sjaelland and Region Zealand established the Fusion Clinic to offer combined 
psychiatric and diabetes care delivered by both diabetes and mental healthcare 
professionals. This study describes how the clinic was established and the 
initial diabetes outcomes.
METHODS: The Fusion Clinic was co-designed by people with diabetes and SMI and 
healthcare professionals to improve the care of adults with diabetes and SMI. 
The clinic approach utilised the F-ACT model. The 63 people referred to the 
Fusion Clinic between 01.02.2020 and 01.01.2022 who attended the clinic for more 
than 6 months were included in this study. Diabetes outcomes were recorded in 
the electronic medical records (Sundhedsplatformen EPIC).
RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of diabetes complications at baseline. 
Furthermore, 70% had one or more additional concomitant diseases, as well as SMI 
and diabetes. Assessment of diabetes complications and measurements of HbA1c and 
lipid profile improved after referral to the clinic. HbA1c declined during the 
first 6 months of attendance at the clinic.
CONCLUSIONS: This model of service delivery has the potential to improve the 
quality of care for people with SMI and type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events are one of the most important causes of 
morbidity and mortality in the long-term follow-up of liver transplant 
recipients. Hypertension is a significant cardiovascular risk factor that occurs 
frequently after pediatric liver transplantation. Chronic use of 
immunosuppressants - mainly calcineurin inhibitors - plays a major role in the 
development of post-transplant hypertension and circadian disturbances such as 
flattening of the nocturnal blood pressure dip. This requires special attention 
in children given the long timeframe during which immunosuppressive therapy is 
necessary. Careful and structured blood pressure monitoring and adequate 
treatment of hypertension are essential to optimize the quality of life and life 
expectancy of pediatric liver transplant patients. However, evidence-based 
guidelines for monitoring and management of post-transplant hypertension and its 
complications are lacking.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and 
practices concerning post-transplant hypertension. The databases Pubmed, Embase, 
Web of Science and Google Scholar were scanned with the following keywords: 
pediatric liver transplantation, immunosuppression, tacrolimus, cardiovascular 
effects, hypertension, heart function, kidney function, circadian rhythm, 
mechanism, monitoring, and management.
RESULTS: In this review, we describe the incidence and etiology of hypertension 
in pediatric liver transplant recipients, the underlying mechanisms and 
characteristics of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension, and the 
consequences of and risk factors for post-transplant hypertension. We hereby 
present an overview of the current practices in blood pressure monitoring and 
antihypertensive treatment as well as an algorithm for the evaluation and 
management of hypertension post liver transplantation. Finally, we discuss 
knowledge gaps and suggestions for future research.

PURPOSE: The availability of a simple and reliable marker of biological age 
might allow an acceleration of the research in the field of longevity extension. 
Previous studies suggest that this marker might be the N-terminal of B-type 
natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP), from which proBNPage, a biological 
age surrogate, can be calculated. Objectives of the study: 1) To fine-tune the 
method of proBNPage progression assessment and 2) To establish whether 4 
"anti-aging" treatments, which provided promising results in previous studies, 
can modify proBNPage progression.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled 
clinical trial on 120 adults aged 65-80 years, free of cardiovascular diseases. 
Participants will be randomized into 3 groups: A) Coenzyme Q10 100 mg bid + 
Selenium 100 mcg; B) Resveratrol 350 mg bid + TA-65 (Astragalus Membranaceus 
extract) 100U; C) Placebo-1 bid + Placebo-2. They will be followed for 2 years 
and checked 8 times, to assess both proBNPage progression and treatment safety. 
Secondary variables (handgrip strength, aerobic capacity at the step test and 
quality of life) will also be assessed. Primary outcome will be the 
demonstration of significant changes of proBNPage, compared to baseline, in the 
3 groups at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Secondary outcome will be the demonstration 
of similar changes of secondary variables. Statistical analyses will be mainly 
performed by repeated measures ANOVA (both according to intention to treat and 
per protocol) and paired t tests. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
Area Vasta Emilia Centro, Emilia-Romagna Region, ID: 64/2022/Sper/AOUBo. Trial 
registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05500742.
CONCLUSION: The use of proBNPage as a surrogate of biological age may prove an 
easy method to select anti-aging treatments worthy of further, more complex 
assessments.

BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of elderly and frail patients with secondary 
mitral valve regurgitation (MR) are inconclusive. Especially in patients with 
co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis who are suffering from heart failure, 
optimal medical therapy (OMT) is the preferred therapy relative to surgical or 
percutaneous interventions. It remains challenging to identify the most 
successful therapy to improve symptoms and increase life expectancy. To reduce 
surgical trauma for these patients, minimally invasive mitral valve surgery 
(MIMVS) was developed; this has shown promising medium-term results, but there 
is still a lack of evidence regarding long-term results. The aim of this 
investigation was to describe the long-term outcomes of less invasive mitral 
valve surgery (MVS) in elderly patients.
METHODS: In this longitudinal retrospective analysis, 67 patients (aged ≥70 
years) with secondary MR who underwent MV repair ± tricuspid valve repair (TVR) 
were identified. MVS was performed via minithoracotomy (MT) in most cases 
(n = 54); in patients with contraindications for MIMVS, partial upper sternotomy 
(PS) was the preferred route for surgical access (n = 13). The appropriate 
access route was chosen according to the patient's clinical condition and 
comorbidities. We analyzed reoperation-free long-term survival, combined 
operative success (lack of residual MR, conversion to MV replacement, or larger 
thoracic incisions), and perioperative safety (at 30 days: mortality, 
re-thoracotomy, ECMO, pacemaker implantation, dialysis, longer ventilation, 
stroke, myocardial infarction). In a subgroup analysis, we compared long-term 
survival in MVS patients with and without TVR.
RESULTS: The median age of patients (62.7% female) was 74 years (interquartile 
range: 72-76 years), with a median EuroSCORE2 of 2.8% (1.5%-4.6%) and N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide plasma levels of 1,434 ng/L (1035-2149 ng/L). The 
median follow-up period was 5.6 years (2.7-8.5 years). The reoperation-free 
long-term survival rate up to 10 years was 66.2%. Combined operative success and 
perioperative safety were achieved in 94% and 76% of patients, respectively. 
Additional TVR was performed in 56.7% of patients, without any significant 
difference in survival rates compared to the group without TVR (p = 0.417; HR 
1.473, 95% CI 0.578-3.757).
CONCLUSION: Less invasive MV repair for secondary MR shows excellent operative 
success and safety in selected patients. Freedom from significant MR and from 
the need for reoperation indicates long-lasting efficacy. These results should 
be considered in heart team discussions regarding allocation of patients to 
surgical mitral procedures.

Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for most patients with kidney 
failure. For patients with a prior history of treated cancers, listing and 
transplant eligibility decisions are complex. Patients and health professionals 
are obliged to consider the time-periods between cancer cure and 
transplantation, the risk of cancer recurrence under the influence of 
immunosuppression and anti-cancer treatment options if the disease recurs. 
Cancer recurrence is associated with a high mortality rate, thus potentially 
reduces the projected survival benefit of transplantation, and dampens the 
utility of scarce organs. In view of the uncertain risk of harms, clinicians may 
consider transplantation for candidates with prior cancer history only after an 
extended period of cancer-free interval, as the fear of disease recurrence and 
shortened life expectancy may outweigh the benefits of receiving a kidney 
transplant compared with dialysis. Over the past decade, the evolution of novel 
anti-cancer therapies coupled with improved understanding of cancer genomics 
have led to considerable improvement in cancer-free survival. It is therefore 
justifiable to make individualized transplant suitability decisions based the 
joint effects of cancer biology, available therapeutic options and prognostic 
covariates on clinical outcomes. In this review, we first summarized the cancer 
epidemiology in kidney transplant recipients. We then explored how the 
probability of cancer cure, risk of recurrence and outcomes in candidates with a 
prior cancer history may influence the decisions to transplant. Finally, the 
role of shared decision-making between health professionals and patients 
regarding the optimal management options, and considerations of patients' 
preferences and values are discussed.

Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

BACKGROUND: Lebanon is one of the world's smallest countries, with an area of 
10,452 square kilometers. Life expectancy in Lebanon presently stands at about 
76.6 years for men and 79.3 years for women. It is well known that with long 
life comes chronic disease, serious illness, and increased resource utilization. 
With a rapidly aging population and ever-increasing life expectancy, an increase 
in illnesses that affect the elderly is expected to follow, including 
non-communicable diseases and cancer. Nurses are the largest workforce in 
Lebanon and are thus in a prominent position to influence the quality of 
palliative care (PC) delivery throughout the course of illness.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational 
workshop on PC knowledge, attitude, and skills for practicing nurses at a 
Lebanese university medical center.
DESIGN: A mixed-method approach comprising a quasi-experimental and a 
qualitative process evaluation was followed to assess the nurses' knowledge, 
attitude, and skills about PC before and after the workshop and to evaluate the 
process itself. A convenience sample of 45 registered nurses working at the 
university medical center from multiple clinical units participated in the 
workshop that took place over one day in a referral medical center in Beirut. 
Inferential statistical analysis was used.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed using SPSS 25 for Windows. The paired t test showed 
a significant increase between the pre-and post-test scores t (39) = 11.07, 
p < 0.001 with a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference of 
(17.58-25.45). Thirty-eight participants (90.5%) did not pass the pre-test exam 
whereas only 12 participants (30.0%) did not pass the post-test exam.
RECOMMENDATIONS: It is highly recommended to follow up with the participants of 
this workshop to determine the immediate and long-term outcomes of this 
educational workshop as well as offer workshops for a wider population of nurses 
in Lebanon and the region.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a hereditary cardiac condition 
characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy without a hemodynamic 
cause. This condition is prevalent in the United States, resulting in various 
clinical manifestations, including diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular 
outflow obstruction, cardiac ischemia, and atrial fibrillation. HCM is 
associated with several genetic mutations, with sarcomeric mutations being the 
most common and contributing to a more complex disease course. Early diagnosis 
of HCM is essential for effective management, as late diagnosis often requires 
invasive treatments and creates a substantial financial burden. Disparities in 
HCM diagnosis and treatment exist between high-income and low-income countries. 
High-income countries have more resources to investigate and implement advanced 
diagnostic and treatment modalities. In contrast, low-income countries face 
challenges in accessing diagnostic equipment, trained personnel, and affordable 
medications, leading to a lower quality of life and life expectancy for affected 
individuals. Diagnostic tools for HCM include imaging studies such as 2D 
echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). CMR is considered the gold standard but remains 
inaccessible to a significant portion of the world's population, especially in 
low-income countries. Genetics plays a crucial role in HCM, with numerous 
mutations identified in various genes. Genetic counseling is essential but often 
limited in low-income countries due to resource constraints. Disparities in 
healthcare access and adherence to treatment recommendations exist between 
high-income and low-income countries, leading to differences in patient 
outcomes. Addressing these disparities is essential to improve the overall 
management of HCM on a global scale. In conclusion, this review highlights the 
complex nature of HCM, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, genetic 
counseling, and access to appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. 
Addressing healthcare disparities is crucial to ensure that all individuals with 
HCM receive timely and effective care, regardless of their geographic location 
or socioeconomic status.

The majority of patients with constipation can often be treated conservatively 
with laxatives, suppositories, or enemas in mild cases. However, endoscopic 
decompression or surgical intervention may be required in some instances. 
Abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of constipation is rarely seen in the 
literature. We report a case of faecal impaction, which led to abdominal 
compartment syndrome in an adult patient with cerebral palsy. With increasing 
life expectancy, such cases may be increasingly encountered in the adult 
population. Severe complications of constipation should not be overlooked, 
especially in this at-risk population. Early recognition of abdominal 
compartment syndrome is key in its management.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate 10-year mortality, causes of death 
and cardiovascular comorbidity in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 
(iNPH) and to evaluate their mutual associations.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 176 CSF-shunted iNPH patients, 
and 368 age- and sex-matched controls. At inclusion, participants were medically 
examined, had blood analyzed and answered a questionnaire. The vascular 
comorbidities investigated were smoking, diabetes, body mass index, blood 
pressure (BP), hyperlipidemia, kidney function, atrial fibrillation and, 
cerebro- and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: Survival was observed for a mean period of 10.3 ± 0.84 years. Shunted 
iNPH patients had an increased risk of death compared to controls (hazard ratio 
(HR) = 2.5, 95% CI 1.86-3.36; p < 0.001). After 10 years, 50% (n = 88) of iNPH 
patients and 24% (n = 88) of the controls were dead (p < 0.001). The risk of 
dying from cardiovascular disease, falls and neurological diseases were higher 
in iNPH (p < 0.05). The most common cause of death in iNPH was cardiovascular 
diseases (14% vs 7% for controls). Seven out of nine iNPH dying from falls had 
subdural hematomas. Systolic BP (HR = 0.985 95% CI 0.972-0.997, p = 0.018), 
atrial fibrillation (HR = 2.652, 95% CI 1.506-4.872, p < 0.001) and creatinine 
(HR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.010-1.027, p < 0.001) were independently associated with 
mortality for iNPH.
DISCUSSION: This long-term and population-matched cohort study indicates that in 
spite of CSF-shunt treatment, iNPH has shorter life expectancy. It may be 
important to treat iNPH in supplementary ways to reduce mortality. Both 
cardiovascular comorbidities and lethal falls are contributing to the excess 
mortality in iNPH and reducing these preventable risks should be an established 
part of the treatment plan.

BACKGROUND: People with disabilities (PWDs) are often excluded from biomedical 
research, but comprehensive data regarding their participation in clinical 
trials are not available. The objective of this study was to assess the rates of 
exclusion of PWDs from recent medical scientific research.
METHODS: The protocol of the study was designed according to PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension 
for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. All completed interventional clinical trials 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between 2010 and 2020 regarding the 10 leading 
causes of global disability-adjusted life-years according to the Global Burden 
of Disease Study were analysed. An exclusion criterion from the study was 
considered explicit if it could be associated with one of the following seven 
categories: disability, physical impairment, cognitive impairment, behavioural 
or psychiatric disorders, language and communication impairment, sensory 
impairment. Comorbidities not more clearly defined and researcher discretion 
regarding exclusion of study participants were considered to be 'implicit 
exclusion criteria'. We assessed the appropriateness of explicit exclusion 
criteria in relation to the primary objectives of the trials and labelled them 
as 'absolute', 'relative' or 'questionable'.
RESULTS: The total number of trials analysed was 2710; 170 were paediatric 
trials (6.3%), 2374 were adult trials (87.6%) and 166 were trials including 
subjects of all ages (6.1%). Explicit exclusion criteria were found in 958 
trials (35.3%). The disability category most frequently excluded was behavioural 
or psychiatric disorders, present in 588 trials (61.4%). In only 3% and 1% of 
the trials, the exclusion criteria were considered either 'absolute' or 
'questionable', while in 96% the exclusion criteria were judged as 'relative'. 
Implicit exclusion criteria were present in 1205 trials (44.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high rate of exclusion of PWDs from 
biomedical research and the widespread use of ill-defined exclusion criteria in 
clinical trials. It underscores the importance of more inclusive study designs 
so that PWDs can become active participants in research.

INTRODUCTION: Geriatric Fracture Centers (GFCs) are dedicated treatment units 
where care is tailored towards elderly patients who have suffered fragility 
fractures. The primary objective of this economic analysis was to determine the 
cost-utility of GFCs compared with usual care centres.
METHODS: The primary analysis was a cost-utility analysis that measured the cost 
per incremental quality-adjusted life-year gained from treatment of hip fracture 
in GFCs compared with treatment in usual care centres from the societal 
perspective over a 1-year time horizon. The secondary analysis was a 
cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon. 
We evaluated these outcomes using a cost-utility analysis using data from a 
large multicentre prospective cohort study comparing GFCs versus usual care 
centres that took place in Austria, Spain, the USA, the Netherlands, Thailand 
and Singapore.
RESULTS: GFCs may be cost-effective in the long term, while providing a more 
comprehensive care plan. Patients in usual care centre group were slightly older 
and had fewer comorbidities. For the 1-year analysis, the costs per patient were 
slightly lower in the GFC group (-$646.42), while the quality-adjusted 
life-years were higher in the usual care centre group (+0.034). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $18 863.34 (US$/quality-adjusted life-year). The 
lifetime horizon analysis found that the costs per patient were lower in the GFC 
group (-$7210.35), while the quality-adjusted life-years were higher in the 
usual care centre group (+0.02). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$320 678.77 (US$/quality-adjusted life-year).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis found that GFCs were associated with lower costs 
compared with usual care centres. The cost-savings were greater when the 
lifetime time horizon was considered. This comprehensive cost-effectiveness 
analysis, using data from an international prospective cohort study, found that 
GFC may be cost-effective in the long term, while providing a more comprehensive 
care plan. A greater number of major adverse events were reported at GFC, 
nevertheless a lower mortality rate associated with these adverse events at GFC. 
Due to the minor utility benefits, which may be a result of greater adverse 
event detection within the GFC group and much greater costs of usual care 
centres, the GFC may be cost-effective due to the large cost-savings it 
demonstrated over the lifetime time horizon, while potentially identifying and 
treating adverse events more effectively. These findings suggest that the GFC 
may be a cost-effective option over the lifetime of a geriatric patient with hip 
fracture, although future research is needed to further validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: The optimal timing for discontinuing screening of prostate cancer 
(PCa) in elderly men is currently not known and remains debated.
OBJECTIVE: To assess prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in elderly men 
who previously underwent prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening and to 
identify those who may benefit from continued screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7052 men, who participated in the 
screening arm of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of 
Screening for Prostate Cancer and were aged 70-74 yr at their last screening 
visit after undergoing a maximum of three screening rounds without being 
diagnosed with PCa, were included.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The cumulative incidence of PCSM 
by the age of 85 yr was assessed. Additionally, a competing risk regression was 
performed to assess the potential predictors of PCSM.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median follow-up was 16 yr. The cumulative 
incidence of PCSM by the age of 85 yr was 0.54% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.40-0.70) in all men, 0.11% (95% CI: 0.05-0.27) in men with PSA <2 ng/ml, 0.85% 
(95% CI: 0.47-1.5) in men with PSA 2-3 ng/ml, and 6.8% (95% CI: 3.1-15) in men 
with PSA ≥6.5 ng/ml and no previous benign biopsy. PSA (subdistribution hazard 
ratio [sHR]: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.7-2.3), previous benign prostate biopsy (sHR: 0.41; 
95% CI: 0.23-0.72), and hypertension (sHR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.25-0.91) were 
significantly associated with PCSM.
CONCLUSIONS: Men aged 70-74 yr who have previously undergone PSA-based screening 
without receiving a PCa diagnosis have a very low risk of dying from PCa by the 
age of 85 yr. These data suggest that screening may be discontinued in men with 
PSA <3.0 ng/ml or previous benign prostate biopsies. Those with higher PSA 
levels and no prior biopsies may consider continued screening if life expectancy 
exceeds 10 yr.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This study shows that men who participated in a prostate cancer 
screening trial have a very low risk of dying from prostate cancer if they have 
not been diagnosed with prostate cancer by the age of 74 yr.

Navigating the management complexity in long-term asymptomatic immunodeficiency.

Park K, Wang Q, Lee RU.

Background: Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is a condition 
associated with recurrent infections and non-infectious outcomes, including lung 
disease like bronchiectasis and granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung 
diseases (GLILD), autoimmune disease, enteropathy, and lymphoma. Treatment 
involves initiation of replacement immunoglobulin (Ig), which is a lifelong 
commitment. Prior to Ig replacement, life expectancy for patients with CVID was 
less than 15 years. With replacement Ig, it has improved to over 50 years. In 
most cases, patients present to a clinician with a history of recurrent 
infections, and treatment is indicated. However, in patients with asymptomatic 
disease, the best timing to start treatment can be difficult to determine. Case: 
We present a case of an otherwise healthy male who had an incidental diagnosis 
of CVID. Results: Workup revealed hypogammaglobulinemia for over 30 year. 
Discussion: Though successful in reducing infections, Ig replacement can come 
with many side effects, as well as a heavy medical burden to the patient and the 
healthcare system. It is also a big life adjustment, and can greatly affect a 
patient's quality of life. In the military, a diagnosis of an immunodeficiency, 
and the need for monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be detrimental to 
deployment readiness, and a patient's military career. Risks and benefits need 
to be weighed prior to initiating Ig therapy.

Bridging the gap in cardiovascular care in diabetic patients: are 
cardioprotective antihyperglycemic agents underutilized?

INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure 
(HF) are two major complications of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Cardiovascular 
protection is a key objective, yet not fully reached in clinical practice.
AREAS COVERED: Both glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have proven their efficacy 
in reducing major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with T2DM and 
SGLT2is in reducing hospitalization for HF in placebo-controlled randomized 
trials. However, real-life studies worldwide revealed that only a minority of 
patients with T2DM receive either a GLP-1RA or an SGLT2i and surprisingly even 
less patients with established ASCVD or HF are treated with these 
cardioprotective antihyperglycemic agents.
EXPERT OPINION: Bridging the gap between evidence-based cardiovascular 
protection with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is and their underuse in daily clinical 
practice in patients with T2DM at high risk is crucial from a public health 
viewpoint. However, the task appears hazardous and the goal not attained 
considering the current failure. Education of specialists/primary care 
physicians and patients is critical. Multifaceted and coordinated interventions 
involving all actors (physicians, patients and broadly health-care system) must 
be implemented to stimulate the adoption of these cardioprotective 
antihyperglycemic medications as part of routine cardiovascular care among 
patients with T2DM.

Plain Language Summary: Type 2 diabetes can lead to major cardiovascular 
complications including cardiovascular disease linked to narrowing of the 
arteries (atherosclerosis), and heart failure. These complications are 
associated with lower quality of life and life expectancy. Thus, cardiovascular 
protection in people with type 2 diabetes is an important objective. However, 
clinical practice often fails in fully achieving this goal.Two types of 
medications that lower blood sugar (so-called antidiabetic agents) have shown 
efficacy in reducing major cardiovascular events (such as strokes and heart 
attacks) in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. One of them has also shown 
effectiveness in decreasing hospitalizations due to heart failure. However, in 
clinical practice, most patients with type 2 diabetes do not receive these 
medications, even people with known cardiovascular disease or heart failure, 
despite the proven effectiveness of these drugs. Many studies worldwide have 
highlighted socioeconomic inequities regarding the use of these medications, 
which can be expensive.From a public health perspective, it is imperative to 
bridge the gap between the under-use of cardioprotective antidiabetic agents in 
routine daily practice among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes and the 
clear-cut recommendations of international guidelines. Given the current 
limitations, this task appears challenging. Education of physicians (both 
primary care practitioners and specialists, including cardiologists) and 
patients is most important in addressing this issue. Finally, in every country, 
the global health-care system should facilitate the use of these agents among 
patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and heart failure.

BACKGROUND: The effect of the combination of prednisolone, azathioprine, and 
acetylcysteine for the treatment of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is 
minimal. We aimed to investigate the effect of these drugs in case of 
intolerance to new anti-fibrotic drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This historical prospective study was performed on 91 
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who were referred to a pulmonologist 
in Mashhad during 2016-2020. Patients were divided into two groups, Pirfenidone 
which was prescribed for 46 subjects, and a combination of prednisolone, 
azathioprine, and acetylcysteine which was prescribed for 45 subjects. Patients 
were selected by convenience sampling and a life expectancy comparison between 
the two groups was performed by Cox regression.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between age, 
gender, and drug type in the two groups at the beginning of treatment. The death 
rate per year in the triple-drug treatment group was 44.44% (n = 20) and in the 
Pirfenidone treatment group was 11.08% (n=2). Of the 65 recovered population, 
49% (22 patients) were in the triple-drug treatment group, and 78% (36 patients) 
were in the Pirfenidone treatment group which indicated that Pirfenidone has a 
significant impact on reducing death rate compared to triple-drug treatment 
(pvalue=0.003 <0.05). Pirfenidone decreased the risk of death, compared to 
triple therapy (0.23 when death was set up as one in the triple-therapy group).
CONCLUSION: Pirfenidone has a favorable effect on increasing life expectancy and 
triple therapy should be considered as short-term only in subjects intolerant to 
anti-fibrotic.

BACKGROUND: Although various total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implant designs are 
widely used, the ideal TKA design is yet to be agreed upon. Although the 
benefits of cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA and medial stabilized (MS) TKA have been 
reported in literature, the early clinical outcomes of an MS TKA with CR inserts 
have not been reported. This study aims to report on the patient-reported 
clinical and radiological outcomes of MS-TKA combined with a CR insert.
METHODS: A prospective single-surgeon series evaluated the clinical- and 
patient-reported outcomes of 115 patients implanted with GMK Sphere CR. Patient 
outcomes were assessed with the Oxford Knee Score, Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS), Forgotten Joint Score, and Visual Analogue 
Scale for Satisfaction. Radiological assessment for alignment along with active 
flexion and extension were also assessed.
RESULTS: Improvement in all scores was observed between the preoperative and 
1-year follow-up timepoints, with statistical significance seen for Oxford Knee 
Score as well as KOOS Symptoms, Pain, Sport, quality of life, and activities of
