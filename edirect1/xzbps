OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dibotermin alfa compared with 
autologous iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) for patients undergoing single level 
lumbar interbody spinal fusion in a UK hospital setting.
METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of six randomized 
controlled clinical trials and two single arm trials compared dibotermin alfa on 
an absorbable collagen implantation matrix (ACIM) (n = 456) and ICBG (n = 244) 
on resource use, re-operation rates, and SF-6D (Short form 6-dimension) health 
utility (total N = 700). Failure-related second surgery, operating time, 
post-operative hospital stay, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived 
from the IPD meta-analysis were included as inputs in an economic evaluation 
undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of dibotermin alfa/ACIM versus ICBG 
for patients undergoing single level lumbar interbody spinal fusion. A four year 
time horizon and the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) and 
Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective was adopted in the base case, with 
sensitivity analyses performed to gauge parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, patients treated using dibotermin alfa/ACIM 
(12 mg pack) accrued 0.055 incremental QALYs at an incremental cost of £ 737, 
compared with patients treated with ICBG. This resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £ 13,523, indicating that at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20,000, dibotermin alfa/ACIM is a 
cost-effective intervention relative to ICBG from the NHS and PSS perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: In a UK hospital setting, dibotermin alfa/ACIM is a cost-effective 
substitute for ICBG for patients who require lumbar interbody arthrodesis.

After the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 
nursing-home residents and staff were evacuated voluntarily from damaged areas 
to avoid radiation exposure. Unfortunately, the evacuation resulted in increased 
mortalities among nursing home residents. We assessed the risk trade-off between 
evacuation and radiation for 191 residents and 184 staff at three nursing homes 
by using the same detriment indicator, namely loss of life expectancy (LLE), 
under four scenarios, i.e. "rapid evacuation (in accordance with the actual 
situation; i.e. evacuation on 22 March)," "deliberate evacuation (i.e. 
evacuation on 20 June)," "20-mSv exposure," and "100-mSv exposure." The LLE from 
evacuation-related mortality among nursing home residents was assessed with 
survival probability data from nursing homes in the city of Minamisoma and the 
city of Soma. The LLE from radiation mortality was calculated from the estimated 
age-specific mortality rates from leukemia and all solid cancers based on the 
additional effective doses and the survival probabilities. The total LLE of 
residents due to evacuation-related risks in rapid evacuation was 11,000 
persons-d-much higher than the total LLEs of residents and staff due to 
radiation in the other scenarios (27, 1100, and 5800 persons-d for deliberate 
evacuation, 20 mSv-exposure, and 100 mSv-exposure, respectively). The latitude 
for reducing evacuation risks among nursing home residents is surprisingly 
large. Evacuation regulation and planning should therefore be well balanced with 
the trade-offs against radiation risks. This is the first quantitative 
assessment of the risk trade-off between radiation exposure and evacuation after 
a nuclear power plant accident.

Worldwide, in the past few decades, the demographics of older people (ie, people 
55 years and over) with schizophrenia have changed completely with respect to 
absolute numbers of people affected, the proportion of all people with the 
disorder, life expectancy, and residential status. The ageing schizophrenia 
population has created vast health-care needs and their medical comorbidity 
contributes to higher mortality than in the general population. Proposals to 
classify schizophrenia into early-onset, late-onset, and very-late-onset 
subtypes now should be tempered by the recognition that comorbid medical and 
neurological disorders can contribute to psychotic symptoms in later life. The 
concept of outcome has become more nuanced with an appreciation that various 
outcomes can occur, largely independent of each other, that need different 
treatment approaches. Data show that schizophrenia in later life is not a stable 
end-state but one of fluctuation in symptoms and level of functioning, and show 
that pathways to improvement and recovery exist. Several novel 
non-pharmacological treatment strategies have been devised that can augment the 
clinical options used to address the specific needs of older adults with 
schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental ill health are three times more likely to 
smoke but typically do not access conventional smoking cessation services, 
contributing to widening health inequalities and reduced life expectancy. We 
aimed to pilot an intervention targeted at smokers with severe mental ill health 
and to test methods of recruitment, randomisation, and follow up before 
implementing a full trial.
METHODS: The Smoking Cessation Intervention for Severe Mental Ill Health Trial 
(SCIMITAR) is a pilot randomised controlled trial of a smoking cessation 
strategy designed specifically for people with severe mental ill health, to be 
delivered by mental health nurses and consisting of behavioural support and 
drugs, compared with a conventional smoking cessation service (ie, usual care). 
Adults (aged 18 years or older) with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, who were 
current smokers, were recruited from NHS primary care and mental health settings 
in the UK (York, Scarborough, Hull, and Manchester). Eligible participants were 
randomly allocated to either usual care (control group) or usual care plus the 
bespoke smoking cessation strategy (intervention group). Randomisation was done 
via a central telephone system, with computer-generated random numbers. We could 
not mask participants, family doctors, and researchers to the treatment 
allocation. Our primary outcome was smoking status at 12 months, verified by 
carbon monoxide measurements or self-report. Only participants who provided an 
exhaled CO measurement or self-reported their smoking status at 12 months were 
included in the primary analysis. The trial is registered at ISRCTN.com, number 
ISRCTN79497236.
FINDINGS: Of 97 people recruited to the pilot study, 51 were randomly allocated 
to the control group and 46 were assigned to the intervention group. 
Participants engaged well with the bespoke smoking cessation strategy, but no 
individuals assigned to usual care accessed NHS smoking cessation services. At 
12 months, 35 (69%) controls and 33 (72%) people assigned to the intervention 
group provided a CO measurement or self-reported their smoking status. Smoking 
cessation was highest among individuals who received the bespoke intervention 
(12/33 [36%] vs 8/35 [23%]; adjusted odds ratio 2·9, 95% CI 0·8-10·5).
INTERPRETATION: We have shown the feasibility of recruiting and randomising 
people with severe mental ill health in a trial of this nature. The level of 
engagement with a bespoke smoking cessation strategy was higher than with a 
conventional approach. The effectiveness and safety of a smoking cessation 
programme designed particularly for people with severe mental ill health should 
be tested in a fully powered randomised controlled trial.

The outcomes and management of colorectal liver metastasis have undergone many 
changes. The incidence of recurrence after liver resection for hepatic 
metastasis remains very high. Liver resection, which provides the only curative 
treatment, is believed to have improved the long-term outcome of these patients. 
However, the management and outcomes of patients with colorectal liver 
metastasis have greatly improved in the last decade, suggesting that the current 
use of aggressive multimodality treatments, including surgical resection 
combined with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, effectively prolong the life 
expectancy of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation has become an organized, routine, widely used 
method in the treatment of several end-stage diseases. Kidney transplantation 
means the best life-quality and longest life expectancy for patients with 
end-stage renal diseases. Transplantation is the only available long-term 
medical treatment for patients with end-stage liver, heart, and lung diseases. 
Despite the number of transplantations increasing worldwide, the needs of the 
waiting lists remain below expectations.
METHODS: One of the few methods to increase the number of transplantations is 
public education. In cooperation with the University of Debrecen Institute for 
Surgery Department of Transplantation, the Hungarian National Blood Transfusion 
Service Organ Coordination Office, and the Local Committee Debrecen of Hungarian 
Medical Students' International Relations Committee (HuMSIRC), the Gerundium, a 
new educational program, has been established to serve this target. Gerundium is 
a special program designed especially for youth education. Peer education means 
that age-related medical student volunteers educate their peers during 
interactive unofficial sessions.
RESULTS: Volunteers were trained during specially designed training. Medical 
students were honored by HuMSIRC, depending on their activity on the basis of 
their own regulations. Uniform slides and brochures to share were designed. 
Every Hungarian secondary school was informed. The Local Committee Budapest of 
HuMSIRC also joined the program, which helps to expand our activity throughout 
Hungary. The aim of the program is public education to help disperse 
disapproval, if presented.
CONCLUSIONS: As a multiple effect, our program promotes medical students to have 
better skills in the field of transplantation, presentation, and communication 
skills. Our program is a voluntary program with strong professional support and 
is free of charge for the community.

INTRODUCTION: Acute appendicitis represents the commonest cause of acute 
intra-abdominal pathology. Appendectomy and antibiotics are the mainstay of 
therapy for appendicitis. Evidence is emerging that antibiotics alone may 
adequately treat most cases of appendicitis. Decision analysis is a quantitative 
method of examining alternate treatment strategies. This study describes a 
modelled decision analysis comparing operative and conservative management of 
appendicitis.
METHODS: The base case patient is a healthy, 23-year-old male presenting with 
migratory pain to the right iliac fossa (RIF) and elevated inflammatory markers. 
A decision tree was constructed comparing operative and conservative treatment. 
Rates of complications, failure of conservative therapy, recurrence and 
utilities were calculated via a systematic literature review. Variables were 
tested for sensitivity.
RESULTS: Overall, conservative management gives a significantly better outcome 
(51.51 vs 49.87 QALYs). Three variables proved sensitive. Once operative 
complication rates are lower than 11.5 %, surgical treatment becomes the optimal 
strategy. If rates of failure of conservative management exceed 12.9 %, surgery 
becomes optimal. If the utility assigned to a post-operative complication 
exceeds 0.44, surgery becomes optimal.
CONCLUSIONS: This decision analysis supports a conservative strategy, albeit 
with caveats. If operative complications are low or rates of failure of 
conservative management remain high, surgery is the preferable strategy.

This article discusses abuse and neglect of elderly women in Ghana and the 
traditional practices that adversely affect their human rights. Their situation 
is characterized by pervasive poverty, illiteracy, widowhood, predominantly 
rural dwelling, and subjection to insidious cultural practices and superstitious 
beliefs. Increase in life expectancy and population trends point to significant 
increases in the numbers of the elderly women. Breakdown of the extended family 
support system and the waning of filial obligations are factors affecting their 
welfare. Accurate data on these abuses is lacking due to cultural inhibitions 
and non-reporting. Legislations and NGO programs are addressed to combat abuses.

    Lancet Infect Dis. 2015 Dec;15(12):1372-3.

BACKGROUND: Adults aged 65 years and older account for most seasonal 
influenza-related hospital admissions and deaths. Findings from the randomised 
controlled FIM12 study showed that high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine is 
more effective than standard-dose vaccine for prevention of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza in this age group. We aimed to assess the economic impact of high-dose 
versus standard-dose influenza vaccine in participants in the FIM12 study 
population.
METHODS: The FIM12 study was a head-to-head randomised controlled trial in which 
31,989 participants aged 65 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
receive either high-dose or standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza 
vaccine over two influenza seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13). Data for health-care 
resource consumption obtained in the FIM12 study were summarised across vaccine 
groups. Unit costs obtained from standard US cost sources were applied to each 
resource item, including to the vaccines (high dose US$31·82, standard dose 
$12·04). Clinical illness data were mapped to existing quality-of-life data. The 
time horizon was one influenza season; however, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) lost due to death during the study were calculated over a lifetime. We 
calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for high-dose versus 
standard-dose vaccine and used QALYs as an outcome in the cost-utility analysis. 
We undertook a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping to explore 
the effect of statistical uncertainty on the study results.
FINDINGS: Mean per-participant medical costs were lower in the high-dose vaccine 
group ($1376·72 [SD 6857·59]) than in the standard-dose group ($1492·64 
[7447·14]; difference -$115·92 [95% CI -264·18 to 35·48]). Mean societal costs 
were likewise lower in the high-dose versus the standard-dose group ($1506·48 
[SD 7305·19] vs $1634·50 [7952·99]; difference -$128·02 [95% CI -286·89 to 
33·30]). Hospital admissions contributed 95% of the total health-care-payer cost 
and 87% of the total societal costs. The mean per-participant number of hospital 
admissions was 0·0937 (SD 0·3644) in the high-dose group and 0·1017 (0·3708) in 
the standard-dose group (difference -0·0080, 95% CI -0·0160 to -0·0003). The 
high-dose vaccine provided a gain in QALYs (mean 8·1502 QALYs gained per 
participant [SD 0·5693]) compared with the standard-dose vaccine (8·1499 QALYs 
[0·5697]) and, due to cost savings, dominated standard-dose vaccine in the 
cost-utility analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the 
high-dose vaccine is 93% likely to be cost saving.
INTERPRETATION: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is a less 
costly and more effective alternative to the standard-dose vaccine, driven by a 
reduction in the number of hospital admissions. These findings are relevant to 
US health-care beneficiaries, providers, payers, and recommending bodies, 
especially those seeking to improve outcomes while containing costs.

BACKGROUND: Mechanized dry seeded rice can save both labour and water resources. 
Rice seedling establishment is sensitive to sowing depth while mesocotyl 
elongation facilitates the emergence of deeply sown seeds.
RESULTS: A set of 270 rice accessions, including 170 from the mini-core 
collection of Chinese rice germplasm (C Collection) and 100 varieties used in a 
breeding program for drought resistance (D Collection), was screened for 
mesocotyl lengths of seedlings grown in water (MLw) in darkness and in 5 cm sand 
culture (MLs). Twenty six accessions (10.53 %) have MLw longer than 1.0 cm. 
Eleven accessions had the highest mesocotyl lengths, i.e. 1.4 - 5.05 cm of MLw 
and 3.0 - 6.4 cm in 10 cm sand culture, including 7 upland landraces or 
varieties. The genotypic data of 1,019,883 SNPs were developed by re-sequencing 
of those accessions. A whole-genome SNP array (Rice SNP50) was used to genotype 
24 accessions as a validation panel, giving 98.41 % of consistent SNPs with the 
re-sequencing data in average. GWAS based on compressed mixed linear model was 
conducted using GAPIT. Based on a threshold of -log(P) ≥8.0, 13 loci were 
associated to MLw on rice chromosome 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, respectively. Three 
associated loci, on chromosome 3, 6, and 10, were detected for MLs. A set of 99 
associated SNPs for MLw, based on a compromised threshold (-log(P) ≥7.0), 
located in intergenic regions or different positions of 36 annotated genes, 
including one cullin and one growth regulating factor gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher proportion and extension of elongated mesocotyls were 
observed in the mini-core collection of rice germplasm and upland rice landraces 
or varieties, possibly causing the correlation between mesocotyl elongation and 
drought resistance. GWAS found 13 loci for mesocotyl length measured in dark 
germination that confirmed the previously reported co-location of two QTLs 
across populations and experiments. Associated SNPs hit 36 annotated genes 
including function-matching candidates like cullin and GRF. The germplasm with 
elongated mesocotyl, especially upland landraces or varieties, and the 
associated SNPs could be useful in further studies and breeding of mechanized 
dry seeded rice.

BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines advocate early antiretroviral therapy (ART) to 
decrease human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) morbidity and prevent transmission, 
but suboptimal engagement in care may compromise impact. We sought to determine 
the economic and epidemiologic impact of incomplete engagement in HIV care in 
the United States.
METHODS: We constructed a dynamic transmission model of HIV among US adults 
(aged 15-65 years) and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of improvements 
along the HIV care continuum : We evaluated enhanced HIV testing (annual for 
high-risk groups), increased 3-month linkage to care (to 90%), and improved 
retention (50% relative reduction in yearly disengagement and 50% increase in 
reengagement). Our primary outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Despite early ART initiation, a projected 1.39 million (95% uncertainty 
range [UR], 0.91-2.2 million) new HIV infections will occur at a (discounted) 
cost of $256 billion ($199-298 billion) over 2 decades at existing levels of HIV 
care engagement. Enhanced testing with increased linkage has modest 
epidemiologic benefits and could reduce incident HIV infections by 21% (95% UR, 
13%-26%) at a cost of $65 700 per QALY gained ($44 500-111 000). By contrast, 
comprehensive improvements that couples enhanced testing and linkage with 
improved retention would reduce HIV incidence by 54% (95% UR, 37%-68%) and 
mortality rate by 64% (46%-78%), at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $45 300 per 
QALY gained ($27 800-72 300).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to improve engagement in HIV care in the United States 
leads to excess infections, treatment costs, and deaths. Interventions that 
improve not just HIV screening but also retention in care are needed to optimize 
epidemiologic impact and cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at investigating the clinical features and 
outcomes of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients younger than 40 years, which have 
not been extensively investigated yet.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-five patients younger than 40 years 
were retrospectively studied from a series of 1002 FL patients diagnosed in four 
different European Oncology Centres (Barcelona, Spain; Bellinzona, Switzerland; 
London, UK; Novara, Italy) from 1985 to 2010.
RESULTS: Patients younger than 40 had a lower incidence of elevated LDH, high 
beta2-microglobulin, and a high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International 
Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, whereas bone marrow involvement and bulky and 
disseminated lymphadenopathy were more frequent. At a median follow-up of 10 
years, younger patients, in comparison with those older than 40, had 
significantly better overall (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and 
progression-free survival (PFS), with 10-year OS rate of 81% versus 51% (P < 
0.0001), 10-year CSS rate of 82% versus 60% (P < 0.0001), and 10-year PFS of 39% 
versus 24% (P = 0.0098). However, there were no significant CSS and PFS 
differences in comparison with the patients aged 40-60. In multivariate 
analysis, having the lymphoma diagnosed in the last two decades and a favourable 
FLIPI score were associated with a significantly longer PFS and CSS in younger 
patients, whereas only FLIPI retained statistical significance for OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, FL patients younger than 40 have a median OS of 24 
years and their outcome seems to be improving over time. However, they still 
have a significantly shorter life expectancy than that of an age-matched general 
healthy population.

At the end of 2013, 35 million people worldwide were infected with HIV. The 
prognosis of HIV has been transformed by combination antiretroviral therapy 
(cART). Providing compliance is good, the use of cART has normalised the life 
expectancy of HIV-infected people leading to a growing population of people with 
chronic infection. Management of HIV patients has therefore needed to adapt in 
order to not only control viral activity but also manage long-term complications 
of HIV and cART. Rheumatological manifestations of HIV were first described in 
1989. Since then, there have been case reports, case series and epidemiological 
studies describing different clinical manifestations of HIV in the 
musculoskeletal system. This review will encompass musculoskeletal pain, 
fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inflammatory arthritis in 
HIV. We will aim to report on the prevalence of these conditions and the risk 
factors, explore the impact of the virus on the clinical presentations and 
discuss implications for diagnosis and management.

BACKGROUND: The role of locoregional treatment in women with metastatic breast 
cancer at first presentation is unclear. Preclinical evidence suggests that such 
treatment might help the growth of metastatic disease, whereas many 
retrospective analyses in clinical cohorts have suggested a favourable effect of 
locoregional treatment in these patients. We aimed to compare the effect of 
locoregional treatment with no treatment on outcome in women with metastatic 
breast cancer at initial presentation.
METHODS: In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
previously untreated patients (≤65 years of age with an estimated remaining life 
expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer 
from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast tumour and 
axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a computer-generated 
block randomisation sequence (block size of four). Randomisation was stratified 
by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic lesions, and hormone 
receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in the breast that 
could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned upfront, whereas 
those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for chemotherapy before 
randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before randomisation, we 
randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response after six to 
eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed 
by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT00193778.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013, of the 716 women presenting 
with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly assigned 350 patients: 173 to 
locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional treatment. At data cut-off of 
Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR 12·2-38·7) with 235 deaths 
(locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional treatment n=117). Median overall 
survival was 19·2 months (95% CI 15·98-22·46) in the locoregional treatment 
group and 20·5 months (16·96-23·98) in the no-locoregional treatment group (HR 
1·04, 95% CI 0·81-1·34; p=0·79), and the corresponding 2-year overall survival 
was 41·9% (95% CI 33·9-49·7) in the locoregional treatment group and 43·0% 
(35·2-50·8) in the no locoregional treatment group. The only adverse event noted 
was wound infection related to surgery in one patient in the locoregional 
treatment group.
INTERPRETATION: There is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of 
the primary tumour affects overall survival in patients with metastatic breast 
cancer at initial presentation who have responded to front-line chemotherapy, 
and this procedure should not be part of routine practice.

BACKGROUND: In recent decades, advances in surgery and therapeutic 
catheterization have steadily increased the life expectancy and prevalence of 
adults with congenital heart disease (CHD).
AIMS: We assessed medical and psychosocial variables of adults with CHD, 
according to the disease complexity.
METHODS: We included, from a single-centre observational cohort study, 135 
consecutive adults with CHD (median age of 40 years, interquartile range: 
28.0-51.0) followed in our cardiology unit, who answered a questionnaire 
assessing daily activity and psychosocial functioning. Disease complexity was 
classified according to the Bethesda conference.
RESULTS: Cardiac malformation complexity was simple in 61 (45.2%), moderate in 
50 (37.0%) and complex in 24 (17.8%) patients. Cardiac surgery had been 
performed in 86.5% of moderate and complex patients. Complications (such as 
heart failure, arrhythmia and pulmonary hypertension) were mainly observed in 
the complex group (P=0.003). Physical activity was lower in the complex group 
(no activity in 58.8%, but sport previously contraindicated in 50% of these; 
P=0.03). Education level tended to be lower in the complex and moderate groups 
than in the simple group (respectively, 31.2% and 33.3% vs. 45.7% had passed the 
Baccalaureate; P=0.47). The pass rate was lower in patients with complications 
(P=0.037) or more than one cardiac surgery (P=0.03). In the complex group, 56.3% 
of patients were unemployed (P=0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Complexity of heart disease and medical history affect education 
level and employment of adults with CHD. Academic education of children with a 
complex defect and career counselling are important to prevent unemployment 
among adults with CHD.

Antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved the life expectancy in 
HIV-infected people, but it cannot cure the disease by itself. Several barriers 
have been identified for the cure of HIV infection, including a reservoir of 
latently infected cells, persistent viral replication in tissues, and anatomical 
sanctuaries. The main strategy proposed for the cure of HIV consists on the 
administration of drugs that, through the reactivation of latent HIV, would 
eliminate the cell reservoir. Ongoing clinical trials have shown the proof of 
concept, but the efficacy of these drugs in decreasing the reservoir size has 
not been proved so far.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and 
function. It is a common finding in older patients and is associated with 
decreased life expectancy and potentially higher susceptibility to chemotherapy 
toxicity. This study describes the prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults with 
early stage colorectal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients ≥70 years old who underwent surgical resection 
for stage I-III colorectal cancer between 2008 and 2013 were identified from the 
medical record. Sarcopenia was assessed by measuring the total muscle area on 
computerized tomography (CT) images obtained prior to surgery. Total muscle area 
was measured at the level of L3 and normalized using each patient's height to 
produce a skeletal muscle index (SMI). Sarcopenia was defined using sex- and 
body mass index (BMI)-specific threshold values of SMI.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included, with a median age of 77 years 
(70-96). Twenty-five men (60% of 42) and 25 women (56% of 45) had sarcopenia. 
Sarcopenic patients had significantly lower BMI (p=0.03) compared to 
non-sarcopenic patients. There was a positive correlation between BMI and SMI 
for both men (r=0.44) and women (r=0.16).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent among older patients with early stage 
colorectal cancer. BMI alone is a poor indicator of lean body mass and improved 
methods of screening for sarcopenia are necessary. CT scans are a viable option 
for identifying sarcopenic patients in whom timely interventions may improve 
survival, quality of life, and functional outcomes.

We have constructed a formal model on cost-benefit of new technology in health 
care, and apply it on boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). We assume that the 
patient health benefit from getting cured in acute treatment is always higher 
than the patient utility resulting from any long term treatment or death. This 
assumption makes it possible to evaluate the monetary cost impacts of a new 
technology and relate these measures to the patient health benefit.

Average adult height is a physical measure of the biological standard of living 
of a population. While the biological and economic standards of living of a 
population are very different concepts, they are linked and may empirically move 
together. If this is so, then cohort heights can also be used to make inferences 
about the economic standard of living and health of a population when other data 
are not available. We investigate how informative this approach is in terms of 
inferring income, nutrition, and mortality using data on heights from developing 
countries over the last 50 years for female cohorts born 1951-1992. We find no 
evidence that the absolute differences in adult height across countries are 
associated with different economic living standards. Within countries, however, 
faster increases in adult cohort height over time are associated with more rapid 
growth of GDP per capita, life expectancy, and nutritional intake. Using our 
instrumental variable approach, each centimeter gain in height is associated 
with a 6% increase in income per capita, a reduction in infant mortality of 7 
per thousand (or an 1.25 year increase in life expectancy), and an increase in 
nutrition of 64 calories and 2 grams of protein per person per day relative to 
the global trend. We find that increases in cohort height can predict increases 
in income even for countries not used in the estimation of the relationship. 
This suggests our approach has predictive power out of sample for countries 
where we lack income and health data.
