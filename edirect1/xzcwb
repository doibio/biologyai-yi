wild-type mice, AppNL-F/wt knock-in mice, and ob/ob mice. Notably, the Aβ42 
levels were increased at minimum levels before deposition in AppNL-F/wt knock-in 
mice and AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice at 18 months of age. No differences in 
the levels of several neuronal markers were observed between mice at this age. 
However, we observed increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
an astrocyte marker, in AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice, while the levels of 
several microglial markers, including CD11b, TREM2, and DAP12, were decreased in 
both ob/ob mice and AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice. The increase in GFAP levels 
was not observed in young AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice. Thus, the increased 
Aβ42 levels may decrease the lifespan of ob/ob mice, which is associated with 
the dysregulation of microglia and astrocytes in an age-dependent manner. Based 
on these findings, the imbalance in these neuroinflammatory cells may provide a 
clue to the mechanisms by which the interaction between obesity/diabetes and 
early AD reduces life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the expectation of normal life expectancy for thyroid cancer, 
there are concerns about the decreased quality of life (QoL). The present study 
investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in QoL scores in 
thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 286 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid 
cancer after thyroidectomy were involved in this prospective, single-center, 
observational study from November 2018 to June 2019. The European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 was 
used to assess the QoL 3 months after thyroidectomy. We investigated the effects 
of demographics (age, gender, education, marital status, area of residence, and 
annual mean income), tumor characteristics (histology, clinical stage, presence 
of metastasis, surgery type, and radiotherapy), and neurological deficits 
induced by recurrent nerve or superior laryngeal injury on QoL.
RESULTS: The mean overall QoL in thyroid cancer survivors was 65.93 ±9.00 (on a 
scale of 0-100, where 100 was the best). Multivariate regression analysis 
confirmed that clinical stage (P < 0.010), surgery type (P < 0.001), histology 
(P < 0.001), neurological deficits (P < 0.001), and marital status (P < 0.001) 
were independent risk factors for decreased QoL 3 months after thyroidectomy.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that clinical stage, surgery type, histology, 
neurological deficits, and marital status were independent risk factors for 
decreased QoL at 3 months after thyroidectomy. Further exploration and 
validation of these findings in larger prospective studies are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is one of the most common blood abnormalities in people with 
HIV. The incidence of anemia ranges from 10% in people who have no HIV symptoms 
to 92% among individuals who have advanced AIDS. Anemia which is also one of the 
major challenges among HIV patients can lead to impaired physical functioning, 
psychological distress, poor quality of life, accelerated disease progression, 
and shorter life expectancy. There are different reports that show a large 
number of patients with both anemia and HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia. However, the 
burden of anemia among those HIV/AIDS patients receiving ART is not fully 
understood in Gedeo zone health institutions. Hence, this study is designed to 
assess the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among adult HIV/AIDS 
clients receiving ART at Gedeo zone health institutions, SNNPR, Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gedeo zone 
health institutions from November 21 2017 to January 30, 2018. The systematic 
random sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants. The 
hematocrit level was used to determine anemic status. Data were entered into EPI 
info version 7 and transferred to STATA version 12.0 for analysis. In order to 
identify factors associated with anemia, a multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was employed.
RESULT: A total of 422 patients were included with a mean age of 33.85 (SD = ±9. 
12) years. The prevalence of anemia was 34.8% (95% CI 30.1-39.8), while about 
7.4%, 14.3%, and 13.1% of the patients had severe, moderate, and mild anemia, 
respectively. The mean hemoglobin was 14.6 (SD=±10. 8), (95% CI 13.6_15.8). 
INH/Isoniazid prophylaxis (OR =1.8 [95% CI: 1.1, 2.9]) and bedridden functional 
status (OR =5.48 [95% CI: 1.25, 23.8]) were determinants of anemia in this 
study.
CONCLUSION: In this study, a large number of pateients had anemia (34.8%) with 
the majority of them having a moderate form. Functional status and using INH 
prophylaxis were determinant factors of anemia.

An increasing number of patients are being referred to pancreatic centres around 
the world due to often incidentally discovered cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. 
The evaluation and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms is a controversial 
topic and with existing guidelines based on a lack of strong evidence there is 
discordance between centres and guidelines with regard to when to offer surgery 
and when to favour surveillance. The frequency, duration and modality of 
surveillance is also controversial as this is resource-consuming and must be 
balanced against the perceived benefits and risks involved. While there is 
consensus that the risk of malignancy should be balanced against the 
life-expectancy and comorbidities, the indications for surgery and surveillance 
strategies vary among the guidelines. Thus, the tug of war between surveillance 
or resection continues. Here we discuss the recommendations from guidelines with 
further accumulating data and emerging reports on intraductal papillary mucinous 
neoplasm in the literature.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care patients, those suffering from at least one chronic 
lifelong medical condition and hospice care patients, those with a life 
expectancy less than 6 months, are regularly hospitalised in general internal 
medicine wards. By means of a clinical case, this review aims to equip the 
internist with an approach to bleeding in this population. Firstly, practical 
advice on platelet transfusions will be provided. Secondly, the management of 
bleeding in site-specific situations will be addressed (from the ENT/pulmonary 
sphere, gastrointestinal - urogenital tract and cutaneous ulcers). Finally, an 
algorithm pertaining to the management of catastrophic bleeding is proposed.
METHODS: Electronic databases, including EMBASE, Pubmed, Google Scholar and the 
Cochrane Library were studied as primary resources, in association with local 
guidelines, to identify papers exploring platelet transfusions and alternative 
management of site-specific bleeding in palliative care patients.
RESULTS: Haemorrhagic complications are frequent in palliative care patients in 
the internal medicine ward. Current guidelines propose a therapeutic-only 
platelet transfusion policy. Nonetheless, prophylactic and/or therapeutic 
transfusion remains a physician-dependent decision. Site-specific therapeutic 
options are based on expert opinion and case reports. While invasive measures 
may be pertinent in certain situations, their application must be compatible 
with patient goals. Catastrophic bleeding requires caregivers' comforting 
presence; pharmacological management is secondary.
CONCLUSION: Literature is lacking regarding management of bleeding in the 
palliative care population hospitalised in an acute medical setting. 
Recommendations are of limited quality, the majority based on case reports or 
expert opinion. Further studies, exploring for example the impact on patient 
quality of life, are desirable to improve the management of this frequently 
encountered complication.

BACKGROUND: The Los Angeles County (LAC) Division of HIV and STD Programs 
implemented a medical care coordination (MCC) program to address the medical and 
psychosocial service needs of people with HIV (PWH) at risk for poor health 
outcomes.
METHODS: Our objective was to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the 
MCC program. Using the CEPAC-US model populated with clinical characteristics 
and costs observed from the MCC program, we projected lifetime clinical and 
economic outcomes for a cohort of high-risk PWH under 2 strategies: (1) No MCC 
and (2) a 2-year MCC program. The cohort was stratified by acuity using social 
and clinical characteristics. Baseline viral suppression was 33% in both 
strategies; 2-year suppression was 33% with No MCC and 57% with MCC. The program 
cost $2700/person/year. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life 
expectancy, lifetime medical costs, and cost-effectiveness. The 
cost-effectiveness threshold for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
was $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: With MCC, life expectancy increased from 10.07 to 10.94 QALYs, and 
costs increased from $311 300 to $335 100 compared with No MCC (ICER, $27 
400/QALY). ICERs for high/severe, moderate, and low acuity were $30 500/QALY, 
$25 200/QALY, and $77 400/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, MCC remained 
cost-effective if 2-year viral suppression was ≥39% even if MCC costs increased 
3-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: The LAC MCC program improved survival and was cost-effective. 
Similar programs should be considered in other settings to improve outcomes for 
high-risk PWH.

BACKGROUND: Surgery is the preferred option for patients with symptomatic 
localized fibrostenotic ileocecal Crohn's disease (CD) but not for those with 
predominantly active inflammation without obstruction. The benefit of early 
surgery in patients with a limited nonstricturing ileocecal CD over biologic 
treatment is still a debate.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to formulate a decision analysis model based on 
recently published data to explore whether early surgery in patients with 
limited nonstricturing CD is preferred over biologic treatment.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model comparing 2 strategies of treatment: (1) 
early surgery vs (2) biologic treatment. To estimate the quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and the costs in each strategy, we simulated 10,000 virtual 
patients with the Markov model using a Monte Carlo simulation 100 times. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model and 
address uncertainties in the estimation of model parameters.
RESULTS: The costs were $29,457 ± $407 and $50,382 ± $525 (mean ± SD) for early 
surgery strategy and biologic treatment strategy, respectively. The QALY was 
6.24 ± 0.01 and 5.81 ± 0.01 for early surgery strategy and biologic treatment 
strategy, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The strategy of early surgery dominates (higher QALY value 
[efficacy] and less cost) compared with the strategy of biologic treatment in 
patients with limited ileocecal CD.

With the advent of immunotherapy, the life expectancy of patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is dramatically improved. As described in the 
most recent clinical trials, the addition of immunotherapy to the available 
therapeutic strategies, restoring an efficient immune response against neoplasms 
and establishing an immunological memory, is able to improve both patient's 
survival and quality of life. This paved the way for new therapeutic algorithms, 
new combination strategies, as well as the possible use of adoptive 
immunotherapy. Although the use of immunotherapy is now widely employed in the 
different phases of lung cancer, we have not yet fully understood what are both 
the actual mechanisms of action and resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, 
predictive factors of response, immuno-related response criteria, and 
interferences between immunotherapy and tumor microenvironment, as well as 
angiogenesis and its interactions with conventional therapies, such as 
chemotherapy. The objective of this critical review is to frame the relevant 
results obtained with immunotherapy in NSCLC, providing insights to help 
overcome decision-making for a better therapeutic choice. In addition, returning 
to the study of pulmonary physiology and preclinical data, we will address the 
new issues on the heterogeneity of response to anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1, including 
their combinations, in NSCLC. Moreover, to date, we are facing with patterns of 
response different from those previously seen with cytotoxic or target 
therapies. Indeed, different radiological evaluation criteria have been proposed 
to evaluate response to immunotherapy and further efforts are needed to identify 
a unique system of evaluation and other than PDL1 biomarkers, to integrate 
radiology in the assessment of response.

Regressive models for risk prediction of repeated multinomial outcomes: An 
illustration using Health and Retirement Study data.

Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Life expectancy is increasing in many countries and this may lead to a higher 
frequency of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, there is a growing demand for 
predicting the risk of a sequence of events based on specified factors from 
repeated outcomes. We proposed regressive models and a framework to predict the 
joint probabilities of a sequence of events for multinomial outcomes from 
longitudinal studies. The Markov chain is used to link marginal and sequence of 
conditional probabilities to predict the joint probability. Marginal and 
sequence of conditional probabilities are estimated using marginal and 
regressive models. An application is shown using the Health and Retirement Study 
data. The bias of parameter estimates for all models from all bootstrap 
simulation is less than 1% in most of the cases. The estimated mean squared 
error is also very low. Results from the simulation study show negligible bias 
and the usefulness of the proposed model. The proposed model and framework would 
be useful to solve real-life problems from various fields and big data analysis.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary, 
auto-inflammatory disease, characterised by recurrent, self-limiting attacks of 
fever with inflammation of the serosal membranes, joints, and skin. Chronic 
inflammation was previously associated with increased risk for ischaemic heart 
disease (IHD). However, the association between FMF and IHD remains unclear. The 
objective of this study is to determine whether this association exists.
METHODS: Utilising the database of the largest health-care provider in Israel, a 
cross-sectional study was performed. The incidence of IHD was compared between 
patients diagnosed with FMF and age and sex-matched controls. Chi-square and 
t-test were used for categorial and continuous variables, and cox logistics 
regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Survival analysis was made 
using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test.
RESULTS: The study included 7670 patients diagnosed with FMF and an equal number 
of controls without FMF. In a univariate analysis FMF was found to be associated 
with higher prevalence of IHD (OR 1.33) and increased mortality (OR 1.29). In a 
multivariate analysis FMF was found to be independently associated with 
increased risk for IHD (OR 1.44).
CONCLUSION: The study shows that FMF is associated with both increased risk for 
IHD and higher mortality rates. An early diagnosis and treatment of this disease 
can potentially improve patients' life expectancy and decrease cardiac 
comorbidities.

Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to have a role in the 
development and course of Graves' disease (GD). Muscle weakness and quality of 
life (QoL) impairments are shared features of GD and vitamin D deficiency. We 
aimed at investigating whether vitamin D supplementation would improve 
restoration of muscle performance and thyroid-related QoL in GD and at 
describing the effect of anti-thyroid medication (ATD) on these outcomes. 
Methods: In a double-blinded clinical trial, hyperthyroid patients with a 
first-time diagnosis of GD were randomized to vitamin D 70 μg (2800 IU)/day or 
matching placebo as add-on to standard ATD. At baseline and after 3 and 9 months 
of intervention, we assessed isometric muscle strength, muscle function tests, 
postural stability, body composition, and QoL-impairment by using the ThyPRO 
questionnaire. Linear mixed modeling was used to analyze between-group 
differences. (The DAGMAR study clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT02384668). Results: Nine 
months of vitamin D supplementation caused an attenuation of muscle strength 
increment in all muscle measures investigated, significant at knee extension 60° 
where the increase was 24% lower (p = 0.04) in the vitamin D group compared with 
placebo. Compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation tended to reduce gain 
of lean body mass (-24%, p = 0.08). Vitamin D supplementation significantly 
impeded alleviation of Composite QoL and the same trend was observed for the 
Overall QoL-Impact and Impaired Daily Life scales. In response to ATD, all 
measures improved significantly. The increase in muscle strength ranged from 25% 
to 40% (pall < 0.001), and increment of lean body mass was 10% (p < 0.001). 
Large changes were observed in all QoL scales. Conclusions: Nine months of 
vitamin D supplementation caused unfavorable effects on restoration of muscle 
performance. In contrast, ATD treatment was associated with marked improvement 
in all measures of muscle performance and thyroid-related QoL. In patients with 
newly diagnosed GD, high-dose vitamin D supplementation should not be 
recommended to improve muscle function, but ATD is of major importance to 
alleviate muscle impairment.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to examine the effects of 
transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES) in a group of elderly 
women with presbyphonia.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized study.
METHODS: Fourteen participants were enrolled prospectively and attributed 
randomly to two different treatment groups, where one group (n = 7) received 
8 weeks of training (5 days a week), whereas the other group (n = 7) received 
4 weeks of ineffective stimulation, followed by 4 weeks of effective training. 
Stimulation protocols were established during baseline examination and confirmed 
with endoscopy to ensure a glottal reaction. Numerous acoustical, vocal, 
patient-centered, and respiratory parameters were obtained at several time 
points.
RESULTS: Neither 4 weeks nor 8 weeks of functional electrical transcutaneous 
stimulation led to changes of vocal, acoustical, or respiratory parameters, 
apart from patient-centered items (Voice Handicap Index 12, Voice-Related 
Quality of Life), which improved over time. However, there were no differences 
between the two arms for both items.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcutaneous FES over 4 weeks and 8 weeks did not lead to 
significantly improved objective voice and acoustical parameters, which could be 
caused by the fact that the muscles of interest cannot be targeted specifically 
enough. However, we found a significant improvement of subjective voice 
perception and voice-related quality of life in both groups. We explain this 
finding with an observer-expectancy effect secondary to the very time-consuming 
and elaborate study procedures.

MARCH5 is a RING finger E3 ligase involved in mitochondrial integrity, cellular 
protein homeostasis, and the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission. To 
determine the function of MARCH5 during development, we assessed transcript 
expression in zebrafish embryos. We found that march5 transcripts were of 
maternal origin and evenly distributed at the 1-cell stage, except for the 
mid-blastula transition, with expression predominantly in the developing central 
nervous system at later stages of embryogenesis. Overexpression of march5 
impaired convergent extension movement during gastrulation, resulting in reduced 
patterning along the dorsoventral axis and alterations in the ventral cell 
types. Overexpression and knockdown of march5 disrupted the organization of the 
developing telencephalon and diencephalon. Lastly, we found that the 
transcription of march5 was tightly regulated by the transcriptional regulators 
CHOP, C/EBPα, Staf, Znf143a, and Znf76. These results demonstrate the essential 
role of March5 in the development of zebrafish embryos.

BACKGROUND: Although there is solid evidence that active cigarette-smoking 
interplays with asthma, no recent information has been published on the 
worldwide burden of smoking-related asthma.
METHODS: An electronic search was carried out in the Global Health Data Exchange 
(GHDx) registry, using the keywords "asthma" and "smoking." Asthma-related 
population burden was expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Although smoking-related DALYs for asthma has consistently declined by 
approximately 20% over the last 3 decades, the burden remains high, accounting 
for 9.3% of the cumulative 22.8 million DALYs caused by asthma around the world. 
Across all ages, the burden of smoking-related DALYs for asthma is greater in 
men than in women and reaches a peak in both sexes at the age of 55-70 years. 
Europe is the continent with the greatest burden of smoking-related DALYs for 
asthma, followed by western Pacific nations and Southeast Asia, whilst the least 
burden is seen in Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: The specific asthmatic populations identified with our search shall 
be specifically targeted with health care policies aimed at decreasing the 
impact of cigarette-smoking on their asthma condition and thereby contributing 
to lower the clinical, societal, and economic burden of smoking-related asthma.

Moving Toward Health Equity by Addressing Social Determinants of Health.

Lathrop B.

Social determinants of health-the conditions in which people are born, grow, 
work, live, and age that affect health and quality of life-are strongly 
associated with disparities in health status and life expectancy. Nurses require 
a comprehensive understanding of social determinants and their associations with 
health outcomes to provide patient-centered care. Nurses can be leaders and 
change agents in advancing health equity by screening for social determinants 
that affect women and by engaging in cross-sector collaboration to build 
partnerships outside the health care system to address complex social needs. 
Nurses can also use their experience and knowledge to advocate for system-level 
change, which is required to address the upstream factors influencing the health 
of women.

The (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproduct [(6-4)PP] is a major DNA lesion 
induced by ultraviolet radiation. (6-4)PP induces complex mutations opposite its 
downstream bases, in addition to opposite 3' or 5' base, as has been observed 
through a site-specific translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) assay. The mechanism by 
which these mutations occur is not well understood. To elucidate the mechanisms 
underlying mutagenesis induced by (6-4)PP, we performed an intracellular TLS 
assay using a replicative vector with site-specific T(thymidine)-T (6-4)PP. 
Rev3-/-p53-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (defective in Polζ) were 
almost completely defective in bypassing T-T (6-4)PP, whereas both Rev1-/- and 
Polh-/-Poli-/-Polk-/- MEF cells (defective in Polη, Polι, and Polκ) presented 
bypassing activity comparable to that of wild-type cells, indicating that 
Y-family TLS polymerases are dispensable for bypassing activity, whereas Polζ 
plays an essential role, probably at the extension step. Among all cells tested, 
misincorporation occurred most frequently just beyond the lesion (position +1), 
indicating that the Polζ-dependent extension step is crucial for (6-4)PP-induced 
mutagenesis. We then examined the effects of sequence context on T-T (6-4)PP 
bypass using a series of T-T (6-4)PP templates with different sequences at 
position +1 or -1 to the lesion, and found that the dependency of T-T (6-4)PP 
bypass on Polζ is not sequence specific. However, the misincorporation frequency 
at position +1 differed significantly among these templates. The 
misincorporation of A at position +1 occurred frequently when a purine base was 
located at position -1. These results indicate that Polζ-dependent extension 
plays a major role in inducing base substitutions in (6-4)PP-induced 
mutagenesis, and its fidelity is affected by sequence context surrounding a 
lesion.

BACKGROUND: Permanent pacing is the therapy of choice for treating severe and/or 
symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. The number of very elderly patients receiving 
pacemakers is increasing and little is known about survival in this specific 
subgroup. This study is aimed at assessing the actual survival of patients 
requiring pacing therapy at age > 85 years and investigating variables 
associated with death.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2017, 572 patients aged ≥ 85 years underwent pacemaker 
implantation for conventional bradycardia indications in Department of 
Cardiology, S. Chiara Hospital, Italy.
RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients were ≥ 90-year-old and comorbidities were 
frequent. Fifty-seven percent of patients required pacing for prognostic reasons 
(acquired atrioventricular block), and the remaining for relief of bradycardia 
symptoms. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted in 34% of patients. The 5-year 
survival was 45% (standard error: 3%), and the 8-year survival was 26% (standard 
error: 4%). The risk of death was similar in patients who received pacemaker for 
symptom relief and for prognostic reasons in the overall population (HR = 1.19, 
95% CI: 0.93-1.52, P = 0.156), as well as in the ≥ 90-year-old group (HR = 1.39, 
95% CI: 0.92-2.11, P = 0.102). At multivariate analysis, following variables 
were associated with death: higher age, lower ejection fraction, 
dementia/dysautonomia and diagnosis of cancer. The pacing indication and the 
implantation of a single chamber pacemaker were not associated with worse 
prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a good life expectancy in patients aged ≥ 85 
years who received a pacemaker. Strong risk factors for all-cause death were 
non-cardiac. Pacemaker therapy seems a clinically effective therapeutic option 
to improve survival and to control bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms in very 
elderly patients.

Osseointegrated Prosthetic Implants for People With Lower-Limb Amputation: A 
Health Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Sehatzadeh S, Tiggelaar S, Shafique A, Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Osseointegrated prosthetic implants are biocompatible metal devices 
that are inserted into the residual bone to integrate with the bone and attach 
to the external prosthesis, eliminating the need for socket prostheses and the 
problems that may accompany their use. We conducted a health technology 
assessment of osseointegrated prosthetic implants, compared with conventional 
socket prostheses, for people with lower-limb amputation who experience chronic 
problems with their prosthetic socket, leading to prosthesis intolerance and 
reduced mobility. Our analysis included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, 
cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding osseointegrated 
prosthetic implants, and patient preferences and values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence on 
the safety and effectiveness of the latest iterations of three implant systems: 
the Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees (OPRA) Implant 
System, the Endo-Exo-Femur-Prosthesis, and the Osseointegration Group of 
Australia-Osseointegration Prosthetic Limb (OGAP-OPL). We assessed the risk of 
bias of individual studies and determined the quality of the body of evidence 
according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic 
literature search and conducted a cost-utility analysis with a lifetime horizon 
from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the net budget impact of 
publicly funding osseointegrated prosthetic implants in Ontario. To 
contextualize the potential value of osseointegrated prosthetic implants, we 
spoke with people with lower-limb amputations.
RESULTS: We included nine studies in the clinical evidence review. All studies 
included patients with above-the-knee amputation who underwent two-stage surgery 
and mostly had short-term follow-up. With osseointegrated prosthetic implants, 
scores for functional outcomes improved significantly as measured by 6-Minute 
Walk Test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and Questionnaire for Persons with 
a Transfemoral Amputation (Q-TFA). The scores for quality of life measured by 
SF-36 showed significant improvement in the physical component summary but a 
nonsignificant decline for the mental component summary. The most frequently 
seen adverse event was superficial infection, occurring in about half of 
patients in some studies. Deep or bone infection was a serious adverse event, 
with variable rates among the studies depending on the length of follow-up. The 
treatment of deep or bone infection required long-term antibiotic use, surgical 
debridement, revision surgery, and implant extraction in some cases. Other 
adverse events included femoral bone fracture, implant breakage, issues with 
extramedullary parts that required replacement, and implant removal. Our 
assessment of the quality of the clinical evidence according to the GRADE 
criteria found low certainty in terms of improvement in functional outcomes, low 
certainty for quality of life, and high certainty of an increase in adverse 
events; all findings compared receiving an osseointegrated prosthetic implant 
with not receiving an osseointegrated prosthetic implant.In our economic model, 
osseointegrated prosthetic implants were found to be more effective and more 
expensive than having people remain users of an uncomfortable socket prosthesis. 
Our best estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
osseointegration, compared with an uncomfortable socket, was $94,987 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The probability of osseointegration 
being cost-effective was 54.2% at a willingness-to-pay value of $100,000 per 
QALY gained. The annual net budget impact of publicly funding osseointegrated 
prosthetic implants in Ontario over the next 5 years, for a small population of 
eligible candidates, would range from $1.5 million in year 1 to $0.6 million in 
year 5, for a 5-year total of $5.3 million.We interviewed 13 people with a 
lower-limb amputation; nine had experience with both a conventional socket 
prosthesis and an osseointegrated prosthetic implant, three had experience with 
a conventional socket prosthesis only, and one had only recently undergone 
amputation and had not yet chosen a prosthesis. People who had received an 
osseointegrated prosthetic implant said they had better mobility and quality of 
life than before receiving this implant but had concerns about the ongoing risk 
of infection and potential for problems with implant maintenance. People using a 
conventional socket prosthesis said cost was the only factor preventing them 
from undergoing an osseointegration procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: In the studies included in the clinical evidence review, most 
people who received osseointegrated prosthetic implants were followed for only a 
few years. Studies showed that functional outcomes and physical ability improved 
with osseointegrated prosthetic implants (GRADE: Low), but there was uncertainty 
about the impact of these implants on people's emotional health (GRADE: Low). 
Osseointegrated prosthetic implants can lead to serious adverse events such as 
bone infection and bone fracture in some patients, which may require additional 
surgeries (GRADE: High). The reference case of the primary economic evaluation 
represented a conservative estimate of cost-effectiveness and found 
osseointegration may be cost-effective, but there is a large degree of 
uncertainty given parameter uncertainty and the need to use proxy costs. 
Scenario analyses explored potential variations in approaches to modelling and 
parameter selection. Qualitative interviews with people with a lower-limb 
amputation and caregivers underscored the challenges of conventional socket 
prostheses, but cost remains an important barrier to pursuing osseointegrated 
prosthetic implantation.

Longevity is dictated by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. One 
of the key mechanisms to regulate life-span extension is the induction of 
protein chaperones for protein homeostasis. Ectopic activation of the unfolded 
protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER) specifically in neurons is 
sufficient to enhance organismal stress resistance and extend life span. Here, 
we find that this activation not only promotes chaperones but also facilitates 
ER restructuring and ER function. This restructuring is concomitant with lipid 
depletion through lipophagy. Activation of lipophagy is distinct from chaperone 
induction and is required for the life-span extension found in this paradigm. 
Last, we find that overexpression of the lipophagy component, ehbp-1, is 
sufficient to deplete lipids, remodel ER, and promote life span. Therefore, UPR 
induction in neurons triggers two distinct programs in the periphery: the 
proteostasis arm through protein chaperones and metabolic changes through lipid 
depletion mediated by EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP-1).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a French value set for the 
EQ-5D-5L, for academic and clinical research, and for regulatory requirements 
for price-setting of drugs and medical devices.
METHOD: This study used the standardized valuation protocol developed by 
EuroQol, using computer-assisted personal interview software. A representative 
sample of 1048 French residents were interviewed by a market research company, 
under the supervision of the research team. Health states were valued using 
composite time trade-off and a discrete choice experiment. Modeling was used to 
create values for the 3125 possible health states. The composite time trade-off 
data were modeled using a Tobit model with censored observations at -1 and 
correcting for heteroscedasticity. A conditional logit model was used for the 
discrete choice results, and both models were combined using a hybrid model. An 
adjusted hybrid model was tested to correct for imbalance in the sample on age 
and sex compared with the general population. A comparison with the 3-level (3L) 
value set was performed.
RESULTS: The adjusted model was preferred to comply with the representativeness 
of the general population. It provided a value set for which all coefficients 
were logically consistent. Values ranged from - 0.525 to 1. The distribution of 
values presented a shift towards higher values versus the 3L value set. Ranking 
of dimensions changed. Pain and discomfort and mobility were the dimensions with 
the highest potential for disutility compared with mobility and self-care for 
the 3L instrument.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a value set based on societal preferences of 
the French population, using an improved descriptive instrument of 
health-related quality-of-life health states. It will contribute to improve the 
quality of cost-effectiveness analysis in the French context and help stimulate 
disease-specific quality-of-life references for academic-, institutional-, and 
industry-promoted studies.
