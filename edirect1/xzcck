characteristics perceived to promote unhealthy eating and inactivity. This 
approach leveraged Extension's mission, which includes connecting rural 
communities with land-grant university resources.
OBJECTIVES: HEAL MAPPS™ (Healthy Eating Active Living Mapping Attributes using 
Participatory Photographic Surveys) was developed as a participatory action 
research methodology. Adopted by Extension community partners, HEAL MAPPS™ 
involved residents in photomapping, characterizing, and communicating lived 
experiences of their rural community, and prioritizing interventions to change 
the obesogenic context.
METHODS: Extension educators serving rural communities in six Western U.S. 
states were trained to implement HEAL MAPPS™. Extension engaged community 
members who mapped and evaluated their encounters with environmental attributes 
that shape their dietary and activity patterns. The method partnered residents 
with decision makers in identifying issues, assessing resources and readiness, 
and prioritizing locally relevant environmental strategies to reduce access 
disparities for rural populations with high obesity risk.
CONCLUSIONS: HEAL MAPPS™ revealed differences in resource availability, 
accessibility, and affordability within and among rural communities, as well as 
in readiness to address the obesogenic context. Extension functioned 
successfully as the backbone organization, and local community health partner, 
cooperatively implementing HEAL MAPPS™ and engaging constituents in shaping 
weight healthy environments.

The Complicated Relationship of Disability and Well-Being.

Campbell SM, Stramondo JA.

It is widely assumed that disability is typically a bad thing for those who are 
disabled. Our purpose in this essay is to critique this view and defend a more 
nuanced picture of the relationship between disability and well-being. We first 
examine four interpretations of the above view and argue that it is false on 
each interpretation. We then ask whether disability is thereby a neutral trait. 
Our view is that most disabilities are neutral in one sense, though we cannot 
make simple generalizations about disability's relationship to well-being in 
other important senses. After defending this view, we discuss its practical 
implications for selective abortion for disability, nondisabled people's 
interactions with disabled people, and the use of QALYs in health policy.

and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta, GA.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is 
recommended treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients, but the 
cost-effectiveness of IV rtPA within different time windows after the onset of 
acute ischemic stroke is not well reviewed.
AIMS: To conduct a literature review of the cost-effectiveness studies about IV 
rtPA by treatment times.
SUMMARY OF REVIEW: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
CINAHL and Cochrane Library, with the key words acute ischemic stroke, tissue 
plasminogen activator, cost, economic benefit, saving, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis. The review is limited to original research articles 
published during 1995-2016 in English-language peer-reviewed journals. We found 
16 studies meeting our criteria for this review. Nine of them were 
cost-effectiveness studies of IV rtPA treatment within 0-3 hours after stroke 
onset, 2 studies within 3-4.5 hours, 3 studies within 0-4.5 hours, and 2 study 
within 0-6 hours. IV rtPA is a cost-saving or a cost-effectiveness strategy from 
most of the study results. Only one study showed incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of IV rtPA within one year was marginally above $50,000 per QALY 
threshold. IV rtPA within 0-3 hours after stroke led to cost savings for 
lifetime or 30 years, and IV rtPA within 3-4.5 hours after stroke increased 
costs but still was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The literature generally showed that intravenous IV rtPA was a 
dominant or a cost-effective strategy compared to traditional treatment for 
acute ischemic stroke patients without IV rtPA. The findings from the literature 
lacked generalizability because of limited data and various assumptions.

BACKGROUND: Reliable estimation of future trends in life expectancy and the 
burden of disability is crucial for ageing societies. Previous forecasts have 
not considered the potential impact of trends in disease incidence. The present 
prediction model combines population trends in cardiovascular disease, dementia, 
disability, and mortality to forecast trends in life expectancy and the burden 
of disability in England and Wales up to 2025.
METHODS: We developed and validated the IMPACT-Better Ageing Model-a 
probabilistic model that tracks the population aged 35-100 years through ten 
health states characterised by the presence or absence of cardiovascular 
disease, dementia, disability (difficulty with one or more activities of daily 
living) or death up to 2025, by use of evidence-based age-specific, 
sex-specific, and year-specific transition probabilities. As shown in the 
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we projected continuing declines in 
dementia incidence (2·7% per annum), cardiovascular incidence, and mortality. 
The model estimates disability prevalence and disabled and disability-free life 
expectancy by year.
FINDINGS: Between 2015 and 2025, the number of people aged 65 years and older 
will increase by 19·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 17·7-20·9), from 10·4 
million (10·37-10·41 million) to 12·4 million (12·23-12·57 million). The number 
living with disability will increase by 25·0% (95% UI 21·3-28·2), from 2·25 
million (2·24-2·27 million) to 2·81 million (2·72-2·89 million). The 
age-standardised prevalence of disability among this population will remain 
constant, at 21·7% (95% UI 21·5-21·8) in 2015 and 21·6% (21·3-21·8) in 2025. 
Total life expectancy at age 65 years will increase by 1·7 years (95% UI 
0·1-3·6), from 20·1 years (19·9-20·3) to 21·8 years (20·2-23·6). Disability-free 
life expectancy at age 65 years will increase by 1·0 years (95% UI 0·1-1·9), 
from 15·4 years (15·3-15·5) to 16·4 years (15·5-17·3). However, life expectancy 
with disability will increase more in relative terms, with an increase of 
roughly 15% from 2015 (4·7 years, 95% UI 4·6-4·8) to 2025 (5·4 years, 4·7-6·4).
INTERPRETATION: The number of older people with care needs will expand by 25% by 
2025, mainly reflecting population ageing rather than an increase in prevalence 
of disability. Lifespans will increase further in the next decade, but a quarter 
of life expectancy at age 65 years will involve disability.

Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is present in approximately 50% of patients with 
trisomy 21 (T21) and Turner syndrome (TS). According to the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, every patient with these genetic disorders should have a postnatal 
echocardiogram. T21 is usually associated with atrioventricular (30%-60%), 
atrial (16%-21%), or ventricular septal defects (14%-27%). TS is usually 
associated with left-sided heart disease. However, the spectrum of CHD in these 
genetic disorders is wider than those mentioned lesions. More cardiac surgical 
procedures are offered to these patients and that has influenced positively 
their life expectancy for some CHD conditions. Single ventricular anatomy is 
associated with high mortality in these genetic disorders (49% in T21 and 
83%-91% in TS). The goal of this article is to describe the spectrum of CHD, 
screening guidelines, and cardiac surgical outcomes in patients with T21 or TS 
with CHD.

Recent discoveries in the non-coding genome have challenged the original central 
dogma of molecular biology, as non-coding RNAs and related processes have been 
found to be important in regulating gene expression. MicroRNAs and long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are among those that have gained attention recently in 
human diseases, including cancer, with the involvement of many more non-coding 
RNAs (ncRNAs) waiting to be discovered. ncRNAs are a group of ribonucleic acids 
transcribed from regions of the human genome, which do not become translated 
into proteins, despite having essential roles in cellular physiology. 
Deregulation of ncRNA expression and function has been observed in cancer 
pathogenesis. Recently, the roles of a group of ncRNA known as lncRNA have 
gained attention in cancer, with increasing reports of their oncogenic 
involvement. Female reproductive cancers remain a leading cause of death in the 
female population, accounting for almost a third of all female cancer deaths in 
2016. The Wnt signalling pathway is one of the most important oncogenic 
signalling pathways which is hyperactivated in cancers, including female 
reproductive cancers. The extension of ncRNA research into their mechanistic 
roles in human cancers has also led to novel reported roles of ncRNAs in the Wnt 
pathway and Wnt-mediated oncogenesis. This review aims to provide a critical 
summary of the respective roles and cellular functions of Wnt-associated lncRNAs 
in female reproductive cancers and explores the potential of circulating 
cell-free lncRNAs as diagnostic markers and lncRNAs as therapeutic targets.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the scalp has increased prevalence in older 
patients and often presents later in life. Mohs micrographic surgery remains the 
most effective treatment in most cases. Delayed presentation may result in 
localized bony invasion or distant metastases. We present a case of an elderly 
woman presenting with extension of SCC into the parietal bone of the skull.

Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, comprising a backbone of two nucleos(t)ide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus another ARV, is the recognized standard of 
care (SOC), which has helped extend life expectancy in people living with HIV. 
In a quest to reduce lifelong drug exposure and minimize or avoid the toxicity 
of NRTIs, "NRTI-reducing" regimens have been investigated. This descriptive 
review assessing the results of NRTI-reducing strategies from the largest 
randomized trials focuses on virological efficacy, resistance, regimen safety 
(in terms of bone mineral density, renal function, lipids and central nervous 
system function) and simplicity. The review considers efficacy across various 
NRTI-sparing strategies, for example an integrase strand transfer inhibitor 
(INSTI) plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) or PI/r + lamivudine 
(3TC), in both naïve and switch regimes. Of 10 key studies in treatment-naïve 
adults assessing five NRTI-reducing strategies, only four studies demonstrated 
noninferiority vs. SOC [GARDEL, NEAT 001, AIDS Clinical Trials Group 5142 and 
PROGRESS]. In switch settings, 17 studies (10 randomized) were reviewed that 
used four strategies, including three studies assessing an INSTI plus a 
nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Noninferiority of the 
NRTI-reducing arm was shown in six of 10 studies (ATLAS-M, SALT, DUAL, OLE, 
LATTE-2 and SWORD). In general, NRTI-reducing therapy did not always result in 
an improvement in short- or long-term adverse events; however, in many cases, 
these endpoints were not reported. Some of these studies reported higher 
virological failure rates with more frequent emergence of resistance mutations. 
None of these NRTI-reducing strategies has been compared against a single-pill 
regimen, including those containing tenofovir alafenamide. Only strategies 
demonstrating noninferior efficacy, a benefit in safety/tolerability, and a 
favourable cost-efficacy ratio, preferably in a single pill, will eventually 
match the current SOC of triple ARV therapy.

[Public spending on health and population health in Algeria: an econometric 
analysis].

[Article in French]

Messaili M, Kaïd Tlilane N.

Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of public 
spending on health, among other determinants of health, on the health of the 
population in Algeria, using life expectancy (men and women) and infant 
mortality rates as indicators of health status. Methods: We conducted a 
longitudinal study over the period from 1974 to 2010 using the ARDL 
(Autoregressive Distributed Lags) approach to co-integration to estimate the 
short-term and long-term relationship. Results: Public spending on health has a 
positive, but not statistically significant impact, in the long and short term, 
on life expectancy (men and women). However, public spending significantly 
reduces the infant mortality rate. The long-term impact of the number of 
hospital beds is significant for the life expectancy of men, but not for women 
and infant mortality, but is significant for all indicators in the short-term 
relationship. The most important variables in improving the health of the 
population are real GDP per capita and fertility rate.

Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of nationwide prevention of mother 
to child transmission (PMTCT) strategy for hepatitis B, and estimate the willing 
to pay and budget impacts on the PMTCT. Methods: The decision analytic Markov 
model for the PMTCT was constructed and a birth cohort of Chinese infants born 
in 2013 was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the PMTCT among them 
compared with those receiving no intervention. The parameters in the model were 
obtained from literatures of national surveys or Meta-analysis. The costs, cases 
of HBV-related diseases and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were obtained 
from the societal and payer perspectives, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as measures of strategy optimization. 
One-way and probability sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the 
uncertainty of the primary results. In addition, cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve and cost-effectiveness affordability curves were drawn to 
illustrate the cost effectiveness threshold and financial budget of the PMTCT 
strategy. Results: The lifetime cost for PMTCT strategy was 4 063.5 yuan (RMB) 
per carrier, which was 37 829.7 yuan (RMB) lower compared with those receiving 
no intervention. Due to the strategy, a total of 24.516 1 QALYs per person would 
be gained, which was higher than that in those receiving no intervention. From 
societal perspective, the ICER was -59 136.6 yuan (RMB) per additional QALYs 
gained, indicating that the PMTCT is cost effective. The results were reliable 
indicated by one-way, multi-way and probability sensitivity analyses. By the 
CEAC, the willing to pay was much lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold. 
From the affordability curve of the PMTCT strategy, the annual budget ranged 
from 590.4 million yuan (RMB) to 688.8 million yuan (RMB), which was lower than 
the financial ability. Based on the results of cost-effectiveness affordability 
curves, the higher annual budget was determined, the higher probability of 
affordability for the PMTCT would be obtained under the same willing to pay 
state. Only when the annual budget reaches 688.8 million yuan (RMB), the goal of 
PMTCT would be fully realized. Conclusions: The PMTCT strategy in China was cost 
effective, and the cost is not beyond the financial budget needed and the 
willing to pay. The strategy, which is consistent with the global hepatitis B 
elimination efforts, should be conducted widely in China.

Publisher: 目的： 分析我国乙型肝炎（乙肝）母婴阻断策略的成本效果价值，探索支付意愿和预算规模对项目持续投入的影响。 方法： 
以乙肝母婴阻断为研究策略，不接种为对照策略，采用决策分析马尔科夫模型，以我国2013年出生人口数为队列人群，通过TreeAge Pro 
2015软件实现模拟运行。分别从全社会和支付者角度计算成本，效果包括乙肝相关疾病人数和质量调整生命年（QALYs），策略间比较采用增量成本效果比（ICER）。由敏感性分析明确各参数的不确定性，绘制成本效果可支付曲线评价策略的可支付性。 
结果： 接受乙肝母婴阻断后终其一生所承担的成本为4 063.5元/人，比不接种节省37 829.7元/人。人均获得QALYs为24.516 
1，与不接种策略相比增加明显，且可以减少乙肝相关疾病的发生。从全社会角度看，乙肝母婴阻断与不接种相比，每多获得一个QALYs分别可节省59 
136.6元，根据本研究成本效果阈值，说明乙肝母婴阻断具有成本效果价值。一维、多维和概率敏感性分析显示，上述结果稳定可靠。成本效果可接受曲线显示，结果不会因公众支付意愿变化而影响，且研究策略完全实现的支付意愿小于成本效果阈值。可支付分析显示，我国实施该策略的年预算在5.904亿~6.888亿元，不会超出财政支付能力；同一支付意愿下，年预算越高本研究策略具有经济性及可支付性的概率越高，只有当年预算达到6.888亿元，该策略才能完全实现。 
结论： 我国推行的乙肝母婴阻断策略具有成本效果价值，并未超出公众支付意愿和财政预算能力，顺应了全球消除乙肝的目标要求，值得大力实施和推广。.

Objective: Since eliminating hepatitis B in China would need considerable public 
health resources, the economics problem of the strategy of community-based 
antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has become an important issue. 
The cost-effectiveness and affordability of the strategy were evaluated in this 
study. Methods: According to the advocacy on eliminating hepatitis B by WHO and 
the comprehensive protocol of community based prevention of major infectious 
diseases and the guideline for CHB prevention and treatment in China, the 
decision analytic Markov model was constructed with the parameters from national 
surveys or Meta-analysis. A cohort population aged 20-59 years was used as study 
subjects. The strategy of CHB antiviral treatment was compared with the 
strategies of hepatitis B vaccination and non-intervention, respectively. The 
costs and disability-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the strategies were 
calculated from the societal and payer perspectives. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) were 
calculated for the comparison of the strategies. One-way and probability 
sensitivity analysis were performed for uncertainty of the results. And the 
cost-effectiveness and affordability curves were introduced to estimate the 
budget impact on the strategies. Results: In the Chinese aged 20-59 years, the 
ICER of CHB antiviral treatment was 37 598.6 yuan (RMB) per QALYs and the ICERs 
were smaller in the low age groups, indicating that the antiviral treatment 
strategy is cost-effective and low age groups should be the priority population. 
The ICER of hepatitis B vaccination was -64 000.0 yuan (RMB) per QALYs, 
indicating that hepatitis B vaccination is cost saving. The CER of CHB antiviral 
treatment ranged from 731.8 to 1 813.3 yuan (RMB) per QALYs compared with 
hepatitis B vaccination, and the CER of CHB antiviral treatment was higher than 
that of hepatitis B vaccination in all age groups, indicating that hepatitis B 
vaccination would be more cost-effective than CHB antiviral treatment. The price 
of antiviral drug, entercavir, can influence the cost effectiveness of CHB 
antiviral treatment. If the price of entercavir declined half, CHB antiviral 
treatment would be cost-saving. The probability sensitivity analysis showed that 
people's willing to pay for CHB antiviral treatment should not be ignored, 
although the results of economics evaluation of CHB antiviral treatment were 
reliable. The results of affordability analysis indicated that the antiviral 
treatment strategy could not be implemented with the budget lower than 30 
million yuan (RMB), the probability of implementing the strategy was 42.6% if 
the budget reaches 127 million yuan (RMB), and only when the budget reaches 269 
million yuan (RMB), the goal of CHB antiviral treatment strategy can be fully 
realized. Conclusions: Although the strategy of CHB antiviral treatment as 
prevention in Chinese aged 20-59 years is cost-effective, it is not an 
appropriate public health measure due to the high cost. The cost effectiveness 
would be higher by conducting hepatitis B vaccination and then antiviral 
treatment in susceptible population.

Publisher: 目的： 我国消除乙型肝炎（乙肝）将会承受巨量的公共卫生资源，基于社区慢性乙肝（chronic hepatitis 
B，CHB）抗病毒治疗策略的经济学问题凸显，本研究对该策略的成本效果和可支付性做出评价。 方法： 
以WHO有关规划和我国重大传染病社区综合防治方案为策略依据，按照我国CHB防治指南确定抗病毒药物治疗和监测内容，遵循成本效果分析理论和方法构建决策分析马尔科夫模型，参数主要采用全国调查或Meta分析结果，利用TreeAge 
Pro 
2015软件实现模型构建和运行。以我国20~59岁社区人群为研究对象，分别从全社会和支付者角度计算成本，效果用质量调整生命年（QALYs），策略间比较采用增量成本效果比（ICER）或成本效果比（CER）。通过敏感性分析明确模型中各参数的不确定性，绘制成本效果可支付曲线评价策略的可支付性。 
结果： 我国20~59岁社区人群CHB抗病毒治疗策略的ICER为37 
598.6元/QALYs，低年龄组人群ICER较小，即每多获得一个QALYs需要增加投入但具有成本效果价值，抗病毒治疗应优先在低年龄人群中实施。乙肝疫苗接种策略的ICER为-64 
000.0元/QALYs，即该策略每多获得一个QALYs可节省成本，最具成本效果价值。人群CHB抗病毒治疗与乙肝疫苗接种策略对比，CER变动在731.8元和1 
813.3元/QALYs之间，各年龄人群乙肝疫苗接种的CER均低于抗病毒治疗策略，表明乙肝疫苗接种策略的经济学价值高于抗病毒治疗策略。恩替卡韦成本降低可提高抗病毒治疗策略的成本效果价值，当成本降至一半时，抗病毒治疗成为节省费用的策略。概率敏感性分析表明，抗病毒治疗策略的经济学评价结果可靠，该策略的成本效果价值受公众支付意愿的影响不能忽视。可支付分析发现，按照10万人计算，总预算小于0.3亿元，抗病毒治疗策略无法实现；总预算增加到1.27亿元时，该策略实现的概率为42.6%；只有当总预算达到2.69亿元，该策略才可以完全实现。 
结论： 
我国20~59岁社区人群CHB抗病毒治疗策略虽然符合成本效果价值，但作为公共卫生措施将耗资较多。对该人群易感者接种乙肝疫苗，再实施CHB抗病毒治疗，成本效果价值更高，印证了消除乙肝目标的合理性。.

BACKGROUND: In patients with left ventricular heart failure (HF), the 
development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common and represents a strong 
predictor of death. Despite recent advances in the pathophysiological 
understanding there is as yet no prospect of cure of this deadly clinical entity 
and the majority of patients continue to progress to right ventricular failure 
and die. Furthermore, there is no single medical treatment currently approved 
for PH related to HF. There is, therefore an urgent unmet need to identify novel 
pharmacological agents that will prevent the progressive increased or reverse 
the elevated pulmonary arterial pressures while enhancing cardiac performance in 
HF.
METHOD AND RESULTS: We here reported, for the first time, using a pressure-loop 
(P-V) conductance catheter system, that a specific natriuretic peptides 
clearance receptors' agonist, the ring-deleted atrial natriuretic peptide 
analogue, cANF4-23 (cANF) reduces pulmonary artery pressures. Strikingly, the 
administration of the cANF in these mice decreased the RVSP by 50% (n=5, F 
25.687, DF 14, p<0.001) and heart rate (HR) by 11% (n=5, F 25.69, DF 14, 
p<0.001) as well as enhancing cardiac performance including left ventricular 
contractility in mice. Most strikingly, mice lacking NPR-C were much more 
susceptible to develop HF, indicating that NPR-C is a critical protective 
receptor in the heart.
CONCLUSION: Natriuretic peptides clearance receptors' agonists may, therefore 
represent a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy for PH related to HF, and 
ultimately improves the life expectancy and quality for millions of people 
around the planet.

BACKGROUND: Toe grip strength is the force of a toe on a surface. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the relationship between falls in middle-aged 
individuals and physical strength factors such as toe grip strength and knee 
extension strength.
METHODS: The subjects were 194 middle-aged individuals (388 feet) who were 
independent in daily life, received no nursing care, and participated in a 
health sports event organized by a sports club. We evaluated the body 
composition, blood pressure, vascular age, systemic response, bone density, knee 
extension strength, and toe grip strength, and examined their relationship using 
a self-administered questionnaire survey.
RESULTS: The fall, near-fall, and no fall groups included 7, 36, and 151 
subjects, respectively; the high and low risk groups included 43 and 151 
subjects, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed with risk of 
falls as the dependent variable, and factors that showed a significant 
difference in the comparison of the high and low risk groups as independent 
variables. In this analysis, toe grip strength and diastolic blood pressure were 
identified as independent risk factors for a fall.
CONCLUSIONS: Toe grip strength is an independent risk factor for falls, and 
improvement of toe grip strength might prevent falls.

BACKGROUND: Homicide - a lethal expression of violence - has garnered little 
attention from public health researchers and health policy makers, despite the 
fact that homicides are a cause of preventable and premature death. Identifying 
populations at risk and the upstream determinants of homicide are important for 
addressing inequalities that hinder population health. This population-based 
study investigates the public health significance of homicides in Ontario, 
Canada, over the period of 1999-2012. We quantified the relative burden of 
homicides by comparing the socioeconomic gradient in homicides with the leading 
causes of death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neoplasm, and estimated the 
potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to homicide.
METHODS: We linked vital statistics from the Office of the Registrar General 
Deaths register (ORG-D) with Census and administrative data for all Ontario 
residents. We extracted all homicide, neoplasm, and cardiovascular deaths from 
1999 to 2012, using International Classification of Diseases codes. For 
socioeconomic status (SES), we used two dimensions of the Ontario 
Marginalization Index (ON-Marg): material deprivation and residential 
instability. Trends were summarized across deprivation indices using 
age-specific rates, rate ratios, and PYLL.
RESULTS: Young males, 15-29 years old, were the main victims of homicide with a 
rate of 3.85 [IC 95%: 3.56; 4.13] per 100,000 population and experienced an 
upward trend over the study period. The socioeconomic neighbourhood gradient was 
substantial and higher than the gradient for both cardiovascular and neoplasms. 
Finally, the PYLL due to homicide were 63,512 and 24,066 years for males and 
females, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Homicides are an important cause of death among young males, and 
populations living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Our findings raise concerns 
about the burden of homicides in the Canadian population and the importance of 
addressing social determinants to address these premature deaths.

BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a feared complication of peripheral 
vascular disease that often requires surgical management and may require 
amputation of the affected limb. We developed a decision model to inform 
clinical management for a 63-year-old woman with CLI and multiple medical 
comorbidities, including advanced heart failure and diabetes.
METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to evaluate 4 strategies: 
amputation, surgical bypass, endovascular therapy (e.g. stent or 
revascularization), and medical management. We measured the impact of parameter 
uncertainty using 1-way, 2-way, and multiway sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base case, endovascular therapy yielded similar discounted 
quality-adjusted life months (26.50 QALMs) compared with surgical bypass (26.34 
QALMs). Both endovascular and surgical therapies were superior to amputation 
(18.83 QALMs) and medical management (11.08 QALMs). This finding was robust to a 
wide range of periprocedural mortality weights and was most sensitive to 
long-term mortality associated with endovascular and surgical therapies. Utility 
weights were not stratified by patient comorbidities; nonetheless, our 
conclusion was robust to a range of utility weight values.
CONCLUSIONS: For a patient with CLI, endovascular therapy and surgical bypass 
provided comparable clinical outcomes. However, this finding was sensitive to 
long-term mortality rates associated with each procedure. Both endovascular and 
surgical therapies were superior to amputation or medical management in a range 
of scenarios.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to present the results in a consecutive 
series of patients affected by aortic abdominal aneurysm and to underline the 
aneurysmal growth and evolution in oncological patients submitted to dedicated 
oncological medical therapy.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2016 we treated in our center 19 patients 
for coexisting aortic aneurysms (>3 cm) and malignancy. We observed patients 
undergoing oncological treatment and patients who did not undergo medical 
treatment. We studied computed tomography (CT) scan at the time when patients 
were addressed at our follow-up or treatment and we analyzed retrospectively 
prior CT scan at 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Among those 19 patients, 7 patients were affected by colorectal cancer 
(36.8%), 6 by urinary tract cancer (31.6%), 4 by lymphoma (21%), and 2 by lung 
cancer (10.6%). In 8 patients who did not undergo oncological therapy, we did 
not observe any aortic growth; instead, in other 4 patients who underwent 
oncological medical therapy (3 abdominal aortic aneurysms and 1 thoracic 
aneurysm), we observed a mean sac growth of 2.9 cm in 6 months with 2 cases of 
aortic rupture treated in urgent fashion. The treatment was open surgery in 2 
cases and endovascular in other cases.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that oncological drugs may play a role in aneurysm 
growth. Few case reports are found in the literature and more evidences are to 
be found. Those information may influence intention-to-treat small aneurysms in 
short life expectancy patients.

BACKGROUND: Mass media campaigns and quitlines are both important distinct 
components of tobacco control programmes around the world. But when used as an 
integrated package, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are not well 
described. We therefore aimed to estimate the health gain, health equity impacts 
and cost-utility of the package of a national quitline service and its promotion 
in the mass media.
METHODS: We adapted an established Markov and multistate life-table 
macro-simulation model. The population was all New Zealand adults in 2011. 
Effect sizes and intervention costs were based on past New Zealand quitline 
data. Health system costs were from a national data set linking individual 
health events to costs.
RESULTS: The 1-year operation of the existing intervention package of mass media 
promotion and quitline service was found to be net cost saving to the health 
sector for all age groups, sexes and ethnic groups (saving $NZ84 million; 
95%uncertainty interval 60-115 million in the base-case model). It also produced 
greater per capita health gains for Māori (indigenous) than non-Māori (2.2 vs 
0.73 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per 1000 population, respectively). The 
net cost saving of the intervention was maintained in all sensitivity and 
scenario analyses for example at a discount rate of 6% and when the intervention 
effect size was quartered (given the possibility of residual confounding in our 
estimates of smoking cessation). Running the intervention for 20 years would 
generate an estimated 54 000 QALYs and $NZ1.10 billion (US$0.74 billion) in cost 
savings.
CONCLUSIONS: The package of a quitline service and its promotion in the mass 
media appears to be an effective means to generate health gain, address health 
inequalities and save health system costs. Nevertheless, the role of this 
intervention needs to be compared with other tobacco control and health sector 
interventions, some of which may be even more cost saving.

AIM: In the present study we assessed if postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) using 
conventional fractionation confers a benefit in cutaneous melanoma patients with 
lymph node (LN) metastasis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with axillary or inguinal LN metastasis 
were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight patients received PORT. The median 
RT dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The high-risk group was defined by the 
presence of any of the following: ≥3 LNs, size ≥3 cm, extranodal extension.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 34 months. PORT showed a significant 
benefit on 5-year axilla-inguinal recurrence-free survival (RFS) in high-risk 
patients (RT 100% vs. No-RT 37%, p=0.001). There was also a benefit of RT on 
5-year out-field RFS in the high-risk population (RT 93% vs. No-RT 29%, 
p=0.002). There were no ≥grade 2 lymphedemas after RT.
CONCLUSION: PORT using conventional fractionation for high-risk LN metastasis 
from cutaneous melanoma is feasible with comparable regional control and minimal 
toxicity.

Understanding relationships between diseases, such as comorbidities, has 
important socio-economic implications, ranging from clinical study design to 
health care planning. Most studies characterize disease comorbidity using shared 
genetic origins, ignoring pathway-based commonalities between diseases. In this 
study, we define the disease pathways using an interactome-based extension of 
known disease-genes and introduce several measures of functional overlap. The 
analysis reveals 206 significant links among 94 diseases, giving rise to a 
highly clustered disease association network. We observe that around 95% of the 
links in the disease network, though not identified by genetic overlap, are 
discovered by functional overlap. This disease network portraits rheumatoid 
arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, pulmonary diseases and Crohn's disease as 
hubs and thus pointing to common inflammatory processes underlying disease 
pathophysiology. We identify several described associations such as the inverse 
comorbidity relationship between Alzheimer's disease and neoplasms. Furthermore, 
we investigate the disruptions in protein interactions by mapping mutations onto 
the domains involved in the interaction, suggesting hypotheses on the causal 
link between diseases. Finally, we provide several proof-of-principle examples 
in which we model the effect of the mutation and the change of the association 
strength, which could explain the observed comorbidity between diseases caused 
by the same genetic alterations.

Treatment-related Cardiovascular Toxicity in Long-term Survivors of Testicular 
Cancer.

BACKGROUNDS: Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in young men. 
Considering increasing incidence, exceptionally high cure rate, as well as long 
life expectancy, assessment of long term toxicity in testicular cancer survivors 
is of great importance. In the last decades a major effort has been made in 
order to reduce toxicity of treatment, while maintaining its high effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Actual knowledge on treatment toxicity is based on outdated 
treatment modalities. Hopefully, modern treatment modalities could reduce 
toxicity, but, there is no firm confirmation for that at the moment, as data 
dealing with late sequelae of modern treatment of testicular cancer are not 
available yet due to the short period of observation. The life-threatening 
cardiovascular toxicity in testicular cancer survivors is major complication of 
platinum-based chemotherapy, mediastinal radiotherapy and even subdiaphragmatic 
radiotherapy.
