Life expectancy decreases with aging, with cardiovascular, mental health, and 
neurodegenerative disorders strongly contributing to the total 
disability-adjusted life years. Interestingly, the morbidity/mortality paradox 
points to females having a worse healthy life expectancy. Since bidirectional 
interactions between cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases (AD) have been 
reported, the study of this emerging field is promising. In the present work, we 
further explored the cardiovascular-brain interactions in mice survivors of two 
cohorts of non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice, including both sexes, to investigate 
the frailty/survival through their life span. Survival, monitored from birth, 
showed exceptionally worse mortality rates in females than males, independently 
of the genotype. This mortality selection provided a "survivors" cohort that 
could unveil brain-cardiovascular interaction mechanisms relevant for normal and 
neurodegenerative aging processes restricted to long-lived animals. The results 
show sex-dependent distinct physical (worse in 3xTg-AD males), 
neuropsychiatric-like and cognitive phenotypes (worse in 3xTg-AD females), and 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation (higher in females), with 
higher cerebral blood flow and improved cardiovascular phenotype in 3xTg-AD 
female mice survivors. The present study provides an experimental scenario to 
study the suggested potential compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms in end-of-life 
dementia, which is sex-dependent and can be a target for pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions.

Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) is one of the major 
bacterial species responsible for acne vulgaris. Numerous bioactive compounds 
from Momordica charantia Linn. var. abbreviata Ser. have been isolated and 
examined for many years. In this study, we evaluated the suppressive effect of 
two cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, 
5β,19-epoxycucurbita-6,23-dien-3β,19,25-triol (Kuguacin R; KR) and 
3β,7β,25-trihydroxycucurbita-5,23-dien-19-al (TCD) on live C. acnes-stimulated 
in vitro and in vivo inflammatory responses. Using human THP-1 monocytes, KR or 
TCD suppressed C. acnes-induced production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 
at least above 56% or 45%, as well as gene expression of these three 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, a significantly strong inhibitory effect on 
production and expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was not observed. 
Both cucurbitanes inhibited C. acnes-induced activation of the myeloid 
differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) (up to 62%) and mitogen-activated 
protein kinases (MAPK) (at least 36%). Furthermore, TCD suppressed the 
expression of pro-caspase-1 and cleaved caspase-1 (p10). In a separate study, KR 
or TCD decreased C. acnes-stimulated mouse ear edema by ear thickness (20% or 
14%), and reduced IL-1β-expressing leukocytes and neutrophils in mouse ears. We 
demonstrated that KR and TCD are potential anti-inflammatory agents for 
modulating C. acnes-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo.

Increased hyaluronic acid (HA) production is often associated with cancer 
progression. In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), HA is found at elevated 
levels in pleural effusions and sera of patients, and it has been widely debated 
whether MPM cells are able to produce HA by themselves or through the release of 
growth factors stimulating other cells. Another key component of the MPM 
microenvironment is C1q, which can act as a pro-tumorigenic factor favoring cell 
adhesion, migration and proliferation. The aim of the current study was to prove 
that MPM primary cells are able to synthesize HA and to inquire the stimulus 
given by C1q-HA matrix to HA synthesis. We confirmed the presence of a HA coat 
and cable-like structures around MPM primary cells, as well as an intracellular 
pool, mainly localized in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear region. After 
evaluating HA synthase (HAS) enzymes' basal expression in MPM primary cells, we 
found that C1q bound to HA was able to impinge upon HA homeostasis by 
upregulating HAS3 both at the mRNA and the protein levels. High expression of 
HAS3 has been correlated with a shorter life expectancy in MPM by 
bioinformatical analysis. These data confirmed that C1q bound to HA may exert 
pro-tumorigenic activity and identified HAS3 as a potential target in MPM.

OBJECTIVE: People living with HIV (PLWHIV) have now a near-normal life 
expectancy and thus, a higher risk of polypharmacy. The main objective was to 
assess the correlation between medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) and 
quality of life (EQ-5D) and health utilities among PLWHIV patients on ART.
METHODS: Observational prospective single-center study including adult PLWHIV on 
ART from January to March-2020 attended at hospital pharmacy outpatient service 
according to a Capacity-Motivation-Opportunity (CMO) pharmaceutical care model.
RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included, mean age of 50 ± 10.9 years, 
82.2% males. Negative correlation (r2=-0.147; p= 0.0002) between MRCI and EQ-5D 
was found. Relationship between the comorbidity pattern and quality of life, was 
also observed. Regarding MRCI, Anxiety/Depression, Pain/discomfort and Self-Care 
were the dimensions with the worst assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: A new multidimensional revised care plan for PLWHIV focussed on 
optimising overall patient care, not limited to viral load goal achievement 
alone but also in their pharmacotherapeutic complexity and quality of life is 
needed.

OBJETIVOS: Los pacientes VIH tienen ahora una esperanza de vida casi normal y, 
por tanto, un mayor riesgo de polifarmacia. El objetivo principal fue evaluar la 
correlación entre el índice de complejidad de la medicación (MRCI) y la calidad 
de vida (EQ-5D) y su influencia en la salud de los pacientes VIH en tratamiento 
antirretroviral (TAR).
PACIENTES Y MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional prospectivo en un solo centro que 
incluyó a pacientes adultos con TAR de enero a marzo de 2020, atendidos en las 
consultas de farmacia hospitalaria de acuerdo con un modelo CMO de atención 
farmacéutica.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 428 pacientes, edad media 50 ± 10,9 años, 82,2% 
varones. Se encontró correlación negativa (r2 = −0,147; p = 0,0002) entre MRCI y 
el índice de calidad de vida EQ-5D. También se observó relación entre el patrón 
de comorbilidad y el EQ-5D. En cuanto al MRCI, Ansiedad / Depresión, Dolor / 
malestar y Autocuidado fueron las dimensiones con peor valoración.
CONCLUSIONES: Se necesita un nuevo plan de atención multidimensional revisado 
para pacientes VIH en tratamiento con TAR, centrado en optimizar la atención 
general del paciente, y no limitado sólo al logro de la meta de carga viral, 
sino también en su complejidad farmacoterapéutica y calidad de vida.

BACKGROUND: While assessment of sex differentials in child mortality is 
straightforward, their interpretation must consider that, in the absence of 
gender bias, boys are more likely to die than girls. The expected differences 
are also influenced by levels and causes of death. However, there is no standard 
approach for determining expected sex differences.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review of studies on sex differentials in 
under-five mortality, using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. 
Publication characteristics were described, and studies were grouped according 
to their methodology.
RESULTS: From the 17,693 references initially retrieved we included 154 studies 
published since 1929. Indian, Bangladeshi, and Chinese populations were the 
focus of 44% of the works, and most studies addressed infant mortality. Fourteen 
publications were classified as reference studies, as these aimed to estimate 
expected sex differentials based upon the demographic experience of selected 
populations, either considered as gender-neutral or not. These studies used a 
variety of methods - from simple averages to sophisticated modeling - to define 
values against which observed estimates could be compared. The 21 comparative 
studies mostly used life tables from European populations as standard for 
expected values, but also relied on groups without assuming those values as 
expected, otherwise, just as comparison parameters. The remaining 119 studies 
were categorized as narrative and did not use reference values, being limited to 
reporting observed sex-specific estimates or used a variety of statistical 
models, and in general, did not account for mortality levels.
CONCLUSION: Studies aimed at identifying sex differentials in child mortality 
should consider overall mortality levels, and report on more than one age group. 
The comparison of results with one or more reference values, and the use of 
statistical testing, are strongly recommended. Time trends analyses will help 
understand changes in population characteristics and interpret findings from a 
historical perspective.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a common non-communicable disease that is 
responsible for about 9% of all deaths and a 25% reduction in life expectancy. 
However, nearly half of the diabetic patients are not aware of their disease. In 
this regard, to identify un-known diabetic patients, diabetes screening is of 
great importance. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two 
commonly used diabetes screening tests that are currently recommended by the 
Iranian diabetes screening program for (DSP).
METHODS: The validity of the two diabetes screening tests were measured among 
1057 participants who were older than 30 years of age. The studied screening 
tests included capillary fasting blood glucose (CBG) and glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c). The golden standard for measuring the validity of the tests was venous 
fasting plasma glucose (VPG).
RESULTS: According to the results, the sensitivity of CBG and HbA1c tests was 
69.01% and 84.5%, and the specificity of the tests were 95.7% and 79.3%, 
respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 53.84% and 97.72% for 
CBG and 22.72% and 98.61% for HbA1c, respectively. The recommended cut points 
for CBG and HbA1c were 116.5 mg/dl and 7.15%, respectively. Using these values 
as the new cut points, sensitivity and specificity of CBG and HbA1c changed to 
80.30% and 89.10%, and 77.50% and 94.20%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to several other countries, the performance of Iranian DSP 
is relatively better. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve suggested new 
cut points for significantly better performance of DSP.

Potato virus Y (PVY) and zebra chip (ZC) disease are major threats to 
solanaceous crop production in North America. PVY can be spread by aphid vectors 
and through vegetative propagation in potatoes. ZC is associated with 
"Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum" (Lso), which is transmitted by the 
tomato/potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli Šulc (Hemiptera: Triozidae). As 
these two pathosystems may co-occur, we studied whether the presence of one 
virus strain, PVY°, affected the host preference, oviposition, and egg hatch 
rate of Lso-free or Lso-carrying psyllids in tomato plants. We also examined 
whether PVY infection influenced Lso transmission success by psyllids, Lso titer 
and plant chemistry (amino acids, sugars, and phytohormones). Lso-carrying 
psyllids showed a preference toward healthy hosts, whereas the Lso-free psyllids 
preferentially settled on the PVY-infected tomatoes. Oviposition of the 
Lso-carrying psyllids was lower on PVY-infected than healthy tomatoes, but Lso 
transmission, titer, and psyllid egg hatch were not significantly affected by 
PVY. The induction of salicylic acid and its related responses, and not 
nutritional losses, may explain the reduced attractiveness of the PVY-infected 
host to the Lso-carrying psyllids. Although our study demonstrated that 
pre-existing PVY infection can reduce oviposition by the Lso-carrying vector, 
the preference of the Lso-carrying psyllids to settle on healthy hosts could 
contribute to Lso spread to healthy plants in the presence of PVY infection in a 
field.

A decrease in the elasticity of the ocular lens during aging is associated with 
loss of the accommodative ability of the eye, leading to presbyopia. Although 
near vision impairment is a social issue affecting the length of healthy life 
expectancy and productivity of elderly people, an effective treatment to improve 
near vision has not yet become available. Here we examined the effect of 
Enterococcus faecium WB2000, Lactobacillus pentosus TJ515, and resveratrol on 
lens elasticity in rats, where the stiffness of the ocular lens increases 
exponentially during the aging process. A combination of WB2000 and resveratrol 
improved lens elasticity not only in the long term but also with just short-term 
treatment. In addition, TJ515 decreased stiffness in the eye lens with long-term 
treatment. Therefore, the oral administration of WB2000 and resveratrol or TJ515 
may be a potential approach for managing the progression of near vision 
impairment.

BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal tumor, most often 
found in the long bones, and usually affecting children and adolescents in the 
second decade of life. ES of the spine is a clinical rarity.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of lower 
back pain which acutely worsened in conjunction with urinary retention. The 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass extending from L5 to S2 with 
additional extension through the left S2-3 neural foramen. The metastatic workup 
was negative. At surgery, the lesion was both intradural and extradural. 
Following complete surgical resection, the patient was later treated with 
radiation and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Here, we report an adult male who acutely presented with low back 
pain attributable to primary intradural/extradural sacral ES.

preservation in unmarried patients with haematological malignancies?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Oocyte cryopreservation via the vitrification method is 
accessible and may be considered an option for fertility preservation in 
unmarried patients with haematological malignancies.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Haematological malignancies are most commonly observed 
amongst adolescent and young adult women. Although the survival rate and life 
expectancy of those with haematological malignancies have improved, chemotherapy 
and radiotherapy may impair their reproductive potential. Oocyte 
cryopreservation is thus an ideal option to preserve their fertility.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: This study retrospectively evaluated 193 unmarried 
patients (age: 26.2 ± 0.4 years) with haematological malignancies, who consulted 
for oocyte cryopreservation across 20 different fertility centres in Japan 
between February 2007 and January 2015. The primary outcome measures were the 
oocyte retrievals and oocyte cryopreservation outcomes. The secondary outcome 
measures were the outcomes following oocyte warming for IVF.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: The patients had commenced ovarian 
stimulation cycles via antagonist, agonist, natural and minimal methods for 
oocyte retrievals, defined according to the treatment strategy of each 
respective fertility centre. A vitrification method using the Cryotop safety kit 
was used for oocyte cryopreservation. ICSIs were used for insemination of warmed 
oocytes. The endometrial preparation method for embryo transfer was hormonal 
replacement therapy, except in the case of a patient who underwent a spontaneous 
ovulatory cycle.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among 193 patients, acute myeloid leukaemia 
(n = 45, 23.3%) was most common, followed by acute lymphoid leukaemia (n = 38, 
19.7%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 30, 15.5%). In total, 162 patients (83.9%) 
underwent oocyte retrieval, and oocytes were successfully cryopreserved for 155 
patients (80.3%). The mean number of oocyte retrieval cycles and cryopreserved 
oocytes were 1.7 ± 0.2 and 6.3 ± 0.4, respectively. As of December 2019, 14 
patients (9.2%) had requested oocyte warming for IVF. The survival rate of 
oocytes after vitrification-warming was 85.2% (75/88). The rates of 
fertilisation and embryo development were 80.0% (60/75) and 46.7% (28/60), 
respectively. Ten patients (71.4%) had successful embryo transfers, and seven 
live births (50.0%) were achieved.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was limited by its retrospective 
nature. Additionally, there remains an insufficient number of cases regarding 
the warming of vitrified oocytes to reliably conclude whether oocyte 
cryopreservation is effective for patients with haematological malignancies. 
Further long-term follow-up study is required.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Oocyte retrieval and oocyte cryopreservation 
were accessible for patients with haematological malignancies; however, the 
number of oocyte retrievals may have been limited due to the initiation of 
cancer treatments. Acceptable embryonic and pregnancy outcomes could be achieved 
following oocyte warming; therefore, our results suggest that oocyte 
cryopreservation can be considered an option for fertility preservation in 
patients with haematological malignancies.

PURPOSE: Assessment of treatment of cancer patients with bowel obstruction, 
identification of prognostic factors, and assessment of reference to palliative 
care.
METHODS: Records of patients with a diagnosis of bowel obstruction over a 
6-month (January-June 2013) period were reviewed.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were diagnosed with bowel obstruction. Fifty-one 
(68%) were female and the median age was 65 years (27-100). The most frequent 
cancer was colorectal, 30 (40%), followed by gynecological cancer, 20 (27%). 
Forty-three (57%) patients underwent conservative treatment; 26 (35%) underwent 
surgery; and 6 (8%) had a stent placement. In 68 (91%), the bowel obstruction 
was resolved. Three years after the bowel obstruction episode, 15 (20%) patients 
were still alive. An analysis of the possible association of variables recorded 
with mortality was carried out, and for death at the first admission, only the 
resolution of the obstruction was significant (P < .001); for the 3-year 
survival the significant factors were hemoglobin >10.7 g/dL (P < .001) and 
ascites (P = .001) at the time of obstruction. Thirty-seven (49%) patients were 
referred to palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: Although bowel obstruction in cancer patients is usually associated 
with a short life expectancy, some patients have relatively long survivals. Only 
about half of the patients were referred to palliative care.

STUDY QUESTION: What is the current burden of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) 
at the global, regional, and country-specific levels in 194 countries and 
territories according to age and socio-demographic index (SDI)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Slight increases in age-standardized incidence of PCOS and 
associated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were evidenced among women of 
reproductive age (15-49 years) from 2007 to 2017 at the global level, and in 
most regions and countries.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: No detailed quantitative estimates of the PCOS incidence 
and DALYs by age and SDI in these 194 countries and territories have been 
published previously.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: An age- and SDI-stratified systematic analysis of 
the PCOS incidence and DALYs across 194 countries and territories has been 
performed.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to estimate the total and 
age-standard PCOS incidence rates and DALYs rates among women of reproductive 
age in both 2007 and 2017, and the trends in these parameters from 2007 to 2017.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Globally, women of reproductive age 
accounted for 1.55 million (95% uncertainty intervals (UIs): 1.19-2.08) incident 
cases of PCOS and 0.43 million (0.19-0.82) associated DALYs. The global 
age-standardized PCOS incidence rate among women of reproductive age increased 
to 82.44 (64.65-100.24) per 100 000 population in 2017, representing an increase 
of 1.45% (1.43-1.47%) from 2007 to 2017. The rate of age-standardized DALYs 
increased to 21.96 (12.78-31.15) per 100 000 population in 2017, representing an 
increase of 1.91% (1.89-1.93%) from 2007 to 2017. Over the study period, the 
greatest increase in the age-standardized PCOS incidence and DALYs rates were 
observed in the middle-SDI and high-middle SDI regions, respectively. At the GBD 
regional level, the highest age-standardized incidence and DALY rates in 2017 
were observed in Andean Latin America, whereas the largest percentage increases 
in both rates from 2007 to 2017 were observed in Tropical Latin America. At the 
national level, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Japan, and Bermuda had the highest 
age-standardized incidence rates and DALYs rates in both 2007 and 2017. The 
highest increases in both the age-standardized incidence rates and DALYs rates 
from 2007 to 2017 were observed in Ethiopia, Brazil, and China.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although the GBD (2017) study aimed to gather 
all published and unpublished data, the limited availability of data in some 
regions might have led to the estimation of wide UIs. Additionally, the PCOS 
phenotype is complicated and the diagnostic criteria are constantly changing. 
Consequently, the incidence of PCOS might have been underestimated.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Knowledge about the differences in the PCOS 
burden across various locations will be valuable for the allocation of resources 
and formulation of effective preventive strategies.

Aging is a physiological process mediated by numerous biological and genetic 
pathways, which are directly linked to lifespan and are a driving force for all 
age-related diseases. Human life expectancy has greatly increased in the past 
few decades, but this has not been accompanied by a similar increase in their 
healthspan. At present, research on aging biology has focused on elucidating the 
biochemical and genetic pathways that contribute to aging over time. Several 
aging mechanisms have been identified, primarily including genomic instability, 
telomere shortening, and cellular senescence. Aging is a driving factor of 
various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, 
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal 
disorders. Efforts to find drugs that improve the healthspan by targeting the 
pathogenesis of aging have now become a hot topic in this field. In the present 
review, the status of aging research and the development of potential drugs for 
aging-related diseases, such as metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, senolytics, 
as well as caloric restriction, are summarized. The feasibility, side effects, 
and future potential of these treatments are also discussed, which will provide 
a basis to develop novel anti-aging therapeutics for improving the healthspan 
and preventing aging-related diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor 
for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients 
with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional 
treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in 
Germany.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in 
long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the 
perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve 
or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab 
biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, 
ustekinumab, and conventional therapy. Health states modeled were remission, 
treatment response, active UC, and post-colectomy. Patients not responding to 
treatment could switch to a different treatment. Treatment efficacy for 
induction and maintenance phases were assessed by a systematic literature review 
(SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The model included costs associated with 
drug administration, adverse events, and medical resource use. Extensive 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were 
conducted.
RESULTS: Over a life-time horizon, patients treated with tofacitinib gained 
0.035-0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and had direct cost savings to 
the SHI of €4,228-€17,184 compared to biologic treatments other than adalimumab 
biosimilar. When compared to adalimumab biosimilar, treatment with tofacitinib 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €17,497 per QALY 
gained and can be considered a cost-effective alternative. Compared with 
conventional therapy, tofacitinib resulted in a lower ICER than all other 
biologics. The DSA showed that the model results were most influenced by 
differences in treatment efficacy. The PSA suggested confidence in the base-case 
results considering uncertainty around parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this economic model suggest tofacitinib is a 
cost-effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe UC in 
Germany.

Management Algorithms for Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms.

Kim HS(1), Jang JY(1).

Author information:
(1)From the Department of Surgery and Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National 
University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

CONTEXT.—: The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased 
owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in 
differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should 
accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, 
previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different 
indications for treatment.
OBJECTIVE.—: To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic 
change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal 
management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of 
view.
DATA SOURCES.—: Literature review of published studies and the authors' own 
work.
CONCLUSIONS.—: The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present 
or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is 
sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic 
neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid 
pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has 
been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 
cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored 
because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies 
should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is 
needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy 
potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks 
and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment 
methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.

INTRODUCTION: There is a substantial lack of home-based exercise programs in the 
highly vulnerable group of geriatric patients with cognitive impairment (CI) 
after discharge from ward rehabilitation. Beyond clinical effectiveness, the 
cost-effectiveness of intervention programs to enhance physical performance is 
not well investigated in this target group.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 
12-week home-based exercise intervention following discharge from ward 
rehabilitation compared to unspecified flexibility training for geriatric 
patients with CI from a societal perspective.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness study was conducted alongside a randomized 
placebo-controlled trial. A total of 118 geriatric patients with CI (Mini-Mental 
State Examination score: 17-26) were randomized either to the intervention group 
(IG, n = 63) or control group (CG, n = 55). Participants in the IG received a 
home-based individually tailored exercise program to increase physical 
performance, while participants in the CG received unspecific flexibility 
training (placebo control). Healthcare service use, physical performance (Short 
Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) were 
measured over 24 weeks. The net monetary benefit (NMB) approach was applied to 
calculate incremental cost-effectiveness of the exercise intervention compared 
to the CG with respect to improvement of (a) physical performance on the SPPB 
and (b) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Physical performance was significantly improved in the IG compared to 
the CG (mean difference at 24 weeks: 1.3 points; 95% confidence interval [95% 
CI] = 0.5-2.2; p = 0.003), while health-related quality of life did not 
significantly differ between the groups at 24 weeks (mean difference: 0.08; 95% 
CI = -0.05 to 0.21; p = 0.218). Mean costs to implement the home-based exercise 
intervention were EUR 284 per patient. The probability of a positive incremental 
NMB of the intervention reached a maximum of 92% at a willingness to pay (WTP) 
of EUR 500 per point on the SPPB. The probability of cost-utility referring to 
QALYs was 85% at a WTP of EUR 5,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The home-based exercise intervention demonstrated high probability 
of cost-effectiveness in terms of improved physical performance in older adults 
with CI following discharge from ward rehabilitation, but not in terms of 
quality of life.

AIM: The role of preoperative frailty assessment in patients with 
gastrointestinal (GI) disease remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the 
relationship between frailty and postoperative outcomes in patients with GI 
disease.
METHODS: This study investigated 42 patients (aged ≥65 years) with GI disease 
who underwent abdominal surgery. The frailty status was analyzed using the 
Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. We also 
investigated postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, seven (16.7%) were robust, 24 (57.1%) were prefrail 
and 11 (26.2%) were frail. Postoperative complications were observed in 45.5% 
and 63.6% of prefrail and frail patients, respectively, whereas no complications 
were found in robust patients (P = 0.026). The median hospital stay was 15, 19.5 
and 27 days in robust, prefrail and frail patients, respectively (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty status based on the Japanese version of the 
Cardiovascular Health Study criteria is associated with postoperative 
complication incidence and hospital stay extension in patients with GI disease.

BYL719 (alpelisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K p110α developed for 
cancer therapy. Targeted suppression of PI3K has led to lifespan extension in 
rodents and model organisms. If PI3K inhibitors are to be considered as an aging 
therapeutic, it is important to understand the potential consequences of 
long-term exposure, and the most practical way to achieve this is through diet 
administration. Here, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of BYL719 delivered 
in diet and the efficacy of BYL719 to suppress insulin signaling when 
administered in the diet of 8-month-old male and female mice. Compared to oral 
gavage, diet incorporation resulted in a lower peak plasma BYL719 (3.6 vs. 9.2 
μM) concentration but similar half-life (~1.5 h). Consuming BYL719 resulted in 
decreased insulin signaling in liver and muscle within 72 h, and mice still 
showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity following 6 weeks of 
access to a diet containing 0.3 g/kg BYL719. However, consuming BYL719 did not 
affect food intake, body mass, muscle function (rotarod and hang time 
performance) or cognitive behaviors. This provides evidence that BYL719 has 
long-term efficacy without major toxicity or side effects, and suggests that 
administering BYL719 in diet is suitable for studying the effect of 
pharmacological suppression of PI3K p110α on aging and metabolic function.

Distant metastases are the main cause of cancer-related deaths in patients with 
advanced tumors. A standard diagnostic workup usually contains the 
identification of the tissue-of-origin of metastatic tumors, although under 
certain circumstances, it remains elusive. This disease setting is defined as 
cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Accounting for approximately 3-5% of all cancer 
diagnoses, CUPs are characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior and 
represent a real therapeutic challenge. The lack of determination of a tissue of 
origin precludes CUP patients from specific evidence-based therapeutic options 
or access to clinical trial, which significantly impacts their life expectancy. 
In the era of precision medicine, it is essential to characterize CUP molecular
