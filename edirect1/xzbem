BACKGROUND & AIMS: Age is frequently discussed as negative host factor to 
achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) to antiviral therapy of chronic 
hepatitis C. However, elderly patients often show advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis as 
known negative predictive factor. The aim of this study was to assess age as an 
independent predictive factor during antiviral therapy.
METHODS: Overall, 516 hepatitis C patients were treated with pegylated 
interferon-α and ribavirin, thereof 66 patients ≥60 years. We analysed the 
impact of host factors (age, gender, fibrosis, haemoglobin, previous hepatitis C 
treatment) and viral factors (genotype, viral load) on SVR per therapy course by 
performing a generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression modelling, a 
matched pair analysis and a classification tree analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, SVR per therapy course was 42.9 and 26.1%, respectively, in 
young and elderly patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1/4/6. The 
corresponding figures for HCV genotypes 2/3 were 74.4 and 84%. In the GEE model, 
age had no significant influence on achieving SVR. In matched pair analysis, SVR 
was not different in young and elderly patients (54.2 and 55.9% respectively; P 
= 0.795 in binominal test). In classification tree analysis, age was not a 
relevant splitting variable.
CONCLUSIONS: Age is not a significant predictive factor for achieving SVR, when 
relevant confounders are taken into account. As life expectancy in Western 
Europe at age 60 is more than 20 years, it is reasonable to treat chronic 
hepatitis C in selected elderly patients with relevant fibrosis or cirrhosis but 
without major concomitant diseases, as SVR improves survival and reduces 
carcinogenesis.

CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) is the process by which patients, together 
with their physician and loved ones, establish preferences for future care. 
Because previous research has shown that relatives play a considerable role in 
end-of-life care decisions, it is important to understand how family members are 
involved in this process.
OBJECTIVES: To gain understanding of the involvement of family members in ACP 
for older people near the end of life by exploring their views and experiences 
concerning this process.
METHODS: This was a qualitative research study, done with semistructured 
interviews. Twenty-one family members were recruited from three geriatric 
settings in Flanders, Belgium. The data were analyzed using the constant 
comparative method as proposed by the grounded theory.
RESULTS: Family members took different positions in the ACP process depending on 
how much responsibility the family member wanted to take and to what extent the 
family member felt the patient expected him/her to play a part. The position of 
family members on these two dimensions was influenced by several factors, namely 
acknowledgment of the imminent death, experiences with death and dying, opinion 
about the benefits of ACP, burden of initiating conversations about death and 
dying, and trust in health care providers. Furthermore, the role of family 
members in ACP was embedded in the existing relationship patterns.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the different positions of family 
members in the end-of-life care planning of older patients with a short life 
expectancy. It is important for health care providers to understand the position 
of a family member in the ACP of the patient, take into account that family 
members may experience an active role in ACP as burdensome, and consider 
existing relationship patterns.

BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) 
have therapeutic activity in different tumour types. We aimed to investigate the 
efficacy, safety, and immunological activity of the anti-CTLA4 monoclonal 
antibody, tremelimumab, in advanced malignant mesothelioma.
METHODS: In our open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients aged 
18 years or older with measurable, unresectable malignant mesothelioma and 
progressive disease after a first-line platinum-based regimen. Eligible patients 
had to have a life expectancy of 3 months or more, an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and no history of autoimmune 
disease. Patients received tremelimumab 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 90 
days until progressive disease or severe toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 
proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (complete or partial 
response), with a target response rate of 17% according to the modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for pleural malignant mesothelioma 
or standard RECIST 1.0 for peritoneal malignant mesothelioma. Analyses were done 
according to intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 
2008-005171-95, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01649024.
FINDINGS: Between May 27, 2009, and Jan 10, 2012, we enrolled 29 patients. All 
patients received at least one dose of tremelimumab (median two doses, range one 
to nine). No patients had a complete response and two patients (7%) had a 
durable partial response (one lasting 6 months and one lasting 18 months); one 
partial response occurred after initial progressive disease. Thus, the study did 
not reach its primary endpoint. However, we noted disease control in nine (31%) 
patients and a median progression-free survival of 6·2 months (95% CI 1·3-11·1) 
and a median overall survival of 10·7 months (0·0-21·9). 27 patients (93%) had 
at least one grade 1-2 treatment-emergent adverse event (mainly cutaneous rash, 
pruritus, colitis, or diarrhoea), and four patients (14%) had at least one grade 
3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event (two gastrointestinal, one neurological, 
two hepatic, and one pancreatic).
INTERPRETATION: Although the effect size was small in our phase 2 trial, 
tremelimumab seemed to have encouraging clinical activity and an acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile in previously treated patients with advanced 
malignant mesothelioma.

Affective temperaments and self-harm in adolescents: a cross-sectional study 
from a community sample.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent self-harm (SH) is a major health problem potentially 
associated with poor outcomes including reduced life expectancy and risk of 
completed suicide in adulthood. Several studies point to the role of possible 
constitutional vulnerabilities that could predispose to this behavior. This 
study sets out to assess the relationship between SH and affective temperaments 
(AT) in adolescents.
METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of public school students (n=1713), with age 
limits between 12 and 20, was examined using anonymously completed self-report 
instruments including 'The Lifestyle & Coping Questionnaire' and the 
'Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San 
Diego-auto-questionnaire' (TEMPS-A). SH was defined according to strict criteria 
through a two-stage procedure. Statistical significance of associations with SH 
for categorical variables was assessed in bivariate analysis. AT predictors of 
lifetime SH were examined in multivariate logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Lifetime SH was reported by 7.3%, being about three times more frequent 
in females. SH was associated, in both genders, with a significant deviation on 
depressive, cyclothymic and irritable dimensions of TEMPS-A. After multivariate 
logistic regression adjusted to family typology, smoking status, alcohol and 
drug consumption, only depressive temperament remained significantly associated 
as a predictor of SH in both genders.
LIMITATIONS: The use of self-rating instruments and the cross-sectional nature 
of the study limit our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclothymic, irritable and especially depressive temperament might 
represent an important marker of vulnerability to SH in both male and female 
adolescents.

Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. Electronic 
address: mariotta@mail.nih.gov.

OBJECTIVES: To provide cancer patients and clinicians with more accurate 
estimates of a patient's life expectancy with respect to noncancer mortality, we 
estimated comorbidity-adjusted life tables and health-adjusted age.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End 
Results-Medicare database, we estimated comorbidity scores that reflect the 
health status of people who are 66 years of age and older in the year before 
cancer diagnosis. Noncancer survival by comorbidity score was estimated for each 
age, race, and sex. Health-adjusted age was estimated by systematically 
comparing the noncancer survival models with US life tables.
RESULTS: Comorbidity, cancer status, sex, and race are all important predictors 
of noncancer survival; however, their relative impact on noncancer survival 
decreases as age increases. Survival models by comorbidity better predicted 
noncancer survival than the US life tables. The health-adjusted age and national 
life tables can be consulted to provide an approximate estimate of a person's 
life expectancy, for example, the health-adjusted age of a black man aged 75 
years with no comorbidities is 67 years, giving him a life expectancy of 13 
years.
CONCLUSION: The health-adjusted age and the life tables adjusted by age, race, 
sex, and comorbidity can provide important information to facilitate decision 
making about treatment for cancer and other conditions.

Catarina, Tubarão, SC, Brazil. Electronic address: jefferson.tarebert@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Despite the considerable epidemiological relevance of cancer in 
developing countries, there are very few studies of the burden related to 
cancer. The aim of this study was to present and discuss data from a 
burden-of-cancer study performed in a Southern Brazilian state.
METHODS: An epidemiological study of ecological design was performed to 
calculate the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) index. The study was based on 
records of individuals admitted and treated for cancer in the Brazilian National 
Health System Hospitals, or individuals who had died of cancer while residing in 
the state of Santa Catarina in 2008.
RESULTS: A total of 73,872.9 DALYs were estimated, which generated a rate of 
1220.5 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. The highest DALYs were those for cancer of the 
trachea, bronchus and lung with 179.0/100,000 inhabitants, gastric cancer with 
101.7/100,000 inhabitants, and breast cancer with 99.7/100,000 inhabitants. The 
percentage contribution of the DALY component varied according to cancer type; 
however, mortality was the major component in all types. The highest rates were 
observed in 60-69-year-olds with 6071.3/100,000 inhabitants, in 70-79-year-olds 
with 5095.4/100,000 inhabitants, and in 45-59-year-olds with 3189.0 DALY/100,000 
inhabitants; 53.7% of DALYs occurred in males.
CONCLUSIONS: The greatest burden of disease due to cancer in Santa Catarina was 
attributed to cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung, followed by gastric and 
breast cancers. The mortality component was responsible for the greatest burden.

BACKGROUND: Since indication extension to children data regarding the 
effectiveness of levetiracetam in paediatric patients remains limited.
AIMS: Investigate the real-life effectiveness of levetiracetam in paediatric 
patients.
METHODS: Epileptic children (<16 years) who had initiated levetiracetam between 
1 October 2006 and 31 March 2007 were included and followed for 1 year by 
hospital or non-hospital neurologists practising in France.
RESULTS: Among the 156 identified children, 147 were analysed: 51.7% were 
female, and mean (SD) age was 9.2 years (4.2). Most patients had either partial 
symptomatic (30.6%) or partial cryptogenic (26.5%) epilepsy, 92.5% experienced 
seizures during the 6 months preceding levetiracetam initiation, and 19.2% were 
on levetiracetam alone at initiation. One-year levetiracetam continuation rate 
was estimated to be 72.0% (95%CI [63.8; 78.6]). Of the 104 children continuing 
levetiracetam treatment at end of study, 31.7% were seizure-free during the last 
six months of follow-up, and 23.1% on levetiracetam alone. Discontinuation of 
levetiracetam (n = 41) was mainly for insufficient efficacy (58.5% of those 
concerned).
CONCLUSIONS: In real-life clinical practice important treatment retention and 
non-negligible reduction of seizure frequency may be expected.

Traditionally, epidemic processes have focused on establishing systems of 
differential-difference equations governing the number of individuals at each 
stage of the epidemic. Except for simple situations such as when transition 
rates are linear, these equations are notoriously intractable mathematically. In 
this work, the process is described as a compartmental model. The model also 
allows for individuals to go directly from any prior compartment directly to a 
final stage corresponding to death. This allows for the possibility that 
individuals can die earlier due to some non-disease related cause. Then, the 
model is based on waiting times in each compartment. Survival probabilities of 
moving from a given compartment to another compartment are established. While 
our approach can be used for general epidemic processes, our framework is for 
the HIV/AIDS process. It is then possible to establish the impact of the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic process on, e.g., insurance premiums and payouts and 
health-care costs. The effect of changing model parameter values on these 
entities is investigated.

Road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of increasing 
disability-adjusted life expectancy. We analyze long-term care needs associated 
with motor vehicle crash-related disability in Spain and conclude that needs 
attributable traffic injuries are most prevalent during victims' mid-life years, 
they create a significant burden for both families and society as a whole given 
that public welfare programmes supporting these victims need to be maintained 
over a long time frame. High socio-economic costs of road traffic accidents (in 
Spain 0.04% of the GDP in 2008) are clearly indicative of the need for 
governments and policymakers to strengthen road accident preventive measures.

Increased expression of Drosophila Sir2 extends life span in a dose-dependent 
manner.

Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family of protein acylases, deacetylates lysine 
residues within many proteins and is associated with lifespan extension in a 
variety of model organisms. Recent studies have questioned the positive effects 
of Sir2 on lifespan inDrosophila. Several studies have shown that increased 
expression of the Drosophila Sir2 homolog (dSir2) extends life span while other 
studies have reported no effect on life span or suggested that increased dSir2 
expression was cytotoxic. To attempt to reconcile the differences in these 
observed effects of dSir2 on Drosophila life span, we hypothesized that a 
critical level of dSir2 may be necessary to mediate life span extension. Using 
approaches that allow us to titrate dSir2 expression, we describe here a strong 
dose-dependent effect of dSir2 on life span. Using the two transgenic dSir2 
lines that were reported not to extend life span, we are able to show 
significant life span extension when dSir2 expression is induced between 2 and 
5-fold. However, higher levels decrease life span and can induce cellular 
toxicity, manifested by increased expression of the JNK-signaling molecule Puc 
phosphatase and induction of dnaJ-H. Our results help to resolve the apparently 
conflicting reports by demonstrating that the effects of increased dSir2 
expression on life span in Drosophila are dependent upon dSir2 dosage.

BACKGROUND: There are variations in quality of life (QoL) and reported risk of 
chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the improvement in pain and QoL after open inguinal hernia repair, 
and the economic impact.
METHODS: Patients undergoing open mesh repair of a primary unilateral inguinal 
hernia were stratified depending on preoperative levels of symptoms and pain. 
Short Form 36 (SF-36®) and EQ-5D™ questionnaires were filled in before, and at 3 
and 12 months after surgery. EQ-5D™ data, together with information on the mean 
value of a quality-adjusted life-year and the societal cost of hernia repair, 
were used to calculate the monetary value of QoL gained and the mean return on 
investment.
RESULTS: Of 225 patients who began the study, 184 completed follow-up at 12 
months. Some 77·2 per cent reported improvement in pain and 5·4 per cent 
reported increased pain after surgery. Significant improvement in SF-36® scores, 
pain scores measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), and symptoms were found 
in the majority of patients, even those with mild symptoms before surgery. For 
the whole group, the bodily pain score increased from 56·4 before surgery to 
82·6 at 12 months after hernia repair (P < 0·050), and the VAS score decreased 
from a median of 4 to 0 (P < 0·050). The return on investment was positive for 
all groups of patients, including those with mild symptoms.
CONCLUSION: QoL improves after open inguinal hernia repair, with a good return 
on investment independent of symptom severity.

A practical approach of pulmonary hypertension in the elderly.

Lador F(1), Herve P.

Universitaires de Genève, Suisse.

Recent reports from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) registries suggest 
that the mean age at diagnosis is increasing, outlining a growing proportion of 
elderly male patients. As a consequence, the classical description of the 
disease is shifting and may no more be described as a rare disease typically 
affecting young women. Potential explanations of this changing picture may 
include an aging of populations in western countries, the increase in life 
expectancy and the growing awareness of PAH and emergence of potential efficient 
treatments. Diagnostic workup of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the 
elderly should be performed in such a way as to discriminate between the 
expected consequences of aging, pulmonary vascular disease, and other frequent 
causes of secondary PH (left heart failure or lung disease). Careful exploration 
by right heart catheterization is mandatory, but special attention should be 
paid to several pitfalls specific to this procedure in this age group. This is a 
matter of concern as clinical trials that aim to study new specific drug therapy 
for PAH might be biased by the inclusion of misdiagnosed patients. The aim of 
this review is to highlight the main difficulties in diagnosing PAH in the 
elderly and to propose a practical approach to distinguish PAH from the other 
frequent causes of PH in this population.

Frequent mental distress (FMD) in Irish Travellers: discrimination and 
bereavement negatively influence mental health in the All Ireland Traveller 
Health Study.

Travellers are an indigenous minority group in Ireland, with poorer life 
expectancy and health status than the general population. Recent data have shown 
that Travellers are at increased risk of poor mental health and sequelae from 
same. We aimed to examine the associations between sociodemographic and 
lifestyle factors with poor mental health in Irish Travellers. A census survey 
of all Travellers was undertaken, with 8,492 enumerated families (80% response 
rate). A random subset of 1,796 adults completed an adult health survey. 
Traveller peer researchers employed a novel oral-visual computer-aided data 
collection tool. Frequent mental distress (FMD) was defined as 14 or more days 
of poor mental health in the preceding 1 month. Prevalence ratios for typical 
associates of FMD were estimated using a Poisson regression model, adjusted for 
age and sex. FMD was present in 11.9% of Traveller respondents, and prevalence 
increased with age. After age and sex adjustment, FMD was more prevalent in 
those whose quality of life was impaired by physical health, by those who were 
recently bereaved of a friend or family member, and by those who had greater 
experiences of discrimination. This study shows that Travellers experience 
discrimination and bereavement, which negatively influence their mental health. 
The findings have implications for the mental healthcare needs of indigenous 
ethnic minorities worldwide.

Estimating the loss in expectation of life due to cancer using flexible 
parametric survival models.

A useful summary measure for survival data is the expectation of life, which is 
calculated by obtaining the area under a survival curve. The loss in expectation 
of life due to a certain type of cancer is the difference between the 
expectation of life in the general population and the expectation of life among 
the cancer patients. This measure is used little in practice as its estimation 
generally requires extrapolation of both the expected and observed survival. A 
parametric distribution can be used for extrapolation of the observed survival, 
but it is difficult to find a distribution that captures the underlying shape of 
the survival function after the end of follow-up. In this paper, we base our 
extrapolation on relative survival, because it is more stable and reliable. 
Relative survival is defined as the observed survival divided by the expected 
survival, and the mortality analogue is excess mortality. Approaches have been 
suggested for extrapolation of relative survival within life-table data, by 
assuming that the excess mortality has reached zero (statistical cure) or has 
stabilized to a constant. We propose the use of flexible parametric survival 
models for relative survival, which enables estimating the loss in expectation 
of life on individual level data by making these assumptions or by extrapolating 
the estimated linear trend at the end of follow-up. We have evaluated the 
extrapolation from this model using data on four types of cancer, and the 
results agree well with observed data.

Twin Mitochondrial Sequence Analysis.

California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.

When applying genome-wide sequencing technologies to disease investigation, it 
is increasingly important to resolve sequence variation in regions of the genome 
that may have homologous sequences. The human mitochondrial genome challenges 
interpretation given the potential for heteroplasmy, somatic variation, and 
homologous nuclear mitochondrial sequences (numts). Identical twins share the 
same mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from early life, but whether the mitochondrial 
sequence remains similar is unclear. We compared an adult monozygotic twin pair 
using high throughput-sequencing and evaluated variants with primer extension 
and mitochondrial pre-enrichment. Thirty-seven variants were shared between the 
twin individuals, and the variants were verified on the original genomic DNA. 
These studies support highly identical genetic sequence in this case. Certain 
low-level variant calls were of high quality and homology to the mitochondrial 
DNA, and they were further evaluated. When we assessed calls in pre-enriched 
mitochondrial DNA templates, we found that these may represent numts, which can 
be differentiated from mtDNA variation. We conclude that twin identity extends 
to mitochondrial DNA, and it is critical to differentiate between numts and 
mtDNA in genome sequencing, particularly since significant heteroplasmy could 
influence genome interpretation. Further studies on mtDNA and numts will aid in 
understanding how variation occurs and persists.

Spouses' involvement in their partners' diabetes management: associations with 
spouse stress and perceived marital quality.

August KJ(1), Rook KS, Franks MM, Parris Stephens MA.

Author information:

Spouses frequently attempt to influence (control) or support their chronically 
ill partners' adherence behaviors. Studies have documented effects of spousal 
control and support on chronically ill individuals, but little is known about 
how these two forms of involvement in a partner's disease management may be 
associated with spouses' stress or the quality of their interactions with their 
ill partners. The current study sought to address this gap by examining spouses' 
day-to-day involvement in their marital partner's management of type 2 diabetes 
(n = 129). Multilevel analyses of daily diary data revealed that on days when 
spouses exerted control, they reported more stress and more tense marital 
interactions, although these associations were more pronounced when patients 
exhibited poor adherence, had been ill for a longer period of time, and had more 
comorbid health conditions. On days when spouses provided support, in contrast, 
they reported less stress and more enjoyable marital interactions. The findings 
from the current study suggest that spouses' day-to-day stress and quality of 
interactions with their partners are associated with spouses' involvement in 
their partners' disease management, with health-related social control and 
support exhibiting distinctive associations.

EVEREST II high risk study based UK cost-effectiveness analysis of MitraClip® in 
patients with severe mitral regurgitation ineligible for conventional 
repair/replacement surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip, an interventional 
procedure for patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation.
METHODS: A decision analytic model with a lifetime horizon was developed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip vs conventional medical management in 
patients with severe mitral regurgitation, ineligible for surgery. The analysis 
was performed from a UK NHS perspective and the estimates for mortality, adverse 
events, and cross-sectional NYHA class were obtained from the EVEREST II High 
Risk Study (HRS). Utility decrements were obtained from a heath technology 
assessment on Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, while unit costs were obtained 
from national databases. The concept model was clinically validated. Costs (2011 
£UK) and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.
RESULTS: Compared to medical management, over 2- and 10-year periods MitraClip 
had incremental Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains of 0.48 and 2.04, 
respectively. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios for MitraClip at 2 and 
10 years are £52,947 and £14,800 per QALY gained. Overall, the model was most 
sensitive to the choice of time horizon, the discount rate applied to benefits, 
the starting age of cohort, the utility decrement associated with NYHA II, and 
cost of the MitraClip procedure. The model was insensitive to changes in all 
other parameters. MitraClip was also found to be cost-effective, regardless of 
the modelling approach, and insensitive to the key assumptions of the procedure 
cost.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: The primary limitation of the analysis is the reliance on 
aggregate data from a modestly sized non-randomized study with a short-term 
follow-up period. Aligned to this was the need to extrapolate survival well 
beyond the study period in order to generate meaningful results. The impact of 
both of these limitations was explored via extensive sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Compared to medical management, MitraClip is a cost-effective 
interventional procedure at conventional threshold values.

Preventing and lessening exacerbations of asthma in school-age children 
associated with a new term (PLEASANT): study protocol for a cluster randomised 
control trial.

BACKGROUND: Within the UK, during September, there is a pronounced increase in 
the number of unscheduled medical contacts by school-aged children (4-16 years) 
with asthma. It is thought that that this might be caused by the return back to 
school after the summer holidays, suddenly mixing with other children again and 
picking up viruses which could affect their asthma. There is also a drop in the 
number of prescriptions administered in August. It is possible therefore that 
children might not be taking their medication as they should during the summer 
contributing to them becoming ill when they return to school.It is hoped that a 
simple intervention from the GP to parents of children with asthma at the start 
of the summer holiday period, highlighting the importance of maintaining asthma 
medication can help prevent increased asthma exacerbation, and unscheduled NHS 
appointments, following return to school in September.
METHODS/DESIGN: PLEASANT is a cluster randomised trial. A total of 140 General 
Practices (GPs) will be recruited into the trial; 70 GPs randomised to the 
intervention and 70 control practices of "usual care". An average practice is 
expected to have approximately 100 children (aged 4-16 with a diagnosis of 
asthma) hence observational data will be collected on around 14000 children over 
a 24-month period. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will collect all data 
required for the study which includes diagnostic, prescription and referral 
data.
DISCUSSION: The trial will assess whether the intervention can reduce 
exacerbation of asthma and unscheduled medical contacts in school-aged children 
associated with the return to school after the summer holidays. It has the 
potential to benefit the health and quality of life of children with asthma 
while also improving the effectiveness of NHS services by reducing NHS use in 
one of the busiest months of the year.An exploratory health economic analysis 
will gauge any cost saving associated with the intervention and subsequent 
impacts on quality of life. If results for the intervention are positive it is 
hoped that this could be adopted as part of routine care management of childhood 
asthma in general practice.

Health and Social Care Management (CeRGAS). Electronic address:

OBJECTIVES: In the Italian health care system, genetic tests for factor V Leiden 
and factor II are routinely prescribed to assess the predisposition to venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) of women who request oral contraception. With specific 
reference to two subpopulations of women already at risk (i.e., familial history 
or previous event of VTE), the study aimed to assess whether current screening 
practices in Italy are cost-effective.
METHODS: Two decisional models accrued costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY) annually from the perspective of the National Health Service. The two 
models were derived from a decision analysis exercise concerning testing 
practices and consequent prescribing behavior for oral contraception conducted 
with 250 Italian gynecologists. Health care costs were compiled on the basis of 
10-year hospital discharge records and the activities of a thrombosis center. 
Whenever possible, input data were based on the Italian context; otherwise, the 
data were taken from the international literature.
RESULTS: Current testing practices on women with a familial history of VTE 
generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €72,412/QALY, which is well 
above the acceptable threshold of cost-effectiveness of €40,000 to €50,000/QALY. 
In the case of women with a previous event of VTE, the most frequently used 
testing strategy is cost-ineffective and leads to an overall loss of QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first attempt to conduct a cost-utility 
analysis of genetic screening practices for the predisposition to VTE in the 
Italian setting. The results indicate that there is an urgent need to better 
monitor the indications for which tests for factor V Leiden and factor II are 
prescribed.

Israel. Electronic address: amirsh@ekmd.huji.ac.il.

OBJECTIVE: Reduced mortality with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung 
cancer screening was demonstrated in a large randomized controlled study of 
high-risk individuals. Cost-effectiveness must be assessed before routine LDCT 
screening is considered. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT 
lung cancer screening in Israel.
METHODS: A decision analytic framework was used to evaluate the decision to 
screen or not screen from the health system perspective. The screening arm 
included 842 moderate-to-heavy smokers aged 45 years or older, screened at 
Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center from 1998 to 2004. In the usual-care 
arm, stage distribution and stage-specific life expectancy were obtained from 
the Israel National Cancer Registry data for 1994 to 2006. Lifetime 
stage-specific costs were estimated from medical records of patients diagnosed 
and treated at Hadassah Medical Center in the period 2003 to 2004. The analysis 
considered possible biases-lead time, overdiagnosis, and self-selection. Cost 
per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained by screening was estimated.
RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost per QALY gained was $1464 (2011 prices). 
Extensive sensitivity analysis affirmed the low cost per QALY gained. The cost 
per QALY gained is lower than $10,000 with probability 0.937 and is lower than 
$20,000 with probability 0.978.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that baseline LDCT lung cancer screening in 
Israel presents a good value for the money and should be considered for 
inclusion in the National List of Health Services financed publicly.

BACKGROUND: Every Woman Counts (EWC), a California breast cancer screening 
program, faced challenging budget cutbacks and policy choices.
METHODS: A microsimulation model evaluated costs, outcomes, and 
cost-effectiveness of EWC program mammography policy options on coverage for 
digital mammography (which has a higher cost than film mammography but recent 
legislation allowed reimbursement at the lower film rate); screening eligibility 
age; and screening frequency. Model inputs were based on analyses of program 
claims data linked to California Cancer Registry data, Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results data, and the Medi-Cal literature. Outcomes 
included number of procedures, cancers, cancer deaths, costs, and incremental 
cost per life-year.
RESULTS: Projected model outcomes matched program data closely. With 
restrictions on the number of clients screened, strategies starting screening at 
age 40 years were dominated (not cost-effective). This finding was highly robust 
in sensitivity analyses. Compared with no screening, biennial film mammography 
for women aged 50 to 64 years was projected to reduce 15-year breast cancer 
mortality by nearly 7.8% at $18,999 per additional life-year, annual film 
mammography was $106,428 per additional life-year, and digital mammography 
$180,333 per additional life-year. This more effective, more expensive strategy 
was projected to reduce breast cancer mortality by 8.6%. Under equal mammography 
reimbursement, biennial digital mammography beginning at age 50 years was 
projected to decrease 15-year breast cancer mortality by 8.6% at an incremental 
cost per additional life-year of $17,050.
CONCLUSIONS: For the EWC program, biennial screening mammography starting at age 
50 years was the most cost-effective strategy. The impact of digital mammography 
on life expectancy was small. Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis can 
be completed in a policy-relevant time frame to assist policymakers faced with 
difficult program choices.

Cost-utility of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing compared to conventional total 
hip replacement in young active patients with osteoarthritis.

Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MoM HRA) has emerged as 
an alternative to total hip arthroplasty (THA) for younger active patients with 
osteoarthritis (OA). Birmingham hip resurfacing is the most common MoM HRA in 
Alberta, and is therefore compared with conventional THA.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost-utility 
of MoM HRA versus THA, in younger patients with OA, using a decision analytic 
model with a 15-year time horizon.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision analytic model was constructed to 
estimate the expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of MoM HRA 
versus THA from a health care payer perspective. The base case considered 
patients with OA aged 50 years; men comprised 65.9% of the cohort. Sensitivity 
analyses evaluated cohort age, utility values, failure probabilities, and 
treatment costs. Data were derived from the Hip Improvement Project and the Hip 
and Knee Replacement Pilot databases in Alberta, the 2010 National Joint 
Replacement Registry of the Australian Orthopaedic Association, and the 
literature.
RESULTS: In the base case, THA was dominated by MoM HRA (incremental mean costs 
of -$583 and incremental mean QALYs of 0.079). In subgroup analyses, THA 
remained dominated when cohort age was 40 years instead of 50 years or when only 
men were assessed. THA dominated when the cohort age was 60 years or when only 
women were assessed. Results were sensitive to utilities, surgery costs, and MoM 
HRA revision and conversion probabilities. At a willingness-to-pay of Can 
$50,000/QALY, there was a 58% probability that MoM HRA is cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that, on average, MoM HRA was preferred to THA for 
younger and male patients, but THA is still a reasonable option if the patient 
or clinician prefers given the small absolute differences between the options 
and the confidence ellipses around the cost-effectiveness estimates.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor after one 
previous cesarean (TOLAC) when incorporating long-term events and outcomes.
METHODS: A Markov model comparing TOLAC with elective repeat cesarean delivery 
(ERCD) was developed for a hypothetical cohort with no contraindication to a 
TOLAC. Women were selected from a prospective study to derive probability 
estimates for potential events through three subsequent pregnancies. 
Probabilities for cerebral palsy and stress urinary incontinence, cost data, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were obtained from the literature. The 
primary outcome was cost-effectiveness measured as the marginal cost per QALY 
gained, with a $50,000 threshold per QALY used to define cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The TOLAC strategy dominated the ERCD strategy at baseline, with $164.2 
million saved and 500 QALYs gained per 100,000 women. The model was sensitive to 
six variables: the probability of uterine rupture and successful TOLAC among 
women with no prior vaginal delivery, the frequency of stress urinary 
incontinence, and the costs of failed TOLAC, successful TOLAC, and ERCD. When 
the probability of TOLAC success was at the base value, 67.2%, TOLAC was 
preferred if the probability of uterine rupture was 3.1% or less. When the 
probability of uterine rupture was at the base value, 0.8%, the TOLAC strategy 
was preferred as long as the probability of success was 47.2% or more. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Under baseline circumstances, TOLAC is less expensive and more 
effective than an ERCD when considering long-term consequences when the 
likelihood of success is 47.2% or more.
