BACKGROUND: It is not well understood why one in five patients report poor 
outcomes following knee arthroplasty. This study evaluated changes in knee 
biomechanics, and perceived pain among patients reporting either a good or a 
poor outcome in knee-related quality of life after total knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 66 (SD 7) years) were included in this 
prospective study. Within one month of knee arthroplasty and one year after 
surgery, patients underwent three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis, completed the 
Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and rated perceived pain 
using a visual analogue scale. A "good outcome" was defined as a change greater 
than the minimally detectable change in the KOOS knee-related quality of life, 
and a "poor outcome" was defined as change below the minimally detectable 
change. Nineteen patients (68%) were classified as having a good outcome. Groups 
were analyzed separately and knee biomechanics were compared using a two-way 
repeated measures ANOVA. Differences in pain between groups were evaluated using 
Mann Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Patients classified as having a good outcome improved significantly in 
most knee gait biomechanical outcomes including increased knee flexion-extension 
range, reduced peak varus angle, increased peak flexion moment, and reduced peak 
valgus moment. The good outcome group also displayed a significant increase in 
walking speed, a reduction (normalization) of stance phase duration (% of gait 
cycle) and increased passive knee extension. Whereas, the only change in knee 
biomechanics, one year after surgery, for patients classified as having a poor 
outcome was a significant reduction in peak varus angle. No differences in pain 
postoperatively were found between groups.
CONCLUSION: Patients reporting a good outcome in knee-related quality of life 
improved in knee biomechanics during gait, while patients reporting a poor 
outcome, despite similar reduction in pain, remained unchanged in knee 
biomechanics one year after total knee arthroplasty. With regards to 
surgeon-controlled biomechanical factors, surgery may most successfully address 
frontal plane knee alignment. However, achieving a good outcome in 
patient-reported knee-related quality of life may be related to dynamic 
improvements in the sagittal plane.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, a broad range of dietary restriction regimens extend 
life span to different degrees by separate or partially overlapping molecular 
pathways. One of these regimens, axenic dietary restriction, doubles the worm's 
life span but currently, almost nothing is known about the underlying molecular 
mechanism. Previous studies suggest that mitochondrial stress responses such as 
the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) or mitohormesis may play a 
vital role in axenic dietary restriction-induced longevity. Here, we provide 
solid evidence that axenic dietary restriction treatment specifically induces an 
UPRmt response in C elegans but this induction is not required for axenic 
dietary restriction-mediated longevity. We also show that reactive oxygen 
species-mediated mitohormesis is not involved in this phenotype. Hence, changes 
in mitochondrial physiology and induction of a mitochondrial stress response are 
not necessarily causal to large increases in life span.

OBJECTIVES: Freedom Solo (FS) is a pericardial stentless heart valve showing 
excellent haemodynamic performance at mid-term. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the long-term performance of such bioprostheses.
METHODS: Between December 2004 and November 2009, 109 patients (31 men; mean age 
76 ± 6 years) underwent aortic valve replacement with FS. Preoperatively, the 
mean NYHA class was 2.5 ± 0.7, the mean EuroSCORE II, 2.8 ± 2.5. Mean prosthesis 
size was 22.7 ± 1.9 mm; concomitant procedures were performed in 65 patients. 
Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was diagnosed according to the Valve 
Academic Research Consortium-2 definition.
RESULTS: Two patients (1.8%) died within 30 days. Follow-up (72 ± 36 months) was 
100% completed. The 1-, 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 89, 73 and 
42%, respectively, with 8 valve-related deaths; the actuarial freedom from SVD 
was 99, 93 and 76%. During 61 ± 39 months of follow-up, echocardiographic 
findings worsened progressively: At discharge, 3-5 and 7-9 years, the mean 
gradient was 8 ± 4, 12 ± 11 and 19 ± 19 mmHg ( P  < 0.01); the indexed effective 
orifice area was 1.0 ± 0.2, 0.9 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.3 cm 2 /m 2 ( P  < 0.01). Of 
the 13 patients who developed SVD, it was due to aortic stenosis in 11. SVD was 
a predictor of cardiovascular mortality at univariate analysis (HR 2.87, 
1.12-7.29); 2 explanted prostheses showed massive calcium deposits with mean 
calcium and phosphorus contents of 234 ± 16 and 116 ± 7 mg/g dry weight, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The FS bioprosthesis shows excellent mid-term clinical and 
haemodynamic results and offers an alternative to other valves, particularly in 
the case of a small aortic annulus. Worsening of FS performance was observed at 
late follow-up because of progressive SVD with stenosis, questioning whether it 
should be used in patients with a long life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated racial disparity in life expectancies (LEs) 
and life years lost (LYL) associated with multiple obesity-related chronic 
conditions (OCCs).
METHODS: Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2008-2012, were used. 
Four OCCs were studied: diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), 
and stroke. LE for each subpopulation was simulated by Markov modelling. LYL 
associated with a disease for a subpopulation was computed by taking the 
difference between LEs for members of that subpopulation without disease and LEs 
for members of that subpopulation who had that disease. Racial disparities were 
measured in the absolute differences in LE and LYL between black women/men and 
white women/men.
RESULTS: Black individuals had higher risks of developing diabetes, 
hypertension, and stroke. This disparity in LE between white and black 
participants was largest in men age 40 to 49 with at least stroke: black men 
lived 3.12 years shorter than white men. The disparity in LYL between white and 
black participants was largest in women age 70 to 79 with at least CHD: black 
women had 1.98 years more LYL than white women.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparity exists in incident disease and mortality risks, 
LEs, and LYL associated with multiple OCCs. Efforts targeting subpopulations 
with large disparities are required to reduce disparities in the burden of 
multiple OCCs.

Objective: To understand the associations between extremely low and high air 
temperature and the years of life lost (YLL) due to diabetes deaths in Chongqing 
and Harbin with different climatic characteristics in China. Methods: A double 
threshold B-spline distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to 
investigate the lag and cumulative effects of extremely low and high air 
temperature on YLL due to diabetes for lag 0-30 days by using the urban 
meteorological and diabetes mortality data of Chongqing (2011-2013) and Harbin 
(2008-2010). The effects were expressed as relative risk (RR). Results: In 
Chongqing, the cold effects on YLL due to diabetes were delayed by four days and 
lasted for three days (lag4-6) with the highest RR of 1.304 (95%CI:1.033-1.647) 
at lag5. The hot effects were delayed by one day (lag1) with RR of 1.321 
(95%CI:1.061-1.646). In Harbin, the extreme cold effects on YLL were delayed by 
four days and lasted for seven days (lag4-10) with the highest RR of 1.309 
(95%CI: 1.088-1.575) at lag6. The hot effects were delayed by one day and lasted 
for four days (lag1-4) with the highest RR of 1.460 (95%CI:1.114-1.915) at lag2. 
The unit risk for cold and hot effects was 43.7% (P=0.005 5) and 18.0% (P=0.000 
2) in Chongqing and 15.0% (P=0.000 8) and 29.5% (P=0.001 2) in Harbin, 
respectively. Conclusions: Both extremely low air temperature and extremely high 
air temperature might increase the years of life lost due to diabetes in cities 
with different climate characteristics. Health education about diabetes 
prevention should provide information about the effects of extreme weather 
events.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the income gaps associated with self-rated poor health at 
the district level in Korea and to identify the geographical correlations 
between self-rated poor health, life expectancy, and the associated income gaps.
METHODS: We analyzed data for 1,578,189 participants from the Community Health 
Survey of Korea collected between 2008 and 2014. The age-standardized prevalence 
of self-rated poor health and the associated income gaps were calculated. 
Previously released data on life expectancy and the associated income gaps were 
also used. We performed correlation and regression analyses for self-rated poor 
health, life expectancy, and associated income gaps.
RESULTS: Across 245 districts, the median prevalence of self-rated poor health 
was 15.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.6 to 16.8%), with interquartile 
range (IQR) of 3.1 percentage points (%p). The median interquintile gaps in the 
prevalence of self-rated poor health was 11.1%p (95% CI, 8.1 to 14.5%p), with 
IQR of 3.6%p. Pro-rich inequalities in self-rated health were observed across 
all 245 districts of Korea. The correlation coefficients for the association 
between self-rated poor health and the associated income gaps, self-rated poor 
health and life expectancy, and income gaps associated with self-rated poor 
health and life expectancy were 0.59, 0.78 and 0.55 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Income gaps associated with self-rated poor health were evident 
across all districts in Korea. The magnitude of income gaps associated with 
self-rated poor health was larger in the districts with greater prevalence of 
self-rated poor health. A strong correlation between self-rated poor health and 
life expectancy was also observed.

INTRODUCTION: Osteochemonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a chronic ischemic bone 
exposure. It has an increasing incidence. ONJ is mainly related to 
bisphosphonate and denosumab therapies in oncologic settings. Healing is 
considered uncertain ad as occurring slowly. International recommendations 
suggest to treat ONJ symptomatically in a first attempt. A surgical procedure, 
potentially aggressive, should be carefully weight up in patients in poor 
condition and whose life expectancy is often limited. However, surgical 
treatment seems to allow for a high rate of clinical remission. Postoperative 
remission periods, when mentioned in the studies, are disparate. The aim of our 
study was to clarify the remission period of ONJ after surgical management.
METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted on all patients operated for an ONJ 
at stage 2 and 3 in the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial 
Surgery - University Hospital of Besançon (France) from January 2006 to 
September 2015. Healing was defined as complete mucosal closure and asymptomatic 
site. Stage of the disease, the number and the type of surgery and the time 
between the last operation and the healing was noticed. These data were compared 
to an exhaustive review of the literature on PubMed with the following 
key-words: "osteonecrosis" AND "jaw" AND "surgery" AND "management". Only the 
articles giving the healing period were included.
RESULTS: Regarding the single-center retrospective study, the files of 
23 patients could be included. Fifteen percent of the patients benefited from 
several procedures under general anesthesia. Twenty percent had a stage 3 ONJ 
and 80 % had a stage 2 ONJ. Twenty-five interventions were performed on 23 sites 
in 20 patients. Immediate healing after surgery occurred in 35 % of the 
patients. At 6 months after surgery, 57 % of the treated areas were healed. 
Twenty percent of the patients had died. The healing rate did not improve 
further after 6 months postoperatively. Regarding the review of the literature, 
7 articles could be included. The mean postoperative healing period was 60.7 % 
at 6 months, 71.1 % at 12 months and 69.5 % at 18 months.
DISCUSSION: Our study shows that the postoperative healing rate of ONJ lies 
between 57 and 66.7 % at 6 months and that this rate was optimized in the order 
of 10 % to 12months and stable at 18months postoperatively. The ONJ of our 
series were partially or fully linked to other drugs than bisphosphonates in 
70 % of the cases: 50 % were related to denosumab, alone or in combination and 
35 % were related to an association with antiangiogenics, bevacizumab mainly.

BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the gold standard for clinically 
localized prostate cancer (PCa) patients with life expectancy (LE) of at least 
10 years. We examined long-term survival of men aged 80 years or older treated 
with RP and we attempted to identify criteria based on age and comorbidities 
that could predict survival of at least 10 years after RP, to identify those 
that might be considered for RP.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER)-Medicare-linked database, we identified 234 octo- and nonagenarians with 
clinical T1, T2 or T3 PCa treated with RP between 1991 and 2009. Kaplan-Meier 
analyses examined 10-year survival patterns. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses focused on the combined effect of age and/or Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI) after adjusting for different confounders.
RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival (OS) and cancer specific mortality (CSM) 
rates in the overall population were 51 and 9.9%. In individuals aged 80-81 
years old, the 10-year OS was 62.4 vs. 39.6% in older patients (p = 0.001). 
Moreover, combination of age 80-81 with CCI = 0 yielded 10-year OS of 67.9 vs. 
28.5% in older and sicker patients (p < 0.001). Age 80-81, absence of 
comorbidities and the combination of age 80-81 with CCI = 0, represented 
independent predictors of lower overall mortality (all p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Two out of three individuals selected for RP aged 80-81 years and 
without comorbidities, fulfill the criterion of LE of 10 years or more. 
Therefore, elderly PCa individuals can be suitable for surgical management, if 
appropriately selected, based on LE criterion.

BACKGROUND: Falls remain common for community-dwelling older people and impose a 
substantial economic burden to the healthcare system. RESPOND is a novel falls 
prevention programme that aims to reduce secondary falls and fall injuries among 
older people who present to a hospital emergency department (ED) with a fall. 
The present protocol describes a prospective economic evaluation examining the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of the RESPOND programme, compared with usual 
care practice, from the Australian health system perspective.
METHODS AND DESIGN: This economic evaluation will recruit 528 participants from 
two major tertiary hospital EDs in Australia and will be undertaken alongside a 
multisite randomised controlled trial. Outcome and costing data will be 
collected for all participants over the 12-month trial. It will compare the 
RESPOND falls prevention programme with usual care practice (current 
community-based falls prevention practices) to determine its incremental 
cost-effectiveness according to three intermediate clinical outcomes: (1) falls 
prevented, (2) fall injuries prevented and (3) injurious falls prevented. In 
addition, utilities will be derived from a generic quality-of-life measure 
(EQ-5D-5L) and used to calculate the 'incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
years gained'.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide healthcare decision makers 
with evidence to assist with setting spending thresholds for preventive health 
programmes and inform selection of emergency and community service models of 
care.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The protocol for this study is registered with the 
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000336684);

BACKGROUND: Characteristics of a cancer-positive margin around a resected 
uncinate process of the pancreas (MUP) due to a pancreticoduodenectomy are 
difficult to understand by standardized evaluation because of its complex 
anatomy. The purposes of this study were to subclassify the MUP with tissue 
marking dyes of different colors and to identify the characteristics of sites 
that showed positivity for cancer cells in patients with pancreatic head 
carcinoma who underwent circumferential superior mesenteric arterial nerve 
plexus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Results of this evaluation were used 
to review operation procedures and perioperative methods.
METHOD: We divided the MUP into 4 sections and stained each section with a 
different color. These sections were the pancreatic head nerve plexus margin 
(Area A), portal vein groove margin (Area B), superior mesenteric artery margin 
(Area C), and left of the superior mesenteric artery margin (Area D). The 
subjects evaluated were 45 patients who had carcinoma of the pancreatic head and 
were treated with circumferential superior mesenteric arterial nerve 
plexus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.
RESULTS: Of the 45 patients, nine cases (90%) of incomplete resection showed 
cancer-positivity in the MUP. Among the 4 sections of the MUP, the most cases of 
positive results [MUP (+) ] were found in Area B, with Area A (+), 0 case; Area 
B (+), 6 cases; Area C (+), 2 cases; and Area D (+), 3 cases (total, 11 sites in 
9 patients). Relapse occurred in 7 of the 9 patients with MUP (+). Local 
recurrence was observed as initial relapse in all 3 patients with Area D (+). In 
contrast, the most common site of recurrence other than that in patients with 
Area D (+) was the liver.
CONCLUSION: By subclassifying the MUP with tissue marking dyes of different 
colors, we could confirm regional characteristics of MUP (+). As a result, 
circumferential superior mesenteric arterial nerve plexus-preserving 
pancreticoduodenectomy was able to be performed in R0 operations in selected 
patients while a better postoperative quality of life was maintained. 
Furthermore, Area D (+) represents an extension beyond the limit of the local 
disease and may indicate the need for early aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and the growing phenomenon of aging can 
lead to increased burden of chronic diseases (CDs) which adversely affects the 
overall health of elderly, their sexuality in particular. Sexual life of an aged 
population is overlooked in many of the societies. In the present narrative 
review, we aim to assess the impact of CDs on sexual function of elderly people.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used internet databases including PubMed, EMBASE, ISI 
Web of Science, Google Scholar, SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, IPPF, and UNFPA 
without time limit. Ninety-eight out of 174 relevant articles were selected 
which met the inclusion criteria: those articles were research-based in English 
or Persian (original or review articles) and textbooks; specified one or more 
CDs and sexual function of the cases; elderly people over the age of sixty, men 
and women; and coordination between articles and research goals. We excluded 
qualitative and case studies. We reported the most related CDs with sexual 
function in literature review and used the biological and psychological impact 
of the CDs on sexual function of elderly population based on the conceptual 
model of Verschuren et al. (2010).
RESULTS: The results of the studies were classified into the themes including 
physical, psychological, and cultural and social. Diabetes, cardiovascular, 
cancerous, and chronic respiratory diseases and also some medications can reduce 
sexual capacity and desire in particular resulting in negative impact on the 
quality of elderly sexual life. CDs may influence sexual expressions and 
responses which adversely affect one's mood and energy so that can cause 
depression and grief, as well as loss of self-confidence, self-esteem, and 
self-concept in elderly adults. The factors affecting sexuality of an elderly 
with CDs include cultural and mythical beliefs about age and illnesses, fear, 
and embarrass of changed physical appearance. The research conducted among 
elderly population examining the adverse influence of CDs on aged people's 
sexual life in general, sexual function and performance, and intimate 
interaction.
CONCLUSION: It is considered that programs on sexual health needs of aged 
population for the health-care workers can prove beneficial in improving sexual 
health.

The use of models in nursing provides nurses to focus on the role of nursing and 
its applications rather than medical practice. In addition, it helps patient 
care to be systematic, purposeful, controlled and effective. One of the commonly 
used models in nursing is Roy Adaptation Model. According to Roy adaptation 
model, the aim of nursing is to increase compliance and life expectancy. Roy 
Adaptation Model evaluates the patient in physiologic mode, self-concept mode, 
role function mode and interdependence mode aiming to provide holistic care. 
This article describes the use of Roy Adaptation Model in the care of a patient 
who has been diagnosed with breast cancer and had breast-conserving surgery. 
Patient data was evaluated in the four modes of Roy adaptation model 
(physiologic, self-concept, role function, and interdependence modes) and the 
nursing process was applied.

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been the 
leading cause of death in the world. Ischemic heart diseases (IHDs) are the main 
form of CVDs and are the most important single cause of death around the world. 
This study aimed to estimate the burden of IHDs in the city of Isfahan by 
calculating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: This population-based study was conducted on the population living in 
the city of Isfahan in 2014. Years of life lost due to premature mortality 
(YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths due to IHDs (that was 
collected from death registration system (DRS) and was adjusted for 
incompleteness and misclassification) with life expectancy (that was extracted 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study (GBD) 
2013). Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying the 
prevalent cases of IHDs in each age-sex group (that was calculated using the 
stepwise approach to non-communicable disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS)) 
with total disability weight of IHDs (that was calculated using the GBD 2013). 
DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
RESULTS: In 2014, the number of DALYs due to IHDs was 43517.71 years which was 
formed of 31891.79 years of YLLs and 11625.92 years of YLDs. The rate of DALYs 
due to IHDs was 4412.33 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 3636.70-5162.72) 
person-years per 100,000 persons in males and 3476.66 (95% UI: 2948.95-4010.51) 
person-years per 100,000 persons in females. The highest rates of YLLs, YLDs, 
and DALYs due to IHDs in both sexes were occurred in 80 years and older.
CONCLUSIONS: The highest proportion of the burden of IHDs in the city of Isfahan 
was attributed to YLLs in the elderly people. Since the majority of the 
population of Isfahan is <60 years old and IHDs are long-lasting, the health 
authorities are recommended to design and implement educational and cultural 
programs to inform people about the risk factors and the methods to prevent 
these diseases. These programs can be used as a strategy to reduce the incidence 
of IHDs from an early age.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy for people with spinal cord injury has shown a 
marked increase due to modern advances in treatment methods and in 
neuro-urology. However, since life expectancy of people with paralysis 
increases, the risk of developing of urinary bladder cancer is gaining 
importance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-centre retrospective evaluation of patient data 
with spinal cord injuries and proven urinary bladder cancer and summary of the 
literature.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2014, 24 (3 female, 21 male) out of a total of 6599 
patients with spinal cord injury were diagnosed with bladder cancer. The average 
age at bladder cancer diagnosis was 57.67 years, which is well below the average 
for bladder cancer cases in the general population (male: 73, female: 77). All 
but one patient had a latency period between the onset of the spinal paralysis 
and tumour diagnosis of more than 10 years. The median latency was 29.83 years. 
The median survival for these patients was 11.5 months. Of the 24 patients, 19 
(79%) had muscle invasive bladder cancer at ≥T2 at the time of diagnosis. The 
type of neurogenic bladder (neurogenic detrusor overactivity or acontractility) 
and the form of bladder drainage do not appear to influence the risk. Long-term 
indwelling catheter drainage played only a minor role in the investigated 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The significantly younger age at onset and the frequency of 
invasive tumours at diagnosis indicate that spinal cord injury influences 
bladder cancer risk and prognosis as well. Early detection of bladder cancer in 
patients with spinal cord injury remains a challenge.

Population aging is accompanied by the burden of chronic diseases and 
disability. Chronic diseases are among the main causes of disability, which is 
associated with poor quality of life and high health care costs in the elderly. 
The identification of which chronic diseases contribute most to the disability 
prevalence is important to reduce the burden. Although longitudinal studies can 
be considered the gold standard to assess the causes of disability, they are 
costly and often with restricted sample size. Thus, the use of cross-sectional 
data under certain assumptions has become a popular alternative. Among the 
existing methods based on cross-sectional data, the attribution method, which 
was originally developed for binary disability outcomes, is an attractive 
option, as it enables the partition of disability into the additive contribution 
of chronic diseases, taking into account multimorbidity and that disability can 
be present even in the absence of disease. In this paper, we propose an 
extension of the attribution method to multinomial responses, since disability 
is often measured as a multicategory variable in most surveys, representing 
different severity levels. The R function constrOptim is used to maximize the 
multinomial log-likelihood function subject to a linear inequality constraint. 
Our simulation study indicates overall good performance of the model, without 
convergence problems. However, the model must be used with care for populations 
with low marginal disability probabilities and with high sum of conditional 
probabilities, especially with small sample size. For illustration, we apply the 
model to the data of the Belgian Health Interview Surveys.

angiotensin II receptor blockers as first-line treatment in autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a rare 
kidney disorder impacting ∼1:2,500 individuals among the general US population. 
Hypertension is a significant predictor of ADPKD progression, and a risk factor 
for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause for 
mortality among ADPKD patients. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors 
(ACE-I) are widely used as first-line treatment in ADPKD for the management of 
hypertension. However, their cost-effectiveness relative to other hypertensive 
medications, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), has never been 
assessed.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if ARB are more cost-effective than ACE-Is as first-line 
treatment in ADPKD.
METHODS: A Markov-state decision model was constructed for estimation of cost 
and outcome benefits in hypertensive ADPKD patients. Transition probabilities 
were extrapolated from a retrospective cohort study comparing chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stage transitions in ADPKD patients. Annual pharmaceutical costs 
per average daily dose per CKD stage were extracted from a US healthcare claims 
database. Median total healthcare costs per CKD stage or transplant were 
extracted from the published literature. The time horizon was set to 30 years, 
with 1-year duration to cycle shift. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted 
to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACE-I vs ARB per 
additional year of prevented transplant and/or death. A one-way probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was conducted, with 10% variation in probabilities and 
cost.
RESULTS: Total annual healthcare costs accrued after 30 years among ADPKD 
patients taking ACE-Is was estimated to be $3,505,028.41, compared to ARB at 
$3,644,327.65. Life expectancy was increased by 1.39 years among patients taking 
ACE-I. Approximate 10-year survival in patients taking ACE-Is was 47% compared 
to ARB at 34%.
CONCLUSIONS: ACE-I dominated ARB and displayed greater cost-effectiveness due to 
lower cost and increased capacity to prolong years of life without transplant or 
death among hypertensive ADPKD patients. This model strengthens the value of 
ACE-I over ARB as first-line treatment for hypertension management in ADPKD 
patients.

Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) targeting drugs provide an 
important option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with this 
distinct tumor type; however, there is considerable uncertainty as to which drug 
provides the optimal value after crizotinib treatment. This study estimated the 
cost-utility of alectinib vs ceritinib from a US payer perspective. Methods A 
cost-utility model was developed using partition survival methods and three 
health states: progression-free (PF), post-progression (PP), and death. Survival 
data were derived from the key clinical trials (alectinib: NP28761 & NP28673, 
ceritinib: ASCEND I and II). Costs included drugs, adverse events, and 
supportive care. Utilities were based on trial data and the literature. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess parameter 
uncertainty. Results Treatment with alectinib vs ceritinib resulted in increases 
of 2.55 months in the PF state, 0.44 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
$13,868, yielding a mean cost/QALY of $31,180. In the PSA, alectinib had a 96% 
probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. 
Drivers of model results were drug costs and utilities in the PF health state. 
The ICER ranged from $10,600-$65,000 per QALY in scenario analyses, including a 
sub-group analysis limited to patients with prior chemotherapy and crizotinib 
treatment. Conclusions Treatment with alectinib in ALK + crizotinib-treated 
patients increased time progression-free and QALYs vs ceritinib. The marginal 
cost increase was driven by longer treatment durations with alectinib. This 
model demonstrates that alectinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment 
after progression on crizotinib.

We report a case of a 56-year-old male patient with a life-threatening left 
common femoral artery bleeding due to tumor erosion. The patient had a history 
of advanced high-grade pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of the left groin with 
pulmonary metastasis. Clinical examination revealed a massive tumor bulking at 
the left groin with necrosis and phleb- and lymphedema. Given the circumstances, 
open surgery was not possible. Thus, it was decided to treat the patient with an 
endovascular procedure. The postprocedural course was uneventful, the patient 
received blood product and was hemodynamically stable. He was discharged at day 
six with ambulatory follow-up. Endovascular therapy using stent grafts to 
exclude a life-threatening bleeding is a valuable alternative treatment option 
in oncologic patients with limited life expectancy, which are unsuitable for 
surgery.

PEGylation of cationic polyplexes is a promising approach to enhance the 
stability and reduce unspecific interaction with biological components. Herein, 
we systematically investigate the impact of PEGylation on physical and 
biological properties of chitosan/siRNA polyplexes. A series of chitosan-PEG 
copolymers (CS-PEG2k, CS-PEG5k and CS-PEG10k) were synthesized with similar PEG 
mass content but with different molecular weight. PEGylation with higher 
molecular weight and less grafting degree resulted in smaller and more compacted 
nanoparticles with relatively higher surface charge. PEGylated polyplexes showed 
distinct mechanism of endocytosis, which was macropinocytosis and 
caveolae-dependent and clathrin-independent. In vitro silencing efficiency in 
HeLa and H1299 cells was significantly improved by PEGylation and CS-PEG5k/siRNA 
achieved the highest knockdown efficiency. Efficient silence of ribonucleotide 
reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) in HeLa cells by CS-PEG5k/siRRM2 significantly 
induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, 
PEGylation significantly inhibited macrophage phagocytosis and unspecific 
interaction with red blood cells (RBCs). Significant extension of in vivo 
circulation was achieved only with high molecular weight PEG modification 
(CS-PEG10k), whereas all CS/siRNA and CS-PEG/siRNA nanoparticles showed similar 
pattern of biodistribution with major accumulation in liver and kidney. These 
results imply that PEGylation with higher molecular weight PEG and less grafting 
rate is a promising strategy to improve chitosan/siRNA nanocomplexes performance 
both in vitro and in vivo.

A significant part of the genetic code likely originated via a chemical 
interaction, which should be experimentally verifiable. One possible 
verification relates bound amino acids (or perhaps their activated congeners) 
and ribonucleotide sequences within cognate RNA binding sites. To introduce this 
interaction, I first summarize how amino acids function as targets for RNA 
binding. Then the experimental method for selecting relevant RNA binding sites
