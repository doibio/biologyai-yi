in 2016, and the female prevalence rate was significantly higher than that of 
males (P < 0.05). When the body mass index (BMI) was < 32 (kg/m(2)), the 
prevalence of NAFLD increased with the increase of BMI index. When BMI was 
18.5-23.9 kg/m2, 24-27.9 kg/m(2) and > 32 kg/m(2), the prevalence of NAFLD was 
significantly higher in females than males (P < 0.05). There was no significant 
difference in prevalence between males and females with BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) and 
28~31.9 kg/m(2) (P > 0.05). BMI gradually decreased (P < 0.05) with the increase 
of age, and the incidence of NAFLD showed a downward trend (P < 0.05). An 
independent risk factors for NAFLD (P < 0.01) were gender (OR = 0.616), age (OR 
= 0.970), waist circumference (OR = 1.065), triglycerides (OR = 1.162), BMI (OR 
= 1.238), and diastolic blood pressure (OR = 1.012). The probability of NAFLD 
combined with three and four kinds of MS was significantly higher than control 
group (P < 0.05). Subjects' mortality rate during the follow-up period was 
1.94%, 2.23% in the NAFLD group, and 1.89% in the control group. Average life 
expectancy was 75.58 years in NAFLD group and 78.68 years in the control group. 
All deaths in NAFLD groups were associated with MS, and 70.83% combined with 
three or more MS. The primary cause of death in NAFLD group was tumors (37.5%), 
followed by cardiovascular disease (16.67%) and three cases died directly from 
MS. Conclusion: The prevalence of NAFLD in the elderly population in Kunshan 
city, Jiangsu province is relatively low, which may be associated with local 
diet and high-intensity workouts. MS disorders represented by obesity and 
diabetes mellitus are closely associated to the onset of NAFLD. Obesity is the 
most important risk factor for the incidence of NAFLD in the local elderly 
population over 60 years old. However, the risk of NAFLD should not be neglected 
in people with normal BMI, especially in aged women, and the weight control 
should be the most important means to prevent and control NAFLD. NAFLD may 
increase mortality rate and reduce life expectancy in the elderly population. 
The main reason to cause death in the elderly with NAFLD is cardiovascular 
disease and malignant tumors. Simultaneously, multiple MS development may 
increase the death rate in elderly with NAFLD.

Publisher: 目的： 
了解老年人群非酒精性脂肪肝（NAFLD）的检出率、危险因素和独立危险因素，以及死亡原因；分析NAFLD患者代谢综合征（MS）与死亡的关系，为老年人群NAFLD的预防和控制提供依据。 
方法： 以2016年江苏省昆山市某镇当地户口60岁以上老年人群7 
619人为研究对象，分析NAFLD患者的发病率、影响因素及死亡原因，以及NAFLD患者合并MS与死亡的关系。根据资料不同采用H检验、方差分析、t检验、χ(2)检验或logistic回归分析进行统计学分析。 
结果： 2016年江苏省昆山市某镇60岁以上老人NAFLD患病率为14.10%（1 074/7 619），女性患病率显著高于男性（P < 
0.05）；当体质量指数（BMI）< 32 kg/m(2)时，NAFLD的患病率随着BMI指数的升高而升高，在BMI为18.5～23.9 
kg/m(2)、24.0～27.9 kg/m(2)、> 32.0 kg/m(2)时，女性患病率显著高于男性（P < 0.05），而在BMI < 18.5 
kg/m(2)及BMI为28～31.9 kg/m(2)时，男性和女性的患病率差异无统计学意义（P > 0.05）；随着年龄的增长，BMI逐渐下降（P < 
0.05），同时NAFLD的发病率也呈现下降趋势（P < 0.05）；性别（OR = 0.616）、年龄（OR = 0.970）、腰围（OR = 
1.065）、甘油三酯（OR = 1.162）、BMI（OR = 1.238）、舒张压（OR = 1.012）为NAFLD的独立危险因素（P < 
0.01）。NAFLD合并3种及4种MS的概率显著高于对照组（P < 
0.05）。随访期间研究对象的病死率为1.94%，NAFLD组为2.23%，对照组为1.89%；NAFLD组死亡人群的平均寿命为75.58岁，对照组78.68岁；所有NAFLD组的死亡者均合并MS，且70.83%合并3种及以上MS；NAFLD组的首要死亡原因为肿瘤（37.5%），其次为心血管意外（16.67%），直接死因为MS者3例。 
结论： 
被调查人群NAFLD患病率较低，可能与当地老人饮食偏素、劳动强度较大有关，以肥胖、糖尿病为代表的MS紊乱与NAFLD的发病密切相关，其中肥胖为当地60岁以上老年人群NAFLD发病的最重要危险因素，控制体质量应作为预防和控制老年人群NAFLD最重要的手段。然而对正常BMI的人群，也不应忽视NAFLD的风险，尤其是老年女性。NAFLD可能增加老年人群死亡率、降低其寿命，其死因主要为恶性肿瘤和心血管意外，同时患多种MS可能增加NAFLD老年人群的死亡。.

OBJECTIVE: Youth depression can be prevented, yet few programs are offered. 
Decision makers lack cost information. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral prevention program (CBP) versus 
usual care.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with data from a randomized 
controlled trial of 316 youths, ages 13-17, randomly assigned to CBP or usual 
care. Youths were at risk of depression because of a prior depressive disorder 
or subthreshold depressive symptoms, or both, and had parents with a prior or 
current depressive disorder. Outcomes included depression-free days (DFDs), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs.
RESULTS: Nine months after baseline assessment, youths in CBP experienced 12 
more DFDs (p=.020) and .018 more QALYs (p=.007), compared with youths in usual 
care, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $24,558 per QALY. 
For youths whose parents were not depressed at baseline, CBP youths had 26 more 
DFDs (p=.001), compared with those in usual care (ICER=$10,498 per QALY). At 33 
months postbaseline, youths in CBP had 40 more DFDs (p=.05) (ICER=$12,787 per 
QALY). At 33 months, CBP youths whose parents were not depressed at baseline had 
91 more DFDs (p=.001) (ICER=$13,620 per QALY). For youths with a currently 
depressed parent at baseline, CBP was not significantly more effective than 
usual care at either 9 or 33 months, and costs were higher.
CONCLUSIONS: CBP produced significantly better outcomes than usual care and was 
particularly cost-effective for youths whose parents were not depressed at 
baseline. Depression prevention programs could improve youths' health at a 
reasonable cost; services to treat depressed parents may also be warranted.

New neurons arise from quiescent adult neural progenitors throughout life in 
specific regions of the mammalian brain. Little is known about the embryonic 
origin and establishment of adult neural progenitors. Here, we show that Hopx+ 
precursors in the mouse dentate neuroepithelium at embryonic day 11.5 give rise 
to proliferative Hopx+ neural progenitors in the primitive dentate region, and 
they, in turn, generate granule neurons, but not other neurons, throughout 
development and then transition into Hopx+ quiescent radial glial-like neural 
progenitors during an early postnatal period. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses of 
Hopx+ embryonic, early postnatal, and adult dentate neural progenitors further 
reveal common molecular and epigenetic signatures and developmental dynamics. 
Together, our findings support a "continuous" model wherein a common neural 
progenitor population exclusively contributes to dentate neurogenesis throughout 
development and adulthood. Adult dentate neurogenesis may therefore represent a 
lifelong extension of development that maintains heightened plasticity in the 
mammalian hippocampus.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The American Cancer Society has recommended initiating 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 years instead of 50 years. We 
estimated the cost effectiveness and national effects of adopting this 
recommendation.
METHODS: We compared screening strategies and alternative resource allocations 
in a validated Markov model. We based national projections on screening 
participation rates by age and census data.
RESULTS: Screening colonoscopy initiation at age 45 years instead of 50 years in 
1000 persons averted 4 CRCs and 2 CRC deaths, gained 14 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), cost $33,900/QALY gained, and required 758 additional 
colonoscopies. These 758 colonoscopies could instead be used to screen 231 
currently unscreened 55-year-old persons or 342 currently unscreened 65-year-old 
persons, through age 75 years. These alternatives averted 13-14 CRC cases and 
6-7 CRC deaths and gained 27-28 discounted QALYs while saving $163,700-$445,800. 
Improving colonoscopy completion rates after abnormal results from a fecal 
immunochemical test yielded greater benefits and savings. Initiation of fecal 
immunochemical testing at age 45 years instead of 50 years cost $7700/QALY 
gained. Shifting current age-specific screening rates to 5 years earlier could 
avert 29,400 CRC cases and 11,100 CRC deaths over the next 5 years but would 
require 10.7 million additional colonoscopies and cost an incremental $10.4 
billion. Improving screening rates to 80% in persons who are 50-75 years old 
would avert nearly 3-fold more CRC deaths at one third the incremental cost.
CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model analysis, we found that starting CRC screening at 
age 45 years is likely to be cost effective. However, greater benefit, at lower 
cost, could be achieved by increasing participation rates for unscreened older 
and higher-risk persons.

The town of Anamizu in Housu District, Ishikawa Prefecture, in the northern part 
of the Noto Peninsula, has 8600 residents of whom 45.4% are 65 years or older, 
making it a region with an aging population. A project was launched to "make 
Anamizu a town known for the good health and long life" of its citizens. The 
project involved, among other things, health classes run by health outreach 
workers. The local government of Anamizu enlisted the participation of local 
pharmacists, by requesting that the Anamizu group of the northern Noto chapter 
of the Ishikawa Prefecture Pharmacists Association (comprising seven pharmacies) 
conduct health classes. The pharmacies within the specified group collaborated 
to hold 17 classes in 17 areas within six months, starting from October 2016. 
They conducted the health classes and held periodic meetings to confirm class 
topics and to standardize the responses to questions from the participants. In 
all, 258 residents joined the health classes, and the Anamizu pharmacist group 
received requests to hold more classes in 2017, based on positive feedback. The 
strong relationship among the pharmacies in the Anamizu group was one factor in 
the success of this project, executed in cooperation with the Department of 
Health Promotion. The shared goals of the pharmacies while tackling various 
projects-for example, in running a booth representing the Anamizu group at 
health festivals-enhanced their collaborative activities. The Anamizu group 
plans to conduct various other community activities in the future to improve the 
QOL of local residents.

We have conducted health promotion workshops in Kobe City, beginning in June 
2016, to promote the view of pharmacies as community health centers that provide 
not only medicine but also offer support for maintaining and enhancing a 
person's health. To this end, we collaborated with Kobe Women's University 
(KWU). Our health promotion workshops included: 1. Activities of daily living 
(ADL) exercises led by a KWU professional; 2. Lectures on various diseases by 
dietitians and pharmacists; 3. Nutritional guidance from a dietitian; 4. Health 
counseling by a pharmacist; and 5. Measurements of bone density, vascular age, 
and so on. A significant portion of the participants were relatively healthy and 
had strong legs. In October 2017, we investigated changes in the participants' 
awareness about health through a questionnaire study. We analyzed the results of 
26 individuals who participated in the workshops more than once-18 of them (69%) 
expressed increased interest in exercise, 15 (58%) had begun walking regularly, 
and 11 (42%) changed their diet in terms of dietary fiber and salt. This 
suggests that our health promotion workshops brought about positive changes in 
people with regard to awareness of health and a healthy lifestyle. To further 
explore how pharmacies might contribute to healthy life expectancy, we will 
continue to investigate the relationship between changes in exercise and diet 
and people's awareness of health. As a group exercise, from now on we have 
decided to expand the role of pharmacies as community health promotion centers 
with the slogan "Extend healthy life expectancy by having fun".

BACKGROUND: Treatment with evolocumab reduces mean low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) up to 75% and cardiovascular events by 16% in the first year 
and 25% thereafter. Methods and Results: Japanese patients with 
hypercholesterolemia enrolled in the parent YUKAWA-1-2 studies could enroll, 
once eligible, in the OSLER studies (n=556). OSLER re-randomized patients 2:1 to 
evolocumab plus standard of care (SOC; evolocumab+SOC) or SOC alone for 1 year; 
after year 1, patients could enter the all-evolocumab+SOC open-label extension 
of OSLER. Patients received evolocumab+SOC from the 2nd year through up to 5 
years. Long-term efficacy and safety, including antidrug antibodies, were 
evaluated. Of 556 patients, 532 continued to the all-evolocumab+SOC extension: 
mean (standard deviation [SD]) age 61 (10) years, 39% female. A total of 91% of 
532 patients completed the studies. Mean (SD) LDL-C change from parent-study 
baseline with evolocumab from a mean (SD) baseline of 142.3 (21.3) and 105.0 
(31.1) mg/dL in OSLER-1 and OSLER-2, respectively, was maintained through the 
end of the study: -58.0% (19.1%) at year 5 in OSLER-1, -62.7% (25.6%) at year 3 
in OSLER-2. The overall safety profile of the evolocumab+SOC periods was similar 
to that of the year-1 controlled period. Antidrug antibodies were detected 
transiently in 3 patients. No neutralizing antibodies were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Japanese patients who continued evolocumab+SOC for up to 5 years 
experienced sustained high LDL-C level reduction. Long-term evolocumab+SOC 
exposure showed no new safety signals.

A 19-year-old male with early refractory hypertension, hypokalemia, serum 
potassium level of 3.4 mmol/l and hypoaldosteronemia was indicated in the 
present study. According to the results of laboratory tests and examinations, 
the patient was suspected of having Liddle's syndrome (LS). Genetic analysis of 
SCNN1B revealed a deletion mutation (c.1721delC). This mutation caused a length 
extension of SCNN1B coding sequence, which resulted in p.Pro574HisfsX675. A 
total of 34 family members were enrolled in the study and 29 of these family 
members underwent genetic testing. A total of 10 family members were clinically 
diagnosed with hypertension. Notably, 5 family members shared the same gene 
mutation as the proband and all cases with the mutation had hypertension. Blood 
pressure of the gene mutation carriers was well controlled by tailored 
treatment. In conclusion, a patient with early onset and refractory 
hypertension, hypokalemia and hypoaldosteronemia was diagnosed clinically and 
genetically with LS. Notably, a novel mutation (c.1721delC) was identified by 
DNA analysis. The present findings indicate that genetic analysis is useful, not 
only in the diagnosis of LS, but also in designing a tailored treatment.

This pilot randomised controlled study evaluated the effects of a 
nutrient-supported intermittent energy restriction nutrition programme to 
prevent weight gain in healthy overweight adults during the 6-week winter 
holiday period between Thanksgiving and New Year. For 52 d, twenty-two 
overweight adults (mean age 41·0 years, BMI 27·3 kg/m2) were assigned to either 
the nutrition programme (n 10; two fasting days of 730 kcal/d (3050 kJ/d) of 
balanced shake and dietary supplements to support weight management efforts, 
followed by 5 d of habitual diet) or a control group (n 12; habitual diet). A 
significant weight loss from baseline (pre-holiday 10 d before Thanksgiving) to 
day 52 (post-holiday 3 January) was observed in the nutrition programme (75·0 
(sd 9·8) v. 76·3 (sd 9·8) kg; P < 0·05). Body weight did not significantly 
change in the control group and there was no between-group difference. Increases 
from baseline in fasting insulin (42·9 %; P = 0·0256), updated homoeostasis 
model assessment (HOMA2) (43 %; P = 0·025), LDL-cholesterol (8·4 %; P = 0·0426) 
and total cholesterol (7·1 %; P = 0·0154) levels were also reported in the 
control group. In the nutrition programme group, baseline HDL-cholesterol and 
TAG levels measured after two fasting days increased (13 %; P = 0·0245) and 
decreased (22·8 %; P = 0·0416), respectively. There was no significant change in 
HOMA2. Between-group differences in changes in insulin levels (P = 0·0227), 
total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (P = 0·0419) and HOMA2 (P = 0·0210) were 
significant. Overall compliance rate was 98 % and no severe adverse events were 
reported. These preliminary findings suggest that this intermittent energy 
restriction intervention might support weight management efforts and help 
promote metabolic health during the winter holiday season.

OBJECTIVE: A huge amount of the efforts made by health teams is dedicated to 
caring for cancer patients. This study has aimed to investigate the effect of 
self-care training on life expectancy and quality of life (QOL) in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer who were under radiotherapy.
METHODS: In this clinical trial, 50 patients were selected using the block 
randomization method. The intervention was performed at Ayatollah Khansari 
Hospital in Arak, Iran. The patients in the intervention group received three 
sessions of face-to-face training. The data collection tools included 
Schneider's Life Expectancy Questionnaire and EORTC QOLQ-C30. Data were analyzed 
by SPSS version 23.
RESULTS: In the control group, 16 were male (64%) and 9 female (36%), and in the 
intervention group, 14 were male (56%) and 11 were female (44%). Before the 
intervention, the two groups were homogenous regarding all variables. After the 
intervention, the mean of QOL was 67 ± 22.62 in the intervention group and 56 ± 
18.55 in the control group (P < 0.05). In examining the different dimensions of 
QOL, improvement in all functional dimensions was observed in the intervention 
group. After the intervention, the mean score of life expectancy showed a 
significant difference (P < 0.05) between the intervention group (39.52 ± 5.26) 
and the control group (31.6 ± 7.13).
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that self-care training improved the QOL and life 
expectancy of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were under radiotherapy. 
Therefore, self-care training is recommended to improve the QOL and the life 
expectancy of cancer patients.

Despite recent scientific advances, most rare genetic diseases - including most 
neuro-muscular diseases - do not currently have curative gene-based therapies 
available. However, in some cases, such as vitamin, cofactor or enzyme 
deficiencies, channelopathies and disorders of the neuromuscular junction, a 
confirmed genetic diagnosis provides guidance on treatment, with drugs available 
that may significantly alter the disease course, improve functional ability and 
extend life expectancy. Nevertheless, many treatable patients remain undiagnosed 
or do not receive treatment even after genetic diagnosis. The growth of 
computer-aided genetic analysis systems that enable clinicians to diagnose their 
undiagnosed patients has not yet been matched by genetics-based decision-support 
systems for treatment guidance. Generating a 'treatabolome' of treatable 
variants and the evidence for the treatment has the potential to increase 
treatment rates for treatable conditions. Here, we use the congenital myasthenic 
syndromes (CMS), a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous but 
frequently treatable neuromuscular conditions, to illustrate the steps in the 
creation of a treatabolome for rare inherited diseases. We perform a systematic 
review of the evidence for pharmacological treatment of each CMS type, gathering 
evidence from 207 studies of over 1000 patients and stratifying by genetic 
defect, as treatment varies depending on the underlying cause. We assess the 
strength and quality of the evidence and create a dataset that provides the 
foundation for a computer-aided system to enable clinicians to gain easier 
access to information about treatable variants and the evidence they need to 
consider.

Background and purpose - The association between long-term patient survival and 
elective primary total hip replacement (THR) has been described extensively. The 
long-term survival following reoperation of THR is less well understood. We 
investigated the relative survival of patients undergoing reoperation following 
elective THR and explored an association between the indication for the 
reoperation and relative survival. Patients and methods - In this observational 
cohort study we selected the patients who received an elective primary THR and 
subsequent reoperations during 1999-2017 as recorded in the Swedish Hip 
Arthroplasty Register. The selected cohort was followed until the end of the 
study period, censoring or death. The indications for 1st- and eventual 2nd-time 
reoperations were analyzed and the relative survival ratio of the observed 
survival and the expected survival was determined. Results - There were 9,926 
1st-time reoperations and of these 2,558 underwent further reoperations. At 5 
years after the latest reoperation, relative survival following 1st-time 
reoperations was 0.94% (95% CI 0.93-0.96) and 0.90% (CI 0.87-0.92) following 
2nd-time reoperations. At 5 years patients with a 1st-time reoperation for 
aseptic loosening had higher survival than expected; however, reoperations 
performed for periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, and infection had lower 
survival. Interpretation - The relative survival following 1st- and 2nd-time 
reoperations in elective THR patients differs by reason for reoperation. The 
impact of reoperation on life expectancy is more obvious for 
infection/dislocation and periprosthetic fracture.

Knee Arthroplasty?

INTRODUCTION: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) to prevent prosthetic joint 
infection remains controversial. The lack of prophylaxis guideline consensus 
from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental 
Association (ADA) contributes to clinician confusion.
OBJECTIVES: This cost-effectiveness decision model informs the AP debate and 
guideline development by comparing the benefits, harms, and costs of alternative 
prophylaxis strategies.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed comparing lifetime health 
outcomes and costs of alternative AP strategies for dental patients aged 65 y 
with a history of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Based on our interpretation of 
AP recommendations from the AAOS and ADA, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were calculated to compare the following strategies: no AP, AP for the first 2 y 
after a TKA, and lifetime AP.
RESULTS: The no-AP strategy had the lowest average lifetime costs ($17,119) and 
quality-adjusted life years (11.2151). Compared with a no-prophylaxis strategy, 
the 2-y AP strategy had incremental costs of $56 and 0.0006 QALYs gained and was 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $95,100) when a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year was 
used. Based on the results of 1-way sensitivity analysis, the no-AP strategy was 
cost-effective when we modestly increased base case amoxicillin adverse event 
estimates that were substantially lower than estimates reported in previous 
models. When plausible combinations of important model parameters were varied, 
model results suggested that there may be clinical scenarios when AP may be 
appropriate for some medically at-risk patient populations.
CONCLUSION: The results of cost-effectiveness decision modeling generally 
support questioning routine AP for dental patients with TKA. Sensitivity 
analyses suggest that prophylaxis may be cost-effective for patient populations 
with a higher medical risk of infection. This finding is consistent with the 
recommendations of the 2015 ADA practice guideline and the appropriate use 
criteria jointly developed by the AAOS and the ADA.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this decision modeling research 
support the contention that routine AP before invasive dental procedures to 
prevent prosthetic joint infection may not be cost-effective for patients 
without medical conditions, potentially conferring a higher infection risk. 
Model sensitivity analyses suggest that there may be clinical situations when 
medically at-risk patients benefit from AP.

BACKGROUND: Unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects muscle 
control and function on one side of the body. Children with unilateral CP 
experience difficulties using their hands together secondary to disturbances 
that occur in the developing fetal or infant brain. Often, the more affected 
limb is disregarded. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) aims to increase 
use of the more affected upper limb and improve bimanual performance. CIMT is 
based on two principles: restraining the use of the less affected limb (for 
example, using a splint, mitt or sling) and intensive therapeutic practice of 
the more affected limb.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) 
in the treatment of the more affected upper limb in children with unilateral CP.
SEARCH METHODS: In March 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 
PEDro, OTseeker, five other databases and three trials registers. We also ran 
citation searches, checked reference lists, contacted experts, handsearched key 
journals and searched using Google Scholar.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs or 
clinically controlled trials implemented with children with unilateral CP, aged 
between 0 and 19 years, where CIMT was compared with a different form of CIMT, 
or a low dose, high-dose or dose-matched alternative form of upper-limb 
intervention such as bimanual intervention. Primarily, outcomes were bimanual 
performance, unimanual capacity and manual ability. Secondary outcomes included 
measures of self-care, body function, participation and quality of life.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles 
and abstracts to eliminate ineligible studies. Five review authors were paired 
to extract data and assess risk of bias in each included study. GRADE 
assessments were undertaken by two review authors.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 36 trials (1264 participants), published between 2004 
and 2018. Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 105 (mean 35). Mean age was 5.96 years 
(standard deviation (SD) 1.82), range three months to 19.8 years; 53% male and 
47% participants had left hemiplegia. Fifty-seven outcome measures were used 
across studies. Average length of CIMT programs was four weeks (range one to 10 
weeks). Frequency of sessions ranged from twice weekly to seven days per week. 
Duration of intervention sessions ranged from 0.5 to eight hours per day. The 
mean total number of hours of CIMT provided was 137 hours (range 20 to 504 
hours). The most common constraint devices were a mitt/glove or a sling (11 
studies each).We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high across the studies.
KEY RESULTS: Primary outcomes at primary endpoint (immediately after 
intervention)CIMT versus low-dose comparison (e.g. occupational therapy)We found 
low-quality evidence that CIMT was more effective than a low-dose comparison for 
improving bimanual performance (mean difference (MD) 5.44 Assisting Hand 
Assessment (AHA) units, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.37 to 8.51).CIMT was more 
effective than a low-dose comparison for improving unimanual capacity (Quality 
of upper extremity skills test (QUEST) - Dissociated movement MD 5.95, 95% CI 
2.02 to 9.87; Grasps; MD 7.57, 95% CI 2.10 to 13.05; Weight bearing MD 5.92, 95% 
CI 2.21 to 9.6; Protective extension MD 12.54, 95% CI 8.60 to 16.47). Three 
studies reported adverse events, including frustration, constraint refusal and 
reversible skin irritations from casting.CIMT versus high-dose comparison (e.g. 
individualised occupational therapy, bimanual therapy)When compared with a 
high-dose comparison, CIMT was not more effective for improving bimanual 
performance (MD -0.39 AHA Units, 95% CI -3.14 to 2.36). There was no evidence 
that CIMT was more effective than a high-dose comparison for improving unimanual 
capacity in a single study using QUEST (Dissociated movement MD 0.49, 95% CI 
-10.71 to 11.69; Grasp MD -0.20, 95% CI -11.84 to 11.44). Two studies reported 
that some children experienced frustration participating in CIMT.CIMT versus 
dose-matched comparison (e.g. Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy, bimanual 
therapy, occupational therapy)There was no evidence of differences in bimanual 
performance between groups receiving CIMT or a dose-matched comparison (MD 0.80 
AHA units, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.38).There was no evidence that CIMT was more 
effective than a dose-matched comparison for improving unimanual capacity (Box 
and Blocks Test MD 1.11, 95% CI -0.06 to 2.28; Melbourne Assessment MD 1.48, 95% 
CI -0.49 to 3.44; QUEST Dissociated movement MD 6.51, 95% CI -0.74 to 13.76; 
Grasp, MD 6.63, 95% CI -2.38 to 15.65; Weightbearing MD -2.31, 95% CI -8.02 to 
3.40) except for the Protective extension domain (MD 6.86, 95% CI 0.14 to 
13.58).There was no evidence of differences in manual ability between groups 
receiving CIMT or a dose-matched comparison (ABILHAND-Kids MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 
to 1.18). From 15 studies, two children did not tolerate CIMT and three 
experienced difficulty.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of evidence for all conclusions was low to 
very low. For children with unilateral CP, there was some evidence that CIMT 
resulted in improved bimanual performance and unimanual capacity when compared 
to a low-dose comparison, but not when compared to a high-dose or dose-matched 
comparison. Based on the evidence available, CIMT appears to be safe for 
children with CP.

In Asia, which has a rapidly aging population, dementia is the most prominent 
disease. This article presents an application of Latent Growth Mixture Model 
(LGMM) to identify classes of individual Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other 
dementias Years Lived with Disability (YLD) rates for Asian and North African 
countries based on the unobserved heterogeneity. The AD and other dementias YLD 
data for both sexes and age-standardized groups reported by the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study database during 1990-2015 for 55 Asian and North African 
countries were analyzed via LGMM. Findings of LGMMs identified four classes of 
YLD trajectories. Among the specified classes, a class was related to a single 
country (Turkey) with the highest starting point in 1990 (intercept of 218.52 
per 100,000) and upward trend. Another class with increasing trend (a slope of 
2.66 per 100,000) consisted of India, China, Singapore, Japan, and Egypt. Other 
countries in Asia and North Africa (Classes 3 and 4) had a downward trend of YLD 
rates. The upward trend for some parts of Asia and North Africa might be 
attributed to appropriate therapeutic strategies, higher levels of awareness, 
related medical cares, and increase in life expectancy in these countries.

Serious mental illness (SMI) is a disabling condition that develops early in 
life and imposes substantial economic burden. There is a growing belief that 
early intervention for SMI has lifelong benefits for patients. However, 
assessing the cost-effectiveness of early intervention efforts is hampered by a 
lack of evidence on the long-term benefits. We addressed this by using a dynamic 
microsimulation model to estimate the lifetime burden of SMI for those diagnosed 
by age twenty-five. We estimated that the per patient lifetime burden of SMI is 
$1.85 million. We also found that a policy intervention focused on improving the 
educational attainment of people with SMI reduces the average per person burden 
of SMI by $73,600 (4.0 percent)-a change driven primarily by higher lifetime 
earnings-or over $8.9 billion in reduced burden per cohort of SMI patients. 
These findings provide a benchmark for the potential value of improving 
educational attainment for people with SMI.

Arbitrary microbiological limits or noticeable organoleptic decline are mainly 
used to define the shelf life of vacuum packaged chilled beef (VPCB). Excellent 
temperature control is critical to enable a long shelf life. The robustness of 
export supply chains was tested by sending Australian VPCB (striploins) to three 
Chinese destinations and a CONTROL (Brisbane, Australia) treatment (~-1 °C). 
Data loggers monitored temperature during storage and meat biochemistry (pH, 
color, weep), aerobic plate counts, lactic acid bacteria, total volatile basic 
nitrogen (TVB-N) and sensory changes were measured 84, 98, 120 and 140 days 
postslaughter. Temperature was generally well maintained and sensory scores were 
not indicative of spoilage. Microbial counts did not increase from 84 to 
140 days, however TVB-N increased with time and was a better predictor of 
sensory attributes. TVB-N was below the limit of 15 mg/100 g in all CONTROL 
samples but most Chinese samples exceeded this value. This study demonstrated

In 2016, the American Society of Clinical Oncology published a guideline 
recommending that all patients with advanced cancer be referred to palliative 
care providers. This recommendation was based on a series of trials showing that 
palliative care, when added to standard oncology treatment, improves outcomes, 
including quality of life. Here, 2 oncologists, 1 of whom is also a palliative 
care specialist, debate the guideline and discuss how best to care for a

Testosterone is an essential hormone required for the developmental growth and 
maintenance of the male phenotype during the whole life. With the increasing 
male life expectancy worldwide and development of adequate testosterone 
preparations, the prescription of testosterone has increased tremendously. 
Testosterone replacement should be based on low serum testosterone and related 
clinical symptoms. In the last two decades, with the accumulation of data, 
official recommendations have evolved in terms of definition, diagnosis, 
treatment, and follow-up. In practice, it is better for physicians to follow the 
Institutional Official Recommendations or Clinical Practice Guideline for an 
adequate diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency. Currently, four
