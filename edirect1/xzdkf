BACKGROUND: The Chinese population has aged significantly in the last few 
decades. Comprehensive health losses including both fatal and non-fatal health 
outcomes associated with ageing in China have not been detailed.
METHODS: Based on freely accessible disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
estimated by the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2017, we adopted a robust 
decomposition method that ascribes changes in DALYs in any given country across 
two time points to changes resulting from three sources: population size, age 
structure, and age-specific DALYs rate per 100,000 population. Using the method, 
we calculated DALYs associated with population ageing in China from 1990 to 2017 
and examined the counteraction between the effects of DALYs rate change and 
population ageing. This method extends previous work through attributing the 
change in DALYs to the three sources.
RESULTS: Population ageing was associated with 92.8 million DALYs between 1990 
and 2017 in China, of which 65.8% (61.1 million) were years of life lost (YLLs). 
Males had comparatively more DALYs associated with population ageing than 
females in the study period. The five leading causes of DALYs associated with 
population ageing between 1990 and 2017 were stroke (23.6 million), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (18.3 million), ischemic heart disease 
(13.0 million), tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (6.1 million) and liver 
cancer (5.0 million). Between 1990 and 2017, changes in DALYs associated with 
age-specific DALY rate reductions far exceeded those related to population 
ageing (- 196.2 million versus 92.8 million); 57.5% (- 112.8 million) of DALYs 
were caused by decreases in rates attributed to 84 modifiable risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Population ageing was associated with growing health loss in China 
from 1990 to 2017. Despite the recent progress in alleviating health loss 
associated with population ageing, the government should encourage scientific 
research on effective and affordable prevention and control strategies and 
should consider investment in resources to implement strategies nationwide to 
address the future challenge of population ageing.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
(HIV) has increased, but its oral manifestations can affect the Oral 
Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) of these patients. This study aimed to 
evaluate OHRQoL in HIV-infected patients and determine its related factors.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 250 HIV-infected patients were randomly 
selected from Shiraz Voluntary Counseling and Testing center in 2019. OHRQoL was 
measured using the revised Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index for HIV 
patients. The associations between patients' OHRQoL and demographic 
characteristics were examined.
RESULTS: The mean score of the patients' OHRQoL was 24.55 ± 6.27. The lowest and 
highest scores belonged to the psychosocial and pain categories, respectively. 
In the univariate analysis, the OHRQoL was significantly associated with 
patients' age (p = 0.012), duration of the disease (p = 0.009), job (p = 0.006), 
edentulous status (p = 0.003), and wearing denture (p < 0.001). However, in the 
multiple linear regression analysis, a significant difference was found only 
between denture wearing and non-denture wearing patients (p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The OHRQoL of HIV-infected patients was not optimal since most of 
the patients were worried about their oral and dental health problems. The 
OHRQoL was significantly better in denture-wearing patients. This finding 
highlights the impact of unmet dental needs on OHRQoL in HIV-infected patients. 
Therefore, dental services coverage for patients with HIV is essential, so that 
they can have timely access to oral health care. Furthermore, dentures should be 
considered as an unmet healthcare need among HIV patients in public health 
policies.

BACKGROUND: Reducing adult mortality by 2030 is a key component of the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Monitoring progress towards 
these goals requires timely and reliable information on deaths by age, sex and 
cause. To estimate baseline measures for UNSDGs, this study aimed to use several 
different data sources to estimate subnational measures of premature adult 
mortality (between 30 and 70 years) for India in 2017.
METHODS: Age-specific population and mortality data were accessed for India and 
its 21 larger states from the Civil Registration System and Sample Registration 
System for 2017, and the most recent National Family and Health Survey. Similar 
data on population and deaths were also procured from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2016 and the National Burden of Disease Estimates Study for 2017. 
Life table methods were used to estimate life expectancy and age-specific 
mortality at national and state level from each source. An additional set of 
life tables were estimated using an international two-parameter model life table 
system. Three indicators of premature adult mortality were derived by sex for 
each location and from each data source, for comparative analysis RESULTS: 
Marked variations in mortality estimates from different sources were noted for 
each state. Assuming the highest mortality level from all sources as the 
potentially true value, premature adult mortality was estimated to cause a 
national total of 2.6 million male and 1.8 million female deaths in 2017, with 
Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal accounting for 
half of these deaths. There was marked heterogeneity in risk of premature adult 
mortality, ranging from 351 per 1000 in Kerala to 558 per 1000 in Chhattisgarh 
among men, and from 198 per 1000 in Himachal Pradesh to 409 per 1000 in Assam 
among women.
CONCLUSIONS: Available data and estimates for mortality measurement in India are 
riddled with uncertainty. While the findings from this analysis may be useful 
for initial subnational health policy to address UNSDGs, more reliable empirical 
data is required for monitoring and evaluation. For this, strengthening death 
registration, improving methods for cause of death ascertainment and 
establishment of robust mortality statistics programs are a priority.

Is it possible to slow the rate of ageing, or do biological constraints limit 
its plasticity? We test the 'invariant rate of ageing' hypothesis, which posits 
that the rate of ageing is relatively fixed within species, with a collection of 
39 human and nonhuman primate datasets across seven genera. We first 
recapitulate, in nonhuman primates, the highly regular relationship between life 
expectancy and lifespan equality seen in humans. We next demonstrate that 
variation in the rate of ageing within genera is orders of magnitude smaller 
than variation in pre-adult and age-independent mortality. Finally, we 
demonstrate that changes in the rate of ageing, but not other mortality 
parameters, produce striking, species-atypical changes in mortality patterns. 
Our results support the invariant rate of ageing hypothesis, implying biological 
constraints on how much the human rate of ageing can be slowed.

Reproductive decision-making and fertility patterns change with time and place, 
and are influenced by contemporary societal factors. In this paper, we have 
studied biosocial aspects of reproductive decision-making over time and 
generations in a Nordic setting. The aim was to explore intergenerational 
changes and influences on decision-making, especially regarding preconditions to 
first birth. Twenty-six focus group interviews were conducted in southern 
Sweden, including a total of 110 participants aged 17-90 years. The analysis of 
the interviews resulted in six themes: (i) 'Providing security - an 
intergenerational precondition'; (ii) 'A growing smorgasbord of choices and 
requirements'; (iii) 'Parenthood becoming a project'; (iv) 'Stretched out life 
stages'; (v) '(Im)possibilities to procreate'; and (vi) 'Intergenerational 
pronatalism'. Our findings reflect increasing expectations on what it means to 
be prepared for parenthood. Despite increasing awareness of the precariousness 
of romantic relationships, people still wish to build new families but try to be 
as prepared as possible for adverse events. The findings also show how 
increasing life expectancy and medical advancements have come to influence 
people's views on their reproductive timeline.

INTRODUCTION: Guidelines for routine antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before dental 
procedures to prevent periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) have been hampered by 
the lack of prospective clinical trials.
OBJECTIVES: To apply value-of-information (VOI) analysis to quantify the value 
of conducting further clinical research to reduce decision uncertainty regarding 
the cost-effectiveness of AP strategies for dental patients undergoing total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: An updated decision model and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of AP and decision uncertainty for 3 AP 
strategies: no AP, 2-y AP, and lifetime AP. VOI analyses estimated the value and 
cost of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or observational study. 
We used a linear regression meta-modeling approach to calculate the population 
expected value of partial perfect information and a Gaussian approximation to 
calculate population expected value of sample information, and we subtracted the 
cost for research to obtain the expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS). We 
determined the optimal trial sample sizes that maximized ENBS.
RESULTS: Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year, the PSA found that a no-AP strategy had the highest expected net 
benefit, with a 60% probability of being cost-effective, and 2-y AP had a 37% 
probability. The optimal sample size for an RCT to determine AP efficacy and 
dental-related PJI risk would require approximately 421 patients per arm with an 
estimated cost of $14.7 million. The optimal sample size for an observational 
study to inform quality-of-life parameters would require 2,211 patients with an 
estimated cost of $1.2 million. The 2 trial designs had an ENBS of approximately 
$25 to $26 million.
CONCLUSION: Given the uncertainties associated with AP guidelines for dental 
patients after TKA, we conclude there is value in conducting further research to 
inform the risk of PJI, effectiveness of AP, and quality-of-life values.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this value-of-information analysis 
demonstrate that there is substantial uncertainty around clinical, health 
status, and economic parameters that may influence the antibiotic prophylaxis 
guidance for dental patients with total knee arthroplasty. The analysis supports 
the contention that conducting additional clinical research to reduce decision 
uncertainty is worth pursuing and will inform the antibiotic prophylaxis debate 
for clinicians and dental patients with prosthetic joints.

An evaluation of contralateral hand involvement in the operation of the Delft 
Self-Grasping Hand, an adjustable passive prosthesis.

The Delft Self-Grasping Hand is an adjustable passive prosthesis operated using 
the concept of tenodesis (where opening and closing of the hand is mechanically 
linked to the flexion and extension of the wrist). As a purely mechanical device 
that does not require harnessing, the Self-Grasping Hand offers a promising 
alternative to current prostheses. However, the contralateral hand is almost 
always required to operate the mechanism to release a grasp and is sometimes 
also used to help form the grasp; hence limiting the time it is available for 
other purposes. In this study we quantified the amount of time the contralateral 
hand was occupied with operating the Self-Grasping Hand, classified as either 
direct or indirect interaction, and investigated how these periods changed with 
practice. We studied 10 anatomically intact participants learning to use the 
Self-Grasping Hand fitted to a prosthesis simulator. The learning process 
involved 10 repeats of a feasible subset of the tasks in the Southampton Hand 
Assessment Procedure (SHAP). Video footage was analysed, and the time that the 
contralateral hand was engaged in grasping or releasing was calculated. 
Functionality scores increased for all participants, plateauing at an Index of 
Functionality of 33.5 after 5 SHAP attempts. Contralateral hand involvement 
reduced significantly from 6.47 (first 3 attempts) to 4.68 seconds (last three 
attempts), but as a proportion of total task time remained relatively steady 
(increasing from 29% to 32%). For 9/10 participants most of this time was 
supporting the initiation of grasps rather than releases. The reliance on direct 
or indirect interactions between the contralateral hand and the prosthesis 
varied between participants but appeared to remain relatively unchanged with 
practice. Future studies should consider evaluating the impact of reliance on 
the contralateral limb in day-to-day life and development of suitable training 
methods.

Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify excess all-cause mortality in Switzerland in 2020, a key 
indicator for assessing direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
METHODS: Using official data on deaths in Switzerland, all-cause mortality in 
2020 was compared with that of previous years using directly standardized 
mortality rates, age- and sex-specific mortality rates, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: The standardized mortality rate was 8.8% higher in 2020 than in 2019, 
returning to the level observed 5-6 years before, around the year 2015. This 
increase was greater for men (10.6%) than for women (7.2%) and was statistically 
significant only for men over 70 years of age, and for women over 75 years of 
age. The decrease in life expectancy in 2020 compared to 2019 was 0.7%, with a 
loss of 9.7 months for men and 5.3 months for women.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an excess mortality in Switzerland in 2020, linked to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, as this excess only concerned the elderly, the 
resulting loss of life expectancy was restricted to a few months, bringing the 
mortality level back to 2015.

BACKGROUND: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the recommended 
treatment in ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). The determination of 
Quality of life (QoL) for various options of coronary revascularization is 
important for establishment of a comprehensive care plan. Studies of QoL in 
interventional cardiology are scarce. Our study has compared utility scores and 
quality adjusted life year (QALY) of 2nd and 3rd generation drug eluting stents 
(DES).
METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted to evaluate QoL and QALY 
using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Patients undergoing PPCI between July-Dec 2019 
were evaluated after completion of one year of procedure.
RESULTS: Total 334 patients were evaluated, study population consisted of a 
greater number of males (87.13%) than females. Mean utility value was more in 
3rd G Biomatrix stents; 0.829 ± 0.11 than 2nd G Xience stents; 0.794 ± 0.11 (p < 
0.05). Visual analogue scale (VAS) value was also high in 3rd G DES (81.84 ± 
8.29) as compared to 2nd G DES (77.81 ± 9.01); p< 0.05. A significant 
association was found between utility scores/VAS and age, DM, HTN, Current 
smoking, family history and CAD diagnosis. There was a gain of 0.035 QALY with 
the use of Biomatrix DES.
CONCLUSION: Health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a leading support in the 
decision making of therapeutic interventions. Our study has found that 
Biodegradable polymer (BP) Biomatrix DES are superior to the Durable polymer 
(DP) Xience DES having better QoL and QALY.

OBJECTIVES: To determine if an automatically calculated electronic health record 
score can estimate intermediate-term life expectancy in men with prostate cancer 
to provide guideline concordant care.
METHODS: We identified all men (n = 36,591) diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
2013-2015 in the VHA. Of the 36,591, 35,364 (96.6%) had an available Care 
Assessment Needs (CAN) score (range: 0-99) automatically calculated in the 30 
days prior to the date of diagnosis. It was designed to estimate short-term 
risks of hospitalization and mortality. We fit unadjusted and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards regression models to determine the association between the 
CAN score and overall survival among men with prostate cancer. We compared CAN 
score performance to two established comorbidity measures: The Charlson 
Comorbidity Index and Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index (PCCI).
RESULTS: Among 35,364 men, the CAN score correlated with overall stage, with 
mean scores of 46.5 ( ± 22.4), 58.0 ( ± 24.4), and 68.1 ( ± 24.3) in localized, 
locally advanced, and metastatic disease, respectively. In both unadjusted and 
adjusted models for prostate cancer risk, the CAN score was independently 
associated with survival (HR = 1.23 95%CI 1.22-1.24 & adjusted HR = 1.17 95%CI 
1.16-1.18 per 5-unit change, respectively). The CAN score (overall C-Index 0.74) 
yielded better discrimination (AUC = 0.76) than PCCI (AUC = 0.65) or Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (AUC = 0.66) for 5-year survival.
CONCLUSION: The CAN score is strongly associated with intermediate-term survival 
following a prostate cancer diagnosis. The CAN score is an example of how 
learning health care systems can implement multi-dimensional tools to provide 
fully automated life expectancy estimates to facilitate patient-centered cancer 
care.

This article analyses the relationship between male height and age at death and 
its evolution over time among conscripts born in fourteen villages in north-east 
rural Spain. A total of 1,488 conscripts born between 1835 and 1939 (and who 
died between 1868 and 2019) have been included in the analysis (based on the 
study of 3 sub-periods: 1835-1869, 1870-1899, and 1900-1939). The height data 
have been obtained from military service conscription records and the 
demographic and socioeconomic information of the deceased was obtained from 
parish archives and censuses. The data have been linked according to nominative 
criteria using family reconstitution methods. For the statistical analysis, we 
have used ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions with 
heteroskedasticity-robust estimation. The results suggest a positive 
relationship between height and lifespan in the long-term. For the birth cohorts 
of 1835-1869, conscripts with a height of 170 cm or more lived on average 7.6 
years longer than conscripts measuring less than 160 cm. This difference in life 
expectancy tended to disappear for the birth cohorts of 1900-1939, benefiting 
especially the short conscripts who had greater possibilities to increase their 
average lifespan. The reasons that might explain these changes could reside in 
the improvements experienced by this group in terms of their living conditions, 
health and nutrition during the twentieth century.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: As life expectancy increases, an increasing older population 
may require surgery with perioperative nutritional management. While little is 
known about the combined effect of age and stress on amino acid metabolism 
during enteral nutrition, we hypothesized that blood amino acid bioavailability 
may be influenced not only by the characteristics of the ingested protein but 
also by intestinal ageing and splanchnic sequestration of amino acids. Plasma 
amino acid kinetics were thus evaluated in aged and adult rats receiving 
continuous enteral nutrition before and after standardized surgical stress.
METHODS: Sixteen 5-month-old and sixteen 21-month-old male rats were used. After 
a gastrostomy, the insertion of a jugular vein catheter and a one-week recovery, 
the animals were enterally fed with commercially available formulas containing 
whole milk proteins or a whey hydrolysate for 24 h before (healthy state) and 
18 h after a standardized laparotomy (surgical stress). Data were analyzed by 
3-factor ANOVA.
RESULTS: In all rats, enteral nutrition was associated with a marked increase in 
plasma alanine, threonine, lysine and proline (+50 to +150 μmol/L; p < 0.001), 
and a decrease in glycine (≈-80 μmol/L; p < 0.01). For most amino acids, their 
availability depended first on the amino acid composition of each protein and 
second on surgical stress. Aging was only associated with higher tyrosine and 
threonine availability (p < 0.001). There was only limited statistical 
interaction between age and surgical stress.
CONCLUSION: In rats, plasma amino acid availability during continuous enteral 
nutrition is determined by the nature of the protein source and the occurrence 
of stress. The effects of aging on plasma amino acid availability seem very 
limited. Commonly used formulas therefore appear to be as suitable for elderly 
patients as for adult patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subset of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) which is characterized by the fusion of promyelocytic leukemia 
PML and retinoic acid receptor- alpha (RAR-alpha) genes. All-trans retinoic acid 
(ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide (ATO) have resulted in durable cytogenetic and 
molecular remissions in most APL patients and have altered the natural history 
of the disease. Most APL patients treated with ATRA and/or ATO are now 
anticipated to have a nearly normal life expectancy. Unfortunately, relapse and 
resistance to the current treatment occur in APL patients and the outcome 
remains dismal in these refractory patients. AXL receptor tyrosine kinase 
(AXL-RTK) has been shown to increase tumour burden, provide resistance to 
therapy and is critical to maintain cancer stem cells (CSCs) in chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) by stabilizing β-catenin in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. 
However, the role of AXL-RTK has not been explored in PML/RARα-positive APL. 
This study aimed to explore the role of AXL-RTK receptor in PML/RARα-positive 
APL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: By using biochemical and pharmacological approaches, here 
we report that targeting of AXL-RTK is related to the down-regulation of 
β-catenin target genes including c-myc (p < 0.001), AXIN2 (p < 0.001), and HIF1α 
(p < 0.01) and induction of apoptosis in PML/RARα-positive APL cell line. 
Resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was also overcomed by targeting 
AXL-RTK with R428 in APL (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results provide clear evidence of the involvement of AXL-RTK in 
leukemogenic potential of PML/RARα-positive APL and suggest targeting of AXL-RTK 
in the treatment of therapy resistant APL patients.

BACKGROUND: The Life Extension Medical Decision law enacted on February 4, 2018 
in South Korea was the first to consider the suspension of futile 
life-sustaining treatment, and its enactment caused a big controversy in Korean 
society. However, no study has evaluated whether the actual implementation of 
life-sustaining treatment has decreased after the enforcement of this law. This 
study aimed to compare the provision of patient consent before and after the 
enforcement of this law among cancer patients who visited a tertiary university 
hospital's emergency room to understand the effects of this law on the clinical 
care of cancer patients.
METHODS: This retrospective single cohort study included advanced cancer 
patients aged over 19 years who visited the emergency room of a tertiary 
university hospital. The two study periods were as follows: from February 2017 
to January 2018 (before) and from May 2018 to April 2019 (after). The primary 
outcome was the length of hospital stay. The consent rates to perform 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation, continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were the secondary 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The length of hospital stay decreased after the law was enforced from 4 
to 2 days (p = 0.001). The rates of direct transfers to secondary hospitals and 
nursing hospitals increased from 8.2 to 21.2% (p = 0.001) and from 1.0 to 9.7%, 
respectively (p < 0.001). The consent rate for admission to the ICU decreased 
from 6.7 to 2.3% (p = 0.032). For CPR and CRRT, the consent rates decreased from 
1.0 to 0.0% and from 13.9 to 8.8%, respectively, but the differences were not 
significant (p = 0.226 and p = 0.109, respectively).
CONCLUSION: After the enforcement of the Life Extension Medical Decision law, 
the length of stay in the tertiary university hospital decreased in patients who 
established their life-sustaining treatment plans in the emergency room. 
Moreover, the rate of consent for ICU admission decreased.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to dysfunction of the 
CFTR protein. CFTR dysfunction leads to disease in the respiratory and 
gastrointestinal systems. Disorders of the cardiovascular system in individuals 
with CF are usually attributed to secondary effects from progressive lung 
disease. However, CFTR has been localized to vascular endothelium and smooth 
muscle, suggesting that CFTR dysfunction may directly impact cardiovascular 
function. As treatments for CF improve and life-expectancy increases, the risk 
of vascular disease may increase in prevalence related to primary and secondary 
CFTR dysfunction, chronic systemic inflammation, nutritional health and 
hyperglycemia in individuals with CF related diabetes. Here we review the 
available literature on CF and the cardiovascular system, examining the 
secondary effects and evidence for direct CFTR dysfunction in the heart, aorta, 
pulmonary vessels, and vasculature, as well as future directions and treatment 
options.

Congenital abnormalities in girls and women with Turner syndrome (TS), alongside 
an underlying predisposition to obesity and hypertension, contribute to an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and ultimately reduced life expectancy. 
We observe that children with TS present a greater variance in aortic arch 
morphology than their healthy counterparts, and hypothesize that their 
hemodynamics is also different. In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) 
simulations were performed for four TS girls, and three age-matched healthy 
girls, using patient-specific inlet boundary conditions, obtained from 
phase-contrast MRI data. The visualization of multidirectional blood flow 
revealed an increase in vortical flow in the arch, supra-aortic vessels, and 
descending aorta, and a correlation between the presence of aortic abnormalities 
and disturbed flow. Compared to the relatively homogeneous pattern of 
time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) on the healthy aortae, a highly 
heterogeneous distribution with elevated TAWSS values was observed in the TS 
geometries. Visualization of further shear stress parameters, such as 
oscillatory shear index (OSI), normalized relative residence time (RRTn), and 
transverse WSS (transWSS), revealed dissimilar heterogeneity in the oscillatory 
and multidirectional nature of the aortic flow. Taking into account the young 
age of our TS cohort (average age 13 ± 2 years) and their obesity level (75% 
were obese or overweight), which is believed to accelerate the initiation and 
progression of endothelial dysfunction, these findings may be an indication of 
atherosclerotic disease manifesting earlier in life in TS patients. Age, obesity 
and aortic morphology may, therefore, play a key role in assessing 
cardiovascular risk in TS children.

We tested associations between social capital or vulnerability and health 
outcome measures of adult obesity, adult diabetes, and life expectancy at the 
county level in the United States with data from 2015 to 2018. This ecological 
cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from four open access databases: 
The Geography of Social Capital (U.S. Congress, 2018), County Health Rankings 
(2018), CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, 2018) and the 
Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF, 2015). Our dependent variables were adult 
obesity, adult diabetes, and life expectancy. We identified the highest and 
lowest states' prevalence for each of three health outcomes in each of the four 
U.S. regions-Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. Each dependent variable was 
assessed using a sample of 32 counties (N = 32). Data analysis consisted of 
bivariate and regression analysis. Our results showed that the most consistent 
measure of "vulnerability" linked significantly to all three health conditions 
studied was percent births to unmarried women (Obesity p < .001; Diabetes 
p = .049; Life Expectancy p = .019). The most consistent measure of "social 
capital" linked to all three health conditions was recreation establishments per 
1,000 inhabitants (Obesity p = .006; Diabetes p = .005; Life Expectancy 
p = .018). We concluded that measures of vulnerability were strongly associated 
with obesity, diabetes, and life expectancy when compared with social capital 
indicators. However, measures of social capital consistently accounted for the 
second-greatest proportion of the variance. Social and community contexts should 
be constantly addressed by both public health governmental- and 
scholarly-research agendas in the United States.

Immunological mechanisms underlying progression of chronic wounds in recessive 
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.

College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Hereditary epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a mechanobullous skin fragility 
disorder characterized by defective epithelial adhesion, leading to mechanical 
stress-induced skin blistering. Based on the level of tissue separation within 
the dermal-epidermal junction, EB is categorized into simplex (EBS), junctional 
(JEB), dystrophic (DEB) and Kindler syndrome. There is no cure for EB, and 
painful chronic cutaneous wounds are one of the major complications in recessive 
(RDEB) patients. Although RDEB is considered a cutaneous disease, recent data 
support the underlying systemic immunological defects. Furthermore, chronic 
wounds are often colonized with pathogenic microbiota, leading to excessive 
inflammation and altered wound healing. Consequently, patients with RDEB suffer 
from a painful sensation of chronic, cutaneous itching/burning and an endless 
battle with bacterial infections. To improve their quality of life and life 
expectancy, it is important to prevent cutaneous infections, dampen chronic 
inflammation and stimulate wound healing. A clear scientific understanding of 
the immunological events underlying the maintenance of chronic poorly healing 
wounds in RDEB patients is necessary to improve disease management and better 
understand other wound healing disorders. In this review, we summarize current 
knowledge of the role of professional phagocytes, such as neutrophils, 
macrophages and dendritic cells, the role of T-cell-mediated immunity in 
lymphoid organs, and the association of microbiota with poor wound healing in 
RDEB. We conclude that RDEB patients have an underlying immunity defect that 
seems to affect antibacterial immunity.
