and 0.88 quality-adjusted life years for LCBDE. Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography remained the optimal strategy for CDL in multiway 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. If LCBDE were performed and the cost of a 
potential operative case lost was $3100 or less and the cost of ERCP 
hospitalization was $18 000 or more, then LCBDE became the preferred treatment 
for CDL.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was both less costly 
and more effective than LCBDE. Factors important to choosing the best strategy 
for CDL management included the cost of a potential case lost due to LCBDE 
performance and the cost of ERCP hospitalization.

Avenida Tres Cruces No. 2, 46014 Valencia, Spain. jose.l.alfonso@uv.es

OBJECTIVE: To discover the total costs and quality of life of burn patients in a 
specialist center classified by diagnosis-related groups (DRGs).
DESIGN: Prospective study of 5-year follow-up from January 1, 1997, through 
December 31, 2001.
SETTING: Burn Center of Valencia.
PATIENTS: A total of 898 patients treated at the Burn Center of Valencia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital, extrahospital, caregiving, labor, and social 
costs of the burn patients grouped by DRG (code 457: extensive burns without 
operating room procedure; code 458: nonextensive burns with skin graft; code 
459: nonextensive burns with wound debridement or other operating room 
procedure; code 460: nonextensive burns without operating room procedure; or 
code 472: extensive burns with operating room procedure) were studied. The costs 
were compared with those that the DRG system assigns. The quality of life of the 
patients at the end of the follow-up period was also studied. To measure quality 
of life, the EuroQol 5-Dimensions survey was used. Utility calculations and 
cost-utility analysis were undertaken according to life expectancy.
RESULTS: The number of quality-adjusted life-years produced by the center was 13 
577, with a mean quality-of-life level on release from the study of 0.87. The 
mean cost per patient, including the social and labor costs, was $95 551, with 
health care costs amounting to only 10%. The mean cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year was $686.
CONCLUSIONS: The labor costs were the most important and amounted to 56%; 
together with the social costs, these constituted 85% of the total costs. The 
DRG code 456 was an option dominated by the remaining DRG codes 458 through 460 
and 472. Given the high costs of treating burn patients, a clear health care 
policy is urgently needed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various melanoma screening 
strategies proposed in the United States.
DESIGN: We developed a computer simulation Markov model to evaluate alternative 
melanoma screening strategies.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of the general population and siblings of 
patients with melanoma. Intervention We considered the following 4 strategies: 
background screening only, and screening 1 time, every 2 years, and annually, 
all beginning at age 50 years. Prevalence, incidence, and mortality data were 
taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Sibling 
risk, recurrence rates, and treatment costs were taken from the literature.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life 
expectancy, and lifetime costs. Cost-effectiveness ratios were in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year (US dollars/QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the general population, screening 1 time, every 2 years, and 
annually saved 1.6, 4.4, and 5.2 QALYs per 1000 persons screened, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 10,100/QALY, US dollars 
80,700/QALY, and US dollars 586,800/QALY, respectively. In siblings of patients 
with melanoma (relative risk, 2.24 compared with the general population), 
1-time, every-2-years, and annual screenings saved 3.6, 9.8, and 11.4 QALYs per 
1000 persons screened, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollars 
4000/QALY, US dollars 35,500/QALY, and US dollars 257,800/QALY, respectively. In 
higher risk siblings of patients with melanoma (relative risk, 5.56), screening 
was more cost-effective. Results were most sensitive to screening cost, melanoma 
progression rate, and specificity of visual screening.
CONCLUSIONS: One-time melanoma screening of the general population older than 50 
years is very cost-effective compared with other cancer screening programs in 
the United States. Screening every 2 years in siblings of patients with melanoma 
is also cost-effective.

We present the statistics for mortality in Navarre for the 1995-2004 period by 
sex, age and cause of death.
METHODS: The data proceeds from the statistical bulletins on death. The 
1995-1999 period is compared with the 2000-2004 period, using adjusted rates to 
the population of Navarre for the year 2001 and the rate of potential years of 
life lost between 0-70 years adjusted to the European population.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in the 2000-2004 period was 77.9 years in men 
and 85 years in women, the latter being one of the highest registered at the 
world level. Infant mortality fell to 3.3 per 1,000 living newborn infants. The 
risk of death has fallen in practically all age groups, with a notable fall in 
mortality of 40% in the 25-34 group at the cost of AIDS. There has been a 
significant increase of mortality due to lung cancer amongst women under 65 
years of age (46%) in the 2000-2004 period with respect to the previous five 
year period and a sharp fall in mortality due to breast cancer (45.4%). In both 
sexes there has been a continued fall of mortality due to cerebrovascular 
diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, cardiac failure and arteriosclerosis and of 
mortality due to ulcer and cirrhosis. The rates of mortality in Navarre in all 
the main groups of causes are lower than those of Europe, except for the rate of 
mortality due to external causes.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of mortality due to lung cancer and other cancers 
related to smoking, due to the spread of consumption in recent decades, could 
have a negative influence on the life expectancy of women in Navarre in coming 
years. The prevention of mortality due to external causes and the prevention of 
deaths linked to tobacco consumption are the two priorities that emerge from the 
data on mortality in this autonomous community.

Motivating disability pensioners with back pain to return to work--a randomized 
controlled trial.

Science, Bergen University College, Norway. liv.magnussen@hib.no

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome of a brief vocational-oriented 
intervention aiming to motivate disability pensioners with back pain to return 
to work, and to evaluate prognostic factors for having entered a return to work 
process during the following year.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted.
SUBJECTS: Participants (n = 89) (mean age 49 years, 65% women) who had received 
disability pension for more than one year were randomized into an intervention 
group (education, reassurance, motivation, vocational counselling, n = 45) and a 
control group (n = 44).
METHODS: Primary outcome measures were return to work or having entered a return 
to work process. Secondary outcome measures were life satisfaction, disability, 
fear avoidance behaviour and expectancy.
RESULTS: The intervention had no statistically significant effect on return to 
work or having entered a return to work process at 1-year follow-up. Twice as 
many in the intervention group (n = 10, 22%) had entered a return to work 
process compared with the controls (n = 5, 11%). The number needed to treat was 
9.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.4, Inf). Only minor differences in 
secondary outcome measures were demonstrated. Positive expectancy, better 
physical performance and less pain were related to return to work.
CONCLUSION: The effort of returning disability pensioners to work by a brief 
vocational-oriented intervention may be of clinical relevance. The effect needs 
to be explored further in larger samples of disability pensioners.

CONICET (National Council for Scientific and Technological Research), Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. stellavazquez@gmail.com

This study is based on a sample of 332 Argentinean teenagers in their last year 
of secondary school. In the context of the relational theory of motivation, an 
attempt is made to determine the motivational categories best predicting Future 
Time Perspective (FTP) extension. The influence of the sex, locus of control, 
social class, and school ethos variables on FTP extension is also explored. A 
scale measuring locus of control and the Motivational Induction Method (MIM) 
have been employed to obtain the data. Through stepwise multiple regression, a 
predictive set is determined, made up of life-meaning values, self-fulfillment, 
academic achievement motivation, locus of control, sensual values, and social 
contact. Significant differences are found in FTP extension and locus of control 
in relation to school ethos. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests are used 
as statistical proof. A one-way ANOVA is run to examine the relationship between 
locus of control and school ethos levels. The possibility of a motivational 
profile common to Argentinean teenagers is considered and the pedagogical 
consequences of the findings are discussed.

Preventive Medicine University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 
14642, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether and how much time in a state of ill oral health 
an older person would be willing to trade for optimal oral health.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study of 76 subjects (52 
female, 24 male) ages 47-93 (mean 75.2) recruited from a Medicare demonstration. 
Subjects had to need or receive help with 2+ activities of daily living (ADLs) 
or 3+ instrumental ADLs plus had to have had recent significant healthcare 
services use. A Time Trade-Off (TTO) approach was used. TTO utility is defined 
as the amount of symptom-free time (i.e., the optimal oral health state) divided 
by the amount of time with symptoms (either their current oral health state or 
the worst imaginable oral health state, depending on the scenario), at the point 
of indifference (the point past which the person is unwilling to trade 
additional life expectancy).
RESULTS: When starting from their current oral health state, 39% of the subjects 
were willing to exchange time resulting in a shorter life with optimal oral 
health. They were willing to trade 14.0 months of life on average and valued 
each year in their current oral health state as 91% of a year in optimal oral 
health. When starting in the poorest oral health state, 79% of the subjects were 
willing to accept a shorter life. They were willing to trade 33.7 months of life 
on average, and valued the poorest state as worth 79% of a year in optimal oral 
health.
CONCLUSIONS: Dentists should take into consideration this group's preference for 
optimal oral health.

[Helicobacter pylori does not contribute to iron deficiency in hemodialysis 
patients].

Tauli/UAB, Parc Tauli s/n, 08208 Sabadell, Barcelona. tlopeza@cspt.es

BACKGROUND: Many studies in the general population have shown a link between 
Helicobacter pylori infection and iron-deficiency, often resulting in 
iron-deficient anaemia. Despite the high prevalence of iron deficiency in 
hemodialysis patients, no studies have been performed in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the 
appearance of anemia and the iron requirements in our hemodialysis population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After excluding patients with severe pathology and short 
life expectancy and those with blood losses secondary to other causes, 79 
patients were included.Iron requirements and anaemia were determined by iron 
serum, ferritin, and hematocrit values; and by transfusion, eritropoietin and 
iron requirements. The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori status was established 
by the concordance of at least two of the three non invasive diagnostic methods 
performed (breath test, serology and fecal antigen of Helicobacter pylori).
RESULTS: Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection was 43%. No significant 
differences between patients infected or not by Helicobacter pylori were found 
in any of the variables analysed: hematocrit (33.5% versus 34.1%), serum iron 
(58.9 versus 63.7 pg/dl), ferritin(340.3 versus 264.2 ng/ml), transferrin 
saturation index (22.5% versus 25.2%), dose of eritropoietin administered (96.6 
versus 93.5 U/kg/weekly), and parenteral iron (1,389 versus 1,538 mg/year). A 
noteworthy finding was that patients with Helicobacter pylori infection had been 
on hemodialysis for a shorter period than those without (37.4 versus 63.7 
months,p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori infection has no effect on anaemia (hematocrit, 
Eritropoietin dose or iron needs) in our hemodialysis patients. Prevalence of 
Helicobacter pylori is lower in patients with longer time on dialysis. We 
consider that the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection must be reserved 
for clinical peptic ulcer suspicion or patients on transplant waiting list.

Traffic injuries are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of children 
around the world. Economic development and quality of life are main components 
of public health. Using canonical correlation analysis, this study examined the 
relationship between quality of life and traffic fatality among children. Data 
were collected from 19 countries by using World Health Organization and OECD 
statistics. The results indicated that there is a strong relationship between 
quality of life and children traffic fatality. Growing quality of life has 
become protective against child traffic accident mortality. Increasing in gross 
national income per capita, life expectancy at birth number of years, road motor 
vehicles per thousand population, and share of persons of working age (15-64 
years) in employment also increases children traffic safety.

The use of bisphosphonates in elderly cancer patients.

Gridelli C(1).

Avellino, Italy. cgridelli@libero.it

As life expectancy increases throughout the 21st century, the size of the 
elderly population will also expand. This will have a marked effect on the 
number of patients with cancer who are classified as elderly. Despite this, the 
design of most clinical studies of cancer therapies excludes those patients who 
are > or =70 years of age. Bisphosphonates are an example of a cancer therapy 
that has not been examined in randomized clinical trials of elderly patients. 
These agents are used for the prevention of skeletal complications and the 
relief of bone pain in patients with bone metastases. When deciding which 
bisphosphonate to prescribe to an elderly patient, each drug should be 
considered on its individual merits. Examples of areas of concern with 
bisphosphonates in elderly patients include their relative renal safety profiles 
and propensity for osteonecrosis of the jaw. Another consideration when choosing 
the most appropriate formulation is the preferred method of administration (oral 
or i.v.), which may affect patient compliance with therapy. As the use of 
bisphosphonates increases, the need for data on their use in elderly patients 
also becomes greater. Clinical trials of bisphosphonates in this patient 
population are currently under way, and their results are keenly awaited.

Life expectancy benefits of gastric bypass surgery.

Pope GD(1), Finlayson SR, Kemp JA, Birkmeyer JD.

Author information:

Hampshire 03756, USA.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for achieving sustained weight 
loss in morbidly obese patients. Although the use of gastric bypass is growing 
rapidly, the potential life expectancy benefits of the procedure are unknown. We 
created a Markov decision analysis model to examine the effect of gastric bypass 
surgery on life expectancy in morbidly obese patients (body mass index [BMI] = 
40 kg/m2). Input assumptions for the model were obtained from published life 
tables (baseline mortality risks), epidemiologic studies (obesity-related excess 
mortality), and large case series (surgical outcomes). In our baseline analysis, 
a 40-year-old woman (BMI = 40 kg/m2) would gain 2.6 years of life expectancy by 
undergoing gastric bypass (38.7 years versus 36.2 years without surgery). In 
sensitivity analysis, life-years gained with surgery remained substantial when 
assumptions were varied across reasonable ranges for surgical mortality risk 
(1.0-3.0 years) and effectiveness (0.9-4.4 years). Life-years gained with 
gastric bypass surgery did not vary considerably by age and sex subgroups. 
Relative to other major surgical procedures, gastric bypass for morbid obesity 
is associated with substantial gains in life expectancy. Long- term data from 
prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2007 Jan 16;146(2):I39.

BACKGROUND: The expected survival of HIV-infected patients is of major public 
health interest.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate survival time and age-specific mortality rates of an 
HIV-infected population compared with that of the general population.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
SETTING: All HIV-infected persons receiving care in Denmark from 1995 to 2005.
PATIENTS: Each member of the nationwide Danish HIV Cohort Study was matched with 
as many as 99 persons from the general population according to sex, date of 
birth, and municipality of residence.
MEASUREMENTS: The authors computed Kaplan-Meier life tables with age as the time 
scale to estimate survival from age 25 years. Patients with HIV infection and 
corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of 
the patient's HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.
RESULTS: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379,872 persons from the general 
population were included in the study, yielding 22,744 (median, 5.8 y/person) 
and 2,689,287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three 
percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median 
survival was 19.9 years (95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection 
and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected 
patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 
2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C 
coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this 
same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection 
compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, 
whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age.
LIMITATIONS: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the 
current maximum observation time of 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young 
person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral 
therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce 
mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population.

Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with 
leuprorelin: a European perspective.

High-risk prostate cancer can be defined as a cancer that, although clinically 
localized, will not be cured by monotherapy, whether surgery or radiation, and 
as a result will require some form of multimodal therapy, which will normally 
include luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists. High-risk localized 
prostate cancer can be identified at three specific points during the management 
of the patient; before starting treatment (based on the profile of some 
predictive criteria, e.g. pathological features, prostate-specific antigen, PSA, 
level, and PSA velocity), on pathological evaluation of a surgical specimen 
taken during radical prostatectomy, or at the point of PSA relapse after 
radiotherapy or surgical therapy. Within Europe, therapeutic choice in patients 
identified as high-risk is normally made based on their age and life-expectancy. 
In those with a relatively long life-expectancy (>10 years) androgen suppression 
therapy (AST) should form part of a multimodal approach to treatment, but 
neoadjuvant hormonal therapy should be limited to use in combined hormonal 
therapy/radiotherapy protocols. AST can also be used to treat patients with PSA 
relapse. Several studies investigated the relative advantages of giving AST 
continuously vs intermittent therapy, but there are no notable differences 
between these approaches. AST monotherapy can be indicated in those patients 
with a shorter life-expectancy (<10 years), particularly if there are poor risk 
factors, e.g. a high PSA level (>50 ng/mL) or a short PSA doubling time (<12 
months).

Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with 
leuprorelin: a Japanese perspective--the effect of primary androgen deprivation 
therapy on stage C prostate cancer.

Stage C prostate cancer, where the tumour has extended beyond the capsule of the 
prostate, is typically a high-risk disease. According to the National Cancer 
Institute Physician Data Query the treatments of choice for stage C disease 
comprise external beam radiation therapy (with or without the addition of 
adjuvant hormone therapy), androgen deprivation by either surgery or hormone 
therapy, radical prostatectomy, or careful observation. From 2001, the Japanese 
Urological Association initiated computer-based registration of all patients 
with prostate cancer in Japan. Data show that overall, 57% of all patients and 
46% of those with T1c to T3 disease had primary androgen deprivation therapy 
(PADT). Similarly, the Japanese Prostate Cancer Group undertook a large-scale 
epidemiological surveillance study in Japan and found that the most commonly 
used hormone therapy is PADT, regardless of disease stage. To date, two 
randomized, controlled trials of the effect of PADT on stage C prostate cancer 
in elderly (> or =75 years old) patients have been undertaken in Japan. The 
results showed that patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with 
PADT are likely to have a life-expectancy similar to that of the normal 
population. In one study, combined androgen blockade (CAB) with leuprorelin plus 
chlormadinone appeared to prolong time to disease progression when compared with 
leuprorelin monotherapy, but there was no difference in survival between these 
treatment groups. In a second study CAB with an luteinizing hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist plus bicalutamide was found to prolong time to 
progression when compared with LHRH agonist monotherapy, but survival results 
for these regimens are still awaited.

AIM: To investigate the incidence of death in patients diagnosed with Crohn's 
disease in Cardiff over 20 years ago.
METHODS: The Cardiff database of patients with Crohn's disease contains data on 
all patients diagnosed there since 1934. Patients (394) diagnosed before 1 
January 1985 were traced and their mortality status on 31 December 2004 was 
established.
RESULTS: The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 1.29 (95% CI 
1.12-1.45) and it has not significantly changed since the 1970s. SMR decreases 
with age, from 16.95 (95% CI 14.99-18.91) for patients aged 10-19 years 
(although only one death) to 0.92 (95% CI 0.65-1.19) in those over 75 years. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis of age at death shows that patients diagnosed aged 10-26 
years have median age at death of 58 years, those aged 27-52 years of 66 years, 
those aged 53-58 years of 74 years, and those over 59 years of 79 years.
CONCLUSIONS: It shows a significantly raised SMR, not statistically changed 
since the 1970s and similar to other chronic conditions. Patients diagnosed 
younger have worse prognosis than those diagnosed later in life and a reduced 
life expectancy compared with the general population.

University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jvandijk@xs4all.nl

BACKGROUND: There is resistance among railway companies and their occupational 
health services to rehabilitating locomotive engineers with ischaemic heart 
disease to their former driving work.
AIM: To study the outcome of vocational rehabilitation for locomotive engineers 
with ischaemic heart disease.
METHODS: In seven European countries, selected locomotive engineers with 
ischaemic heart disease were compared to a matched group of healthy engineers. 
At the end of each calendar year between 1990 and 1999, questionnaires were 
completed by local occupational health physicians to provide information on 
accidents, incidents (professional mistakes), sick leave, (recurrent) cardiac 
events, death and early retirement. We used the life table method with five 
follow-up years to calculate the risk of accidents, incidents and recurrent 
cardiac events.
RESULTS: The accident rate for the cardiac group was 3.8 accidents per 100 
person-years, as compared to a rate of 6.0 in the reference group. The rates for 
incidents were 0.9 and 2.0, respectively. Neither of these differences were 
statistically significant. The duration of sick leave was significantly longer 
among the cardiac group than it was among the reference group, but only in the 
first follow-up year. Thirteen recurrent cardiac events occurred in the cardiac 
group, as compared to a single cardiac event in the reference group. There was 
no difference in the proportion of retirement cases. One engineer in each of the 
two groups died of cardiac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Locomotive engineers can safely resume driving duties following 
onset of cardiac disease.

AIM: The purpose of the present study was to 1) development the scale of the 
self-efficacy of physical activity in frail elderly people (SEPAF), 2) 
investigate the relationship of physical functions and instrumental activity of 
daily living (IADL).
METHODS: The study included 187 community-dwelling elderly people. Subject's 
SEPAF (walking, stair-climbing, lifting a weight), physical functions (usual 
gait speed, maximum gait speed, knee extension muscle strength, hand grip) and 
IADL according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of 
Competence (TMIG Index of Competence) were measured. The reliability of this 
scale was examined using Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest correlation. The 
criterion-related validity and the construct validity were evaluated relatively 
using physical functions and factor analysis. The score was compared between 
young-old and old-old and gender. The correlation between SEPAF and TMIG Index 
of Competence was examined.
RESULTS: Cronbach's a showing internal consistency for these scales were 
0.78-0.82. The score showed significant differences in gender and age group. 
There were significant relationships between SEPAF and physical functions, and 
the TMIG Index of Competence.
CONCLUSION: The SEPAF was shown to be highly reliable. Few scale for frail 
elderly people exist, and it is useful to assess the self-efficacy of physical 
activities in frail and community-dwelling elderly people.

Regulation of intrinsic neuronal properties for axon growth and regeneration.

Regulation of neuritic growth is crucial for neural development, adaptation and 
repair. The intrinsic growth potential of nerve cells is determined by the 
activity of specific molecular sets, which sense environmental signals and 
sustain structural extension of neurites. The expression and function of these 
molecules are dynamically regulated by multiple mechanisms, which adjust the 
actual growth properties of each neuron population at different ontogenetic 
stages or in specific conditions. The neuronal potential for axon elongation and 
regeneration are restricted at the end of development by the concurrent action 
of several factors associated with the final maturation of neurons and of the 
surrounding tissue. In the adult, neuronal growth properties can be 
significantly modulated by injury, but they are also continuously tuned in 
everyday life to sustain physiological plasticity. Strict regulation of 
structural remodelling and neuritic elongation is thought to be required to 
maintain specific patterns of connectivity in the highly complex mammalian CNS. 
Accordingly, procedures that neutralize such mechanisms effectively boost axon 
growth in both intact and injured nervous system. Even in these conditions, 
however, aberrant connections are only formed in the presence of unusual 
external stimuli or experience. Therefore, growth regulatory mechanisms play an 
essentially permissive role by setting the responsiveness of neural circuits to 
environmental stimuli. The latter exert an instructive action and determine the 
actual shape of newly formed connections. In the light of this notion, efficient 
therapeutic interventions in the injured CNS should combine targeted 
manipulations of growth control mechanisms with task-specific training and 
rehabilitation paradigms.

GOALS OF WORK: C-reactive protein (CRP) has been investigated as a predictor of 
life expectancy in terminal cancer in one previous study. However, the other 
variables such as patient's symptom or physical examination findings were not 
considered. The aim of this study is to prove serum CRP level as a predictor of 
survival time, considering patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, 
and various serological variables in terminally ill cancer patients with a 
prospective cohort design.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four terminally ill cancer patients were divided 
into two groups by serum CRP levels and followed up until death. We adjusted the 
influence of some clinical and laboratory variables on survival by use of Cox's 
proportional hazard model. Using the stepwise variable selection method, we 
found the final model. For 19 patients, CRP levels at 2 weeks and a week before 
death were compared by Wilcoxon signed ranks test.
MAIN RESULTS: All 44 study subjects died during the study period, and the median 
survival time was 17 days. Survival time of the elevated CRP group (> or =2.2 
mg/dl) was found to be significantly shorter than the lower CRP group in 
univariate analysis (hazard rate = 3.221, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, 
elevated CRP level (> or =2.2 mg/dl) was selected as one of the unfavorable 
indicators regarding survival. Dyspnea and hyperbilirubinemia were also found 
significant predictors of shorter life expectancy in the final model. Serum CRP 
levels were significantly increased between the first and the second week before 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that serum CRP level can be a useful indicator 
predictive of survival time of terminally ill cancer patients.

Management of early breast cancer in the elderly.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women with an age related 
increase in incidence ranging from 1 in 50 at age 50 to 1 in 10 at age 80. This 
is particularly significant in view of the changing demographics in the western 
population, characterised by an aging population and increased life expectancy. 
However in spite of favourable prognostic factors and less aggressive biological 
behaviour, elderly breast cancer patients receive less aggressive treatment when 
compared with their younger counterparts. Appropriate treatment should be 
offered depending on physiological reserve and comorbidities. Primary endocrine 
treatment has been shown to be associated with significant morbidity in terms of 
disease progression. Prompt surgery and adjuvant treatment can decrease relapse 
and improve survival. Radiation therapy is shown to decrease local relapse and 
chemotherapy may have a role in a select group of patients with adverse 
prognostic factors. With incidence of breast cancer bound to increase in the 
elderly population, it is essential to establish optimum therapy in this cohort 
of patients as studies reveal good outcome from standard treatment.

Sex mortality differences in the United States: the role of cohort smoking 
patterns.

Preston SH(1), Wang H.

Author information:

Philadelphia 19104, USA. spreston@sas.upenn.edu

This article demonstrates that over the period 1948-2003, sex differences in 
mortality in the age range 50-84 widened and then narrowed on a cohort basis 
rather than on a period basis. The cohort with the maximum excess of male 
mortality was born shortly after the turn of the century. Three separate data 
sources suggest that the turnaround in sex mortality differences is consistent 
with sex differences in cigarette smoking by cohort. An age-period-cohort model 
reveals a highly significant effect of smoking histories on men's and women's 
mortality. Combined with recent changes in smoking patterns, the model suggests 
that sex differences in mortality will narrow dramatically in coming decades.

Antonio 78229-3440, USA. smithd2@uthscsa.edu

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reports life expectancy at 
birth (LE) for each year in the United States. Censal year estimates of LE use 
complete life tables. From 1900 through 1947, LEs for intercensal years were 
interpolated from decennial life tables and annual crude death rates. Since 
1948, estimates have been computed from annual life tables. A substantial drop 
in variation in LE occurred in the 1940s. To evaluate these methods and examine 
variation without artifacts of different methods, we estimated a consistent 
series of both annual abridged life tables and LEs from official NCHS 
age-specific death rates and also LEs using the interpolation method for 
1900-1998. Interpolated LEs are several times as variable as life table 
estimates, about 2 times as variable before 1940 and about 6.5 times as variable 
after 1950. Estimates of LE from annual life tables are better measures than 
those based on the mixed methods detailed in NCHS reports. Estimates from life 
tables show that the impact of the 1918 influenza pandemic on LE was much 
smaller than indicated by official statistics. We conclude that NCHS should 
report official estimates of intercensal LE for 1900-1948 computed from life 
tables in place of the existing LEs that were computed by interpolation.

To perform a health economic analysis on treatment with irbesartan in patients 
with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A Markov model was adapted to the 
Hungarian setting to simulate renal deterioration from the development of 
microalbuminuria to nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality. Outcomes for two treatments were 
evaluated: (1) a placebo regimen of standard antihypertensive medications, and 
(2) the addition of irbesartan 300 mg administered daily, with both treatment 
initiated after developing microalbuminuria. Outcomes were discounted at 5% 
annually to correspond with national guidelines. Treatment with irbesartan was 
estimated to improve undiscounted life expectancy by 0.98 +/- 0.05 years, reduce 
the cumulative incidence of ESRD by 7.5 +/- 0.4%, and reduce lifetime costs by 
Hungarian Forints (HUF) 519,993 +/- 70,814, compared to placebo. Irbesartan was 
projected to improved life expectancy and reduce costs compared to placebo in 
the Hungarian setting in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and 
microalbuminuria.

Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a pathogen inducing fatal disease in cats 
worldwide. By applying sensitive molecular assays, efficacious commonly used 
FeLV vaccines that protect cats from antigenaemia were found not to prevent 
proviral integration and minimal viral replication after challenge. Nonetheless, 
vaccines protected cats from FeLV-associated disease and prolonged life 
expectancy. The spectrum of host response categories was refined by 
investigating plasma viral RNA loads. All cats initially fought similar virus 
loads, although subsequently loads were associated with infection outcomes. 
Persistence of plasma viral RNA was moderately associated with reactivation of 
FeLV infection. In conclusion, sensitive molecular assays are important tools 
for reviewing pathogenesis of FeLV infection.

OBJECTIVES: In patients with imperative indication, organ preserving kidney 
tumour surgery is state of the art. We present our management of an extensive 
centrally located renal cell carcinoma.
METHODS: The patient was suffering from a 8x6x6cm centrally located tumour in 
the solitary left kidney which infiltrated the lower pole of the kidney, the 
hilum and built a large tumour thrombus entering the vena cava inferior. We 
performed a radical nephrectomy with cavotomy, tumour trombectomy and tumour 
resection in cold ischemia at the work bench (R0).
RESULTS: Total ischemic time took 4 h, warm ischemic time 60 min. The 
pathological tumour stage was pT3b, pN0, R0. During 17 mo of aftercare, the 
patient was free of metastatic disease and without complaints (serum creatinine 
actually 1.6 mg/dl).
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis reduces the quality of life for 30-40%, the mean 
mortality rate on hemodialysis is 13% per patient year. To prevend patients from 
hemodialysis, nephrectomy, work bench surgery and autotransplantation, even in 
large centrally located tumours and multimorbid patients should be considered to 
maintain quality and to extend expectancy of life.

Marfan syndrome.

Chaffins JA.

Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects 
the cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular systems, and often involves the skin, 
nervous system and lungs. Historically, a person with Marfan syndrome had a poor 
prognosis due to the cardiovascular effects of this disorder. The life 
expectancy has improved dramatically over the past 30 years for individuals with 
Marfan syndrome because of aggressive medical and molecular research and 
advances in surgical technology. This article discusses the history, genetics, 
manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome.

Lenalidomide has been approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent low- 
or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a 
chromosome 5q deletion with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. We 
evaluated the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide versus best supportive care 
(BSC) in these patients. We developed a decision analytic model to compare costs 
and outcomes of lenalidomide with BSC without recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) 
versus BSC with EPO over 1 year. Outcome measures were transfusion independence 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The model incorporated costs of 
medications, transfusions, chelation, laboratory tests, office visits, and other 
resources associated with each therapy. Lenalidomide therapy was associated with 
an estimated incremental 0.53 transfusion-free and 0.25 QALY gain compared to
