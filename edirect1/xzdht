With over 300 species worldwide, the genus Curculio Linnaeus, 1758 is a 
widespread, morphologically diverse lineage of weevils that mainly parasitize 
nuts. Females use the rostrum, an elongate cuticular extension of the head, to 
excavate oviposition sites. This process causes extreme bending and deformation 
of the rostrum, without apparent harm to the structure. The cuticle of the 
rostral apex exhibits substantial modifications to its composite structure that 
enhance the elasticity and resiliency of this structure. Here we develop finite 
element models of the head and rostrum for three Curculio species representing 
disparate North American clades and rostral morphotypes. The models were 
subjected to varying apical loads and to prescribed dislocation of the head 
capsule, with and without representing the cuticular modifications of the 
rostral apex. We found that the altered layer thicknesses and macrofiber 
orientation angles of the rostral apex fully explain the observed elasticity of 
the rostrum. These modifications have a synergistic effect that greatly enhances 
the flexibility of the rostral apex. Consequently, the cuticle composite profile 
of the rostral apex substantially mitigates the risk of fracture in dorso-apical 
flexion. Removing the cuticular modifications, in turn, causes a negative margin 
of safety for rostral bending, implying strong risk of catastrophic structural 
failure. The occipital sulci were identified as an important source of 
biomechanical constraint upon the elasticity of the rostrum, and exhibit the 
greatest risk of failure within this structure. The apical cuticle profile 
greatly reduced the maximum stresses and strain energy accumulated in the 
rostrum, thereby resulting in a positive margin of safety and reducing the risk 
of fracture. Our findings imply that the primary selective pressure influencing 
the evolution of the rostral cuticle was most likely negative selection of 
structural failure caused by bending. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Weevils are 
among the most diverse and evolutionarily successful animal lineages on Earth. 
Their success is driven in part by a structure called the rostrum, which gives 
weevil heads a characteristic "snout-like" appearance. Nut weevils in the genus 
Curculio use the rostrum to drill holes into developing fruits and nuts, into 
which they deposit their eggs. During oviposition this exceedingly slender 
structure is bent into a straightened configuration - in some species up to 90∘ 
- but does not suffer any damage during this process. Using finite element 
models of the rostra of three morphologically distinct species, we show that the 
Curculio rostrum is only able to withstand repeated, extreme bending because of 
modifications to the composite structure of the cuticle in the rostral apex. 
These modifications were shown previously to enhance the intrinsic toughness of 
the cuticle; in this study, we demonstrate that modification of the rostral 
cuticle also results in more evenly distributed bending stresses, further 
reducing the risk of fracture. This is the first time that the laminate profile, 
orthotropic behavior, and functional gradation of the cuticle have been 
incorporated into a three-dimensional finite element model of an insect 
cuticular structure. Our models highlight the significance of biomechanical 
constraint - i.e., avoidance of catastrophic structural failure - on the 
evolution of insect morphology.

The CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) receptor and its ligand, CXCL12, are 
overexpressed in various cancers and mediate tumor progression and 
hypoxia-mediated resistance to cancer therapy. While CXCR4 antagonists have 
potential anticancer effects when combined with conventional anticancer drugs, 
their poor potency against CXCL12/CXCR4 downstream signaling pathways and 
systemic toxicity had precluded clinical application. Herein, BPRCX807, known as 
a safe, selective, and potent CXCR4 antagonist, has been designed and 
experimentally realized. In in vitro and in vivo hepatocellular carcinoma mouse 
models it can significantly suppress primary tumor growth, prevent distant 
metastasis/cell migration, reduce angiogenesis, and normalize the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) infiltration, reprogramming TAMs toward an immunostimulatory 
phenotype and promoting cytotoxic T cell infiltration into tumor. Although 
BPRCX807 treatment alone prolongs overall survival as effectively as both 
marketed sorafenib and anti-PD-1, it could synergize with either of them in 
combination therapy to further extend life expectancy and suppress distant 
metastasis more significantly.

Oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin-producing glia in the central nervous system 
(CNS), produce a myelin extension that enwraps axons to facilitate action 
potential propagation. An effective approach to induce oligodendrogenesis and 
myelination is important to foster CNS development and promote myelin repair in 
neurological diseases. Hericium (H.) erinaceus, an edible and culinary-medicinal 
mushroom, has been characterized as having neuroprotective activities. However, 
its effect on OL differentiation has not yet been uncovered. In this study using 
oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) cultures and an ex vivo cerebellar slice 
system, we found that the extract from H. erinaceus mycelium (HEM) not only 
promoted the differentiation of OPCs to OLs in the differentiation medium, but 
also increased the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) on neuronal fibers. 
Moreover, daily oral administration of HEM into neonatal rat pups for 7 days 
enhanced MBP expression and OLs in the corpus callosum of the postnatal rat 
brain. The effect of HEM-derived bioactive compounds, the diterpenoid xylosides 
erinacine A (HeA) and HeC and a sesterterpene with 5 isoprene units called HeS, 
were further evaluated. The results showed that HeA and HeS more potently 
stimulated MBP expression in OLs and increased the number of OLs. Moreover, 
overlap between MBP immunoreactivity and neuronal fibers in cultured cerebellar 
tissue slices was significantly increased in the presence of HeA and HeS. In 
summary, our findings indicate that HEM extract and its ingredients HeA and HeS 
display promising functional effects and promote OL maturation, providing 
insights into their potential for myelination in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Between hoping to die and longing to live longer.

Drawing on Ezekiel Emanuel's controversial piece 'Why I hope to die at 75,' I 
distinguish two types of concern in ethical debates about extending the human 
lifespan. The first focusses on the value of living longer from prudential and 
social perspectives. The second type of concern, which has received less 
attention, focusses on the value of aiming for longer life. This distinction, 
which is overlooked in the ethical literature on life extension, is significant 
because there are features of human psychology and the structure of a life that 
should give pause when considering how long one should aim to live, but which do 
not neatly coincide with considerations about how valuable additional life is 
likely to be. I argue that, while Emanuel's case for hoping to die at 75 is 
unconvincing, he nonetheless provides weak pro tanto considerations in favour of 
taking a moderate life span as a prudential aim around which to base at least 
some significant life plans.

Background Only one third of patients recommended intensified treatment by the 
2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 
guideline for high blood pressure would have been eligible for the clinical 
trials on which recommendations were largely based. We sought to identify 
characteristics of adults who would have been trial-ineligible in order to 
inform clinical practice and research priorities. Methods and Results We 
examined the proportion of adults diagnosed with hypertension who met trial 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, stratified by age, diabetes mellitus status, 
and guideline recommendations in a cross-sectional study of the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2013-2016. Of the 107.7 million adults (95% 
CI, 99.3-116.0 million) classified as having hypertension by the ACC/AHA 
guideline, 23.1% (95% CI, 20.8%-25.5%) were below the target blood pressure of 
130/80 mm Hg, 22.2% (95% CI, 20.1%-24.4%) would be recommended nonpharmacologic 
treatment, and 54.6% (95% CI, 52.5%-56.7%) would be recommended additional 
pharmacotherapy. Only 20.6% (95% CI, 18.8%-22.4%) of adults with hypertension 
would be trial-eligible. The majority of adults <50 years were excluded because 
of low cardiovascular risk and lack of access to primary care. The majority of 
adults aged ≥70 years were excluded because of multimorbidity and limited life 
expectancy. Reasons for trial exclusion were similar for patients with and 
without diabetes mellitus. Conclusions Intensive blood pressure treatment trials 
were not representative of many younger adults with low cardiovascular risk and 
older adults with multimorbidity who are now recommended more intensive blood 
pressure goals.

AIMS: Although the benefit of first-line epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over chemotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive 
(EGFRm) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been demonstrated in clinical 
trials, the optimal treatment sequence remains unclear. The objective of our 
study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dacomitinib in Sweden vs 
afatinib and osimertinib in first-line treatment of EGFRm NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed with three 
health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. Progression-free 
and overall survival curves were used to inform movements between states. 
Clinical data were taken from randomized trials, compared via a network 
meta-analysis (NMA). Utility data were taken from published studies and costs 
from national Swedish sources. The model used a 15-year time horizon and a 
Swedish healthcare payer perspective. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that dacomitinib accrued a total of 2.10 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a total cost of Swedish krona (SEK) 
874,615. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for dacomitinib vs 
afatinib was SEK 461,556 per QALY gained. The ICER of osimertinib vs 
dacomitinib, where the small QALY gains of the former came at a high additional 
cost, was SEK 11,444,709. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of these results; changes to drug and medical resource 
use costs and overall survival had the greatest impact on ICER estimates.
LIMITATIONS: This model is subject to uncertainty associated with extrapolating 
long-term treatment effects from shorter trial follow-up periods, although this 
would also be a limitation when using direct comparison or time-dependent hazard 
ratios. The NMA was limited by the use of indirect comparison, although 
sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrated that dacomitinib is cost-effective for 
first-line EGFRm NSCLC treatment in Sweden vs afatinib and osimertinib.

CASE: We present a case of an 18-month-old child with early-onset scoliosis in 
the setting of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 whose rapidly progressive 
scoliosis is successfully managed with magnetic growing rods, the youngest age 
of implantation in a patient with SMA we are currently aware of. Technical 
challenges, complications, and outcome are described in this case presentation.
CONCLUSION: Patients with SMA type 1 and early-onset scoliosis can be managed 
with growing-rod constructs given dramatic improvements in medical care that 
have expanded life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-utility of a multi-professional simulation 
training programme for obstetric emergencies-Practical Obstetric 
Multi-Professional Training (PROMPT)-with a particular focus on its impact on 
permanent obstetric brachial plexus injuries (OBPIs).
DESIGN: A model-based cost-utility analysis.
SETTING: Maternity units in England.
POPULATION: Simulated cohorts of individuals affected by permanent OBPIs.
METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to estimate the cost-utility of 
adopting annual, PROMPT training (scenario 1a) or standalone shoulder dystocia 
training (scenario 1b) in all maternity units in England compared to current 
practice, where only a proportion of English units use the training programme 
(scenario 2). The time horizon was 30 years and the analysis was conducted from 
an English National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services 
perspective. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for 
uncertainties in the model parameters.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes for the entire simulated period included the 
following: total costs for PROMPT or shoulder dystocia training (including costs 
of OBPIs), number of OBPIs averted, number of affected adult/parental/dyadic 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and the incremental cost per QALY 
gained.
RESULTS: Nationwide PROMPT or shoulder dystocia training conferred significant 
savings (in excess of £1 billion ($1.5 billion)) compared to current practice, 
resulting in cost-savings of at least £1 million ($1.5 million) per any type of 
QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated similar 
findings.
CONCLUSION: In this model, national implementation of multi-professional 
simulation training for obstetric emergencies (or standalone shoulder dystocia 
training) in England appeared to both be cost-saving when evaluating their 
impact on permanent OBPIs.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to describe the worldwide epidemiology and changing 
disease trends of acute appendicitis (AA).
METHODS: Epidemiological data on the incidence of AA and deaths were collected 
from the Global Health Data Exchange repository from 1990 to 2019. Data were 
stratified by age, sex and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI).
RESULTS: In 2019, there were an estimated 17.7 million cases (incidence 
228/100,000) with over 33,400 deaths (0.43/100,000). Both the absolute number 
and the incidence had increased from 1990 to 2019 (+ 38.8% and + 11.4%, 
respectively). The number of deaths and deaths per 100,000 declined during this 
period (- 21.8% and - 46.2%, respectively). These trends were largely similar in 
all 5 SDI groups. There was a significant difference in the incidence of AA 
between the SDI groups, with low SDI group having the lowest and high SDI group 
having the highest. The high SDI group had the lowest mortality rate 
(Kruskall-Wallis test, p < 0.001). The peak incidence was in the 15-19-year age 
group. The mortality rate increased exponentially from the third decade of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate of AA is declining worldwide, while the 
incidence is increasing. The peak incidence is in the 15-19-year group.

PURPOSE: Limb salvage surgery is a surgical procedure for tumour resection in 
bone and soft-tissue cancers. Guidelines aim to preserve as much function and 
tissue of the limb as possible. Surgical outcome data is routinely available as 
part of surgical reporting processes. What is less known are important 
non-oncological outcomes throughout recovery from both clinical and patient 
perspectives. The objective of this review was to explore non-oncological 
outcomes in patients diagnosed with sarcoma around the knee following limb 
salvage surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review methodology was used, and results 
analysed using CASP checklists.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included and following appraisal and synthesis, 
three themes emerged as providing important measures intrinsic to successful 
patient recovery: (1) physical function, (2) quality of life and, (3) gait and 
knee goniometry. Specifically, patients develop range of motion complications 
that alter gait patterns and patients often limit their post-operative 
participation in sport and leisure activities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown the importance of exploring confounding 
factors, adopting a holistic view of patient recovery beyond surgical outcomes, 
proposing evidence-based guidance to support and inform healthcare providers 
with clinical decision-making. This review highlights the paucity and lack of 
quality of research available, emphasising how under-represented this population 
is in the research literature.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPatients having 
undergone LSS often have limited participation in sport and leisure 
activities.Patients can develop range of motion complications, such as flexion 
contracture or extension lag, which may affect the pattern of gait.Clinical 
consideration should be given to walking ability and gait patterns during the 
rehabilitation phase to prevent poor functional outcomes during 
recovery.Variation of treatment protocols, outcome measurement and 
rehabilitative care has been identified as important in predicting the outcomes 
in recovery from LSS procedures.

Transplantation is now performed globally as a routine procedure. However, the 
increased demand for donor organs and consequent expansion of donor criteria has 
created an imperative to maximize the quality of these gains. The goal is to 
balance preservation of allograft function against patient quality-of-life, 
despite exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Elimination of 
immunosuppressive therapy to avoid drug toxicity, with concurrent acceptance of 
the allograft-so-called operational tolerance-has proven elusive. The lack of 
recent advances in immunomodulatory drug development, together with advances in 
immunotherapy in oncology, has prompted interest in cell-based therapies to 
control the alloimmune response. Extensive experimental work in animals has 
characterized regulatory immune cell populations that can induce and maintain 
tolerance, demonstrating that their adoptive transfer can promote donor-specific 
tolerance. An extension of this large body of work has resulted in protocols for 
manufacture, as well as early-phase safety and feasibility trials for many 
regulatory cell types. Despite the excitement generated by early clinical trials 
in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation, there is as yet no clinically 
validated, approved regulatory cell therapy for transplantation. In this review, 
we summarize recent advances in this field, with a focus on myeloid and 
mesenchymal cell therapies, including current understanding of the mechanisms of 
action of regulatory immune cells, and clinical trials in organ transplantation 
using these cells as therapeutics.

Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease is a significant cause of stroke in the 
United States and globally. Its prevalence increases with age and it is more 
prevalent in men and White and Native-American populations. However, the 
outcomes related to carotid disease are worse in women and Black patients. 
Research suggests the disparities exist due to a multitude of factors, including 
disease pathophysiology, access to care, provider bias, and socioeconomic 
status. The prevalence of carotid stenosis in the general population is low 
(3%), and routine screening for carotid stenosis is not recommended in adults. 
Randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of stroke risk reduction with 
surgery (carotid endarterectomy or stenting) for symptomatic patients. 
Management is controversial in asymptomatic patients, as modern medical 
management has results equivalent to those of surgery and ongoing randomized 
clinical trials will address this important question. Carotid surgery is not 
appropriate in asymptomatic patients with limited life expectancy. Future work 
should explore comprehensive care models for care of patients with carotid 
disease and assessment of patient-reported outcomes to measure quality of care.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dual influenza and pneumococcal 
vaccination for the elderly in Shenzhen, China.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model with a weekly cycle was developed to 
compare the outcomes of dual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for the 
prevention of influenza and pneumococcal infections compared with no vaccination 
among 70-74 years old people in Shenzhen over 5 years. The model allowed 
seasonal variation of influenza activity. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) discounted at 5% annually from the societal perspective. The impact of 
parameter uncertainty on the results was examined using one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: In the base case, dual vaccination prevented 5042 influenza infections, 
26 IPD cases, 3 disabilities, 34 deaths, and cost US$7.1 per person while 
resulting in a net gain of 0.0026 QALYs compared with no vaccination. Using once 
the Chinese gross domestic product per capita in 2019 (US$10,289) as the 
willingness-to-pay threshold, dual vaccination was cost-effective with an ICER 
of US$2699 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER 
was relatively sensitive to changes in influenza attack rates and influenza 
vaccine effectiveness. Based on the results of PSA with 1000 Monte Carlo 
simulations, receiving both vaccines was cost-effective in 100% of the 
repetitions.
CONCLUSION: The current study provides evidence that dual influenza and 
pneumococcal vaccination is a cost-effective disease prevention strategy for the 
elderly in Shenzhen, China.

Producing colored signals often requires consuming dietary carotenoid pigments. 
Evidence that food deprivation can reduce coloration, however, raises the 
question of whether other dietary nutrients contribute to signal coloration, and 
furthermore, whether individuals can voluntarily select food combinations to 
achieve optimal coloration. We created a two-way factorial design to manipulate 
macronutrient and carotenoid access in common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and 
measured eye patch coloration as a function of the food combinations individuals 
selected. Mynas had access to either water or carotenoid-supplemented water and 
could either eat a standard captive diet or choose freely between three 
nutritionally defined pellets (protein, lipid or carbohydrate). Mynas 
supplemented with both carotenoids and macronutrient pellets had higher color 
scores than control birds. Male coloration tended to respond more to nutritional 
manipulation than females, with color scores improving in macronutrient- and 
carotenoid-supplemented individuals compared with controls. All mynas consuming 
carotenoids had higher levels of plasma carotenoids, but only males showed a 
significant increase by the end of the experiment. Dietary carotenoids and 
macronutrient intake consumed in combination tended to increase plasma 
carotenoid concentrations the most. These results demonstrate for the first time 
that consuming specific combinations of macronutrients along with carotenoids 
contributes to optimizing a colorful signal, and point to sex-specific 
nutritional strategies. Our findings improve our knowledge of how diet choices 
affect signal expression and, by extension, how nutritionally impoverished 
diets, such as those consumed by birds in cities, might affect sexual selection 
processes and, ultimately, population dynamics.

Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Based Regimen in Ethiopia: A Hospital-Based 
Cross-Sectional Study.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of HIV patients has increased by the extensive use 
of antiretroviral therapies (ART), but ART predisposes patients to chronic 
non-communicable diseases including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate is one of the commonly used drugs in ART and is found to 
have more risk for developing CKD. In the study areas, there was no previous 
study addressing the prevalence of CKD, so the purpose of this study was to 
pinpoint the prevalence of CKD, and its associated factors.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed at Tikur Anbessa 
Specialized Hospital (TASH) and Zewuditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH) from April 1 to 
June 30, 2019. The study participants were proportionally allocated to each 
hospital and a total of 243 eligible participants were selected conveniently 
from the two hospitals in the study period. Structured questionnaire and 
checklist were used to collect socio-demographic and clinical data of the 
participants. Blood samples (3-5 ml) were used to determine serum creatinine 
using calibrated fully automated Mind ray BS-200E, and glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR) was estimated using a chronic kidney disease epidemiology equation. 
Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated 
with CKD, and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: In the present study, the prevalence of CKD (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) 
was 4.53% (95% CI = 2.3-8%). GFR was classified into stages, stage 5 (GFR <15), 
stage 4 (15-29.9), stage 3 (30-59.9), stage 2 (60-89.9), and stage 1 (≥90) were 
0%, 0.4%, 4.1%, 38.3%, and 57.2%, respectively. In the multivariate logistic 
regression, age greater than 50 years old, and having cancer were significantly 
associated with CKD (AOR: 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05-0.88, P = 0.033, and AOR: 18.20, 
95% CI = 122-271.77, P = 0.035, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients receiving a 
TDF-based regimen requires attention. Age >50 years old, and having cancer as 
comorbidity were significantly associated with chronic kidney disease. Patients 
should be regularly monitored for early diagnosis and management of chronic 
kidney disease in a TDF-based regimen.

Background When researching female patients with breast or ovarian neoplasms, 
our research will sensitize oncologists to the prevalence of biliary tract 
cancers such that early cancers are not overlooked. Depending on different 
inherited, environmental, and iatrogenic risk factors, patients diagnosed with 
cancer have a risk of harboring another de novo malignancy. The additional 
primary identification of late has increased mainly due to progress in both 
diagnosis and treatment modalities, improvement in life expectancy, and 
understanding. Methods This is a descriptive study of retrospectively collected 
data from health records over 15 months, of patients who had biliary tract 
cancer and incidentally detected coexisting second non-biliary malignancy, from 
July 2018 to September 2019 at a tertiary care hospital. Details such as age, 
sex, smoking history, family history, occupation, body mass index (BMI), the 
organ involved, levels of tumor markers, treatment, and outcome were recorded. 
Results Six consecutive patients with biliary tract cancer presented during this 
duration and incidentally detected the second primary was ovarian cancer in 
three (50%) patients, breast carcinoma in two (33%) patients, and urinary 
bladder carcinoma in the remaining one patient (17%). The median age at 
diagnosis was 52.5 years with a range of 40-65 years. All patients were females 
(100%), non-smokers, homemaker, and without any history of cancer in family 
members. Only two patients who had a resectable disease were alive at one year's 
follow-up. Conclusion The mechanisms of carcinogenesis in multiple primary 
malignancies are mainly genetic, epigenetics, and immunological. Prognosis, as 
well as the intent of treatment, depends on the respective stages of the two 
malignancies. In our study, most of the patients were in an advanced stage that 
demanded palliative care.

University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, Calif.

Early-onset carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a well-known manifestation of 
mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) due to excessive deposition of glycosaminoglycans in 
soft tissues. Standard treatment has been carpal tunnel release surgery, with 
the conventional technique of dividing the transverse carpal ligament. With 
advancement of treatments for MPS, these patients now have a longer life 
expectancy and are presenting with recurrent CTS. Management of recurrent CTS in 
these patients is not well studied. Here, we report 2 cases of recurrent CTS in 
MPS patients after a carpal tunnel release operation. We describe the findings 
on repeat operations and propose a unique technique for treating CTS in MPS 
patients to minimize recurrence during the initial CTS surgery. Our method 
involves resection of a portion of the transverse carpal ligament and use of a 
hypothenar fat pad flap over the median nerve.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the association between familial 
Mediterranean fever (FMF) and cachexia in females.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 32 female FMF patients (median age 
27.50 years; range, 18 to 50 years) and 30 female healthy controls (median age 
32 years; range, 18 to 50 years). Patients were classified according to 
Tel-Hashomer criteria. Circumference of arm, waist, and thigh was recorded. 
Short form 36 (SF-36) and Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale 
were applied. Composition of the body was measured with dual X-ray absorption. 
Muscle strength was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer, and strength of 
hand grip was measured from dominant hand with a hand dynamometer. C-reactive 
protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen and serum creatinine kinase 
(CK) levels were recorded.
RESULTS: Body mass index was significantly higher in controls. Twelve patients 
and one control had cachexia. CK level was significantly higher in patients than 
controls. Mass of muscle without fat was significantly higher in patients than 
controls. Peak torque values of extension and flexion at the velocity of 
60°/second [Newton meter (Nm)], and value of total work during extension at the 
velocity of 240°/second (Nm) in isokinetic measures were significantly higher in 
controls. MAF score was significantly higher in patients with cachexia than 
patients without cachexia where the subscale scores of SF-36, except the 
vitality score, were significantly lower in patients with cachexia. However, 
Tel-Hashomer score was significantly higher in patients with cachexia.
CONCLUSION: This study pointed at a significant association between cachexia and 
FMF in females. Muscle endurance was not affected in FMF patients with cachexia; 
however, decreased muscle strength, impaired quality of life and increased 
fatigue were observed in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Xenotransplantation has made tremendous progress over the last 
decade.
METHODS: We discuss kidney and heart xenotransplantation, which are nearing 
initial clinical trials.
RESULTS: Life sustaining genetically modified kidney xenografts can now last for 
approximately 500 days and orthotopic heart xenografts for 200 days in non-human 
primates. Anti-swine specific antibody screening, preemptive desensitization 
protocols, complement inhibition and targeted immunosuppression are currently 
being adapted to xenotransplantation with the hope to achieve better control of 
antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and improve xenograft longevity. These newest 
advances could probably facilitate future clinical trials, a significant step 
for the medical community, given that dialysis remains difficult for many 
patients and can have prohibitive costs. Performing a successful pig-to-human 
clinical kidney xenograft, that could last for more than a year after 
transplant, seems feasible but it still has significant potential hurdles to 
overcome. The risk/benefit balance is progressively reaching an acceptable 
equilibrium for future human recipients, e.g. those with a life expectancy 
inferior to two years. The ultimate question at this stage would be to determine 
if a "proof of concept" in humans is desirable, or whether further 
experimental/pre-clinical advances are still needed to demonstrate longer 
xenograft survival in non-human primates.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in kidney and 
heart xenotransplantation, with a focus on the prevention and treatment of AMR 
and on the recipient's selection, two aspects that will likely be the major 
points of discussion in the first pig organ xenotransplantation clinical trials.

Assessment of Cardiometabolic Health, Diet and Physical Activity in Helicopter 
Rescue Paramedics.

Meadley B, Perraton L, Smith K, Bonham MP, Bowles KA.

Objective: Shift work is an established risk factor for weight gain, 
cardiovascular disease, Type II diabetes mellitus, and impaired health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). Prolonged exposure to shift work is common in 
paramedics and other emergency medical service (EMS) providers. Sub-populations 
of EMS workers may have varying health outcomes when exposed to shift work, but 
the reasons for this have not been investigated. We sought to describe 
cardiometabolic health, dietary patterns, physical activity, and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in a sample of experienced intensive care flight 
paramedics (ICFPs) working for a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service 
(HEMS).Methods: Fifteen paramedics (median age 45, IQR 42-48 years) were 
recruited to undertake a range of health assessments. These included a food 
frequency questionnaire to assess dietary patterns, sampling of biomarkers to 
determine cardiometabolic health risk, maximal aerobic capacity assessment via 
treadmill running and assessment of HRQoL via the SF-36 survey. In an extension 
of the study protocol, ten of the fifteen participants wore a physical activity 
monitor for one year.Results: Median (IQR) weight was 79.9 (72.3-89.3) kg, body 
fat percentage 23.3 (21.9-26.5) %, body mass index (BMI) 25.1 (21.9-27.4) kg.m2, 
and waist to height ratio 0.48 (0.45-0.54). Dietary analyses showed high 
discretionary food intake. Biomarkers of cardiometabolic health risk were all 
within normal range. HRQoL was 86.2/100 for physical health and 85.1/100 for 
mental health. V̇O2max was 47.0 (43.0-54.6) mL.kg-1.min-1. The ten participants 
that wore activity monitors completed 11,235 (8334-15,380) steps per day and 
undertook 50 (12-98) minutes per day/350 (84-686) minutes per week of moderate 
to vigorous physical activity. The least amount of physical activity was 
conducted on day shifts.Conclusions: For ICFPs included in this study, HRQoL, 
cardiometabolic and physical activity outcomes are representative of good 
health. Although shift work influences the amount of physical activity, ICFPs 
exceeded minimum recommendations even when rostered to duty. Despite lengthy 
careers in EMS, ICFPs demonstrate an excellent health profile that is likely due 
to high physical activity levels and healthy BMI. This information may be useful 
in guiding health interventions in the wider EMS workforce.
