Inbreeding poses a real or potential threat to nearly every species of 
conservation concern. Inbreeding leads to loss of diversity at the individual 
level, which can cause inbreeding depression, and at the population level, which 
can hinder ability to respond to a changing environment. In closed populations 
such as endangered species and ex situ breeding programs, some degree of 
inbreeding is inevitable. It is therefore vital to understand how different 
patterns of breeding and inbreeding can affect fitness in real animals. Domestic 
dogs provide an excellent model, showing dramatic variation in degree of 
inbreeding and in lifespan, an important aspect of fitness that is known to be 
impacted by inbreeding in other species. There is a strong negative correlation 
between body size and lifespan in dogs, but it is unknown whether the higher 
rate of aging in large dogs is due to body size per se or some other factor 
associated with large size. We used dense genome-wide SNP array data to 
calculate average inbreeding for over 100 dog breeds based on autozygous segment 
length and found that large breeds tend to have higher coefficients of 
inbreeding than small breeds. We then used data from the Veterinary medical 
Database and other published sources to estimate life expectancies for pure and 
mixed breed dogs. When controlling for size, variation in inbreeding was not 
associated with life expectancy across breeds. When comparing mixed versus 
purebred dogs, however, mixed breed dogs lived about 1.2 years longer on average 
than size-matched purebred dogs. Furthermore, individual pedigree coefficients 
of inbreeding and lifespans for over 9000 golden retrievers showed that 
inbreeding does negatively impact lifespan at the individual level. Registration 
data from the American Kennel Club suggest that the molecular inbreeding 
patterns observed in purebred dogs result from specific breeding practices 
and/or founder effects and not the current population size. Our results suggest 
that recent inbreeding, as reflected in variation within a breed, is more likely 
to affect fitness than historic inbreeding, as reflected in variation among 
breeds. Our results also indicate that occasional outcrosses, as in mixed breed 
dogs, can have a substantial positive effect on fitness.

Runaway brain-culture coevolution as a reason for larger brains: Exploring the 
"cultural drive" hypothesis by computer modeling.

Scale and tempo of brain expansion in the course of human evolution implies that 
this process was driven by a positive feedback. The "cultural drive" hypothesis 
suggests a possible mechanism for the runaway brain-culture coevolution wherein 
high-fidelity social learning results in accumulation of cultural traditions 
which, in turn, promote selection for still more efficient social learning. Here 
we explore this evolutionary mechanism by means of computer modeling. 
Simulations confirm its plausibility in a social species in a socio-ecological 
situation that makes the sporadic invention of new beneficial and cognitively 
demanding behaviors possible. The chances for the runaway brain-culture 
coevolution increase when some of the culturally transmitted behaviors are 
individually beneficial while the others are group-beneficial. In this case, 
"cultural drive" is possible under varying levels of between-group competition 
and migration. Modeling implies that brain expansion can receive additional 
boost if the evolving mechanisms of social learning are costly in terms of brain 
expansion (e.g., rely on complex neuronal circuits) and tolerant to the 
complexity of information transferred, that is, make it possible to transfer 
complex skills and concepts easily. Human language presumably fits this 
description. Modeling also confirms that the runaway brain-culture coevolution 
can be accelerated by additional positive feedback loops via population growth 
and life span extension, and that between-group competition and cultural group 
selection can facilitate the propagation of group-beneficial behaviors and 
remove maladaptive cultural traditions from the population's culture, which 
individual selection is unable to do.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research examining how surgical 
decision-making for metastatic bone disease (MBD) can be optimized to improve 
quality of life (QOL) and functional outcomes, while accurately aligning with 
patient goals and expectations. The objective of this study was to survey and 
interview patients with MBD and support persons (PS), physicians, and allied 
health care providers (HCP) with the goal of identifying (1) important surgical 
issues related to MBD management, (2) discordance in perioperative expectations, 
and (3) perceived measures of success in the surgical management of MBD.
METHODS: Utilizing a custom survey developed by HCP and patients with MBD, 
participants were asked to (1) identify important issues related to MBD 
management, (2) rank perceived measures of success, and (3) answer open-ended 
questions pertaining to the management of MBD.
RESULTS: From the survey, increased life expectancy, minimizing disease 
progression, removal of local tumour, timely surgery after diagnosis, increased 
length of hospitalization, and physiotherapy access were all identified as 
significant discordant goals between PS and physicians/HCP. Conversely, there 
was an agreement between physicians and HCP who considered improved QOL and 
functional outcomes as most important goals. Structured homogenous-group 
workshops identified the need for (1) improved discussions of prognosis, 
surgical options, expectations, timelines, and resources, (2) the use of a care 
team "quarterback", and (3) an increased use of multi-disciplinary treatment 
planning.
CONCLUSIONS: We feel this data highlights the importance of improved 
communication and coordination in treating patients with MBD. Further research 
evaluating how surgical techniques influence survival and disease progression in 
MBD is highly relevant and important to patients.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery is a multimodal and evidence-based perioperative 
approach with the aim to improve postoperative outcome. Following successful 
results in colorectal surgery, the implementation of enhanced recovery has 
spread to many surgical disciplines including pancreatic surgery.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to review current evidence on enhanced 
recovery focusing on pancreatic cancer surgery and to discuss potential areas of 
further development.
CONCLUSION: In pancreatic cancer surgery, enhanced recovery is associated with 
better clinical outcome, especially reduced overall postoperative complications, 
and reduced length of stay without any increase in readmission rate. The 
occurrence of delayed gastric emptying, but not pancreatic fistula, seems to be 
reduced with enhanced recovery. The improved postoperative outcome correlates 
with net costs savings. The improvement of clinical outcome was mainly described 
for short-term complications. The extension to long-term outcome and survival 
benefits, as well as the impact on quality of life, remains to be determined.

The purpose of this study was to examine the degree to which the magnitude of 
income inequality in life expectancy according to different categorization 
across beneficiary types under the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in 
Korea. We used population and death data in 2017 from the National Health 
Information Database of the NHIS. Income quintile groups were classified in four 
ways according to beneficiary type (employee insured, self-employed insured, and 
Medical Aid beneficiaries). Standard life table procedures were used to 
calculate life expectancy. The life expectancy gap between the lowest and 
highest income quintiles was the largest when the entire population was divided 
into quintiles without distinguishing among types of beneficiaries. In 
conclusion, we suggest that income quintile indicators in NHIS data, measured 
without distinguishing among types of beneficiaries, may best represent the 
magnitude of health inequalities in Korean society. This indicator could be used 
for future research on health inequalities, as well as for monitoring health 
inequalities in Korea.

How to Address Uncertainty in Health Economic Discrete-Event Simulation Models: 
An Illustration for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Background. Evaluation of personalized treatment options requires health 
economic models that include multiple patient characteristics. Patient-level 
discrete-event simulation (DES) models are deemed appropriate because of their 
ability to simulate a variety of characteristics and treatment pathways. 
However, DES models are scarce in the literature, and details about their 
methods are often missing. Methods. We describe 4 challenges associated with 
modeling heterogeneity and structural, stochastic, and parameter uncertainty 
that can be encountered during the development of DES models. We explain why 
these are important and how to correctly implement them. To illustrate the 
impact of the modeling choices discussed, we use (results of) a model for 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a case study. Results. The 
results from the case study showed that, under a correct implementation of the 
uncertainty in the model, a hypothetical intervention can be deemed as 
cost-effective. The consequences of incorrect modeling uncertainty included an 
increase in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 50% to almost 
a factor of 14, an extended life expectancy of approximately 1.4 years, and an 
enormously increased uncertainty around the model outcomes. Thus, modeling 
uncertainty incorrectly can have substantial implications for decision making. 
Conclusions. This article provides guidance on the implementation of uncertainty 
in DES models and improves the transparency of reporting uncertainty methods. 
The COPD case study illustrates the issues described in the article and helps 
understanding them better. The model R code shows how the uncertainty was 
implemented. For readers not familiar with R, the model's pseudo-code can be 
used to understand how the model works. By doing this, we can help other 
developers, who are likely to face similar challenges to those described here.

BACKGROUND: Relatives caring for people with severe mental health problems find 
information and emotional support hard to access. Online support for 
self-management offers a potential solution.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of an online supported self-management tool for relatives: 
the Relatives' Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT).
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a primarily online (UK), single-blind, randomised 
controlled trial, comparing REACT plus a resource directory and treatment as 
usual with the resource directory and treatment as usual only, by measuring user 
distress and other well-being measures at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 800 relatives of people with severe mental health 
problems across the UK took part; relatives who were aged ≥ 16 years, were 
experiencing high levels of distress, had access to the internet and were 
actively seeking help were recruited.
INTERVENTION: REACT comprised 12 psychoeducation modules, peer support through a 
group forum, confidential messaging and a comprehensive resource directory of 
national support. Trained relatives moderated the forum and responded to 
messages.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome was the level of participants' distress, 
as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-28 items.
RESULTS: Various online and offline strategies, including social media, directed 
potential participants to the website. Participants were randomised to one of 
two arms: REACT plus the resource directory (n = 399) or the resource directory 
only (n = 401). Retention at 24 weeks was 75% (REACT arm, n = 292; resource 
directory-only arm, n = 307). The mean scores for the General Health 
Questionnaire-28 items reduced substantially across both arms over 24 weeks, 
from 40.2 (standard deviation 14.3) to 30.5 (standard deviation 15.6), with no 
significant difference between arms (mean difference -1.39, 95% confidence 
interval -3.60 to 0.83; p = 0.22). At 12 weeks, the General Health 
Questionnaire-28 items scores were lower in the REACT arm than in the resource 
directory-only arm (-2.08, 95% confidence interval -4.14 to -0.03; p = 0.027), 
but this finding is likely to be of limited clinical significance. Accounting 
for missing data, which were associated with higher distress in the REACT arm 
(0.33, 95% confidence interval -0.27 to 0.93; p = 0.279), in a longitudinal 
model, there was no significant difference between arms over 24 weeks (-0.56, 
95% confidence interval -2.34 to 1.22; p = 0.51). REACT cost £142.95 per 
participant to design and deliver (£62.27 for delivery only), compared with 
£0.84 for the resource directory only. A health economic analysis of NHS, health 
and Personal Social Services outcomes found that REACT has higher costs 
(£286.77), slightly better General Health Questionnaire-28 items scores 
(incremental General Health Questionnaire-28 items score adjusted for baseline, 
age and gender: -1.152, 95% confidence interval -3.370 to 1.065) and slightly 
lower quality-adjusted life-year gains than the resource directory only; none of 
these differences was statistically significant. The median time spent online 
was 50.8 minutes (interquartile range 12.4-172.1 minutes) for REACT, with no 
significant association with outcome. Participants reported finding REACT a 
safe, confidential environment (96%) and reported feeling supported by the forum 
(89%) and the REACT supporters (86%). No serious adverse events were reported.
LIMITATIONS: The sample comprised predominantly white British females, 25% of 
participants were lost to follow-up and dropout in the REACT arm was not random.
CONCLUSIONS: An online self-management support toolkit with a moderated group 
forum is acceptable to relatives and, compared with face-to-face programmes, 
offers inexpensive, safe delivery of National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence-recommended support to engage relatives as peers in care delivery. 
However, currently, REACT plus the resource directory is no more effective at 
reducing relatives' distress than the resource directory only.
FUTURE WORK: Further research in improving the effectiveness of online carer 
support interventions is required.

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Relatives of people with severe mental health problems 
need better access to information and emotional support. The Relatives’ 
Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT) is a website designed to do this. It 
includes lots of information presented in text and video, an online forum for 
relatives to share knowledge and experience, a messaging system where they can 
ask questions in confidence and a comprehensive directory of contact details for 
national organisations offering relevant support. Trained relatives support the 
forum and messaging. In the UK, we recruited 800 relatives of people with severe 
mental health problems: all were aged ≥ 16 years, had high levels of distress, 
had access to the internet and wanted help. We divided them into two equal 
groups: one group received REACT (including the resource directory), whereas the 
other group received the resource directory only. To ensure that there were no 
differences between groups at the start, relatives were allocated to the two 
groups randomly, so they had an equal chance of being in either group. We 
followed up with both groups at 12 and 24 weeks, and received data from 
approximately three-quarters of the participants. This trial found that REACT 
was acceptable, safe and inexpensive to deliver (£62.27 per relative), compared 
with face-to-face interventions, and that relatives using it felt well 
supported. However, once we accounted for missing data (relatives who dropped 
out of the trial or did not complete the follow-up questionnaires), there were 
no significant differences between the groups. There was no evidence that REACT 
increased relatives’ quality of life or saved money for the NHS.

The dance of cystic fibrosis: Experiences of living with cystic fibrosis as an 
adult.

Falls, SD, USA.

City, SD, USA.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study sought to understand the experience of living 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) as an adult.
BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is one of the most difficult chronic diseases to 
manage long term because of numerous challenges faced on a day-to-day basis. The 
majority of studies focus on improving symptom response to new treatment 
regimens with the hope of prolonging life. Yet few qualitative studies explore 
the experience of adults with CF. What is missing from the current literature 
are the voices of people living with CF, especially as they age.
DESIGN: This study follows a hermeneutic phenomenology design guided by Martin 
Heidegger's philosophy.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine adults living with 
CF. Hermeneutic phenomenology guided the data interpretation. This manuscript 
follows COREQ reporting guidelines.
RESULTS: Hermeneutic analysis revealed the overarching theme The Dance of Cystic 
Fibrosis which is supported by five themes: (a) the paradox of control, (b) 
living deaths, (c) dancing with death, (d) relearning to dance, and (e) role of 
the dance partner.
CONCLUSIONS: The experience of living with CF as an adult is multidimensional 
and unique to each person. Despite the uniqueness, there is a shared experience 
that manifested as The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis. As life expectancy continues to 
increase for persons with CF, it is essential that researchers and healthcare 
professionals intentionally consider the life-prolonging effects of the 
treatment regimen alongside the persons' experience with those effects.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses at all levels of practice should be 
prepared to address the multifaceted experience of living with CF through 
thoughtful incorporation of open-ended questions. This allows patients to share 
their experience with nurses, augmenting their practice of delivering holistic 
care.

In Colombia, dengue is a disease of great impact due to its morbidity and 
mortality, however, studies on the effects of the economic burden at the local 
level are scarce. Therefore, our study sought to describe the economic burden of 
dengue epidemics between 2010 and 2016 in the State of Meta, Colombia. A 
longitudinal study was performed using information from the records of the 
epidemiological information system (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia en Salud 
Pública - SIVIGILA), and the indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
was determined as an estimator of the burden of dengue. To assess the economic 
impact, two assessment scenarios were considered (minimum range and maximum 
range), which allowed the estimate of the effects of the years of life lost 
(YLLs). Mortality cases presented heterogeneity in the age groups, mainly 
affecting groups under 15 years and over 65 years, with YLLs raging between 
158.58 and 300.38. In total, 2010 showed the highest medical care costs of the 
study period, with USD 664,123 for women and USD 740,221 for men. In the 
epidemic years (2010, 2012-2015) between 91,072.3 and 184,175.1 DALYs were lost 
per million inhabitants, which generated social burden costs higher than the USD 
669.6 million. In conclusion, dengue can be considered a disease of high cost at 
the local level, economically affecting the General Social Security System in 
Health and social welfare.

Oral impairments can affect overall health and life expectancy in older adults. 
Our study evaluates the life expectancy with negative physical oral health 
impact on quality of life (POHIQoL) among older adults. Life expectancy with 
negative POHIQoL was estimated by the Sullivan method, using the prevalence of 
POHIQoL - obtained in the Health, Well-being and Ageing (SABE Study); and 
official mortality data for adults aged 60 years or older living in São Paulo, 
Brazil. Between 2000 and 2010, negative POHIQoL increased from 23.4% (95%CI: 
20.2-26.9) to 30.4% (95%CI: 27.0-34.3) among older adults; total life expectancy 
increased from 22 and 17.5 to 23.7 and 19.4 years among 60-year-old women and 
men, respectively; and the proportion of remaining years to be lived with 
negative POHIQoL increased from 25.1% to 32.1% for the same age group. In both 
years, individuals aged 60 years with lower education level were expected to 
live more years with negative POHIQoL when compared with the most schooled ones 
(2000: 15.9 [95%CI: 15.0-16.8] vs. 14.3 [95%CI: 13.7-14.8]; 2010: 16.3 [95%CI: 
15.1-17.4] vs. 14.1 [95%CI: 13.2-15.1]). Similarly, women were expected to live 
more years with negative POHIQoL than men. Within ten years, life expectancy 
with negative POHIQoL increased, as well as the existence of inequalities in sex 
and education level among Brazilian older adults. Expansion in coverage and 
focus on equity in dental care are still necessary to overcome persistent 
dental-related problems and inequalities and, therefore, contribute to healthy 
ageing.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic 
variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that predispose individuals to different 
malignancies, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. Current 
guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to 
reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in 
support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a 
decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from 
the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: 
the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a 
sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy 
with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific 
MLPA for patients ≥ than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to 
the "no testing" strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives 
after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological 
surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence 
rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number 
of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 
910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies 
investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC 
patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between 
€1,753,059.93-€10,388,000.00. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the 
Markov model ranged from €941.24 /QALY to €1,681.93 /QALY, thus supporting that 
"universal testing" versus "no testing" is cost-effective, but not necessarily 
in comparison with age-targeted strategies. This is the first economic 
evaluation on different testing strategies for LS in Italy. The results might 
support the introduction of cost-effective recommendations for LS screening in 
Italy.

Background: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) is one of the most 
common yet preventable occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to 
estimate the economic burden of ONIHL in the Australian working population by 
quantifying and monetising ONIHL-related loss of Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALY) and Productivity Adjusted Life Years (PALYs). Methods: We simulated the 
number of moderate-to-severe ONIHL by multiplying the age-specific prevalence of 
occupational noise exposure by the excess risks of ONIHL. Life table modelling 
was applied to workers with ONIHL. The QALY and PALY weights attributable to 
hearing loss were sourced from published data. The 2016 Gross Domestic Product 
per full-time equivalent worker in Australia was used to estimate the cost of 
productivity loss due to ONIHL. The cost due to the loss of well-being was 
quantified using willingness to pay thresholds derived from an Australian 
longitudinal study. Results: Under current occupational noise exposure levels in 
Australia, we estimated that over 80,000 male workers and over 31,000 female 
workers would develop ONIHL over 10 years of exposure. Following this cohort 
until the age of 65 years, the estimated loss of QALYs and PALYs were 62,218 and 
135,561 respectively, with a projected loss of AUD 5.5 billion and AUD 21.3 
billion due to well-being and productivity loss, respectively. Reducing noise 
exposure at work would substantially reduce the economic burden of ONIHL. 
Conclusion: ONIHL imposes substantial burden on Australian economy. 
Interventions to reduce occupational noise exposure are warranted.

BACKGROUND: In light of worrying public health developments such as declining 
life expectancy gains and increasing health inequalities, there is a heightened 
interest in the relationship between politics and health. This scoping review 
explores the possible welfare policy consequences of populist radical right 
(PRR) parties in Europe and the implications for population health. The aim is 
to map the available empirical evidence regarding the influence of PRR parties 
on welfare policy reforms and to understand how this relationship is mediated by 
political system characteristics in different countries.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed empirical literature 
addressing the relationship between PRR parties, political systems and welfare 
policy in Europe was performed using the methodology by the Joanna Briggs 
Institute. Data was charted on main study characteristics, concepts and relevant 
results, after which a qualitative content analysis was performed. The data was 
categorised according to the political system characteristics: constitution, 
political economy, interest representation and partisanship. Five expert 
interviews were conducted for validation purposes. Early evidence from 15 
peer-reviewed articles suggests that exclusionary welfare chauvinistic positions 
of PRR parties are likely to have negative effects on the access to welfare 
provisions and health of vulnerable population groups. Differences in 
implementation of welfare chauvinistic policy reforms are partly explained by 
mediation of the constitutional order (judicial institutions at national and 
European Union [EU] level), political economy (healthcare system funding and 
European single market) and partisanship (vote-seeking strategies by PRR and 
mainstream parties). No clear evidence was found regarding the influence of 
interest representation on welfare chauvinistic policies.
DISCUSSION: While early evidence suggests that the welfare chauvinistic ideology 
of PRR parties is harmful for public health, the possible mediating role of 
political system characteristics on PRR welfare policy influence offers risk and 
protective factors explaining why the PRR ideology plays out differently across 
Europe.

Kong and Japan.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and life disparity are 2 useful indicators to assess 
the health condition of a society. Both Hong Kong and Japan have one of the 
longest life expectancies in the world. Recently, Hong Kong has overtaken Japan 
and topped the life expectancy rankings. However, whether Hong Kong has also 
outperformed Japan in life disparity is still unknown.
METHODS: Decomposition analyses have been conducted to evaluate age-specific 
contributions to the changes in life expectancy and life disparity for each of 
the populations. Furthermore, the differences between the 2 populations were 
examined over the period 1977-2016.
RESULTS: Reduction in mortality of the adult and the old age groups contributes 
most to the increase in life expectancy for the study period. Hong Kong has a 
higher life disparity than Japan, and due to the great improvement in reducing 
premature deaths, the Hong Kong-Japan gap has been narrowing. However, in recent 
years, further reduction in mortality of the oldest elderly in Hong Kong has 
actually contributed to the increase in its disparity, thus widening its gap 
with Japan again.
CONCLUSION: Increasing dominant influence of "saving lives at late ages" is very 
likely to cause the reemergence of increasing life disparity in these 2 
long-lived populations.

The present study aimed to develop a novel active edible film based on gelatin 
incorporated with 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9% w/w anise essential oil as a natural 
preservative and investigate the shelf life extension potential of chicken 
fillets during 12 days of refrigerated storage. The chicken fillets were wrapped 
with the essence-free and anise essential oil-loaded gelatin films, and 
microbial counts, chemical and sensory tests were surveyed during chilled 
storage. Results showed that aerobic mesophilic bacteria and Pseudomonas spp 
counts significantly decreased at all levels of anise essential oil during the 
first week of storage, while psychrotrophs, yeasts, and molds numbers began to 
reduce at concentrations of 0.6 and 0.9% from day 6. The using of anise 
essential oil caused a significant decrease of chemical parameters of chicken 
fillets, and the values of pH, peroxide, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, 
and total volatile basic-nitrogen reached from 7.42, 5.7 meq/kg, 2.21 mg 
malondialdehyde/kg, and 24.94 mg N/100 g for the essence-free wrapped samples to 
4.8, 6.35 meq/kg, 1.73 mg malondialdehyde/kg, and 18.78 mg N/100 g for the ones 
wrapped with 0.9% anise essential oil-loaded gelatin films at the end of storage 
day. In conclusion, application of gelatin films loaded with 0.6 and 0.9% anise 
essential oil can be advised for wrapping chicken fillets to prolong the shelf 
life for at least one week.

OBJECTIVE: In the last decades, life expectancy has increased worldwide 
considerably. Traditionally, very elderly patients have been considered too 
frail to undergo major vascular interventions. Considering that abdominal aortic 
aneurysm is an age-related disease, there is an increasing need of a correct 
management of the disease even in nonagenarians, but data are still scarce. The 
purpose of this single-centre study is to report early and mid-term outcomes of 
all-comer abdominal aortic aneurysm patients in their 10th decades of age.
METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database 
identified a total of 33 patients aged ≥ 90 presenting with abdominal aortic 
aneurysm between 2014 and 2019. Elective and emergency repairs were both 
considered. Early technical success and mortality rate at 30 days were 
considered as primary outcomes. Mid-term clinical success was reported, and 
overall survival, freedom from aneurysm-related death, re-interventions and 
endoleaks were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, stratified for elective 
of emergency repair and type of treatment.
RESULTS: The mean age was 91.7 (range 90-96), and 63.6% were male. Mean 
abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was 67.4 ± 16.8 mm. Sixteen patients were 
admitted for rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm: three untreated, five underwent 
open and seven underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), with an early 
mortality rate of 100, 100 and 42.8%, respectively. Eighteen (60%) patients were 
asymptomatic, and all underwent elective EVAR, with an early mortality rate of 
0%. At one-month follow-up, clinical success was 84% in EVAR group. At a median 
follow-up of 22.4 ± 14.5 months, no abdominal aortic aneurysm-related death was 
registered. Freedom from all cause of mortality was 77.3, 59.4 and 40.7% at one, 
two and three years. Freedom from endoleaks was 95.4% at one month and 61.7% at 
one and three years. Freedom from reintervention was 85.8% at three years.
CONCLUSION: Elective EVAR in nonagenarians is associated with acceptable early 
and mid-term outcomes. Age by itself should not be considered an exclusion 
criterion for treatment.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the indicators affecting life expectancy at birth 
and life expectancy at age 65 by multiple regression analysis and principal 
component analysis, and examined the factors affecting the longevity.
METHODS: We set indicators for health status, risk factors, access to care, 
quality of care and health care resources. Then, we conducted multiple 
regression analysis with life expectancy at birth and life expectancy at age 65 
as the objective variables and 22 indicators as explanatory variables. Principal 
component analysis was also performed on the 22 indicators.
RESULTS: Men's life expectancy at birth was positively affected by hospital 
admission ratio and national health insurance costs, and negatively by the rate 
of requirement of care certification and alcohol consumption. Men's life 
expectancy at age 65 was positively affected by income-to-medical expenses ratio 
and hospitalization treatment ratio, and negatively by requiring care 
certification rate, smoking rate and obesity rate. Women's life expectancy at 
birth was positively affected by population coverage and hospitalization 
treatment ratio, and negatively by women's heart disease mortality rate, 
requiring care certification rate and smoking rate. Women's life expectancy at 
age 65 was positively affected by late-stage elderly medical costs and the 
number of doctors, and negatively by requiring care certification rate and air 
pollution. Principal component 1 indicated "aging high-medical-resource 
society", principal component 2 indicated "high mortality from heart disease", 
and principal component 3 indicated the "degree of risk factor".
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the indicators found to affect life expectancy at 
birth and life expectancy at age 65, it is necessary to take measures to ensure 
a long life.

Input-output analysis is one of the central methodological pillars of industrial 
ecology. However, the literature that discusses different structures of 
environmental extensions (EEs), that is, the scope of physical flows and their 
attribution to sectors in the monetary input-output table (MIOT), remains 
fragmented. This article investigates the conceptual and empirical implications 
of applying two different but frequently used designs of EEs, using the case of 
energy accounting, where one represents energy supply while the other energy use 
in the economy. We derive both extensions from an official energy supply-use 
dataset and apply them to the same single-region input-output (SRIO) model of 
Austria, thereby isolating the effect that stems from the decision for the 
extension design. We also crosscheck the SRIO results with energy footprints 
from the global multi-regional input-output (GMRIO) dataset EXIOBASE. Our 
results show that the ranking of footprints of final demand categories (e.g., 
household and export) is sensitive to the extension design and that 
product-level results can vary by several orders of magnitude. The GMRIO-based 
comparison further reveals that for a few countries the supply-extension result 
can be twice the size of the use-extension footprint (e.g., Australia and 
Norway). We propose a graph approach to provide a generalized framework to 
disclosing the design of EEs. We discuss the conceptual differences between the 
two extension designs by applying analogies to hybrid life-cycle assessment and 
conclude that our findings are relevant for monitoring of energy efficiency and 
emission reduction targets and corporate footprint accounting.

pathologies.

Herein we reviewed the computed tomography (CT) findings of a spectrum of 
pathological entities affecting the duodenum. We discuss the CT findings of some 
congenital, inflammatory, traumatic, and neoplastic pathologies of the duodenum 
along with the conventional barium studies of selected conditions. Pathologies 
of this C-shaped intestinal segment, derived from both foregut and midgut, are 
often overlooked in clinical practice and radiological literature. While 
congenital anomalies like duplication cysts and diverticula are usually 
asymptomatic, annular pancreas and malrotation may manifest in the first decade 
of life. Primary as well as secondary involvement of the duodenum by various 
disease processes can be evaluated by careful CT technique and proper attention 
to the duodenum. Among congenital conditions, annular pancreas, duplication 
cyst, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, midgut volvulus, and diverticula are 
presented. Duodenal involvement in adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, gastrointestinal 
stromal tumours, Crohn's disease, and groove pancreatitis are discussed. 
Duodenal wall haematoma and traumatic duodenal perforation causing 
pneumoretroperitoneum in two patients after blunt trauma of the abdomen are also 
illustrated. CT provides superb anatomic detail and offers high diagnostic 
specificity for the detection of duodenal pathologies because it allows direct 
imaging of the intestinal wall, secondary signs of bowel disease within the 
surrounding mesentery, and abnormal findings in adjacent structures. Primary 
duodenal malignancies and local extension from adjacent malignancies can be 
diagnosed by CT reliably. CT also plays a vital role in the diagnosis of 
traumatic duodenal injury by differentiating between mural haematoma and a 
duodenal perforation because the latter requires immediate surgical 
intervention.
