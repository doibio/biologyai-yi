reported to be effective for reducing death from exsanguination in trauma 
patients. We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid ER system 
in severe trauma patients without severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing the hybrid ER system to 
the conventional ER system from the perspective of the third-party healthcare 
payer in Japan. A short-term decision tree and a long-term Markov model using a 
lifetime time horizon were constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and associated lifetime healthcare costs. Short-term mortality and 
healthcare costs were derived from medical records and claims data in a tertiary 
care hospital with a hybrid ER. Long-term mortality and utilities were 
extrapolated from the literature. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at 
$47,619 per QALY gained and the discount rate was 2%. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The hybrid ER system was associated with a gain of 1.03 QALYs and an 
increment of $33,591 lifetime costs compared to the conventional ER system, 
resulting in an ICER of $32,522 per QALY gained. The ICER was lower than the 
willingness-to-pay threshold if the odds ratio of 28-day mortality was < 0.66. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the hybrid ER system was 
cost-effective with a 79.3% probability.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that the hybrid ER system is a likely 
cost-effective strategy for treating severe trauma patients without severe TBI.

BACKGROUND: Harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening include psychosocial 
consequences. We have not identified studies using a participant-relevant 
questionnaire with adequate measurement properties to investigate these harms. 
However, Brodersen et al. have previously developed a core questionnaire 
consequences of screening (COS) for use in screening for life-threatening 
diseases. Therefore, the objectives were: (1) To investigate content validity of 
COS in a CRC screening setting and in case of gaps in content coverage (2) 
generate new items and themes and (3) test the possibly extended version of COS 
for dimensionality and differential item functioning (DIF) using Rasch Models.
METHODS: We performed two-part-focus-groups with CRC screenees. Screenees were 
recruited by strategic sampling. In the first part 16 screenees with 
false-positive results (n = 7) and low-risk polyps (n = 9) were interviewed 
about their CRC screening experiences and in the second part COS was examined 
for content validity. When new information was developed in the focus groups, 
new items covering this topic were generated. Subsequently, new items were, 
together with COS, tested in the subsequent interviews. A random subsample 
(n = 410) from a longitudinal questionnaire study, not yet published, was used 
to form the data for this paper. We analysed multidimensionality and uniform DIF 
with Andersen's conditional likelihood ratio test. We assessed individual item 
fit to the model. We also analysed Local Dependence (LD) and DIF by partial 
gamma coefficients using Rasch Models.
RESULTS: COS was found relevant in a CRC screening setting. However, new 
information was discovered in the focus groups, covered by 18 new CRC 
screening-specific items. The Rasch analyses only revealed minor problems in the 
COS-scales. The 18 new items were distributed on four new CRC screening-specific 
dimensions and one single item.
CONCLUSION: An extended version of COS specifically for use in a CRC screening 
setting has been developed. The extended part encompasses four new scales and 
one new single item. The original COS with the CRC-screening specific extension 
is called consequences of screening in colorectal cancer (COS-CRC). COS-CRC 
possessed reliability, unidimensionality and invariant measurement.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have worse 
physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. 
In 2009, the European Psychiatric Association, the European Society of 
Cardiology and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes published a 
position paper aimed to improve cardiovascular and diabetes care in patients 
with severe mental illnesses. However, the initiative did not produce the 
expected results. Experts in SSD or in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
convened to identify main issues relevant to management of cardiometabolic risk 
factors in schizophrenia patients and to seek consensus through the Delphi 
method.
METHODS: The steering committee identified four topics: 1) cardiometabolic risk 
factors in schizophrenia patients; 2) cardiometabolic risk factors related to 
antipsychotic treatment; 3) differences in antipsychotic cardiometabolic 
profiles; 4) management of cardiometabolic risk. Twelve key statements were 
included in a Delphi questionnaire delivered to a panel of expert European 
psychiatrists.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached for all statements with positive agreement higher 
than 85% in the first round. European psychiatrists agreed on: 1) high 
cardiometabolic risk in patients with SSD, 2) importance of correct risk 
management of cardiometabolic diseases, from lifestyle modification to treatment 
of risk factors, including the choice of antipsychotic drugs with a favourable 
cardiometabolic profile. The expert panel identified the psychiatrist as the 
central coordinating figure of management, possibly assisted by other 
specialists and general practitioners.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates high level of agreement among European 
psychiatrists regarding the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and 
management in subjects with SSD.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the contribution of county-level contextual factors to 
differences in life expectancy in the United States.
METHODS: We used a counterfactual approach to estimate the years of life 
expectancy lost associated with 45 potentially modifiable county-level 
contextual characteristics in the United States in the year 2016. Contextual 
data and life expectancy data were obtained from the County Health Ranking 
Project and the U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, respectively.
RESULTS: Median census-tract-level life expectancy was 78.90 (interquartile 
range, 76.30-81.00) years, and the range across census tracts spanned 41.20 
years. Large variations in life expectancy existed within and between states and 
within and between counties; the gap between counties was 20.30 years and gaps 
within counties ranged from 0 to 34.60 years. An array of 45 county-level 
factors was associated with 4.30 years of life expectancy loss. County-level 
adult smoking, food insecurity, adult obesity, physical inactivity, college 
education, and median household income were associated with 1.24-, 0.89-, 0.58-, 
0.35-, 0.33-, and 0.14-year losses in life expectancy, respectively; and 
altogether were associated with a 3.53-year loss in life expectancy. The 
contribution of contextual factors to years of life expectancy lost varied among 
states and was more pronounced in states with lower life expectancy and in areas 
of increased socioeconomic deprivation and increased percentage of Black race.
CONCLUSION: Substantial geographic variation in life expectancy was observed. 
Six county-level contextual factors were associated with a 3.53-year loss in 
life expectancy. The findings may inform and help prioritize approaches to 
reduce inequalities in life expectancy in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) are now both used to treat aortic stenosis in patients in 
whom life expectancy may exceed valve durability. The choice of initial 
bioprosthesis should therefore consider the relative safety and efficacy of 
potential subsequent interventions.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare TAVR in failed transcatheter 
aortic valves (TAVs) versus surgical aortic valves (SAVs).
METHODS: Data were collected on 434 TAV-in-TAV and 624 TAV-in-SAV consecutive 
procedures performed at centers participating in the Redo-TAVR international 
registry. Propensity score matching was applied, and 330 matched (165:165) 
patients were analyzed. Principal endpoints were procedural success, procedural 
safety, and mortality at 30 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: For TAV-in-TAV versus TAV-in-SAV, procedural success was observed in 
120 (72.7%) versus 103 (62.4%) patients (p = 0.045), driven by a numerically 
lower frequency of residual high valve gradient (p = 0.095), ectopic valve 
deployment (p = 0.081), coronary obstruction (p = 0.091), and conversion to open 
heart surgery (p = 0.082). Procedural safety was achieved in 116 (70.3%) versus 
119 (72.1%) patients (p = 0.715). Mortality at 30 days was 5 (3%) after 
TAV-in-TAV and 7 (4.4%) after TAV-in-SAV (p = 0.570). At 1 year, mortality was 
12 (11.9%) and 10 (10.2%), respectively (p = 0.633). Aortic valve area was 
larger (1.55 ± 0.5 cm2 vs. 1.37 ± 0.5 cm2; p = 0.040), and the mean residual 
gradient was lower (12.6 ± 5.2 mm Hg vs. 14.9 ± 5.2 mm Hg; p = 0.011) after 
TAV-in-TAV. The rate of moderate or greater residual aortic regurgitation was 
similar, but mild aortic regurgitation was more frequent after TAV-in-TAV 
(p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In propensity score-matched cohorts of TAV-in-TAV versus TAV-in-SAV 
patients, TAV-in-TAV was associated with higher procedural success and similar 
procedural safety or mortality.

OBJECTIVE: The AMBUVASC trial evaluated the cost effectiveness of outpatient vs. 
inpatient hospitalisation for endovascular repair of lower extremity arterial 
disease (LEAD).
METHODS: AMBUVASC was a national multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled 
trial conducted in nine public and two private French centres. The primary 
endpoint was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined by cost 
per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Analysis was conducted from a societal 
perspective, excluding indirect costs, and considering a one month time horizon.
RESULTS: From 16 February 2016 to 29 May 2017, 160 patients were randomised (80 
per group). A modified intention to treat analysis was performed with 153 
patients (outpatient hospitalisation: n = 76; inpatient hospitalisation: 
n = 77). The patients mainly presented intermittent claudication (outpatient 
arm: 97%; inpatient arm: 92%). Rates of peri-operative complications were 20% 
(15 events) and 18% (14 events) for the outpatient and inpatient arms 
respectively (p = .81). Overall costs (difference: €187.83; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] -275.68-651.34) and QALYs (difference: 0.00277; 95% CI -0.00237 - 
0.00791) were higher for outpatients due to more re-admissions than the 
inpatient arm. The mean ICER was €67 741 per QALY gained for the base case 
analysis with missing data imputed using multiple imputation by predictive mean 
matching. The outpatient procedure was not cost effective for a willingness to 
pay of €50 000 per QALY and the probability of being cost effective was only 59% 
for a €100 000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: Outpatient hospitalisation is not cost effective compared with 
inpatient hospitalisation for endovascular repair of patients with claudication 
at a €50 000/QALY threshold.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated what kinds of experiences influence regional 
quota (chiikiwaku) medical students' motivation to practice community healthcare 
(CH), and the mechanism of this influence, by focusing on their experiences in a 
community-based medical education (CBME) programme.
DESIGN: A qualitative thematic analysis based on interviews.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from the chiikiwaku students of Kobe 
University, Japan, using purposive sampling.
PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen students participated. The median (IQR) age of 
participants was 23 (23-24); half were sixth-year and half fifth-year students.
ANALYSIS: From September to December 2018, the interviews were audiorecorded and 
transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed according to the 'Steps for Coding and 
Theorisation' method. Our theoretical framework comprised three internal motives 
(ie, needs, cognitions and emotions) and their subordinate motivation theories 
self-determination theory, expectancy-value theories, and positive and negative 
emotions, respectively.
RESULTS: Three mechanisms and corresponding experiences emerged. The first 
mechanism, envisioning and preparing for practising CH, included corresponding 
experiences-empathy for the community, grasping the demands for CH, 
understanding the practices of CH, finding a role model and diminishing the 
conflicts between personal life and career. The second mechanism, belonging to a 
supportive community, included the robust construction of students' CH community 
and harmonisation with community residents. The third mechanism, psychological 
effects included the affect heuristic and framing effect. Student experiences 
brought about the changes and influences described in the presented mechanisms, 
and had both positive and negative impacts on their motivation towards CH. These 
results can be interpreted through the multifaceted lenses of motivation 
theories.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors revealed that motivation mechanisms of medical students 
towards CH derived from positive interaction with community residents, 
healthcare professionals and other students, and from exposure to attractive 
community environments and cultures. These experiences should be incorporated 
into CBME programmes to further encourage positive attitudes towards CH.

BACKGROUND Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), also known as progeria, 
is due to a mutation in the LMNA gene, resulting in a life expectancy of no more 
than 13 years, and a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease. We 
report the case of a 13-year-old boy from Thailand with Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome with coronary artery and aortic calcification and 
non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). CASE REPORT A 
13-year-old Thai boy was diagnosed with progeria. His physical appearance 
included short stature and thin limbs with prominent joint stiffness. He had 
craniofacial disproportion, with the absence of earlobes and with micrognathia. 
His skin had a generalized scleroderma-like lesion and hair loss with prominent 
scalp veins. His mental and cognitive functions were normal. Unfortunately, the 
mutation status in the LMNA gene was not available for testing in Thailand. He 
was diagnosed as having NSTEMI based on clinical chest pain, 12-lead ECG, and 
elevated cardiac troponin level. The coronary calcium score reflected severe 
calcification of the aortic valve and coronary artery disease along the left 
main and left anterior descending arteries. The patient received treatment with 
medication and aggressive risk factor control. After 3 months of follow-up, the 
patient reported no recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This case of 
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is rare in that most patients do not live 
beyond 13 years of age. This patient presented with typical accelerated 
degenerative changes of the cardiovascular system, including NSTEMI.

Rotor syndrome is defined as a self-limiting hyperbilirubinemia characterized by 
jaundice that does not need treatment, cause any morbidity or affect life 
expectancy. As far as the literature is evaluated, the number of patients with 
Rotor syndrome diagnosed at the molecular level is less than 20 until today. In 
this case presentation, we aimed to present two siblings with Rotor syndrome who 
were diagnosed at the molecular level. To the nest of our knowledge, these 
patients are the first Turkish patients with Rotor syndrome diagnosed at the 
molecular level.

In this review, we describe the role of oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+) as a molecule central to health benefits as the result from 
observing selected healthy lifestyle recommendations. Namely, NAD+ level can be 
regulated by lifestyle and nutrition approaches such as fasting, caloric 
restriction, sports activity, low glucose availability, and heat shocks. NAD+ is 
reduced with age at a cellular, tissue, and organismal level due to 
inflammation, defect in NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis, and the PARP-mediated 
NAD+ depletion. This leads to a decrease in cellular energy production and DNA 
repair and modifies genomic signalling leading to an increased incidence of 
chronic diseases and ageing. By implementing healthy lifestyle approaches, 
endogenous intracellular NAD+ levels can be increased, which explains the 
molecular mechanisms underlying health benefits at the organismal level. Namely, 
adherence to here presented healthy lifestyle approaches is correlated with an 
extended life expectancy free of major chronic diseases.

Declining life expectancy and increasing all-cause mortality in the United 
States have been associated with unhealthy behaviors, socioecological factors, 
and preventable disease. A growing body of basic science, clinical research, and 
population health evidence points to the benefits of healthy behaviors, 
environments and policies to maintain health and prevent, treat, and reverse the 
root causes of common chronic diseases. Similarly, innovations in research 
methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and 
breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for 
producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these 
advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research 
Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4-5, 2019. The 
Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the 
six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical 
activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social 
connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge 
and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related 
disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying 
cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and 
computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate 
clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, 
federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans 
Administration have begun to adopt "whole-person health and performance" models 
that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease 
and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support 
leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational 
modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to 
improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of 
evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and 
develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and 
underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study. The 
COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts people with chronic diseases 
that are amenable to effective lifestyle medicine interventions, makes the 
Summit's findings and recommendations for future research particularly timely 
and relevant.

With the aging of the population and the extension of life expectancy, 
osteoporosis is becoming a global epidemic. Although there are several drugs 
used to treat osteoporosis in clinical practice, such as parathyroid hormone or 
bisphosphonates, they all have some serious side effects. Therefore, a safer 
drug is called for osteoporosis, especially for the prevention in the early 
stage of the disease, not only the treatment in the later stage. Panax 
notoginseng saponin (PNS), a traditional Chinese herb, has been used as 
anti-ischemic drug due to its function on improving vascular circulation. In 
order to verify whether Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) could be used to 
prevent osteoporosis, ovariectomy (OVX) was induced in female C57BL/C6J mice, 
followed by orally administration with 40 mg/kg/d, 80 mg/kg/d, and 160 mg/kg/d 
of three different dosages of PNS for 9 weeks. Serum biochemical analysis, 
micro-CT, histological evaluation, and immunostaining of markers of osteogenesis 
and angiogenesis were performed in the sham, osteoporotic (OVX), and treatment 
(OVX+PNS) groups. Micro-CT and histological evaluation showed that compared to 
sham group, the bone mass of OVX group reduced significantly, while it was 
significantly restored in the moderate-dose PNS (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) 
treatment groups. The expression of CD31 and osteocalcin (OCN) in the bone 
tissue of treatment group also increased, suggesting that PNS activated 
osteogenesis and angiogenesis, which subsequently increased the bone mass. These 
results confirmed the potential function of PNS on the prevention of 
osteoporosis. However, in the high dose of PNS (160 mg/kg) group, the 
antiosteoportic effect had been eliminated, which also suggested the importance 
of proper dose of PNS for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women.

Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome: Updates and Review of Current Therapy.

While most patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) follow an indolent 
course, patients with advanced-stage MF/Sézary syndrome (SS) have a poor 
prognosis with a median survival of less than 5 years. Although there are a 
number of treatments currently available, achieving and maintaining a durable 
response remain challenging, especially in advanced-stage MF/SS. The choice of 
frontline therapy is dependent on the stage of disease. For early-stage MF, the 
treatment concept is to control skin lesions mainly by skin-directed therapies, 
such as topical therapies, phototherapies, and radiotherapies. For 
advanced-stage MF/SS, systemic treatments by biological or targeted therapies 
including bexarotene and interferon either alone or in combination are tried 
first, with more immunosuppressive chemotherapies being reserved for refractory 
or rapidly progressive disease. Recent improvements in biological or targeted 
therapies include brentuximab vedotin and mogamulizumab. When biopsy samples 
have 10% or more CD30-positive malignant cells, brentuximab vedotin, an 
anti-CD30 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristin E, can be a desirable 
treatment option. For cases with blood involvement, mogamulizumab, an antibody 
binding to C-C chemokine receptor 4, is effective with high response rates. In 
the refractory setting, alemtuzumab, histone deacetylase inhibitors, 
pralatrexate, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin are considered as the treatment 
option. Because only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can 
offer a chance of cure with durable complete remission, advanced-stage patients 
with a markedly short life expectancy should be evaluated for eligibility. Given 
that there are few randomized controlled studies in the literature, it is 
necessary to investigate which therapy is preferable for each patient with MF/SS 
by comparative prospective trials.

Plant movements are generally slow, but some plant species have evolved the 
ability to move very rapidly at speeds comparable to those of animals. Whereas 
movement in animals relies on the contraction machinery of muscles, many plant 
movements use turgor pressure as the primary driving force together with 
secondarily generated elastic forces. The movement of stomata is the 
best-characterized model system for studying turgor-driven movement, and many 
gene products responsible for this movement, especially those related to ion 
transport, have been identified. Similar gene products were recently shown to 
function in the daily sleep movements of pulvini, the motor organs for 
macroscopic leaf movements. However, it is difficult to explain the mechanisms 
behind rapid multicellular movements as a simple extension of the mechanisms 
used for unicellular or slow movements. For example, water transport through 
plant tissues imposes a limit on the speed of plant movements, which becomes 
more severe as the size of the moving part increases. Rapidly moving traps in 
carnivorous plants overcome this limitation with the aid of the mechanical 
behaviors of their three-dimensional structures. In addition to a mechanism for 
rapid deformation, rapid multicellular movements also require a molecular system 
for rapid cell-cell communication, along with a mechanosensing system that 
initiates the response. Electrical activities similar to animal action 
potentials are found in many plant species, representing promising candidates 
for the rapid cell-cell signaling behind rapid movements, but the molecular 
entities of these electrical signals remain obscure. Here we review the current 
understanding of rapid plant movements with the aim of encouraging further 
biological studies into this fascinating, challenging topic.

BACKGROUND: After successful Helicobacter pylori eradication, patients with 
gastric mucosal atrophy are at high risk of gastric cancer. Endoscopy can detect 
early gastric cancer with high sensitivity.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of annual endoscopy 
versus biennial endoscopy versus no screening for gastric cancer screening in 
patients after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication.
METHODS: We developed decision trees with Markov models for a hypothetical 
cohort of patients aged 50 years after successful Helicobacter pylori 
eradication over a lifetime horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Main 
outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life expectancy 
life-years (LYs) with discounting at a fixed annual rate of 3%, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, biennial endoscopy (US$4305, 19.785QALYs, 
19.938LYs) was more cost-effective than annual endoscopy (US$7516, 19.808QALYs, 
19.958LYs, ICER; US$135,566/QALY gained) and no screening (US$14,326, 
19.704QALYs, 19.873LYs). In scenario analyses, biennial endoscopy for patients 
with mild-to-moderate gastric mucosal atrophy and annual endoscopy for patients 
with severe gastric mucosal atrophy were the most cost-effective. 
Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to incidence of gastric cancer and the 
proportion of stage I. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo 
simulation demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay level of US$100,000/QALY 
gained, biennial endoscopy was optimal 99.9% for patients with mild-to-moderate 
gastric mucosal atrophy, and that annual endoscopy was optimal 98.4% for 
patients with severe gastric mucosal atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on cancer risk assessment of gastric mucosal atrophy and 
cost-effectiveness results, annual or biennial endoscopic surveillance could be 
established for patients after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication.
