SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adults with SB (median age, 32.7 years; 
interquartile range, 22.6 to 39.0) who had undergone dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry imaging at a single tertiary hospital from 2004 to 2015.
RESULTS: The mean body mass index was 31.7 ± 7.5 kg/m2; 26 (53.1%) were obese. 
Using age- and sex-matched fat percentiles from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey III, 62.5% had a total body percentage fat greater 
than the 95th percentile. Low bone mass (defined as a Z-score of ≤-2.0) was 
present in 21.9% at the L1 vertebra and in 35.1% at the femoral neck. Ten 
(20.4%) had a history of MTFs. A BMD or Z-score at L1, femoral neck, or total 
body site did not correlate with the occurrence of MTF. Fat mass was 
significantly and positively associated with BMD after adjustment for age, sex, 
and height and accounted for 18.6% of the variance in BMD (P = 0.005). The 
prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension (20.4%) and 
obstructive sleep apnea (16.3%), was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and low BMD are common in young adults with SB. An 
increased fat mass correlated significantly with BMD. The prevalence of 
metabolic complications in patients with SB is increased and deserves further 
study.

CONTEXT: Severe obesity is one of the major features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome 
(BBS) and causes reduced life expectancy. Bariatric surgery is an effective 
treatment of morbid obesity. Data on the effect of bariatric surgery for 
monogenic obesity is essentially lacking. We present the clinical and metabolic 
3-year follow-up of sleeve gastrectomy in a BBS patient.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old obese woman with BBS (body mass index, 40 kg/m2) 
was referred to our clinic for uncontrolled diabetes, dyslipidemia, 
hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). After sleeve 
gastrectomy, progressive weight loss was observed, with a 32% total weight loss 
at 3-year follow-up. Glycemic control and NAFLD improved significantly. Blood 
pressure normalized, and treatment was discontinued 3 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be a safe and effective 
treatment of morbid BBS-related obesity in adult patients. Significant and 
sustained weight loss leads to the improvement of several obesity-related 
comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and NAFLD, as in polygenic 
obesity. Further data are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of 
bariatric surgery in BBS.

PURPOSE: Summarizing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on a quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) scale is an essential component to any economic evaluation comparing 
alternative medical treatments. While multiple studies have compared PRO items 
and instruments based on their psychometric properties, no study has compared 
the preference-based summary of the EQ-5D-3L and Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) instruments. As part of this 
comparison, a major aim of this manuscript is to transform PROMIS-29 utility 
values to an EQ-5D-3L scale.
METHODS: A nationally representative survey of 2623 US adults completed the 
29-item PROMIS health profile instrument (PROMIS-29) and the 3-level version of 
the EQ-5D instrument (EQ-5D-3L). Their responses were summarized on a health 
utility scale using published estimates. Using regression analysis, PROMIS-29 
and EQ-5D-3L utility weights were compared with each other as well as with 
self-reported general health.
RESULTS: PROMIS-29 utility weights were much lower than the EQ-5D-3L weights. 
However, a correlation coefficient of 0.769 between the utility values of the 
two instruments suggests that the main discordance is simply a difference in 
scale between the measures. It is also possible to map PROMIS-29 utility weights 
onto an EQ-5D-3L scale. EQ-5D-3L losses equal .1784 × (PROMIS-29 Losses).7286.
CONCLUSIONS: The published estimates of the PROMIS-29 produce lower utility 
values than many other health instruments. Mapping the PROMIS-29 estimates to an 
EQ-5D-3L scale alleviates this issue and allows for a more straightforward 
comparison between the PROMIS-29 and other common health instruments.

ОBJECTIVE: The development and use of population models of mental health in the 
Russian population to analyze the relationship between indicators of mental 
disorders, psychiatric care resources taking into account medical/demographic 
and socio-economic factors in the period of 1992-2015.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sources of information were: 1) the data of the 
Russian medical statistics on the main indicators of mental health of the 
Russian population and psychiatric care resources; 2) government statistics on 
the demographic and socio-economic situation of the population of Russia during 
this period. The study used system data analysis, correlation and regression 
analyses.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Linear and nonlinear models with a high level of 
significance were obtained to assess the impact of socio-economic, health and 
demographic (population, life expectancy, migration, mortality) factors and 
resources of the service (primarily, manpower) on the dynamics of the main 
indicators (prevalence, incidence) of mental health of the population. In recent 
years, a decline in the prevalence and incidence of the Russian population is a 
consequence of the scarcity of mental health services, in particular, personnel 
resources.

Estimation of the Leukemia Risk in Human Populations Exposed to Benzene from 
Tobacco Smoke Using Epidemiological Data.

Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between 
occupational benzene exposure and increased leukemia risk, in particular acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML). However, there is still uncertainty as to the risk to 
the general population from exposure to lower environmental levels of benzene. 
To estimate the excess risk of leukemia from low-dose benzene exposure, various 
methods for incorporating epidemiological data in quantitative risk assessment 
were utilized. Tobacco smoke was identified as one of the main potential sources 
of benzene exposure and was the focus of this exposure assessment, allowing 
further investigation of the role of benzene in smoking-induced leukemia. 
Potency estimates for benzene were generated from individual occupational 
studies and meta-analysis data, and an exposure assessment for two smoking 
subgroups (light and heavy smokers) carried out. Subsequently, various 
techniques, including life-table analysis, were then used to evaluate both the 
excess lifetime risk and the contribution of benzene to smoking-induced leukemia 
and AML. The excess lifetime risk for smokers was estimated at between two and 
six additional leukemia deaths in 10,000 and one to three additional AML deaths 
in 10,000. The contribution of benzene to smoking-induced leukemia was estimated 
at between 9% and 24% (Upper CL 14-31%). For AML this contribution was estimated 
as 11-30% (Upper CL 22-60%). From the assessments carried out here, it appears 
there is an increased risk of leukemia from low-level exposure to benzene and 
that benzene may contribute up to a third of smoking-induced leukemia. 
Comparable results from using methods with varying degrees of complexity were 
generated.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiological and economic impact of a nine-valent 
(nonavalent) human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine 
programme for young teenagers in Singapore.
DESIGN: Mathematical modelling.
SETTING: Pharmaco-economic simulation projection.
POPULATION: Singapore demography.
METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological and financial data from Singapore were used 
in a validated HPV transmission dynamic mathematical model to analyse the impact 
of nonavalent HPV vaccination over quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines in a 
school-based 2-dose vaccination for 11- to 12-year-old girls in the country. The 
model assumed routine cytology screening in the current rate (50%) and vaccine 
coverage rate of 80%.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes over a 100-year time period in the incidence and 
mortality rates of cervical cancer, case load of genital warts, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Compared with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccination programmes, 
nonavalent HPV universal vaccination resulted in an additional reduction of 
HPV31/33/45/52/58 related CIN1 of 40.5%, CIN 2/3 of 35.4%, cervical cancer of 
23.5%, and cervical cancer mortality of 20.2%. Compared with bivalent HPV 
vaccination, there was an additional reduction in HPV-6/11 related CIN1 of 
75.7%, and genital warts of 78.9% in women and 73.4% in men. Over the 100 years, 
after applying a discount of 3%, disease management cost will be reduced by 
32.5% (versus bivalent) and 7.5% (versus quadrivalent). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year gained was SGD 
929 compared with bivalent vaccination and SGD 9864 compared with quadrivalent 
vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Universal two-dose nonavalent HPV vaccination for 11- to 12-year-old 
adolescent women is very cost-effective in Singapore.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Nonavalent HPV vaccination of 11- to 12-year-old girls is 
cost-effective in Singapore.

Global health inequalities and the need for solidarity: a view from the Global 
South.

Tosam MJ, Chi PC, Munung NS, Oukem-Boyer OOM, Tangwa GB.

Although the world has experienced remarkable progress in health care since the 
last half of the 20th century, global health inequalities still persist. In some 
poor countries life expectancy is between 37-40 years lower than in rich 
countries; furthermore, maternal and infant mortality is high and there is lack 
of access to basic preventive and life-saving medicines, as well a high 
prevalence of neglected diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Moreover, 
globalization has made the world more connected than before such that health 
challenges today are no longer limited within national or regional boundaries, 
making all persons equally vulnerable. Because of this, diseases in the most 
affluent countries are closely connected with diseases in the poorest countries. 
In this paper, we argue that, because of global health inequalities, in a 
situation of equal vulnerability, there is need for global solidarity not only 
as a means of reducing health inequalities, but also as a way of putting up a 
united force against global health challenges. We argue for an African approach 
to solidarity in which the humanity of a person is not determined by his/her 
being human or rational capacity, but by his/her capacity to live a virtuous 
life. According to this view of solidarity, because no one is self-sufficient, 
no individual can survive alone. If we are to collectively flourish in a world 
where no individual, nation or region has all the health resources or protection 
needed for survival, we must engage in solidarity where we remain compassionate 
and available to one another at all times.

AIM: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) not only threatens a patient's life 
expectancy but also burdens the family and society with medical expenses. The 
mortality and prevalence rates are extremely high in Taiwan. Thus, this 
articleinvestigated the effectiveness of an innovative self-management program 
on the physiology, psychology, and management of patients with pre-ESRD.
METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, controlled trial and was set 
in the department of nephrology in a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan. In 
total, 112 patients with pre-ESRD were assigned randomly to either an 
experimental (n = 67) or a control (n = 45) group. The baseline data collection 
included physiological indicators, psychological factors (depression, anxiety), 
and measures of self-efficacy and self-management. Routine hospital care was 
provided for the control group after the pretest and an innovative 
self-management intervention was used in the experimental group for 4 weeks 
after the pretest. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated 3 months 
later.
RESULTS: Improvements in the physiological indicators, such as blood urea 
nitrogen and creatinine, and the psychological indicators, such as depression, 
self-efficacy, and self-management, reached statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: The innovative self-management program effectively decreased 
patients' functional indicators (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) and level of 
depression and enhanced their self-efficacy and self-management.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficiency levels of health expenditure in 25 
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methodology of stochastic frontier analysis was 
applied to estimate the efficiency scores of the countries, using data from 
years 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2012. Two output variables were considered, life 
expectancy at birth and infant mortality. In the latter case, determinants of 
inefficiency were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average efficiency level of the region using life expectancy is 
higher than when using infant mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that countries can still improve the use of 
resources. Guiding the expenditure policy towards immunization programs and 
ensuring births take place in the presence of trained staff are efficient ways 
to save neonates.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Comparar los niveles de eficiencia del gasto sanitario para 
25 países de América Latina y el Caribe.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Aplicando la metodología del análisis de frontera 
estocástica se estiman los índices de eficiencia de los países, utilizando datos 
de los años 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 y 2012. Se consideran dos variables 
alternativas de resultado de salud, la esperanza de vida y la mortalidad 
infantil. Para este último caso, se analizan los determinantes de la 
ineficiencia.
RESULTADOS: La media del nivel de eficiencia de la región considerando la 
esperanza de vida es mayor que al utilizar la mortalidad infantil.
CONCLUSIONES: Los resultados sugieren que los países aún pueden mejorar el uso 
de los recursos y que orientar una política de gasto hacia programas de 
inmunización y que garantice que los partos sean atendidos por un personal 
capacitado es una manera eficiente de salvar la vida de los neonatos.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) has been linked to maladaptive plasticity 
in the brain, which may contribute to chronic pain. Neuromodulatory approaches, 
such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Peripheral Electrical 
Stimulation (PES), have been used therapeutically to counteract brain 
maladaptive plasticity. However, it is currently unclear whether these 
neuromodulatory techniques enhance the benefits of exercise when administered 
together. Therefore, this protocol aims to investigate whether the addition of 
tDCS combined or not with PES enhances the effects of a land-based strengthening 
exercise program in patients with knee OA.
METHODS: Patients with knee OA (n = 80) will undertake a structured exercise 
program for five consecutive days. In addition, they will be randomized into 
four subgroups receiving either active anodal tDCS and sham PES (group 1; n = 
20), sham tDCS and active PES (group 2, n = 20), sham tDCS and PES (group 3, n = 
20), or active tDCS and PES (group 4, n = 20) for 20 min/day for five 
consecutive days just prior to commencement of the exercise program. The primary 
outcomes will be subjective pain intensity (VAS) and related function (WOMAC). 
Secondary outcomes will include quality of life (SF-36), anxiety and depression 
symptoms (HAD), self-perception of improvement, pressure pain thresholds over 
the knee, quadriceps strength, and quadriceps electromyographic activity during 
maximum knee extension voluntary contraction. We will also investigate cortical 
excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Outcome measures will be 
assessed at baseline, 1 month after, before any intervention, after 5 days of 
intervention, and at 1 month post exercise intervention.
DISCUSSION: The motor cortex becomes less responsive in knee OA because of 
poorly adapted plastic changes, which can impede exercise therapy benefits. 
Adding tDCS and/or PES may help to counteract those maladaptive plastic changes 
and improve the benefits of exercises, and the combination of both 
neuromodulatory techniques must have a higher magnitude of effect.

BACKGROUND: Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of 
rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, 
operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of 
operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is 
critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative 
surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or 
morbidity.
METHODS: The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading 
of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three 
systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on 
evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after 
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best 
available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of 
focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient 
with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) 
postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic 
considerations.
RESULTS: Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients 
throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior 
recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New 
guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including 
recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA 
of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred 
method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained 
through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality 
collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk 
score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm 
repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a 
documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less 
and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective 
open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% 
or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each 
year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead 
to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a 
door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 
minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We 
recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks 
with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II 
endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis 
is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental 
procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of 
teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not 
recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or 
genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless 
the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. 
Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative 
surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.
CONCLUSIONS: Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients 
with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the 
treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of 
new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing 
elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would 
benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in 
diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

DNA methylation is currently the most promising molecular marker for monitoring 
aging and predicting life expectancy. However, the mechanisms underlying 
age-related DNA methylation changes remain mostly undiscovered. Here we discuss 
the current knowledge of the dynamic nature of DNA epigenome landscape in 
mammals, and propose putative molecular mechanisms for aging-associated DNA 
epigenetic changes. Specifically, we describe age-related variations of 
methylcytosine and its oxidative derivatives in relation to the dynamics of 
chromatin structure, histone post-translational modifications and their 
modulators. Finally, we are proposing a conceptual framework that could explain 
the complex nature of the effects of age on DNA methylation patterns. This 
combines the accumulation of DNA methylation noise and also all of the 
predictable, site-specific DNA methylation changes. Gathering information in 
this area would pave the way for future investigation aimed at establishing a 
possible causative role of epigenetic mechanisms in aging.

Pulmonary fibrosis includes several lung disorders characterized by scar 
formation and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a particularly severe form 
of pulmonary fibrosis of unknown etiology with a mean life expectancy of 3years' 
post-diagnosis. Treatments for IPF are limited to two FDA approved drugs, 
pirfenidone and nintedanib. Most lead candidate drugs that are identified in 
pre-clinical animal studies fail in human clinical trials. Thus, there is a need 
for advanced humanized in vitro models of the lung to improve candidate 
treatments prior to moving to human clinical trials. The development of 3D 
tissue models has created systems capable of emulating human lung structure, 
function, and cell and matrix interactions. The specific models accomplish these 
features and preliminary studies conducted using some of these systems have 
shown potential for in vitro anti-fibrotic drug testing. Further 
characterization and improvements will enable these tissue models to extend 
their utility for in vitro drug testing, to help identify signaling pathways and 
mechanisms for new drug targets, and potentially reduce animal models as 
standard pre-clinical models of study. In the current review, we contrast 
different in vitro models based on increasing dimensionality (2D, 2.5D and 3D), 
with added focus on contemporary 3D pulmonary models of fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) 
represents a major public health issue and is associated with considerable 
morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
sacubitril/valsartan (formerly LCZ696) compared with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) 
(enalapril) in the treatment of HF-REF from the perspective of healthcare 
providers in the UK, Denmark and Colombia.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed based on data from a 
multinational, Phase III randomised controlled trial. A decision-analytic model 
was developed based on a series of regression models, which extrapolated 
health-related quality of life, hospitalisation rates and survival over a 
lifetime horizon. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: In the UK, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for 
sacubitril/valsartan (using cardiovascular mortality) was £17 100 (€20 400) 
versus enalapril. In Denmark, the ICER for sacubitril/valsartan was Kr 174 000 
(€22 600). In Colombia, the ICER was COP$39.5 million (€11 200) per QALY gained. 
Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to 
the extrapolation of mortality, duration of treatment effect and time horizon, 
but were robust to other structural changes, with most scenarios associated with 
ICERs below the willingness-to-pay threshold for all three country settings. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested the probability that 
sacubitril/valsartan was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay 
thresholds was 68%-94% in the UK, 84% in Denmark and 95% in Colombia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that, in all three countries, 
sacubitril/valsartan is likely to be cost-effective compared with an ACEI (the 
current standard of care) in patients with HF-REF.

Extension of the serum half-life is an important issue in developing new 
therapeutic proteins and expanding applications of existing therapeutic 
proteins. Conjugation of fatty acid, a natural human serum albumin ligand, to a 
therapeutic protein/peptide was developed as a technique to extend the serum 
half-life in vivo by taking advantages of unusually long serum half-life of 
human serum albumin (HSA). However, for broad applications of fatty 
acid-conjugation, several issues should be addressed, including a poor 
solubility of fatty acid and a substantial loss in the therapeutic activity. 
Therefore, herein we systematically investigate the conditions and components in 
conjugation of fatty acid to a therapeutic protein resulting in the HSA binding 
capacity without compromising therapeutic activities. By examining the crystal 
structure and performing dye conjugation assay, two sites (W160 and D112) of 
urate oxidase (Uox), a model therapeutic protein, were selected as sites for 
fatty acid-conjugation. Combination of site-specific incorporation of a 
clickable p-azido-L-phenylalanine to Uox and strain-promoted azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition allowed the conjugation of fatty acid (palmitic acid analog) to 
Uox with the HSA binding capacity and retained enzyme activity. Deoxycholic 
acid, a strong detergent, greatly enhanced the conjugation yield likely due to 
the enhanced solubility of palmitic acid analog.

BACKGROUND: The global phenomenon of population ageing is creating new 
challenges in both high and middle income countries, as functional limitations 
are expected to increase with age. The attribution method has been proposed to 
identify which conditions contribute most to disability using cross-sectional 
data. Although the original method was based on binary outcomes, we recently 
proposed an extension to multinomial responses, since different disability 
levels are often investigated in surveys. This is the first application of the 
extended method to evaluate differences in the contribution of chronic 
conditions to functional limitations in the older population of Brazil and 
Belgium.
METHODS: Representative data from individuals aged ≥65 years who participated in 
the 2008 or 2013 Health Interview Surveys in Belgium (N = 4521) or in the 2008 
National Household Sample Survey in Brazil (N = 28,437) were analysed. 
Individuals were classified as without, moderate or severe functional 
limitations, based on three activities of daily living: eating, showering, and 
toileting. Six chronic conditions common to the surveys - diabetes, heart 
diseases, musculoskeletal conditions, depression, chronic respiratory diseases, 
and cancer - were included in the analysis. Separate multinomial additive 
hazards models by gender for each country were fitted.
RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate functional limitations was larger in men in 
Brazil (8.4%) compared to Belgium (6.0%) and similar in women (approximately 
12.0%). Conversely, the severe prevalence in men was similar in the two 
countries (around 8.0%) and higher in women from Belgium (16.6%) than from 
Brazil (9.1%). Musculoskeletal conditions were the main contributors to the 
prevalence of functional limitations in men and women in Belgium but only in men 
and women with moderate functional limitations in Brazil. Depression and heart 
diseases contributed most to the severe prevalence of functional limitations in 
men and women in Brazil, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a better understanding of differences in the 
prevalence of different levels of functional limitations in Brazil and Belgium. 
These differences can be related to differences in socioeconomic conditions, 
health care access and quality, disease diagnosis, stage of epidemiology 
transition, life expectancy, and the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors in the 
two countries.

BACKGROUND: A major, life-limiting feature of Marfan syndrome (MFS) is the 
presence of aneurysmal disease. Cardiovascular intervention has dramatically 
improved the life expectancy of Marfan patients. Traditionally, the management 
of aortic root disease has been undertaken with composite-valve graft replacing 
the aortic valve and proximal aorta; more recently, valve sparing procedures 
have been developed to avoid the need for anticoagulation. This meta-analysis 
assesses the important surgical outcomes of the two surgical techniques.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies reporting the 
outcomes of aortic root surgery in Marfan patients with data extracted for 
outcomes of early and late mortality, thromboembolic events, late bleeding 
complications and surgical reintervention rates.
RESULTS: The outcomes of 2,976 Marfan patients undergoing aortic root surgery 
were analysed, 1,624 patients were treated with composite valve graft (CVG) and 
1,352 patients were treated with valve sparing root replacement (VSRR). When 
compared against CVG, VSRR was associated with reduced risk of thromboembolism 
(OR =0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.62, P=0.0008), late hemorrhagic complications (OR 
=0.18; 95% CI, 0.07-0.45; P=0.0003) and endocarditis (OR =0.27; 95% CI, 
0.10-0.68; P=0.006). Importantly there was no significant difference in 
reintervention rates between VSRR and CVG (OR =0.89; 95% CI, 0.35-2.24; P=0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing body of evidence that VSRR can be reliably 
performed in Marfan patients, resulting in a durable repair with no increased 
risk of re-operation compared to CVG, thus avoiding the need for systemic 
anticoagulation in selected patients.

Etiology and pathogenesis of the Marfan syndrome: current understanding.

University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Much has changed regarding Marfan syndrome (MFS) over the past few decades. Once 
described solely as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, MFS is now one of 
a number of conditions recognized to be a disorder of abnormal signalling in the 
TGF-β pathway. The cardinal features of MFS, once encompassed by the ocular, 
skeletal and cardiovascular systems, are now known to encompass many more organ 
systems, especially as people with MFS grow older. They are growing older by 
several decades compared to the 1970's because of profound improvements in 
diagnosis and management of the cardiovascular features, especially dilatation 
of the aortic root. This dilatation can be detected first in infancy and 
followed up by echocardiography. Progressive enlargement increases the risk of 
type A dissection and aortic regurgitation, the major causes of early mortality, 
in untreated patients today. Medical therapy with β-adrenergic blockade, first 
shown to be effective in the 1980's, can retard this dilatation. In the past 
decade, angiotensin receptor blockade, which reduces aberrant signalling through 
one of the TGF-β pathways, also can be effective. However, when dilatation of 
the root becomes such that the risk of dissection increases to an unacceptable 
degree, surgical therapy becomes necessary. In the mid-1970's, the composite 
graft, introduced by Hugh Bentall, markedly reduced mortality. In the past 
decade, a valve-spring aortic root replacement, advanced by Tirone David, has 
become widely adopted. Mid-term results are quite encouraging. Other 
cardiovascular involvement, such as mitral valve prolapse, type B dissection, 
and dilatation and dissection of aortic branches, also require close monitoring. 
Currently, life-expectancy in people with MFS who are diagnosed early and 
treated prophylactically is approaching that of the general population.

Physical Therapy for Neurological Conditions in Geriatric Populations.

Carmeli E(1).

(1)Department of Physical Therapy, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.

With more of the world's population surviving longer, individuals often face 
age-related neurology disorders and decline of function that can affect 
lifestyle and well-being. Despite neurophysiological changes affecting the brain 
function and structure, the aged brain, in some degree, can learn and relearn 
due to neuroplasticity. Recent advances in rehabilitation techniques have 
produced better functional outcomes in age-related neurological conditions. 
Physical therapy (PT) of the elderly individual focuses in particular on 
sensory-motor impairments, postural control coordination, and prevention of 
sarcopenia. Geriatric PT has a significant influence on quality of life, 
independent living, and life expectancy. However, in many developed and 
developing countries, the profession of PT is underfunded and understaffed. This 
article provides a brief overview on (a) age-related disease of central nervous 
system and (b) the principles, approaches, and doctrines of motor skill learning 
and point out the most common treatment models that PTs use for neurological 
patients.
