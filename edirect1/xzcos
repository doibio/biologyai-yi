BACKGROUND: Research indicates that the age of onset of first acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) is an essential element in the life expectancy that has been 
decreasing in developing countries. There are various studies performed in Iran 
reporting a range of ages at time of AMI. Thus, this meta-analysis study is 
designed to determine the mean age at first AMI in the Iranian population.
METHODS: All studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed 
using standard keywords in the databases from 2000 to 2016. Two raters verified 
a total of 658 articles. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria of this 
study for meta-analysis. Cochran test and I-squared (I2) were used for samples' 
homogeneity. Pooled estimates of mean were calculated using the random effects 
inverse-variance model.
RESULTS: The mean age of AMI varied between 55.9 to 62.9 years among the primary 
studies. The pooled mean age of first AMI with a 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for the total sample, men, and women were 59 (58.9, 60.4), 58.7 (58.3, 59.2), 
and 64.2 (63.5, 64.8), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis shows that the mean age of first onset of AMI in 
Iranian people is slightly lower than that reported elsewhere; and it is lower 
for men than for women.

BACKGROUND: With the advancement of antiretroviral therapy and improved life 
expectancy, women living with HIV/AIDS are enjoying a better sexual life. Yet, 
the consistent utilization of contraceptive in such patients is highly 
recommended. There is paucity of data regarding contraceptive use among 
HIV-positive and negative women in Ethiopia. The present study aimed at 
examining the use of contraceptives among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-positive 
and HIV-negative women attending family planning Clinic of Gondar university 
referral hospital between January 2016 and August 2017. Descriptive statistics 
were used to present categorical data and Pearson's chi-square test was done to 
examine differences in the utilization of contraceptives between HIV-positive 
and HIV-negative women. Kaplan Meier test was also carried out to determine the 
incidence of unintended pregnancy. A p-value of 0.05 was deemed significant with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 894 participants consisting of 314 HIV-positive and 580 
HIV-negative women were included in the study. The rate of previous unintended 
pregnancy was 280 (31.3%) in HIV-negative women and 115 (12.9%) in HIV-infected 
women. Women who routinely utilized contraceptives were more likely to avoid 
unintended pregnancy [log rank: 2.89, p < 0.05]. Unlike HIV-negative women 
(2.9%), HIV-positive (28.4%) women reported a higher rate of intrauterine device 
use. Male condom was used more commonly in HIV-infected women (26.7%) as 
compared to HIV negative (3.9%) women (p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine contraceptive device was reported to be the most 
commonly used contraceptive method in HIV patients. Further, unintended 
pregnancy was relatively common in women with low contraceptive practice. The 
use of dual contraceptives should be advocated for HIV-positive women so as to 
protect unintended pregnancy and curtail the transmission of HIV.

In view of the continuing increase in life expectancy, the question arises as to 
the state of health in which these years of gained life can be spent. The 
research findings on social differences in health and life expectancy suggest 
that this question has to be answered differently for different population 
groups. Even after the age of 65, persons with a low socioeconomic status are 
more likely to be affected by chronic illnesses and complaints, functional 
limitations of everyday activities, as well as impairments of well-being and 
health-related quality of life. With a significant proportion of people with low 
socioeconomic status still dying prematurely, the increase in lifetime that is 
observed for all population groups could increase the social gap in health in 
later life. This implies the challenge of giving special attention to the needs 
of socially disadvantaged groups in policies and programs aiming to improve the 
health of older people and preventing the need for care.

PURPOSE: To systematically assess patterns and temporal changes in the 
measurement and valuation of childhood health utilities and associations between 
methodological factors.
METHODS: Studies reporting childhood health utilities using direct or indirect 
valuation methods, published by June 2017, were identified through PubMed, 
Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EconLit, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PEDE. 
The following were explored: patterns in tariff application; linear trends in 
numbers of studies/samples and paediatric cost-utility analyses (CUAs) and 
associations between them; changes in proportions of studies/samples within 
characteristic-based categories over pre-specified periods; impact of National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on primary UK research 
and associations between valuation method, age and methodological factors.
RESULTS: 335 studies with 3974 samples covering all ICD-10 chapters, 23 
valuation methods, 12 respondent types and 42 countries were identified by 
systematic review. 34.0% of samples using indirect methods compatible with 
childhood applied childhood-derived tariffs. There was no association between 
numbers of studies/samples and numbers of CUAs. Compared to 1990-2008, 2009-June 
2017 saw a significant fall in the proportion of studies using case series; 
significant compositional changes across ICD-10 chapters and significantly 
higher sample proportions using childhood-specific and adult-specific indirect 
valuation methods, and based on pre-adolescents, self-assessment, 
self-administration and experienced health states. NICE guidance was weakly 
effective in promoting reference methods. Associations between valuation method, 
age and methodological factors were significant.
CONCLUSION: 1990-2017 witnessed significant changes in primary research on 
childhood health utilities. Health technology assessment agencies should note 
the equivocal effect of methodological guidance on primary research.

INTRODUCTION: US adults with serious mental illness (SMI), compared to those 
without SMI, have a higher prevalence of smoking, which contributes to a shorter 
life expectancy. This study compared current smoking and quitting-related 
characteristics of low-income US adults with and without SMI who received 
healthcare at federally funded health centers.
METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from adults ≥ 18 years old in the nationally 
representative 2014 Health Center Patient Survey (n = 5592), we compared the 
prevalence of ever and current smoking among adults with and without SMI and 
calculated quit ratios as the percentage of ever smokers who have quit smoking. 
We examined the association between SMI and receiving advice to quit, making 
quit attempts, and having plans to quit in the next 30 days using multivariable 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 1376 (23%) of participants had SMI. Ever smoking prevalence 
was 68% in adults with SMI and 41% in adults without SMI, and current smoking 
prevalence was 48% and 22%, respectively. The quit ratio was 30% and 46% among 
participants with and without SMI, respectively. Compared to smokers without 
SMI, more smokers with SMI reported receiving advice to quit in the past 
12 months (aOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.20-5.07). Smokers with and without SMI did not 
differ significantly in their odds of having made a past-12-month quit attempt 
or plans to quit.
CONCLUSIONS: Smokers with SMI seen in federally funded health centers were just 
as likely to have made a quit attempt and to have plans to quit as smokers 
without SMI. Despite a higher likelihood of receiving clinician advice to quit, 
the lower quit ratio in this population suggests that advice alone is unlikely 
to be sufficient. These results underscore the need for augmented strategies to 
promote smoking cessation and reduce the excess burden of tobacco-related 
disease in patients with SMI.

Value-Based Pricing for Emerging Gene Therapies: The Economic Case for a Higher 
Cost-Effectiveness Threshold.

While one-time gene replacement therapies may offer transformative innovation 
for the management of ultrarare, health-catastrophic diseases, they also pose 
challenges to the current U.S. health care system. Historically, the United 
States and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to support higher 
prices for health gains in rare diseases. However, payers may be ill-prepared to 
address reimbursement based on single administrations associated with gene 
therapies. As yet, there is no consensus on how to appropriately reward gene 
therapy innovation. The purpose of this article is to characterize challenges 
for traditional approaches to assessing the value of one-time gene replacement 
therapies and to provide a health economic rationale for a higher value-based 
cost-effectiveness threshold (CET). There is a general recognition that 
ultrarare, health-catastrophic conditions should be judged against a higher CET. 
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review in the United States has 
discussed a range of up to $500K per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
for ultrarare diseases, and the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence in the United Kingdom has described a variable threshold up to 
£300,000 per QALY depending on the magnitude of the health gains. In practice, 
health technology assessment decision makers often make comparisons to 
"benchmarks" to justify both standard and extraordinary CETs. We briefly review 
and present a list of relevant benchmarks. We also sketch out how a broader 
concept of value could provide the basis for higher CETs for some ultrarare 
diseases. This approach is outlined by the recent International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Special Task Force on Value Assessment 
Frameworks. In addition to the QALY gains, other elements of value related to 
uncertainty may also be important. They include insurance value, severity of 
disease, real option value, value of hope, and equity. A gene therapy currently 
in development for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) provides an 
exemplar for discussing the issues that accompany one-time gene replacement 
therapies. It is imperative that we find a consensus on how to appropriately 
reward value created by these gene therapies to incentivize appropriate risk 
taking and investments by their developers-a higher CET would, by economic 
logic, support a higher value-based price. If consensus on appropriate rewards 
cannot be found for safe and effective gene therapies for diseases such as SMA 
with clear criticality and unmet need, it will be even more difficult to do so 
for diseases where the value provided is less apparent. DISCLOSURES: Funding for

Polyketides are a structurally and functionally diverse family of bioactive 
natural products that have proven to be a rich source of pharmaceutical and 
agrochemical lead compounds. Many polyketides are biosynthesized by large 
multifunctional megaenzymes termed type I modular polyketide synthases (PKSs). 
These systems possess a distinctive assembly line-like architecture, comprising 
a series of linearly arranged, multidomain extension modules, housed in sequence 
within giant polypeptide chains. Due to their inherently modular structures, 
PKSs represent attractive targets for reengineering, enabling access to 
functionally optimized "nonnatural" natural products. In this chapter we 
describe methods for the molecular cloning, recombinant over-expression, and 
purification of intact PKS modules and multimodular PKS polypeptides. The 
usefulness of these methods is demonstrated by applying them to the study of the 
abyssomicin C PKS, a >1MDa multimodular synthase responsible for the 
biosynthesis of a polyketide antimicrobial lead compound.

BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and shigella are two major 
pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children younger than 5 
years. Diarrhoea is associated with an increased risk of stunting, which puts 
children at risk of death due to other infectious diseases.
METHODS: We modelled ETEC-related and shigella-related mortality and the effect 
of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea episodes to determine the number of children 
with stunting due to these infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income 
countries. We applied population attributable risk for increased number of 
deaths due to other infectious diseases in children who are stunted. We 
calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
FINDINGS: In children younger than 5 years, we estimate 196 million (95% UI 
135-269) episodes of ETEC and shigella diarrhoea occur annually, resulting in 
3·5 million (0·8-5·4) cases of moderate-to-severe stunting and 44 400 
(29 400-59 800) total ETEC deaths and 63 100 (44 000-81 900) total shigella 
deaths in 2015. Additional infectious disease mortality due to stunting resulted 
in increases of 24% (8-34; for ETEC) and 28% (10-39; for shigella) over direct 
deaths due to diarrhoeal episodes. The distribution of mortality and morbidity 
varied geographically, with African Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region 
countries bearing the greatest burden.
INTERPRETATION: The expanded effects of non-fatal ETEC and shigella-related 
diarrhoeal episodes can have lasting consequences. Prevention of these 
infections could reduce the risk of direct death and stunting and deaths due to 
other infectious diseases. Understanding the countries and populations with the 
highest disease risk helps to target interventions for the most vulnerable 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Higher mortality experienced by socially disadvantaged groups and/or 
racial/ethnic minorities is hypothesized to be, at least in part, due to an 
acceleration of the aging process. Using a new epigenetic aging measure, Levine 
DNAmAge, this study aimed to investigate whether epigenetic aging accounts for 
mortality disparities by race/ethnicity and education in a sample of U.S. 
postmenopausal women.
METHODS: 1834 participants from an ancillary study (BA23) in the Women's Health 
Initiative, a national study that recruited postmenopausal women (50-79 years) 
were included. Over the 22 years of follow-up, 551 women died, and 31,946 
person-years were observed. Levine DNAmAge (unit in years) was calculated based 
on an equation that we previously developed in an independent sample, which 
incorporates methylation levels at 513 CpG sites.
RESULTS: As previously reported, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were 
epigenetically older than non-Hispanic whites of the same chronological age. 
Similarly, those with less education had older epigenetic ages than expected in 
the full sample, as well as among non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, but not 
among non-Hispanic blacks. Non-Hispanic blacks and those with low education 
exhibited the greatest risk of mortality. However, this association was 
partially attenuated when accounting for differences in DNAmAge. Furthermore, 
formal mediation analysis suggested that DNAmAge partially mediated the 
mortality increase among non-Hispanic blacks, compared to non-Hispanic whites 
(proportion mediated, 15.8%, P = 0.002), as well as the mortality increase for 
those with less than high school education, compared to college educated 
(proportion mediated, 11.6%, P < 2E-16).
CONCLUSIONS: Among a group of postmenopausal women, non-Hispanic blacks and 
those with less education exhibit higher epigenetic aging, which partially 
accounts for their shorter life expectancies.

This form of asymmetric cell division depends on spindle geometry and Myosin 
distribution, but the underlying mechanics are unclear. Here, we use atomic 
force microscopy and live cell imaging to elucidate the biophysical forces 
involved in the establishment of physical asymmetry in Drosophila neural stem 
cells. We show that initial apical cortical expansion is driven by hydrostatic 
pressure, peaking shortly after anaphase onset, and enabled by a relief of 
actomyosin contractile tension on the apical cell cortex. An increase in 
contractile tension at the cleavage furrow combined with the relocalization of 
basally located Myosin initiates basal and sustains apical extension. We propose 
that spatiotemporally controlled actomyosin contractile tension and hydrostatic 
pressure enable biased cortical expansion to generate sibling cell size 
asymmetry. However, dynamic cleavage furrow repositioning can compensate for the 
lack of biased expansion to establish physical asymmetry.

    Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2018 Nov;11(11):e005093.

BACKGROUND: The CTSN (Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network) recently reported 
no difference in left ventricular end-systolic volume index or in survival at 2 
years between patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) randomized 
to mitral valve repair or replacement. However, replacement provided more 
durable correction of MR and fewer cardiovascular readmissions. Yet, 
costeffectiveness outcomes have not been addressed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the surgical 
treatment of ischemic MR based on the CTSN trial (n=126 for repair; n=125 for 
replacement). Patient-level data on readmissions, survival, qualityof- life, and 
US hospital costs were used to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years 
per patient over the trial duration and a 10-year time horizon. We performed 
microsimulation for extrapolation of outcomes beyond the 2 years of trial data. 
Bootstrap and deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to address parameter 
uncertainty. In-hospital cost estimates were $78 216 for replacement versus $72 
761 for repair (difference: $5455; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: −7784–21 193) 
while 2-year costs were $97 427 versus $96 261 (difference: $1166; 95% UI: −16 
253–17 172), respectively. Quality-adjusted life years at 2 years were 1.18 for 
replacement versus 1.23 for repair (difference: −0.05; 95% UI: −0.17 to 0.07). 
Over 5 and 10 years, the benefits of reduction in cardiovascular readmission 
rates with replacement increased, and survival minimally improved compared with 
repair. At 5 years, cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years showed no 
difference on average, but by 10 years, there was a small, uncertain benefit for 
replacement: $118 023 versus $119 837 (difference: −$1814; 95% UI: −27 144 to 22 
602) and qualityadjusted life years: 4.06 versus 3.97 (difference: 0.09; 95% UI: 
−0.87 to 1.08). After 10 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
replacement continued to improve.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cost-effectiveness analysis predicts potential savings in cost 
and gains in quality-adjusted survival at 10 years when mitral valve replacement 
is compared with repair for severe ischemic MR. These projected benefits, 
however, were small and subject to variability. Efforts to further delineate 
predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with severe ischemic MR are needed 
to optimize surgical decisions for individual patients, which should yield more 
cost-effective care.

BACKGROUND: Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems combine continuous glucose 
monitoring with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) to continuously 
self-adjust basal insulin delivery. Relative to CSII, HCL improves glycemic 
control and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia but has higher acquisition costs. 
The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the MiniMed™ 
670G HCL system versus CSII in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Sweden.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis, from a societal perspective, was performed 
over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical data were 
sourced from a study comparing the MiniMed 670G system with CSII in people with 
T1D. Cost data, expressed in 2018 Swedish krona (SEK), were obtained from 
Swedish reference prices and published literature.
RESULTS: The MiniMed 670G system was associated with a quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gain of 1.90 but higher overall costs versus CSII, leading to 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK 164,236 per QALY gained. 
Use of the HCL system resulted in a lower cumulative incidence of 
diabetes-related complications. Higher HCL system acquisition costs were 
partially offset by reduced complication costs and productivity losses. In 
people with T1D poorly controlled at baseline, the MiniMed 670G system was 
associated with 2.25 incremental QALYs versus CSII, yielding an ICER of SEK 
15,830 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The MiniMed 670G system was associated with clinical benefits and 
quality-of-life improvements in people with T1D relative to CSII. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK 300,000 per QALY gained, this HCL system 
likely represents a cost-effective treatment option for people with T1D in 
Sweden.

[The burden of mental disorders, neurological, substance use and suicide: Report 
on mental health priorities in Argentina].

The objective of this study is to provide an estimate of the burden of disease 
related to mental health in Argentina, in order to provide elements for the 
rational prioritization of resource allocation and the development of services. 
Based on the estimations made by the Study of the Global Burden of Disease (1) 
we add an analysis of the load product of: a) self-injuries and suicide; b) 
common neurological disorders with severe psychological and behavioral 
manifestations; c) somatic consequences of alcohol use disorder; and iv) an 
estimate of the disorder by somatic symptoms with prominent pain. The burden of 
disease caused by mental, neurological, substance use and suicide disorders 
(MNSS) is approximately one fifth of the years of life adjusted for disability 
(DALYs) and more than a third of the years lived with disability (ADLs) total, 
resulting in the most disabling subgroup of all non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), and far exceeding the combined group of infectious and maternal-child 
diseases, and the group of non-self-inflicted accidents and injuries. The 
analysis of DALYs by age and sex allows a hierarchy of the disorders that should 
guide the development of services for MNSS disorders, their integration in 
primary care, and the allocation of resources. The first level of care is the 
only one with a relatively homogeneous presence throughout the country, being 
the only one capable of effectively increasing coverage and reducing inequality. 
The strengthening of the first level of care can be achieved through training in 
mental health of non-specialized personnel and the use of computer and 
communication technology resources to counteract regional inequities in 
coverage. Such strategic vision will allow to diminish: the excessive expenses 
in specialized resources, which by definition are more expensive and intervene 
only when the pathology exceeded a certain threshold; and the indirect costs 
caused by the loss of labor productivity. Fundamentally, it will allow 
increasing coverage and reversing regional and socioeconomic inequality in the 
quality of mental health care in a country rich in professional resources.

Medical care of patients with disorders of aromatic amino acid metabolism: a 
report based on the Polish National Health Fund data records.

[Article in English]

Sykut-Cegielska J, Taybert J.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with disorders of aromatic amino acid metabolism are 
a heterogeneous group. They vary in morbidity and medical care requirements. 
Polish newborn screening program allows for quick diagnosis of some inborn 
errors of metabolism (such as classical phenylketonuria, mild 
hyperphenylalaninemias, tyrosinemia type 1 and tyrosinemia type 2) and 
subsequent immediate treatment.
THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the effect of the Polish public healthcare 
system in terms of management and access to health care services for children 
and adults with disorders of aromatic amino acid metabolism.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis was based on the National Health Fund (NFZ) 
reporting data for 2009-2015. The analysis included patients with disorders of 
aromatic amino acid metabolism converting ICD-10 coding according to the 
International Classification of Diseases. The analysis covered patients with 
codes E70, E70.0, E70.1, E70.2, E70.3, E70.8, E70.9. The analysis was prepared 
as part of the mapping of health needs in metabolic diseases, 
http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/.
RESULTS: In 2009-2015, 4090 patients with disorders of aromatic amino acid 
metabolism were registered in the NFZ system. The largest number of patients 
were hospitalized and registered in outpatient specialistic care (AOS) in the 
first year of life. After the second year of life, the number of hospitalized 
patients was almost zero, and the number of children (< 18 years) with AOS 
according to age was stable. After the 18 years of age the number of patients in 
the AOS gradually decreased. The population of patients aged 0-28 years 
accounted for 99% of all cases, after 28 years of age were only one percent of 
the total population. There were 95 deaths, the average age of death was 77 
years. In the whole study group the highest number of deaths was recorded after 
70 years of age, 21% of all deaths were reported in both working-age patients 
children (2 deaths). Patients with classical phenylketonuria were the most 
commonly reported in the AOS. 22% of patients were coded with ICD-10 as E70 
without extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Children aged 0-18 years with disorders of amino acid metabolism 
had full access to a well-organized specialized medical care system in Poland. 
In contrast, care for adult patients with the disorders was limited. It is 
necessary to properly code the disease using ICD-10 extension codes in order to 
avoid inconsistency in data reporting or misdiagnosis.

Publisher: WPROWADZENIE: Pacjenci z zaburzeniami przemiany aminokwasów 
aromatycznych stanowią niejednorodną grupę. Różnią się chorobowością oraz 
wymaganiami dotyczącymi opieki medycznej. Ogólnopolski program badań 
przesiewowych noworodków umożliwia szybkie rozpoznanie chorób z tej grupy, w tym 
klasycznej fenyloketonurii, łagodnych hiperfenyloalaninemii oraz tyrozynemii 
typu 1 i tyrozynemii typu 2, z następowym natychmiastowym wdrożeniem leczenia.
CEL PRACY: Ocena działania polskiego systemu opieki publicznej w aspekcie 
organizacji i dostępu do świadczeń dla dzieci i dorosłych z zaburzeniami 
przemiany aminokwasów aromatycznych.
MATERIAŁ I METODY: Analizę przeprowadzono na podstawie danych sprawozdawczych 
Narodowego Funduszu Zdrowia (NFZ) w latach 2009–2015. Do analizy włączono 
pacjentów z zaburzeniami przemiany aminokwasów aromatycznych kodowanych kodami 
ICD-10 według Międzynarodowej Klasyfikacji Chorób i Problemów Zdrowotnych, 
analizą objęto pacjentów z kodami: E70, E70.0, E70.1, E70.2, E70.3, E70.8, 
E70.9. Przeprowadzona analiza została przygotowana w ramach opracowania 
dotyczącego map potrzeb zdrowotnych w zakresie chorób metabolicznych, 
http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/.
WYNIKI: W latach 2009–2015 zarejestrowano w systemie NFZ 4090 pacjentów z 
zaburzeniami przemiany aminokwasów aromatycznych. Największa liczba pacjentów 
była hospitalizowana oraz objęta ambulatoryjną opieką specjalistyczną (AOS) w 
pierwszym roku życia. Po 2. roku życia liczba pacjentów hospitalizowanych była 
bliska zeru. Liczba dzieci (< 18. roku życia) wykazywanych w AOS w zależności od 
wieku utrzymywała się na stałym poziomie, po 18. roku życia liczba pacjentów 
stopniowo się zmniejszała. Populacja chorych w wieku 0–28 lat stanowiła 99% 
wszystkich przypadków, pacjenci po 28. roku życia stanowili tylko jeden procent 
całej badanej populacji. Stwierdzono 95 zgonów, średni wiek zgonu wynosił 77 
lat. W całej badanej grupie najwięcej zgonów zanotowano po 70. roku życia, 21% 
wszystkich zgonów stwierdzono u pacjentów w wieku produkcyjnym oraz dzieci (2 
zgony). W AOS najczęściej wykazywano pacjentów z klasyczną fenyloketonurią; 22% 
pacjentów zakodowano kodem bez rozszerzenia E70.
WNIOSKI: Dzieci (0–18 lat) z zaburzeniami metabolizmu aminokwasów aromatycznych 
były objęte od urodzenia specjalistyczną opieką medyczną. Stwierdzono 
niedostateczną opiekę nad pacjentami dorosłymi z tymi schorzeniami. W celu 
uniknięcia błędów w raportowaniu danych konieczne jest właściwe kodowanie 
jednostek chorobowych z zastosowaniem szczegółowych kodów z rozszerzeniem wg 
klasyfikacji ICD-10.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by bone pain, pathologic fractures, bone 
destruction, and secondary hypercalcemia, all these conditions impact on 
health-related quality of life of patients. The objective was to evaluate the 
global health state and health-related quality of life in a group of patients 
with MM who attended a tertiary health-care center of the Instituto Mexicano del 
Seguro Social in Mexico, through the questionnaires designed by European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life group. 
Exploratory cross-sectional study in patients with MM treated in a Department of 
Hematology in a High-Specialty Medical Unit was conducted. Patients older than 
18 years of age, men and women, were selected, and their informed written 
consent was obtained. We included all consecutive cases treated from January 
2012 to December 2014. Questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-MY20, and EORTC 
IN-PATSAT-32 were used. We studied 37 patients, 19 (51%) men and 18 women. The 
mean age was 61.9 years. Twenty-two (59.46%) patients presented with clinical 
stage III. The mean time for diagnosis was 33.11 months. The most used 
first-line treatment schedule was melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide (15; 40%). 
The global health median was 66.67, and symptoms showed a median score of 22.22. 
Treatment side effects score was 16.67; for general satisfaction, the median 
score was 75. In conclusion, the patients showed an advanced clinical stage and 
poor prognosis but had scores higher than 50 in functional scales and lower than 
50 for symptom scales. The scores for symptom scales were related to age, renal 
failure, and disease-free survival. Identification of quality of life and 
satisfaction of care markers allow for early therapeutic intervention and 
efficiency and enable a change in quality of life and perception of care in 
Health Services.

OBJECTIVES: To provide accurate risk estimates of serious adverse events after 
elective shoulder replacement surgery for arthritis, including age and sex 
specific estimates of the lifetime risk of revision surgery.
DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
SETTING: Hospital episode statistics for NHS England, including civil 
registration mortality data.
PARTICIPANTS: 58 054 elective shoulder replacements in 51 895 adults (aged ≥50 
years) between April 1998 and April 2017.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The lifetime risk of revision surgery, calculated using 
an actuarial life table approach and the cumulative probability method. Rates of 
serious adverse events at 30 and 90 days post-surgery: pulmonary embolism, 
myocardial infarction, lower respiratory tract infection, acute kidney injury, 
urinary tract infection, cerebrovascular events, and all cause death. Secondary 
outcome measures were the number of surgeries performed each year and 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of revision risk at 3, 5, 10, and 15 years.
RESULTS: The number of shoulder replacements performed each year increased 
5.6-fold between 1998 and 2017. Lifetime risks of revision surgery ranged from 1 
in 37 (2.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.6% to 2.8%) in women aged 85 years and 
older to 1 in 4 (23.6%, 23.2% to 24.0%) in men aged 55-59 years. The risks of 
revision were highest during the first five years after surgery. The risk of any 
serious adverse event at 30 days post-surgery was 1 in 28 (3.5%, 3.4% to 3.7%), 
and at 90 days post-surgery was 1 in 22 (4.6%, 4.4% to 4.8%). At 30 days, the 
relative risk of pulmonary embolism compared with baseline population risk was 
61 (95% confidence interval 50 to 73) for women aged 50-64. Serious adverse 
events were associated with increasing age, comorbidity, and male sex. 1 in 5 
(21.2%, 17.9% to 25.1%) men aged 85 years and older experienced at least one 
serious adverse event within 90 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients, particularly men, need to be aware of a higher 
likelihood of early failure of shoulder replacement and the need for further and 
more complex revision replacement surgery. All patients should be counselled 
about the risks of serious adverse events. These risks are higher than 
previously considered, and for some could outweigh any potential benefits. Our 
findings caution against unchecked expansion of shoulder replacement surgery in 
both younger and older patients. The more accurate age and sex specific 
estimates of risk from this study are long overdue and should improve shared 
decision making between patients and clinicians.

Pompe disease (OMIM 232300) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
mutations in the gene encoding acid α-glucosidase (GAA) (EC 3.2.1.20), the 
enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. The primary cellular 
pathology is lysosomal glycogen accumulation in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, 
and motor neurons, which ultimately results in cardiorespiratory failure. 
However, the severity of pathology and its impact on clinical outcomes are 
poorly described in smooth muscle. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) in 2006 has improved clinical outcomes in infantile-onset Pompe disease 
patients. Although ERT increases patient life expectancy and ventilator free 
survival, it is not entirely curative. Persistent motor neuron pathology and 
weakness of respiratory muscles, including airway smooth muscles, contribute to 
the need for mechanical ventilation by some patients on ERT. Some patients on 
ERT continue to experience life-threatening pathology to vascular smooth muscle, 
such as aneurysms or dissections within the aorta and cerebral arteries. Better 
characterization of the disease impact on smooth muscle will inform treatment 
development and help anticipate later complications. This review summarizes the 
published knowledge of smooth muscle pathology associated with Pompe disease in 
animal models and in patients.

Life expectancy is constantly increasing in developed countries. Unfortunately, 
a longer life does not always correspond to a healthier life, as even normal 
aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased risk factors for 
neurodegenerative diseases. Episodic memory (EM) is one of the most vulnerable 
cognitive functions in aging, and its decline is the hallmark of typical 
Alzheimer's disease. This memory system is defined as the ability to acquire and
