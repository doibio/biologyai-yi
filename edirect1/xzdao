BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most life-threatening vector-borne diseases 
globally. Recent autochthonous cases registered in several European countries 
have raised awareness regarding the threat of malaria reintroduction to Europe. 
An increasing number of imported malaria cases today occur due to international 
travel and migrant flows from malaria-endemic countries. The cumulative factors 
of the presence of competent vectors, favourable climatic conditions and 
evidence of increasing temperatures might lead to the re-emergence of malaria in 
countries where the infection was previously eliminated.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review following PRISMA 
guidelines. We searched for original articles focusing on rising temperature and 
the receptivity to malaria transmission in Europe. We evaluated the quality of 
the selected studies using a standardised tool.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 1'999 articles of possible relevance and after 
screening we included 10 original research papers in the quantitative analysis 
for the systematic review. With further increasing temperatures studies 
predicted a northward spread of the occurrence of Anopheles mosquitoes and an 
extension of seasonality, enabling malaria transmission for annual periods up to 
6 months in the years 2051-2080. Highest vector stability and receptivity were 
predicted in Southern and South-Eastern European areas. Anopheles atroparvus, 
the main potential malaria vector in Europe, might play an important role under 
changing conditions favouring malaria transmission.
CONCLUSION: The receptivity of Europe for malaria transmission will increase as 
a result of rising temperature unless socioeconomic factors remain favourable 
and appropriate public health measures are implemented. Our systematic review 
serves as an evidence base for future preventive measures.

BACKGROUND: Distant metastases in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) are common. 
There is no consensus on the management of metastatic disease because no 
therapeutic approach has demonstrated improvement in overall survival (OS) and 
because of prolonged life expectancy. The aim of this study is to build and 
validate a prognostic nomogram for metastatic ACC patients.
METHODS: The study end-point was OS, measured from the date of first metastatic 
presentation to death/last follow-up. A retrospective analysis including 
metastatic ACC patients was performed to build the prognostic nomogram at the 
INT (Milan, Italy). The model was validated on an independent cohort of patients 
with similar characteristics treated at Leuven (Belgium). Outcome data and 
covariates were modelled by resorting to a random forest method. This 
machine-learning approach was used to guide and benchmark the subsequent use of 
more conventional modelling methods. Cox model performance was assessed in terms 
of discrimination (Harrell's c-index).
RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-eight patients with metastatic ACC (testing set 259 
INT, validation set 39 Leuven) were studied. Akaike Information Criterion-based 
backward selection yielded a 5-factor model showing a bias-corrected c-index of 
0.730. Five independent prognostic factors were found: gender, disease-free 
interval and presence of lung, liver or bone metastases. Nomogram discrimination 
in the validation series was c = 0.701.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis allowed the building of an externally 
validated prognostic nomogram. This tool might help clinicians to discriminate 
patients requiring prompt management from who can benefit from a 'watchful 
waiting'. In addition, the nomogram might be useful to stratify patients in 
clinical trials.

RATIONAL: Intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL) is a rare disease characterized by 
dilatation and rupture of intestinal lymphatic channels leading to 
protein-losing enteropathy. IL is classified as primary and secondary types.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month-old girl born at term from vaginal delivery with an 
APGAR score of 10/10 and birth weight of 4.310 g (>97° percentile) was admitted 
to our hospital because of increasing abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. At 
first examination, she presented an abdominal circumference of 60 cm, edema of 
the lower extremities and vulva, and facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, flat 
nasal bridge, flat mid-face).
DIAGNOSIS: Once admitted, ultrasonography showed a large amount of ascites, 
while blood laboratory investigations revealed severe hypoproteinemia, 
hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Lymphoscintigraphy with 
99m-Tc-nanocolloid demonstrated abnormal leakage of the tracer in the abdomen as 
evidence of IL. To detect a possible secondary, exams were performed and 
demonstrated positive antibody titres for CMV-IgM and IgG in blood and CMV-DNA 
positivity in blood, urine, saliva, maternal milk, and gastric and duodenal 
biopsies. Genetic investigations identified the genomic variant c.472C>T of the 
CCBE1 gene, coding for a protein variant (p.Arg158Cys), in homozygosity.
INTERVENTIONS: Total parenteral nutrition was started and continued for a total 
of 18 days, then gradually bridged by enteral nutrition with a special formula. 
In addition, antiviral therapy for CMV infection was added first with 
intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days, resulting in the disappearance of blood 
viral load after 7 days of therapy and then with valganciclovir per os for 
another 30 days.
OUTCOMES: The clinical course of the child gradually improved. A few days after 
starting treatments, lower extremities and vulvar edema disappeared, and 
abdominal circumference gradually decreased to a stable value of 38 cm, without 
any ultrasonographic signs of ascites left. Moreover, serum albumin and IgG rose 
to normal values after 3 months (4.3 g/dL and 501 mg/dL, respectively).
LESSONS: This case suggests that in presence of IL both primary and secondary 
causes should be evaluated. On the other hand, genetic diagnosis is crucial not 
only for diagnosis but also for prognosis in HS. Life expectancy and quality 
could deeply vary among different gene mutations and protein variants of the 
same gene. Further studies and case reports are needed to better understand the 
clinical meaning of these genetic results and the role of CMV as trigger of IL.

The Western lifestyle is a complex concept that includes the diet as the main 
axis of different factors which contribute to a detrimental effect on health, 
lower life expectancy and low quality-of-life. This type of diet is 
characterized by being high in calories, mainly provided by saturated fats, and 
rich in sugars that can lead to changes in immune cells and their 
responsiveness, by different mechanisms that have yet to be totally clarified. 
Inflammatory processes are perpetuated through different pathways, in which 
adipose tissue is a major factor. High fat stores in overweight and obesity 
accumulate energy but the endocrine function is also producing and releasing 
different bioactive compounds, adipokines, known to be pro-inflammatory and 
which play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. This review 
therefore explores the latest evidence regarding the adverse effect of the 
Western diet on adipose tissue inflammation and its causative effect on the 
asthma epidemic.

BACKGROUND: There is a positive association between raised resting heart rate 
(RHR), and all causes of mortality and shorter life expectancy. Several serum 
biomarkers and some anthropometric factors can affect the resting heart rate. 
This study aimed to investigate the determinants of resting heart rate in a 
large random sample of the Iranian population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: It is a standardized, retrospective study and the subjects 
were chosen from the baseline survey of the Prospective Epidemiological Research 
Study in IrAN (PERSIAN) Fasa non-communicable disease cohort study. It was 
conducted from winter 2014 to summer 2019 and after obtaining informed consent 
from a random sample, all the eligible subjects were enrolled. All 
anthropometric factors and biologic laboratory factors were collected and 
analyzed by implement smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) linear 
regression and SCAD quantile regression. The comparisons between males and 
females were done via independent T-test.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: A total number of 9975 persons from 35 to 90 years old 
were included. The overall median resting heart rate was 74 (interquartile 
range:66-80). Mean age has no important difference between males and females 
(P = 0.79) but, resting heart rate was significantly higher in females (76.6 
versus 71.4, P < 0.001). All anthropometric factors except wrist circumference 
were higher in females (P < 0.05). Age has an adverse effect on resting heart 
rate and also, there was a direct association between resting heart rate and 
systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. Alpha-blockers (coefficient = 5.2) 
and Beta1-blockers (coefficient = - 2.2) were the most effective drugs with 
positive and negative effects on resting heart rate respectively. Lower 
hemoglobin, obesity, and more body mass index, and more low-density lipoprotein 
were associated with more resting heart rate. Continuing the monitoring of this 
sample via our cohort study and put to action multinational prospective 
researches with large sample sizes and long follow-ups can lead to more precise 
results and better scientific judgments.

BACKGROUND: Most previous research has studied the association of hypertension 
with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality by focusing on the 
transition from the initial state to a single outcome. We investigated the 
impact of hypertension, defined according to the 2017 American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) (new) and the Seventh Report of 
the Joint National Committee (JNC7) (old), on CVD death and all-cause mortality 
considering non-fatal CVD as an intermediate event between two CVD-free and 
mortality states.
METHODS: A total of 3002 Iranian population (47.4% men), aged ≥50 years were 
followed from 1999 to 2014. Two multi-state semi-Markov models with three 
transitions were defined for CVD death and all-cause mortality as two outcomes. 
The multivariable Cox model was used to estimate the effect of hypertension on 
transition hazards. The mean of 15-year life expectancy of participants in each 
transition was estimated using the restricted mean survival time.
RESULTS: The ACC/AHA guideline increased the prevalence of hypertension from 
43.3 to 68.6%. Among CVD-free individuals, hypertension was significantly 
associated with increased risk of non-fatal CVD [Hazard Ratio, 1.52 (1.28-1.81) 
and 1.48 (1.21-1.80)], CVD death [2.96 (2.06-4.25) and 1.98 (1.30-3.04)] and 
all-cause mortality [1.64 (1.32-2.05) and 1.31 (1.01-1.69)] according the old 
and new guidelines, respectively. However, after incident non-fatal CVD, the 
association between hypertension and mortality events was not significant 
according to both definitions. Hypertensive participants experienced a first 
non-fatal CVD about 0.9 and 0.6 years earlier than normotensive population 
according to JNC7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension, according to JNC7 and the ACC/AHA guidelines, 
significantly increased the risk of mortality events among CVD-free population 
although the risk was attenuated using ACC/AHA guideline. Hypertension also 
decreased the number of years lived without CVD and early onset of CVD, and 
consequently, an increase in the time spent with these diseases. After non-fatal 
CVD, hypertension had no significant impact on mortality risk according to both 
guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Conventional CTCS images the mid/lower chest for coronary artery 
disease (CAD). Because many CAD patients are also at risk for lung malignancy, 
CTCS often discovers incidental pulmonary nodules (IPN). CTCS excludes the upper 
chest, where malignancy is common. Full-chest CTCS (FCT) may be a cost-effective 
screening tool for IPN.
METHODS: A decision tree was created to compare a FCT to CTCS in a hypothetical 
patient cohort with suspected CAD. (Figure) The design compares the effects of 
missed cancers on CTCS with the cost of working up non-malignant nodules on FCT. 
The model was informed by results of the National Lung Screening Trial and 
literature review, including the rate of malignancy among patients receiving 
CTCS and the rate of malignancy in upper vs lower portions of the lung. The 
analysis outcomes are Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is generally considered beneficial when 
<$50,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Literature review suggests that rate of IPNs in the upper portion of 
the lung varied from 47 to 76%. Our model assumed that IPNs occur in upper and 
lower portions of the lung with equal frequency. The model also assumes an equal 
malignancy potential in upper lung IPNs despite data that malignancy occurs 
61-66% in upper lung fields. In the base case analysis, a FCT will lead to an 
increase of 0.03 QALYs comparing to conventional CTCS (14.54 vs 14.51 QALY, 
respectively), which translates into an QALY increase of 16 days. The associated 
incremental cost for FCT is $278 ($1027 vs $748, FCT vs CTCS respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is $10,289/QALY, suggesting 
significant benefit. Sensitivity analysis shows this benefit increases 
proportional to the rate of malignancy in upper lung fields.
CONCLUSION: Conventional CTCS may be a missed opportunity to screen for upper 
lung field cancers in high risk patients. The ICER of FCT is better than 
screening for breast cancer screening (mammograms $80 k/QALY) and colon cancer 
(colonoscopy $6 k/QALY). Prospective studies are appropriate to define protocols 
for FCT.

Telehealth and indigenous populations around the world: a systematic review on 
current modalities for physical and mental health.

Approximately 370-500 million Indigenous people live worldwide. While Indigenous 
peoples make up only 5% of the world's population, they account for 15% of the 
extreme poor and have life expectancy that is 20 years shorter than that of 
non-Indigenous people. Access to healthcare has been identified as an important 
social determinant of health and key driver of health outcomes. Indigenous 
populations often face barriers to accessing healthcare including living in 
remote areas, lacking financial resources, and having cultural differences. 
Telehealth, the utililzation of any synchronous modality, including phone, 
video, or teleconferencing technology used to support the provision of 
long-distance health care and health education, is a feasible and cost-effective 
treatment delivery mechanism that has successfully addressed access barriers 
faced by vulnerable populations globally, however, few studies have included 
indigenous populations and the application of this technology to improve 
physical and mental health outcomes. This systematic review aims to identify 
trials that were conducted among Indigenous adults, and to summarize the 
components of interventions that have been found to effectively improve the 
health of Indigenous peoples. The PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic 
reviews were followed in preparing this manuscript. Studies were identified by 
searching PubMed, Scopus, and PsychInfo databases for clinical trial articles on 
Indigenous peoples and mental and physical health, published between January 1, 
1998 and December 31, 2018. Eligibility criteria for determining studies to 
include in the analysis were as follows: (I) ≥18 years of age; (II) indigenous 
peoples; (III) any technology-based intervention; (IV) studies included at least 
one of the following mental health (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
suicide) and physical health (mortality, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, 
cholesterol, quality of life) outcomes; (V) clinical trials. A total of 2,662 
articles were identified and six were included in the final review based on 
pre-specified eligibility criteria. Three were conducted in the United States, 
one study was conducted in Canada, and two were conducted in New Zealand. Study 
sample sizes ranged from 20 to 762, intervention delivery times ranged from 
three to 20 months and utilized telephone, internet and SMS messaging as the 
type of technology. There is a paucity of evidence on the use of telehealth 
programs to increase access to chronic disease programs in Indigenous 
populations. This review highlights the importance of culturally tailoring 
programs despite the modality in which they are delivered, and recommends 
telephone-based delivery facilitated by a trained health professional. 
Telehealth has great promise for meeting the health needs of highly marginalized 
Indigenous populations around the world, however, at this point more research is 
needed to understand how best to structure and deliver these programs for 
maximum effect.

Risankizumab (Skyrizi®; risankizumab-rzaa) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 
monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the p19 subunit of interleukin 
(IL)-23, thereby inhibiting IL-23-dependent cell signaling. Subcutaneous 
risankizumab is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy (in the EU), those who 
are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy (in the USA) and those who 
have an inadequate response to conventional therapies (in Japan). In pivotal 
phase III trials (UltIMMa-1, UltIMMa-2, IMMvent and IMMhance), risankizumab was 
more effective than placebo, ustekinumab and adalimumab with regard to the 
proportion of patients achieving ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index score (PASI 90) and a static Physician's Global 
Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 16, with these benefits maintained over the 
longer term. In supportive head-to-head trials, risankizumab was also superior 
to secukinumab and fumaric acid esters in terms of PASI 90 response rate. In an 
ongoing open-label extension study (LIMMitless), risankizumab was associated 
with durable and improved efficacy after switching from ustekinumab or 
adalimumab, as well as durable maintenance of efficacy through > 2.5 years of 
continuous exposure. Treatment with risankizumab improved health-related quality 
of life and was generally well tolerated, both in the short- and longer-term. In 
conclusion, risankizumab represents a useful new treatment option for patients 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

The expression of genes and their regulation during lactation in Ghezel sheep 
breed remains less understood. To explore the underlying molecular mechanism of 
the lactation process in the mammary gland, transcriptome profiles of Iranian 
fat-tailed Ghezel sheep breed milk at two stages, before (BF) and after peak 
(AF) stages of lactation were investigated. Functional impacts of differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between BF and AF stages were surveyed using Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. Totally, 
75 DEGs were identified between BF and AF stages of lactation. The RNA-Seq 
results were validated by Q-RT-PCR. Gene ontology of DEGs mainly enriched in 
metabolic process and oxidative phosphorylation. PPI network analysis also 
highlighted the contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors 
(PPAR) signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways in the 
lactation process. Intriguingly, the genes involved in fat metabolism dominantly 
down-regulated at AF stage. Our results provide new insight into transcriptional 
changes and add to growing body of knowledge on the lactation process in 
fat-tailed sheep breeds.

Psychotic disorders and electrocardiogram abnormalities in the acute psychiatric 
setting: more than the metabolic syndrome alone.

Philip AB(1), Dratcu L(1).

Author information:
(1)South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.

Medical comorbidity in severe mental illness (SMI) is high and often severe, 
accounting for reduced life expectancy in this group. We assessed the rate and 
degree of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in acutely unwell SMI male 
patients by reviewing the case notes of 50 consecutive admissions to an 
inpatient psychiatric unit. 82% were admitted with a psychotic disorder with a 
median age of 35 (range 19 - 72 years). Of the 29 patients who had an ECG during 
admission or recently (<90 days) prior to admission, 21% had a clinically 
relevant abnormality. 42% of patients did not have an ECG during admission or 
recently. Results indicate that SMI patients requiring acute care, in addition 
to metabolic disorders, may also have significant ECG abnormalities from a young 
age. Comprehensive medical monitoring, including regular ECGs and use of 
preventive strategies, should be an integral part of management of SMI from the 
outset.KEY POINTSThis small study found that out of 50 patients admitted to an 
acute psychiatric unit, 29 (58%) had a recent (<90 days) electrocardiogram 
(ECG); 6 of them (21%) had clinically relevant ECG abnormalities.ECG 
abnormalities were found in 24% (n = 10) of patients who had at least 1 
documented ECG ever performed (n = 41, 82%).42% of patients did not have an ECG 
performed in the 90 days prior to or during admission.Results indicate that 
patients with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) requiring acute care are at risk of 
metabolic disorders and ECG abnormalities from a young age.Comprehensive medical 
monitoring including regular ECGs and early preventive strategies should be part 
of SMI patients' management plans from the outset. Larger scale studies are 
needed to assess the impact of early intervention on cardiovascular risk in SMI.

BACKGROUND: Continuing tuberculosis control with current approaches is unlikely 
to reach the World Health Organization's objective to eliminate TB by 2035. 
Innovative interventions such as unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) and 
digital adherence monitoring technologies have the potential to enhance 
patient-centric quality tuberculosis care and help challenged National 
Tuberculosis Programs leapfrog over the impediments of conventional Directly 
Observed Therapy (DOTS) implementation. A bundle of innovative interventions 
referred to for its delivery technology as the Drone Observed Therapy System 
(DrOTS) was implemented in remote Madagascar. Given the potentially increased 
cost these interventions represent for health systems, a cost-effectiveness 
analysis was indicated.
METHODS: A decision analysis model was created to calculate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of the DrOTS strategy compared to DOTS, the standard of care, 
in a study population of 200,000 inhabitants in rural Madagascar with 
tuberculosis disease prevalence of 250/100,000. A mixed top-down and bottom-up 
costing approach was used to identify costs associated with both models, and net 
costs were calculated accounting for resulting TB treatment costs. Net cost per 
disability-adjusted life years averted was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed for key input variables to identify main drivers of health and cost 
outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.
FINDINGS: Net cost per TB patient identified within DOTS and DrOTS were, 
respectively, $282 and $1,172. The incremental cost per additional TB patient 
diagnosed in DrOTS was $2,631 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
DrOTS compared to DOTS was $177 per DALY averted. Analyses suggest that 
integrating drones with interventions ensuring highly sensitive laboratory 
testing and high treatment adherence optimizes cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: Innovative technology packages including drones, digital adherence 
monitoring technologies, and molecular diagnostics for TB case finding and 
retention within the cascade of care can be cost effective. Their integration 
with other interventions within health systems may further lower costs and 
support access to universal health coverage.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term costs and impact on quality of life of 
using prophylactic dextrose gel in patients at increased risk of developing 
neonatal hypoglycemia.
STUDY DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of the 
health system, using a decision tree to model the long-term clinical outcomes of 
neonatal hypoglycemia, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, vision disturbances, 
and learning disabilities, in patients at increased risk of neonatal 
hypoglycemia who received prophylactic dextrose gel vs standard care. Model 
parameters including likelihoods of hypoglycemia and admission to a neonatal 
intensive care unit, were based on the pre-Hypoglycemia Prevention with Oral 
Dextrose Study. Estimations of the likelihood of long-term condition(s), and 
their costs, were based on review of published literature.
RESULTS: Patients who received prophylactic dextrose gel incurred costs to the 
health system of around US $14 000 over an 18-year time horizon, accruing 11.25 
quality-adjusted life-years, whereas those who did not receive prophylactic 
treatment incurred cost of around $16 000 and experienced a utility of 11.10 
quality-adjusted life-years.
CONCLUSIONS: A prophylactic strategy of using dextrose gel in infants at 
increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia is likely to be cost effective compared 
with standard care, to reduce the direct costs to the health system over an 
18-year time horizon, and improve quality of life.

AIMS: The majority of children with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) 
survive into adulthood due to advances in medical care. Adult patients with CHD 
have an increased incidence of diagnoses related to ageing such as heart 
failure, dementia, cancer and sarcopenia, despite a relatively low age. They 
also have a shorter life expectancy. It is unknown if their bone structures also 
show signs of premature ageing. We therefore investigated Bone Mineral Content 
(BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in an adult population with complex CHD.
METHODS: The total body BMC and BMD was examined using dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) in 73 adults with complex CHD (mean age 35.8 ± 14.3, women 
n = 22) and 73 age and sex matched controls.
RESULTS: The adults with complex CHD had lower total body BMC (2.6 ± 0.5 kg vs. 
2.9 ± 0.5 kg, p < 0.001) and BMD (1.18 ± 0.12 g/cm2vs. 1.26 ± 0.11 g/cm2, 
p < 0.001) compared to controls. BMD was lower for patients with single 
ventricle physiology and for the other complex diagnoses, and it persisted after 
correction for most common risk factors for osteoporosis.
CONCLUSION: Adults with complex CHD have reduced total body BMC and BMD compared 
to healthy controls. These results are a sign of frailty that conforms with 
other previously reported signs of premature ageing. The risk of osteoporosis is 
low in our relatively young population, but it is assumed to increase with 
ageing. We recommend that clinicians pay close attention to risk factors for 
osteoporosis, and are generous in administering DXA-measurements in order to 
prevent future fractures among adults with complex CHD.

Premature mortality is an important public health indicator with ramifications 
to social and economic outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine whether 
premature mortality, measured by the years of potential life lost (YPLL), 
converges among the U.S. states and which mortality components lead to 
divergence. To this end, we calculate the YPLL and apply the Phillips and Sul 
(2007, 2009) convergence test methodology. We find that for males and blacks all 
U.S. states converge to a steady-state while for females, whites and total 
population, the states form convergence clubs. These clubs differ mainly due to 
variances in infant, cardiovascular and unintentional injury mortalities with 
the ones with the lesser YPLL located mainly on the west and east coast.

For college students, mental health is an important factor in ensuring their 
ability to study and have a normal life. This research focuses on factors 
affecting the mental health of college students in the information network 
society. We constructed a theoretical model that influences their online mental 
health information seeking behavior from internal and external perspectives, and 
by extension, affects their mental health. Through the data obtained by field 
research and questionnaire survey on the online mental health information 
seeking behavior of some college students in Internet health information 
platforms, a structural equation model is used to test the hypotheses. Results 
show that the quality of external Internet platforms and the quality of internal 
electronic health literacy have a significantly positive impact on the online 
health information searching behavior of college students; electronic health 
literacy and online mental health information seeking behavior have 
significantly direct positive effects on college students' mental health. 
Further, online health information searching behavior has a significant 
mediating effect between Internet platform quality, electronic health literacy, 
and college students' mental health. The research conclusions have theoretical 
value and practical significance to study the factors influencing college 
students' mental health in the context of information network society.

As jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) age in South Korea, the cost of 
pavement maintenance is increasing annually. To extend the life of jointed 
concrete pavements through preventive maintenance, this study used 2017 pavement 
management system data to analyze the effects of traffic volume, alkali-silica 
reaction (ASR) grade, age, smoothness, and damaged area on the remodeling index 
(RMI-a measure of expressway pavement condition). In addition, this study 
evaluates the final RMI as well as the corresponding pavement condition and 
change in RMI value after conducting preventive maintenance in lieu of 
resurfacing or overlaying. The results demonstrated that the effect of ASR grade 
increased as the RMI forecast year increased and that change in surface distress 
(△SD) increased with age (most intensively when the pavement was 15-20 years of 
age). Moreover, change in international roughness index (△IRI) increased with 
age and traffic volume (similarly within 15-20 years of pavement age). Hence, 
preventive maintenance is a must for sections with high traffic volume and age 
even if the RMI is low. Finally, performing repairs through preventive 
maintenance decreases the number of expressway sections requiring resurfacing 
and overlaying, thus extending the life of the concrete pavement.

BACKGROUND: The UK government introduced social distancing measures between 
16-22 March 2020, aiming to slow down transmission of COVID-19.
AIM: To explore the spreading of COVID-19 in relation to population density 
after the introduction of social distancing measures.
DESIGN & SETTING: Longitudinal design with 5-weekly COVID-19 incidence rates per 
100 000 people for 149 English Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs), between 16 
March and 19 April 2020.
METHOD: Multivariable multilevel model to analyse weekly incidence rates per 100 
000 people; time was level-1 unit and UTLA level-2 unit. Population density was 
divided into quartiles. The model included an interaction between week and 
population density. Potential confounders were percentage aged ≥65, percentage 
non-white British, and percentage in two highest classes of the National 
Statistics Socioeconomic Classification. Co-variates were male life expectancy 
at birth, and COVID-19 prevalence rate per 100 000 people on March 15. 
Confounders and co-variates were standardised around the mean.
RESULTS: Incidence rates per 100 000 people peaked in the week of March 30-April 
5, showing higher adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 people (46.2; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 40.6 to 51.8) in most densely populated ULTAs 
(quartile 4) than in less densely populated ULTAs (quartile 1: 33.3, 95% CI = 
27.4 to 37.2; quartile 2: 35.9, 95% CI = 31.6 to 40.1). Thereafter, incidence 
rate dropped in the most densely populated ULTAs resulting in rate of 22.4 (95% 
CI = 16.9 to 28.0) in the week of April 13-19; this was lower than in quartiles 
1, 2, and 3, respectively 31.4 (95% CI = 26.5 to 36.3), 34.2 (95% CI = 29.9 to 
38.5), and 43.2 (95% CI = 39.0 to 47.4).
CONCLUSION: After the introduction of social distancing measures, the incidence 
rates per 100 000 people dropped stronger in most densely populated ULTAs.

The genetics of rheumatoid arthritis.

Dedmon LE(1).

Author information:
(1)UCL Medical School, London, UK.

RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the small 
joints of the hands and feet, and results in a mean reduction in life expectancy 
of 3-10 years. RA is a multigene disorder with a substantial genetic component 
and a heritability estimate of 60%. Large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS) and meta-analyses have revealed common disease-associated variants in the 
population that may contribute cumulatively to RA pathogenesis. This review 
identifies the most significant genetic variants associated with RA 
susceptibility to date, with particular focus on the contribution of the HLA 
class II genes across different ethnic groups. Also discussed are the potential
