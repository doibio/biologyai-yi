BACKGROUND: Reducing automobile dependence and improving rates of active 
transport may reduce the impact of obesogenic environments, thereby decreasing 
population prevalence of obesity and other diseases where physical inactivity is 
a risk factor. Increasing the relative cost of driving by an increase in fuel 
taxation may therefore be a promising public health intervention for obesity 
prevention.
METHODS: A scoping review of the evidence for obesity or physical activity 
effect of changes in fuel price or taxation was undertaken. Potential health 
benefits of an increase in fuel excise taxation in Australia were quantified 
using Markov modelling to simulate obesity, injury and physical activity related 
health impacts of a fuel excise taxation intervention for the 2010 Australian 
population. Health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained and healthcare cost 
savings from diseases averted were estimated. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were reported and results were tested through sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Limited evidence on the effect of policies such as fuel taxation on 
health-related behaviours currently exists. Only three studies were identified 
reporting associations between fuel price or taxation and obesity, whilst nine 
studies reported associations specifically with physical activity, walking or 
cycling. Estimates of the cross price elasticity of demand for public transport 
with respect to fuel price vary, with limited consensus within the literature on 
a probable range for the Australian context. Cost-effectiveness modelling of a 
AUD0.10 per litre increase in fuel excise taxation using a conservative estimate 
of cross price elasticity for public transport suggests that the intervention 
would be cost-effective from a limited societal perspective (237 HALYs gained, 
AUD2.6 M in healthcare cost savings), measured against a comparator of no 
additional increase in fuel excise. Under "best case" assumptions, the 
intervention would be more cost-effective (3181 HALYs gained, AUD34.2 M in 
healthcare cost savings).
CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory analysis suggests that an intervention to increase fuel 
excise taxation may deliver obesity and physical activity related benefits. 
Whilst such an intervention has significant potential for cost-effectiveness, 
potential equity and acceptability impacts would need to be minimised. A better 
understanding of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a range of 
transport interventions is required in order to achieve more physically active 
transport environments.

The increasing number of older patients (age ≥60 years) with inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) highlights the importance of healthcare maintenance in this 
vulnerable population. Older IBD patients are more susceptible and have higher 
rates of many disease- and treatment-related adverse effects. Compared to 
younger IBD patients, older patients are at increased risk for infection, 
malignancy, bone disease, eye disease, malnutrition and thrombotic 
complications. Preventive strategies in the elderly differ from those in younger 
adults and are imperative. Changes to the immune system with aging can decrease 
the efficacy of vaccinations. Cancer screening guidelines in older IBD patients 
have to account for unique considerations, such as life expectancy, functional 
performance status, multimorbidity, financial status, and patient desires. 
Additionally, providers need to be vigilant in screening for osteoporosis, 
ocular disease, depression, and adverse events arising from polypharmacy.

Complex Ebstein's Anomaly in an 86-Year-Old Iranian Man: A Case Report.

Moradi B(1), Roshanali F(1).

Author information:
(1)Day General Hospital, Tehran, Iran.

Ebstein's anomaly is defined as the significant apical displacement of the 
tricuspid valve causing tricuspid regurgitation. Although a variety of 
concomitant lesions have been previously described, we herein introduce an 
unusual presentation. Our patient was an 86-year-old man with a primary 
presentation of typical chest pain in the setting of recently diagnosed coronary 
artery disease with concomitant Ebstein's anomaly. We found mild-to-moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, persistent left superior vena 
cava, and patent foramen ovale. The patient had suffered from chest discomfort 
on exertion for 2 months with good functional capacity prior to diagnosis. 
Coronary angiography revealed two-vessel disease. The patient refused surgery. 
He was treated with medical anti-ischemic therapy. He had good exercise 
tolerance with relief of chest pain at the latest follow-up. The features 
demonstrated in this case report suggest that there may be several adult 
survivors of complex congenital heart diseases requiring individualized surgical 
treatment plans.

SUMMARY: This case, presenting with bilateral impalpable testes, illustrates the 
relevance of a broad differential disorders of sex development case management. 
It provides new insights on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and 
testicular function abnormalities in the multisystem disorder of Lowe syndrome. 
Lowe syndrome, also known as oculocerebrorenal syndrome, is a rare disorder 
characterised by eye abnormalities, central nervous system involvement and 
proximal renal tubular acidosis. There are a handful of reports of pubertal 
delay, infertility and cryptorchidism in Lowe syndrome. Biochemistry aged 72 h: 
testosterone 6.4 nmol/L, LH <0.5 IU/L and FSH <0.5 IU/L. Gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone stimulation test identified significantly raised baseline LH = 45.4 IU/L 
(contrasts with earlier undetectable LH), with a 20% increase on stimulation, 
while baseline FSH = 4.3 IU/L with no increase on stimulation. Day 14 HCG 
stimulation test produced an acceptable 50% increase in testosterone. The 
constellation of further abnormalities suggested Lowe syndrome: hypotonia, 
bilateral cataracts (surgical extraction and intraocular lens implantation) and 
renal tubular acidosis (microscopic haematuria, hypercalciuria, proteinuria, 
generalised aminoaciduria, hypophosphataemia and metabolic acidosis). DNA 
sequencing identified de novo hemizygous frameshift mutation OCRL 
c.2409_2410delCT in exon 22. Interpretation of initial and repeat GnRH and HCG 
testing indicates the likelihood of testicular failure. Partial testicular 
descent occurred but left orchidopexy was required. Improving long-term gonadal 
function in Lowe syndrome assumes increased importance for current cohorts as 
advances in renal replacement therapy have greatly improved life expectancy. 
Noting HPG axis abnormalities in Lowe syndrome in infancy can identify cases 
requiring increased surveillance of pubertal progress for earlier detection and 
management.
LEARNING POINTS: Clinical endocrine problems in Lowe syndrome has been reported, 
but has focused on abnormalities in adolescence and young adulthood: pubertal 
delay and infertility.We present an infant with isolated LH elevation at 
baseline and on GnRH stimulation testing who also had bilateral impalpable 
testes.Early testing of the HPG axis in patients with Lowe syndrome may help 
predict gonadal abnormalities from a younger age, which will enhance the overall 
case management into adolescence.

How to Appropriately Extrapolate Costs and Utilities in Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis.

Costs and utilities are key inputs into any cost-effectiveness analysis. Their 
estimates are typically derived from individual patient-level data collected as 
part of clinical studies the follow-up duration of which is often too short to 
allow a robust quantification of the likely costs and benefits a technology will 
yield over the patient's entire lifetime. In the absence of long-term data, some 
form of temporal extrapolation-to project short-term evidence over a longer time 
horizon-is required. Temporal extrapolation inevitably involves assumptions 
regarding the behaviour of the quantities of interest beyond the time horizon 
supported by the clinical evidence. Unfortunately, the implications for 
decisions made on the basis of evidence derived following this practice and the 
degree of uncertainty surrounding the validity of any assumptions made are often 
not fully appreciated. The issue is compounded by the absence of methodological 
guidance concerning the extrapolation of non-time-to-event outcomes such as 
costs and utilities. This paper considers current approaches to predict 
long-term costs and utilities, highlights some of the challenges with the 
existing methods, and provides recommendations for future applications. It finds 
that, typically, economic evaluation models employ a simplistic approach to 
temporal extrapolation of costs and utilities. For instance, their parameters 
(e.g. mean) are typically assumed to be homogeneous with respect to both time 
and patients' characteristics. Furthermore, costs and utilities have often been 
modelled to follow the dynamics of the associated time-to-event outcomes. 
However, cost and utility estimates may be more nuanced, and it is important to 
ensure extrapolation is carried out appropriately for these parameters.

Economic evaluation of factorial randomised controlled trials: challenges, 
methods and recommendations.

Dakin H(1), Gray A(1).

Author information:

Increasing numbers of economic evaluations are conducted alongside randomised 
controlled trials. Such studies include factorial trials, which randomise 
patients to different levels of two or more factors and can therefore evaluate 
the effect of multiple treatments alone and in combination. Factorial trials can 
provide increased statistical power or assess interactions between treatments, 
but raise additional challenges for trial-based economic evaluations: 
interactions may occur more commonly for costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) than for clinical endpoints; economic endpoints raise challenges for 
transformation and regression analysis; and both factors must be considered 
simultaneously to assess which treatment combination represents best value for 
money. This article aims to examine issues associated with factorial trials that 
include assessment of costs and/or cost-effectiveness, describe the methods that 
can be used to analyse such studies and make recommendations for health 
economists, statisticians and trialists. A hypothetical worked example is used 
to illustrate the challenges and demonstrate ways in which economic evaluations 
of factorial trials may be conducted, and how these methods affect the results 
and conclusions. Ignoring interactions introduces bias that could result in 
adopting a treatment that does not make best use of healthcare resources, while 
considering all interactions avoids bias but reduces statistical power. We also 
introduce the concept of the opportunity cost of ignoring interactions as a 
measure of the bias introduced by not taking account of all interactions. We 
conclude by offering recommendations for planning, analysing and reporting 
economic evaluations based on factorial trials, taking increased analysis costs 
into account. © 2017 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the pattern of mortality 
above the age of 100 years. In particular, we aimed to examine whether 
Scandinavian data support the theory that mortality reaches a plateau at 
particularly old ages. Whether the maximum length of life increases with time 
was also investigated.
METHODS: The analyses were based on individual level data on all Swedish and 
Danish centenarians born from 1870 to 1901; in total 3006 men and 10 963 women 
were included. Birth cohort-specific probabilities of dying were calculated. 
Exact ages were used for calculations of maximum length of life. Whether maximum 
age changed over time was analysed taking into account increases in cohort size.
RESULTS: The results confirm that there has not been any improvement in 
mortality amongst centenarians in the past 30 years and that the current rise in 
life expectancy is driven by reductions in mortality below the age of 100 years. 
The death risks seem to reach a plateau of around 50% at the age 103 years for 
men and 107 years for women. Despite the rising life expectancy, the maximum age 
does not appear to increase, in particular after accounting for the increasing 
number of individuals of advanced age.
CONCLUSION: Mortality amongst centenarians is not changing despite improvements 
at younger ages. An extension of the maximum lifespan and a sizeable extension 
of life expectancy both require reductions in mortality above the age of 100 
years.

OBJECTIVE: Patients in the ICU are at the greatest risk of contracting 
healthcare-associated infections like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus. This study calculates the cost-effectiveness of methicillin-resistant S 
aureus prevention strategies and recommends specific strategies based on 
screening test implementation.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from the hospital 
perspective was conducted to determine if the implementation costs of 
methicillin-resistant S aureus prevention strategies are justified by associated 
reductions in methicillin-resistant S aureus infections and improvements in 
quality-adjusted life years. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
determined the influence of input variation on the cost-effectiveness.
SETTING: ICU.
PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of adults admitted to the ICU.
INTERVENTIONS: Three prevention strategies were evaluated, including universal 
decolonization, targeted decolonization, and screening and isolation. Because 
prevention strategies have a screening component, the screening test in the 
model was varied to reflect commonly used screening test categories, including 
conventional culture, chromogenic agar, and polymerase chain reaction.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Universal and targeted decolonization are less 
costly and more effective than screening and isolation. This is consistent for 
all screening tests. When compared with targeted decolonization, universal 
decolonization is cost-saving to cost-effective, with maximum cost savings 
occurring when a hospital uses more expensive screening tests like polymerase 
chain reaction. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: As compared with screening and isolation, the current standard 
practice in ICUs, targeted decolonization, and universal decolonization are less 
costly and more effective. This supports updating the standard practice to a 
decolonization approach.

Epidemiology of ageing with HIV: what can we learn from cohorts?

: The last decade has seen a dramatic change in the demographic structure of the 
population of people living with HIV (PLWH). The majority of PLWH who start 
treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy now have good virological and 
immunological responses and this has resulted in improvements in life 
expectancy. In addition, there have also been continued new HIV diagnoses (and 
new HIV infections) in those aged more than 50 years. The average age of those 
attending HIV clinics has therefore increased, with this trend expected to 
continue into the future. As the cohort of PLWH has aged, so the spectrum and 
burden of age-associated noncommunicable comorbidities (AANCCs) in the cohort 
has increased. PLWH are likely, therefore, to have increased healthcare needs 
for the foreseeable future. Although it appears that the average age at 
diagnosis of several AANCC is lower in PLWH, current evidence remains 
insufficient to demonstrate that HIV infection leads to either accelerated or 
accentuated aging. The results from several well designed longitudinal cohorts, 
with appropriately matched control groups, will provide more robust evidence to 
confirm a potential impact of HIV on the incidence of these AANCC. However, 
regardless of the impact of HIV itself, the role of other, non-HIV, factors is 
becoming increasingly important, with coinfection with other viral infections 
and lifestyle factors playing an increasing role in the development of many 
AANCC. It is likely that attempts to reduce smoking prevalence and obesity may 
be associated with important reductions in the incidence of some of these events 
in the future.

Geriatric syndromes: new frontiers in HIV and sarcopenia.

: HIV infection, in many circumstances, can now be managed as a chronic disease 
due to the marked increase in life expectancy since the introduction of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). As the patients who first had access 
to combination ART age into their 50s and 60s, the effects of chronic HIV 
infection on health have become an important research focus in HIV infection. 
People living with HIV appear to exhibit an earlier occurrence of some 
aging-related conditions compared to people without HIV, in part due to higher 
rates of comorbidities, high-risk behaviors (e.g. smoking, substance use), 
chronic immune activation, inflammation, and ART-specific factors. Some studies 
have even suggested an earlier-than-expected appearance of the 'geriatric 
syndromes,' which are complex medical syndromes of older adults that are 
associated with morbidity and mortality. The geriatric syndromes include a wide 
variety of disease processes ranging from incontinence and dementia to 
impairments in physical function. This review will focus on one geriatric 
syndrome, sarcopenia, in older HIV-infected populations, and its relation to 
other aging syndromes, including frailty and falls. The contribution of HIV 
itself, ART exposure, and specific comorbidities, and the importance of early 
recognition and prevention of these aging syndromes will be highlighted.

Vital Signs: Racial Disparities in Age-Specific Mortality Among Blacks or 
African Americans - United States, 1999-2015.

Cunningham TJ, Croft JB, Liu Y, Lu H, Eke PI, Giles WH.

Erratum in
    MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2017 May 12;66(18):490.

BACKGROUND: Although the overall life expectancy at birth has increased for both 
blacks and whites and the gap between these populations has narrowed, 
disparities in life expectancy and the leading causes of death for blacks 
compared with whites in the United States remain substantial. Understanding how 
factors that influence these disparities vary across the life span might enhance 
the targeting of appropriate interventions.
METHODS: Trends during 1999-2015 in mortality rates for the leading causes of 
death were examined by black and white race and age group. Multiple 2014 and 
2015 national data sources were analyzed to compare blacks with whites in 
selected age groups by sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health 
behaviors, health-related quality of life indicators, use of health services, 
and chronic conditions.
RESULTS: During 1999-2015, age-adjusted death rates decreased significantly in 
both populations, with rates declining more sharply among blacks for most 
leading causes of death. Thus, the disparity gap in all-cause mortality rates 
narrowed from 33% in 1999 to 16% in 2015. However, during 2015, blacks still had 
higher death rates than whites for all-cause mortality in all groups aged <65 
years. Compared with whites, blacks in age groups <65 years had higher levels of 
some self-reported risk factors and chronic diseases and mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer, diseases that are most common among persons 
aged ≥65 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: To continue to reduce 
the gap in health disparities, these findings suggest an ongoing need for 
universal and targeted interventions that address the leading causes of deaths 
among blacks (especially cardiovascular disease and cancer and their risk 
factors) across the life span and create equal opportunities for health.

BACKGROUND: In 2008, a study of the characteristics of hospitalised patients led 
to the development of a prognostic tool that distinguished three populations 
with significantly different 2-month survival rates. The goal of our study aimed 
at validating prospectively this prognostic tool in outpatients treated for 
cancer in terminal stage, based on four factors: performance status (ECOG) (PS), 
number of metastatic sites, serum albumin and lactate dehydrogenase.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PRONOPALL is a multicentre study of current care. About 
302 adult patients who met one or more of the following criteria: life 
expectancy under 6 months, performance status ≥ 2 and disease progression during 
the previous chemotherapy regimen were included across 16 institutions between 
October 2009 and October 2010. Afterwards, in order to validate the prognostic 
tool, the score was ciphered and correlated to patient survival.
RESULTS: Totally 262 patients (87%) were evaluable (27 patients excluded and 13 
unknown score). Median age was 66 years [37-88], and women accounted for 59%. 
ECOG PS 0-1 (46%), PS 2 (37%) and PS 3-4 (17%). The primary tumours were: breast 
(29%), colorectal (28%), lung (13%), pancreas (12%), ovary (11%) and other (8%). 
About 32% of patients presented one metastatic site, 35% had two and 31% had 
more than two. The median lactate dehydrogenase level was 398 IU/l [118-4314]; 
median serum albumin was 35 g/l [13-54]. According to the PRONOPALL prognostic 
tool, the 2-month survival rate was 92% and the median survival rate was 301 
days [209-348] for the 130 patients in population C, 66% and 79 days [71-114] 
for the 111 patients in population B, and 24% and 35 days for [14-56] the 21 
patients in population A. These three populations survival were statistically 
different (P <0.0001).
CONCLUSION: PRONOPALL study confirms the three prognostic profiles defined by 
the combination of four factors. This PRONOPALL score is a useful 
decision-making tool in daily practice.

BACKGROUND: Palbociclib (PAL), a novel small-molecule inhibitor of 
cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, 
has demonstrated significant efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival 
when added to existing therapies. Considering the high cost of PAL, we assessed 
cost-effectiveness of adding PAL to usual care in treatment of advanced breast 
cancer.
METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation model to simulate time to 
cancer progression and to compare life time clinical benefit and cost of 
alternative treatment strategies for patients with metastatic disease from 
societal perspective. Per approved indication, endocrine treatment naive 
patients were assigned to PAL plus letrozole (PAL + LET) or letrozole alone 
(LET). Patients with prior endocrine therapy were assigned to PAL plus 
fulvestrant (FUL) (PAL + FUL) or FUL alone. The model assumptions were informed 
based on published clinical trial data and other peer reviewed studies. We 
carried out one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the 
robustness of our results to the changes in model assumptions.
RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, the addition of PAL to LET cost an 
estimated $768 498 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The 
addition of PAL to FUL in patients with prior endocrine therapy cost an 
estimated $918 166 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated adding PAL 
has a 0% chance of being cost-effectiveness in either patient groups at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, PAL treatment of both patient groups 
(with and without prior endocrine therapy) is highly unlikely to be 
cost-effective compared with the usual care in the USA.

BACKGROUND: Cancer anorexia-cachexia is a debilitating condition frequently 
observed in NSCLC patients, characterized by decreased body weight, reduced food 
intake, and impaired quality of life. Anamorelin, a novel selective ghrelin 
receptor agonist, has anabolic and appetite-enhancing activities.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: ROMANA 3 was a safety extension study of two phase 3, 
double-blind studies that assessed safety and efficacy of anamorelin in advanced 
NSCLC patients with cachexia. Patients with preserved Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group ≤2 after completing 12 weeks (w) on the ROMANA 1 or ROMANA 2 
trials (0-12 weeks) could enroll in ROMANA 3 and continue to receive anamorelin 
100 mg or placebo once daily for an additional 12w (12-24 weeks). The primary 
endpoint of ROMANA 3 was anamorelin safety/tolerability (12-24 weeks). Secondary 
endpoints included changes in body weight, handgrip strength (HGS), and symptom 
burden (0-24 weeks).
RESULTS: Of the 703 patients who completed ROMANA 1 and ROMANA 2, 513 patients 
entered ROMANA 3 (anamorelin, N = 345, mean age 62.0 years; placebo, N = 168; 
mean age 62.2 years). During ROMANA 3, anamorelin and placebo groups had similar 
incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 52.2% versus 55.7%), 
grade ≥3 TEAEs (22.4% versus 21.6%), and serious TEAEs (12.8% versus 12.6%). 
There were 36 (10.5%) and 23 (13.8%) deaths in the anamorelin and placebo 
groups, respectively; none were drug-related. Improvements in body weight and 
anorexia-cachexia symptoms observed in the original trials were consistently 
maintained over 12-24 weeks. Anamorelin, versus placebo, significantly increased 
body weight from baseline of original trials at all time points (P < 0.0001) and 
improved anorexia-cachexia symptoms at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 16 (P < 0.05). No 
significant improvement in HGS was seen in either group.
CONCLUSION: During the 12-24 weeks ROMANA 3 trial, anamorelin continued to be 
well tolerated. Over the entire 0-24w treatment period, body weight and symptom 
burden were improved with anamorelin.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: ROMANA 1 (NCT01387269), ROMANA 2 
(NCT01387282), and ROMANA 3 (NCT01395914).

Advances in medicine and progressive improvements in the health of the general 
population in developed countries have led to considerable increases in life 
expectancy over recent years. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects approximately 
25% of the adult population and its prevalence is increasing all over the world. 
Central obesity plays an important role in emergence of MetS. Some studies have 
suggested that there may be link between low Total Testosterone levels and 
emergence of MetS. The objective of this review is to analyze the complex 
network of interactions between MetS and low testosterone levels in elderly men, 
considering etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects. Recent evidence 
confirms that central obesity is the independent MetS component correlated to 
Total Testosterone Levels. Experimental studies suggest a two way road between 
Low Testosterone Levels and abdominal obesity. Besides that, Testosterone 
Replacement Therapy should be restricted to men with biochemical and clinical 
features of late onset hypogonadism.

Obesity-associated comorbidities greatly impact the quality and expectancy of 
life. Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder and it 
is an important risk factor for obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). For these 
reasons, we aimed to assess the effect of an interdisciplinary therapy on the 
symptoms of BED and the prevalence of MetS in obese adults. It was hypothesized 
that the interdisciplinary therapy would decrease symptoms of BED and markers of 
MetS. Twenty-four volunteers (BMI 34.80±3.17 kg/m2; 41.21±6.28 years old) 
completed a 32-week intervention. Biochemical characteristics, body composition, 
the degree of symptoms of binge eating, and macronutrients, and sodium 
consumption pre- and post-treatment were determined. The prevalence of MetS 
dropped from 75% to 45.8%, post-therapy. Among the markers of MetS, waist 
circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly, whereas 
high-density lipoprotein levels increased. Fasting plasma glucose, diastolic 
blood pressure, and triglycerides did not change. Based on binge-eating scale 
(BES) scores, before therapy, 33.3% of volunteers were classified as moderate 
bingers, and after therapy all volunteers were classified as having no BED 
symptoms. No difference in the prevalence of MetS between individuals classified 
as normal or moderate bingers was observed, but we found a positive post-therapy 
correlation between the BES score and body fat, gynoid fat and trunk fat. 
Sodium, fat, and carbohydrate consumption decreased. Protein intake did not 
change. In conclusion, the interdisciplinary approach was efficient in reducing 
symptoms of BED and MetS prevalence in this population.

Kennedy's disease, also known as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a 
rare, adult-onset, X-linked recessive neuromuscular disease caused by expansion 
of a CAG repeat sequence in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene (AR) encoding a 
polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. The polyQ-expanded AR accumulates in nuclei, and 
initiates degeneration and loss of motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia. While 
the disease has long been considered a pure lower motor neuron disease, 
recently, the presence of major hyper-creatine-kinase (CK)-emia and myopathic 
alterations on muscle biopsy has suggested the presence of a primary myopathy 
underlying a wide range of clinical manifestations. The disease, which affects 
male adults, is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy localized 
proximally in the limbs, and bulbar involvement. Sensory disturbances are 
associated with the motor phenotype, but may be subclinical. The most frequent 
systemic symptom is gynecomastia related to androgen insensitivity, but other 
abnormalities, such as heart rhythm and urinary disturbances, have also been 
reported. The course of the disease is slowly progressive with normal life 
expectancy. The diagnosis of SBMA is based on genetic testing, with 38 CAG 
repeats taken as pathogenic. Despite several therapeutic attempts made in mouse 
models, no effective disease-modifying therapy is yet available, although 
symptomatic therapy is beneficial for the management of the weakness, fatigue 
and bulbar symptoms.

The genus Pestivirus within Flaviviridae is comprised of four recognized 
species, namely, bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea 
virus 2 (BVDV-2), border disease virus (BDV) and classical swine fever virus 
(CSFV). BDV, while primarily infecting sheep and goats, has also been reported 
in cattle and wild animals. Infections of sheep and goats result in economic 
loss due to abortions and the birth of persistently infected animals that have 
poor production and reduced life expectancy. In this study, we report the 
detection of BDV in cattle serum collected as part of pestivirus surveillance 
programme from six regions of Mexico, where a 67.1% of BVDV seroprevalence was 
calculated previously. Phylogenetic analyses based on comparison of the 5'UTR 
region typed the Mexican strains as BDV-1. Border disease (BD) is listed as an 
exotic disease in Mexico, and the origin of BDV found in these cattle is 
unclear. This is the first identification of BDV in Mexican cattle.

BACKGROUND: The inclusion of naloxone with oxycodone in a fixed combination 
prolonged-release formulation (OXN PR) improves bowel function compared with 
oxycodone (Oxy) alone without compromising analgesic efficacy. In a recent 
5-week, randomized, double-blind comparative trial of OXN PR and OxyPR, it could 
be shown that the beneficial properties of OXN PR extend to doses up to 
160/80 mg.
METHODS: Bowel function, pain, quality of life (QoL) and safety of OXN PR up to 
180/90 mg daily were evaluated in a 24-week open-label extension phase of the 
5-week randomized comparative study in patients with non-malignant or malignant 
pain requiring opioids and suffering from opioid-induced constipation.
RESULTS: During treatment with a mean (SD) daily dose OXN PR of 130.7 (26.56) mg 
(median, maximum: 120 and 180 mg), the Bowel Function Index (BFI) decreased from 
45.3 (26.37) to 26.7 (21.37) with the largest decrease seen in the first week. 
The average pain over the last 24 h remained stable (median Pain Intensity Scale 
score 4.0) and QoL was maintained throughout the study. Adverse events were 
consistent with the known effects of OXN PR and no new safety concerns emerged. 
Equivalent efficacy and safety benefits were observed in cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The OXN PR in doses up to 180/90 mg provides effective analgesia 
with maintenance of bowel function during long-term treatment. The beneficial 
effects of such dose levels of OXN PR contribute to stable patient-reported QoL 
and health status despite serious underlying pain conditions, such as cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: In patients with pain requiring continuous opioid therapy at doses 
above 80 mg of oxycodone, stable and effective long-term analgesia can be 
achieved using OXN PR up to 180/90 mg daily without compromising bowel function 
and may be preferential to supplemental oxycodone.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant tumor of the central nervous system, 
has a high mortality rate. No curative treatment is presently available, and the 
most commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, the alkylating agent temozolomide 
(TMZ), is only able to increase life expectancy and is often associated with 
drug resistance. Therefore, an urgent need does exist for novel drugs aimed at 
treating gliomas. In the present study, we obtained three major results using 
corilagin: (a) demonstrated that it inhibits the growth of U251 glioma cells 
through activation of the apoptotic pathway; (b) demonstrated that it is also 
active on TMZ-resistant T98G glioma cells; and (c) demonstrated that when used 
in combination with TMZ on T98G glioma cells, a higher level of proapototic and 
antiproliferative effects is observed. Our study indicates that corilagin should 
be investigated in more detail to determine whether it can be developed as a 
potential therapeutic agent. In addition, our results suggest that corilagin 
could be used in combination with low doses of other standard anticancer 
chemotherapeutic drugs against gliomas (such as TMZ) with the aim of obtaining 
enhanced anticancer effects.
