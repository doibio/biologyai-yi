serious somatic disorder, such as a malignant tumor or pneumonia. The risk of 
all-cause mortality on XEPLION was not high in comparison with other 
investigations; the sudden death risk on XEPLION may be higher than on ZODIAC. 
According to many reports from foreign countries, mortality rates associated 
with schizophrenia are two to three times higher than those of the general 
population, corresponding to a 10-25-year reduction in life expectancy. Natural 
deaths account for about 60% of the excess mortality of schizophrenia patients, 
and such patients are more likely to die from ischemic heart disease. Since it 
has been suggested that more than half of sudden deaths in schizophrenic 
patients have a cardiac origin, sudden cardiac deaths are chiefly responsible 
for their reduced life expectancy. This sudden death-related problem of patients 
with schizophrenia has been forgotten or ignored in the psychiatric care of 
Japan. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we should tackle this problem 
seriously, and make an effort to reduce the mortality gap.

Comorbid physical health conditions, commonly associated with mental illness, 
contribute to increased morbidity and reduced life expectancy. The trajectory to 
poorer health begins with the onset of mental illness. For young people with 
mental illness, health risk behaviours and poor physical health can progress to 
adulthood with long-term detrimental impacts. Using a cross-sectional survey 
design, self-reported health risk behaviours were gathered from 56 young 
(16-25Â years) Australians who had been hospitalised for mental illness and 
taking psychotropic medication. Smoking, alcohol use, minimal physical activity, 
and lack of primary health care were evident. While these behaviours are typical 
of many young people, those with mental illness have substantially increased 
vulnerability to poor health and reduced life expectancy. Priority needs to be 
given to targeted health promotion strategies for young people with mental 
illness to modify their risky long-term health behaviours and improve morbidity 
and mortality outcomes. Nurses in mental health settings play a vital role in 
promoting young peoples' well-being and preventing poorer physical health 
outcomes. Implementation of a cardiometabolic health nurse role in inpatient 
settings for young people with mental illness could facilitate prevention and 
early intervention for health risk behaviours.

BACKGROUND: As smoking is the leading preventable cause of multiple diseases and 
premature cancer deaths, estimating the burden of cancer attributable to smoking 
has become the standard in documenting the adverse impact of smoking. In 
Indonesia, there is a dearth of studies assessing the economic costs of cancers 
related to smoking. This study aimed to estimate indirect mortality costs of 
premature cancer deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to 
smoking among the Indonesian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prevalence based method was employed. Using national 
data, we estimated smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 2013. Premature 
mortality costs and YPLL were estimated by calculating number of cancer deaths, 
life expectancy, annual income, and workforce participation rate. A human 
capital approach was used to calculate the present value of lifetime earnings 
(PVLE). A discount rate of 3% was applied.
RESULTS: The study estimated that smoking attributable cancer mortality was 
74,440 (30.6% of total cancer deaths), comprised of 95% deaths in men and 5% in 
women. Cancers attributed to smoking were responsible for 1,207,845 YPLL. Cancer 
mortality costs caused by smoking accounted for USD 1,309 million in 2013. Among 
all cancers, lung cancer is the leading cause of death and economic burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancers related to smoking pose an enormous economic burden in 
Indonesia. Therefore, tobacco control efforts need to be prioritized in order to 
prevent more losses to the nation. The data of this study are important for 
advocating national tobacco control policy.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death throughout the world. Increasing 
life expectancy and aging population are important factors for increasing cancer 
incidences in developing countries. National programs are essential for 
prevention and control of cancer in any society. This study aimed to investigate 
cancer epidemiology and trends in the province of Hamadan, located in Northwest 
Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analytical study was carried out based on cancer 
registry data from 2004 to 2009 in the province of Hamadan, analyzed using STATA 
(version 12) software for descriptive tests and Join point 4.1.1.1 software for 
analytical tests.
RESULTS: There were 7,767 registered cases of cancer during the 6 years studied. 
Of the total cases registered, 59.1% (4,592 cases) involved men and 40.9% (3,175 
cases) occurred in women. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) increased from 
72.9 to 132.0 in males and 48.2 to 115.0 in females during the 6 years of the 
study (p<0.001). The most common cancers were skin, stomach, breast, bladder, 
and leukemia. In women, teh most common were breast, skin, stomach, colorectal, 
and leukemia, in that order, and in men skin, stomach, bladder, leukemia, and 
prostate cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The cancer incidence is greater in men that women in this region 
but with increasing trends in both sexes. Planning regarding education in 
prevention of exposure to risk factors and control strategies is required to 
decrease the incident cases. Screening programs for common cancers in older age 
groups might be helpful to reduce the disease impact.

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, bladder cancer was associated with a 
significant increase. Given the importance of the impact of socioeconomic status 
on the distribution of cancer incidence and mortality, and the need to 
information on these parameters for prevention planning, the aim of this study 
was to evaluate data for bladder cancer and their relationship with human 
development index (HDI) and its components in Asia in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted based on data from the world data 
of cancer and the World Bank (including the HDI and its components). The 
incidence and mortality rates were drawn for Asian countries. To analyze data, 
correlation tests between incidence and death rates, and HDI and its components 
were employed with a significance level of 0.05 using SPSS software.
RESULTS: A total incidence of 696,231 cases (68.7% in males and 31.3% in 
females, sex ratio of 2.19:1) and 524,465 deaths (67.0% in men and 32.9% in 
women, sex ratio was 2.03:1) were recorded in Asian countries in 2012. 
Correlation between HDI and standardized incidence rate was 0.241 overall 
(p=0.106), 0.236 in men (p=0.114) and -0.250 in women (p=0.094). Also between 
HDI and standardized mortality rate 0.025 (p=0.871) in men 0.118 (p=0.903) and 
in women 0.014 (p=0.927).
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder cancer incidence is higher in developed countries, but the 
rate is declining, and in less developed and developing countries it is growing. 
There was no statistically significant correlation between the standardized 
incidence rate of bladder cancer and the HDI and its dimensions in Asia, except 
for the level of education.

Cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental patients with prosthetic 
joints: Comparisons of antibiotic regimens for patients with total hip 
arthroplasty.

    J Am Dent Assoc. 2016 Apr;147(4):230-1.
    J Am Dent Assoc. 2016 Apr;147(4):231.

BACKGROUND: Clinician uncertainty concerning the need for antibiotic prophylaxis 
to prevent prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after undergoing dental procedures 
persists. Improved understanding of the potential clinical and economic risks 
and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis will help inform the debate and 
facilitate the continuing evolution of clinical management guidelines for dental 
patients with prosthetic joints.
METHODS: The authors developed a Markov decision model to compare the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of alternative antibiotic prophylaxis strategies for dental 
patients aged 65 years who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA). On the 
basis of the authors' interpretation of previous recommendations from the 
American Dental Association and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, they 
compared the following strategies: no prophylaxis, prophylaxis for the first 2 
years after arthroplasty, and lifetime prophylaxis.
RESULTS: A strategy of foregoing antibiotic prophylaxis before dental visits was 
cost-effective and resulted in lower lifetime accumulated costs ($11,909) and 
higher accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (12.375) when compared 
with alternative prophylaxis strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of Markov decision modeling indicated that a 
no-antibiotic prophylaxis strategy was cost-effective for dental patients who 
had undergone THA. These results support the findings of case-control studies 
and the conclusions of an American Dental Association Council on Scientific 
Affairs report that questioned general recommendations for antibiotic 
prophylaxis before dental procedures.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results of cost-effectiveness decision modeling 
support the contention that routine antibiotic prophylaxis for dental patients 
with total joint arthroplasty should be reconsidered.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reducing the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver 
disease will require treating people who inject drugs (PWID), the group at most 
risk of infection and transmission. We determine the cost-effectiveness of 
treating PWID with interferon-free direct-acting antiviral therapy in Australia.
METHODS: Using a deterministic model of HCV treatment and liver disease 
progression, including a fixed rate of re-infection, the expected healthcare 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of a cohort of newly HCV-infected 
PWID were calculated for: no treatment; treatment after initial infection 
("early-treatment"); and treatment prior to developing compensated cirrhosis 
("late-treatment"). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to 
compare scenarios.
RESULTS: Late-treatment was cost-effective compared to no treatment, with a 
discounted average gain of 2.98 (95%confidence interval 2.88-5.22) QALYs per 
person for an additional cost of $15,132 ($11,246-18,922), giving an ICER of 
$5078 ($2847-5295) per QALY gained. Compared to late-treatment, early-treatment 
gained a further discounted average of 2.27 (0.58-4.80) QALYs per person for 
$38,794 ($34,789-41,367), giving an ICER of $17,090 ($2847-63,282), which was 
cost-effective in approximately 90% of Monte-Carlo uncertainty simulations. For 
every 100 newly HCV-infected PWID, there were an estimated 40 (39-56) eventual 
liver-related deaths without treatment, compared to 7 (6-11) and 8 (7-13) with 
early-treatment and late-treatment available respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating HCV-infected PWID with new therapies is cost-effective and 
could prevent a significant number of liver-related deaths. Although 
late-treatment was the most cost-effective option, the cost per QALY gained for 
early-treatment compared to late-treatment is likely to be below unofficial 
Australian willingness to pay thresholds.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the expected years lived with 
hearing impairment, vision impairment, and dual sensory impairment among older 
adults.
METHODS: A total of 4,160 adults (45.1% men) from two Australian community based 
studies were followed for up to 16 years (average 8.9 years). Hearing impairment 
was defined by a pure-tone average (500-4000 Hz) greater than 25 dB in the 
better ear. Vision impairment was defined by presenting distance visual acuity 
worse than 6/12 (20/40). Postliminary analyses were also conducted for moderate 
levels of sensory impairment. Dual sensory impairment was defined by concurrent 
hearing and vision impairment. Multistate Markov models were used to calculate 
sensory life expectancies based on transition probabilities between health 
states (no sensory impairment, sensory impairment, and death).
RESULTS: Based on thresholds for mild impairment, men aged 65 had a total life 
expectancy of 19.4 years, and were estimated to live for 10.4 years (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 9.1, 11.7) with hearing impairment, 2.8 years (95% CI: 
2.4, 3.2) with vision impairment, and 2.2 years (95% CI: 1.8, 2.6) with dual 
sensory impairment. Women aged 65 had a total life expectancy of 23.2 years, and 
were estimated to live for 12.9 years (95% CI: 11.9, 13.9) with hearing 
impairment, 3.9 years (95% CI: 3.4, 4.4) with vision impairment, and 3.2 years 
(95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) with dual sensory impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being highly prevalent, hearing and vision 
impairment affect older adults for substantial periods of their remaining life. 
Given their broad ranging impacts on health and well-being, sensory impairments 
are ideal targets for strategies to compress morbidity in late life.

OBJECTIVES: To explore whether the rule of law is a foundational determinant of 
health that underlies other socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that 
have been associated with health outcomes.
SETTING: Global project.
PARTICIPANTS: Data set of 96 countries, comprising 91% of the global population.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The following health indicators, infant 
mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, life expectancy, and cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes mortality rate, were included to explore their association 
with the rule of law. We used a novel Rule of Law Index, gathered from survey 
sources, in a cross-sectional and ecological design. The Index is based on eight 
subindices: (1) Constraints on Government Powers; (2) Absence of Corruption; (3) 
Order and Security; (4) Fundamental Rights; (5) Open Government; (6) Regulatory 
Enforcement, (7) Civil Justice; and (8) Criminal Justice.
RESULTS: The rule of law showed an independent association with infant mortality 
rate, maternal mortality rate, life expectancy, and cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes mortality rate, after adjusting for the countries' level of per capita 
income, their expenditures in health, their level of political and civil 
freedom, their Gini measure of inequality and women's status (p<0.05). Rule of 
law remained significant in all the multivariate models, and the following 
adjustment for potential confounders remained robust for at least one or more of 
the health outcomes across all eight subindices of the rule of law. Findings 
show that the higher the country's level of adherence to the rule of law, the 
better the health of the population.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to start considering the country's adherence to the 
rule of law as a foundational determinant of health. Health advocates should 
consider the improvement of rule of law as a tool to improve population health. 
Conversely, lack of progress in rule of law may constitute a structural barrier 
to health improvement.

Application of iChip to Grow "Uncultivable" Microorganisms and its Impact on 
Antibiotic Discovery.

Antibiotics have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing significant progress 
in healthcare and improvement in life expectancy. Development of antibiotic 
resistance by pathogenic bacteria is a natural phenomenon; however, the rate of 
antibiotic resistance emergence is increasing at an alarming rate, due to 
indiscriminate use of antibiotics in healthcare, agriculture and even everyday 
products. Traditionally, antibiotic discovery has been conducted by screening 
extracts of microorganisms for antimicrobial activity. However, this 
conventional source has been over-used to such an extent that it poses the risk 
of "running out" of new antibiotics. Aiming to increase access to a greater 
diversity of microorganisms, a new cultivation method with an in situ approach 
called iChip has been designed. The iChip has already isolated many novel 
organisms, as well as Teixobactin, a novel antibiotic with significant potency 
against gram-positive bacteria.

Rhizobial infection of legume root hairs requires a rearrangement of the actin 
cytoskeleton to enable the establishment of plant-made infection structures 
called infection threads. In the SCAR/WAVE (Suppressor of cAMP receptor 
defect/WASP family verpolin homologous protein) actin regulatory complex, the 
conserved N-terminal domains of SCAR proteins interact with other components of 
the SCAR/WAVE complex. The conserved C-terminal domains of SCAR proteins bind to 
and activate the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, which can bind to 
actin filaments catalyzing new actin filament formation by nucleating actin 
branching. We have identified, SCARN (SCAR-Nodulation), a gene required for root 
hair infection of Lotus japonicus by Mesorhizobium loti. Although the SCARN 
protein is related to Arabidopsis thaliana SCAR2 and SCAR4, it belongs to a 
distinct legume-sub clade. We identified other SCARN-like proteins in legumes 
and phylogeny analyses suggested that SCARN may have arisen from a gene 
duplication and acquired specialized functions in root nodule symbiosis. 
Mutation of SCARN reduced formation of infection-threads and their extension 
into the root cortex and slightly reduced root-hair length. Surprisingly two of 
the scarn mutants showed constitutive branching of root hairs in uninoculated 
plants. However we observed no effect of scarn mutations on trichome development 
or on the early actin cytoskeletal accumulation that is normally seen in root 
hair tips shortly after M. loti inoculation, distinguishing them from other 
symbiosis mutations affecting actin nucleation. The C-terminal domain of SCARN 
binds to ARPC3 and ectopic expression of the N-terminal SCAR-homology domain 
(but not the full length protein) inhibited nodulation. In addition, we found 
that SCARN expression is enhanced by M. loti in epidermal cells and that this is 
directly regulated by the NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) transcription factor.

Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA. kaneville@uams.edu.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a potentially devastating and life threatening 
condition that is caused by an autosomal recessive inherited hemoglobinopathy 
which results in vaso-occlusive phenomena and hemolysis. The severity of this 
disorder is widely variable, but overall mortality is increased and life 
expectancy decreased when compared to the general population. Care of patients 
with sickle cell disease is largely supportive. In fact, hydroxyurea is the only 
drug used that modifies disease pathogenesis. Painful vaso-occlusive events are 
the most common complication experienced by both children and adults with sickle 
cell disease and hydroxyurea is the only treatment option available to prevent 
the development of these events. Most events are managed with traditional 
supportive care measures (i.e. aggressive hydration, antiinflammatory and 
narcotic analgesics) that have not changed in decades. As such, there is an 
overwhelming need for both the development of new agents and new approaches to 
treatment with existing modalities for patients with sickle cell disease.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness assessment of lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone (Rd) vs bortezomib plus melphalan and prednisone (VMP) as initial 
treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with newly-diagnosed multiple 
myeloma (MM), from a U.S. payer perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to estimate expected 
life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), direct costs and incremental 
costs per QALY and LY gained associated with use of Rd vs VMP over a patient's 
lifetime. Information on the efficacy and safety of Rd and VMP was based on data 
from multinational phase III clinical trials and a network meta-analysis. 
Pre-progression direct costs included the costs of Rd and VMP, treatment of 
adverse events (including prophylaxis) and routine care and monitoring 
associated with MM. Post-progression direct costs included costs of subsequent 
treatment(s) and routine care and monitoring for progressive disease, all 
obtained from published literature and estimated from a U.S. payer perspective. 
Utilities were obtained from the aforementioned trials. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: Relative to VMP, use of Rd was expected to result in an additional 2.22 
LYs and 1.47 QALYs (discounted). Patients initiated with Rd were expected to 
incur an additional $78,977 in mean lifetime direct costs (discounted) vs those 
initiated with VMP. The incremental costs per QALY and per LY gained with Rd vs 
VMP were $53,826 and $35,552, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, results 
were found to be most sensitive to differences in survival associated with Rd vs 
VMP, the cost of lenalidomide and the discount rate applied to effectiveness 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Rd was expected to result in greater LYs and QALYs compared with 
VMP, with similar overall costs per LY for each regimen. Results of this 
analysis indicated that Rd may be a cost-effective alternative to VMP as initial 
treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with MM, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio well within the levels for recent advancements in 
oncology.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of ofatumumab 
plus chlorambucil (OChl) versus chlorambucil in patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia for whom fludarabine-based therapies are considered 
inappropriate from the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system in 
Canada.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model (3-month cycle length) used survival curves to 
govern progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Efficacy and 
safety data and health-state utility values were estimated from the COMPLEMENT-1 
trial. Post-progression treatment patterns were based on clinical guidelines, 
Canadian treatment practices and published literature. Total and incremental 
expected lifetime costs (in Canadian dollars [$Can], year 2013 values), 
life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed. Uncertainty 
was assessed via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The discounted lifetime health and economic outcomes estimated by the 
model showed that, compared with chlorambucil, first-line treatment with OChl 
led to an increase in QALYs (0.41) and total costs ($Can27,866) and to an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $Can68,647 per QALY gained. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the modelling 
time horizon and to the extrapolation of OS treatment effects beyond the trial 
duration. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost 
effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can100,000 per QALY gained 
was 59Â %.
CONCLUSIONS: Base-case results indicated that improved overall response and PFS 
for OChl compared with chlorambucil translated to improved quality-adjusted life 
expectancy. Sensitivity analysis suggested that OChl is likely to be cost 
effective subject to uncertainty associated with the presence of any long-term 
OS benefit and the model time horizon.

OBJECTIVE: Observations over the past few years have demonstrated the need to 
adjust glycemic targets based on parameters pertaining to individual patient 
characteristics and comorbidities. However, the weight and value given to each 
parameter will clearly vary depending on the experience of the provider, the 
characteristics of the patient, and the specific clinical situation.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine if there is current consensus on a 
global level with regard to identifying these parameters and their relative 
importance, we conducted a survey among 244 key worldwide opinion-leading 
diabetologists. Initially, the physicians were to rank the factors they take 
into consideration when setting their patients' glycemic target according to 
their relative importance. Subsequently, six clinical vignettes were presented, 
and the experts were requested to suggest an appropriate glycemic target. The 
survey results were used to formulate an algorithm according to which an 
estimate of the patient's glycemic target based on individualized parameters can 
be computed. Three additional clinical cases were submitted to a new set of 
experts for validation of the algorithm.
RESULTS: A total of 151 (61.9%) experts responded to the survey. The parameters 
"life expectancy" and "risk of hypoglycemia from treatment" were considered to 
be the most important. "Resources" and "disease duration" ranked the lowest. An 
algorithm was constructed based on survey results. It was validated by 
presenting three new cases to 57 leading diabetologists who suggested glycemic 
targets that were similar to those calculated by the algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: The resultant suggested algorithm is an additional decision-making 
tool offered to the clinician to supplement clinical decision making when 
considering a glycemic target for the individual patient with diabetes.

Tea (Camellia sinensis) is rich in flavan-3-ols (catechins), especially 
epicatechin (EC), which is the predominant extension unit of polymeric 
proanthocyanidins (PAs). However, studies assessing EC's stereochemistry are 
scarce. Here, a high performance liquid chromatography column using amylose 
tris-(3, 5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) immobilized on silica-gel as chiral 
stationary phases (CSPs) was applied to explore its stereochemistry and 
biosynthetic pathway in tea plants. The results revealed (-)-epicatechin 
[(-)-EC] was the predominant di-hyroxy-non-galloylated-catechins, while 
(+)-epicatechin [(+)-EC] was not detected. Interestingly, (-)-EC was the only 
product obtained from cyanidin using the partially purified native C. sinensis 
anthocyanidin reductase (CsANR) in the presence of reduction nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH); meanwhile, (+)-EC was the main product 
using recombinant CsANR in the same conditions. In addition, (-)-EC could be 
obtained from (+)-catechin [(+)-C] using recombinant CsANR, which displayed 
C3-epimerase activity in the presence of oxidation nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)). But the partially purified native CsANR did 
not possess this function. Finally, (-)-EC could result from the de-gallate acid 
reaction of epicatechin gallate (ECG) catalyzed by a novel partially purified 
native galloylated catechins hydrolase (GCH) from tea leaves. In summary, (-)-EC 
is likely the product of native protein from the tea plants, and (+)-EC is only 
produced in a reaction catalyzed by recombinant CsANR in vitro.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing life expectancy has resulted in a larger population of 
older individuals at risk of dementia.
METHODS: The Cardiovascular Health Study-Cognition Study followed 532 
participants from 1998-99 (mean age 79) to 2013 (mean age 93) for death and 
dementia.
RESULTS: Risk of death was determined by extent of coronary artery calcium, 
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, and white matter 
grade. Significant predictors of dementia were age, apolipoprotein-E4, 
vocabulary raw score, hippocampal volume, ventricular size, cognitive 
performance, and number of blocks walked. By 2013, 160 of 532 were alive, 
including 19 cognitively normal. Those with normal cognition had higher grade 
education, better cognition test scores, greater hippocampal volume, faster gait 
speed, and number of blocks walked as compared with survivors who were demented.
DISCUSSION: Few survived free of dementia and disability. Prevention and delay 
of cognitive decline for this older population is an imperative.

Process of demographic ageing, especially in recent decades, is steadily growing 
in dynamics and importance due to increasing health-related needs and 
expectations with regard to a guarantee of social services. Elaboration of the 
most effective model of care, tailored to Polish conditions, requires an 
estimation of actual costs of this care, including indirect costs which are 
greatly related to informal care. The fact that the costs of informal care are 
omitted, results from a determined approach to analyses. It is discussed only 
from a perspective of budget for health and does not cover societal aspects. In 
such situation, however, the costs borne by a receiver of services are 
neglected. As a consequence, the costs of informal care are underestimated or 
often excluded from calculations, even if they include indirect costs. 
Comprehensive methodological approach for estimating the costs of informal care 
seems to be important for a properly conducted economic evaluation in health 
care sector.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the tools of therapeutic decision that push towards 
surgical treatment in non metastatic prostate cancer eligible to local 
treatment. The optimized assessment of the disease and eventual comorbidities 
improves the selection of patients. Patient's files will be presented in the 
uro-oncological multidisciplinary discussions to validate the customized 
therapeutic approach proposed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review using Medline (National library of 
medicine, Pubmed) and Med Science databases based on the scientific pertinence. 
Research was focused on the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the evaluation of the 
disease and patient's characteristics, and finally the elements that are with a 
surgical treatment (past medical history, past surgical history, functional 
status, patient's comorbidities, and life expectancy).
RESULTS: The pretherapeutic oncologic evaluation allows to estimate the risks 
associated with prostate cancer; it is an essential aspect of therapeutic 
decision. Several clinical, biological, imaging and pathological criteria allow 
to guide decision-making according to tumor aggressiveness and risk of 
recurrence, estimating the results of the different treatments proposed. On the 
other hand, the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary continence 
and sexual function, the integration of anatomical data, past medical and past 
surgical history are all essential for the therapeutic decision, in addition to 
the comorbidities (Charlson, ASA, ICD). These elements should be taken all 
together in order to decide for a radical or conservative management of PCa, 
they guide decision-making in patients candidate for surgery. For example, age 
plays a key role in the choice of treatment, even in older men at risk of 
developing high-risk PCa that can affect overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The combined evaluation of the patient and disease characteristics 
is of utmost importance in oncology, and especially in the treatment of 
non-metastatic PCa. The role of the anesthesiologist in the analysis and 
interpretation of comorbidities remains primordial and it is essential for the 
selection of the right candidates for surgery after being well informed, and 
orienting them toward surgery in agreement with the prerogatives programs of 
customized care.

We systematically quantified excess mortality in epilepsy patients by cause of 
death using the population-attributable fraction and epilepsy-attributable years 
of potential life lost (YPLL) by age 75Â years at ages 15 and over. We updated 
and undertook a re-review of mortality studies from our previous systematic 
review following PRISMA guidelines to identify cohort studies of general 
epilepsy populations reporting a relative risk (RR) of death by cause relative 
to the background rates in the population. Studies on epilepsy prevalence were 
identified through published reviews. Country-specific mortality figures were 
obtained from the WHO World Mortality Database. We performed a pooled analysis 
with the DerSimonian-Laird random effects method. In countries with very high 
Human Development Indices, epilepsy contributed to 0.5-1.1Â % of all deaths in 
the total population. Among external causes, suicides (RR 2.9, 95Â % confidence 
interval 2.2-3.8; I(2) 52Â %) were the major contributor to YPLL, corresponding 
to 6.7Â % and 4.2Â % of excess YPLL due to epilepsy in the United States (US) and 
in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2010, with 541 (346-792) and 44 (28-65) excess 
suicide cases, respectively. Fatal accidental falls were more common, with 813 
(610-1064) and 95 (71-125) excess deaths in the US and in the UK, but these 
caused only 2.0Â % of excess YPLL as they occurred in older age groups. Suicides 
were the most important external cause of death in epilepsy patients in terms of 
excess YPLL, whereas other external causes were either more common in older ages 
or caused less excess deaths.

Over the last half century, the life expectancy for persons with spinal cord 
injury has increased drastically. Associated with the increased life expectancy, 
renal, metabolic and respiratory complications have given way to cardiovascular 
disease as the leading cause of death. Therefore, it is imperative that 
clinicians have at their disposal non-invasive and practical techniques for 
tracking cardiovascular disease risk amongst individual patients. This review 
provides an overview of non-invasive, widely available, and relatively 
inexpensive technologies for assessing cardiovascular health in persons with 
spinal cord injury. These technologies include ultrasound, pulse wave velocity 
and pulse wave analysis. A number of assessments can be conducted using these 
technologies, which confer acceptable reliability and validity, and are 
relatively simple to administer. Assessment recommendations for use in clinical 
practice are provided, and there is sufficient evidence to encourage the use of 
these techniques as a component of routine serial assessments.

[A MODEL OF COMPREHENSIVE CARE FOR COMPLEX CHRONIC PATIENT. EXPERIENCE OF A 
TERRITORY].

[Article in Spanish]

Torres M, Fabrellas N, SolÃ  M, Rubio MerchÃ¡n A, CamaÃ±es Garcia N, Berlanga S.

The Increase in life expectancy has brought an increase in chronic diseases. The 
evolution of chronic disease is the cause of several organic and systemic 
dysfunctions, leading to physical and mental limitations that determine the need 
for some aid to perform basic vital tasks. Primary health care has a key role in 
the monitoring of fragility, chronicity, and complexity of population. However, 
in order to address properly high complexity diseases it is necessary to know 
and coordinate the different resources existing inside the territory. THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODEL FOR ACTION: THE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF A FUNCTIONAL UNIT. 
The Primary Health Care must ensure equity, accessibility, longitudinally, and 
continuity of care, bearing in mind that health outcomes must be optimal. There 
are several health care providers in the Delta del Llobregat SAP, so it was 
implemented a strategic plan focused on the coordination and/or the 
reconciliation of all the devices involved in the assistance in order to provide 
comprehensive attention to the patient. The patients included in this program 
were to be identified as CCP (Complex chronic Patient), in an evolved and 
tributary phase of intensive follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. The identification 
ofpatients listed as CCP and at clinical risk allows a comprehensive monitoring 
in order to prevent exacerbations and overuse of unscheduled hospital resources.
