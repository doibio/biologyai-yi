BACKGROUND: Avoidable mortality is considered as a potential indicator of the 
influences of public health policies and healthcare quality on population 
health. This study aimed to examine the trend in avoidable mortality and its 
influence on rising life expectancy (LE) and declining gender gap in LE (GGLE) 
in Sweden.
METHODS: We extracted data on causes of death by age, sex, and year from 
national registry from 1997 to 2018. The UK Office for National Statistics 
definition was used to divide causes of death into five mutually exclusive 
categories: amenable, preventable, amenable & preventable, ischemic heart 
disease (IHD), and non-avoidable causes. We applied Joinpoint regression to 
analyse temporal trends in age-standardized mortality rates. The Arriaga method 
was applied to decompose changes in LE and GGLE by age group and causes of 
death.
RESULTS: Average annual reductions in avoidable vs. non-avoidable mortality were 
2.6% (95% CI:2.5, 2.7) vs. 1.4% (95% CI:1.3, 1.5) in men, and 1.6% (95% CI:1.4, 
1.9) vs. 0.9% (95% CI:0.7, 1.0) in women over the study period. LE in men rose 
by 4.1 years between 1997 and 2018 (from 72.8 to 76.9 years), of which 2.4 years 
(59.3%) were attributable to reductions in avoidable mortality. Corresponding LE 
gain was 2.3 years in women (from 78.0 in 1997 to 80.3 in 2018) and avoidable 
mortality accounted for 1.0 year (45.6%) of this gain. Between 1997 and 2018, 
the GGLE narrowed by 1.9 years, of which 1.4 years (77.7%) were attributable to 
avoidable causes. Among avoidable causes, while preventable causes had the 
largest contribution to the GGLE, IHD had the greatest contributions to LE gains 
and the narrowing GGLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that avoidable causes had a substantial 
contribution to gain in LE with more profound gain in men than in women, 
resulting in narrowing the GGLE. Lower pace of reductions in preventable than 
amenable mortality highlights the need for improving the effectiveness of 
inter-sectoral health policies aimed at behavioural changes.

PURPOSE: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder in which several 
systems are affected with great phenotypic variability. Although known to be 
associated with pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, few genotype-phenotype 
correlations have been found in proband studies only.
METHODS: In 1,575 consecutive MFS probands and relatives from the most 
comprehensive database worldwide, we established survival curves and sought 
genotype-phenotype correlations.
RESULTS: A risk chart could be established with clinical and genetic data. 
Premature termination codon variants were not only associated with a shorter 
life expectancy and a high lifelong risk of aortic event, but also with the 
highest risk of severe scoliosis and a lower risk for ectopia lentis (EL) 
surgery. In-frame variants could be subdivided according to their impact on the 
cysteine content of fibrillin-1 with a global higher severity for cysteine loss 
variants and the highest frequency of EL surgery for cysteine addition variants.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that FBN1 genotype-phenotype correlations exist for 
both aortic and extra-aortic features. It can be used for optimal risk 
stratification of patients with a great importance for genetic counseling and 
personalized medicine. This also provides additional data for the overall 
understanding of the role of fibrillin-1 in various organs.

Here we present an annotation of speech in the audio-visual movie "Forrest Gump" 
and its audio-description for a visually impaired audience, as an addition to a 
large public functional brain imaging dataset ( studyforrest.org). The 
annotation provides information about the exact timing of each of the more than 
2500 spoken sentences, 16,000 words (including 202 non-speech vocalizations), 
66,000 phonemes, and their corresponding speaker. Additionally, for every word, 
we provide lemmatization, a simple part-of-speech-tagging (15 grammatical 
categories), a detailed part-of-speech tagging (43 grammatical categories), 
syntactic dependencies, and a semantic analysis based on word embedding which 
represents each word in a 300-dimensional semantic space. To validate the 
dataset's quality, we build a model of hemodynamic brain activity based on 
information drawn from the annotation. Results suggest that the annotation's 
content and quality enable independent researchers to create models of brain 
activity correlating with a variety of linguistic aspects under conditions of 
near-real-life complexity.

Changes in color, browning indices, enzyme activity, and physical and chemical 
quality during the storage period were investigated to assess the effectiveness 
of storage period extension along with the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) and 
citric acid (CA) to salted Chinese cabbage. After 16 days of storage, the change 
in chromaticity value showed treatment with 0.5% CA showed the lowest change in 
the brown index during the storage period. The control showed the highest 
residual activity of polyphenol oxidase among control, AA, and CA-treated salted 
cabbage. AA and CA treatment effectively inhibited the initial populations of 
microorganisms including total aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeast 
and molds in salted Chinese cabbage during storage. Further, the texture, i.e., 
hardness, chewability, and elasticity, tended to decrease with increasing 
storage. These results suggest that treatment with AA could help maintain the 
quality of salted Chinese cabbage during the storage period.

Background: The population is aging much faster in China than other low- and 
middle-income countries. With the accelerated aging of the population, incidence 
and disease burden of age-related diseases have also continued to increase. 
Exploring the burden of age-related diseases is crucial for early disease 
prevention, assessing the extent of population aging, and achieving the goal of 
healthy aging. Methods: We used the dataset from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), and selected data on incidence, 
prevalence, and disease burden in China, in 1997, 2007, and 2017. We classified 
age-related diseases, which were defined as diseases in which the incidence rate 
increased quadratically with age in the adult population. Additionally, we 
described the changes in age-related diseases during the study period by 
different GBD categories. It also measured changes in the age-related disease 
burden in our study period, including disability-adjusted life years (DALY), 
years of life lost (YLL), and years lived with disability (YLD). Finally, we 
compared the differences in the age-related disease burdens for men and women. 
Results: Among the 293 diseases listed in the GBD study, 69 in 2017, 78 in 1997 
and 72 in 2007 were identified as age-related diseases. More than half of the 
age-related diseases belonged to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in our study 
period. The rate of age-standardized age-related disease burden decreased 
between 1997 and 2017. DALYs decreased by 24.89% for non-age-related diseases 
and by 50.15% in age-related diseases from 1997 to 2017. The age-related disease 
burden of men was higher than that of women; we found a decreasing trend, with 
-46.23% in men and -54.90% in women. Conclusions: Comparing characteristics of 
the aging population in China and the world, we found that China does not have 
the typical disease characteristics of aging society. Currently, China faces the 
dual threat of NCDs and communicable diseases, and NCDs account for the vast 
majority of the age-related disease burden. Our health systems should focus on 
disease prevention and early detection among the entire population, instead of 
treatment. Further studies should focus on reducing the duration and severity of 
morbidity in later life.

The question of whether rising life expectancy has led to additional life years 
spent in good health or poor health is of major public health relevance. We 
tested the theories of compression or expansion of morbidity for Germany with 
respect to the mental and physical component summary scales (MCS/PCS) of the 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire (SF-12). Data of 90,758 
women and 81,400 men were obtained from the German Socio-Economic Panel between 
2002 and 2018. Linear and logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate 
temporal changes in MCS and PCS in different life stages. The development of 
healthy life expectancy (H-LE) expressed by life years without severe functional 
limitations was calculated by applying the Sullivan method. Overall, a 
significant increase of MCS and PCS was found in both genders. The rise was 
mainly due to declining proportions of severe limitations (norm values < 40 
points) while the proportions of norm values > 60 points did not change 
substantially. Improvements were most apparent for the 'young seniors' (65-79 
years) and at 'old age' (80 years +). In contrast, no improvements in PCS were 
found for 'later working life' (50-64 years) and decreasing levels were observed 
for persons of 'middle working age' (30-49 years). During the study period, H-LE 
at age 50 increased in women/men by 2.93/2.90 years (MCS) and 1.92/2.53 years 
(PCS), respectively. Our results support the hypothesis of absolute compression 
of morbidity. However, since consistent improvements were not found for ages 
below 65 years, it remains open to debate whether the positive health trend will 
also persist in the future. Our findings suggest that health promotion efforts 
should be strengthened for people of middle and later working age to support 
healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: Since the end of the industrial revolution, advances in public 
health and clinical medicine have contributed to dramatic decreases in infant 
and childhood mortality, improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
increases in overall life expectancy (LE), and rectangularization of survival 
curves.
OBJECTIVES: In this article, we focus on disability that has occurred with the 
overall lengthening of LE in many populations and the implications this has for 
decreased HRQoL.
METHODS: We utilize the concept of rectangularization of population survival to 
depict the rising prevalence of disability associated with increased LE, 
especially among racial and ethnic minorities and people of low socioeconomic 
status (SES) and relate this to HRQoL.
RESULTS: Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and healthy life expectancy 
(HLE) are defined in terms of HRQoL. Specific attention is focused on disability 
experienced by disparate populations around the globe. By focusing on 
disparities in DFLE, and the need to expand LE to include HLE as a central 
component of HRQoL, this work provides an important counterpoint to the 
attention that has been paid to LE disparities according to race, gender, 
ethnicity, education, and SES.
DISCUSSION: By calling attention to those factors that appear to be the most 
important drivers of the differences in quality and length of DFLE between 
different groups (i.e., the components of the social gradient, exposure to 
chronic stress, systemic inflammation, and the psychological and biological 
mechanisms associated with the gut-brain axis) and, by logical extension, HRQoL, 
we hope to promote research in this arena with the ultimate goal of improving 
DFLE, HLE, and overall HRQoL, especially in disparate populations around the 
globe.

Increasing fertility and decreasing mortality are major response strategies in 
Russian demographic reform, which has led to significant decreases in both 
abortion rate (AR) and infant mortality. This study explores mechanisms 
influencing the socioeconomic conditions leading to abortion and infant 
mortality. Spatial panel economic analysis using data from the 83 regions of the 
country covering four time periods was applied. Every 1000 USD increase in per 
capita gross regional product (GRP) can lead to a decrease of the AR by 0.075, 
while one year life expectancy increase would lower it by 0.441. For infant 
mortality rate (IMR), GRP also shows a positive impact, particularly in recent 
years, while the population size of the region has a negative impact. Every 1000 
USD increase in per capita GRP would result in a rate decrease of 0.064 in IMR, 
and every increase of 1000 added population would lead to an increased IMR by 
2.05. The harvest effect between AR and infant mortality that was evident 
earlier, but not in the recent years, implies that the health care system in 
Russia is effective. A comprehensive improvement in wellbeing, income, etc. can 
contribute to mitigation of abortion and infant mortality. Theoretically, this 
study extends current research by comprehensively displaying the spatio-temporal 
patterns of abortion and infant mortality in Russia and qualifies the impact of 
regional socioeconomic disparities with regard to these two issues.

BACKGROUND: Crouch gait is a frequent gait abnormality observed in children with 
cerebral palsy. Distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) with the tightening of 
the extensor mechanism is a common treatment strategy to address the pathologic 
knee flexion contracture and patella alta. The goal of this study was to review 
the results of a patellar tendon imbrication (PTI) strategy to address 
quadriceps insufficiency in the setting of children undergoing DFEO.
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, all patients with crouch 
gait treated at a single institution with DFEO and PTI were identified. 
Clinical, radiographic, and instrumented gait analysis data were analyzed 
preoperatively and at 1 year following surgery.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (54 extremities) with a diagnosis of cerebral 
palsy and crouch gait were included. Significant improvements were appreciated 
in the degree of knee flexion contracture, quadriceps strength, knee extensor 
lag, and popliteal angle (P<0.01). Knee flexion at initial contact and during 
mid-stance improved significantly (P<0.0001), and knee moments in late stance 
were significantly reduced (P<0.01). The anterior pelvic tilt, however, 
significantly increased postoperatively (P<0.0001). Radiographic improvements 
were seen in the knee flexion angle and patellar station as assessed by the 
Koshino Sugimoto Index (P<0.0001). Four patients (14.2%) developed a recurrence 
of knee flexion contracture requiring further intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: PTI is a simplified and safe technique to address quadriceps 
insufficiency when performing DFEO. The short-term results of patients who 
underwent DFEO with PTI demonstrated improvements in clinical, radiographic, and 
gait analysis variables of the knee. Investigating long-term outcomes, comparing 
techniques, and assessing quality of life measures are important next steps in 
research.

[Personalised follow-ups for patients curatively treated for squamous cell 
carcinoma in the oral cavity].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Brands MT, Verbeek ALM, Geurts SME, Merkx MAW.

As a result of an increase in the incidence of oral cancer and improving 
survival rates, the number of patients needing follow-up care will increase in 
the Netherlands. At present, these patients enroll in a 5-year follow-up 
programme aiming for early detection of recurrences or second primary tumors and 
improving their prognosis of life expectancy, among other things. Recurrences 
mostly occur in the first 2 years after treatment, whereas patients have a 
lifelong elevated risk of second primary tumors. 75% of second primary tumors 
occur outside the oral cavity and over 50% outside the head and neck area, 
places not routinely checked. There is no convincing evidence this 5-year 
follow-up programme yields survival benefits. It would therefore be better to 
limit follow-up care to 2 years and choose a subsequent follow-up programme 
better tailored to the individual patient's needs. This does not necessarily 
require the lead of a head and neck oncologist.

Publisher: Door een toegenomen incidentie van mondholtekanker en verbeterde 
overleving zal in Nederland het aantal patiënten dat nazorg behoeft toenemen. 
Vooralsnog worden deze patiënten de eerste 5 jaar na behandeling routinematig 
gecontroleerd onder andere om recidieven of tweede primaire tumoren vroegtijdig 
op te sporen en zo de prognose te verbeteren. Recidieven treden vooral op in de 
eerste 2 jaar na behandeling, terwijl patiënten hun leven lang een verhoogd 
risico hebben op tweede primaire tumoren. Driekwart van de tweede primaire 
tumoren bevindt zich buiten de mondholte en meer dan de helft buiten het 
hoofd-halsgebied, locaties waar niet routinematig wordt gecontroleerd. Er is 
geen overtuigend bewijs dat dit 5-jarige nacontroleprogramma overlevingswinst 
oplevert. Het is daarom beter de nacontrole tot 2 jaar te beperken om daarna te 
kiezen voor een invulling van de nacontrole die beter aansluit bij de specifieke 
behoeften van de patiënt. De hoofd-halsoncoloog hoeft hier niet 
noodzakelijkerwijs de regie te hebben.

BACKGROUND: Georgia has one of the highest smoking prevalence and 
tobacco-related morbidity and mortality rates in Europe and Central Asia. 
Nonetheless, tax increases on tobacco products are often opposed due to concerns 
of regressive fiscal effects. This article provides evidence on the long-term 
welfare and distributional impacts of increasing cigarette taxes in Georgia.
METHODS: An Extended Cost-Benefit Analysis is used to simulate the 
distributional effect of raising taxes on cigarettes. It weighs short-term 
losses due to higher tobacco prices with long-term benefits related to reduced 
medical expenses and additional earnings associated with extended life 
expectancy. Household expenditure data are used to estimate decile-specific 
price elasticities of demand for cigarettes, accounting for heterogeneous 
behavioral responses by income-group.
RESULTS: Consistent with previous literature, cigarettes price elasticity 
decreases with income. A simulated 50% cigarette price increase would yield 
positive net gains for the lowest three deciles; increase the available income 
of the poorest 10% of the population by an average of 1% and, as a result, lift 
up to 7000 people out-of-poverty in 2017. The effects would be highly 
progressive.
CONCLUSIONS: As lower-income households tend to be more responsive to price 
changes on cigarettes, they stand to benefit most from the health and economic 
consequences of taxing tobacco. This article shows that in addition to boosting 
fiscal revenues, increasing cigarette prices would lead to progressive and 
positive net gains for the poorest households in Georgia.

We present the hypothesis that advanced stage cancer is also a heart failure 
syndrome. It can develop independently of or in addition to cardiotoxic effects 
of anti-cancer therapies. This includes an increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias. We suggest the pathophysiologic link for these developments 
includes generalized muscle wasting (i.e. sarcopenia) due to tissue homeostasis 
changes leading to cardiac wasting associated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac wasting 
with thinning of the ventricular wall increases ventricular wall stress, even in 
the absence of ventricular dilatation. In addition, arrhythmias may be 
facilitated by cellular wasting processes affecting structure and function of 
electrical cells and conduction pathways. We submit that in some patients with 
advanced cancer (but not terminal cancer), heart failure therapy or 
defibrillators may be relevant treatment options. The key points in selecting 
patients for such therapies may be the predicted life expectancy, quality of 
life at intervention time, symptomatic burden, and consequences for further 
anti-cancer therapies. The cause of death in advanced cancer is difficult to 
ascertain and consensus on event definitions in cancer is not established yet. 
Clinical investigations on this are called for. Broader ethical considerations 
must be taken into account when aiming to target cardiovascular problems in 
cancer patients. We suggest that focused attention to evaluating cardiac wasting 
and arrhythmias in cancer will herald a further evolution in the rapidly 
expanding field of cardio-oncology.

and Medical Sciences, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, 
Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: The extent to which positive surgical margins (PSM) affect the risk 
of subsequent salvage radiation therapy (sRT) or androgen depletion therapy 
(ADT) following radical prostatectomy (RP) is not well described. Initiation of 
additional therapies after RP depend on patient preference, individual factors, 
local guidelines, and life expectancy. The aim of this study was to analyze 
differences between margin status in risk of subsequent treatment for PCa 
following RP in a retrospective population-based cohort from Denmark.
METHODS: Patients who underwent RP were identified in The Danish Prostate Cancer 
Registry (DaPCaR). Subsequent sRT and ADT were assessed in uni- and multivariate 
settings and validated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
RESULTS: PSM was associated with an increased risk of sRT (HR = 1.85, p < .001) 
and receiving ADT (HR:1.39, p = .007). Margin status only had a minor impact on 
the predictive ability for sRT (area under the curve (AUC): p < .001) and no 
significant impact for subsequent ADT (AUC: p = 1). Significant 
inter-institutional difference in the association between PSM with sRT or ADT 
was observed.
CONCLUSION: PSM is associated with the risk of sRT and initiation of ADT, 
however this association is weak. Our results underline that factors beyond 
tumor characteristics play a major role for initiation of sRT and ADT.

Vaccination is an essential way to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B virus 
(HBV). Various studies have been published on the cost-effectiveness of HBV 
vaccination, but since the results vary according to the target population and 
related health outcomes, this study examined the cost-effectiveness of the 
universal HBV vaccination in Iran. In this economic evaluation study, a decision 
tree with the Markov model was used to compare the universal HBV vaccination 
with a strategy of non-vaccination. Health states used in the model included 
healthy, chronic hepatitis B, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Analyses were performed from a payer's 
perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life-year gained, 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were calculated at a 5% annual 
discount rate. The sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo 
simulation. Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and TreeAge Pro 2011 
software. In 2017, the estimated cost per dose for any HBV vaccine was $3.20 
USD. The universal HBV vaccination was economically advantageous compared to 
non-vaccination, and the estimated cost of this program per life-year and QALY 
gained were $6,319 and negative (-) $1,183.85 USD, respectively. Given the 
uncertainty of all parameters, the model remained robust and reliable. In Iran, 
the universal HBV vaccination strategy for both health outcomes of QALY and 
life-years gained was cost-effective and advantageous. The vaccination strategy 
saved money, increased life years and improved quality of life. Therefore, it is 
recommended that this program continues to be provided.

Biological age acceleration (BAA) models based on blood tests or DNA methylation 
emerge as a de facto standard for quantitative characterizations of the aging 
process. We demonstrate that deep neural networks trained to predict morbidity 
risk from wearable sensor data can provide a high-quality and cheap alternative 
for BAA determination. The GeroSense BAA model was trained and validated using 
steps per minute recordings from 103,830 one-week long and 2,599 of up to 2 
years-long longitudinal samples and exhibited a superior association with 
life-expectancy over the average number of steps per day in, e.g., groups 
stratified by professional occupations. The association between the BAA and 
effects of lifestyles, the prevalence of future incidence of diseases was 
comparable to that of BAA from models based on blood test results. Wearable 
sensors let sampling of BAA fluctuations at time scales corresponding to days 
and weeks and revealed the divergence of organism state recovery time 
(resilience) as a function of chronological age. The number of individuals 
suffering from the lack of resilience increased exponentially with age at a rate 
compatible with Gompertz mortality law. We speculate that due to the stochastic 
character of BAA fluctuations, its mean and auto-correlation properties together 
comprise the minimum set of biomarkers of aging in humans.

BACKGROUND: Veterans are at increased risk of lung cancer and many have 
comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary 
artery disease (CAD). We used simulation modeling to assess projected outcomes 
associated with different management strategies of Veterans with stage I 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with COPD and/or CAD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from a cohort of 14,029 Veterans (years 
2000-2015) with NSCLC we extended a well-validated mathematical model of lung 
cancer to represent the management and outcomes of Veterans with stage I NSCLC 
with COPD, with or without comorbid CAD. We simulated multiple randomized trials 
to compare treatment with lobectomy, limited resection, or stereotactic body 
radiation therapy (SBRT). Model output estimated expected quality adjusted life 
years (QALY) of Veterans with stage I NSCLC according to age, tumor size, 
histologic subtype, COPD severity and CAD diagnosis.
RESULTS: For Veterans <70 years old lobectomy was associated with greater 
projected quality-adjusted life expectancy regardless of comorbidity status. For 
most combinations of tumors and comorbidity profiles there was no dominant 
treatment for Veterans ≥80 years of age, but less invasive treatments were often 
superior to lobectomy. Dominant treatment choices differed by CAD status for 
older patients in a third of scenarios, but not for patients <70 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: The harm/benefit ratio of treatments for stage I NSCLC among 
Veterans may vary according to COPD severity and the presence of CAD. This 
information can be used to direct future research study design for Veterans with 
stage I lung cancer and COPD and/or CAD.

BACKGROUND: Data are lacking about the benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy 
(ET) in older patients with multiple comorbidities. The authors sought to 
determine the effect of ET on the survival of older patients who had multiple 
comorbidities and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, pathologic node-negative (pN0) breast cancer.
METHODS: Women aged ≥70 years in the National Cancer Database (2010-2014) with 
Charlson/Deyo comorbidity scores of 2 or 3 who had pathologic tumor 
(pT1)-pT3/pN0, ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer were divided into 2 
cohorts: adjuvant ET and no ET. Propensity scores were used to match patients 
based on age, comorbidity score, facility type, pT classification, chemotherapy, 
surgery, and radiation therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to 
estimate the effect of ET on overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: In the nonmatched cohort (n = 3716), 72.8% of patients received ET (n = 
2705), and 27.2% did not (n = 1011). The patients who received ET were younger 
(mean age, 76 vs 79 years; P < .001) and had higher rates of breast conservation 
compared with those who did not receive ET (lumpectomy plus radiation: 43.4% vs 
23.8%, respectively; P < .001). In the matched cohort (n = 1972), the median OS 
was higher in the ET group (79.2 vs 67.7 months; P < .0001). In the adjusted 
analysis, ET was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 
0.59-0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: In older patients who have pN0, ER-positive/HER2-negative breast 
cancer with comorbidities, adjuvant ET was associated with improved OS, which 
may have been overestimated given the confounders inherent in observational 
studies. To optimize outcomes in these patients, current standard 
recommendations should be considered stage-for-stage based on life expectancy 
and the level of tolerance to treatment.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic in Wales and the UK has highlighted 
significant and historic inequalities in health between social groups. To better 
understand the composition of these inequalities and inform planning after the 
pandemic, we undertook a decomposition of life expectancy inequalities between 
the most and least deprived quintiles for men and women by age and cause of 
death and explored trends between 2002 and 2018.
STUDY DESIGN: Statistical decomposition of life expectancy inequalities by age 
and cause of death using routine population mortality datasets.
METHODS: We used routine statistics from the Office for National Statistics for 
the period 2002-2018 on population and deaths in Wales stratified by age, 
gender, Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2019 quintile and cause of 
death, categorised by International Classification of Disease, version 10, code 
into 15 categories of public health relevance. We aggregated data to 3-year 
rolling figures to account for low numbers of events in some groups annually. 
Next, we estimated life expectancy at birth by quintile, gender and period using 
life table methods. Lastly, we performed a decomposition analysis using the 
Arriaga method to identify the specific disease categories and ages at which 
excess deaths occur in more disadvantaged areas to highlight potential areas for 
action.
RESULTS: Life expectancy inequalities between the most and least WIMD quintiles 
rose for both genders between 2002 and 2018: from 4.69 to 6.02 years for women 
(an increase of 1.33 years) and from 6.34 to 7.42 years for men (an increase of 
1.08 years). Exploratory analysis of these trends suggested that the following 
were most influential for women: respiratory disease (1.50 years), cancers (1.36 
years), circulatory disease (1.35 years) and digestive disease (0.51 years). For 
men, the gap was driven by circulatory disease (2.01 years), cancers (1.39 
years), respiratory disease (1.25 years), digestive disease (0.79 years), drug- 
and alcohol-related conditions (0.54 years) and external causes (0.54 years). 
Contributions for women from respiratory disease, cancers, dementia and drug- 
and alcohol-related conditions appeared to be increasing, while among men, there 
were rising contributions from respiratory, digestive and circulatory disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy inequalities in Wales remain wide and have been 
increasing, particularly among women, with indications of worsening trends since 
2010 following the introduction of fiscal austerity. As agencies recover from 
the pandemic, these findings should be considered alongside any resumption of 
services in Wales or future health and public policy.

A novel killer toxin produced by yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima was purified 
and added into ready to cook meatballs to enhance their microbial safety and 
extension of their shelf life. The agent was added into ready to cook meatballs 
at two different concentrations (1%-K1 and 2%-K2). The results of those two 
groups were compared to the control group (K0) lacking the killer toxin. 
Physical, chemical and microbiological analyses were carried out in meat dough 
and all analyses were repeated at two day intervals during 10 day-storage at 
+4 °C. Addition of inhibitor compound in meat dough decreased the numbers of 
total aerobic mesophillic bacteria, yeast and molds and lactic acid bacteria. 
Staphylococci/Micrococci, coliform bacteria and total psychrotrophic bacterial 
counts of the samples were determined as well. Results showed that all 
indicators of microbial deterioration were found to be higher in K1 group than 
K2 group, revealing that there was an inverse correlation between the 
concentration of killer toxin and the number of microorganisms causing spoilage. 
In addition to 1 log decrease in the number of microorganisms in toxin added 
groups, the high TBARS values of the control group also showed the effectiveness 
of the toxin. Toxic effect analysis results showed that the killer toxin had no 
toxic effect on L929 mouse fibroblast cells after 24h exposure.
