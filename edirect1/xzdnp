Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder afflicting 0.5-2% of the world 
population for both sexes and all races with a capricious and unpredictable 
course. It has a complex etiology and varies in its manifestation, progression 
and response to treatment. Even if the precise aetiology and pathobiology of the 
disease are complex and still debated, recent evidence supports that vitiligo is 
a T CD8+ cell-mediated autoimmune disease triggered by oxidative stress. To date 
no clinical, biological and histological criteria allow us to establish the 
prognosis with certainty. The choice of the best therapy for adult and childhood 
vitiligo is based on various factors, such as the patient's age, psychological 
condition and expectations, distribution and extension of skin lesions, type of 
vitiligo (stable or not) and availability and cost of therapeutic options. Since 
vitiligo has a deep psychological impact on patients and their quality of life, 
treating the disease is very important. As dermatologists, we have important 
goals in the treatment of vitiligo patients: stabilization of the disease 
progression, repigmentation of the lesions and especially the persistence of the 
aforementioned repigmentation. Although several medical and surgical therapeutic 
options have been proposed, no definite cure has yet been developed and the 
long-term persistence of repigmentation is unpredictable. We review the 
different therapeutic options with particular attention on the recurrence rate.

OBJECTIVES: For patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), 
particularly for those with advanced disease, quality of life (QoL) is a key 
outcome measure. Therefore, we estimated survival-weighted psychometric scores 
(SWPS), life expectancy (LE), and quality-adjusted LE (QALE) in patients with 
advanced OSCC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: For estimation of survival function, we enrolled 2313 
patients with advanced OSCC diagnosed between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 
2013. The patients were followed until death or December 31, 2014. To acquire 
the QoL data, data from 194 patients were collected by employing the Taiwan 
Chinese versions of the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and Quality of 
Life Questionnaire Head and Neck 35 developed by the European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer and the EQ-5D-3L between October 1, 2013, and 
December 31, 2017. The LE of the patients with OSCC were estimated through 
linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve. SWPS and QALE were determined 
by integrating the LE and corresponding QoL outcomes.
RESULTS: For the patients with advanced OSCC, the estimated LE and QALE were 8.7 
years and 7.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively. The loss of LE 
and QALE was 19.0 years and 20.0 QALYs, respectively. The estimated lifetime 
impairments of swallowing, speech, cognitive functioning, physical functioning, 
social functioning, and emotional functioning were 8.3, 6.5, 6.5, 6.1, 5.7, and 
5.4 years, respectively. The estimated lifetime problems regarding mouth 
opening, teeth, social eating, and social contact were 6.6, 6.1, 7.5, and 6.1 
years, respectively. The duration of feeding tube dependency was estimated to be 
1.6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced OSCC had an estimated LE of 8.7 years and 
QALE of 7.7 QALYs. SWPS provided useful information regarding how advanced OSCC 
affects the subjective assessment of QoL. Our study results may serve as a 
reference for the allocation of cancer treatment resources.

The use of progressive strength training among the elderly has become an 
accepted part of evidence-based practice for preventive and rehabilitative care. 
Exercise is undoubtedly one of the pillars for resilient aging. While research 
has shown impressive outcomes from strength training, the challenge remains to 
get elderly persons to exercise. Here we describe a Finnish-Singaporean 
cross-national project that provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the 
implementation of strength training in settings where it had previously not been 
applied. We report from the first 2 years of implementation using assessment 
data and surveys directed to frontline therapists responsible for the 
implementation. The strength training concept was progressively implemented in 
24 elder care locations in Singapore including residential homes, day rehab/care 
centers, and senior activity centers. Each location was provided with training, 
support, gym equipment and technology solutions. It remained for individual 
sites to enroll elderly to the program, to perform assessments, and to direct 
the progressive strength training. Based on data from the first 2 years of 
implementation, improvements in lower body muscle strength were found in Leg 
Curl (ave 11.1-48.8%), Leg Extension (ave 10.2-24.0%) and Hip Abduction/Hip 
Adduction (ave 7.0-15.8%). Of the trained therapists, 95% strongly agreed or 
agreed to some extent that the implementation had been successful. The 
practice-based evidence from the project has demonstrated that it is feasible to 
implement progressive strength training in real life settings, using technology. 
While the implementation initially required handholding and support, the 
approach yielded consistent improvement rates in muscle strength comparable to 
results from randomized clinical trials (meta-analysis studies). Significant 
improvement rates in muscle strength were found in all three types of sites, 
demonstrating that gym training can be employed broadly in elder care. The 
Senior Activity Centers offer an interesting model for reaching seniors with 
preventive actions at an early stage. The data support a 3-month training as an 
effective intervention of introducing strength training in elder care settings, 
promoting healthy aging.

The average human life expectancy continues to rise globally and so does the 
prevalence and absolute burden of cardiovascular disease. Dietary restriction 
promotes longevity and improves various cardiovascular risk factors, including 
hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. However, low 
adherence to caloric restriction renders this stringent dietary intervention 
challenging to adopt as a standard practice for cardiovascular disease 
prevention. Hence, alternative eating patterns and strategies that recapitulate 
the salutary benefits of caloric restriction are under intense investigation. 
Here, we first provide an overview of alternative interventions, including 
intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting and the Mediterranean diet, along 
with their cardiometabolic effects in animal models and humans. We then present 
emerging pharmacological alternatives, including spermidine, NAD+ precursors, 
resveratrol, and metformin, as promising caloric restriction mimetics, and 
briefly touch on the mechanisms underpinning their cardiometabolic and 
health-promoting effects. We conclude that implementation of feasible dietary 
approaches holds the promise to attenuate the burden of cardiovascular disease 
and facilitate healthy aging in humans.

AIM: We investigated the relationship between cognitive function and olfactory 
and physical functions in middle-aged persons with and without type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) to examine the potential of olfactory and physical functions as biomarkers 
for early cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Enrolled were 70 T2D patients (age 40 to <65 y) and 81 age-matched 
control participants without diabetes. Cognitive function was assessed by the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test parts A and B 
(TMT-A/-B), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS), and Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). Multiple 
linear regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Odor identification was an independent determinant shown in the results 
of the TMT-A in the entire participant group and was independently associated 
with the MoCA and TMT-B in the T2D group. Balance capability assessed with a 
stabilometer was independently associated with all cognitive function tests 
except for QISD and SAS in the entire participant group and the T2D group and 
was independently associated with TMT-A in the control group. Knee extension 
strength was independently associated with the SAS in the entire participant 
group and the T2D group.
CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification, balance capability, and knee extension 
strength were potential markers for cognitive decline in middle-aged persons 
with T2D.

INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved survival 
outcomes versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated 
metastatic squamous NSCLC in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 
study. We present the results of Chinese patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE-407 
global and China extension studies.
METHODS: Patients enrolled from mainland China in the KEYNOTE-407 global 
(NCT02775435) and China extension studies (NCT03875092) were randomized 1:1 to 
35 cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo plus four cycles of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. Dual primary end points were overall survival (OS) 
and progression-free survival (PFS) (based on the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded independent central review).
RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were randomized (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, 
n = 65; placebo-chemotherapy, n = 60). As of September 30, 2020, median (range) 
study follow-up was 28.1 (25.1‒40.9) months. Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy improved 
OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.70) and PFS 
(HR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52) versus placebo-chemotherapy. Two-year OS and PFS 
rates for pembrolizumab-chemotherapy versus placebo-chemotherapy were 56.9% 
versus 31.7% and 24.2% versus 3.3%, respectively. Treatment-related grade 3 to 5 
adverse events occurred in 81.5% and 81.7%, respectively. Relative to baseline, 
pembrolizumab-chemotherapy improved global health status/quality of life scores 
at week 18 versus placebo-chemotherapy (difference in least squares means = 7.6, 
95% CI: 1.5-13.7) and prolonged time to deterioration in cough, chest pain, or 
dyspnea (HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy prolonged survival versus 
placebo-chemotherapy with manageable toxicity and preserved or improved 
health-related quality of life in Chinese patients with metastatic squamous 
NSCLC. These findings support pembrolizumab-chemotherapy as first-line therapy 
in this population.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine is delivered to children aged 3-59 
months as seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in areas where transmission is 
highly seasonal such as Chad and other Sahelian countries. Although clinical 
trials show a 75% reduction in malaria cases, evidence of SMC's impact at scale 
remains limited. Using data from the Chadian National Health Management 
Information System, we analyzed associations between SMC implementation during 
July-October and monthly district-level malaria incidence (suspected and 
confirmed outpatient cases) among children aged 0-59 months at health facilities 
in 23 health districts with SMC implementation during 2013-2018. Generalized 
additive models were fitted with separate cyclic cubic spline terms for each 
district to adjust for seasonality in cases. SMC implementation in Chad was 
associated, compared with no implementation, with lower monthly counts of both 
suspected (rate ratio [RR]: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.94. P = 0.006) and confirmed 
malaria cases (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.93, P = 0.003), representing around 20% 
reduction in malaria incidence. Sensitivity analyses showed effect sizes of up 
to 28% after modifying model assumptions. Caution should be exercised in 
interpreting our findings, which may not be comparable with other studies, and 
may over- or underestimate impact of SMC; not all malaria cases present at 
health facilities, not all suspected cases are tested, and not all facilities 
report cases consistently. This study's approach presents a solution for 
employing readily available routine data to evaluate the impact of health 
interventions at scale without extensive covariate data. Further efforts are 
needed to improve the quality of routine data in Chad and elsewhere.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer for 
males worldwide, but the spatial and temporal trends of prostate cancer burden 
remain unknown in Asia. This study aimed to investigate the changing spatial and 
temporal trends of incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY), and mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) of prostate cancer, and 
their association with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) in 48 Asian countries 
from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Health Data Exchange query tool, 
covering 48 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019. The average annual percent change 
was calculated to evaluate temporal trends. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was 
used to obtain spatial patterns, and the association between SDI and prostate 
cancer burden was estimated using a spatial panel model.
RESULTS: In Asia, the age-standardized incidence and prevalence of prostate 
cancer increased in almost all countries, and its mortality and DALY also 
increased in over half of the countries. Significantly regional disparities were 
found in Asia, and the hot spots for incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALY 
were all located in Western Asia, the hot spots of percent change also occurred 
in Western Asia for incidence and DALY. Furthermore, SDI had a positive 
association with mortality (coef = 2.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
2.13-2.90) and negative association with DALY (coef = -14.99, 95% CI: -20.37 to 
-9.60) and MIR (coef = -0.95, 95%CI: -0.99 to -0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer burden increased rapidly throughout Asia and 
substantial disparities had persisted between countries. Geographically targeted 
interventions are needed to reduce the prostate cancer burden throughout Asia 
and in specific countries.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centeredness (PC) aims to adapt health care to the 
individual needs and preferences of patients. An existing integrative model of 
PC comprises several dimensions of PC which have not yet been investigated from 
the patients' perspective. Older patients with multimorbidity represent a target 
group for patient-centered care, as their care needs are particularly complex 
and should be addressed individually. We aimed to assess the perspective that 
older patients with multimorbidity have of patient-centered care and to examine 
the transferability of the integrative model of PC to this specific population.
METHOD: We performed 4 guided focus group interviews with a total of 20 older 
individuals with multimorbidity. The focus group interviews were audio-recorded 
and transcribed verbatim. Patients' statements were content-analyzed applying an 
a priori designed system of categories that included the dimensions of PC from 
the integrative model and the additional category 'prognosis and life 
expectancy', which had emerged from an initial literature search on aspects of 
PC specific to the multimorbid elderly.
RESULTS: The new category 'prognosis and life expectancy' was confirmed and 
expanded to 'individual care needs related to aging and chronic disesase'. All 
dimensions of our integrative PC model were confirmed for older patients with 
multimorbidity. Among these, we found that eight dimensions (individual care 
needs related to aging and chronic disease, biopsychosocial perspective, 
clinician-patient communication, essential characteristics of the clinician, 
clinician-patient-relationship, involvement of family and friends, coordination 
and continuity of care, access to care) were complemented by aspects specific to 
this target population.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrative PC model is applicable to the population of older 
patients with multimorbidity. For a population-specific adaptation, it might be 
complemented by the dimension 'individual care needs in aging and chronic 
disease', in conjunction with age-specific aspects within existing dimensions. 
Together with corresponding results from a Delphi survey, our adapted PC model 
will serve as the basis for a subsequent systematic review of instruments 
measuring PC in older patients with multimorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Maternal sepsis and other maternal infections (MSMI) have 
considerable impacts on women's and neonatal health, but data on the global 
burden and trends of MSMI are limited. Comprehensive knowledge of the burden and 
trend patterns of MSMI is important to allocate resources, facilitate the 
establishment of tailored prevention strategies and implement effective clinical 
treatment measures.
METHODS: Based on data from the Global Burden of Disease database, we analysed 
the global burden of MSMI by the incidence, death, disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in the last 30 years. Then, the trends 
of MSMI were assessed by the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of MMR as 
well as the age-standardized rate (ASR) of incidence, death and DALY. Moreover, 
we determined the effect of sociodemographic index (SDI) on MSMI epidemiological 
parameters.
RESULTS: Although incident cases almost stabilized from 1990 to 2015, the ASR of 
incidence, death, DALY and MMR steadily decreased globally from 1990 to 2019. 
The burden of MSMI was the highest in the low SDI region with the fastest 
downward trends. MSMI is still one of the most important causes of maternal 
death in the developed world. Substantial diversity of disease burden and trends 
occurred in different regions and individual countries, most of which had 
reduced burden and downward trends. The MMR and ASR were negatively correlated 
with corresponding SDI value in 2019 in 204 countries/territories and 21 
regions.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight significant improvement in MSMI care in the 
past three decades, particularly in the low and low-middle SDI regions. However, 
the increased burden and upward trends of MSMI in a few countries and regions 
are raising concern, which poses a serious challenge to maternal health. More 
tailored prevention measures and additional resources for maternal health are 
urgently needed to resolve this problem.

BACKGROUND: Despite high prevalence, food aversions are closely linked to the 
dietary intake of pregnant women. Thus, understanding this behavior is important 
in addressing the issue of maternal nutrition. Therefore, the aim of this study 
is to provide information on the prevalence and associated factors of food 
aversion and its relationship with the nutritional status of pregnant women in 
Boricha Woreda, Sidama Regional state, Southern Ethiopia, 2019.
METHODS: A community based mixed cross sectional study was conducted among 505 
randomly selected pregnant mothers at Boricha Woreda, Southern Ethiopia from 
June 1-20, 2019. Pre-tested and structured face-to-face interview questionnaire 
and focus group discussion guide were used to collect quantitative and 
qualitative data respectively. The quantitative data were cleaned, coded and 
entered into Epi Info version 7.1.4.0 and then exported to SPSS IBM version 20 
for further analysis. The qualitative data were analyzed manually using a 
content analysis.The bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression was used 
to identify the possible factors of food aversion. AOR with the respective 95% 
CIs was used to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: Nearly, seven-in-ten (69.2%) of the pregnant women were averted of at 
least one food. Cereal (45.9%) and enset (44.2%) were averted by majority of the 
participants. The mean (± SD) MUAC measurement was 22.7 (± 2.4) cm. Pregnant 
women of age group of 24-28 [AOR = 3.04, 95% CI (1.72-5.35)] and 29-33 years 
[AOR = 2.00, 95% CI (1.02-3.92)], nausea during [AOR = 1.77, 95% CI (1.16-2.70)] 
and having additional meal [AOR = 1.68, 95% CI (1.02-2.75)] were significantly 
associated with food aversion. Maternal nutritional status and food aversion was 
sstatistically significant (p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: High prevalence of food aversions (69.2%) and under nutrition 
(34.6%) among pregnant women is found. Therefore, the Woreda Health Office needs 
to intensify the integration of maternal nutrition into ANC services and 
training of health providers as well as critical appraisal of health extension 
workers should also be considered.

Plain Language Summary: Pregnancy is a complex and absolutely important period 
in women’s life. Thus, in order to sustain a successful pregnancy, a mother 
experiences a number of physiological and behavioral changes. Notably, food 
aversions are the number one changes experienced by pregnant women. Food 
aversions are characterized by the repulsion and avoidance of particular foods 
and the most common aversions are nonalcoholic caffeinated beverages, meat, 
fish, poultry and eggs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the 
magnitude and its association with nutritional status of Pregnant Women in order 
to provide concrete scientific evidence for the concerned stakeholders.A 
community based mixed cross-sectional study was conducted among 505 pregnant 
mothers selected from five randomly selected kebeles of Boricha Woreda. Pregnant 
women in the age range of 19 to 49 years and who were apparently healthy were 
interviewed. Four hundred ninety seven participants were interviewed voluntarily 
with a response rate of 98.4%. The mean (± SD) age of the women was 22.3 (± 5.5) 
years. Pregnant women who were averted at least one food were 344(69.2%); where 
cereal (45.9%) and enset (44.2%) were averted by the majority of the 
participants. Hence pregnant women who practice food aversion had higher likely 
to be a malnourished. Pregnant women who were less than thirty three years of 
age, who had nausea, and ate additional meal were more urged to avert a 
particular foods. Whereas, women with better nutritional status had less food 
aversion practice.In conclusion; despite a pregnant woman requires a healthy 
diet embedded with adequate intake of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals to 
meet maternal and fetal needs, the magnitude of food aversion and maternal under 
nutrition in the study area was high.

Low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome are seen in many chronic diseases, 
including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Lifestyle 
interventions which combine different non-pharmacological therapies have shown 
synergizing effects in improving outcomes in patients with other chronic 
diseases or increased risk thereof, especially cardiovascular disease. For RA 
and metabolic syndrome-associated OA (MSOA), whole food plant-based diets 
(WFPDs) have shown promising results. A WFPD, however, had not yet been combined 
with other lifestyle interventions for RA and OA patients. In this protocol 
paper, we therefore present Plants for Joints, a multidisciplinary lifestyle 
program, based on a WFPD, exercise, and stress management. The objective is to 
study the effect of this program on disease activity in patients with RA 
(randomized controlled trial [RCT] 1), on a risk score for developing RA in 
patients with anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive arthralgia 
(RCT 2) and on pain, stiffness, and function in patients with MSOA (RCT 3), all 
in comparison with usual care.We designed three 16-week observer-blind RCTs with 
a waiting-list control group for patients with RA with low to moderate disease 
activity (2.6 ≤ Disease Activity Score [DAS28] ≤ 5.1, RCT 1, n = 80), for 
patients at risk for RA, defined by ACPA-positive arthralgia (RCT 2, n = 16) and 
for patients with metabolic syndrome and OA in the knee and/or hip (RCT 3, n = 
80). After personal counseling on diet and exercise, participants join 10 group 
meetings with 6-12 other patients to receive theoretical and practical training 
on a WFPD, exercise, and stress management, while medication remains unchanged. 
The waiting-list control group receives usual care, while entering the program 
after the RCT. Primary outcomes are: difference in mean change between 
intervention and control groups within 16 weeks for the DAS28 in RA patients 
(RCT 1), the RA-risk score for ACPA positive arthralgia patients (RCT 2), and 
the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score for 
MSOA patients (RCT 3). Continued adherence to the lifestyle program is measured 
in a two-year observational extension study.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe mental disorders (namely schizophrenia, major 
depression and bipolar disorder) have a reduced life expectancy of at least 10 
to 25 years compared with the general population. This mortality gap is due to 
the higher prevalence of comorbid physical disorders (such as diabetes, 
hypertension and cardiovascular diseases) in these patients compared to the 
general population. Factors contributing to the mortality gap include lack of 
access to primary care services, severity of clinical symptoms, internalized 
stigma and discrimination by healthcare professionals, pharmacological 
treatments and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Several international studies 
have highlighted the high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours in 
patients with severe mental disorders, but a few data are available from Italian 
real-world settings.
AIM: The present study aims to: 1) describe the lifestyle behaviours adopted by 
a sample of real-world patients affected by severe mental disorders; 2) identify 
differences in lifestyle behaviours according to diagnostic category.
MATERIALS: The final sample consisted of 402 patients, mainly female (57%), with 
a mean age of 45.8±11.8 years. 35% of them suffers from moderate obesity and 40% 
of them is affected by hyperinsulinemia, hypercolestereloemia and 
hypertrygliceridemia. 70% of patients has sedentary behaviours. Moderate to 
severe nicotine dependence is reported by 42% of patients. Patients with bipolar 
disorders are more frequently smokers compared to other patients. No significant 
differences in lifestyle behaviours have been found among the three diagnostic 
groups.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that patients with severe mental 
disorders adopt unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, regardless their diagnosis. New 
psychosocial interventions, including motivational and psychoeducational 
components and targeting lifestyle behaviours, should be developed and 
disseminated in order to reduce the mortality gap.

PURPOSE: Proximal rectus femoris avulsions (PRFA) are relatively rare injuries 
that occur predominantly among young soccer players. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate midterm postoperative results including strength potential via 
standardized strength measurements after proximal rectus femoris tendon 
refixation. It was hypothesized that the majority of competitive athletes return 
to competition (RTC) after refixation of the rectus femoris tendon without 
significant strength or functional deficits compared to the contralateral side.
METHODS: Patients with an acute (< 6 weeks) PRFA who underwent surgical 
refixation between 2012 and 2019 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were 
evaluated. The outcome measures compiled were the median Tegner Activity Scale 
(TAS) and mean RTC time frames, Harris Hip Score (HHS), Hip and Groin Outcome 
Score (HAGOS) subscales, International Hip Outcome Tool-33 (iHOT-33), and Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. In addition, a standardized isometric strength 
assessment of knee flexion, knee extension, and hip flexion was performed to 
evaluate the functional result of the injured limb in comparison to the 
uninjured side.
RESULTS: Out of 20 patients, 16 (80%) patients were available for final 
assessment at a mean follow-up of 44.8 ± SD 28.9 months. All patients were male 
with 87.5% sustaining injuries while playing soccer. The average time interval 
between trauma and surgery was 18.4 ± 8.5 days. RTC was possible for 14 out of 
15 previously competitive athletes (93.3%) at a mean 10.5 ± 3.4 months after 
trauma. Patients achieved a high level of activity postoperatively with a median 
(interquartile range) TAS of 9 (7-9) and reported good to excellent outcome 
scores (HHS: 100 (96-100); HAGOS: symptoms 94.6 (89.3-100), pain 97.5 
(92.5-100), function in daily living 100 (95-100), function in sport and 
recreation 98.4 (87.5-100), participation in physical activities 100 (87.5-100), 
quality of life 83.1 ± 15.6; iHot-33: 95.1 (81.6-99.8)). No postoperative 
complications were reported. Range of motion, isometric knee flexion and 
extension, as well as hip flexion strength levels were not statistically 
different between the affected and contralateral legs. The majority of patients 
were "very satisfied" (56.3%) or "satisfied" (37.5%) with the postoperative 
result and reported little pain (VAS 0 (0-0.5)).
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of acute PRFA yields excellent postoperative 
results in a young and highly active cohort. Hip flexion and knee extension 
strength was restored fully without major surgical complications.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective cohort study; III.

INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab plus cabozantinib improved progression-free survival and 
overall survival compared with sunitinib in the first-line treatment of advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) according to CheckMate 9ER study.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of 
nivolumab plus cabozantinib with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment 
of advanced RCC. Primary outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Model uncertainty was 
assessed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The total cost per patient was $681,425 for nivolumab plus cabozantinib 
and $256,302 for sunitinib. The incremental QALY for nivolumab plus cabozantinib 
was 0.49 compared with sunitinib. The ICER for nivolumab plus cabozantinib was 
$863,720 per QALY gained versus sunitinib. The results remained robust in 
univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000, 
nivolumab plus cabozantinib was not cost-effective under current drug pricing in 
the first-line treatment of advanced RCC from a US payer's perspective.

Erratum in
    Pharmacoeconomics. 2022 Apr 1;:

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer (Kyowa Kirin) of mogamulizumab (Poteligeo®), as part of the single 
technology appraisal process, to submit evidence for its clinical and 
cost-effectiveness for previously treated mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary 
syndrome (SS). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht 
University Medical Centre, was commissioned to act as the independent evidence 
review group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents 
the ERG's critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the 
CS, highlights the key methodological considerations and describes the 
development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. Based on a 
systematic literature review, one randomised controlled trial, MAVORIC, was 
identified showing favourable results in patients with MF and SS. However, 
MAVORIC compared mogamulizumab to vorinostat, which is not standard care in the 
NHS, and there is uncertainty due to the study design, specifically crossover of 
patients. Based on a "naïve comparison of results from the vorinostat arm of the 
MAVORIC study and the physician's choice arm (methotrexate or bexarotene i.e. 
United Kingdom [UK] standard treatments) of the ALCANZA study as well as 
comparison to Phase II bexarotene data", the company considered vorinostat to be 
"a reasonable proxy for current standard of care in the NHS". The ERG 
considered, based on the limited data available, that the comparability of 
vorinostat (MAVORIC) and physician's choice (ALCANZA) could not be established. 
In response to the Appraisal Consultation Document, the company provided an 
unanchored matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of mogamulizumab with UK 
standard care by analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. However, 
given the high risk of bias of an unanchored MAIC, these results needed to be 
regarded with a considerable degree of caution. The economic analysis suffered 
from uncertainty because there was no trial evidence on the comparator in the 
England and Wales National Health Service (NHS), and it was unclear to what 
extent the trial (MAVORIC) comparator (vorinostat) was comparable to standard 
care, referred to as established clinical management (ECM) in the NHS. The 
evidence for overall survival had not reached maturity and was confounded by 
treatment switching, for which different crossover adjustment methods produced 
large variations in life years. Caregiver utilities were applied in the 
analysis, but there was a lack of guidance on their application and whether 
these were indicated in this appraisal. After consultation, the company updated 
the economic analysis with the MAIC. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
comparing mogamulizumab against ECM were (depending on whether the HES or 
MAVORIC comparison were used) £31,030 or £32,634 per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained according to the company's base case and £38,274 or £80,555 per 
QALY gained according to the ERG's base case. NICE did not recommend 
mogamulizumab for treating MF or SS in adults who have had at least one previous 
systemic treatment. This decision was subsequently appealed, and an appeal 
decision has been reached.

Type 1 diabetes represents an autoimmune condition with a strong inherited 
background, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. About 25% of such cases 
are diagnosed in adulthood, some even as late as the ninth decade of life. The 
number of older adults with type 1 diabetes is increasing due to improvements in 
care and decreased mortality rate. However, there is a lack of clinical trials 
in people older than 70 years of age with type 1 diabetes complicated with 
comorbidities, frailty, and dependency. The management of type 1 diabetes and 
the goals of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's health 
status and life expectancy. In healthier older adults, insulin treatment 
regimens (multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy) that 
approximate the normal physiology of insulin secretion should be used to achieve 
lower glycemic goals, while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia with frequent 
glucose monitoring (preferably using continuous glucose monitoring systems). For 
frail individuals with poor health, simpler insulin regimens and less stringent
