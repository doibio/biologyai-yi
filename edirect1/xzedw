patients after HT. When surgery is indicated for Bethesda category II nodules, 
and in the absence of any indication for surgery on the contralateral lobe, HT 
is recommended. In patients with thyroid cancer (TC)≤1cm requiring surgical 
management or TC≤2cm, in the absence of risk factors for TC and in the absence 
of pre- or intraoperative detection of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node 
metastases (cN0) and/or suspected contra-lateral disease, HT is the preferred 
technique as long as the patient accepts the possibility of TT which might be 
required when aggressive forms of cancer are detected on definitive 
cytohistology (extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, high-grade 
histology). For TC measuring between 2 and 4cm, the debate between HT and TT 
remains open today, although some surgeons tend to prefer TT. In patients with 
TC>4cm, macroscopic lymph node involvement (cN1), signs of extrathyroidal 
extension or predisposing factors for TC, TT is the treatment of choice.

Regional health differences - developing a socioeconomic deprivation index for 
Germany.

For Germany, regional differences for various health indicators, which are also 
associated with socioeconomic factors, have been documented. This article aims 
to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for Germany that (1) can 
be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) 
provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany. The core 
data stem from the INKAR (indicators and maps on spatial and urban development 
in Germany and Europe) database compiled by Germany's Federal Institute for 
Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. Factor analysis is 
used for indexing and the weighting of indicators for the three dimensions of 
education, occupation and income. The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation 
(GISD) is generated at the levels of associations of municipalities, 
administrative districts and administrative regions for the years 1998, 2003, 
2008 and 2012. Aggregate data and individual data from the German Health Update 
2014/2015-EHIS (GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS) study are used to analyse associations 
between the index and selected health indicators. For around two thirds of the 
causes of death, the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation reveals 
significant socioeconomic inequalities at the level of Germany's administrative 
regions. At district level, life expectancy in the bottom fifth of districts 
presenting the highest levels of deprivation is, depending on the observation 
period, 1.3 years lower for women and 2.6 years lower for men in comparison to 
the upper fifth of districts presenting the lowest levels of deprivation. The 
index can explain 45.5% and 62.2% of regional differences in life expectancy for 
women and men, respectively. Moreover, the population in regions characterised 
by high levels of deprivation has significantly higher rates of smokers, engages 
less frequently in leisure-time physical activities and is more often obese. The 
German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation illustrates regional socioeconomic 
differences at different spatial levels and contributes to explaining regional 
health differences. This index is intended for use in research as well as by 
federal and federal state health reporting systems and should enable access to 
new sources of data for investigating the links between social inequalities and 
health in Germany.

BACKGROUND: Oral human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrheal, chlamydial, syphilitic 
and trichomonas infections are very common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) 
in Africa. However, no known study has reviewed the available evidence 
concerning the preventative interventions by dental care professionals (DCPs) in 
Africa on oral STDs; hence, this scoping review was conducted to evaluate the 
research landscape of this topic area in Africa.
METHODS: The scoping review methodology and documentation were informed by the 
Arksey and O'Malley's guideline, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for conducting Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
checklist, and the AMSTAR-2 guideline. Ten electronic research databases were 
searched to retrieve literatures relevant to the scoping review question. The 
retrieved literature were deduplicated and screened for eligibility based on the 
review's selection criteria. Data charting, collation and summarization were 
intended to be done in this review, but it could not be done because no relevant 
literature was found eligible for inclusion into this scoping review.
RESULTS: A total of 523 literature were retrieved. After deduplication of the 
retrieved literatures, the residual literatures (n = 353) were screened for 
eligibility for inclusion into the review, of which no eligible article was 
found. Hence, this scoping review was an empty review.
CONCLUSION: This empty scoping review demonstrates that DCPs in Africa do not 
engage in research-based oral STD prevention. Therefore, the implementation of 
research-based preventative interventions, by DCPs, on oral STDs should be 
encouraged in Africa.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Africa, natal and neonatal teeth is a culture-bound 
phenomenon which is associated with several sociocultural connotations which 
might affect child survival. Different empirical studies have been conducted in 
Africa on natal and neonatal teeth; however, no known scoping review has been 
conducted to map the empirical evidence. This systematic scoping review (SSR) 
aims to document the available empirical evidence, research gaps, and hotspots 
on neonatal and natal teeth in Africa.
METHODS: The methodology of this SSR was informed by the Joanna Brigg's 
Institute guidelines for SSRs, and it was reported in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews. Eleven research databases were systematically searched to 
scooped out all literatures relevant to the scoping review question, after which 
they were screened for eligibility based on the review's selection criteria. 
Only the eligible literatures were included in the review. Data were extracted 
from the included literatures, after which the extracted data were collated, 
summarized, and presented as results.
RESULTS: This review included only three journal articles. All the reviewed 
articles revealed knowledge gaps about natal/neonatal teeth. These articles also 
found misconceptions around natal/neonatal teeth; for example, nurses' and 
traditional birth attendants' beliefs about these teeth are contrary to 
scientifically known facts. Multiple myths associated with natal/neonatal teeth, 
as indicated in the reviewed studies, point to a poor understanding of the 
condition.
CONCLUSION: Neonates and infants are highly vulnerable persons; they require 
care and safeguarding from dental myths that could threaten their survival. 
Educative information concerning natal/neonatal teeth should be included in 
public health education programs to address the observed knowledge gaps among 
African populations and correct wrong beliefs on neonatal and natal teeth.

BACKGROUND: Patients with psoriasis have a significant disease burden throughout 
the life course. Nevertheless, the lifetime risk and disease burden of psoriasis 
across the entire lifespan is rarely quantified in an easily understandable way.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cumulative incidence rate, life expectancy, 
loss-of-life expectancy, and lifetime healthcare expenditures for incident 
psoriasis.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Using real-world nationwide data from the National Health 
Insurance Research Database of Taiwan for 2000-2017, along with the life tables 
of vital statistics, we estimated cumulative incidence rate, life expectancy, 
loss-of-life expectancy, and lifetime healthcare expenditures for those with 
psoriasis using a semi-parametric survival extrapolation method.
RESULTS: A total of 217,924 new psoriasis cases were identified. The lifetime 
risk of psoriasis in patients aged 18-80 for both sexes decreased in Taiwan with 
a cumulative incidence rate of 7.93% in 2000 to 3.25% in 2017. The mean 
(±standard error) life expectancy after diagnosis was 27.11 (± 1.15) and 27.14 
(±1.17) years for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic 
arthritis, respectively. Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis had a mean (±standard error) loss-of-life expectancy of 6.41 
(±1.16) and 6.48 (±1.17) due to psoriasis, respectively. Male patients have 
higher lifetime and annual lifetime healthcare expenditures than female. Mean 
life expectancy, loss-of-life expectancy, and lifetime cost were relatively 
higher for younger patients.
CONCLUSION: Among psoriatic patients, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis 
and psoriatic arthritis had substantial years of life lost, particularly for 
younger patients. Our results provide a reliable estimation of lifetime disease 
burden, and these estimates will help health authorities in cost-effectiveness 
assessments of public health interventions and allocation of services resources 
to minimize loss-of-life expectancy, and lifetime healthcare expenditures in 
patients with psoriasis.

PROBLEMS: For people all over the world, cancer is one of the most feared 
diseases. Cancer is one of the major obstacles to improving life expectancy in 
countries around the world and one of the biggest causes of death before the age 
of 70 in 112 countries. Among all kinds of cancers, breast cancer is the most 
common cancer for women. The data showed that female breast cancer had become 
one of the most common cancers.
AIMS: A large number of clinical trials have proved that if breast cancer is 
diagnosed at an early stage, it could give patients more treatment options and 
improve the treatment effect and survival ability. Based on this situation, 
there are many diagnostic methods for breast cancer, such as computer-aided 
diagnosis (CAD).
METHODS: We complete a comprehensive review of the diagnosis of breast cancer 
based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) after reviewing a sea of recent 
papers. Firstly, we introduce several different imaging modalities. The 
structure of CNN is given in the second part. After that, we introduce some 
public breast cancer data sets. Then, we divide the diagnosis of breast cancer 
into three different tasks: 1. classification; 2. detection; 3. segmentation.
CONCLUSION: Although this diagnosis with CNN has achieved great success, there 
are still some limitations. (i) There are too few good data sets. A good public 
breast cancer dataset needs to involve many aspects, such as professional 
medical knowledge, privacy issues, financial issues, dataset size, and so on. 
(ii) When the data set is too large, the CNN-based model needs a sea of 
computation and time to complete the diagnosis. (iii) It is easy to cause 
overfitting when using small data sets.

Background The right ventricle (RV) in the fetus is the predominant chamber, 
accounting for about 60% of the total cardiac output. The majority of the RV 
outflow volume is diverted from the pulmonary artery via the ductus arteriosus 
to the descending aorta. After birth, the RV undergoes extensive structural and 
functional modifications. The RV undergoes an improper transition from fetal to 
neonatal circulation in sick neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) babies. 
Functional echocardiography is now commonly being used in most NICUs as it is a 
noninvasive and bedside investigation that gives an immediate evaluation of 
hemodynamics and can be taken into consideration as an extension of clinical 
assessment to study a critically unwell neonate. Therefore, a study of RV 
functions in NICU neonates will help in better understanding the neonatal 
cardiopulmonary response to different diseases. Thus, this study aimed to assess 
RV functions in neonates getting admitted to the NICU of a tertiary care 
institute. Methodology This observational, cross-sectional study was approved by 
the Research & Recognition Committee of Dr. D. Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune. In 
total, 35 cases of term neonates admitted to the NICU at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical 
College, Hospital & Research Centre, Pune who fulfilled the inclusion criteria 
were enrolled in this study after obtaining consent from their parents. 
Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed by a trained pediatric 
cardiologist, and the findings were substantiated by a neonatologist trained in 
echocardiography. Results Our study found a strong association between tricuspid 
inflow velocity and neonates with sepsis. Similarly, a significant association 
was observed between abnormal tricuspid Inflow velocity (E/A and 
E/E') and neonates requiring inotropic support. Conclusions Data on the normal 
values of different echocardiographic parameters of the systolic and diastolic 
function of the RV during the neonatal phase of life are currently limited. Our 
data offer preliminary insights into this topic. Early echocardiography and 
intervention are advisable, especially in neonates with sepsis and requiring 
inotropic support.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) indications recently extended to 
lower surgical risk patients with longer life expectancy. Commissural alignment 
(CA) is one of the emerging concepts and is becoming one of the cornerstones of 
the TAVR procedure in a patient with increased longevity. Indeed, CA may improve 
transcatheter heart valve (THV) hemodynamics, future coronary access, and 
repeatability. The definition of CA has been recently standardized by the 
ALIGN-TAVR consortium using a four-tier scale based on CT analysis. Progress has 
been made during the index TAVR procedure to optimize CA, especially with 
self-expandable platforms. Indeed, specific delivery catheter orientation, THV 
rotation, and computed-tomography-derived views have been proposed to achieve a 
reasonable degree of CA. Recent data demonstrate feasibility, safety, and a 
significant reduction in coronary overlap using these techniques, especially 
with self-expandable platforms. This review provides an overview of THV CA 
including assessment methods, alignment techniques during the index TAVR 
procedure with different THV platforms, the clinical impact of commissural 
misalignment, and challenging situations for CA.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
colitis (UC), are lifelong diseases characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
gastrointestinal tract leading to its progressive and irreversible destruction. 
Whether early initiation of IBD-specific therapy impacts the long-term course of 
the disease remains unclear and has to be further explored in prospective 
disease-modification trials. Historically, surgery and hospitalization rates 
have been the surrogate markers to measure disease progression in IBD, providing 
an overview of the effectiveness of medical therapies. However, neither surgery 
nor hospitalization necessarily reflects a fail in therapeutic medical 
management, and many confounding factors make them biased outcomes. The 
Selecting Endpoints for Disease-Modification Trials consensus has defined the 
disease-modification endpoints required for these trials, including the impact 
of the disease on patient's life (health-related quality of life, disability, 
and fecal incontinence), the mid-term disease complications (bowel damage in CD, 
IBD-related surgery and hospitalizations, disease extension in UC, 
extra-intestinal manifestations, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome), and the 
development of dysplasia/cancer and mortality in the long term. Most available 
data in the literature regarding the impact of current therapies on disease 
progression focused on anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and are based on 
retrospective or post-hoc studies. Thus, prospective disease-modification trials 
are pressingly required to explore the effectiveness of early intensified 
treatment in patients with severe disease or at risk for disease progression.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The declining incidence of stroke, ischaemic heart 
disease (IHD) and dementia (the 'triple threat') in Norway encourages further 
investigation. The risks and trends of the three conditions were analysed using 
data from the Global Burden of Disease study.
METHODS: Global Burden of Disease 2019 estimations were used for age-, sex- and 
risk-factor-specific incidence and prevalence of the 'triple threat', their 
risk-factor-attributed deaths and disability combined, their age-standardized 
rates per 100,000 population in 2019 and their changes during 1990-2019. Data 
are presented as means and 95% uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, 71.1 thousand Norwegians were living with dementia, 157.2 
thousand with IHD and 95.2 thousand with stroke. In 2019, there were 9.9 
thousand (8.5 to 11.3) new cases of dementia (35.0% increase since 1990), 17.0 
thousand (14.6 to 19.6) with IHD (3.6% decrease) and 8.0 thousand (7.0 to 9.1) 
with stroke (12.9% decrease) in Norway. During 1990-2019, their age-standardized 
incidence rates decreased significantly-dementia by -5.4% (-8.4% to -3.2%), IHD 
by -30.0% (-31.4% to -28.6%) and stroke by -35.3% (-38.3% to -32.2%). There were 
significant declines in the attributable risks to both environmental and 
behavioural factors in Norway, but contradictory trends for metabolic risk 
factors during 1990-2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of the 'triple threat' conditions is declining in Norway, 
despite the increased prevalence. This offers the opportunity to find out why 
and how and to accelerate their joint prevention through new approaches and the 
promotion of the National Brain Health Strategy.

The extracellular matrix (ECM), composed of interlinked proteins outside of 
cells, is an important component of the human body that helps maintain tissue 
architecture and cellular homeostasis. As people age, the ECM undergoes changes 
that can lead to age-related morbidity and mortality. Despite its importance, 
ECM aging remains understudied in the field of geroscience. In this review, we 
discuss the core concepts of ECM integrity, outline the age-related challenges 
and subsequent pathologies and diseases, summarize diagnostic methods detecting 
a faulty ECM, and provide strategies targeting ECM homeostasis. To conceptualize 
this, we built a technology research tree to hierarchically visualize possible 
research sequences for studying ECM aging. This strategic framework will 
hopefully facilitate the development of future research on interventions to 
restore ECM integrity, which could potentially lead to the development of new 
drugs or therapeutic interventions promoting health during aging.

Background Healthcare systems are complex systems. Achieving financial, social, 
and environmental sustainability of these systems requires a high degree of 
integration and coordination at all levels, especially between acute-care 
settings and primary/community care services. Some authors have, therefore, 
suggest redirecting integrated healthcare research towards the network theory 
and network concepts as a useful lens. Objective The current paper proposes to 
investigate the existence, the institutional level of formalization and the 
degree of development of hospital/primary-community care Networks currently 
present in the main types of healthcare systems worldwide by studying an 
appropriate selection of representative countries for each system typology. 
Materials and Methods A narrative review of the scientific and gray literature 
following the methodology by Green et al. was, therefore, conducted to describe 
hospital and primary/community care networks and their integration/coordination 
in the main international models. To select these models, one country with the 
current highest life expectancy at birth for each of the B öhm's five healthcare 
system categories was chosen. The grade of integration of the Networks retrieved 
for each State was therefore qualitatively appraised (high, medium or low 
degree), following Valentijn's framework. Results The networks retrieved show: 
in Norway, Australia and Japan both at the government/ national and at the 
regional/lower level/other a high degree of systemic, organizational, normative 
and functional integration; in Switzerland both at the government/national and 
at the regional/lower level/other a medium degree of systemic, organizational, 
normative and functional integration; in the USA at the governmental/institution 
level a low degree of systemic, organizational and normative integration, with a 
medium degree of functional integration and at the regional/lower level/other 
integration a low degree of systemic and normative integration with medium 
degree of organization integration and high degree of functional integration. 
Discussion The high levels and degree of hospital/primary - community care 
integration of Norway, Australia and Japan are in line with what could be 
expected from the universalistic healthcare system in place. The medium levels 
of integration of Switzerland are also in line with what the Social health 
insurance system and, especially, the cantonal system. The low levels of 
integration of the USA are in line with the privatistic healthcare systems. 
However, a medium degree was found for functional integration probably due to 
its unparalleled technological advancement. Conclusions The study shows how the 
levels of hospital/primary-community care integration are connected to the 
specific healthcare system in place in each country. COVID-19 showed how complex 
systems like healthcare systems had to reconfigure themselves to reach high 
levels of integration in small time to be able to save lives and contain the 
spread of the virus. These results will prove useful for policymakers, 
healthcare and public health professionals in the task of establishing effective 
Networks to achieve high levels of integration in their institutions.

BACKGROUND: Occupational-related cancers are a substantial global health issue. 
The largest proportion of occupational-related cancers is tracheal, bronchus, 
and lung (TBL) cancer. This study aimed to explore the geographical and temporal 
trends in occupational carcinogens related to TBL cancer.
METHODS: Data on TBL cancer attributable to occupational carcinogens were 
collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Numbers and 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
and corresponding average annual percentage change (AAPC) were evaluated and 
stratified by geographic location, socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles, age, 
and sex.
RESULTS: Globally, ASRs of deaths and DALYs in TBL cancer attributable to 
occupational carcinogens showed a downward trend (AAPC = - 0.69%, - 1.01%) while 
increases were observed in the low, low-middle, and middle SDI quintiles. 
Although males accounted for 82.4% and 81.5% of deaths and DALYs in 2019, 
respectively, it showed an upward trend of ASRs in females (AAPC = 0.33%, 
0.02%). Occupational exposure to asbestos, silica and diesel engine exhaust were 
the top three causes of age-standardized TBL cancer deaths and DALYs. Over the 
past three decades, the percentage of age-standardized TBL cancer deaths and 
DALYs attributable to occupational asbestos and silica exposure decreased by 
18.24, 6.71 and 20.52%, 4.00% globally, but increased significantly in lower SDI 
regions, while the burden attributable to occupational diesel engine exhaust 
exposure increased by 32.76, 37.23% worldwide.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure remains an important risk factor for TBL 
cancer. The burden of TBL cancer attributable to occupational carcinogens showed 
obvious heterogeneity which decreased in higher SDI but increased in lower SDI 
regions. The burden of males was significantly higher than females, but the 
females showed an increasing trend. Occupational exposure to asbestos was the 
main causes of the burden. Therefore, effective prevention and control measures 
tailored to local conditions are necessary.

Graph Attention-based Curriculum Learning for Mental Healthcare Classification.

Ahmed U, Lin JC, Srivastava G.

Research has examined the use of user-generated data from online media as a 
means of identifying and diagnosing depression as a serious mental health issue 
that can have a significant impact on an individual's daily life. To achieve 
this, researchers have examined words in personal statements to identify 
depression. Besides aiding in diagnosing and treating depression, this research 
may also provide insight into its preva- lence within society. This paper 
introduces a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model for the classification of 
depression from online media. The model is based on masked self-attention 
layers, which assign different weights to each node in a neighbourhood without 
costly matrix operations. In addition, an emotion lexicon is extended by using 
hypernyms to improve the performance of the model. The results of the experiment 
demonstrate that the GAT model outperforms other architectures, achieving a ROC 
of 0.98. Furthermore, the embedding of the model is used to illustrate the 
contribution of the activated words to each symptom and to obtain qualitative 
agreement from psychiatrists. This technique is used to detect depressive 
symptoms in online forums with an improved detection rate. This technique uses 
previously learned embedding to illustrate the contribution of activated words 
to depressive symptoms in online forums. An improvement of significant magnitude 
was observed in the model's performance through the use of the soft lexicon 
extension method, resulting in a rise of the ROC from 0.88 to 0.98. The 
performance was also enhanced by an increase in the vocabulary and the adoption 
of a graph-based curriculum. The lexicon expansion method involved the 
generation of additional words with similar semantic attributes, utilizing 
similarity metrics to reinforce lexical features. The graph-based curriculum 
learning was utilized to handle more challenging training samples, allowing the 
model to develop increasing expertise in learning complex correlations between 
input data and output labels.

Bioprinting as an extension of 3D printing offers capabilities for printing 
tissues and organs for application in biomedical engineering. Conducting 
bioprinting in space, where the gravity is zero, can enable new frontiers in 
tissue engineering. Fabrication of soft tissues, which usually collapse under 
their own weight, can be accelerated in microgravity conditions as the external 
forces are eliminated. Furthermore, human colonization in space can be supported 
by providing critical needs of life and ecosystems by 3D bioprinting without 
relying on cargos from Earth, e.g., by development and long-term employment of 
living engineered filters (such as sea sponges-known as critical for initiating 
and maintaining an ecosystem). This review covers bioprinting methods in 
microgravity along with providing an analysis on the process of shipping 
bioprinters to space and presenting a perspective on the prospects of 
zero-gravity bioprinting.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of screening the U.S. population for Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Tier 1 genomic conditions is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous genomic screening 
for Lynch syndrome (LS), hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), 
and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
DESIGN: Decision analytic Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Separate age-based cohorts (ages 20 to 60 years at time of 
screening) of racially and ethnically representative U.S. adults.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health care payer.
INTERVENTION: Population genomic screening using clinical sequencing with a 
restricted panel of high-evidence genes, cascade testing of first-degree 
relatives, and recommended preventive interventions for identified probands.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer cases; 
incident cardiovascular events; quality-adjusted survival; and costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Screening 100 000 unselected 30-year-olds 
resulted in 101 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 77 to 127) fewer overall cancer 
cases and 15 (95% UI, 4 to 28) fewer cardiovascular events and an increase of 
495 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% UI, 401 to 757) at an incremental 
cost of $33.9 million (95% UI, $27.0 million to $41.1 million). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $68 600 per QALY gained (95% UI, $41 800 to 
$88 900).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Screening 30-, 40-, and 50-year-old cohorts was 
cost-effective in 99%, 88%, and 19% of probabilistic simulations, respectively, 
at a $100 000-per-QALY threshold. The test costs at which screening 30-, 40-, 
and 50-year-olds reached the $100 000-per-QALY threshold were $413, $290, and 
$166, respectively. Variant prevalence and adherence to preventive interventions 
were also highly influential parameters.
LIMITATIONS: Population averages for model inputs, which were derived 
predominantly from European populations, vary across ancestries and health care 
environments.
CONCLUSION: Population genomic screening with a restricted panel of 
high-evidence genes associated with 3 CDC Tier 1 conditions is likely to be 
cost-effective in U.S. adults younger than 40 years if the testing cost is 
relatively low and probands have access to preventive interventions.

AIMS: It remains unclear whether young patients with mental disorders have a 
higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than does the general population. Using a 
nationwide database, we investigated the prognostic association between the 
risks of myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke (IS), and mental disorders 
in young patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Young patients aged between 20 and 39 years old who 
underwent nationwide health examinations between 2009 and 2012 were screened. A 
total of 6 557 727 individuals were identified and subsequently classified 
according to mental disorders including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia, insomnia, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
personality disorder, somatoform disorder, eating disorder, and substance use 
disorder. Patients were then followed up for MI and IS until December 2018. 
Patients with mental disorders did not show unfavourable lifestyle behaviours or 
worse metabolic profiles than their counterparts. During the follow-up period 
(median, 7.6 years; interquartile range, 6.5-8.3), 16 133 cases of MI and 10 509 
cases of IS occurred. Patients with mental disorders had higher risks of MI 
(log-rank P = 0.033 in eating disorder and log-rank P < 0.001 in all other 
mental disorders). Patients with mental disorders had higher risks of IS except 
post-traumatic stress disorder (log-rank P = 0.119) and eating disorder 
(log-rank P = 0.828). After adjusting for covariates, the overall diagnosis and 
each mental disorder were independently associated with increased cardiovascular 
endpoints.
CONCLUSION: Mental disorders in young patients may have deleterious effects 
which increase the incidence of MI and IS. Prevention efforts are needed to 
prevent MI and IS in young patients with mental disorders.

Plain Language Summary: Although young patients with mental disorders did not 
show worse baseline characteristics in this nationwide study, mental disorders 
in young patients have deleterious effects on the incidence of both myocardial 
infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke (IS) events, across depressive disorder, 
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, insomnia, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, personality disorder, somatoform disorder, eating disorder, and 
substance use disorder. Patients with mental disorders are known to have a 
shorter life expectancy across schizophrenia, affective disorders, and other 
mental disorders than the general population; previous study verified that 
around 70% of deaths in those with mental disorders were due to physical 
diseases. If patients with mental disorders have higher risks of cardiovascular 
diseases, especially in young patients, prevention and surveillance of 
cardiovascular diseases among these young patients during their lifetime should 
be considered.A substantial number of young patients aged 20–39 years (13.1%) 
were diagnosed with mental disorders, and excessive risks of incident MI and IS 
were observed in patients with mental disorders including depressive disorder, 
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, insomnia, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, personality disorder, somatoform disorder, eating disorder, and 
substance use disorder. In contrast to previous suggestion that unfavourable 
lifestyle behaviours and poor cardiometabolic profiles could lead to increased 
cardiovascular risks, patients with mental disorders did not show unfavourable 
lifestyle behaviours or worse metabolic profiles than their counterparts.

INTRODUCTION: Severe sialorrhoea is a common, distressing problem in 
children/adolescents with neurodisabilities, which has adverse health and social 
consequences. The SALIVA trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of a paediatric-specific oral solution of glycopyrronium along with its impact 
on quality-of-life (QoL), which has been lacking from previous trials of 
sialorrhoea treatments.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase IV 
trial is ongoing in several centres across France. Eighty children aged 3-17 
years with severe sialorrhoea (≥6 on the modified Teachers Drooling Scale) 
related to chronic neurological disorders in whom non-pharmacological standard 
of care has already been implemented or has failed, will be recruited. Patients 
will be randomised 1:1 to receive a 2 mg/5 mL solution of glycopyrronium bromide 
(Sialanar 320 µg/mL glycopyrronium) or placebo three times daily during a 
3-month blinded period. After Day 84, participants will be invited into a 
6-month, open-label study extension period, where they will all receive 
glycopyrronium. The primary endpoint of the double-blind period will be the 
change from baseline to Day 84 in the Drooling Impact Scale (DIS), a validated 
measure to assess sialorrhoea. A series of secondary efficacy endpoints 
involving change in total DIS, specific DIS items and response (DIS improvement 
≥13.6 points) will be analysed in a prespecified hierarchy. QoL data will be 
collected from parents, caregivers and patients where possible using specific 
DIS questions and DISABKIDS questionnaires. Safety endpoints, including adverse 
events, will be assessed throughout the trial periods.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: In total, 87 children have been recruited and 
recruitment is now complete. Final results are expected by the end of 2023. 
Findings will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed 
journals.
