Although demographic statistics show that populations around the world are 
rapidly ageing, this rising life expectancy is accompanied by an increase in the 
number of people living with age-related chronic conditions, such as frailty, 
cognitive decline, depression, or sexual dysfunction. In men, a progressive 
decline in androgens occurs with increasing age, and low androgen levels are 
associated with age-related chronic conditions. However, androgen administration 
studies are inconclusive, showing differing results according to the androgen 
used (testosterone [T], dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]), the group of men 
examined (younger vs. older; eugonadal vs. hypogonadal) and the conditions 
studied (frailty, cognitive decline, depression, sexual dysfunction). In this 
review, the current state for the use of T and DHEA therapy in men for the 
age-related conditions is examined. Due to the progressive age-related decline 
in androgens leading to a higher rate of older men having low androgen levels, 
the effects of androgen treatment in elderly males will be of particular 
interest in this review. Dose-response relationships, the role of potential 
moderators, and the androgen treatment-related risk for adverse events will be 
discussed. Studies have suggested that T treatment - more so than DHEA treatment 
- may be an effective therapy against age-related chronic conditions in men with 
low T levels; especially older men. Such conditions include frailty, depression, 
or sexual dysfunction. However, T treatment does not emerge as an effective 
therapy against cognitive decline. Nevertheless, more high-quality, randomised 
controlled trials using T treatment for age-related chronic conditions are 
necessary if further conclusions are to be made.

Weathering, Drugs, and Whack-a-Mole: Fundamental and Proximate Causes of 
Widening Educational Inequity in U.S. Life Expectancy by Sex and Race, 
1990-2015.

Discussion of growing inequity in U.S. life expectancy increasingly focuses on 
the popularized narrative that it is driven by a surge of "deaths of despair." 
Does this narrative fit the empirical evidence? Using census and Vital 
Statistics data, we apply life-table methods to calculate cause-specific years 
of life lost between ages 25 and 84 by sex and educational rank for non-Hispanic 
blacks and whites in 1990 and 2015. Drug overdoses do contribute importantly to 
widening inequity for whites, especially men, but trivially for blacks. The 
contribution of suicide to growing inequity is unremarkable. Cardiovascular 
disease, non-lung cancers, and other internal causes are key to explaining 
growing life expectancy inequity. Results underline the speculative nature of 
attempts to attribute trends in life-expectancy inequity to an epidemic of 
despair. They call for continued investigation of the possible weathering 
effects of tenacious high-effort coping with chronic stressors on the health of 
marginalized populations.

Cost-effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori test and eradication versus upper 
gastrointestinal series versus endoscopy for gastric cancer mortality and 
outcomes in high prevalence countries.

Kowada A(1).

Author information:
(1)General Affairs Department, Ota City Office , Tokyo , Japan.

Background: The latest version of Japanese guidelines for effective secondary 
prevention of gastric cancer recommend upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) and 
endoscopy in adults 50 years of age and older. A Helicobacter pylori antibody 
test and eradication (H. pylori screening) reduces gastric cancer risk. 
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori 
screening, compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries. Methods: 
We developed decision trees with Markov models using a healthcare payer 
perspective and a lifetime horizon. Targeted populations were hypothetical 
cohorts of asymptomatic individuals at the age of 50, 60, 70 and 80 years. We 
calculated per-person costs and effectiveness with discounting at a fixed annual 
rate of 3% and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: H. 
pylori screening was cost-saving and more cost-effective for individuals at the 
age of 50, 60, 70, and 80 than UGI and endoscopy. One-way and multiway 
sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte-Carlo simulation for 10,000 
trials demonstrated that H. pylori screening was cost-effective 100% of the time 
at a willingness-to-pay level of US$50,000/QALY gained. Conclusions: H. pylori 
screening for the adults 50 years of age and older could be cost-effective 
compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries. The main reasons for 
the superiority of H. pylori screening are that an H. pylori antibody test has a 
higher sensitivity and specificity than UGI and endoscopy and the benefits to 
reduce gastric cancer incidence and mortality.

Background: The potential impact of disease management to optimize quality of 
care, health outcomes, and total healthcare costs across a range of cardiac 
disease states is unknown. Methods: A trial-based cost-utility analysis was 
conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial of 335 patients with chronic, 
non-valvular AF (without heart failure; the SAFETY Trial) discharged to home 
from three tertiary referral hospitals in Australia. A home-based disease 
management intervention (the SAFETY intervention) that involved community-based 
AF care including home visits was compared to routine primary healthcare and 
hospital outpatient follow-up (standard management). Bootstrapped incremental 
cost-utility ratios were computed based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and total healthcare costs. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were 
constructed to explore the probability of the SAFETY intervention being 
cost-effective. Sub-group analyses were performed based on age and sex to 
determine differential cost-effectiveness. Results: During median follow-up of 
1.75 years, the SAFETY intervention was associated with a non-statistically 
significant increase in QALYs (0.02 per person) and lower total healthcare costs 
(-$4,375 per person). Although each of these findings were not statistically 
significant, the SAFETY intervention was found to be dominant (more effective 
and cost saving) in 58.8% of the bootstrapped iterations and cost-effective 
(more effective and gains in QALYs achieved at or below $50,000 per QALY gained) 
in 61.5% of the iterations. Males and those aged less than 78 years achieved 
greater gains in QALYs and savings in healthcare costs. The estimated value of 
perfect information in Australia (the monetized value of removing uncertainty in 
the cost-effectiveness results) was A$51 million, thus demonstrating the high 
potential gain from further research. Conclusions: Compared with standard 
management, the SAFETY intervention is potentially a dominant strategy for those 
with chronic, non-valvular AF. However, there would be substantial value in 
reducing the uncertainty in these estimates from further research.

Population Adjustment Methods for Indirect Comparisons: A Review of National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technology Appraisals.

Bristol,Bristol,United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVES: Indirect comparisons via a common comparator (anchored comparisons) 
are commonly used in health technology assessment. However, common comparators 
may not be available, or the comparison may be biased due to differences in 
effect modifiers between the included studies. Recently proposed population 
adjustment methods aim to adjust for differences between study populations in 
the situation where individual patient data are available from at least one 
study, but not all studies. They can also be used when there is no common 
comparator or for single-arm studies (unanchored comparisons). We aim to 
characterise the use of population adjustment methods in technology appraisals 
(TAs) submitted to the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE).
METHODS: We reviewed NICE TAs published between 01/01/2010 and 20/04/2018.
RESULTS: Population adjustment methods were used in 7 percent (18/268) of TAs. 
Most applications used unanchored comparisons (89 percent, 16/18), and were in 
oncology (83 percent, 15/18). Methods used included matching-adjusted indirect 
comparisons (89 percent, 16/18) and simulated treatment comparisons (17 percent, 
3/18). Covariates were included based on: availability, expert opinion, 
effective sample size, statistical significance, or cross-validation. Larger 
treatment networks were commonplace (56 percent, 10/18), but current methods 
cannot account for this. Appraisal committees received results of 
population-adjusted analyses with caution and typically looked for greater cost 
effectiveness to minimise decision risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Population adjustment methods are becoming increasingly common in 
NICE TAs, although their impact on decisions has been limited to date. Further 
research is needed to improve upon current methods, and to investigate their 
properties in simulation studies.

BACKGROUND: Retropharyngeal hematoma following cervical spine trauma may lead to 
life-threatening upper airway obstruction and difficult airway management. This 
retrospective study was performed to investigate whether the extension of 
retropharyngeal space (RPS) was associated with difficult intubation by direct 
laryngoscopy in traumatic cervical spine injury.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients who had undergone direct endotracheal 
intubation under general anesthesia for cervical spine surgery were 
retrospectively identified. Laryngoscopic grade by Cormack-Lehane (C-L) 
classification was collected; grade 1 or 2 was categorized as easy laryngoscopy, 
whereas grade 3 or 4 was categorized as difficult laryngoscopy. In these 
patients, RPS thickness and the proportions of RPS to the vertebral bodies were 
measured at the 2nd, 5th and 7th cervical spine levels using magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. Measures of RPS were compared between easy 
and difficult laryngoscopy. Relationships between measures of RPS and difficult 
laryngoscopy were analyzed with logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: RPS thickness at C2 was significantly greater in difficult laryngoscopy 
(median 14.29 mm, IQR: 9.75-18.04) than easy laryngoscopy (median 5.10, IQR: 
4.33-5.94, p<0.001). Proportion of RPS to the C2 vertebral body were 
significantly higher in difficult laryngoscopy than in easy laryngoscopy 
(p<0.001). RPS thickness and the proportion of RPS to the vertebral body were 
significantly associated with difficult laryngoscopy (OR=2.13, 95% CI: 
1.38-3.30; p<0.001 and OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21; p<0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: RPS extension at the upper cervical spine level is associated with 
difficult direct laryngoscopy in traumatic cervical spine injury.

Thanks to the progress in early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the life 
expectancy of cancer patients has now increased. Patients are, therefore, more 
likely to experience their individual cancer pain as a chronic pain. As a 
consequence, long-term treatment of cancer-related pain and oncological 
therapy-related pain are a major need for all patients and a challenge to all 
healthcare professionals. Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic drug 
characterized by two synergistic mechanisms of action, since it acts at the 
µ-opioid receptor (MOR) and inhibits noradrenalin re-uptake (NRI). Therefore, 
tapentadol has been considered the first of a new class of drugs, MOR-NRI. 
Tapentadol has been tested in different populations of cancer patients 
(opioid-naive and -pretreated), such as those with pain of mixed etiology, 
patients with pain from hematological malignancies and patients experiencing 
pain conditions due to anticancer treatment. According to available evidence, 
tapentadol prolonged release was well tolerated and effective in cancer pain 
patients. In randomized, double-blind and active-controlled trials it proved 
non-inferior to standard opioids like morphine or oxycodone in the management of 
moderate-to-severe cancer pain, both in opioid-naive and in opioid-pretreated 
patients. The good analgesic efficacy may be partly due to the action of 
tapentadol on neuropathic pain components. Together with the low rate of 
gastrointestinal adverse effects and the overall favorable safety profile, 
tapentadol can be considered a good option in cancer pain patients, who can 
suffer frequently from nausea, vomiting, constipation or other events that 
further reduce their quality of life.

Extension of the Storage Period of Platelet Concentrates in Germany to 5 Days by 
Bacterial Testing: Is it Worth the Effort?

Oeynhausen, Germany.

The shelf life of platelet concentrates (PCs) was limited in Germany to 4 days 
after the day of production because platelet-related septic complications had 
been observed, mainly with PCs at the end of their shelf life. The reduction in 
PC shelf life gives rise to several problems, including an increased number of 
discarded products, accompanied by potential challenges of how to ensure an 
adequate supply of platelet products. The aim of this study was to show routine 
experience over the last 7 years using the Bactiflow (BF) assay to screen for 
bacterial contamination late in PC storage, followed by extension of PC shelf 
life.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 23 
million people worldwide. It is considered the eighth leading cause of 
disability according to the World Health Organization and is associated with a 
significant reduction in life expectancy. Antipsychotics represent the 
first-choice treatment in SCZ, but approximately 30% of patients fail to respond 
to acute treatment. These patients are generally defined as treatment-resistant 
and are eligible for clozapine treatment. Treatment-resistant patients show a 
more severe course of the disease, but it has been suggested that 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) may constitute a distinct phenotype that 
is more than just a more severe form of SCZ. TRS is heritable, and genetics has 
been shown to play an important role in modulating response to antipsychotics. 
Important efforts have been put into place in order to better understand the 
genetic architecture of TRS, with the main goal of identifying reliable 
predictive markers that might improve the management and quality of life of TRS 
patients. However, the number of candidate gene and genome-wide association 
studies specifically focused on TRS is limited, and to date, findings do not 
allow the disentanglement of its polygenic nature. More recent studies 
implemented polygenic risk score, gene-based and machine learning methods to 
explore the genetics of TRS, reporting promising findings. In this review, we 
present an overview on the genetics of TRS, particularly focusing our discussion 
on studies implementing polygenic approaches.

A decade ago, major public health differences between two neighboring, equal 
sized large Swedish cities, Norrköping and Linköping (»the Twin cities«) were 
revealed. These differences were considerable for cardiovascular mortality and 
life expectancy. An important finding was that cardiovascular mortality rates 
for men and women in the city of Norrköping were highest compared to other major 
Swedish cities. In this follow-up, a decade later, cardiovascular mortality 
rates are still highest for the Norrköping population in comparison to the 
largest Swedish cities. There are also still profound and major public health 
differences between these twin cities. The differences seem to persist over 
time. These differences could not be explained by differences in health care, 
but are rather reflecting different social history and socioeconomic and life 
style differences in these two cities.

Given the setting of Stockholm County, a recently published health-economic 
analysis shows that the cost per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of a free TBE 
vaccinations program is below generally acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds 
in Sweden. A report from the Public Health Agency (PHA), based on similar input 
data, shows that it is not cost effective to subsidize TBE vaccination in the 
Stockholm county. The main difference in the two analyses is the time horizon 
for the analyses; a life-time perspective versus 10-year perspective. Health 
economics of vaccination strategies should be based on a long time perspective 
and especially when the disease is more severe in older adults, i.e. TBE. 
Health-care decision-makers should be aware of the importance of the time 
horizon for the results when considering these evaluations in prioritization 
decisions. With a life-time perspective a TBE-vaccination program appears 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is frequently 
used for palliative treatment of patients with incurable esophageal cancer, the 
optimal schedule for symptom control is unknown. This retrospective study 
evaluated three EBRT schedules for symptom control and investigated possible 
prognostic factors associated with second intervention and overall survival 
(OS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with esophageal cancer treated with EBRT with 
palliative intent between January 2009 and December 2015 were evaluated. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models estimated the effect of 
treatment schedule (20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 39 Gy in 13 
fractions) on OS. To study the effect of prognostic factors on time to second 
intervention (repeat EBRT, intraluminal brachytherapy or stent placement) a 
competing risk model with death as competing event was used.
RESULTS: 205 patients received 20 Gy (31%), 30 Gy (38%) or 39 Gy (32%). 
Improvement of symptoms was observed in 72% with no differences between 
schedules. Median OS after 20 Gy, 30 Gy and 39 Gy was 4.6 months (95%CI 
2.6-6.6), 5.2 months (95%CI 3.7-6.7) and 9.7 months (95%CI 6.9-12.5), 
respectively. Poor performance status (HR 2.25 (95%CI 1.53-3.29)), recurrent 
esophageal cancer (HR 1.69 (95%CI 1.15-2.47)) and distant metastasis (HR 1.73 
(95%CI 1.27-2.35)) were significantly related to worse OS. Treatment with 30 Gy 
and 39 Gy was related to longer time to second intervention compared to 20 Gy 
(adjusted cause specific HR 0.50 (95%CI 0.25-0.99) and 0.27 (95%CI 0.13-0.56), 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative EBRT provides good symptom control in patients with 
symptomatic esophageal cancer. A higher dose schedule was related to a longer 
time to second intervention. Hence, selection based on life expectancy is vital 
to prevent unnecessary long treatment schedules in patients with expected short 
survival, and limit the chance of second intervention when life expectancy is 
longer.

The ability of a rhizosphere-derived microbial product (composed of a consortium 
of a strain of Bacillus subtilis and a strain of Trichoderma harzianum) to 
suppress common scab disease in potato caused by Streptomyces spp. was examined 
over a two-year period. Relative to the condition in which 0 kg·ha-1 of the 
designated microbial product was applied (control), the disease index decreased 
by 30.6%-46.1%, and yield increased by 23.0%-32.2% in treatments in which 225 or 
300 kg·ha-1 of the microbial product was administered, respectively. The 
bacterial communities present in the rhizosphere were assessed at an early stage 
of tuber formation, a time at which tubers are susceptible to common scab. 
Potato plants in which soils were treated with 225 or 300 kg·ha-1 of the 
microbial product harbored rhizospheric microbiota with lower α-diversity and an 
increased relative abundance of taxa representing the beneficial bacteria. In 
summary, a select microbial product composed of a consortium of Bacillus 
subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum effectively suppressed common scab disease 
and increased tuber yield by establishing a high relative abundance of 
beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere.

The paired-type homeodomain transcription factor Uncx is involved in multiple 
processes of embryogenesis in vertebrates. Reasoning that zebrafish genes 
uncx4.1 and uncx are orthologs of mouse Uncx, we studied their genomic 
environment and developmental expression. Evolutionary analyses indicate the 
zebrafish uncx genes as being paralogs deriving from teleost-specific 
whole-genome duplication. Whole-mount in situ mRNA hybridization of uncx 
transcripts in zebrafish embryos reveals novel expression domains, confirms 
those previously known, and suggests sub-functionalization of paralogs. Using 
genetic mutants and pharmacological inhibitors, we investigate the role of 
signaling pathways on the expression of zebrafish uncx genes in developing 
somites. In identifying putative functional role(s) of zebrafish uncx genes, we 
hypothesized that they encode transcription factors that coordinate growth and 
innervation of somitic muscles.

Knee pain has been reported to limit mobility and impair quality of life in 25% 
of adults. Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is one of the many different causes 
of lateral knee pain. It was first seen in US Marine Corps recruits during their 
training in 1975 and has been diagnosed frequently in long-distance runners, 
cyclists, skiers, and participants of hockey, basketball, and soccer since then. 
These activities all depend on rapid and prolonged cycling of the knee through 
flexion and extension. This article will discuss how this cycling can cause the 
syndrome, as well as, discuss evaluation and treatment modalities.  The 
iliotibial band (ITB) is the distal fascial continuation of the tensor fascia 
lata, gluteus medius, and gluteal maximus. It traverses superficial to the 
vastus lateralis and inserts on the Gerdy tubercle of the lateral tibial plateau 
and partially to the supracondylar ridge of the lateral femur. There is also an 
anterior extension called the iliopatella band that connects the lateral patella 
and prevents medial translation of the patella. The ITB functions as a knee 
extensor when the knee is less than 30 degrees of flexion but becomes a knee 
flexor after exceeding 30 degrees of flexion. The ITB has been postulated to 
acquire a more posterior position relative to the lateral femoral epicondyle 
with increasing degrees of flexion.

    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021 Dec 10;12:CD013079.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) a life-limiting inherited disease affecting a 
number of organs, but classically associated with chronic lung infection and 
progressive loss of lung function. Chronic infection by Burkholderia cepacia 
complex (BCC) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and therefore 
represents a significant challenge to clinicians treating people with CF. This 
review examines the current evidence for long-term antibiotic therapy in people 
with CF and chronic BCC infection.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the effects of long-term 
oral and inhaled antibiotic therapy targeted against chronic BCC lung infections 
in people with CF. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of treatments 
in terms of improvements in lung function and reductions in exacerbation rate. 
Secondary objectives include quantifying adverse events, mortality and changes 
in quality of life associated with treatment.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the 
reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of last search: 29 May 
2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of long-term antibiotic 
therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed 
risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included one RCT (100 participants) which lasted 52 weeks 
comparing continuous inhaled aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and placebo in a 
double-blind RCT for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week open-label extension and a 
four-week follow-up period. The average participant age was 26.3 years, 61% were 
male and average lung function was 56.5% predicted.Treatment with AZLI for 24 
weeks was not associated with improvement in forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV1), mean difference 0.91% (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.15 to 
4.97) (moderate-quality evidence). The median time to the next exacerbation was 
75 days in the AZLI group compared to 51 days in the placebo group, but the 
difference was not significant (P = 0.27) (moderate-quality evidence). 
Similarly, the number of participants hospitalised for respiratory exacerbations 
showed no difference between groups, risk ratio (RR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.45) 
(moderate-quality evidence). Overall adverse events were similar between groups, 
RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.19) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no 
significant differences between treatment groups in relation to mortality 
(moderate-quality evidence), quality of life or sputum density.In relation to 
methodological quality, the overall risk of bias in the study was assessed to be 
unclear to low risk.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence from the literature to 
determine an effective strategy for antibiotic therapy for treating chronic BCC 
infection.

OBJECTIVES: An educational healthcare circuit (EHC) is proposed with the 
objective of preventing weight recovery of patients after bariatric surgery 
through education and lifestyle change. The objective of this study was to 
measure the viability of the EHC (shared medical appointments [SMAs] combined 
with bariatric surgery) through cost-effectiveness analysis. The EHC presented 
in this study is innovative because it offers a multidisciplinary approach based 
on medical, psychological and dietetic expertise to combat obesity. The strategy 
is to give the patient a diagnosis and then a personalised follow-up.
STUDY DESIGN: A mathematical model based on a decision tree (1 year) and a 
Markov model (10 years) to measure the efficiency and cost of an EHC in 
comparison with the customary care offered in France were built.
METHODS: The effects of the EHC were observed for the prevalence of type 2 
diabetes and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The chosen financial 
perspective is from the point of view of the French social security system.
RESULTS: The EHC records an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of € 
48,315.43 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over a 1-year horizon and € 
28,283.77 per QALY over 10 years (with discount rate of 8%: € 25,362.85 per 
QALY).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that an EHC is more expensive yet more effective 
than usual care. That is, in the short term, the costs are high, but at 10 
years, the treatment is cost-effective, representing a feasible alternative for 
those patients who qualify for bariatric surgery in France.

This study firstly explored the risks of secondary cancer in healthy organs of 
Chinese paediatric patients with brain tumours after boron neutron capture 
therapy (BNCT). Three neutron beam irradiation geometries (i.e. right lateral, 
top to bottom, posterior to anterior) were adopted in treating patients with 
brain tumours under the clinical environment of BNCT. The concerned organs in 
this study were those with high cancer morbidity in China (e.g. lung, liver and 
stomach). The equivalent doses for these organs were calculated using Monte 
Carlo and anthropomorphic paediatric phantoms with Chinese physiological 
features. The risk of secondary cancer, characterised by the lifetime 
attributable risk (LAR) factor given in the BEIR VII report, was compared among 
the three irradiation geometries. The results showed that the LAR was lower with 
the PA irradiation geometry than with the two other irradiation geometries when 
the 2 cm diameter tumour was at a depth of 6 cm on the right side of the brain. 
Under the PA irradiation geometry, the LAR in the organs increased with 
increasing tumour volume and depth because of the long irradiation time. As the 
patients aged from 10-15 years old, the LAR decreased, which was related to the 
increased patient height and shortened life expectancy. Female patients had a 
relatively higher risk of secondary cancer than male patients in this study, 
which could be due to the thinner body thickness and the weaker protective 
effect on the internal organs of the female patients. In conclusion, the risks 
of secondary cancer in organs were related to irradiation geometries, gender, 
and age, indicating that the risk of secondary cancer is a personalised 
parameter that needs to be evaluated before administering BNCT, especially in 
patients with large or deep tumours.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to report on the design of a model to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of early psychosis (PsyMod) and 
to estimate ten-year cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interventions 
targeting individuals with ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis or with 
first episode psychosis (FEP).
METHODS: PsyMod was built in parallel with the development of a new standard of 
care for treatment of early psychosis in the Netherlands. PsyMod is a 
state-transition cohort simulation model and considers six health states, namely 
ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), FEP, post-FEP, no-UHR, recovery/remission, 
and death. Results are expressed as total healthcare costs, QALYs, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and budget impact.
RESULTS: PsyMod was used to extrapolate budget impact and cost-effectiveness of 
cognitive behavioural therapy for preventing FEP for individuals at UHR of 
psychosis (CBTuhr) compared to care as usual. CBTuhr resulted in a per-patient 
increase of 0.06 QALYs and a per patient cost reduction of €654 (dominant ICER) 
with a reduction in 5-year healthcare costs of €1,002,166.
CONCLUSIONS: PsyMod can be used to examine cost-effectiveness and budget impact 
of interventions targeting prevention and treatment of FEP and is freely 
available for academic purposes upon request by the authors.

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease(AD) has gained momentum in 
recent years. One of the concerns over its application pertains to 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) from population average and specific subgroup 
differences, as such a therapy is imperative for health decisionmakers to 
allocate limited resources. However, this sort of CEA model considering 
heterogeneous population with risk factors adjustment has been rarely addressed.
METHODS: We aimed to show the heterogeneity of CEA in immunotherapy for AD in 
comparison with the comparator without intervention. Economic evaluation was 
performed via incremental Cost- Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and 
Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) in terms of the Quality- Adjusted 
Life Years (QALY). First, population-average CEA was performed with and without 
adjustment for age and gender. Secondly, sub-group CEA was performed with the 
stratification of gender and age based on Markov process.
RESULTS: Given the threshold of $20,000 of willingness to pay, the results of 
ICER without and with adjustment for age and gender revealed similar results 
($14,691/QALY and $17,604/QALY). The subgroup ICER results by different age 
groups and gender showed substantial differences. The CEAC showed that the 
probability of being cost-effective was only 48.8%-53.3% in terms of QALY at 
population level but varied from 83.5% in women aged 50-64 years, following 
women aged 65-74 years and decreased to 0.2% in men≥ 75 years.
CONCLUSION: There were considerable heterogeneities observed in the CEA of 
vaccination for AD. As with the development of personalized medicine, the CEA 
results assessed by health decision-maker should not only be considered by 
population-average level but also specific sub-group levels.

OBJECTIVE: Demoralization is an existential distress syndrome that consists of 
an incapacity of coping, helplessness, hopelessness, loss of meaning and 
purpose, and impaired self-esteem. It can affect cancer patients, and the 
Demoralization Scale is a valid instrument to assess it. The present study aimed 
to investigate the prevalence of demoralization in end-of-life cancer patients 
and its associations with the medical and psychosocial variables. In addition, 
the latent dimensions of demoralization emerging in this distinctive population 
were explored.
METHOD: The study is cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 235 end-of-life 
cancer patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) lower than 50 and a 
life expectancy of a few weeks. For each patient, personal and medical data was 
gathered by a palliative physician and a set of validated rating scales, 
assessing demoralization, anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, pain, 
spiritual well-being, and dignity, was administered by a psychologist during the 
first consultation.
RESULT: Sixty-four participants (27.2%) had low demoralization, 50.2% (n = 118) 
had medium demoralization, and 22.6% (n = 53) had high demoralization. Factor 
analysis evidenced a five-factor solution that identified the following 
demoralization factors: Emotional Distress and Inability to Cope, Loss of 
Purpose and Meaning, Worthlessness, Sense of Failure, and Dysphoria. All the 
considered variables were associated with demoralization, except for pain, 
nausea, breathing problems, and sociodemographic and clinical variables.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: End-of-life cancer patients showed higher levels of 
demoralization than has been reported in other studies with advanced cancer. 
These data could suggest that demoralization could increase in proximity to 
death and with impaired clinical condition. In particular, the five 
demoralization dimensions that emerged could represent the typical concerns 
around which the syndrome evolves in end-of-life cancer patients. Finally, 
spiritual well-being could play a protective role with respect to 
demoralization.
