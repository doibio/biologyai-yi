HR 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.97) and 3-4: HR 0.79 (95% CI 
0.71-0.88) recommendations. There was no trend with CVD risk, but a 
significantly lower risk of fatal CVD with 3-4 recommendations: HR 0.78 (95% CI 
0.61-0.98). Meeting more recommendations resulted in significant cross-sectional 
trends (Ptrend < 0.001) towards lower body fat, waist circumference, LDL 
cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase, gamma 
glutammyltransferase, and hs-CRP, but higher glucose and aspartate 
aminotransferase.
CONCLUSIONS: Meeting dietary recommendations is associated with additive 
reductions in premature mortality. Motivating and supporting people to adhere to 
dietary guidelines may help extend years of healthy life expectancy.

PURPOSE: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hearing loss (HL) 
affects up to 15% of the world's adult population. Coping and personality are 
hypothesized to underlie quality of life (QoL) and distress scores. We aimed to 
study the importance of personality and coping in persons with HL for 
self-reported hearing disability, QoL, and distress.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out, including one hundred and 
fifty-eight adults seeking hearing aids. Pure-tone average hearing thresholds 
(PTA) were determined for each ear. A revised version of the Abbreviated Profile 
of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) served as a measure of self-reported hearing 
disability. Further, the generic part of the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment (EORTC) QoL questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire 
(GHQ) (distress measure) were answered. Levels of neuroticism and the 
Theoretically Originated Measure of the Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress 
(TOMCATS) coping expectancy were determined.
RESULTS: Hearing disability was determined by PTA (better ear) and level of 
neuroticism. Distress and QoL were determined by neuroticism and coping.
CONCLUSION: More neuroticism was associated with worse outcome for the variables 
hearing disability, distress, and QoL. Helplessness and hopelessness were 
associated with worse hearing disability, increased distress, and lowered QoL. 
Patient reported hearing disability was also associated with PTA (better ear). 
There is a need to investigate further the associations between hearing 
disability and QoL to psychosocial parameters.

BACKGROUND: The United Nations acknowledged diabetes as an epidemic of the 21st 
century. Global trends demonstrate a continuing growth in its prevalence at 
approximately 2.5 % per year. The aim of the study was to analyse selected 
epidemiological factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Poland, Central Europe 
and the World.
METHODS: This study presents Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. Study 
describes the type 2 diabetes burden in the studied populations based on years 
lived with disability (YLD), years of life lost (YLL), and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to be a determinant of reduced 
life expectancy, as in the analysed period the condition presented an increasing 
trend, compared to other diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: In recent years the observed YLL, YLD and DALY values for type 2 
diabetes have been comparable to the expected ones. Thus the prognosis presented 
by GBD may be used as a reliable source of information and a basis for a health 
policy that reduces the number of patients with diabetes and related 
complications, comorbidities or mortality.

BACKGROUND: The chronic effects of ozone have only rarely been investigated in 
disease burden studies to date. Our goal was to determine this disease burden in 
Germany over the period 2007-2016, with particular attention to estimation based 
on effect estimates adjusted for particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2).
METHODS: The nationwide, high-spatial-resolution (2 km × 2 km), population-based 
exposure to ozone in the summer months ("summer ozone") was calculated on the 
basis of modeled ozone data and population counts in Germany. Next, risk 
estimates derived from cohort studies were used to quantify the burden of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data on population counts, life 
expectancy, and mortality in Germany were used to reflect the situation across 
the country as accurately as possible.
RESULTS: The estimates of years of life lost (YLL) due to summer ozone ranged 
from 18.33 per 100 000 people (95% confidence interval [14.02; 22.08]) in 2007 
to 35.77 per 100 000 people [27.45; 42.98] in 2015. These findings indicate that 
ozone affects the COPD burden independently of other harmful components of the 
air. No clear secular trend in the COPD burden can be seen over the period 2007 
to 2016.
CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to ozone contributes to the COPD burden among the 
general population in Germany. As climate change may lead to a rise in the ozone 
concentration, more intensive research is required on the effects of ozone on 
health.

The normal development and maturation of oocytes and sperm, the formation of 
fertilized ova, the implantation of early embryos, and the growth and 
development of foetuses are the biological basis of mammalian reproduction. 
Therefore, research on oocytes has always occupied a very important position in 
the life sciences and reproductive medicine fields. Various embryo engineering 
technologies for oocytes, early embryo formation and subsequent developmental 
stages and different target sites, such as gene editing, intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI), preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and somatic cell 
nuclear transfer (SCNT) technologies, have all been established and widely used 
in industrialization. However, as research continues to deepen and target 
species become more advanced, embryo engineering technology has also been 
developing in a more complex and sophisticated direction. At the same time, the 
success rate also shows a declining trend, resulting in an extension of the 
research and development cycle and rising costs. By studying the existing embryo 
engineering technology process, we discovered three critical nodes that have the 
greatest impact on the development of oocytes and early embryos, namely, oocyte 
micromanipulation, oocyte electrical activation/reconstructed embryo 
electrofusion, and the in vitro culture of early embryos. This article mainly 
demonstrates the efforts made by researchers in the relevant technologies of 
these three critical nodes from an engineering perspective, analyses the 
shortcomings of the current technology, and proposes a plan and prospects for 
the development of embryo engineering technology in the future.

BACKGROUND: SCOT was an international, randomized phase 3 trial of 3 months vs 
6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine in 
patients with colorectal cancer. We sought patients' preferences for 3 months vs 
6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy in the SCOT trial.
METHODS: SCOT participants from Australia and New Zealand completed a validated 
questionnaire (at 3 and 18 months) to elicit the minimum survival benefits 
judged necessary to make an extra 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy worthwhile, 
based on their experience. Standardized hypothetical scenarios used the 
following baseline survivals (with 3 months of chemotherapy): life expectancies 
(LE) of 5 years and 15 years and 5-year survival rates (5YS) of 65% and 85%.
RESULTS: Of the 160 participants, 82 were assigned 3 months adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and 78 were assigned 6 months. Adjuvant chemotherapy was FOLFOX in 
121 (75.6%) and XELOX in 39 (24.4%). Preferences varied substantially and did 
not differ according to treatment group. The median survival benefits judged 
necessary to make the extra 3 months of chemotherapy worthwhile were an extra 
3 years beyond a LE of 5 years; 3 years beyond a LE of 15 years; 15% beyond a 
5YS of 65%; and 5% beyond a 5YS of 85%. Preferences were similar at 3 months and 
18 months. Preferences were not predicted by participants' baseline 
characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Preferences varied substantially, and the benefits many required to 
warrant an extra 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy were larger than the benefits 
of an extra 3 months of chemotherapy calculated in the International Duration 
Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) meta-analysis.

Resection of the inferior vena cava may be required in the courses of 
oncological surgeries for the tumors originating from or invading it. Management 
of the remaining defect depends on the extension of the resection. Partial or 
complete replacement of the inferior vena cava, with a patch or interposition 
graft, may be required. Standard techniques for the reconstruction with a 
prosthetic material or the autologous veins can be associated with the 
prosthetic graft infection, high cost, long-standing anticoagulation, technical 
difficulties, and/or need for extra incisions. The use of the autologous 
peritoneum represents an easy and inexpensive alternative for the partial and 
complete inferior vena cava reconstructions.

Life expectancy is increasing globally, with the biggest gains expected in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Using an online survey, we investigated the perspectives of 
gerontology scholars on the challenges of aging in sub-Saharan Africa as well as 
the assets of older adults. Respondents (n = 72) from 17 countries, primarily in 
Africa, and representing 16 disciplines, identified the top issues facing 
African older adults as: poverty, lack of trained geriatric professionals, food 
insecurity, disability/health issues, and long-term care. Older adults' unique 
strengths were noted as indigenous knowledge systems, being holders of cultural 
heritage, and their contributions to development. Respondents' biggest concerns 
about older adults in sub-Saharan Africa were the lack of government attention 
to aging issues (63%) and a lack of social services targeted to older adults' 
needs (57%). Government funding (77.8%) and international partnerships (38.9%) 
were noted as resources needed to support aging research in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The response or non-response of governments in sub-Saharan Africa will determine 
whether the growing number of older adults will increasingly experience unmet 
needs and whether their assets will be considered in development efforts. 
Establishing professional networks of gerontology scholars in the region will 
help to document the challenges faced by older adults, to plan for the coming 
demographic shift, and to empower older adults to thrive as valued community 
members.

The mortality experience for the cluster of US counties in the US-Mexico border 
region has not been well described. We calculated 2016-18 life expectancy for 
the border region (counties within 100 kilometers of the border), making key 
comparisons to the US overall and to nonborder counties in border states. Life 
expectancy from birth for the border region was 81.1 years, which was greater 
than for the US and for the nonborder counties of border states. However, the 
disparity in life expectancy between racial/ethnic subgroups in the border 
region was also greater, within a range of more than thirteen years. Although 
White, Black, and Asian residents of the border region could expect to live 
significantly longer than residents of the US and nonborder counties of border 
states, Hispanic and American Indian residents could not. Understanding the 
mortality experience via life expectancy can help public health professionals 
and leaders prioritize efforts to ensure that all border residents have an equal 
opportunity to live a long, healthy life.

Capsanthin is the main carotenoid compound in red paprika (Capsicum annuum L.). 
However, little is known about the beneficial effects of capsanthin in 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, the hepatoprotective 
activity of capsanthin was investigated in a mouse model of NAFLD. 
Apolipoprotein-E knockout mice were fed with normal diet, Western-type diet (WD, 
NAFLD model), WD with capsanthin (0.5 mg/kg of body weight/day, CAP), WD with 
capsanthin-rich extract (25 mg/kg of body weight/day; CRE), or WD with red 
paprika powder (25 mg/kg of body weight/day, RPP) for 12 weeks. The carotenoid 
content in CRE or RPP was analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography. 
The capsanthin concentration in CRE was 2067 mg/100 g of dry weight, which was 
63% of total carotenoids. The oral administration of CRE or capsanthin 
significantly reduced the WD-induced increase in body weight and lipid 
accumulation in the liver (vs. the RPP group). In addition, CRE or capsanthin 
significantly inhibited the WD-induced increase in cholesterol and low-density 
lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, CRE or capsanthin showed reduced levels of 
plasma alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST, respectively), 
suggesting a steatohepatitis protective effect. Capsanthin regulated mRNA levels 
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα), carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a), acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), and sterol 
regulatory element binding protein-1c (Srebp1c), which are associated with 
hepatic fatty acid metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that the capsanthin 
of red paprika plays a protective role against hepatic steatosis/steatohepatitis 
in NAFLD.

BACKGROUND: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, several mental health care 
providers were obliged to shut down outpatient services, including group therapy 
and psychoeducational sessions. The lockdown in many countries is a serious 
threat to people's mental well-being, especially for individuals with severe 
mental illnesses. Discontinued outpatient treatments and disruption of daily 
routines are considered to be risk factors for destabilization of patients with 
mental illness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, usability, 
and feasibility of a group chat program to replace cancelled face-to-face group 
sessions in an outpatient psychiatric department.
METHODS: Participants (N=33) were recruited in the outpatient department of a 
large university medical center in Leipzig, Germany. Former face-to-face group 
participants were invited to take part in a therapist-guided group-chat for 4 
weeks (8 sessions) and were asked to evaluate the program via self-administered 
standardized questionnaires at baseline (T0, preintervention), after every chat 
session (T1), and posttreatment (T2, after 4-6 weeks). The chat groups were 
specific to the following mental disorder diagnoses and based on the same 
therapeutic principles and techniques as the former face-to-face groups: 
anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and adult 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sociodemographic measures, 
attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9), quality of life (abbreviated World Health Organization Quality 
of Life assessment), treatment credibility/expectancy (Credibility Expectancy 
Questionnaire), and participants' satisfaction (Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire-8 [ZUF-8]) were measured.
RESULTS: Participants joined an average of 5 out of 8 offered chat sessions. 
Participation rates in the respective groups were highest in the ADHD group 
(8.6/11, 78%) and lowest in the anxiety group (3.7/9, 41%). The overall 
preintervention level of depressive symptoms was moderate and showed a slight, 
nonsignificant improvement at posttreatment (T0: mean 10.7, SD 5.5; T2: mean 
10.2, SD 5.5). A similar result was observed regarding quality of life (T0: 
median 41.7-68.8; T2: median 50-70.3). Treatment credibility and expectancy 
scores were medium-high (T0: meancredibility 18.1, SD 3.8; meanexpectancy 11.2, 
SD 5.1; T2: meancredibility 17.1, SD 4.8; meanexpectancy 10.3, SD 5.8). Further, 
significant correlations were detected between posttreatment expectancy score 
and posttreatment PHQ-9 score (r=-0.41, P=.02), posttreatment physical quality 
of life (r=0.54, P=.001), and posttreatment psychological quality of life 
(r=0.53, P=.002). Overall, participants' satisfaction with the program was very 
high, both after chat sessions and at posttreatment (ZUF-8: mean score 20.6, SD 
1.0). Of all participants, a majority (27/31, 87%) rated the program as 
excellent/good and indicated they would recommend the group chat program to a 
friend in need of similar help (23/31, 74%).
CONCLUSIONS: A therapist-guided group chat program to substitute outpatient 
group setting treatment during the COVID-19 lockdown was shown to be feasible, 
usable, and highly acceptable for participants. Web-based programs such as this 
one provide an easy-to-implement tool to successfully stabilize participants 
during a difficult time, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The close relationship between sleep regulation and cardiovascular 
events is one of the main focuses of research in contemporary medicine. Sleep 
habits and characteristics interfere with the cardiac rhythm and also with life 
expectancy, especially in the elderly.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of death and cardiovascular events in 
community-dwelling elderly individuals complaining of insomnia and excessive 
daytime sleepiness over eight years of follow-up.
METHOD: A prospective cohort was designed with 160 elderly, with the first wave 
occurring in 2009 and the second in 2017. Follow-up groups were determined by 
exposure or not to complaints of primary insomnia and excessive daytime 
sleepiness with or without snoring. The covariates gender, marital status, 
depression, hypertension and diabetes were controlled. The primary outcome was 
death and the secondary outcome was cardio-cerebrovascular events (CCV). Outcome 
risks were estimated by relative risk (RR) through Poisson regression, adopting 
α≤0.05.
RESULTS: There were 40 (25.97%: 19.04-32.89) deaths over the period and 48 
(30.76%: 23.52-38.01) CCV. Men had a higher risk (RR = 1.88; 1.01-3.50) of 
death. Depression (RR = 2.04; 1.06-3.89), insomnia severity (RR = 2.39; 
1.52-4.56) and sleep latency between 16-30 minutes (RR = 3, 54; 1.26-9.94) and 
31-60 minutes (RR = 2.23; 1.12-4.47) increased the risk of death independently 
in community-dwelling elderly. CCV were predicted only in the hypertensive and / 
or diabetic elderly (RR = 8.30; 1.98-34.82).
CONCLUSION: Mortality in the elderly is influenced by the emotional state and 
difficulty in falling asleep, unlike CCVs, which are conditioned only by 
arterial and metabolic blood pressure conditions.

Publisher: FUNDAMENTO: A íntima relação entre a regulação do sono e os eventos 
cardiovasculares é um dos principais focos de investigação na medicina 
contemporânea. Hábitos e características do sono interferem na ritmicidade 
cardíaca e também na expectativa de vida, principalmente em idosos.
OBJETIVO: Estimar o risco de óbito e de eventos cardiovasculares em idosos 
comunitários que apresentam queixa de insônia e sonolência excessiva diurna ao 
longo de oito anos de seguimento.
MÉTODO: Foi desenhada uma coorte prospectiva com 160 idosos, a primeira onda em 
2009 e a segunda em 2017. Os grupos de seguimento foram determinados pela 
exposição ou não às queixas de insônia primária e a sonolência excessiva diurna, 
com ou sem ronco. As covariáveis sexo, estado conjugal, depressão, hipertensão e 
diabetes foram controladas. O desfecho primário foi o óbito e o secundário, os 
eventos cardiocerebrovasculares (ECV). As probabilidades dos desfechos foram 
estimadas pelo risco relativo (RR), através da regressão de Poisson, adotando-se 
α ≤ 0,05.
RESULTADOS: Registraram-se 40 mortes no período (25,97%:19,04-32,89) e 48 ECVs 
(30,76%:23,52-38,01). Os homens apresentaram maior risco (RR = 1,88;1,01-3,50) 
de óbito. A depressão (RR = 2,04;1,06-3,89), a gravidade da insônia (RR = 
2,39;1,52-4,56) e a latência do sono entre 16-30 minutos (RR = 3,54;1,26-9,94) e 
31-60 minutos (RR = 2,23;1,12-4,47) aumentaram independentemente o risco de 
óbito em idosos comunitários. Os ECVs foram preditos apenas por idosos 
hipertensos e/ou diabéticos (RR = 8,30; 1,98-34,82).
CONCLUSÃO: A mortalidade em idosos é influenciada pelo estado emocional e pela 
dificuldade de dormir, diferentemente dos ECVs, condicionados apenas pelas 
condições pressóricas arteriais e metabólicas.

BACKGROUND: The close relationship between sleep regulation and cardiovascular 
events is one of the main focuses of research in contemporary medicine. Sleep 
habits and characteristics interfere with the cardiac rhythm and also with life 
expectancy, especially in the elderly.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of death and cardiovascular events in 
community-dwelling elderly individuals complaining of insomnia and excessive 
daytime sleepiness over eight years of follow-up.
METHOD: A prospective cohort was designed with 160 elderly, with the first wave 
occurring in 2009 and the second in 2017. Follow-up groups were determined by 
exposure or not to complaints of primary insomnia and excessive daytime 
sleepiness with or without snoring. The covariates gender, marital status, 
depression, hypertension and diabetes were controlled. The primary outcome was 
death and the secondary outcome was cardio-cerebrovascular events (CCV). Outcome 
risks were estimated by relative risk (RR) through Poisson regression, adopting 
α≤0.05.
RESULTS: There were 40 (25.97%: 19.04-32.89) deaths over the period and 48 
(30.76%: 23.52-38.01) CCV. Men had a higher risk (RR = 1.88; 1.01-3.50) of 
death. Depression (RR = 2.04; 1.06-3.89), insomnia severity (RR = 2.39; 
1.52-4.56) and sleep latency between 16-30 minutes (RR = 3, 54; 1.26-9.94) and 
31-60 minutes (RR = 2.23; 1.12-4.47) increased the risk of death independently 
in community-dwelling elderly. CCV were predicted only in the hypertensive and / 
or diabetic elderly (RR = 8.30; 1.98-34.82).
CONCLUSION: Mortality in the elderly is influenced by the emotional state and 
difficulty in falling asleep, unlike CCVs, which are conditioned only by 
arterial and metabolic blood pressure conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in life expectancy in 2010-18 and during the 
covid-19 pandemic in 2020 across population groups in the United States and to 
compare outcomes with peer nations.
DESIGN: Simulations of provisional mortality data.
SETTING: US and 16 other high income countries in 2010-18 and 2020, by sex, 
including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity.
POPULATION: Data for the US and for 16 other high income countries from the 
National Center for Health Statistics and the Human Mortality Database, 
respectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, and at ages 25 and 65, by sex, 
and, in the US only, by race and ethnicity. Analysis excluded 2019 because life 
table data were not available for many peer countries. Life expectancy in 2020 
was estimated by simulating life tables from estimated age specific mortality 
rates in 2020 and allowing for 10% random error. Estimates for 2020 are reported 
as medians with fifth and 95th centiles.
RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2018, the gap in life expectancy between the US and 
the peer country average increased from 1.88 years (78.66 v 80.54 years, 
respectively) to 3.05 years (78.74 v 81.78 years). Between 2018 and 2020, life 
expectancy in the US decreased by 1.87 years (to 76.87 years), 8.5 times the 
average decrease in peer countries (0.22 years), widening the gap to 4.69 years. 
Life expectancy in the US decreased disproportionately among racial and ethnic 
minority groups between 2018 and 2020, declining by 3.88, 3.25, and 1.36 years 
in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White populations, 
respectively. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, reductions in life 
expectancy were 18 and 15 times the average in peer countries, respectively. 
Progress since 2010 in reducing the gap in life expectancy in the US between 
Black and White people was erased in 2018-20; life expectancy in Black men 
reached its lowest level since 1998 (67.73 years), and the longstanding Hispanic 
life expectancy advantage almost disappeared.
CONCLUSIONS: The US had a much larger decrease in life expectancy between 2018 
and 2020 than other high income nations, with pronounced losses among the 
Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations. A longstanding and widening US 
health disadvantage, high death rates in 2020, and continued inequitable effects 
on racial and ethnic minority groups are likely the products of longstanding 
policy choices and systemic racism.

INTRODUCTION: The process of adapting to a life with a chronic illness, is a 
well-researched phenomenon for a number of common chronic illnesses. The 
construct, adaptation, embeds the notions of integration of the chronic illness 
into identity and self-management. Integration precedes self-management and is 
key to living positively with a chronic illness. Adaptation is an important 
concept in understanding trajectory and outcomes of living with a chronic 
illness. Applicability of these concepts to HIV as a chronic illness; when 
suppressive adherence has been achieved, however, is unknown. Specifically, the 
adaptation process to living with HIV as a chronic illness, the integration of 
HIV into identity and the resulting self-management behaviours by adults living 
with HIV are relatively unexplored. We describe a protocol for a scoping review 
of adaptation to living with HIV, we structure the enquiry around integration of 
HIV into identity and self-management and interrogate theories, models and 
frameworks that have been proposed and studied and we evaluate them for 
relevance and usefulness in the care and management of HIV.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Methods proposed by the Johanna Briggs Institute will be 
followed. The protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews and was 
registered with the Open Science Framework. MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, 
CINHAL and SocINDEX databases will be searched. A search in Social Science 
Research Network eLibrary and Open Access Theses and Dissertations will gather 
grey literature and reference lists of included sources will be screened. Study 
selection process will involve a title and abstract review and full text review, 
guided by clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because this is a 
proposed review and collection of data on publicly available materials. The 
results will be published in a topic relevant journal and presented at related 
scientific events.

BACKGROUND: To explore the potential value of consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) 
in stage II colon cancer treatment selection, we carried out an early 
cost-effectiveness assessment of a CMS-based strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to evaluate three selection strategies: 
(i) the Dutch guideline strategy (MSS+pT4), (ii) the mutation-based strategy 
(MSS plus a BRAF and/or KRAS mutation or MSS plus pT4), and (iii) the CMS-based 
strategy (CMS4 or pT4). Outcomes were number of colon cancer deaths per 1,000 
patients, total discounted costs per patient (pp), and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) pp. The analyses were conducted from a Dutch societal 
perspective. The robustness of model predictions was assessed in sensitivity 
analyses. To evaluate the value of future research, we performed a value of 
information (VOI) analysis.
RESULTS: The Dutch guideline strategy resulted in 8.10 QALYs pp and total costs 
of €23,660 pp. The CMS-based and mutation-based strategies were more effective 
and more costly, with 8.12 and 8.13 QALYs pp and €24,643 and €24,542 pp, 
respectively. Assuming a threshold of €50,000/QALY, the mutation-based strategy 
was considered as the optimal strategy in an incremental analysis. However, the 
VOI analysis showed substantial decision uncertainty driven by the molecular 
markers (expected value of partial perfect information: €18M).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of current evidence, our analyses suggest that the 
mutation-based selection strategy would be the best use of resources. However, 
the extensive decision uncertainty for the molecular markers does not allow 
selection of an optimal strategy at present.
IMPACT: Future research is needed to eliminate decision uncertainty driven by 
molecular markers.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can have severe consequences 
both in women and men. Preadolescent girls are vaccinated against HPV worldwide 
but a gender-neutral vaccination is being adopted only little by little. This 
systematic review offers an overview of cost-effectiveness of the gender-neutral 
HPV vaccination.
METHODS: Economic evaluations of gender-neutral HPV vaccination with a two-dose 
schedule compared with girls-only strategy were systematically searched in 
Medline, Embase and WOS up to June 2020. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
and key parameters were analysed.
RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies concluded in 
favour of the gender-neutral programme, another four found it cost-effective 
only in alternative scenarios. The most influential parameters are the discount 
rate of benefits (same as for costs vs reduced), vaccine price (listed vs 
publicly negotiated) and included health problems (inclusion of oropharyngeal 
and penile cancers). Sponsorship was not decisive for the final result, but 
there were differences between industry-funded and independent studies in some 
cost categories.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of the cost-effectiveness of extending HPV vaccination 
to boys is scarce and ambiguous. Before the adoption of such a strategy, 
countries should carry out context-specific cost-effectiveness analyses, but the 
decision should also take into account other criteria, such as gender-related 
equality.

Gamma H2A histone family member X (γH2AX) is a molecular marker of aging and 
disease. However, radiosensitivity of the different brain cells, including 
neurons, glial cells, cells in cerebrovascular system, epithelial cells in pia 
mater, ependymal cells lining the ventricles of the brain in immature animals at 
different postnatal days remains unknown. Whether radiation-induced γH2AX foci 
in immature brain persist in adult animals still needs to be investigated. 
Hence, using a mouse model, we showed an extensive postnatal age-dependent 
induction of γH2AX foci in different brain regions at 1 day after whole body 
gamma irradiation with 5Gy at postnatal day 3 (P3), P10 and P21. P3 mouse brain 
epithelial cells in pia mater, glial cells in white matter and cells in 
cerebrovascular system were more radiosensitive at one day after radiation 
exposure than those from P10 and P21 mice. Persistent DNA damage foci (PDDF) 
were consistently demonstrated in the brain at 120 days and 15 months after 
irradiation at P3, P10 and P21, and these mice had shortened lifespan compared 
to the age-matched control. Our results suggest that early life 
irradiation-induced PDDF at later stages of animal life may be related to the 
brain aging and shortened life expectancy of irradiated animals.

As our life expectancy increases, specific medical conditions appear, and new 
challenges are met in terms of global health. Frailty has become a medical and 
scientific concept to define pathologies where inflammation, depressed immune 
system, cellular senescence, and molecular aging converge. But more importantly, 
frailty is the ultimate cause of death that limits our life span and 
deteriorates health in an increasing proportion of the world population. The 
difficulty of tackling this problem is the combination of factors that influence 
frailty appearance, such as stem cells exhaustion, inflammation, loss of 
regeneration capability, and impaired immunomodulation. To date, multiple 
research fields have found mechanisms participating in this health condition, 
but to make progress, science will need to investigate frailty with an 
interdisciplinary approach. This article summarizes the current efforts to 
understand frailty from their processes mediated by inflammation, aging, and 
stem cells to provide a new perspective that unifies the efforts in producing 
advanced therapies against medical conditions in the context of frailty. We 
believe this approach against frailty is particularly relevant to COVID-19, 
since people in a state of frailty die more frequently due to the 
hyperinflammatory process associated with this infection.
