OBJECTIVES: As obesity-associated events impact long-term survival, health 
economic (HE) modelling is commonly applied, but modelling approaches are 
diverse. This research aimed to compare the events simulation and the HE 
outcomes produced by different obesity modelling approaches.
METHODS: An external validation, using the Swedish obesity subjects (SOS) study, 
of three main structural event modelling approaches was performed: (1) 
continuous body mass index (BMI) approach; (2) risk equation approach; and (3) 
categorical BMI-related approach. Outcomes evaluated were mortality, 
cardiovascular events, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) for both the surgery and the 
control arms. Concordance between modelling results and the SOS study were 
investigated by different state-of-the-art measurements, and categorized by the 
grade of deviation observed (grades 1-4 expressing mild, moderate, severe, and 
very severe deviations). Furthermore, the costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained of surgery versus controls were compared.
RESULTS: Overall and by study arm, the risk equation approach presented the 
lowest average grade of deviation (overall grade 2.50; control arm 2.25; surgery 
arm 2.75), followed by the continuous BMI approach (overall 3.25; control 3.50; 
surgery 3.00) and by the categorial BMI approach (overall 3.63; control 3.50; 
surgery 3.75). Considering different confidence interval limits, the costs per 
QALY gained were fairly comparable between all structural approaches (ranging 
from £2,055 to £6,206 simulating a lifetime horizon).
CONCLUSION: None of the structural approaches provided perfect external event 
validation, although the risk equation approach showed the lowest overall 
deviations. The economic outcomes resulting from the three approaches were 
fairly comparable.

Beijing and Tianjin are two of the largest cities in northern China with high 
population densities and highly developed manufacturing industries. In the past 
decade, some authors have reported their PAH concentrations in surface soils, 
identified their sources and quantitatively reported their health risks. 
However, the contributions of different PAH sources to their toxicity have not 
been reported thus far. In this study, we reviewed the PAH concentrations, 
contributions of different sources to the toxicity, and cancer risks in soils 
from different land use types found within Beijing and Tianjin from data 
gathered by 41 studies. The total PAH concentration varied in the range of 
175.7-1989.0 ng g-1 with a higher median PAH concentration detected in urban 
soils (789.7 ng g-1), followed by suburban soils (647.3 ng g-1) and rural soils 
(390.8 ng g-1). Source identification using diagnostic ratios and principal 
component analysis (PCA) suggested that the PAHs in all three land use types 
mainly originated from biomass and coal combustion, vehicular emissions, and 
petrogenic processes with contributions varying from 13% to 62%. Furthermore, 
results from a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model suggested that 
vehicular emissions and coal combustion in urban soils, and the vehicular 
emissions, coal combustion and biomass combustion in suburban and rural soils 
dominated the total PAH concentrations (>85%). These results were consistent 
with those of the PCA model. Results of the additional toxicity apportionment 
performed using the PMF model suggested that vehicular emissions and coal 
combustion contributed the most to the toxic equivalent quantity for 
Benzo(a)Pyrene (BaPTEQ) and, by extension, to the carcinogenic potencies. The 
incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values suggested a low risk level for 
adults exposed to PAHs in the different land use types found within Beijing and 
Tianjin.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of drug-coated 
balloon (DCB) angioplasty compared with conventional balloon angioplasty (cPTA) 
in patients with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) 
dysfunction from a Singapore healthcare perspective.
METHODS: Existing cost-effectiveness studies comparing DCB and cPTA have not 
incorporated AVF/AVG abandonment costs. This Markov model-based economic 
evaluation incorporated AVF/AVG creation and maturation costs on top of routine 
intervention costs to model a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old AVF/AVG flow 
dysfunction patients. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years. 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental net monetary benefit (NMB) at 
a Singapore willingness-to-pay threshold of Singapore dollar (S$)87 000. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine 
parameter uncertainty. To test hypotheses regarding cost-effectiveness, 
intervention counts per patient, cumulative incidence functions of AVF/AVG 
abandonment, and survival curves of death were compared between DCB and cPTA.
RESULTS: DCB was not cost-effective at 3-year horizon (NMB = -S$1424), but was 
cost-effective at 1- and 6-year horizons (NMB = S$356 and S$3738, respectively). 
At 3 years, there was a 34.5% probability of DCB being cost-effective, but at 1- 
and 6-year horizons there was, respectively, 58.6% and 59.9% probability of DCB 
being cost-effective. DCB had graphically less AVF/AVG-abandonments, but this 
was not statistically significant (P = .21). Differences in other parameters 
were neither graphically nor statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: With AVF/AVG abandonment considered, DCB may be weakly 
cost-effective compared with cPTA in treating AVF/AVG flow dysfunction. AV 
access creation and maturation costs could have important explanatory value in 
assessing DCB cost-effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Primary cardiac angiosarcoma is extremely rare, and 
its prognosis remains poor, with a mean life expectancy of only a few months. 
Here, we report a case of primary cardiac angiosarcoma.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Japanese woman with a month-long history of 
dyspnea was admitted to our hospital for pericardial effusion. Chest computed 
tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass in the right 
atrium. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor, and the 
pathological diagnosis was angiosarcoma. The patient received radiotherapy after 
surgery. Six months following surgery, she underwent chemotherapy following the 
diagnosis of lung metastasis. The patient died 18 months after the initial 
diagnosis.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Cardiac angiosarcoma is rare and difficult to diagnose 
early because it is associated with few symptoms. Moreover, there are currently 
no established guidelines for the treatment of this disease because of its 
rarity and sparse descriptive literature Therefore, multidisciplinary therapies 
should be considered, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: There is no standard treatment for cardiac angiosarcoma, but 
surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these 
therapies may be useful.

This paper summarises institutional and policy bottlenecks to IPM in Africa. 
Agricultural policy in Africa generally prioritises production and productivity 
above environmental sustainability, so the use of synthetic pesticides for 
controlling pests is encouraged. Funding for research in IPM is limited, and 
extension systems struggle to provide the level of farmer support that adoption 
of IPM often needs. Improved research and extension policies could facilitate 
uptake of IPM. Public and private food-safety standards can incentivise 
adoption, but currently this is mainly in production for export. Pesticide and 
other input regulatory systems unintentionally constrain adoption of IPM, 
through expensive registration procedures, weak compliance monitoring and 
limited regional harmonisation. IPM must be seen as a key element of 
food-system transformation.

INTRODUCTION: Knee replacement (KR) is a clinically proven procedure typically 
offered to patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) to relieve pain and 
improve quality of life. However, artificial joints fail over time, requiring 
revision associated with higher mortality and inferior outcomes. With more young 
people presenting with knee OA and increasing life expectancy, there is an unmet 
need to postpone time to first KR. Knee joint distraction (KJD), the practice of 
using external fixators to open up knee joint space, is proposed as potentially 
effective to preserve the joint following initial studies in the Netherlands, 
however, has not been researched within an NHS setting. The KARDS trial will 
investigate whether KJD is non-inferior to KR in terms of patient-reported 
postoperative pain 12 months post-surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: KARDS is a phase III, multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, 
individually randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing KJD with KR 
in patients with severe knee OA, employing a hybrid-expertise design, with 
internal pilot phase and process evaluation. 344 participants will be randomised 
(1:1) to KJD or KR. The primary outcome measure is the Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) pain domain score at 12 months 
post-operation. Secondary outcome measures include patient-reported overall 
KOOS, Pain Visual Analogue Scale and Oxford Knee Scores, knee function 
assessments, joint space width, complications and further interventions over 24 
months post-operation. Per patient cost difference between KR and KJD and cost 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained over 24 months will be estimated 
within trial, and incremental cost per QALY gained over 20 years by KJD relative 
to KR predicted using decision analytic modelling.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics 
Committee (REC) and Health Research Authority (HRA). Trial results will be 
disseminated at clinical conferences, through relevant patient groups and 
published in peer-reviewed journals.

RNA catalytic and binding interactions with proteins and small molecules are 
fundamental elements of cellular life processes as well as the basis for RNA 
therapeutics and molecular engineering. In the absence of quantitative 
predictive capacity for such bioaffinity interactions, high throughput 
experimental approaches are needed to sufficiently sample RNA sequence space. 
Here we report on a simple and highly accessible approach to convert 
commercially available customized DNA microarrays of any complexity and density 
to RNA microarrays via a T7 RNA polymerase-mediated extension of 
photocrosslinked methyl RNA primers and subsequent degradation of the DNA 
templates.

(1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, NYU Grossman School of 
Medicine, New York, NY, USA.

OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to identify and map the available evidence 
surrounding cochlear implantation (CI) in older adults. Five outcomes were 
evaluated: speech perception scores, perioperative complications, neurocognitive 
outcomes, quality of life outcomes and vestibular dysfunction and fall rates 
after surgery.
METHODS: A scoping review was performed in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping 
Reviews and included patients over the age of 60.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing 7,182 
patients. Mean (SD) speech perception scores in quiet and in noise pre-and 
postoperatively were 7.9% (6.7) and 52.8% (14.3) and 8.0% (68.1) and 68.1% 
(15.9) respectively. Postoperative cardiac arrhythmias, urinary retention, and 
delirium occurred slightly more frequently in older adults. In terms of 
cognition, most studies noted stability or improvement one year after 
implantation. A majority of studies indicated better quality of life post-CI. 
Rates of fall after surgery were rarely reported, and there was a general 
paucity of data surrounding vestibular function changes after CI.
DISCUSSION: This scoping review identifies many positive outcomes linked to CI 
in older adults. No findings suggest a single patient characteristic that would 
warrant refusal to consider evaluation for cochlear implantation.

Observational Study Assessing Nutritional Status, Eating Behavior and Barriers 
to Healthy Eating in Psychiatric Inpatients and Outpatients Compared to Healthy 
Adults.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are often associated with unhealthy eating 
behaviors and metabolic comorbidities. This can result in reduced life 
expectancy and poorer quality of life in people with mental disorders. This 
study protocol describes an observational study that examines the nutritional 
status and eating behaviors of people with severe mental illness (SMI) and the 
need for psychiatric treatment who were between 18 and 65 years old. In 
addition, the study focuses on possible barriers for healthy eating that have 
not yet been examined in this population.
METHODS: A total of 192 study participants will be recruited: 64 inpatients and 
64 outpatients from the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Zurich with 
SMI as well as 64 healthy individuals from the general population as a control 
group. The participants will be interviewed regarding their nutritional status, 
eating behavior, nutrition knowledge, food and cooking skills, personality, 
attitudes and feelings toward nutrition. In addition, the severity of symptoms 
and several control variables (e.g., sociodemographic variables and physical 
activity) will be assessed. For the patient samples, data will comprise routine 
medical data, and, if available, routine laboratory data. Inpatients will be 
interviewed once at the beginning of their treatment. Outpatients will be 
interviewed at the beginning and after 3 months of treatment (same interview 
questions). Healthy adults of the control group will be interviewed once at any 
time during the recruitment period.
DISCUSSION: The described study will identify nutritional needs and possible 
barriers to healthy eating in patients with mental disorders. The results will 
help to define recommendations for nutritional risk screening in psychiatric 
patients and for planning effective nutritional interventions.

Knee osteonecrosis is a debilitating progressive degenerative disease 
characterized by subchondral bone ischemia. It can lead to localized necrosis, 
tissue death, and progressive joint destruction. For this reason, it is 
essential to diagnose and treat this disease early to avoid subchondral 
collapse, chondral damage, and end-stage osteoarthritis, where the only solution 
is total knee arthroplasty. Three types of knee osteonecrosis have been 
documented in the literature: spontaneous or primitive, secondary, and post 
arthroscopy. Spontaneous osteonecrosis is the most common type studied in the 
literature. Secondary osteonecrosis of the knee is a rare disease and, unlike 
the spontaneous one, involves patients younger than 50 years. It presents a 
particular set of pathological, clinical, imaging, and progression features. The 
management of secondary osteonecrosis is determined by the stage of the 
disorder, the clinical manifestation, the size and location of the lesions, 
whether the involvement is unilateral or bilateral, the patient's age, level of 
activity, general health, and life expectancy. This review aims to present the 
recent evidence on treatment options for secondary osteonecrosis of the knee, 
including conservative treatment, joint preserving surgery, and knee 
replacement.

BACKGROUND: In elderly patients with human epidermal growth factor 2-positive 
breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with decreased quality of 
life, with relatively small benefits for prognosis. We examined the 
cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab monotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy plus 
trastuzumab in elderly patients with human epidermal growth factor 2-positive 
breast cancer.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs and benefits of 
trastuzumab monotherapy over adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab for elderly 
patients with human epidermal growth factor 2-positive breast cancer. We built 
the model with a yearly cycle over a 20-year time horizon and five health 
states: disease-free, relapse, post-relapse, metastasis and death. The 
parameters in the model were based on a previous randomized controlled trial and 
a nationwide administrative database in Japan. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as Japanese yen per the quality-adjusted 
life-years, was estimated from the perspective of health care payers. One-way 
deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 
Monte-Carlo simulations of 10 000 samples were conducted.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of trastuzumab monotherapy 
over adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab was $\sim$1.8 million Japanese yen 
/quality-adjusted life-year. The one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis 
showed that transition probability from disease-free to metastasis status and 
cost of metastasis status had the greatest influence on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. More than half the estimates in the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were located below a threshold of willingness-to-pay of 5 
million Japanese yen /quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSION: In this first comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of adjuvant 
chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus trastuzumab monotherapy in the elderly, the 
latter was found favorable for elderly patients with human epidermal growth 
factor 2-positive breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) therapy is an efficacious management 
strategy for young people with type 1 diabetes. However, high costs prevent 
equitable access. We thus sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCL 
therapy compared with current care among young people with type 1 diabetes in 
Australia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A patient-level Markov model was constructed to 
simulate disease progression for young people with type 1 diabetes using HCL 
therapy versus current care, with follow-up from 12 until 25 years of age. 
Downstream health and economic consequences were compared via decision analysis. 
Treatment effects and proportions using different technologies to define 
"current care" were based primarily on data from an Australian pediatric 
randomized controlled trial. Transition probabilities and utilities for health 
states were sourced from published studies. Costs were considered from the 
Australian health care system's perspective. An annual discount rate of 5% was 
applied to future costs and outcomes. Uncertainty was evaluated with 
probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Use of HCL therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of Australian dollars (AUD) $32,789 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained. The majority of simulations (93.3%) were below the commonly accepted 
willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD $50,000 per QALY gained in Australia. 
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the base-case results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: In this first cost-effectiveness analysis of HCL technologies for 
the management of young people with type 1 diabetes, HCL therapy was found to be 
cost-effective compared with current care in Australia.

OBJECTIVES: The population of older adults is growing fast, especially in Europe 
and Northern America. Old age is often associated with mental health 
comorbidities. Moreover, life expectancy of people suffering from psychiatric 
disorders has increased, but with age-related difficulties, such as loss of 
independence. This represents a challenge for public health policies, as this 
population requires specific care and living conditions. As a response, a 
convention was signed between living facilities for dependent elderly (EHPAD) 
and the GHU Paris Psychiatry and Neurosciences. The agreement included dedicated 
places in EHPAD for older patients with psychiatric disorders. The aim of the 
study was to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of those 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients who applied for an 
EHPAD admission.
RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, 163 patients applied for placement in an EHPAD, 
and 117 were admitted (72%). Applicants were 71 years old on average. Admitted 
patients were older than non-admitted and lived in different Parisian sectors. 
Among admitted patients, nine in 10 were single, divorced or widowed, and 64.3% 
were childless. Almost half of them were schizophrenic or had delusional 
disorders (46.9%), and 65.3% were considered as moderately dependent. At the 
time of the study, 89 patients still lived in EHPAD. Almost half of them had 
anxiety and depressive disorders (48.3%), 19.1% had cognitive disorders, and 
42.7% manifested agitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted older psychiatric patients' specificities 
regarding their admission status into long-term living facilities.

COVID-19 pandemic revolutionized the way in which cancer patients are treated 
worldwide. Regarding neuro-oncological patients, usually considered frail and 
with lower life-expectancy in respect to other oncological patients, the 
international scientific community had to urgently reorganize the treatment 
approach in order to minimize the risk of in-hospital contagious. For GBM 
patients, adjuvant treatments have been evaluated with even much more attention 
with regard to the expected efficacy. As a consequence, an hypofractioned 
radiotherapy regimen has been preferred in order to reduce the daily hospital 
accesses and, especially in pMGMT unmethylated patients, chemotherapy with 
Temozolomide was avoided. Here, we made a comprehensive evaluation of the 
neurooncological community suggestions regarding GBM treatment in the 
pre-vaccine era of COVID-19 pandemic.

Neck paragangliomas are orphan diseases with incidence 1:30 000-1:100 000. Life 
expectancy is poor in patients with distant metastasis (5-year overall survival 
11.8%), whereas 5-year overall survival in patients with regional metastasis is 
76.8-82.4%. Meanwhile, there is still no any reliable tool for prediction of 
malignant potential of paraganglioma. Above-mentioned data indicate an 
importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment of neck paragangliomas. Total 
resection of tumor in ablastic conditions is a gold standard of treatment. 
However, surgery is associated with a high risk of neurovascular complications 
and requires multidisciplinary approach. Nevertheless, new knowledge dedicated 
to different aspects of pathogenesis of neck paraganglioma, diagnosis and 
treatment arise every year. This review is devoted to modern data on neck 
paragangliomas.

Publisher: Параганглиомы шеи — это орфанные заболевания с частотой встречаемости

неблагоприятный: 5-летняя выживаемость составляет 11,8%, а при развитии 
регионарных метастазов — 76,8—82,4%. При этом до сих пор не существует надежного 
инструмента для прогнозирования потенциала метастазирования параганглиом. Это 
указывает на важность ранней диагностики и своевременного лечения параганглиом 
шеи. Золотым стандартом лечения является радикальное хирургическое удаление 
опухоли в абластичных условиях. Вместе с тем хирургия параганглиом шеи 
ассоциирована с высоким риском нейроваскулярных осложнений и требует 
мультидисциплинарного подхода. Каждый год появляются новые знания, отражающие 
различные аспекты онкогенеза, диагностики и лечения параганглиом шеи. Данная 
статья представляет собой всесторонний обзор современных знаний о параганглиомах

Lipid droplets (LDs) stored during seed development are mobilized and provide 
essential energy and lipids to support seedling growth upon germination. 
Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the main neutral lipids stored in LDs. The lipase 
SUGAR DEPENDENT 1 (SDP1), which hydrolyzes TAGs in Arabidopsis thaliana, is 
localized on peroxisomes and traffics to the LD surface through peroxisomal 
extension, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a 
previously unknown function of a plant-unique endosomal sorting complex required 
for transport (ESCRT) component FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR ENDOSOMAL 
SORTING 1 (FREE1) in regulating peroxisome/SDP1-mediated LD turnover in 
Arabidopsis. We showed that LD degradation was impaired in germinating free1 
mutant; moreover, the tubulation of SDP1- or PEROXIN 11e (PEX11e)-marked 
peroxisomes and the migration of SDP1-positive peroxisomes to the LD surface 
were altered in the free1 mutant. Electron tomography analysis showed that 
peroxisomes failed to form tubules to engulf LDs in free1, unlike in the 
wild-type. FREE1 interacted directly with both PEX11e and SDP1, suggesting that 
these interactions may regulate peroxisomal extension and trafficking of the 
lipase SDP1 to LDs. Taken together, our results demonstrate a pivotal role for 
FREE1 in LD degradation in germinating seedlings via regulating peroxisomal 
tubulation and SDP1 targeting.

INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis affects children with a considerable burden in early 
life. Treating pediatric psoriasis is challenging also because of the lack of 
updated specific guidelines. With the recent approval of several biologics for 
pediatric psoriasis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the management of young 
psoriatic patients is facing major changes. A revision of treatment 
recommendations is therefore needed.
METHODS: In September 2021, a board of six Italian dermatologists convened to 
update treatment recommendations. The board issued evidence- and consensus-based 
statements covering relevant areas of pediatric psoriasis, namely: assessment of 
psoriasis severity, management of children with psoriasis, and treatment of 
pediatric psoriasis. To reach consensus, the statements were submitted to a 
panel of 24 experts in a Delphi process performed entirely via videoconference. 
A treatment algorithm was produced.
RESULTS: There was full consensus that psoriasis severity is determined by the 
extension/severity of skin lesions, site of lesions, and impact on patient 
quality of life. Agreement was reached on the need for a multidisciplinary 
approach to pediatric psoriasis and the importance of patient/parents education. 
The relevance of vaccinations, including COVID-19 vaccination, for psoriatic 
children was acknowledged by all participants. Management issues that initially 
failed to reach consensus included the screening for psoriasis comorbidities and 
early treatment with biologics to prevent them and the use of telemedicine to 
facilitate patient follow-up. There was full consensus that topical 
corticosteroids are the first choice for the treatment of mild pediatric 
psoriasis, while phototherapy and systemic therapy are used in children with 
moderate-severe psoriasis. According to the proposed treatment algorithm, 
biologics are the first line of systemic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted systemic therapies are changing the treatment of 
moderate-severe pediatric psoriasis, while topical corticosteroids continue to 
be the first choice for mild disease. Children-centered research is needed to 
further improve the treatment of pediatric psoriasis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), severe 
liver vascular malformations are associated with mutations in the Activin A 
Receptor-Like Type 1 ( ACVRL1 ) gene encoding ALK1, the receptor for bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9/BMP10, which regulates blood vessel development. 
Here, we established an HHT mouse model with exclusive liver involvement and 
adequate life expectancy to investigate ALK1 signaling in liver vessel formation 
and metabolic function.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC)-selective Cre 
deleter line, Stab2-iCreF3 , was crossed with Acvrl1 -floxed mice to generate 
LSEC-specific Acvrl1 -deficient mice ( Alk1HEC-KO ). Alk1HEC-KO mice revealed 
hepatic vascular malformations and increased posthepatic flow, causing right 
ventricular volume overload. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated induction of 
proangiogenic/tip cell gene sets and arterialization of hepatic vessels at the 
expense of LSEC and central venous identities. Loss of LSEC angiokines Wnt2 , 
Wnt9b , and R-spondin-3 ( Rspo3 ) led to disruption of metabolic liver zonation 
in Alk1HEC-KO mice and in liver specimens of patients with HHT. Furthermore, 
prion-like protein doppel ( Prnd ) and placental growth factor ( Pgf ) were 
upregulated in Alk1HEC-KO hepatic endothelial cells, representing candidates 
driving the organ-specific pathogenesis of HHT. In LSEC in vitro , stimulation 
or inhibition of ALK1 signaling counter-regulated Inhibitors of DNA binding 
(ID)1-3, known Alk1 transcriptional targets. Stimulation of ALK1 signaling and 
inhibition of ID1-3 function confirmed regulation of Wnt2 and Rspo3 by the 
BMP9/ALK1/ID axis.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic endothelial ALK1 signaling protects from development of 
vascular malformations preserving organ-specific endothelial differentiation and 
angiocrine signaling. The long-term surviving Alk1HEC-KO HHT model offers 
opportunities to develop targeted therapies for this severe disease.
