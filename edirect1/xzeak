from faster improvements in mortality compared to other high-income countries, 
especially from the 1960s, leading to an exceptional increase in life 
expectancy. However, Italy has not become the leader in longevity. Here, we 
investigate life expectancy trends in Italy during the period 1960-2015 for both 
sexes. Additionally, we contribute to the existing literature by complementing 
life expectancy with an indicator of dispersion in ages at death, also known as 
lifespan inequality. Lifespan inequality underlies heterogeneity over age in 
populating health improvements and is a marker of uncertainty in the timing of 
death. We further quantify the contributions of different age groups and causes 
of death to recent trends in life expectancy and lifespan inequality. Our 
findings highlight the contributions of cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms to 
the recent increase in life expectancy but not necessarily to the decrease in 
lifespan inequality. Our results also uncover a more recent challenge across 
Italy: worsening mortality from infectious diseases and mortality at older age.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: The optimum starting dose of intravenous continuous 
erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.) has been previously determined; 
this study ascertains the optimum starting dose of subcutaneous C.E.R.A. 
administration in pediatric patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 3 months to 17 years with renal anemia and 
chronic kidney disease (CKD; including those treated with maintenance dialysis 
and those not treated with dialysis) who were receiving maintenance treatment 
with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).
INTERVENTION: Subcutaneous C.E.R.A. administration every 4 weeks (starting dose 
was based on defined conversion factors).
OUTCOME: The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin concentration between 
the baseline and evaluation period for each patient. Secondary efficacy measures 
and safety were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty patients aged 0.4-17.7 years were enrolled. The study achieved 
its primary outcome: the mean change in hemoglobin concentration was an increase 
of 0.48g/dL; the 95% confidence interval (0.15-0.82) and standard deviation 
(±1.03) were within the prespecified boundaries (-1 to 1g/dL and<1.5g/dL, 
respectively). Mean hemoglobin concentrations were maintained within the target 
10-12g/dL range in 24 of 38 patients and within±1g/dL of the baseline in 19 of 
38 patients, and the median C.E.R.A. subcutaneous dose decreased over time. 
Efficacy in key subgroups (age group, dialysis type, prior ESA treatment) was 
consistent with the primary outcome. Thirty-eight patients completed the core 
period; 25 chose to enter the safety extension period. Safety was consistent 
with prior studies, with no new signals.
LIMITATIONS: Single-arm and open-label study; small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with anemia secondary to CKD who were on, or not 
on, dialysis could be safely and effectively switched from maintenance ESAs to 
subcutaneous C.E.R.A. administered every 4 weeks, using defined dose-conversion 
factors to determine the optimum starting dose.

TRIAL REGISTRATION: The SKIPPER trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with 
study number NCT03552393.
PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Anemia, a complication of chronic kidney disease, is 
associated with poor quality of life and an increased risk of hospitalization 
and mortality. The current treatments for anemia include iron therapy and 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); however, the relatively short 
half-lives of the ESAs epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa may require more 
frequent dosing and hospital visits compared with the ESA known as continuous 
erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.). A previous study demonstrated that 
children aged 5 years or more with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease 
who were on hemodialysis could be switched to intravenous C.E.R.A. from their 
existing epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa treatment. This study provides 
evidence that subcutaneous C.E.R.A. can safely and effectively treat anemia in 
children, including those aged<5 years and regardless of whether they were on 
dialysis or the type of dialysis they received (peritoneal dialysis or 
hemodialysis).

There is a high prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension in the elderly; 70% 
of adults >65 years have this disease. A key mechanism in the development of 
hypertension in the elderly is increased arterial stiffness. This accounts for 
the increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and fall in diastolic 
blood pressure (isolated systolic hypertension) that are commonly seen in the 
elderly, compared with younger persons. The diagnosis of hypertension is made on 
the basis of in-office blood pressure measurements together with ambulatory and 
home blood pressure recordings. Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of 
management of hypertension. Comprehensive guidelines regarding blood pressure 
threshold at which to start pharmacotherapy as well as target blood pressure 
levels have been issued by both European and American professional bodies. In 
recent years, there has been considerable interest in intensive lowering of 
blood pressure in older patients with hypertension. Several large, randomized 
controlled trials have suggested that a strategy of aiming for a target systolic 
blood pressure of <120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) rather than a target of 
<140 mm Hg (standard treatment) results in significant reduction in the 
incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and total mortality. A systolic blood 
pressure treatment of <130 mm Hg should be considered favorably in 
non-institutionalized, ambulatory, free living older patients. In contrast, in 
the older patient with a high burden of comorbidities and limited life 
expectancy, an individualized team-based approach, based on clinical judgment 
and patient preference should be adopted. An increasing body of evidence for 
older adults with hypertension suggests that intensive blood pressure lowering 
may prevent or at least partially prevent cognitive decline.

Large language models utilizing transformer neural networks and other deep 
learning architectures demonstrated unprecedented results in many tasks 
previously accessible only to human intelligence. In this article, we 
collaborate with ChatGPT, an AI model developed by OpenAI to speculate on the 
applications of Rapamycin, in the context of Pascal's Wager philosophical 
argument commonly utilized to justify the belief in god. In response to the 
query "Write an exhaustive research perspective on why taking Rapamycin may be 
more beneficial than not taking Rapamycin from the perspective of Pascal's 
wager" ChatGPT provided the pros and cons for the use of Rapamycin considering 
the preclinical evidence of potential life extension in animals. This article 
demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT to produce complex philosophical arguments 
and should not be used for any off-label use of Rapamycin.

BACKGROUND: The changing trends and risk-attributed burdens of kidney cancer in 
China are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the latest status and 
trends of kidney cancer burden in China and its associated risk factors.
METHODS: The absolute numbers and rates of the incidence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of kidney cancer in China were extracted 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 platform. Overall burden and burden 
attributed to smoking and high body mass index (BMI) were described. Average 
annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to describe trend analyses from 1990 
to 2019 using the Joinpoint regression program.
RESULTS: In 2019, 59,827 new cases, 23,954 deaths, and 642,799 DALYs of kidney 
cancer occurred in China, of which men accounted for 71.1, 70.5, and 72.0%, and 
the population aged ≥55 years accounted for 58.9, 77.9, and 60.1%, of new cases, 
deaths, and DALYs, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized 
incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased from 1.16 in 1990 to 3.21 in 
2019, with an AAPC of 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1-3.8%, p < 0.05); 
the mortality rate increased from 0.70 to 1.27, with an AAPC of 2.1% (1.5-2.3%, 
p < 0.05); and the DALY rate increased from 0.70 to 1.27, with an AAPC of 2.1% 
(1.5-2.3%, p < 0.05). In 2019, the proportions of DALYs attributed to smoking 
and high BMI were 18.0% and 11.1%, respectively, and the DALY rates attributed 
to both smoking and high BMI increased from 1990 to 2019, with AAPC of 2.9% 
(2.6-3.3%, p < 0.05) and 4.8% (4.2-5.4%, p < 0.05), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The kidney cancer burden in China has continued to grow over the 
recent three decades, with a severe burden among older adults and men. 
Therefore, timely preventive interventions for modifiable risk factors are 
required.

INTRODUCTION: Low physical activity (LPA) is associated with several major 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and premature mortality. In this study, we 
aimed to assess the global burden and trends in disease attributable to LPA 
(DALPA) from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Annual age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
death rates of DALPA [all-cause and five specific causes (ischaemic heart 
disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, colon and rectal cancer, and breast cancer)] 
by sex, age, geographical region and social deprivation index (SDI) score from 
1990 to 2019 were available from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. 
The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify the 
changing trend. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to explore the 
relationship between DALYs/death rates of DALPA and sociodemographic factors.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019, the age-standardized DALYs and death rates of DALPA 
were 198.42/100,000 (95% UI: 108.16/100,000-360.32/100,000) and 11.10/100,000 
(95% UI: 5.66/100,000-19.51/100,000), respectively. There were 15.74 million 
(8.51-28.61) DALYs and 0.83 million (0.43-1.47) deaths attributable to LPA. 
Overall, age-standardized DALYs and death rates presented significant downward 
trends with EAPCs [-0.68% (95% CI: -0.85- -0.50%) for DALYs and -1.00% (95% CI: 
-1.13- -0.86%) for deaths] from 1990 to 2019. However, age-standardized DALYs 
and death rates of diabetes mellitus attributable to LPA were substantially 
increased [EAPC: 0.76% (95% CI: 0.70-0.82%) for DALYs and 0.33% (95% CI: 
0.21-0.51%) for deaths]. In the 15-49 age group, DALPA presented significant 
upward trends [EAPC: 0.74% (95% CI: 0.58-0.91%) for DALYs and 0.31% (95% CI: 
0.1-0.51%) for deaths]. The GLM revealed that higher gross domestic product and 
current health expenditure (% of GDP) were negatively associated with DALYs and 
death rates of DALPA.
CONCLUSION: Although global age-standardized DALYs and death rates of DALPA 
presented downward trends, they still cause a heavy burden worldwide. These 
rates showed upward trends in the diabetic and 15-49 age groups, which need more 
attention and health interventions.

Bread staling and microbial growth is a complex physiochemical change that 
occurs during bread storage mainly reducing the quality and consumer acceptance. 
It is significant to understand the causes of physical, chemical, and microbial 
spoilage of bakery products in the food industry, to prevent quality decay and 
economic loss for manufacturers and consumers. Traditional packaging has 
limitations in protecting and preserving the final products' safety, hygiene, 
and quality. Effective novel strategies must be included in food packaging, 
especially to minimize the organoleptic losses of baked foods during their shelf 
life. Furthermore, owing to the spread of foodborne diseases, which directly 
affect the safety of the products, customer demand is increasing significantly 
to reduce the use of synthetic preservatives instead of natural ones. Innovative 
packaging is altering the way food items are packed in several ways to extend 
and monitor product shelf life. Traditional packaging includes packaging food in 
synthetic polymer film; however, modern technology allows them to interact with 
active/functional substances. This paper discusses innovative bread packaging 
strategies such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), active packaging (AP), 
intelligent packaging (IP), biosensor, and nano packaging. Furthermore, MAP and 
AP have received greater attention in this study due to their considerable 
effect in prolonging the shelf life of bread and naturally preventing fungal 
activity, and have gained a lot of interest among producers and consumers in 
recent years.

Aging is a natural process of extinction of the body and the main aspect that 
determines the life expectancy for individuals who have survived to the 
post-reproductive period. The process of aging is accompanied by certain 
physiological, immune, and metabolic changes in the body, as well as the 
development of age-related diseases. The contribution of genetic factors to 
human life expectancy is estimated at about 25-30%. Despite the success in 
identifying genes and metabolic pathways that may be involved in the life 
extension process in model organisms, the key question remains to what extent 
these data can be extrapolated to humans, for example, because of the complexity 
of its biological and sociocultural systems, as well as possible species 
differences in life expectancy and causes of mortality. New molecular genetic 
methods have significantly expanded the possibilities for searching for genetic 
factors of human life expectancy and identifying metabolic pathways of aging, 
the interaction of genes and transcription factors, the regulation of gene 
expression at the level of transcription, and epigenetic modifications. The 
review presents the latest research and current strategies for studying the 
genetic basis of human aging and longevity: the study of individual candidate 
genes in genetic population studies, variations identified by the GWAS method, 
immunogenetic differences in aging, and genomic studies to identify factors of 
"healthy aging." Understanding the mechanisms of the interaction between factors 
affecting the life expectancy and the possibility of their regulation can become 
the basis for developing comprehensive measures to achieve healthy longevity.

INTRODUCTION: Controversies surround the issue if chronic consumption of a 
high-sugar diet is detrimental to health or not. This study investigates whether 
lifelong consumption of a higher sucrose diet will induce overeating, and 
obesity, and cause metabolic dysfunctions such as hyperglycemia and 
dyslipidaemia in C57BL/6N mice, compared to a lower sucrose diet.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice at 3 weeks of age were randomized into consuming a 
diet with 25 or 10% kcal from sucrose for the rest of their lives. Body weight, 
food and water intake, fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipid levels were 
measured at regular intervals. At the end of the study, organs and tissues were 
collected and gene expression was measured.
RESULTS: There was no discernible difference in the impact on food intake, body 
composition, glucose and lipid homeostasis, liver triglyceride content, life 
expectancy, as well as gene expression related to intermediary metabolism 
between mice fed a diet with 10 vs. 25% kcal as sucrose over their lifespan. We 
also showed that switching from a 25% kcal diet to a 10% kcal diet at different 
life stages, or vice versa, did not appear to affect these outcomes of interest.
DISCUSSION: The results from our study suggest that lifelong consumption of a 
higher sugar diet generally did not induce overeating and obesity, disrupt 
carbohydrate metabolism and lipid homeostasis, and reduce life expectancy 
compared with a lower sugar diet. Our unorthodox findings disagreed with the 
popular belief that higher sugar consumption is detrimental to health, which 
should be confirmed in future studies.

The clinical need for bone regenerative solutions is expanding with increasing 
life expectancy and escalating incidence of accidents. Several strategies are 
being investigated to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. We 
previously reported two different approaches for this purpose, in monolayer and 
three-dimensional cell culture. The first approach was based on pretreating 
cells with 5-Aza-dC, a DNA methylation inhibitor, before the applying the 
differentiation media. The second approach was based on culturing cells on a 
glass surface during differentiation. In this study, we investigated the 
potential effect of combining both methods. Our results suggested that both 
approaches were associated with decreasing global DNA methylation levels. Cells 
cultured as a monolayer on glass surface showed enhancement in alkaline 
phosphatase activity at day 10, while 5-Aza-dC pretreatment enhanced the 
activity at day 5, irrespective of the culture surface. In three-dimensional 
pellet culture, 5-Aza-dC pretreatment enhanced osteogenesis through Runx-2 and 
TGF-β1 upregulation while the glass surface induced Osterix. Furthermore, 
pellets cultured on glass showed upregulation of a group of miRNAs, including 
pro-osteogenesis miR- 20a and miR -148b and anti-osteogenesis miR -125b, miR 
-31, miR -138, and miR -133a. Interestingly, 5-Aza-dC was not associated with a 
change of miRNAs in cells cultured on tissue culture plastic but reverted the 
upregulated miRNAs on the glass to the basal level. This study confirms the two 
approaches for enhancing osteogenic differentiation and contradicts their 
combination.

Menopausal transition entails a progressive decrease in hormone production by 
the ovaries that lead to important physical and psychological changes that could 
significantly affect quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 
administered from the onset of menopausal symptoms usually improves quality of 
life and life expectancy. Nevertheless, it is not risk-free. Ovarian tissue 
cryopreservation (OTC) has been investigated as a potential new strategy for 
delaying menopause and/or to avoid HRT. This review analyzes the critical points 
of HRT to assess whether OTC and subsequent reimplantation can affect 
postmenopausal management. We assessed available randomized clinical trials in 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, ISI web of science, and Scopus from August 2021 to 
November 2022, including studies and trials evaluating the efficacy of OTC in 
both cancer and menopausal patients, the efficacy of freezing techniques and the 
possible clinical scenarios that OTC can open, even from the standpoint of legal 
and ethical issues arising as such innovative techniques become mainstream. 
Lower duration of the graft and efficacy on estrogen secretions at a 
physiological and safer concentration of estrogen than conventional HRT based on 
hormonal supplements. OTC can reportedly trigger estrogen secretions at a lower 
and safer physiological concentration than conventional HRT. OTC and subsequent 
reimplantation remain a valid fertility-sparing approach in patients undergoing 
gonadotoxic treatments. Further studies are needed to better evaluate its safety 
and efficacy within postmenopausal therapy management and in order to lay out 
widely shared and evidence-based guidelines and best practices and perform such 
novel and innovative techniques in a legally and ethically safe fashion, in the 
best interest of patients and healthcare professionals.

INTRODUCTION: In view of the vaso-occlusive pathophysiology affecting osseous 
micro-circulation, sickle cell disease (SCD) is well known to present with 
diverse skeletal and arthritic manifestations. With prolonged life-expectancy 
over the past decades, there has been a progressive increase in the proportion 
of SCD patients requiring joint reconstructions. Owing to the paucity of 
evidence in the literature, the post-operative complication rates and outcome in 
these patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are still largely 
unknown.
METHODS: Based on the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (using ICD-10 CMP 
code), patients who underwent TKA between 2016 and 2019 were identified. The 
cohort were classified into two groups: A-those with SCD; and B-those without. 
The data on patients' demographics, co-morbidities, details regarding hospital 
stay including expenditure incurred, and complications were analyzed and 
compared.
RESULTS: Overall, 558,361 patients underwent unilateral, primary TKA; among 
whom, 493 (0.1%) were known cases of SCD (group A). Group A included a 
significantly greater proportion of younger (60.14 ± 10.87 vs 
66.72 ± 9.50 years; p < 0.001), male (77.3 vs 61.5%; p < 0.001); and 
African-American (88.2 vs 8.3%B; p < 0.001) patients, in comparison with group 
B. Group A patients were also at a significantly higher risk for longer duration 
of peri-operative hospital stay (p < 0.001), greater health-care costs incurred 
(p < 0.001), and greater need for alternative step-down health-care facilities 
(p < 0.001) following discharge. Among the SCD patients, 24.7%, 20.9% and 24.9% 
developed acute chest syndrome, pain crisis and splenic sequestration crisis, 
respectively during the peri-operative period. Group A patients had a 
statistically greater incidence of acute renal failure (ARF; p = 0.014), need 
for blood transfusion (p < 0.001) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT; p = 0.03) 
during the early admission period.
CONCLUSION: The presence of SCD substantially lengthens the duration of hospital 
stay and enhances health care-associated expenditure in patients undergoing TKA. 
SCD patients are at significantly higher risk for systemic complications 
including acute chest syndrome, pain crisis, splenic sequestration crisis, acute 
renal failure, higher need for blood transfusions and deep venous thrombosis 
during the initial peri-operative period following TKA.

This paper describes a continuation of earlier work using the finite element 
method to conduct an engineering failure analysis of an existing polycentric 
prosthetic knee. The primary purpose of this work is to enhance the quality of 
the existing knee which has been reported with multiple cases of failure during 
its clinical practice in India. A modified design of the polycentric knee has 
been proposed based on the findings of failure analysis. Simulation-based 
comparative analysis of polycentric knees has been performed as per the ISO 
10328:2016 standard in terms of stress distribution, total contour deformation, 
safety factor, and fatigue life. The upper extension lever is subjected to 
static and cyclic loads of 4130 and 1230 N, whereas the lower plate has a 
translational constraint. The modified polycentric knee prosthesis outperforms 
static and fatigue strength tests. The standard of the existing knee prosthesis 
has significantly improved as a result of design variations and integration of 
high-strength and lightweight aluminium 7075-T6 alloy. The modified polycentric 
knee prosthesis has a predicted maximum deformation of less than 0.7 mm and a 
minimum safety factor between 1.7 and 2 compared to 2.66 mm and 1.0 for the 
existing knee prosthesis. Based on the fatigue simulation results, it is 
predicted that the modified polycentric knee will have a lifespan of at least 
ten years indicating a safe design. It has improved alignment stability and 
kinematics, with a significant weight reduction of 33 g, and a high cost-benefit 
ratio to reach the maximum amputee population in low-income countries like 
India.

OBJECTIVES: Using risk models as eligibility criteria for lung screening can 
reduce race and sex-based disparities. We used data from the International Lung 
Screening Trial(ILST; NCT02871856) to compare the economic impact of using the 
PLCOm2012 risk model or the US Preventative Services' categorical age-smoking 
history-based criteria (USPSTF-2013).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of using PLCOm2012 versus 
USPSTF-2013 was evaluated with a decision analytic model based on the ILST and 
other screening trials. The primary outcomes were costs in 2020 International 
Dollars ($), quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental net benefit 
(INB, in $ per QALY). Secondary outcomes were selection characteristics and 
cancer detection rates (CDR).
RESULTS: Compared with the USPSTF-2013 criteria, the PLCOm2012 risk model 
resulted in $355 of cost savings per 0.2 QALYs gained (INB=$4294 at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $20 000/QALY (95 %CI: $4205-$4383). Using the 
risk model was more cost-effective in females at both a 1.5 % and 1.7 % 6-year 
risk threshold (INB=$6616 and $6112, respectively), compared with males ($5221 
and $695). The PLCOm2012 model selected more females, more individuals with 
fewer years of formal education, and more people with other respiratory 
illnesses in the ILST. The CDR with the risk model was higher in females 
compared with the USPSTF-2013 criteria (Risk Ratio = 7.67, 95 % CI: 1.87-31.38).
CONCLUSION: The PLCOm2012 model saved costs, increased QALYs and mitigated 
socioeconomic and sex-based disparities in access to screening.

Theca cells (TCs) play a unique role in the structure and function of the ovary. 
They are not only the structural basis of the follicle but also the 
androgen-secreting cells in female mammals, which can affect the normal 
development and atresia of the follicle. The results showed that melatonin 
receptor (MTR) MT1 and MT2 were expressed on sheep TCs. In the present study, 
the effects of different concentrations of MT at 0, 10-10, 10-8, 10-6 and 
10-4 M/L on sheep TCs with regards to the antioxidant levels, proliferation, 
apoptosis and steroid hormone secretion were investigated. The results showed 
that in sheep TCs, all concentrations of MT significantly decreased reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) concentration and BAX expression; increased Cat, Sod1, and 
BCL-2 expression. The proliferation viability of TCs was significantly inhibited 
in all groups except for 10-10 M/L MT, and the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 
was significantly reduced. MT significantly increased StAR expression and 
progesterone secretion in TCs, but there was no significant effect on androgen 
secretion and CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and 3β-HSD expression in all groups. MT-induced 
progesterone secretion was completely inhibited by Luzindole (a nonspecific MT1 
and MT2 inhibitor) and partially inhibited by 4p-PDOT (specific MT2 inhibitor). 
MT-induced progesterone secretion can be inhibited by LY294002 (PI3K/AKT pathway 
inhibitor). This study indicated that MT inhibits apoptosis and proliferation of 
in vitro cultured sheep TCs, which has implications for slowing ovarian atresia 
and aging. MT activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to mediate the synthesis and 
secretion of progesterone by TCs. This study provides a basis for further 
exploration of the role of TCs on follicle development and ovarian steroid 
hormone secretion.

The versatile applicability of rare earth elements (REEs) especially lanthanum 
(La) in diverse fields, has led to large-scale mineral exploitation globally, 
inevitably resulting in substantial release of La into environment. As emerging 
anthropogenic environmental contaminant, La-induced toxicological effects and 
potential ecotoxicological implications in relation to realistic levels of La in 
aquatic ecosystems are becoming major concerns. To address these issues, Daphnia 
magna was selected as a prototype, and toxicity tests were conducted to explore 
the effects of La exposure on life-history characteristics and fecundity 
fitness, as showcased by quantitative variations from the individual level to 
population scale. In parallel, to further denote transgenerational caloric 
impacts of parental La exposure, bioenergetic profiles on newborn neonates were 
concurrently determined by measuring macromolecule forms in terms of proteins, 
glycogens and lipids to quantify nutritional alterations at progeny level. The 
results revealed that low-dose La exposure slightly stimulated the demographic 
potential and nutritional responses, exhibiting dose-dependent hormesis-like 
effects and promising non-toxicological potential to Daphnia, whereas high-dose 
La exposure of greater than 59.2 µg La L - 1, conspicuously imposed detrimental 
effects on quantity and quality of offspring, i.e. not only reducing body size, 
lifespan expectancy and reproductive output in a concentration-dependent way and 
resulting in lower population fitness by a dynamic life-table analysis, but 
eventually leading to the decrease of nutritional qualities and caloric contents 
on neonates. Taken together, these two-phase findings regarding the dose-related 
shift from hormesis to inhibition not only provided valuable insights into the 
complicated biological outcomes of La effects on environmentally-relevant 
organisms, but experimentally highlighted the significant implications of 
considering environmental and nutritional consequences in ecologically assessing 
the La-triggered risk at environmentally realistic occurrences, particularly on 
gradient scenarios crossing upstream and downstream of highly complex mining 
watersheds.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy of older adults continues to increase; 
however, knowledge regarding their total energy requirements is lacking. This 
study aimed to compare the total energy expenditure (TEE) of older adults ≥80 
years measured using doubly labelled water (DLW), with estimated TEE. The 
hypothesis was that the Mifflin, Ikeda, and Livingston equations will more 
closely estimate energy requirements than the commonly used Schofield equation.
METHODS: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and TEE were measured using the reference 
methods of indirect calorimetry and DLW, respectively. Bland-Altman plots 
compared measured RMR and TEE with predicted RMR using equations (Mifflin, 
Ikeda, Livingston, Schofield) and predicted TEE (predicted RMR × physical 
activity level).
RESULTS: Twenty-one older adults (age range 80.7-90.1 years, BMI 26.1 ± 5.5 
kg/m2) were included. The Schofield equation demonstrated the greatest bias from 
measured RMR, overestimating approximately up to double the mean difference (865 
± 662 kJ/day) compared with the three other equations. The Schofield equation 
exhibited the greatest bias (overestimation of 641 ± 1,066 kJ/day) compared with 
measured TEE. The other three equations underestimated TEE, with the least bias 
from Ikeda (37 ± 1,103 kJ/day), followed by Livingston (251 ± 1,108 kJ/day), and 
Mifflin (354 ± 1,140 kJ/day). Data are mean ± SD.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults ≥80 years, the Ikeda, Mifflin, and Livingston 
equations provide closer estimates of TEE than the widely used Schofield 
equation. The development of nutrition guidelines therefore should consider the 
utilization of equations which more accurately reflect age-specific 
requirements.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related bone disease (CFBD) is seen in adults 
and can be associated with respiratory illness and malnutrition. There is 
limited and conflicting data regarding CFBD in pediatric CF. With longer life 
expectancy and promotion of disease prevention, pediatric CFBD demands further 
investigation.
METHODS: Our center initiated a quality improvement (QI) project from April 2016 
to December 2018 to improve CFBD screening in patients 8 years or older, per 
current CF Foundation (CFF) guidelines. Our team formulated a dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scan algorithm based upon degree of bone mineral density 
(BMD); shared CFBD guideline recommendations in our quarterly newsletter; and 
ordered scans for eligible patients at weekly review meetings. We reviewed DXA 
results from 141 patients after institutional review board approval and gathered 
data including comorbidities, genetics, anthropometric measures, medication 
exposure, and relevant serum studies.
RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of our patients had normal BMD (n = 75). Seventeen 
patients (12%) had a Z score ≤ -2. Patients with lower BMD also had lower mean 
forced expiratory volume (FEV1 ) percent predicted (FEV1 %) (p < 0.001) as well 
as lower body mass index % (p = 0.001). Patients with lower BMD were overall 
older at time of DXA (p = 0.016). During study duration, 13 patients who had 
abnormal DXA results underwent repeat DXAs after physical therapy; 11 of the 13 
showed improvement in DXA results.
CONCLUSIONS: A DXA scan is a useful screening tool and can be used to identify 
pediatric patients who could benefit from further therapy and interventions to 
preserve adequate bone health and avoid further loss. QI initiatives can lead to 
improved screening and diagnosis and earlier intervention such as physical 
therapy. Further studies are needed to better understand the utility of physical 
therapy in children with CF.

Over the last century, there has been a gradual but sustained increase in life 
expectancy globally. A consequence of increased life expectancy is an associated 
rise in the prevalence of agerelated chronic debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Huntington's 
disease, and multiple sclerosis. These disorders, which are generally 
characterised by the loss of motor/sensory neurons and cognitive decline, have 
continued to confound researchers who are working tirelessly to define their 
pathogenetic mechanisms and develop effective therapies. In the last few years,
