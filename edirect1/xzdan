BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare three small-area level mortality metrics 
according to urbanity in Korea: the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), 
comparative mortality figure (CMF), and life expectancy (LE) by urbanity.
METHODS: We utilized the National Health Information Database to obtain annual 
small-area level age-specific numbers of population and deaths in Korea between 
2013 and 2017. First, differences in the SMR by urbanity were examined, assuming 
the same age-specific mortality rates in all small areas. Second, we explored 
the differences in ranking obtained using the three metrics (SMR, CMF, and LE). 
Third, the ratio of CMF to SMR by population was analyzed according to urbanity.
RESULTS: We found that the age-specific population distributions in urbanized 
areas were similar, but rural areas had a relatively old population structure. 
The age-specific mortality ratio also differed by urbanity. Assuming the same 
rate of age-specific mortality across all small areas, we found that comparable 
median values in all areas. However, areas with a high SMR showed a strong 
predominance of metropolitan areas. The ranking by SMR differed markedly from 
the rankings by CMF and LE, especially in areas of high mortality, while the 
latter two metrics did not differ notably. The ratio of CMF to SMR showed larger 
variations in small areas in rural areas, particularly in those with small 
populations, than in metropolitan and urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: In a comparison of multiple SMRs, bias could exist if the study 
areas have large differences in population structure. The use of CMF or LE 
should be considered for comparisons if it is possible to acquire age-specific 
mortality data for each small area.

Gout is currently the most frequent cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide. 
It results from elevated serum urate and subsequent deposition of monosodium 
urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While many patients with gout can be 
managed with conventional agents (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat), those with 
chronic refractory gout often fail to achieve treatment goals with these agents. 
Pegloticase is a recombinant, pegylated mammalian uricase developed for 
treatment of chronic refractory gout. Pegloticase is different than other urate 
lowering therapies in that it enzymatically degrades urate. Pegloticase has been 
evaluated in multiple studies, most importantly in two randomized controlled 
trials and a follow-up open-label extension. Extensive analysis of results from 
these studies has shown that pegloticase profoundly lowers serum urate, resolves 
tophi, reduces tender and swollen joint counts, decreases pain, and improves 
both patients' global assessments and quality of life. Pegloticase also 
significantly decreases blood pressure in patients with chronic refractory gout, 
but has no significant effect on renal function. Post hoc analyses of clinical 
results also indicated that chronic refractory gout patients not achieving 
sustained urate lowering still have significant clinical benefits with 
pegloticase treatment. The major limitation of pegloticase is immunogenicity and 
the emergence of anti-drug antibodies that result in increased drug clearance, 
loss of efficacy, and infusion reactions. However, these reactions can be 
avoided by stopping pegloticase when there is a loss of serum urate lowering. 
New dosing regimens and co-administration of immunosuppressive agents are also 
being employed to overcome this limitation and extend the benefits of 
pegloticase to a larger number of patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is 
overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells, and 765IGF-Methotrexate 
(IGF-MTX) is a conjugate of methotrexate and a variant of insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) designed to selectively target cancer cells through binding to 
IGF-1R. The aim of this study was to determine whether IGF-MTX would be 
effective to treat MDS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase I clinical trial, two patients with high 
grade MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (O-AML) that had failed 
standard therapy were treated with IGF-MTX.
RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Both patients had stable or 
improved cell counts and CD34+ myelodysplastic cell counts and exceeded their 
life expectancy (both alive at 1.9 years despite a life expectancy of less than 
6 months). Bone marrow blast counts decreased from 22% to 5% in one patient, and 
from 17% to 16% in the other.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, IGF-MTX at 0.20 μM equivalents per kg was well 
tolerated, caused no cytopenia, and produced stable disease and extension of 
life.

We analyze the age and sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths in 
Austria. In accordance with international studies, the Austrian data also 
suggests that the risk of death increases substantially with age. The observed 
age dependency of the proportions of registered COVID-19 deaths in relation to 
the population sizes in the age groups is approximately exponential, similar to 
the age dependency of the general age specific mortality rate. Furthermore, we 
compare the general age specific mortality rate in Austria with the estimates of 
the SARS-CoV‑2 infection fatality rate by Ferguson et al. (2020). The parallels 
to the general age specific mortality rates do not imply that COVID-19 does not 
pose an additional risk. On the contrary, it follows from the structure and 
magnitude of the infection fatality rate that it is substantial, especially for 
higher age groups. However, since in many cases persons with severe pre-existing 
conditions are affected, it is not yet possible to estimate what effects 
COVID-19 will have on life expectancy.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the Theileria and Babesia 
infection in sheep using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in Baneh, Iran. 
Theileria and Babesia are apicomplexan parasites that have both vertebral and 
invertebrate hosts. These protozoa, which are transmitted by tick vectors, are 
considered to be the most important causes of parasitic diseases in Iran.The 
detection methods of Babesia and Theileria spp. are morphological examination, 
serology tests, and more recently, molecular assays, such as PCR. In this study, 
a total of 66 blood samples were collected and analyzed using specific primers 
for Theileria annulata, T. ovis, T. lestoquardi, and Babesia ovis. Two PCR 
methods were used, namely semi-nested PCR and competitive PCR. Based on the 
results of the PCR assay of 66 sheep blood samples, B. ovis, T. ovis, T. 
lestoquardi, and T. annulata were detected in 57 (86.4%), 28 (42.4%), 0, and 16 
(24%) cases, respectively. Detection of low levels of protozoan infection with 
high morbidity in the tested animals shows their status as a carrier that keeps 
the infection in the region and extends the protozoan life cycle. Another 
important factor is the geographical situation of Baneh as a border city since 
the hemoprotozoan infection is present in this region. Moreover, piroplasmida 
infection was found in Iraq and other neighboring provinces. Therefore, animal 
husbandry in Baneh is at the risk of infection with Babesia and Theileria. The 
collected data in this study are useful for reaching a better understanding of 
the epizootiology of theileriosis and babesiosis, in order to control and 
prevent the diseases in this region.

OBJECTIVE: To identify studies that report three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical 
analysis of jump-landing tasks in relation to athletes with current patellar 
tendinopathy (PT), and/or asymptomatic with history of PT or patellar tendon 
abnormality (PTA) on diagnostic imaging.
METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched. Included articles were 
required to: (1) investigate the 3D biomechanics of a jump-landing task; (2) be 
cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; and (3) include participants that had 
symptomatic PT, were asymptomatic with a history of PT, asymptomatic with PTA on 
diagnostic imaging and/or asymptomatic with an unknown pathology or PT history.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven statistically significant jump-landing variables were 
associated with PT, history of PT and/or PTA. The only consistent variable that 
could be replicated between studies was knee flexion angle at initial 
foot-ground contact (IC) and an altered hip flexion/extension strategy during a 
horizontal land phase of a vertical stop-jump.
CONCLUSION: Isolated vertical landings or take-offs alone may not be sensitive 
enough to identify key jump-landing variables associated with PT, thus 
clinicians and researchers should incorporate a whole jump-landing task with a 
horizontal landing component. Sagital plane hip and knee kinematics in a 
horizontal landing phase appear to provide the most valuable information for 
evaluating those with PT.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and 
micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in 
bone fragility and fracture susceptibility. In an aged society with increased 
life expectancy, the incidence rate of osteoporosis is also rapidly increasing. 
Inadequate nutrition may negatively influence bone metabolism. Recently, many 
studies have investigated the functionality of milk-derived exosomes, which play 
important roles in cell-to-cell communication. However, there are few reports of 
how milk-derived exosomes influence osteoblast proliferation and 
differentiation. Here, we determined whether bovine colostrum-derived exosomes 
promote anti-osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo. Tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase-stained cells were significantly inhibited in Raw264.7 cells treated 
with exosomes, indicating reduced osteoclast differentiation. We induced 
osteoporosis in mice using glucocorticoid pellets after orally administering 
exosomes for 2 mo. Interestingly, the bone mineral density of exosome-fed mouse 
groups was significantly improved compared with the glucocorticoid-induced 
osteoporosis group without exosome treatment. In addition, Lactobacillus were 
decreased in the gut microbiota community of osteoporosis-induced mice, but the 
gut microbiota community composition was effectively restored by exosome intake. 
Taken together, we propose that exosomes isolated from bovine colostrum could be 
a potential candidate for osteoporosis prevention, bone remodeling improvement, 
and inhibition of bone resorption. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 
a protective effect of milk exosomes against osteoporosis has been demonstrated 
in vivo. Our results strongly suggest that bovine colostrum exosomes might be 
used as a prophylaxis to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Indeed, our results 
offer promising alternative strategies in the nutritional management of 
age-related bone complications.

AIM: Transcription factor CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) is a key 
regulator of myeloid differentiation, granulopoiesis in particular. Although 
CEBPA mutations are found in more than 10% in AML, functional inhibition of 
C/EBPα protein is also widely observed in AML. Here, we sought to examine if 
SKP2, an aberrantly enhanced E3 ubiquitin ligase in primary AMLs inhibits C/EBPα 
stability to induce differentiation block.
MAIN METHODS: Here we employed cell based assays such as transfections, 
immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, luciferase and gel shift assays along 
with differentiation assays to investigate SKP2 regulated C/EBPα protein 
stability in acute myeloid leukemia.
KEY FINDINGS: Here we discovered that oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFskp2 
ubiquitinates and destabilizes C/EBPα in a proteasome-dependent manner. Our data 
demonstrates that SKP2 physically interacts with C-terminal of C/EBPα and 
promotes its K48-linked ubiquitination-mediated degradation leading to its 
reduced transactivation potential, DNA binding ability and cellular functions. 
We further show that while overexpression of SKP2 inhibits both ectopic as well 
as endogenous C/EBPα in heterologous (HEK293T) as well as myeloid leukemia cells 
respectively, SKP2 depletion restores endogenous C/EBPα leading to reduced 
colony formation and enhanced myeloid differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. 
Using Estradiol-inducible K562-C/EBPα-ER cells as yet another model of 
granulocytic differentiation, we further confirmed that SKP2 overexpression 
indeed inhibits granulocytic differentiation by mitigating C/EBPα stability.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings identify SKP2 as a potential negative regulator of 
C/EBPα stability and function in AML which suggests that SKP2 can be potentially 
targeted in AML to restore C/EBPα and overcome differentiation block.

Children at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) receive implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) for prevention, but the cost effectiveness of 
ICDs in children at intermediate risk is unclear. Our objective was to create a 
cost-effectiveness model to compare costs and outcomes in children at risk of 
SCD, with and without ICD. Utilizing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the proxy 
disease, a theoretical cohort of 8150 children was followed for 69 years. Model 
inputs were derived from the literature, with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) used to delineate cost effectiveness. Outcomes included prevalence of 
severe neurological morbidity (SNM), SCD, cost, and QALYs. In children at 
intermediate risk of SCD (4-6% over 5 years), ICD resulted in 56 fewer cases of 
SNM, 2686 fewer deaths. In children at high risk (> 6% over 5 years), ICD 
placement resulted in 74 fewer cases of SNM and 3663 fewer deaths from cardiac 
causes. The costs of ICD were higher, but placement was cost effective with an 
ICER of $3009 per QALY in intermediate risk children, but ICD therapy was a 
dominant strategy in high-risk children. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated ICD 
placement was cost-effective until the annual probability of SCD was < 0.22%. 
The model was robust over a wide range of values. For children at risk of SCD, 
prophylactic ICD implantation is cost effective, resulting in improved outcomes 
and increased QALYs, despite increased costs. These findings highlight the 
economic benefits of ICD utilization in this population.

Certain replication-blocking lesions can escape DNA repair and must be bypassed 
to prevent fork collapse and cell death. Budding yeast DNA-damage tolerance 
consists of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and template switch. TLS utilizes 
specialized DNA polymerases to insert nucleotides opposite the damage site, 
followed by extension, allowing continual replication in the presence of lesions 
on the template DNA. Meanwhile, Rev1 is additionally required for the subsequent 
extension step of TLS regardless of the initial insertion polymerase utilized. 
Here we assess relative contributions of two Y-family TLS polymerases, Rev1 and 
Polη, in bypassing lesions induced by various types of DNA-damaging agents. Our 
experimental results collectively indicate that yeast cells preferentially 
utilize relatively error-free TLS polymerase(s) to bypass given lesions, and 
that the mutagenic TLS polymerase may serve as a backup. Interestingly, if Polη 
is unable to serve as a TLS polymerase under certain circumstances, it may be 
counter-active. The cooperation among TLS polymerases may strike a balance 
between survival and stress-induced mutagenesis. These observations indicate 
that specialized Y-family DNA polymerases have evolved to deal with different 
types of environmental genotoxic stresses.

BACKGROUND: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) are key enzymes 
associated with shelf life and defense responses. Thus, the activity of PPO and 
POD enzymes is usually assessed to check the quality of food samples and to 
understand the physiological responses of plants to different stresses. However, 
the outcomes of PPO and POD activity assessment studies are highly dependent on 
assay conditions. Hence, in this study, we initially optimized PPO and POD 
extraction and high-throughput 96-well plates-based enzymatic activity 
assessment methods to evaluate the inhibitory potential of tomato volatile 
compounds. Later, we explored the effects of net-house and open-field growing on 
the PPO and POD activity in tomato fruits of eight cultivars.
RESULTS: We found 150 mM of catechol and pH 7.0 were the optimal conditions for 
the maximum activity for the PPO assay. Conversely, 24 mM guaiacol with 12 mM H2 
O2 and pH 6.0 was the best condition for the POD assay. Thermal inactivation 
studies confirmed that tomato POD is more resistant to heat than PPO. We found 
that the production systems had a considerable genotype-specific impact on 
tomato PPO and POD activity. Moreover, amongst the volatiles that were studied, 
β-damascenone and d-limonene showed 50% PPO inhibition at 40 and 80 mM, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study can be used to improve the shelf-life of 
fresh tomato fruit and its products. The findings also underscore the 
significance of PPO and POD enzymes as physiological trait markers in the tomato 
crop and fruit quality improvement programs. © 2020 Society of Chemical

Background: Vast increases in life expectancy over the last century have led to 
shifts in population demographics and the emergence of a largely aged 
population, globally. This has led to a need to understand neurobiological 
changes associated with healthy aging. Studies on age-related changes in 
functional connectivity networks have largely been cross-sectional and focused 
on the default mode network (DMN). The current study investigated longitudinal 
changes in functional connectivity in multiple resting-state networks over 4 
years of aging in cognitively normal older adults. Methods: Resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging scans from older adults (n = 16) who 
maintained "cognitive normal" status over 4 years were retrieved at baseline and 
follow-up from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. A 
seed-based approach was executed in Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library 
(FSL) to examine significant changes in functional connectivity within the DMN, 
frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) within subjects over 
time. Results: Results indicated significantly (p < 0.05, corrected) reduced 
functional connectivity in the FPN and SN, but not in the DMN at year 4 compared 
with baseline in older adults who were cognitively stable. Conclusions: The 
current study highlights the importance of a longitudinal approach for 
understanding changes in functional connectivity. The findings also underscore 
the need to examine multiple networks within the same participants, given that 
changes were apparent in the FPN and SN but not in the DMN. Future studies 
should also examine changes in internetwork connectivity as well as shifts in 
structural connectivity over time. Impact statement Investigations of 
age-related changes in functional connectivity have largely been cross-sectional 
and focused on the default mode network (DMN). The current study examined the 
DMN as well as the frontoparietal network (FN) and salience network (SN), in a 
group of healthy aging adults over four years. The results revealed decreased 
functional connectivity over time, in the FN and SN, but not the DMN. These 
findings provide insights about the healthy aging brain. They also underscore 
the need to broaden the scope of functional connectivity analyses beyond the DMN 
and highlight the use of longitudinal methods.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy of men with prostate cancer (CaP)improves, the 
risks of chronic diseases and comorbid conditions become more relevant. 
Improving modifiable health behaviors now serves as a focus of guidelines to 
reduce all-cause morbidity and mortality from chronic disease among CaP 
survivors. Few studies have reported on these health behaviors in low-income, 
uninsured men with CaP METHODS: In addition to baseline demographic data, we 
collected four health behaviors in low-income men with CaP via telephone survey: 
physical activity, dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, weight management, 
and alcohol consumption. These behaviors were assessed for adherence to the 
American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines for health 
promotion.
RESULTS: Of 236 participants, most self-identified as racial/ethnic minority 
(61% Hispanic, 16% Black). Most men demonstrated low (21%) or moderate (66%) 
adherence to guidelines, almost all of whom had poor adherence with 
recommendations for physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. 
Multivariate analysis showed that non-white men were more likely to demonstrate 
low or moderate adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Most men in this cohort of low-income, uninsured CaP survivors did 
not engage the healthy behaviors promulgated by the American Cancer Society. 
Future interventions in this population should focus on encouraging and 
facilitating healthier lifestyle choices in physical activity, diet, and weight 
management.

Kriging with trend functions nonlinear in their parameters: Theory and 
application in enzyme kinetics.

Kriging is an interpolation method commonly applied in empirical modeling for 
approximating functional relationships between impact factors and system 
response. The interpolation is based on a statistical analysis of given data and 
can optionally include a priori defined trend functions. However, Kriging can so 
far only be used with trend functions that are linear with respect to the 
parameters. In this contribution, we present an extension of the Kriging 
approach for handling trend functions that are nonlinear in their parameters. 
Our approach is based on Taylor linearization combined with an iterative 
parameter estimation procedure whose solution is practically computed via a root 
finding problem. We demonstrate our novel approach with measurement data from 
the application field of biocatalysis.

NAD(P)+ dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is an oxidoreductase used as a 
biocatalyst to regenerate NAD(P)H in reductase-mediated chiral synthesis 
reactions. Solvent stability and the need to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, due to the 
high cost of NADPH, are required features in the industrial usage of FDHs. 
Therefore, we aimed to identify a novel, robust NADP+ dependent FDH and evaluate 
the effect of N- and C- terminus His tag extensions on protein solubility and 
activity. Herein, we report a novel, DMSO tolerant formate dehydrogenase 
(BdFDH), which has dual coenzyme specificity and tolerance to acidic pH, from 
Burkholderia dolosa PC543. N- and C-terminus His-tagged BdFDHs were expressed 
separately in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The C-terminal His-tagged BdFDH was 
soluble and active whereas the N-terminal version was not. The enzyme displays 
dual coenzyme specificity and resistance to some organic solvents, particularly 
DMSO, and is able to tolerate acidic pH conditions. The apparent KM values for 
NADP+, NAD+ and sodium formate (with NADP+), are 1.17, 14.7 and 5.66 mM, 
respectively. As a result, due to its DMSO tolerance and coenzyme preference, 
this enzyme can be utilized as an NAD(P)H recycler in several biotransformations 
particularly when carried out under acidic conditions. Moreover, it can be said 
that the position of the His tag extension may affect the enzyme solubility and 
functionality.

Life expectancy improvement for multiple cure distributions.

Naik S(1), Adamic P(1).

Author information:
(1)Laurentian University, Sudbury, Canada.

In many circumstances, the increase in life expectancy when certain causes of 
death are eliminated is sought. These calculations are typically based on the 
assumption that the causes in question are simply omitted, which is equivalent 
to the causes being taken out of consideration, from the outset, with certainty. 
In this paper, we propose models whereby probability distributions for the cures 
of specific causes of death over time can be incorporated so as to more 
accurately predict the increase in life expectancy that would ensue. The 
theoretical results are applied to a real data set involving Diabetes and 
HIV-related deaths from Denver, Colorado, United States of America, between the 
years 1990 and 2015 inclusive.

BACKGROUND: Advances in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and changes in 
general life expectancy may have improved survival in patients with PD.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate recent trends in PD 
mortality.
METHODS: In total, 1521 patients with PD in local and national registries were 
followed for 11 years (2006-2016) from diagnosis until exit date or death, and 
the causes of death were recorded.
RESULTS: The survival of men with PD improved during the follow-up period, but 
no change was observed in women (2-year postdiagnosis survival in men, 
79.0%-86.3%, P = 0.03; 2-year postdiagnosis survival in women, 82.8%-87.5%, P = 
0.42). Pneumonia was the most common immediate cause of death.
DISCUSSION: The survival of men with PD has improved in Finland without a 
similar change in women. Because changes in treatment likely affect both sexes 
similarly, the results may reflect the decreasing sex gap in life expectancy. 
This phenomenon will likely increase the already high male-to-female prevalence 
ratio of PD.

AIM: To report an analysis of ~1 year of setmelanotide treatment for obesity and 
hunger, as well as metabolic and cardiac outcomes, in individuals with 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals aged 12 years and older with BBS received 
once-daily setmelanotide. The dose was titrated every 2 weeks to establish the 
individual therapeutic dose (≤3 mg); treatment continued for an additional 
10 weeks. Participants who lost 5 kg or more (or ≥5% of body weight if <100 kg 
at baseline) continued into the 52-week extension phase. The primary outcome was 
mean percent change from baseline in body weight at 3 months. Hunger scores and 
safety were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: From February 2017 and February 2018, 10 individuals were screened; 
eight completed the 3-month treatment phase and seven completed the extension 
phase. Mean percent change in body weight from baseline to 3 months was -5.5% 
(90% CI, -9.3% to -1.6%; n = 8); change from baseline was -11.3% (90% CI, -15.5% 
to -7.0%; n = 8) at 6 months and -16.3% (90% CI, -19.9% to -12.8%; n = 7) at 
12 months. All participants reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse 
event (AE), most commonly injection-site reaction. No AEs led to study 
withdrawal or death. Most, morning, and average hunger scores were reduced 
across time points.
CONCLUSIONS: Setmelanotide reduced body weight and hunger in individuals with 
BBS and had a safety profile consistent with previous reports. Setmelanotide may 
be a treatment option in individuals with BBS-associated obesity and 
hyperphagia.

Brain function has been implicated to control the aging process and modulate 
lifespan. However, continuous efforts remain for the identification of the 
minimal sufficient brain region and the underlying mechanism for neuronal 
regulation of longevity. Here, we show that the Drosophila lifespan is modulated 
by rab27 functioning in a small subset of neurons of the mushroom bodies (MB), a 
brain structure that shares analogous functions with mammalian hippocampus and 
hypothalamus. Depleting rab27 in the α/βp neurons of the MB is sufficient to 
extend lifespan, enhance systemic stress responses, and alter energy 
homeostasis, all without trade-offs in major life functions. Within the α/βp 
neurons, rab27KO causes the mislocalization of phosphorylated S6K thus 
attenuates TOR signaling, resulting in decreased protein synthesis and reduced 
neuronal activity. Consistently, expression of dominant-negative S6K in the α/βp 
neurons increases lifespan. Furthermore, the expression of phospho-mimetic S6 in 
α/βp neurons of rab27KO rescued local protein synthesis and reversed lifespan 
extension. These findings demonstrate that inhibiting TOR-mediated protein 
synthesis in α/βp neurons is sufficient to promote longevity.

BACKGROUND: Many elderly localized prostate cancer patients could benefit from 
conservative management (CM). This retrospective cohort study examined the 
associations of patient-reported access to care and multimorbidity on CM use 
patterns among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries with localized 
prostate cancer.
METHODS: We used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer 
Registry, Medicare Claims, and the Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (MCAHPS) survey files. We identified FFS Medicare 
Beneficiaries (age ≥ 66; continuous enrollment in Parts A & B) 
with incident localized prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013 and a completed MCAHPS 
survey measuring patient-reported experiences of care within 24 months after 
diagnosis (n = 496). We used multivariable models to examine MCAHPS measures 
(getting needed care, timeliness of care, and doctor communication) and 
multimorbidity on CM use.
RESULTS: Localized prostate cancer patients with multimorbidity were less likely 
to use CM (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.42 (0.27- 0.66), P < .001); those with 
higher scores on timeliness of care (AOR = 1.21 (1.09, 1.35), P < .001), higher 
education attainment (3.21 = AOR (1.50,6.89), P = .003), and impaired mental 
health status (4.32 = AOR (1.86, 10.1) P < .001) were more likely to use CM.
CONCLUSION(S): Patient-reported experience with timely care was significantly 
and positively associated with CM use. Multimorbidity was significantly and 
inversely associated with CM use. Addressing specific modifiable barriers to 
timely care along the cancer continuum for elderly localized prostate cancer 
patients with limited life expectancy could reduce the adverse effects of 
overtreatment on health outcomes and costs.

BACKGROUND: Early and intensive glycaemic control provides long-term protection 
against the development of microvascular complications, a phenomenon defined 
legacy effect. Whether a legacy effect of high glucose exists also on 
macrovascular endpoints is uncertain.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic review of both randomized 
clinical trials (RCT)s and observational studies pertinent to the research 
question. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane database up to 
January 31th 2020. Eligibility criteria for RCTs were: 1 - efficacy assessment 
of intensive glucose lowering treatment vs a less-stringent/conventional 
treatment; 2 - the inclusion of a post-active phase, observational follow-up; 3 
- enrolment of patients with T1DM, pre-diabetes, and T2DM; and 4 - data report 
on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence, which was the primary 
endpoint of this meta-analysis. We performed multiple meta-analyses of the 
available RCTs according to different scenarios considering the type of 
diabetes, diabetes duration, the presence of previous cardiovascular events, 
follow-up extension, and the incidence of MACE recorded only during the 
observational, post-active phase of the trials. Results from observational 
studies reporting the association between HbA1c levels during the first year 
after diabetes diagnosis and subsequent MACE incidence were also collected and 
are reported narratively. We included data from 7 RCTs and 40,346 patients. The 
intensive glucose-lowering approach significantly decrease the incidence of MACE 
compared with conventional treatment (OR 0.86, CI 0.77-0.96; p = 0.007) when 
considering all the available studies, with a more consistent effect (OR 0.73, 
CI 0.56-0.94; p = 0.01) in the case of RCTs enrolling patients with diabetes 
duration <10 years, and an even more pronounced protection (OR 0.64, 48 CI 0.48, 
0.86; p = 0.003) when analysing only RCTs enrolling patients without previous 
cardiovascular events at baseline. Considering only RCTs with a post-trial 
follow-up >10 years also yielded a relevant beneficial effect of the intensive 
approach (OR 0.71, CI 0.57, 0.88; p = 0.002). On the other hand, no effect was 
observed (OR 0.99, CI 0.92, 1.06; p = 0.81) when considering only the events 
recorded during the post-active, observational phases of the trials. 
Observational studies showed that HbA1c values >6.5% or 7% during the first year 
of diabetes diagnosis are associated with a higher incidence of late MACE with 
increased risk ranging from 19 up to 64%, according to the different study 
design and HbA1c stratification.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the recommendation regarding glucose-lowering 
treatment intensification in order to decrease the probability of having a 
macrovascular event in patients with short diabetes duration, no prevalent 
cardiovascular diseases, and long life-expectancy. On the other side, data from 
RCTs do not support the existence of a protective legacy effect on the 
macrovasculature beyond the period of intensive glycaemic treatment.
