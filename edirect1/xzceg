Progressive fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterised by 
major reductions in quality of life and survival and have similarities to 
certain malignancies. However, palliative care expertise is conspicuously 
inaccessible to many patients with ILD. Unmet patient and caregiver needs 
include effective pharmacological and psychosocial interventions to improve 
quality of life throughout the disease course, sensitive advanced care planning, 
and timely patient-centred end-of-life care. The incorrect perception that 
palliative care is synonymous with end-of-life care, with no role earlier in the 
course of ILD, has created a culture of neglect. Interventions that aim to 
improve life expectancy are often prioritised without rigorous assessment of the 
individual's health and psychosocial needs, thereby inadvertently reducing 
quality of life. As in malignant disorders, radical interventions to slow 
disease progression and palliative measures to improve quality of life should 
both be prioritised. Efficient patient-centred models of palliative care must be 
validated, taking into account religious and cultural differences, as well as 
variability of resources. Effective implementation of palliative care for ILD 
will require multidisciplinary participation from clinicians, specialist nurses, 
psychologists, social workers, and, in some countries, non-governmental faith 
and community-based organisations with access to palliative care expertise.

OBJECTIVES: There is increasing interest in studies that examine patient 
preferences to measure health-related outcomes. Understanding patients' 
preferences can improve the treatment process and is particularly relevant for 
oncology. In this study, we aimed to identify the subgroup-specific treatment 
preferences of German patients with lung cancer (LC) or colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: Six discrete choice experiment (DCE) attributes were established on the 
basis of a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews. The DCE 
analyses comprised generalized linear mixed-effects model and latent class mixed 
logit model.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 310 patients (194 with LC, 108 with CRC, 8 
with both types of cancer) with a median age of 63 (SD =10.66) years. The 
generalized linear mixed-effects model showed a significant (P<0.05) degree of 
association for all of the tested attributes. "Strongly increased life 
expectancy" was the attribute given the greatest weight by all patient groups. 
Using latent class mixed logit model analysis, we identified three classes of 
patients. Patients who were better informed tended to prefer a more balanced 
relationship between length and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than 
those who were less informed. Class 2 (LC patients with low HRQoL who had 
undergone surgery) gave a very strong weighting to increased length of life. We 
deduced from Class 3 patients that those with a relatively good life expectancy 
(CRC compared with LC) gave a greater weight to moderate effects on HRQoL than 
to a longer life.
CONCLUSION: Overall survival was the most important attribute of therapy for 
patients with LC or CRC. Differences in treatment preferences between subgroups 
should be considered in regard to treatment and development of guidelines. 
Patients' preferences were not affected by sex or age, but were affected by the 
cancer type, HRQoL, surgery status, and the main source of information on the 
disease.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most diagnosed cancer in men. Early 
diagnosis and right management of PCa is critical to reducing deaths; the life 
expectancy is the main factors to be considered in the management of PCa. Among 
patients who die from PCa, the incidence of skeletal involvement appears to be 
>85%. Bone scan (BS) is the most common method for monitoring bone metastases in 
patients with PCa. The extent of bone metastasis was also associated with 
patient survival until now there is no clinically useful technique for measuring 
bone tumors and includes this information in the risk assessment. An alternative 
approach is to calculate a BS index (BSI) and it has shown clinical significance 
as a prognostic imaging biomarker. Some computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) 
systems have been developed to measure BSI and are now available. The aim of 
this study was to investigate automated BSI (aBSI) measurements as predictors' 
survival in PCa. Retrospectively cohort studied fifty patients with PCa who had 
undergone BS between January 2010 and December 2011 at our institution. All data 
collected was updated up to August 2016. CAD system analyzing BS images to 
automatically compute BSI measurements. Patients were stratified into three BSI 
categories BSI value 0, BSI value ≤1 and BSI value >1. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
the survival function and the log-rank test were used to indicate a significant 
difference between groups stratified in accordance with the BSI values. A total 
of 35 subjects deaths were registered, with a median survival time 36 months 
after the follow-up BS of 5 years. Subjects with low aBSI value had longer 
overall survival in comparison with the other subjects (P = 0.004). aBSI 
measurements were shown to be a strong prognostic survival indicator in PCa; 
survival is poor in high-BSI value.

Current Perspective on Hemodialysis Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease.

Author information:

The prevalence of peripheral artery disease is substantially higher in patients 
on chronic hemodialysis than in the general population. The presence of 
calcified lesions characteristic of hemodialysis patients has an adverse 
influence on the initial success and long-term outcomes of both surgical bypass 
and endovascular therapy. Although the selection of revascularization strategy 
depends on whether an autologous vein is available and if the patient has a life 
expectancy of at least two years, it is difficult to predict the life expectancy 
in a real-world clinical situation. Endovascular therapy may be appropriate for 
many hemodialysis patients with poor general condition because of the high risk 
of perioperative complications and the poor long-term prognosis. Deciding which 
treatment option is more appropriate should be done on a case-by-case basis, 
especially in hemodialysis patients with critical limb ischemia.

Enamel formation front (EFF) angles represent the leading edge of enamel matrix 
secretion at particular points in time. These angles are influenced by rates of 
enamel extension (the rates at which tooth crowns grow in height), rates of 
enamel matrix secretion and the angles that prisms make with the enamel-dentine 
junction. Previous research suggests, but has not yet established, that these 
angles reflect aspects of primate biology related to their pace of growth and 
development, most notably brain and body size. The present study tested this 
possibility on histological sections using phylogenetically-controlled and 
Bonferroni-corrected analyses spanning a broad taxonomic range. Ten species were 
represented in the analysis of anterior teeth; 17 in the analysis of posterior 
(postcanine) teeth (with varying sample sizes). Also, tested was the 
relationship of EFF angles to striae of Retzius periodicity (long period growth 
rhythms in enamel) and degree of folivory, as both factors are related to 
primate developmental rates. Finally, several analyses were conducted to 
investigate whether tooth size (operationalized as EDJ length) might mediate 
these relationships. Central results are as follows: (1) Relationships between 
EFF angles and brain weight (anterior teeth) and between EFF angles and body 
mass (anterior and posterior teeth) are statistically significant and (2) 
Mid-crown EFF angles are not statistically significantly related to EDJ lengths. 
These results suggest that tooth size does not mediate relationships between EFF 
angles and brain weight/body mass and are discussed with respect to underlying 
enamel growth variables (especially rates of enamel extension and secretion).

Endocarditis of a prosthetic heart valve is a life-threatening condition that is 
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Perivalvular extension in 
infective endocarditis includes complications such as periannular or 
intramyocardial abscesses, pseudoaneurysms and fistulae. The incidence of 
perivalvular extension ranges from 10 to 30% in native valve endocarditis and 30 
to 55% in prosthetic aortic-valve endocarditis. Herein, we describe a case of a 
66-year-old man who presented endocarditis of a prosthetic aortic valve 
complicated by infective pseudoaneurysm with localization next to the right 
coronary sinus of Valsalva. Moreover, we underscore the importance of the 
diagnostic imaging tools options and surgical timing.

Background. Recent research suggests that the health gain from economic 
resources and psychological assets may be systematically larger for Whites than 
Blacks. Aim. This study aimed to assess whether the life expectancy gain 
associated with social contacts over a long follow up differs for Blacks and 
Whites. Methods. Data came from the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) Study, 
1986-2011. The sample was a nationally representative sample of American adults 
25 and older, who were followed for up to 25 years (n = 3361). Outcome was 
all-cause mortality. The main predictor was social contacts defined as number of 
regular visits with friends, relatives, and neighbors. Baseline demographics 
(age and gender), socioeconomic status (education, income, and employment), 
health behaviors (smoking and drinking), and health (chronic medical conditions, 
obesity, and depressive symptoms) were controlled. Race was the focal moderator. 
Cox proportional hazard models were used in the pooled sample and based on race. 
Results. More social contacts predicted higher life expectancy in the pooled 
sample. A significant interaction was found between race and social contacts, 
suggesting that the protective effect of more social contacts is smaller for 
Blacks than Whites. In stratified models, more social contacts predicted an 
increased life expectancy for Whites but not Blacks. Conclusion. Social contacts 
increase life expectancy for White but not Black Americans. This study 
introduces social contacts as another social resource that differentially 
affects health of Whites and Blacks.

Impact of social inequalities at birth on the longevity of children born 
1914-1916: A cohort study.

Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.

BACKGROUND: Testing whether familial socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is 
a predictor of mortality has rarely been done on historical cohorts.
METHODS: The birth certificates of 4,805 individuals born 1914-1916 in 16 
districts of the Paris region were retrieved. The handwritten information 
provided the occupation of parents, the legitimacy status, life events (e.g. 
marriage, divorce), and the precise date of death when after 1945 (i.e. age 31 
years (y) in the cohort). We used the median age at death (MAD) as a global 
measure of mortality, then studied separately survival to and after 31 y. 
Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Generalized Additive Models 
(GAMs) and mixed effect Cox models were used.
RESULTS: MAD showed large variations according to paternal occupation. The 
lowest MAD in both sexes was that of workers' children: it was 56.3 y (95% CI: 
[48.6-62.7]) in men and 67.4 y (95% CI: [60.8-72.7]) in women, respectively (95% 
CI: 13.4 y [5.7-21.3]) and 12.3 y (95% CI: [4.0-19.2]) below the highest MAD 
attained. MAD experienced by illegitimate children was 18.9 y (95% CI: 
[13.3-32.3]) shorter than of legitimate children. The multivariate analysis 
revealed that in both sexes survival to age 31 y was predicted independently by 
legitimacy and paternal occupation. Paternal occupation was found significantly 
associated with mortality after age 31 y in females only: accordingly difference 
in life expectancy at age 31 y was 4.4 y (95% CI: [1.2-7.6]) between upper class 
and workers' daughters.
CONCLUSIONS: Paternal occupation and legitimacy status were strong predictors of 
offspring longevity in this one-century historical cohort born during World War 
One.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ixekizumab vs Etanercept and Their 
Manufacturer-Recommended Dosing Regimens in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis.

Udkoff J, Eichenfield LF.

INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis; 
however, their use is limited by costs. Ixekizumab was more effective than 
etanercept in the UNCOVER trials, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved ixekizumab for treating psoriasis. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 
these therapies is crucial for medical decision making and our objective was to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of various ixekizumab dosing frequencies 
compared with etanercept.
METHODS: We utilized published data from the UNCOVER comparative efficacy 
trials, including transitional probabilities and treatment response rates, to 
create a Markov model simulating the clinical course and cost-effectiveness of 
three treatment algorithms for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
over 60-weeks: (1) ixekizumab every 2 weeks for 12 weeks then every 4 weeks, (2) 
ixekizumab every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period, (3) biweekly 
etanercept for 12 weeks then once weekly. We utilized a standard 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) and Medicaid drug acquisition costs for our calculations.
RESULTS: Ixekizumab every 4 weeks was $28,681 (USD) less expensive than biweekly 
etanercept, and $21,375 less expensive, and 0.006 QALY less effective, than 
ixekizumab every 2 weeks-- a savings of $28.7 and $21.4 million, respectively, 
per 1,000 patients. A 95.6% cost reduction to $197.83 per dose is required for 
ixekizumab every 2 weeks to be more cost-effective than every 4 weeks. Biweekly 
etanercept requires a 29.5% cost reduction ($743.82 per dose) to be competitive 
with ixekizumab every 4 weeks.
DISCUSSION: This cost-effectiveness model utilizes strong input data but is a 
limited approximation of real-life scenarios. Treatment with ixekizumab every 2 
weeks is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with ixekizumab every 4 weeks at 
current U.S. market prices. Yet, the U.S. FDA approval and manufacturer's 
recommendation are for ixekizumab every 2 weeks. Accordingly, we suggested 
selecting biologic therapies using cost-effectiveness analyses. <p><em>J Drugs

BACKGROUND: This work aimed to explore whether different forms of a simple 
isometric exercise test could be used to predict the blood pressure 
(BP)-lowering efficacy of different types of isometric resistance training (IRT) 
in healthy young adults. In light of the emphasis on primary prevention of 
hypertension, identifying those with normal BP who will respond to IRT is 
important. Also, heightened BP reactivity increases hypertension risk, and as 
IRT reduces BP reactivity in patients with hypertension, it warrants further 
investigation in a healthy population.
METHODS: Forty-six young men and women (24 ± 5 years; 116 ± 10/ 68 ± 8 mm Hg) 
were recruited from 2 study sites: Windsor, Canada (n = 26; 13 women), and 
Northampton, United Kingdom (n = 20; 10 women). Resting BP and BP reactivity to 
an isometric exercise test were assessed prior to and following 10 weeks of 
thrice weekly IRT. Canadian participants trained on a handgrip dynamometer 
(isometric handgrip, IHG), while participants in the UK trained on an isometric 
leg extension dynamometer (ILE).
RESULTS: Men and women enrolled in both interventions demonstrated significant 
reductions in systolic BP (P < 0.001) and pulse pressure (P < 0.05). 
Additionally, test-induced systolic BP changes to IHG and ILE tests were 
associated with IHG and ILE training-induced reductions in systolic BP after 10 
weeks of training, respectively (r = 0.58 and r = 0.77; for IHG and ILE; P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The acute BP response to an isometric exercise test appears to be a 
viable tool to identify individuals who may respond to traditional IRT 
prescription.

We present eight patients with de novo, deleterious sequence variants in the 
PBX1 gene. PBX1 encodes a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain 
transcription factor that forms multimeric complexes with TALE and HOX proteins 
to regulate target gene transcription during development. As previously 
reported, Pbx1 homozygous mutant mice (Pbx1-/-) develop malformations and 
hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs, including the craniofacial skeleton, 
ear, branchial arches, heart, lungs, diaphragm, gut, kidneys, and gonads. 
Clinical findings similar to those in Pbx mutant mice were observed in all 
patients with varying expressivity and severity, including external ear 
anomalies, abnormal branchial arch derivatives, heart malformations, 
diaphragmatic hernia, renal hypoplasia and ambiguous genitalia. All patients but 
one had developmental delays. Previously reported patients with congenital 
anomalies affecting the kidney and urinary tract exhibited deletions and loss of 
function variants in PBX1. The sequence variants in our cases included missense 
substitutions adjacent to the PBX1 homeodomain (p.Arg184Pro, p.Met224Lys, and 
p.Arg227Pro) or within the homeodomain (p.Arg234Pro, and p.Arg235Gln), whereas 
p.Ser262Glnfs*2, and p.Arg288* yielded truncated PBX1 proteins. Functional 
studies on five PBX1 sequence variants revealed perturbation of intrinsic, 
PBX-dependent transactivation ability and altered nuclear translocation, 
suggesting abnormal interactions between mutant PBX1 proteins and wild-type TALE 
or HOX cofactors. It is likely that the mutations directly affect the 
transcription of PBX1 target genes to impact embryonic development. We conclude 
that deleterious sequence variants in PBX1 cause intellectual disability and 
pleiotropic malformations resembling those in Pbx1 mutant mice, arguing for 
strong conservation of gene function between these two species.

Objective: To analyze the burden of disease attributable to low fruit intake 
among Chinese population aged ≥15 years old between 1990 and 2013. Methods: We 
used data from the 2013 Global Burden of Disease Burden of Disease Study to 
study the situation in China. The population attributable fraction was 
calculated to estimate and compare the death and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY) attributed to low fruit intake between 1990 and 2013 in China (excluded 
Taiwan, China). An average world population age structure of the period 
2000-2025 was adopted to calculate age-standardized rates. Results: Deaths 
attributable to low fruit intake accounted for 11.02% of all death in 2013, 
which were higher than it in 1990 (10.38%). In 2013, the number of deaths 
attributed to low fruit intake in China increased to 1 046 500 from 793 800 in 
1990. From 1990-2013, the age-standardized death rate attributable to low fruit 
intake decreased from 113.04/100 000 to 79.80/100 000. DALYs caused by low fruit 
intake increased from 18.346 5 million in 1990 to 21.296 7 million in 2013. 
Compared with 1990, the age-standardized DALY rate attributed to low fruit 
intake decreased by 34.67%. In 2013, the top three provinces with the highest 
burden of disease attributed to low fruits intake were Tibet, Guizhou and 
Xinjiang provinces, with standardized DALY rate at 2 612.53/100 000, 2 
281.85/100 000 and 2 198.22/100 000, respectively. Compared with the results in 
1990, the standardized DALY attributed to low fruits intake decreased, 
especially in Tianjin, where decreased by 63.61%; followed by Aomen, Zhejiang, 
Shanghai and Beijing, where decreased by 59.74%, 59.53%, 56.64% and 53.88%, 
respectively. Conclusion: Compared with the situation in 1990, the burden of 
disease attributable to low fruit intake decreased in 2013, but the situation is 
still serious, especially in Tibet, Guizhou and Xinjiang provinces, where the 
burden decreased comparatively slowly.

Objective: To discuss the main causes and risk factors of disability and death 
among current Chinese adolescents. Methods: Subnational data of China from 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) was used to rank the causes and 
risk factors leading to death and disability adjusted life years (DALY) in 
Chinese adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years old, and thereby to analyze the 
main cauese and risk factors of death and DALY among Chinese adolescents in 
different genders. Results: In 2015, among Chinese adolescents aged 10-19 years 
old, the total DALY was 13 million 490 thousand years, and the total number of 
deaths was 63 258 cases. The top 3 causes of DALY were skin and subcutaneous 
diseases, iron-deficiency anemia and road injuries, resulting in DALY 
(constituent ratio) of 1 411 (10.5%), 1 094 (8.1%) and 1 029 (7.6%) thousand 
years respectively. The top 3 causes of death were road injuries, drowning and 
leukemia, causing 13 881 (21.9%), 9 895 (15.6%) and 4 620 (7.3%) deaths 
(constituent ratio) respectively. The top 3 risk factors of DALY were iron 
deficiency, alcohol use and drug use, causing 1 094 (8.1%), 487 (3.6%) and 220 
thousand years (1.6%) DALY (constituent ratio) respectively. The top 3 risk 
factors of death were alcohol use, occupational injuries and drug use, causing 5 
957 (9.4%), 1 523 (2.4%) and 810 (1.3%) deaths respectively. Conclusion: 
Unintentional injury was the top cause of DALY and death in Chinese adolescents, 
followed by skin and subcutaneous diseases and iron-deficiency anemia. Iron 
deficiency and alcohol use were the top two risk factors of DALY and death.

Objective: The objective of this study is to analyze the trend of burden of 
ischemic heart disease (IHD) in China between 1990 and 2015. Methods: Data were 
collected from the results of 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study. We arranged 
and analyzed the mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) for IHD by 
sexes, ages and provinces (excluding Taiwan, China) in China between 1990 and 
2015. The age-standardized rates were determined using the average world 
population age structure in the period of 2010-2035 as a reference, and the 
changes of the related indicators were calculated. Results: In 2015, IHD caused 
1 461 thousand deaths, and its age-standardized death rate was 114.8 per 100 
000. Number of DALYs from IHD were 25 765 thousand in 2015, with the 
age-standardized DALY rate at 1 760.2 per 100 000. From 1990 to 2015, the 
age-standardized death rate for IHD in China increased by 13.3% but 
age-standardized DALY rate decreased by 3.9%. Number of IHD DALYs among male (16 
664 thousand) was higher than it among female (9 101 thousand) in China in 2015, 
and 83.5% of total DALYs from IHD occurred among people aged over 50 years old. 
Province with highest age-standardized death rate was Heilongjiang, with rate at 
187.4 per 100 000 in 2015. Qinghai (54.0%) increased most and Macao (-52.3%) 
decreased most from 1990 to 2015. Province with highest age-standardized DALY 
rate was Xinjiang, with rate at 3 040.8 per 100 000 in 2015. Qinghai (33.2%) 
increased most while Macao (-59.0%) decreased most between 1990 and 2015. 
Conclusion: Burden of IHD in China increased remarkably from 1990 to 2015, 
especially among males and people aged over 50 years old. The differences among 
provinces were obvious.

BACKGROUND: Due to high survival rates and the relatively small benefit of 
adjuvant therapy, the application of personalized medicine (PM) through risk 
stratification is particularly beneficial in early breast cancer (BC) to avoid 
unnecessary harms from treatment. The new 21-gene assay (OncotypeDX, ODX) is a 
promising prognostic score for risk stratification that can be applied in 
conjunction with Adjuvant!Online (AO) to guide personalized chemotherapy 
decisions for early BC patients. Our goal was to evaluate risk-group specific 
cost effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for women with early stage BC in 
Austria based on AO and ODX risk stratification.
METHODS: A previously validated discrete event simulation model was applied to a 
hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women over a lifetime horizon. We simulated 
twelve risk groups derived from the joint application of ODX and AO and included 
respective additional costs. The primary outcomes of interest were life-years 
gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness (ICER). The robustness of results and decisions derived were 
tested in sensitivity analyses. A cross-country comparison of results was 
performed.
RESULTS: Chemotherapy is dominated (i.e., less effective and more costly) for 
patients with 1) low ODX risk independent of AO classification; and 2) low AO 
risk and intermediate ODX risk. For patients with an intermediate or high AO 
risk and an intermediate or high ODX risk, the ICER is below 15,000 EUR/QALY 
(potentially cost effective depending on the willingness-to-pay). Applying the 
AO risk classification alone would miss risk groups where chemotherapy is 
dominated and thus should not be considered. These results are sensitive to 
changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence but not to changes in the 
costs of chemotherapy or the ODX test.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our modeling study, chemotherapy is effective and cost 
effective for Austrian patients with an intermediate or high AO risk and an 
intermediate or high ODX risk. In other words, low ODX risk suggests 
chemotherapy should not be considered but low AO risk may benefit from 
chemotherapy if ODX risk is high. Our analysis suggests that risk-group specific 
cost-effectiveness analysis, which includes companion prognostic tests are 
essential in PM.

[Beyond Cognitive Impairment: Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Neurodegenerative 
Dementias].

[Article in Spanish]

As life expectancy increases, the number of people diagnosed with 
neurodegenerative dementia also increases. Although cognitive impairment is 
central in dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very important because 
they increase both direct and indirect costs by generating greater morbidity, 
caregiver distress, use of medication and institutionalisation. Furthermore, it 
is important to understand the nature of NPS, since they can vary across the 
different types of dementia and may provide useful clinical information 
regarding the aetiology of cognitive impairment. The first-line management of 
NPS in dementia is non-pharmacological; internal and external causes should 
first be identified and strategies developed to modify the behavioural patterns 
of the patient and their caregiver. In addition, changes in the patient's 
surroundings that may improve patient performance and behaviour should be 
encouraged. If these practices are not satisfactory, a pharmacological treatment 
approach is adopted that includes anti-dementia drugs, antipsychotics, 
antidepressants, mood stabilisers and benzodiazepines. However, psychoactive 
drugs do not offer sufficient efficacy and most of them have significant adverse 
effects, so each patient should be individually assessed, together with the 
implementation of non-pharmacological strategies, before deciding on 
pharmacological treatment for the management of NPS in dementia.

OBJECTIVE: With the prolonged life expectancy in solid organ transplant 
recipients, their quality of life and fertility desire become of particular 
concern. Pregnancy in pancreas-alone transplantation, although rare and 
complicated to manage, is not impossible anymore. We here report such a case 
with literature review to address this issue.
CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old, primigravida patient with underlying stage 4 chronic 
renal insufficiency and type 1 diabetes mellitus post pancreas-alone 
transplantation 5 years prior to her initial visit consulted our service. 
Antepartum care with intensive monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and 
tacrolimus serum concentration were given. Successful maternal and fetal 
outcomes are presented here.
CONCLUSION: Child-bearing in solid organ transplantation recipients has become 
more promising nowadays, even for a difficult case of pancreas-alone transplant 
recipient complicated with chronic renal insufficiency and superimposed 
pre-eclampsia. Thorough antepartum counseling and cautious monitoring of 
maternal, fetal and graft conditions by multidisciplinary specialties are key to 
favorable pregnancy outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rates in younger women 
with unilateral breast cancer have more than doubled. Studies of cost and 
quality of life of the procedure remain inconclusive.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-tree model in TreeAge 
Pro 2015 was used to compare long-term costs and quality of life following 
unilateral mastectomy (UM) with routine surveillance versus CPM for sporadic 
breast cancer in women aged 45 years. A 10-year risk period for contralateral 
breast cancer (CBC), reconstruction, wound complications, cost of routine 
surveillance, and treatment for CBC were used to estimate accrued costs. In 
addition, a societal perspective was used to estimate quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) following either treatment for a period of 30 years. Medical costs 
were obtained from the 2014 Medicare physician fee schedule and event 
probabilities were taken from recent literature.
RESULTS: The mean cost of UM with surveillance was $14,141 and CPM was $20,319. 
Treatment with CPM resulted in $6178 more in costs but equivalent QALYs (17.93) 
compared with UM over 30 years of follow-up. Even with worst-case scenario and 
varying assumptions, CPM is dominated by UM in terms of cost and quality.
CONCLUSIONS: From this refined model, UM with routine surveillance costs less 
and provides an equivalent quality of life. Patients undergoing CPM may 
eliminate the anxiety of routine surveillance, but they face the burden of 
higher lifetime medical costs.

BRAF V600E mutations occur frequently in malignant melanoma, but are rare in 
most malignant glioma subtypes. Besides, more benign brain tumors such as 
ganglioglioma, dysembryoblastic neuroepithelial tumours and supratentorial 
pilocytic astrocytomas, only pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (50-78%) and 
epitheloid glioblastoma (50%) regularly exhibit BRAF mutations. In the present 
study, we report on three patients with recurrent malignant gliomas harbouring a 
BRAF V600E mutation. All patients presented with markedly disseminated 
leptomeningeal disease at recurrence and had progressed after radiotherapy and 
alkylating chemotherapy. Therefore, estimated life expectancy at recurrence was 
a few weeks. All three patients received dabrafenib as a single agent and all 
showed a complete or nearly complete response. Treatment is ongoing and patients 
are stable for 27 months, 7 months and 3 months, respectively. One patient 
showed a dramatic radiologic and clinical response after one week of treatment. 
We were able to generate an ex vivo tumor cell culture from CSF in one patient. 
Treatment of this cell culture with dabrafenib resulted in reduced cell density 
and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in vitro. To date, this is the first 
series on adult patients with BRAF-mutated malignant glioma and leptomeningeal 
dissemination treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. All patients showed a 
dramatic response with one patient showing an ongoing response for more than two 
years.
