Purpose The primary aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients aged 25 years and under by calculating 
the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 10 years 
post-operatively, and over the course of a lifetime. Secondary aims were to 
describe the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), Oxford hip score 
(OHS), and satisfaction in these patients. Methods From 2000 to 2016, 33 
patients undergoing THA aged 25 and under had pre-operative and one-year 
post-operative EuroQol five-dimensions (EQ-5D) scores and OHS recorded 
prospectively. Post-operative change in EQ-5D allowed calculation of a 
health-utility score, which, when combined with life expectancy, gave total 
QALYs gained. Results The mean age was 20 years (range 13.3-24.9), with 23 
females (72.7%). Mean number of QALYs gained was 21.1 (95% CI 14.1-28.2). Total 
lifetime cost per patient was £14641, giving a mean cost per QALY of £4183 at 10 
years post-operatively, and £694 over the total remaining lifetime. Discounting 
total QALYs gained at a rate of 3.5% and 5% per remaining year of life 
expectancy increased the mean cost per QALY to £1652 and £2187, respectively. 
Mean pre- and post-operative EQ-5D index were 0.27 (SD 0.27) and 0.63 (SD 0.29), 
respectively (p=0.0001). Mean pre-operative and post-operative OHS was 37.5 (SD 
7.9) and 19.7 (SD 6.94), respectively (p<0.00001). Conclusion THA remains a 
cost-effective intervention for patients aged 25 years and under. It is also 
associated with significant improvement in HRQoL, OHS, and high levels of 
patient satisfaction in this unique patient group.

The importance of human wellbeing is documented in the literature of development 
economics because of its intensifying impacts on economic growth and 
productivity of labor in the long-run. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no 
empirical study has examined the symmetric association between China's financial 
institutional development, education, and health outcomes. Thus, our study aims 
to fill this vacuum by employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) 
approach to explore the impact of financial institutional development and 
education on life expectancy and infant mortality rate from 1990 to 2020. The 
empirical analysis reveals that financial institutional development and 
education report a significant increase in life expectancy and meaningful 
reduction in mortality rate in the long-run. Based on these findings, the study 
may deliver intuitive policy implications regarding improvement in health 
conditions that are imperative for promoting economic growth in the long-run.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity has an effect on life expectancy, while its effect on 
healthy life years is unclear. This study aims to investigate the associations 
between healthy life years lost due to multimorbidity and living risk.
METHODS: The participants of The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 
(CHARLS) were assessed at four visits between 2011 (baseline) and 2018. At 
baseline, 13,949 individuals were administered surveys. A combined score based 
on seven health-related factors was calculated, and the participants were 
classified into 3 groups based on living risk. We used the adjusted Cox 
regression methods to examine the associations between living risk groups and 
multimorbidity. We estimated the healthy life years lost due to multimorbidity 
using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: A total of 9,091 adults aged 45 years or older (mean age of 59.55 ± 
9.50 years with one disease, 52.60% women) were analyzed in the CHARLS. The 
probability of no multimorbidity over 7 years decreased from 0.9947 to 0.9697 in 
the low-risk group, whereas the probability of multimorbidity in low living risk 
was lower than that of high living risk, ranging from HR 1.253 (95% 
CI.992-1.581; P = 0.058) to 1.431 (1.05-1.949; P = 0.023) in sex, and ranging 
from HR 1.340 (95% CI 1.106-1.623; P = 0.003) to 2.002 (1.058-3.787; P = 0.033) 
in area. At 45 years, the healthy life years lost in men was <0.27 years 
compared to women in the low-risk group. Hypertension increased the risk of 
multimorbidity with an HR of 1.5 (95% CI 1.21-1.91; P < 0.001) in men. In urban 
areas, participants with diabetes had 3.2 times (95% CI 1.75-5.94, P < 0.001) 
higher risk of multimorbidity than participants without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a low-risk lifestyle could decrease 
the loss of healthy life years under multimorbidity. The probability of 
multimorbidity in women and in urban areas was high. Hypertension was correlated 
with the hazard risk of multimorbidity.

Less is More: Deprescribing Medications in Older Adults with Kidney Disease: A 
Review.

Due to age and impaired kidney function, older adults with kidney disease are at 
increased risk of medication-related problems and related hospitalizations. One 
proa ctive approach to minimize this risk is deprescribing. Deprescribing refers 
to the systematic process of reducing or stopping a medication. Aside from 
preventing harm, deprescribing can potentially optimize patients' quality of 
life by aligning medications with their goals of care. For some patients, 
deprescribing could involve less aggressive management of their diabetes and/or 
hypertension. In other instances, deprescribing targets may include potentially 
inappropriate medications that carry greater risk of harm than benefit in older 
adults, medications that have questionable efficacy, including medications that 
have varying efficacy by degree of kidney function, and that increase medication 
regimen complexity. We include a guide for clinicians to utilize in 
deprescribing, the List, Evaluate, Shared Decision-Making, Support (LESS) 
framework. The LESS framework provides key considerations at each step of the 
deprescribing process that can be tailored for the medications and context of 
individu al patients. Patient characteristics or clinical events that warrant 
consideration of deprescribing include limited life expectancy, cognitive 
impairment, and health status changes, such as dialysis initiation or recent 
hospitalization. We acknowledge patient-, clinician-, and system-level 
challenges to the depre scribing process. These include patient hesitancy and 
challenges to discussing goals of care, clinician time constraints and a lack of 
evidence-based guidelines, and system-level challenges of interoperable 
electronic health records and limited incentives for deprescribing. However, 
novel evidence-based tools designed to facilitate deprescribing and future 
evidence on effectiveness of deprescribing could help mitigate these barriers. 
This review provides foundational knowledge on deprescribing as an emerging 
component of clinical practice and research within nephrology.

This paper explores the ethical dimension of the opportunity to offer improved 
electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) systems addressing personal needs of 
pediatric cancer patients, their parents and caregivers, with regard to 
technological advance of digital health. This opportunity has been explored in 
the MyPal research project, which aims to assess a patient-centered service for 
palliative care relying on the adaptation and extension of digital health tools 
and concepts available from previous projects. Development and implementation of 
ePROs need to take place in a safe, secure and responsible manner, preventing 
any possible harm and safeguarding the integrity of humans. To that end, 
although the final results will be published at the end of the project, this 
paper aims to increase awareness of the ethical ramifications we had to address 
in the design and testing of new technologies and to show the essentiality of 
protection and promotion of privacy, safety and ethical standards. We have thus 
reached a final design complying with the following principles: (a) respect for 
the autonomy of participants, especially children, (b) data protection and 
transparency, (c) fairness and non-discrimination, (d) individual wellbeing of 
participants in relation to their physical and psychological health status and 
e) accessibility and acceptability of digital health technologies for better 
user-engagement. These principles are adapted from the Ethics Guidelines for a 
trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) which provide the framework for similar 
interventions to be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations, 
ethical, ensuring compliance to ethical principles and values and robust, both 
from a technical and social perspective.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an accurate, usable prediction model for 
other-cause mortality (OCM) in patients with prostate cancer diagnosed in the 
United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Model training was performed using the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010 including men aged >40 years with 
follow-up to the year 2014. The model was validated in the Prostate, Lung, 
Colon, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial prostate cancer cohort, which enrolled 
patients between 1993 and 2001 with follow-up to the year 2015. Time-dependent 
area under the curve (AUC) and calibration were assessed in the validation 
cohort. Analyses were performed to assess algorithmic bias.
RESULTS: The 2420 patient training cohort had 459 deaths over a median follow-up 
of 8.8 years among survivors. The final model included eight predictors: age; 
education; marital status; diabetes; hypertension; stroke; body mass index; and 
smoking. It had an AUC of 0.75 at 10 years for predicting OCM in the validation 
cohort of 8220 patients. The final model significantly outperformed the Social 
Security Administration life tables and showed adequate predictive performance 
across race, educational attainment, and marital status subgroups. There is 
evidence of major variability in life expectancy that is not captured by age, 
with life expectancy predictions differing by 10 or more years among patients of 
the same age.
CONCLUSION: Using two national cohorts, we have developed and validated a simple 
and useful prediction model for OCM for patients with prostate cancer treated in 
the United States, which will allow for more personalized treatment in 
accordance with guidelines.

Triage in Times of COVID-19: A Moral Dilemma.

Tutić A(1), Krumpal I(1), Haiser F(1).

(1)University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

We present evidence from choice experiments on hypothetical triage decisions in 
a pandemic. Respondents have to decide who out of two patients gets ventilation. 
Patients are described in terms of attributes such as short-term survival 
chance, long-term life expectancy, and their current ventilation status. 
Attributes are derived from the ethical discourse among experts regarding triage 
guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic and differ in the extent to which they 
are salient from a utilitarian or deontological perspective. Empirically, we 
find that although nonexperts agree with experts in prioritizing utilitarian 
attributes in triage decisions, nonexperts also consider the adherence to the 
norm of wearing face masks as particularly relevant. Furthermore, our study 
supports Greene and colleagues' dual-process model of moral judgment; we find 
that utilitarian attributes are more decisive for respondents with a greater 
inclination toward utilitarianism and for respondents with a greater tendency 
toward reflection.

AIM: We conducted a model-based economic analysis of sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors 
(DPP4is) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with and without established 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), using 10-year real-world data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was utilized to estimate healthcare costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a 10-year simulation time horizon 
from a healthcare sector perspective, with both costs and QALYs discounted at 3% 
annually. Model inputs were derived from analyses of Taiwan's National Health 
Insurance Research Database or published studies of Taiwanese populations. The 
primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). 
Incorporated with our study findings, a targeted literature review was conducted 
to synthesize updated evidence on the cost-effectiveness of SGLT2is versus 
DPP4is.
RESULTS: Over 10 years, use of SGLT2is versus DPP4is yielded ICERs of $3244 and 
$4186 per QALY gained for patients with T2D, with and without established CVDs, 
respectively. Results were robust across a series of sensitivity and scenario 
analyses, showing ICERs between $-1074 (cost-saving) and $8467 per QALY gained 
for patients with T2D with established CVDs and between $369 and $37 122 per 
QALY gained for patients with T2D without established CVDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of SGLT2is versus DPP4is was highly cost-effective for patients 
with T2D regardless of their CVD history in real-world clinical practice. Our 
results extend current evidence by showing SGLT2is as an economically rational 
alternative over DPP4is for T2D treatment in routine care. Future research is 
warranted to explore the heterogeneous economic benefits of SGLT2is given 
diverse patient characteristics in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Mortality burden in South Africa since the mid-1990s has been 
characterized by a quadruple disease burden: HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB); 
other communicable diseases (excluding HIV/AIDS and TB), maternal causes, 
perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies; non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs); and injuries. Causes from these broad groupings have persistently 
constituted the top 10 causes of death. However, proportions and rankings have 
varied over time, alongside overall mortality levels.
OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence on the contributions of age and cause-of-death to 
changes in mortality levels in a rural South African population over a quarter 
century (1993-2018).
METHODS: Using mortality and cause-of-death data from the Agincourt Health and 
Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), we derive estimates of the 
distribution of deaths by cause, and hazards of death by age, sex, and time 
period, 1993-2018. We derive estimates of life expectancies at birth and years 
of life expectancy gained at age 15 if most common causes of death were deleted. 
We compare mortality indicators and cause-of-death trends from the Agincourt 
HDSS with South African national indicators generated from publicly available 
datasets.
RESULTS: Mortality and cause-of-death transition reveals that overall mortality 
levels have returned to pre-HIV epidemic levels. In recent years, the 
concentration of mortality has shifted towards older ages, and the mortality 
burden from cardiovascular diseases and other chronic NCDs are more prominent as 
people living with HIV/AIDS access ART and live longer. Changes in life 
expectancy at birth, distribution of deaths by age, and major cause-of-death 
categories in the Agincourt population follow a similar pattern to the South 
African population.
CONCLUSION: The Agincourt HDSS provides critical information about general 
mortality, cause-of-death, and age patterns in rural South Africa. Realigning 
and strengthening the South African public health and healthcare systems is 
needed to concurrently cater for the prevention, control, and treatment of 
multiple disease conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in quality of life (QoL) after an eight-week 
period of robotic exoskeleton training in a homogeneous group of patients with 
chronic complete spinal cord injury (SCI).
DESIGN: Prospective single-group pre-post study.
SETTING: Rehabilitation center.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a chronic (>6 months) motor complete SCI (T1-L1).
INTERVENTION: Twenty-four training sessions with the ReWalk exoskeleton over an 
eight-week period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: QoL, assessed with the sum score of the Short Form-36 with 
Walk Wheel modification (SF-36ww). Secondary outcome measures were the eight 
SF-36ww subdomains, satisfaction with bladder and bowel management, lower 
extremity joint passive range of motion (pROM), and lower extremity spasticity.
RESULTS: Twenty-one participants completed the training. QoL significantly 
improved after the training period (average SF-36 sum score 621 ± 90) compared 
to baseline (571 ± 133) (t(20)=-2.5, P=.02). Improvements were seen on the 
SF-36ww subdomains for pain (P=.003), social functioning (P=.03), mental health 
(P=.02), and general health perception (P=.01). Satisfaction with bladder 
management (range 1-5) improved from median 3 at baseline to 4 after exoskeleton 
training (P=0.01). No changes in satisfaction with bowel management (P=.11), 
pROM (hip-extension (P=.49), knee-extension (P=.36), ankle dorsiflexion 
(P=.69)), or spasticity (P=.94) were found.
CONCLUSION: Even in patients with chronic motor complete SCI and a relatively 
high level of QoL at baseline, a short-term exoskeleton training improved their 
QoL, pain and satisfaction with bladder management; findings that warrant 
further controlled studies in this specific SCI population.

OBJECTIVES: To explore mortality and causes of death among Norwegian patients 
with RA, PsA and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) compared with the general 
population by conducting a nationwide registry-based cohort study.
METHODS: Patients with RA, PsA and axSpA were identified from the Norwegian 
Patient Registry based on ICD-10 codes between 2008 and 2017. Using age as the 
time variable, all-cause and cause-specific mortality were estimated between 
2010 and 2017 with the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the cumulative incidence 
competing risk method, respectively. Sex-, education level-, health region- and 
age group-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were estimated using Cox 
regression models.
RESULTS: We identified 36 095 RA, 18 700 PsA and 16 524 axSpA patients (70%, 53% 
and 45% women, respectively). RA and axSpA were associated with increased 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.45 [95% CI: 1.41, 1.48] and HR 1.38 [95% CI: 1.28, 
1.38], respectively). Women but not men with PsA had a slightly increased 
mortality rate (HR 1.10 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.21] among women and 1.02 [95% CI: 0.93, 
1.11] among men). For all patient groups as well as for the general population, 
the three leading causes of death were cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and 
respiratory diseases. RA patients had increased mortality from all of these 
causes, while axSpA patients had increased mortality from cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSION: Even in the era of modern treatments for IJDs, patients with RA and 
axSpA still have shortened life expectancy. Our findings warrant further 
attention to the prevention and management of comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Palmoplantar pustulosis is a rare, debilitating, chronic skin 
disease involving the hands and feet, and there are limited treatment options. 
Mechanistic findings suggest that interleukin 1 may be a pathogenic driver.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not anakinra [Sobi (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum 
AB), Stockholm, Sweden], an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, delivers 
therapeutic benefit in palmoplantar pustulosis.
DESIGN: A Phase IV, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two 
stages and an adaptive element (24 participants in stage 1, 64 participants in 
total) with an open-label extension.
SETTING: Sixteen hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of palmoplantar 
pustulosis and a disease duration of > 6 months and of sufficient impact and 
severity to require systemic therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised (1 : 1) to daily self-administered 
subcutaneous injection of either anakinra or a placebo for 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area 
and Severity Index score measured at 0, 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, with the primary 
end point at 8 weeks adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes included other 
investigator-assessed efficacy measures of disease severity, safety measures and 
participant-reported measures of efficacy and impact.
RESULTS: A total of 64 participants (mean baseline Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area 
and Severity Index score of 17.8, standard deviation 10.5) received anakinra 
(n = 31) or the placebo (n = 33). In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, 
which estimated the effect of the treatment policy, the mean treatment group 
difference at 8 weeks after adjustment for baseline Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area 
and Severity Index score was –1.65 (95% confidence interval –4.77 to 1.47; 
p = 0.300), in favour of anakinra relative to placebo, but was not statistically 
significant. Similarly, secondary investigator-assessed outcomes did not show 
statistical superiority of anakinra: the baseline-adjusted mean difference in 
fresh pustule count (palms and soles) between the anakinra group and the placebo 
group was 2.94 (95% confidence interval –26.44 to 32.33), in favour of placebo, 
and the mean difference in total pustule count was –30.08 (95% confidence 
interval –83.20 to 23.05), in favour of anakinra. Participant-assessed outcomes 
were consistent with these objective findings: the baseline-adjusted mean 
difference in Dermatology Life Quality Index between the anakinra group and the 
placebo group was 0.52 (95% confidence interval –2.04 to 3.07), in favour of 
placebo, and the mean difference in Palmoplantar Quality-of-Life Index was 1.27 
(95% confidence interval –3.04 to 5.57), in favour of placebo. However, the 
proportion of participants who strongly agreed that treatment was worthwhile was 
greater in the anakinra group (12/29, 41%) than in the placebo group (4/28, 
14%), a difference in proportion of 27% (95% confidence interval 5% to 49%). In 
the complier-average causal effect analysis, the baseline-adjusted mean 
treatment group difference in the week 8 Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and 
Severity Index score in individuals who received ≥ 50% of injections was –2.30 
(95% confidence interval –6.54 to 1.93; p = 0.287) and in those who received 
≥ 90% of injections was –3.80 (95% confidence interval –10.76 to 3.16; 
p = 0.285), in favour of anakinra. No serious infections, significant 
neutropenia or other serious adverse events occurred. Injection site reactions 
were more frequent for those receiving anakinra (19/31, 61%) than for those 
receiving placebo (1/33, 3%).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that anakinra was superior to placebo. For 
the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis, interleukin 1 blockade is not a useful 
intervention.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size was calculated to detect a large effect size. 
Treatment adherence was lower than expected. It cannot be ruled out that there 
was some selection bias towards less severe or unstable participants entering 
the trial given that the trial was placebo controlled with a required washout 
period.
FUTURE WORK: Palmoplantar pustulosis remains an area of high unmet need and 
further research is recommended to (1) identify new drug targets, (2) determine 
the contributory role of drug exposure (including pharmacokinetics and 
adherence) and (3) validate outcome measures in palmoplantar pustulosis.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISCRTN13127147 and EudraCT 
2015-003600-23.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) 
programme, a MRC and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) partnership. 
This will be published in full in Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation; Vol. 9, No. 
2. See the NIHR Journals Library for further project information.

Daily injections of anakinra did not show change in disease activity compared 
with placebo when assessed by the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity 
Index at 8 weeks.

PURPOSE: Men with prostate cancer prefer patient-specific, quantitative 
assessments of longevity in shared decision making. We sought to characterize 
how physicians communicate the 3 components of competing risks-life expectancy 
(LE), cancer prognosis and treatment-related survival benefit-in treatment 
consultations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conversation related to LE, cancer prognosis and 
treatment-related survival benefit was identified in transcripts from treatment 
consultations of 42 men with low- and intermediate-risk disease across 10 
multidisciplinary providers. Consensus of qualitative coding by multiple 
reviewers noted the most detailed mode of communication used to describe each 
throughout the consultation.
RESULTS: Physicians frequently failed to provide patient-specific, quantitative 
estimates of LE and cancer mortality. LE was omitted in 17% of consultations, 
expressed as a generalization (eg "long"/"short") in 17%, rough number of years 
in 31%, probability of mortality/survival at an arbitrary timepoint in 17% and 
in only 19% as a specific number of years. Cancer mortality was omitted in 24% 
of consultations, expressed as a generalization in 7%, years of expected life in 
2%, probability at no/arbitrary timepoint in 40% and in only 26% as the 
probability at LE. Treatment-related survival benefit was often omitted; cancer 
mortality was reported without treatment in 38%, with treatment in 10% and in 
only 29% both with and without treatment. Physicians achieved "trifecta"-1) 
quantifying probability of cancer mortality 2) with and without treatment 3) at 
the patient's LE-in only 14% of consultations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often fail to adequately quantify competing risks. We 
recommend the "trifecta" approach, reporting 1) probability of cancer mortality 
2) with and without treatment 3) at the patient's LE.

BACKGROUND: Evidence for parenting programs to improve wellbeing in children 
under three is inconclusive. We investigated the fidelity, impact, and 
cost-effectiveness of two parenting programs delivered within a longitudinal 
proportionate delivery model ('E-SEE Steps').
METHODS: Eligible parents with a child ≤ 8 weeks were recruited into a parallel 
two-arm, assessor blinded, randomized controlled, community-based, trial with 
embedded economic and process evaluations. Post-baseline randomization applied a 
5:1 (intervention-to-control) ratio, stratified by primary (child 
social-emotional wellbeing (ASQ:SE-2)) and key secondary (maternal depression 
(PHQ-9)) outcome scores, sex, and site. All intervention parents received the 
Incredible Years® Baby Book (IY-B), and were offered the targeted Infant 
(IY-I)/Toddler (IY-T) program if eligible, based on ASQ:SE-2/PHQ-9 scores. 
Control families received usual services. Fidelity data were analysed 
descriptively. Primary analysis applied intention to treat. Effectiveness 
analysis fitted a marginal model to outcome scores. Cost-effectiveness analysis 
involved Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The target sample (N = 606) was not achieved; 341 mothers were 
randomized (285:56), 322 (94%) were retained to study end. Of those eligible for 
the IY-I (n = 101), and IY-T (n = 101) programs, 51 and 21 respectively, 
attended. Eight (of 14) groups met the 80% self-reported fidelity criteria. No 
significant differences between arms were found for adjusted mean difference 
scores; ASQ:SE-2 (3.02, 95% CI: -0.03, 6.08, p = 0.052), PHQ-9 (-0.61; 95% CI: 
-1.34, 0.12, p = 0.1). E-SEE Steps had higher costs, but improved mothers' 
Health-related Quality of Life (0.031 Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain), 
ICER of £20,062 per QALY compared to control. Serious adverse events (n = 86) 
were unrelated to the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: E-SEE Steps was not effective, but was borderline cost-effective. 
The model was delivered with varying fidelity, with lower-than-expected IY-T 
uptake. Changes to delivery systems and the individual programs may be needed 
prior to future evaluation.

Beekeepers regularly employ management practices to mitigate losses during the 
winter, often considered the most difficult time during a colony life cycle. 
Management recommendations involving covering or wrapping hives in insulation 
during winter have a long history; over 100 years ago, most recommendations for 
overwintering in cold climates involved heavy insulation wraps or moving hives 
indoors. These recommendations began to change in the mid-20th century, but hive 
covers are still considered useful and are described in contemporary beekeeping 
manuals and cooperative extension materials. However, most of the data 
supporting their use is published primarily in non-peer reviewed trade journals 
and was collected >40 years ago. In this time, the beekeeping environment has 
changed substantially, with new pressures from pathogens, agrochemicals, and 
land use changes. Here, we provide an update to the historical literature, 
reporting a randomized experiment testing the effectiveness of a common honey 
bee hive cover system across eight apiaries in central Illinois, USA, a 
temperate region dominated by conventional annual agriculture. We found that, 
when other recommended overwintering preparations are performed, covered 
colonies consumed less food stores and survived better than uncovered controls 
(22.5% higher survival). This study highlights the value of hive covers, even in 
an area not subject to extremely cold winter conditions, and these data can aid 
the production of evidence-based extension recommendations for beekeepers.

AIM: Education level has been long considered a life-quality modifier, but 
little is known about its relation to life expectancy in patients with 
cardiovascular disease. This study aims to assess possible correlations between 
education level and survival in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from a randomised trial of 
1082 hospitalised patients with AF (mean age of 75 ± 11 years) who were followed 
up after discharge. Patients were divided into three groups based on their 
education level: i) none or primary (NPEL), ii) secondary (SEL), and iii) 
tertiary education level (TEL). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable-adjusted 
hazard ratios (aHRs) were used to compare survival rates between groups. The 
primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The composite secondary outcome was 
cardiovascular mortality or any hospitalisation.
RESULTS: After a median 31-month follow-up period, 289 (41.9%) patients died in 
the NPEL group, 75 (31.1%) in the SEL group, and 29 (19.1%) in the TEL group. 
The aHRs for all-cause mortality were 0.42 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66; p < 0.001) for 
the TEL group compared with the NPEL group, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93; 
p = 0.02) for the TEL group compared with the SEL group, and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 
to 0.93; p = 0.01) for the SEL group compared with the NPEL group. The 
corresponding aHRs for the composite secondary outcome were 0.36 (95% CI, 0.23 
to 0.52; p < 0.001), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.80; p < 0.001), and 0.67 (95% CI, 
0.50 to 9.91; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Higher education levels were independently associated with fewer 
fatal and non-fatal outcomes in recently hospitalised patients with AF.
