CONCLUSION: After adjusting for various other factors, our findings showed a 
lower life expectancy among sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. Efforts 
are required to make sexual minorities believe in a high life expectancy (e.g., 
increased optimism or reduced perceived discrimination) - which in turn can help 
to increase their actual longevity and successful ageing. Future research is 
required to explore underlying mechanisms (such as expected stigma in later 
life).

BACKGROUND: Low physical activity (LPA) is linked to the risk of stroke, but the 
disease burden of stroke attributable to LPA needs to be understood to develop 
effective preventive strategies. We aim to assess spatiotemporal trends in the 
global burden of stroke attributable to LPA from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study, our research examined deaths, the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), 
the Age-Standardized Mortality Rate (ASMR), the Age-Standardized DALY Rate 
(ASDR), and the Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) for stroke 
attributable to LPA.
RESULTS: Deaths and DALYs were on the rise worldwide from 1990 to 2019, with 
increases of 72.72% for the former and 67.41% for the latter; ASMR and ASDR 
decreased, with the ASMR-related EAPC of -1.61 (95% CI:-1.71--1.5) and 
ASDR-related EAPC of -1.35 (95% CI:-1.43--1.27); females had more numbers of 
deaths and DALYs, and the majorities of deaths and DALYs were shared by those 
aged ≥ 70. The highest burden rates were shared by North Africa, the Middle 
East, and Tropical Latin America; the ASMR-related EAPC was associated with the 
ASMR in 1990 (R = -0.26, P < 0.001) and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) across 
different countries in 2019 (R = -0.61, P < 0.001), respectively, and such 
patterns were similar to what ASDR and the ASDR-related EAPC had; the Human 
Development Index (HDI) in 2019 was associated with the ASMR-related EAPC 
(R = 0.63, P < 0.001) and the ASDR-related EAPC across different countries 
(R = -0.62, P < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, deaths and DALYs of stroke attributable to LPA were on 
the rise, although their age-standardized rates presented downward over the past 
three decades; the burden of stroke attributable to LPA showed upward trends 
especially in those aged ≥ 70 and females in the regions of East Asia, North 
Africa, and the Middle East, which need more attention to the effects of 
physical activity on health interventions.

The highdose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVHD) has shown improved 
protection against influenza and its complications in older adults. We aimed to 
evaluate the costeffectiveness of QIVHD compared with QIVSD among Korean adults 
aged ≥ 65 years in reducing influenzarelated disease burden. We evaluated the 
2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons and their average values using a static decision 
tree model. The difference in efficacy between standard-dose (SD) and high-dose 
(HD) was calculated based on the results of a clinical trial comparing Fluzone® 
High-Dose Vaccine and Fluzone® Vaccine in older adults. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were assessed from the healthcare system 
perspective. A discount rate of 4.5% was applied to life-year-gained (LYG) 
values and utilities. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses to account for both epidemiological and economic sources of 
uncertainty. In the analysis of the 2017/2018 season, the QIV-HD strategy 
generated an excess of 0.00182 life-years (Lys)/person and 0.003953 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)/person compared with QIV-SD. The ICER was 
6,467.56 United States Dollars (USD)/QALY. In the analysis from the 2016/2017 
season, QIV-HD caused a surplus of 0.00117 Lys/person and 0.003272 QALYs/person 
compared with QIV-SD. ICER was 7,902.46 USD /QALY. From the average data of the 
2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons, an excess of 0.00147 Lys/person and 0.003561 
QALYs/person were generated using QIV-HD compared with QIV-SD, while the ICER 
was 7,190.44 USD /QALY. From the healthcare system perspective, QIV-HD was a 
more cost-effective vaccination option in reducing influenza-related disease 
burden and healthcare costs in Koreans aged ≥ 65 years compared with QIV-SD.

Microbial mutualists can profoundly modify host species ecology and evolution, 
by extension altering interactions with other microbial species, including 
pathogens. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may moderate infections by 
pathogens, but the direction and strength of these effects can be idiosyncratic. 
To assess how the introduction of AMF impacts the incidence and severity of 
aboveground plant diseases (i.e. 'disease impact'), we conducted a meta-analysis 
of 130 comparisons derived from 69 published studies. To elucidate the potential 
mechanisms underlying the influence of AMF on pathogens, we conducted three 
glasshouse experiments involving six non-woody plant species, yielded crucial 
data on leaf nutrient composition, plant defense compounds, and transcriptomes. 
Our meta-analysis revealed that the inoculation of AMF lead to a reduction in 
disease impact. More precisely, AMF inoculation was associated with a decrease 
in necrotrophic diseases, while no significant impact on biotrophic diseases. 
Chemical and transcriptome analyses suggested that these effects may be driven 
by AMF regulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathways in 
glasshouse experiments. However, changes in plant nutritional status and 
secondary chemicals may also regulate disease impact. These results emphasize 
the importance of incorporating pathogen life history when predicting how 
microbial mutualisms affect disease impact.

literature review.

BACKGROUND: Leukodystrophies are hereditary white matter diseases characterized 
by genetic polymorphisms and considerable phenotypic variability. They can be 
classified into myelin and non-myelin malformations. These diseases are rare, 
affecting 1 out of 250,000-500,000 individuals and can manifest at any age. A 
subtype of leukodystrophy, associated with missense mutations in the RNA 
polymerase subunit III (POLR3A) gene, is inherited in an autosomal recessive 
manner.
CASE REPORT: We report and analyse a case of a 34-year-old female who presented 
with ataxia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed 
demyelinating lesions in the white matter. Genetic testing identified the 
c.4044C > G and c.1186-2A > G variants in the POLR3A gene. The patient was 
diagnosed with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 7 and received neurotrophic 
and symptomatic supportive therapy. However, after 1 month of follow-up, there 
was no improvement in her symptoms.
CONCLUSION: POLR3A-induced leukodystrophy is relatively rare and not well 
understood, making it challenging to diagnose and easy to overlook. The 
prognosis for this disease is generally poor, significantly impacting the 
quality of life of affected individuals. Currently, no cure is available for 
this condition, and treatment is limited to managing symptoms. Further research 
into new treatment methods for POLR3A-induced leukodystrophy is imperative to 
improve the quality of life and potentially extend the life expectancy of 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality. There is 
increasing research examining life expectancy and years-of-potential-life-lost 
(YPLL) to quantify the disease impact on survival in people with mental 
disorders. We aimed to systematically synthesize studies to estimate life 
expectancy and YPLL in people with any and specific mental disorders across a 
broad spectrum of diagnoses.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, 
MEDLINE, PsychINFO, WOS from inception to July 31, 2023, for published studies 
reporting life expectancy and/or YPLL for mental disorders. Criteria for study 
inclusion were: patients of all ages with any mental disorders; reported data on 
life expectancy and/or YPLL of a mental-disorder cohort relative to the general 
population or a comparison group without mental disorders; and cohort studies. 
We excluded non-cohort studies, publications containing non-peer-reviewed data 
or those restricted to population subgroups. Survival estimates, i.e., life 
expectancy and YPLL, were pooled (based on summary data extracted from the 
included studies) using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and 
random-effects meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of 
heterogeneity. Risk-of-bias assessment was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022321190).
FINDINGS: Of 35,865 studies identified in our research, 109 studies from 24 
countries or regions including 12,171,909 patients with mental disorders were 
eligible for analysis (54 for life expectancy and 109 for YPLL). Pooled life 
expectancy for mental disorders was 63.85 years (95% CI 62.63-65.06; 
I2 = 100.0%), and pooled YPLL was 14.66 years (95% CI 13.88-15.98; I2 = 100.0%). 
Disorder-stratified analyses revealed that substance-use disorders had the 
shortest life expectancy (57.07 years [95% CI 54.47-59.67]), while neurotic 
disorders had the longest lifespan (69.51 years [95% CI 67.26-71.76]). 
Substance-use disorders exhibited the greatest YPLL (20.38 years [95% CI 
18.65-22.11]), followed by eating disorders (16.64 years [95% CI 7.45-25.82]), 
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (15.37 years [95% CI 14.18-16.55]), and 
personality disorders (15.35 years [95% CI 12.80-17.89]). YPLLs attributable to 
natural and unnatural deaths in mental disorders were 4.38 years (95% CI 
3.15-5.61) and 8.11 years (95% CI 6.10-10.13; suicide: 8.31 years [95% CI 
6.43-10.19]), respectively. Stratified analyses by study period suggested that 
the longevity gap persisted over time. Significant cross-study heterogeneity was 
observed.
INTERPRETATION: Mental disorders are associated with substantially reduced life 
expectancy, which is transdiagnostic in nature, encompassing a wide range of 
diagnoses. Implementation of comprehensive and multilevel intervention 
approaches is urgently needed to rectify lifespan inequalities for people with 
mental disorders.
FUNDING: None.

Propensity Score-Matched Analysis of Minimal Invasive Surgery versus Open 
Surgery for Colorectal Cancer in Older Patients.

Minciuna CE, Gavrila D, Alexa C, Vasile A, Tudor S, Purnichescu-Purtan R, 
Dragomir MP, Lacatus M, Prada GI, Vasilescu C.

Introduction: Currently, surgeons deal with an older patient cohort, confronting 
new challenges brought by the raised life expectancy. This population is 
unrepresented in surgical trials; therefore, the optimal therapy is still a 
matter of debate. The efficacy of open versus minimal invasive management of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) in an elderly cohort is not clearly established. The 
current study assesses the minimal invasive approach in elderly patients 
undergoing colorectal surgery. Material and Methods: The General Surgery 
Department database was inquired between 2012 and 2015 using the following 
filters: age Ã¢?Â¥ 65 and rectal or colon adenocarcinoma. After applying the 
exclusion criteria, 975 cases were obtained: 842 underwent open surgery (OS) and 
133 underwent minimal invasive surgery (MIS). A propensity score matching was 
performed to reduce patient selection bias. Results: After the propensity score 
matching, the MIS group had a shorter postoperative hospital stay than the OS 
group (p = 0.025). From the preoperative variables, the presence of chronic lung 
disease was significantly higher in the OS group (p = 0.039). The presence of 
chronic lung disease positively associates with the Clavien-Dindo classification 
(p 0.001) and with the number of days from surgery to discharge (p = 0.028). 
Conclusion: The chronological age alone should not be a limit to MIS granting 
that it showed no inferiority to the OS in terms of postoperative morbidity, 
correlating with lower postoperative stay in the elderly. Further prospective 
studies are needed to assess the outcome of MIS in elderly population.

Drawing cohort profiles and cohort forecasts from grids of age-period data is 
common practice in demography. In this research note, we (1) show how 
demographic measures artificially fluctuate when calculated from the diagonals 
of age-period rates because of timing and cohort-size bias, (2) estimate the 
magnitude of these biases, and (3) illustrate how prediction intervals for 
cohort indicators of mortality may become implausible when drawn from Lee-Carter 
methods and age-period grids. These biases are surprisingly large, even when the 
cohort profiles are created from single-age, single-year period data. The danger 
is that we overinterpret deviations from expected trends that were induced by 
our own data manipulation.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the societal cost of racial disparities 
in pneumococcal disease among US adults aged ≥  50 years.
METHODS: In a model-based analysis, societal costs of invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) and hospitalized nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBP) were 
estimated using (1) direct medical costs plus indirect costs of acute illness; 
(2) indirect costs of pneumococcal mortality; and (3) direct and indirect costs 
of related disability. Disparities costs were calculated as differences in 
average per-person pneumococcal disease cost between Black and non-Black adults 
aged ≥  50 years multiplied by the Black population aged ≥  50 years. Costs were 
in 2019 US dollars (US$), with future costs discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: Total direct and indirect costs per IPD case were US$186,791 in Black 
populations and US$182,689 in non-Black populations; total hospitalized NBP 
costs per case were US$100,632 (Black) and US$96,781 (non-Black). The difference 
in population per-person total pneumococcal disease costs between Black and 
non-Black adults was US$47.85. Combined societal costs of disparities for IPD 
and hospitalized NBP totaled US$673.2 million for Black adults aged ≥  50 years. 
Disease and disability risks, life expectancy, and case-fatality rates were 
influential in one-way sensitivity analyses, but the lowest cost across all 
analyses was US$194 million. The 95% probability range of racial disparity costs 
were US$227.2-US$1156.9 million in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: US societal cost of racial pneumococcal disease disparities in 
persons aged ≥ 50 years is substantial. Successful pneumococcal vaccination 
policy and programmatic interventions to mitigate these disparities could 
decrease costs and improve health.

Gut Frailty: Its Concept and Pathogenesis.

Naito Y(1).

Author information:
(1)Human Immunology and Nutrition Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of 
Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.

BACKGROUND: There is still a considerable gap between average life expectancy 
and healthy life expectancy in Japan. Recent research has revealed that gut 
frailty may be a worsening factor for various diseases, a cause of chronic 
inflammation, and a precursor to frailty.
SUMMARY: Among self-reported symptoms, constipation is particularly significant 
as one of the key symptoms of gut frailty. Studies have demonstrated that 
individuals with constipation have significantly lower survival rates and are 
also at a higher risk of developing various diseases such as chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like 
Parkinson's disease. Various molecular mechanisms could contribute to gut 
frailty, and the decrease in mucus secretion is an extremely early-stage 
pathology. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has a major impact on many conditions 
associated with gut frailty. Prebiotics, probiotics, post-biotics, and fecal 
microbiota transplantation are under investigation as a treatment option for gut 
frailty.
KEY MESSAGE: Although the concept of gut frailty has not yet gained widespread 
recognition, we hope to propose more practical screening methods, diagnostic 
approaches, and specific interventions in the future.

Following the economic and social state of humanity, Malaria is categorized as 
one of the life-threatening illness epidemics in under developed countries. For 
the eradication of the same, 1,2,4-trioxanes 17a1-a2, 17b1-b2, 17c1-c2 15a-c, 18 
and 19 have been synthesized continuing the creation of a novel series. 
Additionally, these novel compounds were tested for their effectiveness against 
the multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in mice model using both 
oral and intramuscular (im) administration routes. The two most potent compounds 
of the series, 17a1 and 17a2, demonstrated 100 % protection at 48 mg/kg x 4 days 
via oral route, which is twice as potent as artemisinin. In this model 
artemisinin provided 100 % protection at a dose of 48 mg/kg × 4 days and 80 % 
protection at 24 mg/kg × 4 days via im route.

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) are essential for triggering and relaying 
action potentials (AP), which perform critical functions in a variety of 
physiological processes, such as controlling muscle contractions and 
facilitating the release of neurotransmitters. In this study, we used a mouse 
C2C12 cell differentiation model to study the molecular expression and channel 
dynamics of VGSC and to investigate the exact role of VGSC in the development of 
muscle regeneration. Immunofluorescence, Real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction, Western blot, and whole-cell patch clamp were employed for this 
purpose in mouse myoblasts. The findings revealed an increase in intracellular 
sodium concentration, NaV1.4 gene expression, and protein expression with the 
progress of differentiation (days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7). Furthermore, VGSC dynamics 
exhibit the following characteristics: ① The increase of sodium current (INa); ② 
The decrease in the activation threshold and the voltage trigger maximum of INa; 
③ A positive shift in the steady-state inactivation curve; ④ The recovery of INa 
during repolarization is delayed, the activity-dependent decay rate of INa was 
accelerated, and the proportionate amount of the fraction of activated channels 
was reduced. Based on these results, it is postulated that the activation 
threshold of AP could be decreased, and the refractory period could be extended 
with the extension of differentiation duration, which may contribute to muscle 
contraction. Taken together, VGSC provides a theoretical and empirical basis for 
exploring potential targets for neuromuscular diseases and other therapeutic 
muscle regeneration dysfunctions.

With increasing human life expectancy, the global medical burden of chronic 
diseases is growing. Hence, chronic diseases are a pressing health concern and 
will continue to be in decades to come. Chronic diseases often involve multiple 
malfunctioning organs in the body. An imminent question is how interorgan 
crosstalk contributes to the etiology of chronic diseases. We conceived the 
locked-state model (LoSM), which illustrates how interorgan communication can 
give rise to body-wide memory-like properties that 'lock' healthy or 
pathological conditions. Next, we propose cutting-edge systems biology and 
artificial intelligence strategies to decipher chronic multiorgan locked states. 
Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of the LoSM and assess the power 
of systems-based therapies to dismantle pathological multiorgan locked states 
while improving treatments for chronic diseases.

This study utilized Italian ryegrass silage (IRGS) - based total mixed ration 
(TMR) as feedstuff and evaluated its effects on rumen fermentation, growth 
performance, blood parameters, and bacterial community in growing Hanwoo 
heifers. Twenty-seven Hanwoo heifers (body weight [BW], 225.11 ± 10.57 kg) were 
randomly allocated to three experimental diets. Heifers were fed 1 of 3 
treatments as follows: TMR with oat, timothy, and alfalfa hay (CON), TMR with 
19% of IRGS (L-IRGS), and TMR with 36% of IRGS (H-IRGS). Feeding high levels of 
IRGS (H-IRGS) and CON TMR to heifers resulted in a greater molar proportion of 
propionate in the rumen. The impact of different TMR diets on the BW, average 
daily gain, dry matter intake, and feed conversion ratio of Hanwoo heifers 
during the growing period did not differ (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the blood 
metabolites, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, and 
total cholesterol of the heifers were not affected by the different TMR diets (p 
> 0.05). In terms of rumen bacterial community composition, 264 operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) were observed across the three TMR diets with 240, 239, 
and 220 OTUs in CON, L-IRGS, and H-IRGS, respectively. IRGS-based diets 
increased the relative abundances of genera belonging to phylum Bacteroidetes 
but decreased the abundances of genus belonging to phylum Firmicutes compared 
with the control. Data showed that Bacteroidetes was the most dominant phylum, 
while Prevotella ruminicola was the dominant species across the three TMR 
groups. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus bromii in the rumen increased in 
heifers fed with high inclusion of IRGS in the TMR (H-IRGS TMR). The relative 
abundance of R. bromii in the rumen significantly increased when heifers were 
fed H-IRGS TMR while P. ruminicola increased in both L-IRGS and H-IRGS TMR 
groups. Results from the current study demonstrate that the inclusion of IRGS in 
the TMR is comparable with the TMR containing high-quality forage (CON). Thus, a 
high level of IRGS can be used as a replacement forage ingredient in TMR feeding 
and had a beneficial effect of possibly modulating the rumen bacterial community 
toward mainly propionate-producing microorganisms.

Because of the increased life expectancy, the aging population can participate 
in recreational sports activities. The fact that activity is promoted as having 
a positive effect on mental and physical health is another factor that may 
contribute to a trend of increased participation in sports activities by 
middle-aged and older patients. Due to age-related degeneration of tendons, 
muscles, joints and decreasing Bone Mineral Density, the musculoskeletal (MSK) 
system in the aging patient is more vulnerable to trauma. Therefore, 
sports-related lesions are commonly encountered in the daily routine of most 
imaging departments. In our radiological practice, we have seen a trend for an 
increase in sport-related injury referrals particularly in a population aged 40 
years and over. Currently, 10% of referrals for imaging studies for sport 
injuries are in patients older than 40-year-old. This article consists of a 
pictorial review of the imaging appearance of the most encountered MSK lesions 
in aging recreational sporters in a radiological practice according to their 
anatomical location. We have chosen the 15 most encountered acute and overuse 
sports-related lesions involving the lower and upper extremity that are referred 
to our department of medical imaging. We especially focus on the most 
characteristic imaging findings on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). Because of the high prevalence of MSK lesions in older asymptomatic 
patients, imaging findings must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical 
presentation.

Primary Care Physician Supply and Population Health Outcomes in Florida, 
2010-2019.

BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians play vital roles in the prevention and 
management of chronic disease. With increasing rates of chronic disease and a 
national primary care physician shortage, the role that primary care physician 
supply has on health outcomes in Florida is not well understood. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the relationship between primary care physician 
supply (PCPS) and population health outcomes of obesity, life expectancy, 
coronary artery disease hospitalization, and death rate as reported by county in 
the state of Florida for the years 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Secondary data was 
used from the Florida Department of Health. Numerous population health and 
social determinants of health variables related to PCPS in the literature were 
selected for analysis. Correlation and linear regression analyses were conducted 
using STATA14.
RESULTS: The association between PCPS and obesity was the strongest association 
in this analysis and was significant for each year with an average of 9.25 
primary care physicians per 100 000 people needed to decrease the obesity rate 
by 1%. PCPS was positively correlated with life expectancy for years 2013, 2016, 
and 2019 and negatively correlated with the death rate in 2010 and 2019. In the 
multiple regression, PCPS was negatively associated with areas having a high 
rate of uninsured persons, unemployment, decreased education, and age over 65.
CONCLUSION: Increased supply of primary care physicians in Florida is 
significantly associated with decreased rates of obesity and death and increased 
life expectancy. Our results also indicate that areas with higher levels of 
social vulnerability also have inequitable distributions of PCPS. Therefore, 
PCPS should be increased, particularly in areas with the highest need, as 
primary care physicians in the state of Florida play an important role in 
improving the overall health of the populations they serve.

PURPOSE: Improving glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is essential to 
reducing social and health-economic burden of diabetes-related complications. 
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been established as beneficial in 
improving glycaemic control and reducing hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 
diabetes, however data in T2D is limited. This study has been designed to assess 
the effect of initiating real-time CGM (rtCGM) on glycaemic control in a 
high-risk population of adults with T2D. Secondary objectives are to assess the 
cost-effectiveness and safety of rtCGM, and the effects of rtCGM on 
diet/lifestyle and the burden of diabetic complications, including 
cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at 
three sites in New Zealand (Waikato, Christchurch and Dunedin). Eighty adults 
with T2D on insulin with suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c > 8.0% or 
64 mmol/mol) will be randomised 1:1 to rtCGM or routine care with 
self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (SMBG) for three months. This 
intervention phase will be followed by a three-month continuation phase where 
SMBG group crossover to use rtCGM. Participants will then be invited to join the 
extension phase with continued use of rtCGM for a further 12 months. During the 
extension phase, both groups will independently titrate their insulin under the 
remote supervision of prescribing diabetes nurse specialists following an 
insulin titration algorithm. The primary outcome of the study is time in target 
glucose range (3.9-10 mmol/L or 70-180 mg/dL; TIR). Secondary outcomes include 
CGM metrics as per consensus statement recommendations, and HbA1c. Additional 
planned analyses include cardiovascular risk profile, incremental 
cost-effectiveness analyses, dietary patterns, and qualitative analyses.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial was registered with the Australian New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000889853) on 8 July 2021 and the 
World Health Organisation International Clinical Trial Registry Platform 
(Universal Trial Number U1111-1264-5822).

The effects of seaweed (Padina tetrastromatica, Sargassum natans, and Sargassum 
fluitans) ethanolic extracts on the quality and shelf life extension of Nile 
tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets were investigated during refrigerated 
storage for 20 days. Each of the seaweed ethanolic extracts solution (2%, w/v) 
was used for dipping the fish fillets for 10 min at 4°C. The control and seaweed 
extract-treated fillets were stored at 4 ± 1°C in air-tight polyethylene bags, 
and chemical, bacteriological, and sensory evaluation were performed at every 
4 days' intervals. During the storage period, P. tetrastromatica extract 
significantly (p < .05) reduced the increment of pH, peroxide value, 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and total volatile basic nitrogen 
values in Nile tilapia fillets compared to other seaweed extracts-treated and 
untreated fillets. The maximal total viable count of control, P. 
tetrastromatica, S. natans, and S. fluitans extracts-treated fillets was 6.53, 
7.11, 6.75, and 7.10 log CFU/g at the 8th, 20th, 12th, and 16th days of storage, 
respectively. The total psychrotrophic count of control and seaweed 
extracts-treated fillets was also significantly increased (p < .05) throughout 
the storage period. The P. tetrastromatica extracts-treated fillets showed 
better sensory characteristics than other seaweed extracts-treated and control 
fillets. Results of this study suggest that ethanolic extracts (2%, w/v) of P. 
tetrastromatica extend the shelf life for 12 days longer than the control 
fillets in refrigerated conditions.

In this study, changes in quality parameters of rainbow trout croquettes treated 
with dill extracts obtained by brewing (BDA) and distillation (DDA) methods were 
investigated during 61 days of refrigerated storage (+2 ± 1°C). Physicochemical, 
microbial, and sensory parameters of the rainbow trout croquettes were analyzed 
once every 4 days. It was observed that the precooking process and additives 
influenced the nutrient composition and color change of the croquettes. Total 
volatile base nitrogen and thiobarbituric acid values did not exceed the limit 
values in any group during refrigerated storage and these values were found as 
23.10 ± 0.89 mg/100 g and 3.13 ± 0.08 mg MDA/kg in the control group (C), 
21.00 ± 0.92 mg/100 g and 2.77 ± 0.14 mg MDA/kg in BDA group, and 
21.70 ± 0.92 mg/100 g and 2.85 ± 0.07 mg MDA/kg in DDA group, respectively. 
Extract treatments, especially DDA, resulted in a significant reduction in the 
counts of total aerobic mesophilic and psychotropic bacteria in trout croquettes 
compared to the control group. It was determined that the sensory scores of all 
croquette groups decreased during storage and the acceptability scores of the C, 
BDA, and DDA groups reached on the 33rd, 57th, and 61st days of storage, 
respectively. According to the results, this work demonstrated that the dill 
extracts both distilled and brewed can be used as a natural additive to improve 
the quality and extend the shelf life of rainbow trout croquettes.

Assessment of weather events impacts on forage production trend of 
sorghum-sudangrass hybrid.

Chuncheon 24341, Korea.

This study aimed to assess the impact of weather events on the 
sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor L.) cultivar production trend in the 
central inland region of Korea during the monsoon season, using time series 
analysis. The sorghum-sudangrass production data collected between 1988 and 2013 
were compiled along with the production year's weather data. The growing degree 
days (GDD), accumulated rainfall, and sunshine duration were used to assess 
their impacts on forage production (kg/ha) trend. Conversely, GDD and 
accumulated rainfall had positive and negative effects on the trend of forage 
production, respectively. Meanwhile, weather events such as heavy rainfall and 
typhoon were also collected based on weather warnings as weather events in the 
Korean monsoon season. The impact of weather events did not affect forage 
production, even with the increasing frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall. 
Therefore, the trend of forage production for the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid was 
forecasted to slightly increase until 2045. The predicted forage production in 
2045 will be 14,926 ± 6,657 kg/ha. It is likely that the damage by heavy 
rainfall and typhoons can be reduced through more frequent harvest against 
short-term single damage and a deeper extension of the root system against soil 
erosion and lodging. Therefore, in an environment that is rapidly changing due 
to climate change and extreme/abnormal weather, the cultivation of the 
sorghum-sudangrass hybrid would be advantageous in securing stable and robust 
forage production. Through this study, we propose the cultivation of 
sorghum-sudangrass hybrid as one of the alternative summer forage options to 
achieve stable forage production during the dynamically changing monsoon, in 
spite of rather lower nutrient value than that of maize (Zea mays L.).

The Relationship Between Global Left Ventricular Function, as Indicated by the 
Tei Index, and Long-Term Survival in Patients With Non-Ischemic, Dilated 
Cardiomyopathy.

AIM: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of low 
ejection fraction (EF) heart failure (HF). The Tei index is a reliable marker 
that reflects both left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, and it 
has prognostic value in patients with DCM. We aimed to investigate the 
relationship between the Tei index and long-term survival in non-ischemic, DCM 
patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study included 98 patients with non-ischemic 
DCM. The mean survival time of the patients was 59 mos.
RESULTS: The Tei index was prominently higher in patients who died (0.64±0.08 vs 
0.71±0.12, respectively; p=0.01). LV end-systolic volume and LV ejection 
fraction (LVEF) were independent prognostic factors and predicted worse 
long-term survival. Additionally, the patients with LVEF ≥32.7 % and the Tei 
index ≤0.76 had significantly longer survival.
CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the Tei index was significantly 
associated with mortality and the patients with both low LVEF (≤32.7 %) and high 
Tei index (≥0.76) values had a shorter life expectancy. As a result, we suggest 
that the Tei index may be a useful echocardiographic marker to predict long-term 
survival in DCM patients.
