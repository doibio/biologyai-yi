Recent scientific interest has been directed towards age-related diseases, 
driven by the significant increase in global life expectancy and the growing 
population of individuals aged 65 and above. The ageing process encompasses 
various biological, physiological, environmental, psychological, behavioural, 
and social changes, leading to an augmented susceptibility to chronic illnesses. 
Cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, liver and oncological diseases 
are prevalent in the elderly. Moreover, ageing individuals demonstrate reduced 
regenerative capacity and decreased tolerance towards therapeutic interventions, 
including organ transplantation. Liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, have 
emerged as significant public health concerns. Paradoxically, these conditions 
remain underestimated despite their substantial global impact. Age-related 
factors are closely associated with the severity and unfavorable prognosis of 
various liver diseases, warranting further investigation to enhance clinical 
management and develop novel therapeutic strategies. This comprehensive review 
focuses specifically on age-related liver diseases, their treatment strategies, 
and contemporary practices. It provides a detailed account of the global burden, 
types, molecular mechanisms, and epigenetic alterations underlying these liver 
pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: Infertility adversely affects the sexual reproductive health and 
overall quality of life of people. Recent estimates show that about one in six 
people (both men and women) experience infertility in their lifetime. This 
scoping review will, therefore, map the existing evidence on traditional 
management of female infertility in Africa including the effectiveness of the 
traditional healthcare systems, to inform policy and practice.
METHODS: The scoping review will be guided by the Arksey and O'Malley framework 
in conjunction with the Joanna Briggs Institute updated methodological guidance 
for scoping reviews. A search strategy will be developed, which will target the 
following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar and 
Africa-Wide Information including grey literature. The screening of titles, 
abstracts and full text will be done by two independent reviewers. Data will be 
extracted, analysed numerically and thematically. The reporting of the scoping 
review will use the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This scoping review will not require ethical approval 
as this is secondary analysis of peer-reviewed articles. The findings of the 
review will be disseminated on various platforms including conferences, meetings 
to key stakeholders and in a peer-reviewed journal for wider sharing.

PURPOSE: The number of elderly patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer 
(CRC) is increasing. Considering short life expectancy and multiple 
comorbidities, surgery may not always be the best treatment option.
METHODS: We included all consecutive patients aged 80 years and older who 
underwent elective resection for CRC following Enhanced Recovery after Surgery 
(ERAS) protocol between January 2011 and May 2021. The primary endpoint was 
overall survival, secondary endpoints were 30-day morbidity, and the rate of 
return to pre-operative living conditions 3 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included. Mean age was 84.6 ± 3.6 years, 49 
patients (52%) were female. Most patients (77.6%) were ASA score ≥ 3. 
Laparoscopic resections were performed in 85 patients (90.4%), involving 69 
(73.4%) colonic and 25 (26.6%) rectal resections. A stoma was constructed in 22 
patients (23%), and reversed in 12 (54.5%). Twenty-two patients (23.4%) 
experienced a Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 complication, and 2 patients (2.1%) died. The 
median length of hospital stay was 8 (interquartiles: 6-15) days. Sixty-six 
patients (70.2%) were discharged home directly and 26 (27.7%) to rehabilitation 
or postacute care institutes. At three months after surgery, eighty-two patients 
(96.5%) returned to their pre-operative living conditions directly or after 
short-term rehabilitation. Mean follow-up was 53 ± 33 months, estimated 5-year 
overall survival was 60.3% (95%CI 49.5-71.1%), and disease-free survival was 
86.3% (95%CI 78.1-94.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that elderly patients undergoing elective 
surgery have a high potential to return to preoperative living conditions and 
good overall- and disease-free survivals, despite significant postoperative 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have indicated an association between red and 
processed meat consumption and the incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). In 
this study, we aimed to assess the burden of IHD caused by a diet high in red 
and processed meat in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019, using 
data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2019, which included the number of 
deaths, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and age-standardized DALYs rates (ASDR) attributed to IHD caused by a 
diet high in red and processed meat. We then calculated the burden of IHD 
attributable to a high intake of red and processed meat in each country and 
territory, stratified by age, sex, and socio-demographic index (SDI).
RESULTS: Globally, a high intake of red meat was responsible for 351,200 (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI): 559,000-642,700) deaths from IHD in 2019, while a 
high intake of processed meat was associated with 171,700 (95% UI: 
30,100-320,000) deaths from IHD. Between 1990 and 2019, while the corresponding 
age-standardized rates declined, the numbers of deaths and DALYs increased. 
China had the highest number of deaths [98,386.9 (95% UI: 14,999.3-189,812.7)] 
caused by a high intake of red meat, while United States of America [33,129.6 
(95% UI: 7,150-59,593.8)] was associated with the highest number of deaths 
caused by high intake of processed meat for IHD in 2019. Males experienced a 
greater burden of IHD caused by a high intake of red and processed meat than 
females. The ASMR and ASDR of IHD attributed to a high intake of red meat 
decreased in countries with high SDI, high-middle SDI and low SDI, while the 
ASMR and ASDR of IHD attributed to a high intake of processed meat decreased 
only in countries with high SDI and high-middle SDI.
CONCLUSION: Although there is a decline in the ASMR and ASDR of IHD caused by a 
high intake of red and processed meat, there is also an increase in deaths and 
DALYs number globally. Additionally, there is a heterogeneous burden of IHD 
related to a high intake of red and processed meat across regions and countries, 
with males experiencing a greater burden than females. Implementing targeted 
policies and interventions is required to reduce the burden of IHD caused by a 
high intake of red and processed meat.

BACKGROUND: Green chili is the predominant vegetable in tropical and subtropical 
regions with high economic value. However, after harvest, it exhibits vigorous 
metabolic activities due to the high moisture level, leading to a reduction in 
bioactive compounds and hence reduced shelf life and nutritional quality. Low 
temperature storage results in the onset of chilling injury symptoms. Therefore, 
developing techniques to increase the shelf life of green chilies and safeguard 
their nutritional value has become a serious concern for researchers. In this 
regard, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of the alone or 
combined application of hot water treatment (HWT) (45 °C for 15 min) and 
eucalyptus leaf extract (ELE) (30%) on 'Golden Hot' chilies in comparison to the 
control. After treatment, chilies were stored at 20 ± 1.5 °C for 20 days.
RESULTS: HWT + ELE-treated chilies had a significant reduction in fruit weight 
loss (14.6%), fungal decay index (35%), red chili percentage (41.2%), soluble 
solid content (42.9%), ripening index (48.9%), and reactive oxygen species 
production like H2O2 (55.1%) and O-2 (46.5%) during shelf in comparison to 
control, followed by the alone application of HWT and ELE. Furthermore, the 
combined use of HWT and ELE effectively improved the antioxidative properties of 
stored chilies including DPPH radical scavenging activities (54.6%), ascorbic 
acid content (28.4%), phenolic content (31.8%), as well as the enzyme activities 
of POD (103%), CAT (128%), SOD (26.5%), and APX (43.8%) in comparison to the 
control. Additionally, the green chilies underwent HWT + ELE treatment 
also exhibited higher chlorophyll levels (100%) and general appearance (79.6%) 
with reduced anthocyanin content (40.8%) and wrinkling (43%), leading to a 
higher marketable fruit (41.3%) than the control.
CONCLUSION: The pre-storage application of HWT and ELE could be used as an 
antimicrobial, non-chemical, non-toxic, and eco-friendly treatment for 
preserving the postharvest quality of green chilies at ambient temperature 
(20 ± 1.5 °C).

BACKGROUND: Two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) 
is one of the most important plant pests in the world. Due to increased 
resistance of mites to acaricides, it is necessary to use other methods such as 
inducing resistance in plants by natural compounds for pests' management. 
Polyamins such as spermine are effective in increasing plant resistance to 
biotic and abiotic stressors. In this research, the effect of spermine 
treatments in cucumber plants on life table parameters of T. urticae was 
investigated. Also, top-down effect of spermine and T. urticae on cucumber 
biochemical parameters was measured. In the experiments, 1, 2 and 3 mM spermine 
concentrations were used.
RESULTS: Amongst the spermine treatments, those mites that fed on cucumbers 
which received 1 mM spermine showed the shortest protonymphal period and higher 
ovipositon period, fecundity, gross and net reproductive rates and life 
expectancy compare to control. Treatment with 2 mM spermine lead to the longest 
teleochrysalis period and shortest range of age-stage-specific fecundity period. 
In addition, 2 mM spermine lowered intrinsic and finite rate of population 
increase in T. urticae. The longest larval period of T. urticae was observed in 
3 mM spermine. Feeding of T. urticae from cucumber plants increased hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage (EL) level 
and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity but inhibited catalase (CAT) activity in 
this plant. Infested cucumber plants treated with 2 mM spermine showed lower 
H2O2 and MDA content and highest activity of APX and CAT on day 1 and 3 compare 
to the others. The 3 mM spermine increased H2O2 content in infested plants 
during the whole experiment as well as non-infested plants in day 5 and 9 only. 
This treatment induced the highest MDA content and lowest catalase activity on 
day1, 3 and 5 of experiment in infested plants.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that 2 mM spermine was the only effective 
concentration that reduce cucumber sensitivity to T. urticae. The trend of 
changes in biochemical parameters, especially H2O2, in 3 mM spermine was 
abnormal, and this concentration could be considered toxic.

OBJECTIVE: Agricultural producers face a wide array of stress triggers, shocks, 
and long-term pressures such as drought, flooding, fire, government policies, 
financial insecurity, and physical injuries. Extant research has revealed that 
mental health stigma, lack of access to care in rural areas, and negative coping 
responses (alcohol abuse, suicide, prescription drugs use) exacerbate the 
challenge of producer responses to short and long-term adversity. Resilience, 
the traits, processes, and capacities of producers to adapt and transform their 
approach to farming or ranching, when necessary, in response to stress triggers 
or long-term pressures, has received less research attention, particularly in 
the Western United States. The purpose of the study was to apply an 
interactionist occupational resilience theoretical perspective to the 
investigation of contextual factors contributing to resilience in Western United 
States agricultural producers.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews (45 to 90 minutes) were conducted with 
agricultural producers (n=51) from Western states and territories. Applied 
thematic analysis with a phenomenological lens was utilized to analyze interview 
transcriptions. First and second level coding were conducted to derive themes.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that resilience is based upon the interactions 
between traits of producers and the context of agriculture. Four themes were 
generated (Agricultural Life, External Stressors, Traits and Adaptations, and 
Supports and Resources), supported by subthemes. The themes and subthemes are 
depicted in an agricultural producer resiliency model. The findings shed light 
on the equivocal role of neighbors in providing support for each other and the 
double-edged sword of co-working with family.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore that social capital is an important 
mechanism for supporting farmers and ranchers, as those with stronger social 
resources are more resilient. We recommend more funding to tailor stress and 
mental health programming to the specifics of agriculture, integration of 
behavioral health in primary care as a mechanism to increase access to care, and 
more intentional technical assistance for farmers and ranchers on strategic 
planning and problem solving.

PURPOSE: This study examines long-term benefit on functional outcomes and 
quality of life after selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) in children with spastic 
diplegia in Hong Kong.
METHOD: This is a case control study. Individuals with spastic diplegia who were 
at 6 to 12 years post-SDR were recruited. Age, gender, cognition, and Gross 
Motor Function Classification System level-matched individuals with spastic 
diplegia who had not undergone SDR were recruited as controls. Outcome measures 
included physical level, functional level, physiological level, and quality of 
life. All data were compared by independent t-test.
RESULTS: Individuals post-SDR (n = 15) demonstrated a significantly better range 
of ankle dorsiflexion in knee extension by - 5.7 ± 10.9° than the control group 
(n = 12). No other significant differences were observed.
CONCLUSION: SDR is a safe, one-off procedure and provides long-term reduction in 
spasticity with no major complications. With the heterogeneity, we did not 
demonstrate between-group differences in long-term functional outcomes.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) or progeria is a rare genetic 
disease that causes premature aging, leading to a drastic reduction in the life 
expectancy of patients. Progeria is mainly caused by the intracellular 
accumulation of a defective protein called progerin, generated from a mutation 
in the LMNA gene. Currently, there is only one approved drug for the treatment 
of progeria, which has limited efficacy. It is believed that progerin levels are 
the most important biomarker related to the severity of the disease. However, 
there is a lack of effective tools to directly visualize progerin in the native 
cellular models, since the commercially available antibodies are not well suited 
for the direct visualization of progerin in cells from the mouse model of the 
disease. In this context, an alternative option for the visualization of a 
protein relies on the use of fluorescent chemical probes, molecules with 
affinity and specificity towards a protein. In this work we report the synthesis 
and characterization of a new fluorescent probe (UCM-23079) that allows for the 
direct visualization of progerin in cells from the most widely used progeroid 
mouse model. Thus, UCM-23079 is a new tool compound that could help prioritize 
potential preclinical therapies towards the final goal of finding a definitive 
cure for progeria.

The USA spends more in healthcare per capita than any other country in the 
world, but ranks last among high-income industrialized nations in major markers 
of healthcare effectiveness such as life expectancy, maternal mortality, 
neonatal mortality, and infant mortality. Unlike other high-income 
industrialized nations, the USA does not have a national agency that 
systematically evaluates the cost-effectiveness of health care interventions and 
negotiates their price accordingly. This manuscript aims to introduce the 
rationale, terminology, advantages, and limitations of cost-effectiveness 
analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis compares health interventions and 
evaluates their incremental value and their incremental cost compared with 
already existing healthcare interventions. Cost-effectiveness analysis 
integrates the best available evidence with patients' preferences to inform 
clinical decision making. Patients with neurological conditions are facing 
increasing challenges to access healthcare and prescription drugs. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis may help improve access to the most effective 
healthcare interventions and prescription drugs while containing healthcare 
costs.

Niemann-Pick disease is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage 
disorder. The pathophysiological background for this condition is the deficiency 
or reduced function of the enzyme sphingomyelinase, as well as a deficiency in 
the intracellular cholesterol transporter protein. Due to the breakdown defect, 
sphingomyelin and cholesterol accumulate in the lysosomes of cells. The disease 
is divided into 5 subtypes (A, A/B, B, C, D). The authors present the case of a 
24-year-old young man diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease type B as a child, 
focusing on the ophthalmic manifestation of the disease. During the examination 
of the patient, fundus photographs and fundus autofluorescence imaging were 
taken, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography 
angiography (OCTA), and visual field (perimetry) examinations were performed. 
The characteristic macular halo and the cherry-red spot in the fovea were 
clearly visible during ophthalmoscopy and on the fundus photographs. The OCT 
images showed focal thickening with high reflectivity in the ganglion cell layer 
corresponding to the macular halo, and the area of the foveola was spared. With 
visual field examination, an intact field of vision was found on both eyes. 
Similar to the presented patient, symptoms in patients with the B subtype are 
milder, and besides the visceral symptoms, there are no neurological symptoms, 
and the specific ophthalmic abnormalities do not cause visual impairment. 
Currently, Niemann-Pick disease is considered a rare disease, and the diagnosis 
of the patients is often delayed or even missed due to non-specific or mild 
symptoms. Through consultation between medical specialties, ophthalmological 
examination can also contribute to the correct diagnosis in cases with mild 
general symptoms. Timely diagnosis can potentially lead to mitigation of 
symptoms thanks to the ever-expanding therapeutic options, stabilization of the 
disease progression, and increase of the patients' life expectancy. Orv Hetil.

Publisher: A Niemann–Pick-betegség a lizoszomális tárolási betegségek 
csoportjába tartozó ritka, autoszomális recesszíven öröklődő betegség. 
Hátterében a szfingomielináz enzim hiánya vagy csökkent működése, illetve az 
intracelluláris koleszterintranszporter fehérje deficientiája áll, és a 
lebontási zavar miatt a sejtek lizoszómáiban szfingomielin és koleszterin 
szaporodik fel. A betegség 5 altípusát (A, A/B, B, C, D) különböztetjük meg. A 
szerzők egy 24 éves, gyermekkorában B-típusú Niemann–Pick-betegséggel 
diagnosztizált fiatal férfi esetét mutatják be, különös tekintettel a betegség 
szemészeti manifesztációjára. A beteg vizsgálata során fundusfotók és 
fundusautofluoreszcencia-felvételek készültek, továbbá 
optikaikoherencia-tomográfiás (OCT-), OCT-angiográfiás (OCTA-) és látótér 
(perimetria)-vizsgálatok történtek. A szemfenék vizsgálatakor, illetve a 
fundusfotókon jól látszott a betegségre jellegzetes macularis gyűrű alakú udvar 
(továbbiakban halo) és a cseresznyepiros folt a foveában. Az OCT-felvételeken a 
macularis halo megfelelően nagy reflektivitású, fokális megvastagodás 
ábrázolódott a ganglionsejtrétegben, a foveola területe megkímélt volt. A 
látótérvizsgálattal mindkét szem látótere ép volt. A bemutatott páciens esetéhez 
hasonlóan a B-altípusba tartozó betegeknél a tünetek enyhébbek, a visceralis 
tünetek mellett idegrendszeri tünetek nincsenek, és a specifikus szemészeti 
eltérések nem okoznak látásromlást. Jelenleg a Niemann–Pick-betegség ritka 
betegségnek számít, sok esetben a betegek diagnózisa késik vagy akár el is 
maradhat az aspecifikus vagy enyhe tünetek miatt. A szakterületek közötti 
konzultáció révén belgyógyászati szempontból tünetszegény esetekben a szemészeti 
vizsgálat is hozzájárulhat a jó diagnózishoz. Az időben történő diagnózissal a 
tünetek az egyre bővülő terápiás lehetőségeknek köszönhetően mérsékelhetők, a 
betegség progressziója stabilizálható, a betegek élettartama így növekedhet. Orv

BACKGROUND: There has been a dearth of research into the benefits of water-based 
workouts for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effect of Aqua Stretch and Aqua 
Pilates in improving quality of life (QOL), function, and pain in AS patients.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 40 patients, who were randomly assigned to 
the Aqua Pilates, Aqua Stretch, and control groups. The experimental groups 
attended interventions for six-week. QOL, pain intensity, function, and fatigue 
were measured before and after treatments.
RESULTS: Except for the chest expanding, all variables in the Aqua Stretch group 
changed significantly after six weeks (p< 0.05). QOL (p= 0.002), 6MWT (p= 
0.016), and Schober flexion (p= 0.011) showed changes, while BASDAI (p= 0.0001), 
VAS (p= 0.0001), fatigue (p= 0.0001), and Schober extension (p= 0.028) showed 
significant decreases. Except for chest expansion and Schober extension, which 
did not alter significantly after six-week of Aqua Pilates (p> 0.05), all other 
variables did. There was an increasing trend in 6MWT and Schober flexion (p= 
0.021) and a decreasing trend in BASDAI (p= 0.002), VAS (p= 0.0001) and fatigue 
(p= 0.002). Except for QOL (p= 0.016), no statistically significant differences 
were found between the groups.
CONCLUSION: All variables had a significant change after six-week Aqua Stretch, 
except for the chest expanding. Chest expanding and Schober extension were the 
variables which had no significant change after six-week Aqua Pilates. With the 
exception of QOL, no statistically significant differences were found between 
the groups. Aqua Stretch had the greatest effect on the VAS, as measured by the 
minimum clinically relevant differences (MCID). Moreover, in Aqua Stretch alone, 
there was a notable impact on fatigue, QOL, and the BASDAI.

PURPOSE: To quantify the cost-utility ratio of the ranibizumab Port Delivery 
System (PDS) (SUSVIMO) versus intravitreal ranibizumab injections for treating 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) based upon Archway Phase 3 
Trial data DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
SUBJECTS: Archway Phase 3 Clinical Trial nAMD participants previously responsive 
to anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy were randomized 3:2. 
Two hundred forty received Port Delivery System refills q 24 weeks and 162 
received ranibizumab injections.
METHODS: Intervention, or Testing: Ophthalmic patient, time tradeoff utilities, 
direct medical and societal cost perspectives, 12-year, 1-year, and 5-year 
timelines, US 2022 real dollars, and a 3% annual discount rate were employed. 
Utilities were adjusted for nAMD conversion in fellow eyes during the 12-year, 
mean participant life expectancy. Premature death associated with severe vision 
loss was integrated as per the population-based Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QALY (quality-adjusted life-year) accruals, costs, and 
incremental and average cost-utility ratios in $/QALY (dollars expended per QALY 
gained).
RESULTS: Versus no therapy, the one-year PDS QALY gain was .0453 (5.9%) versus 
.0063 (.82%) for intravitreal injections (p < .001), while the respective 
12-year QALY gains were 1.714 (28%) and 1.639 (26.8%) (p = 0.99). One-year 
direct PDS ophthalmic costs totaled $21,825 with two ranibizumab fills, while 
ranibizumab injection therapy totaled $18,405 with 11.8 injections. The one-year 
incremental PDS $/QALY versus injections was cost-effective at $75,497/QALY. 
Five-year PDS therapy was not incrementally cost-effective at $304,108/QALY, nor 
was the twelve-year therapy at $761,646/QALY. Average 12-year CURs were 
$78,773/QALY for the PDS and $47,917/QALY for injection therapy. Adding 
-$476,442 12-year offsetting societal costs netted $314,521 to society per PDS 
participant versus $370,958 per participant for injection therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab PDS therapy was not incrementally cost-effective versus 
ranibizumab injection therapy at twelve or five years but was at one year. 
Injection therapy had a more favorable 12-year average cost-utility ratio. 
Vision gain was the major determinant of participant value gain and was the same 
for both interventions. Both interventions were highly cost-effective utilizing 
average cost-utility analysis with the societal cost perspective.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: There is currently no doubt that a kidney 
transplant with good function is the best treatment we can offer a child with 
severe kidney failure, improving their growth, development and life in general. 
But there are few works that follow these patients over the years to find out 
what their life is like as adults, their achievements and if there are any 
difficulties that may have arisen from their illness. That has been the 
objective of this work.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have collected the evolution of 287 patients who 
received at least one kidney transplant in pediatric age, analyzing not only the 
survival of grafts and recipients but, fundamentally, their current quality of 
life.
RESULTS: Over a 40-year period (1979-2019), 345 kidney transplants were 
performed in 287 pediatric recipients, with a rate of retransplantation before 
reaching the age of majority of 16.7%. Survival, both of patients and grafts, 
has improved remarkably in the last 20 years. The survival of transplanted 
patients in the period from 1979 to 1996 at 10, 20 and 25 years after the 
intervention was 83%, 76% and 65% respectively, and 94% and 82% at 10 and 20 
years respectively in those transplanted in the period from 1997 to 2019. Graft 
survival in the period from 1979 to 1996 at 10 and 20 years was 39% and 18%, 
increasing in the second period to 68% and 34% respectively. Survival of the 
first living donor graft (LD) at 5 and 10 years was 94% and 89%. Currently 150 
of these patients are adults. Of these, 32% have a stable partner and 6.6% have 
children. The level of training is lower than that of the general population and 
many of them have other comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy of pediatric patients with kidney failure 
transplanted during childhood has improved markedly in recent decades, as has 
graft survival, being better with a living donor. In general, they consider 
themselves satisfied with their lives, with great acceptance of their illness 
and limitations, but -analyzing their testimonies- we conclude that they lack 
social support, both for themselves and their families, to achieve a higher 
level of education and better quality of life.

Indigenous and traditional practices based on ethnoecological knowledge are 
fundamental to biodiversity stewardship and sustainable use. Knowledge 
partnerships between Indigenous Peoples, traditional local communities, and 
ecologists can produce richer and fairer understandings of nature. We identify 
key topical areas where such collaborations can positively transform science, 
policy, and practice.

Population structure and lifestyles may have contributed to the epidemiological 
status of Chronic Kidney Disease due to Type 2 Diabetes (CKD-T2D). This study is 
a secondary data analysis. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, 
we describe the changes in CKD-T2D burden and its influencing factors in the 
population aged 20-59 years from 1990 to 2019. Globally, the incidence, death, 
and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rate of CKD-T2D showed an upward 
trend and increased with age, and the burden in males was higher than that in 
females. Population growth and aging were important driving factors for the 
increase of CKD-T2D DALY burden, while high systolic blood pressure and high 
body-mass index were the primary attributable risk factors. High body-mass index 
exhibited higher contributions to high Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI) 
countries, whereas low SDI countries were more impacted by high systolic blood 
pressure. The population attributable fraction of CKD-T2D DALY caused by high 
body-mass index was positively correlated with SDI, while high temperature and 
lead exposure were negatively correlated. Therefore, strengthening disease 
screening for people aged 20-59 years and formulating early intervention 
measures based on the level of socioeconomic development may effectively 
alleviate the burden of CKD-T2D.

Low efficiency of nerve growth and unstable release of loaded drugs have become 
a major problem in repairing peripheral nerve injury. Many intervention 
strategies were focused on simple drug loading, but have still been less 
effective. The key challenge is to establish a controlled release 
microenvironment to enable adequate nerve regeneration. In this study, we 
fabricate a multilayered compound nerve scaffold by electrospinning: with an 
anti-adhesive outer layer of polycaprolactone and an ECM-like inner layer 
consisting of a melatonin-loaded alginate hydrogel. We characterized the 
scaffold, and the loaded melatonin can be found to undergo controlled release. 
We applied them to a 15 mm rat model of sciatic nerve injury. After 16 weeks, 
the animals in each group were evaluated and compared for recovery of motor 
function, electrophysiology, target organ atrophy status, regenerative nerve 
morphology and relative protein expression levels of neural markers, 
inflammatory oxidative stress, and angiogenesis. We identify that the scaffold 
can improve functional ability evidenced by an increased sciatic functional 
index and nerve electrical conduction level. The antioxidant melatonin loaded in 
the scaffold reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in the reinnervated 
nerves, confirmed by increased HO-1 and decreased TNF-α levels in regenerating 
nerves. The relative expression of fast-type myosin was elevated in the target 
gastrocnemius muscle. An improvement in angiogenesis facilitates neurite 
extension and axonal sprouting. This scaffold can effectively restore the 
ECM-like microenvironment and improve the quality of nerve regeneration by 
controlled melatonin release, thus enlightening the design criteria on nerve 
scaffolds for peripheral nerve injury in the future.

As the life expectancy in thalassemia is improving, pain is being recognized as 
an emerging problem. To document the pain prevalence and severity in patients 
with transfusion-dependent thalassemia all transfusion-dependent thalassemia 
patients >10 years of age (n = 165) attending the Thalassemia Day Care Center 
were assessed for pain prevalence, severity, and its effect on various life 
activities using the Brief Pain Inventory. Their medical records were reviewed 
for the presence of various co-morbidities. Pain was reported by 62.4% of 
participants with 35.2% and 59.4% of participants, reporting pain in the past 1 
and 4 weeks respectively. A significantly higher pain prevalence was reported in 
females (p = .037), patients residing in urban areas (p = .038), and employed 
participants (p = .038). The commonest sites of pain were the lower back and 
calves. General activity (p = .02) and enjoyment of life (p = .02) were 
significantly affected due to pain in patients between 21 and 30 years of age. 
Female participants reported interference of pain with mood (p = .03). A 
significant correlation of pain prevalence was found with higher average serum 
ferritin (p = .015), moderate to severe liver iron concentration (p = .04), and 
lower levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (p = .03). Pain is an emerging cause 
of morbidity in thalassemia. The study found a significant association of pain 
with modifiable factors such as serum ferritin, LIC, and 25 (OH) vitamin D 
levels.

The Impact of Rapidly Progressing Neurodegenerative Disorders on Caregivers: An 
Integrative Literature Review.

Mossa A, Mayahara M, Emezue C, Paun O.

Neurodegenerative disorders affect over 6 million people in the United States. A 
subset of these patients experiences symptoms that progress rapidly, along with 
a 5- to 10-year life expectancy (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). This subgroup
