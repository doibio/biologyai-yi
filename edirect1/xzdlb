INTRODUCTION: Treatment toxicities are common in older adults with cancer and 
consequently, treatment modifications are sometimes considered. We evaluated the 
prevalence and factors associated with treatment modifications at the first 
cycle in older patients receiving palliative systemic treatment.
METHODS: Patients (n = 369) from the GAP 70+ Trial (NCT02054741; PI: Mohile) 
usual care arm were included. Enrolled patients were aged 70+ with advanced 
cancer and ≥ 1 Geriatric Assessment (GA) domain impairment. Treatment 
modification was defined as any change from National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines or published clinical trials. Baseline variables included: 1) 
sociodemographic factors; 2) clinical variables; 3) GA domains; and 4) physician 
beliefs about life expectancy. Bivariate analyses and multivariable 
cluster-weighted generalized estimating equation model were conducted to assess 
the association of baseline variables with cycle 1 treatment modifications.
RESULTS: Mean age was 77.2 years (range: 70-94); 62% had lung or 
gastrointestinal cancers, and 35% had treatment modifications at cycle 1. 
Increasing age by one year (odds ratio (OR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.0-1.2), receipt of ≥second line of chemotherapy (OR 1.8, CI 1.1-3.0), 
functional impairment (OR 1.6, CI 1.1-2.3) and income ≤$50,000 (OR 1.7, CI 
1.1-2.4) were independently associated with a higher likelihood of cycle 1 
treatment modification.
CONCLUSION: Treatment modifications occurred in 35% of older adults with 
advanced cancer at cycle 1. Increasing age, receipt of ≥second line of 
chemotherapy, functional impairment, and lower income were independently 
associated with treatment modifications. These findings emphasize the need for 
evidence-based regimens in older adults with cancer and GA impairments.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether communicating personalised statin 
therapy-effects obtained by prognostic algorithm leads to lower decisional 
conflict associated with statin use in patients with stable cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) compared with standard (non-personalised) therapy-effects.
DESIGN: Hypothesis-blinded, three-armed randomised controlled trial SETTING AND 
PARTICIPANTS: 303 statin users with stable CVD enrolled in a cohort 
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to standard practice 
(control-group) or one of two intervention arms. Intervention arms received 
standard practice plus (1) a personalised health profile, (2) educational videos 
and (3) a structured telephone consultation. Intervention arms received 
personalised estimates of prognostic changes associated with both 
discontinuation of current statin and intensification to the most potent statin 
type and dose (ie, atorvastatin 80 mg). Intervention arms differed in how these 
changes were expressed: either change in individual 10-year absolute CVD risk 
(iAR-group) or CVD-free life-expectancy (iLE-group) calculated with the 
SMART-REACH model (http://U-Prevent.com).
OUTCOME: Primary outcome was patient decisional conflict score (DCS) after 
1 month. The score varies from 0 (no conflict) to 100 (high conflict). Secondary 
outcomes were collected at 1 or 6 months: DCS, quality of life, illness 
perception, patient activation, patient perception of statin efficacy and shared 
decision-making, self-reported statin adherence, understanding of 
statin-therapy, post-randomisation low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 
physician opinion of the intervention. Outcomes are reported as median (25th- 
75th percentile).
RESULTS: Decisional conflict differed between the intervention arms: median 
control 27 (20-43), iAR-group 22 (11-30; p-value vs control 0.001) and iLE-group 
25 (10-31; p-value vs control 0.021). No differences in secondary outcomes were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: In patients with clinically manifest CVD, providing personalised 
estimations of treatment-effects resulted in a small but significant decrease in 
decisional conflict after 1 month. The results support the use of personalised 
predictions for supporting decision-making.

Expectile regression can be used to analyze the entire conditional distribution 
of a response, omitting all distributional assumptions. Among its benefits are 
computational simplicity, efficiency, and the possibility to incorporate a 
semiparametric predictor. Due to its advantages in full data settings, we 
propose an extension to right-censored data situations, where conventional 
methods typically focus only on mean effects. We propose to extend expectile 
regression with inverse probability weights. Estimates are easy to implement and 
computationally simple. Expectiles can be converted to more easily interpreted 
tail expectations, that is, the expected residual life. It provides a meaningful 
effect measure, similar to the hazard rate. The results from an extensive 
simulation study are presented, evaluating consistency and sensitivity to 
violations of assumptions. We use the proposed method to analyze survival times 
of colorectal cancer patients from a regional certified high volume cancer 
center.

Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are known to exhibit in vitro chaperone 
activity by suppressing the aggregation of misfolded proteins. The 12-kDa sHSPs 
(Hsp12s) subfamily members from Caenorhabditis elegans, including Hsp12.2, 
Hsp12.3, and Hsp12.6, however, are devoid of such chaperone activity, and their 
in vivo functions are poorly understood. Here we verified that Hsp12.1, similar 
to its homologs Hsp12.2, Hsp12.3, and Hsp12.6, hardly exhibited any chaperone 
activity. Strikingly, we demonstrated that these Hsp12s seem to play crucial 
physiological roles in C. elegans, for suppressing dauer formation and promoting 
both longevity and reproduction. A unique sHSP gene from Filarial nematode worm 
Brugia malayi was identified such that it encodes two products, one as a 
full-length Hsp12.6 protein and the other one having an N-terminal arm of normal 
length but lacks the C-terminal extension. This gene may represent an 
intermediate form in evolution from a common sHSP to a Hsp12. Together, our 
study offers insights on what biological functions the chaperone-defective sHSPs 
may exhibit and also implicates an evolutionary scenario for the unique Hsp12s 
subfamily.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the 
lifetime costs of patients receiving treatment for follicular lymphoma (FL) in 
the United States.
METHODS: A Markov model was programmed in hēRo3 with a 6-month cycle length, 
35-year time horizon (lifetime projection), and health states for line of 
treatment, response, receipt of maintenance therapy among responders, 
transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), development of second 
primary malignancy (SPM), and death. The model was used to estimate the expected 
lifetime costs of FL (in 2019 USD), including costs of drug acquisition and 
administration, transplant procedures, radiotherapy, adverse events, follow-up, 
DLBCL, SPM, end-of-life care, and indirect costs. Model inputs were based on 
published sources.
RESULTS: In the US, patients with FL receiving treatment have a life expectancy 
of approximately 14.5 years from initiation of treatment and expected lifetime 
direct and indirect costs of US$515,884. Costs of drugs for induction therapy 
represent the largest expenditure (US$233,174), followed by maintenance therapy 
costs (US$88,971) and terminal care costs (US$57,065). Despite the relatively 
advanced age of these patients, indirect costs (due to patient morbidity and 
mortality and caregiver lost work time) represent a substantial share of total 
costs (US$40,280). Treated FL patients spend approximately 6.9 years in the 
health states associated with first-line therapy. Approximately 66 and 46% 
continue to second- and third-line therapies, respectively. The mean (95% 
credible interval) of expected lifetime costs based on the probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses was US$559,202 (421,997-762,553).
CONCLUSIONS: In the US, the expected lifetime costs of care for FL patients who 
receive treatment is high. The results highlight the potential economic benefits 
that might be achieved by treatments for FL that prevent or delay disease 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Considerable health inequities documented in Israel between 
communities, populations and regions, undermine the rights of all citizens to 
optimal health. The first step towards health equity is agreement on a set of 
national indicators, reflecting equity in healthcare provision and health 
outcomes, and allowing monitoring of the impact of interventions on the 
reduction of disparities. We describe the process of reaching a consensus on a 
defined set of national equity indicators.
METHODS: The study was conducted between January 2019 and June 2020, in a 
multistage design: (A) Identifying appropriate and available inequity measures 
via interviews with stakeholders. (B) Agreement on the screening criteria 
(public health importance; gap characteristics; potential for change; public 
interest) and relative weighting. (C) Constructing the consultation framework as 
an online, 3-round Delphi technique, with a range of experts recruited from the 
health, welfare and education sectors.
RESULTS: Participants were of diverse age, gender, geographic location, religion 
and ethnicity, and came from academia, healthcare provision, government 
ministries and patient representative groups. Thirty measures of inequity, 
presented to participants, represented the following domains: Health promotion 
(11 indicators), acute and chronic morbidity (11), life expectancy and mortality 
(2), health infrastructures and affordability of care (4), education and 
employment (2). Of the 77 individuals contacted, 75 (97%) expressed willingness 
to participate, and 55 (73%) completed all three scoring rounds. The leading ten 
indicators were: Diabetes care, childhood obesity, adult obesity, distribution 
of healthcare personnel, fatal childhood injuries, cigarette smoking, infant 
mortality, ability to afford care, access to psychotherapy and distribution of 
hospital beds. Agreement among raters, measured as intra-class correlation 
coefficient (ICC), was 0.75.
CONCLUSION: A diverse range of consultants reached a consensus on the most 
important national equity indicators, including both clinical and system 
indicators. Results should be used to guide governmental decision-making and 
inter-sectoral strategies, furthering the pursuit of a more equitable healthcare 
system.

BACKGROUND: Ambient fine particle (PM2.5) pollution is an important public 
health problem in China. Short-term ambient PM2.5 exposure is associated with 
increased mortality of respiratory diseases. However, few evidence was available 
on the effect of exposure to ambient PM2.5 on the years of life lost (YLL) from 
respiratory diseases in the elderly. Furthermore, birth season which is 
frequently applied as a proxy for environmental exposure in early life may 
influence the health outcome in the later life. Nevertheless, the modification 
effect of birth season on the relationship of PM2.5 exposure and respiratory 
health need to be explored.
METHODS: A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyze YLL from 
respiratory diseases in the elderly related to ambient PM2.5 exposure between 
2013 and 2016 in Ningbo, China. The modification effect of birth season was 
explored by subgroup comparisons between different birth seasons.
RESULTS: Each 10 μg/m3 increase in daily ambient PM2.5 was associated with an 
increment of 1.61 (95% CI 0.12, 3.10) years in YLL from respiratory diseases in 
the elderly population. Individuals who were born in winter had significantly 
higher YLL from respiratory diseases associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure than 
those who were born in other seasons.
CONCLUSIONS: Birth season which reflects the early-life PM2.5 exposure level 
that may influence the lung development has a potential effect on the disease 
burden of respiratory diseases related to ambient PM2.5 exposure in later life. 
The results would provide theoretical basis to protect vulnerable population 
defined by birth season when exploring the adverse effects of ambient PM2.5 in 
the respiratory health.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness evaluation comparing the management 
options for mid-size (1-2cm) renal stones including percutaneous nephrolithotomy 
(PCNL), retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), and shockwave lithotripsy (SWL).
METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare cost-effectiveness of PCNL, 
mini-PCNL, RIRS, and SWL for 1-2cm lower pole (index patient 1) and PCNL, RIRS, 
and SWL for 1-2 cm non-lower pole (index patient 2) renal stones. A literature 
review provided stone free, complication, retreatment, secondary procedure 
rates, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Medicare costs were used. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared with a 
willingness-to-pay(WTP) threshold of $100,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: At 3 years, costs for index patient 1 were $10,290(PCNL), 
$10,109(mini-PCNL), $5,930(RIRS), and $10,916(SWL). Mini-PCNL resulted in the 
highest QALYs(2.953) followed by PCNL(2.951), RIRS(2.946), and SWL(2.943). This 
translated to RIRS being most cost-effective followed by mini-PCNL(ICER 
$624,075/QALY) and PCNL(ICER $946,464/QALY). SWL was dominated with higher costs 
and lower effectiveness. For index patient 2, RIRS dominated both PCNL and SWL. 
For index patient 1: mini-PCNL and PCNL became cost effective if cost ≤$5,940 
and ≤$5,390, respectively. SWL became cost-effective with SFR ≥75% or cost 
≤$1,236. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the most cost-effective strategy 
was RIRS in 97%, mini-PCNL in 2%, PCNL in 1%, and SWL in 0% of simulations.
CONCLUSION: For 1-2cm renal stones, RIRS is most cost-effective. However, mini 
and standard PCNL could become cost-effective at lower costs, particularly for 
lower pole stones.

Outpatient physical therapy population has been aging faster than the general 
population: a total population register-based study.

Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.

BACKGROUND: The Icelandic population is aging like other populations in the 
world, the life expectancy is high, and the national focus is to help people to 
age in their own homes. The objectives of this research was to describe 17 years 
of demographic changes among outpatient physical therapy (OPT) clients and to 
determine if these changes reflect aging in the total population.
METHODS: Data was obtained from a national registry with information on all OPT 
clients reimbursed by Icelandic Health Insurance from 1999 to 2015, and general 
population data from the Statistics Iceland registry covering the same 17 years. 
Simple counts, proportions, Rate Ratios (RR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) 
were used to describe and compare the two time-points (1999 and 2015) in both 
populations, and regression analyses were used to estimate linear changes for 
each of these 17 years.
RESULTS: Comparing the endpoints of the 17-year period, the proportion of older 
adults within the total OPT clientele increased by 23 % (from 18.3 % to 1999 to 
23.5 % in 2015; RR 1.23; 95 %CI 1.19-1.27).) while in the general Icelandic 
population, the proportion of older adults increased by 15 % (from 11.6 % to 
1999 to 13.5 % in 2015; RR 1.15; 95 % CI 1.1-1.21). For each of these 17 years, 
there was an overall 5 % yearly increase in the rate of older adults from the 
general older Icelandic population who used an OPT (accounting for population 
aging), and an overall 3.5 % yearly increase in the proportional contribution of 
older adults to the total OPT clientele. Adjusting for sex and older age group 
revealed that this increase in rate and proportion was most pronounced among 
≥ 85-year-old men.
CONCLUSIONS: This case of Iceland is an example of how health-related and 
population-based registers may potentially be used to routinely inform and 
facilitate optimal planning of future health care services for older adults.

BACKGROUND: To determine the rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesion 
and cancer (HSIL+) diagnosis as a result of colposcopic histopathology in 
patients aged ≥50 years and to investigate the role of cytology, Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) test positivity and HPV genotyping in predicting HSIL+.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 1102 patients aged ≥50 as study group 
and 2723 patients aged <50 as control group who were admitted to our colposcopy 
unit between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 and underwent colposcopy for 
the first time. The patients with HSIL+ were compared as Cytology group and HPV 
group in the study group. To evaluate the impact of genotyping HPV positive 
group was compared in terms of HSIL+ results in subgroups with HPV16/18 and HPV 
other types positivity. Patients diagnosed with cancer in the same period were 
compared in terms of age, stage and histology as screening cancer group and 
symptomatic cancer groups.
RESULTS: The rate of cervical cancer in the study group was 2.2% and 1.2 % in 
the control group. In patients diagnosed with cancer, Federation of Gynecology 
and Obstetrics stage was ≥ stage IB2 in 57.4% of cases in the symptomatic cancer 
group and in 18.9% of cases in the screening cancer group. The HPV 16/18 
positivity rate in HSIL+ patients were 75.0% and 79.5% in the study and control 
group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer rates were found to be high in the group aged ≥ 50 
years. HPV genotyping is as effective in patients ≥50 years of age as in those 
aged < 50 years. Patients diagnosed as a result of screening are caught in the 
early stages and therefore with increased general life expectancy, the age at 
which screening is discontinued should be re-evaluated.

The aim of this study was to determine age-related changes and sex-specific 
differences in sagittal alignment, range of motion (ROM), and intervertebral 
disc height of the thoracolumbar spine in healthy subjects. Lateral neutral and 
flexion-extension radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine of 627 asymptomatic 
subjects (307 males and 320 females; average age, 49.6 ± 16.5 years) were 
evaluated. We included at least 50 males and 50 females in each decade of life 
between the 20s and the 70s. Intervertebral disc height from T10/T11 to L5/S1, 
local lordotic alignment, and ROM from T10-T11 to L5-S1 were measured. T10-L2 
kyphosis and T12-S1 lordosis as well as flexion, extension, and total ROM were 
measured. T10-L2 kyphosis did not markedly change with age in subjects of either 
sex but a sudden increase was noted in the 70s females. T12-S1 lordosis 
increased with age in both sexes, except the 70s. Flexion, extension, and total 
ROM at T10-L2 and T12-S1 decreased with age in most subjects. The levels from 
L3-L4 to L5-S1 were conspicuous as mobile segments. Intervertebral disc height 
gradually increased from T10/T11 to L4/L5; the shortest was at T10/T11 and the 
longest at L3/L4 or L4/L5 in all subjects. Age-related decreases in 
intervertebral disc height were most prominent at L4/L5 in middle-aged and 
elderly individuals of both sexes. Normative values of sagittal alignment, ROM, 
and intervertebral disc height at each segmental level were established in both 
sexes and all age groups in healthy subjects.

OBJECTIVE: Medical progress in cancer care has led to increased life expectancy 
outcomes across all stages of cancer, including in advanced cancers. People now 
living with advanced chronic cancers have unique, ongoing functional and 
quality-of-life needs. This article explores the functional considerations of 
individuals living with advanced chronic cancers in terms of managing chronic 
palliative care needs, assessing and intervening for functional issues, and 
consistently using occupational therapy in shared service provision together 
with medical and nursing teams. The unique and changing functional needs of 
these individuals may be effectively addressed through consideration of chronic 
palliative approaches to care; earlier access to occupational therapy services 
to facilitate continued engagement in everyday activities; and shared service 
provision with nursing to address both medical wellness and functional status.
DATA SOURCES: These include key databases (Pubmed, CINAHL), international 
guidelines, and professional guidance documents.
CONCLUSION: Individuals living with advanced chronic cancer have ongoing and 
fluctuating functional needs that should be addressed in palliative care service 
provision. The inclusion of occupational therapy as part of inter- and 
multidisciplinary teams can facilitate maximization of function for individuals 
living with advanced chronic cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Timely early referrals to occupational 
therapy can address functional issues as they arise, and can prepare individuals 
for future functional considerations.

Arabia.

This study explores the impact of remote emergency learning during the COVID-19 
pandemic on students' perception and acceptance of blended learning after the 
pandemic. The study applies the Community of Inquiry framework to understand the 
predictors and whether there is any statically significant correlation between 
the experience of remote teaching and students' perception and acceptance of the 
blended learning mode in the future as a stage in the gradual return to normal 
life after the pandemic. In addition to examining the correlation between 
students' perception of cognitive, teaching and social presences on their 
perception of blended learning, the correlation between technological and 
financial factors as well as demographic data on the intention to enrol in 
blended learning in the future is examined. The study surveyed one hundred and 
fifteen students from female Saudi Universities who are enrolled in a design 
major. The results revealed that the teaching, cognitive and social presences 
constructs are predictors of students' perception and acceptance of blended 
learning. Further, the facilitating conditions and efforts expectancy are also 
predictors of the perception of blended learning. The study also found that 
there is a significant correlation between the CoI and the selected constructs 
from the UTAUT when it comes to studying students' perception of blended 
learning.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted 
memory, learning functions, reduced life expectancy, and locomotor dysfunction, 
as a result of the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid peptides that cause 
neuronal damage in neuronal circuits. In the current study, we exploited a 
transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line, expressing amyloid-β peptides to 
investigate the efficacy of a newly synthesized acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 
named XJP-1, as a potential AD therapy. Behavioral assays and confocal 
microscopy were used to characterize the drug effect on AD symptomatology and 
amyloid peptide deposition. The symptomatology induced in this particular 
transgenic model recapitulates the scenario observed in human AD patients, 
showing a shortened lifespan and reduced locomotor functions, along with a 
significant accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. XJP-1 treatment 
resulted in a significant improvement of AD symptoms and a reduction of amyloid 
plaques by diminishing the amyloid aggregation rate. In comparison with 
clinically effective AD drugs, our results demonstrated that XJP-1 has similar 
effects on AD symptomatology, but at 10 times lower drug concentration than 
donepezil. It also showed an earlier beneficial effect on the reduction of 
amyloid plaques at 10 days after drug treatment, as observed for donepezil at 20 
days, while the other drugs tested have no such effect. As a novel and potent 
AChE inhibitor, our study demonstrates that inhibition of the enzyme AChE by 
XJP-1 treatment improves the amyloid-induced symptomatology in Drosophila, by 
reducing the number of amyloid plaques within the fruit fly CNS. Thus, compound 
XJP-1 has the therapeutic potential to be further investigated for the treatment 
of AD.

BACKGROUND: The association between adiposity and papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC) has been reported in several studies, but its association with aggressive 
clinicopathologic features is not well-recognized. Our aim is to systematically 
review the literature to identify whether adiposity, expressed through Body Mass 
Index (BMI), is related to aggressive clinicopathologic features such as 
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymph node 
(LN) metastasis and multifocality in patients with PTC.
METHODS: A systematic search for articles was performed using the PubMed, EBSCO, 
and Cochrane Library for all articles published in English until December 2020. 
Specific keywords such as "papillary thyroid carcinoma", "Body Mass Index", 
"clinicopathologic features" were used in the search strategy. Two independent 
reviewers screened all retrieved articles based on predefined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was performed in the studies that reported 
crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). The methodological quality was assessed 
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 11 retrospective cohort studies involving 26,196 
participants included. Our findings showed that elevated BMI was significantly 
associated with ETE in both overweight (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.09-1.44) and obesity 
group (OR 1.45, 95% CI:1.26-1.64). Elevated BMI was also significantly 
associated with multifocality in overweight patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI:1.10-1.24) 
and obese patients (OR 1.45, 95% CI:1.29-1.62). Also, obesity was significantly 
associated with increased tumor size (OR 1.77, 95% CI:1.52-2.03) and with LN 
metastasis (OR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.12-1.44), whereas being overweight was 
significantly associated with advanced TNM stage (OR 1.55, 95% CI:1.27-1.83).
CONCLUSION: Our results provide strong evidence for the association between 
higher BMI and ETE, multifocality, and tumor size. Further studies with a larger 
number of participants are required to elucidate further the association of 
increased BMI with advanced TNM stage and LN metastasis.

Antibody Conjugates for Targeted Therapy Against HIV-1 as an Emerging Tool for 
HIV-1 Cure.

Institute, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Although advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have significantly improved 
the life expectancy of people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) by suppressing HIV-1 
replication, a cure for HIV/AIDS remains elusive. Recent findings of the 
emergence of drug resistance against various ART have resulted in an increased 
number of treatment failures, thus the development of novel strategies for HIV-1 
cure is of immediate need. Antibody-based therapy is a well-established tool in 
the treatment of various diseases and the engineering of new antibody 
derivatives is expanding the realms of its application. An antibody-based 
carrier of anti-HIV-1 molecules, or antibody conjugates (ACs), could address the 
limitations of current HIV-1 ART by decreasing possible off-target effects, 
reduce toxicity, increasing the therapeutic index, and lowering production 
costs. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with exceptional breadth and 
potency against HIV-1 are currently being explored to prevent or treat HIV-1 
infection in the clinic. Moreover, bNAbs can be engineered to deliver cytotoxic 
or immune regulating molecules as ACs, further increasing its therapeutic 
potential for HIV-1 cure. ACs are currently an important component of anticancer 
treatment with several FDA-approved constructs, however, to date, no ACs are 
approved to treat viral infections. This review aims to outline the development 
of AC for HIV-1 cure, examine the variety of carriers and payloads used, and 
discuss the potential of ACs in the current HIV-1 cure landscape.

The value of survival gains from therapeutic innovations for US patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

AIMS: This study quantifies the value of survival gains attributable to novel 
treatments approved since 2003 for United States (US) patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
METHODS: We estimated the increase in survival attributable to lenalidomide and 
bortezomib for multiple myeloma (MM) patients in the 1983-2013 Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. To estimate the survival benefit 
of treatments approved since 2015 (carfilzomib, elotuzomab, daratumumab, used in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone) we used clinical trial data to 
calibrate survival estimated using the SEER data. We then conducted an economic 
valuation of the estimated shift in survival curves for all therapies. Finally, 
we estimated the share of the value accruing to patients and manufacturers using 
treatment costs estimated from MarketScan data.
RESULTS: The introduction of bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone (Vd) 
and lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone (Rd) resulted in substantial 
survival gains and societal value for multiple myeloma patients, generating 1.7 
additional life-years per RRMM patient. More recently, approved novel treatments 
have improved survival over effective treatments (i.e. Rd/Vd) by an additional 
2.5 life-years - the monetary value of this incremental survival benefit far 
exceeds the incremental cost of treatment. At the patient level, the incremental 
benefit of Rd/Vd is $335,500 and with novel treatments is $565,000. Applying 
this benefit to all future cohorts of US RRMM patients translates into a value 
of at least $75 billion and $130 billion with Rd/Vd and the novel treatments, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: SEER registry data were only available through 2013. Therefore, 
survival gains for recently approved treatments were estimated based on clinical 
trials, rather than observed survival. Our valuation analysis does not capture 
sources of value aside from survival gains, for example, better quality of life, 
increased productivity, or the value of surviving until subsequent novel 
therapies become available. Substantial extensions in life expectancy in RRMM 
since 2003 translate into real economic value gained by society.

Acute Aortic Dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening condition, which 
presents with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from being asymptomatic to 
sudden cardiac death. A retrograde extension of AAD can lead to partial or 
complete occlusion of coronary vessels, leading to an exceedingly rare 
presentation in the form of acute Myocardial Infarction (MI). A prognosis of AAD 
depends on prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention to re-establish 
coronary blood flow. Here, we report a case of AAD, presenting as acute 
anterolateral wall MI, due to total occlusion of the left main coronary artery.

Introduction: Local health departments are currently limited in their ability to 
use life expectancy (LE) as a benchmark for improving community health. In 
collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, our aim was to develop 
a web-based tool to estimate the potential lives saved and gains in LE in 
specific neighborhoods following interventions targeting achievable reductions 
in preventable deaths. Methods: The PROLONGER (ImPROved LONGEvity through 
Reductions in Cause-Specific Deaths) tool utilizes a novel Lives Saved 
Simulation model to estimate neighborhood-level potential change in LE after 
specified reduction in cause-specific mortality. This analysis uses 2012-2016 
deaths in Baltimore City residents; a 20% reduction in heart disease mortality 
is shown as a case study. Results: According to PROLONGER, if heart disease 
deaths could be reduced by 20% in a given neighborhood in Baltimore City, there 
could be up to a 2.3-year increase in neighborhood LE. The neighborhoods with 
highest expected LE increase are not the same as those with highest heart 
disease mortality burden or lowest overall life expectancies. Discussion: 
PROLONGER is a practical resource for local health officials in prioritizing 
scarce resources to improve health outcomes. Focusing programs based on 
potential LE impact at the neighborhood level could lend new information for 
targeting of place-based public health interventions.
