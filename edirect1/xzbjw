are being performed in the world. Life sciences data generated by new 
technologies are continuing to grow in not only size but also variety and 
complexity, with great speed. To ensure that big data has a major influence in 
the life sciences, comprehensive data analysis across multiple data sources and 
even across disciplines is indispensable. The increasing volume of data and the 
heterogeneous, complex varieties of data are two principal issues mainly 
discussed in life science informatics. The ever-evolving next-generation Web, 
characterized as the Semantic Web, is an extension of the current Web, aiming to 
provide information for not only humans but also computers to semantically 
process large-scale data. The paper presents a survey of big data in life 
sciences, big data related projects and Semantic Web technologies. The paper 
introduces the main Semantic Web technologies and their current situation, and 
provides a detailed analysis of how Semantic Web technologies address the 
heterogeneous variety of life sciences big data. The paper helps to understand 
the role of Semantic Web technologies in the big data era and how they provide a 
promising solution for the big data in life sciences.

There are few certainties in life-death is one of them. Yet death is often 
thought of today as the 'loss of the battle' against illness, where in 
traditional societies it was the natural, meaningful, end to life. Medical 
knowledge and technologies have extended the possibilities of medical care and 
increased our life span. People living in most developed countries today can 
expect to survive to an advanced age and die in hospital rather than at home as 
in the past. Owing to these and other historical, cultural and social factors, 
our views on death have been skewed. Medical technology provides an arsenal of 
weapons to launch against death and the 'war against disease' has entrenched 
itself in medical philosophy. We now primarily experience death through the lens 
of a camera. Representations of 'death as spectacle' distort our perceptions and 
leave us ill-prepared for the reality. Additionally, death as a natural 
consequence of life has become much less visible than it was in the past due to 
our longer life expectancies and lack of infectious disease. The continued 
thrust for treatment, wedded with a failure to recognise the dying process, can 
rob individuals of a peaceful, dignified death. Progress being made in Advance 
Care Planning and palliative care is limited by the existing paradigm of death 
as a 'foe to be conquered'. It is time for a shift in this paradigm.

BACKGROUND: Point-of-care CD4 tests at HIV diagnosis could improve linkage to 
care in resource-limited settings. Our objective is to evaluate the clinical and 
economic impact of point-of-care CD4 tests compared to laboratory-based tests in 
Mozambique.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use a validated model of HIV testing, linkage, and 
treatment (CEPAC-International) to examine two strategies of immunological 
staging in Mozambique: (1) laboratory-based CD4 testing (LAB-CD4) and (2) 
point-of-care CD4 testing (POC-CD4). Model outcomes include 5-y survival, life 
expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). 
Input parameters include linkage to care (LAB-CD4, 34%; POC-CD4, 61%), 
probability of correctly detecting antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility 
(sensitivity: LAB-CD4, 100%; POC-CD4, 90%) or ART ineligibility (specificity: 
LAB-CD4, 100%; POC-CD4, 85%), and test cost (LAB-CD4, US$10; POC-CD4, US$24). In 
sensitivity analyses, we vary POC-CD4-specific parameters, as well as cohort and 
setting parameters to reflect a range of scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa. We 
consider ICERs less than three times the per capita gross domestic product in 
Mozambique (US$570) to be cost-effective, and ICERs less than one times the per 
capita gross domestic product in Mozambique to be very cost-effective. Projected 
5-y survival in HIV-infected persons with LAB-CD4 is 60.9% (95% CI, 
60.9%-61.0%), increasing to 65.0% (95% CI, 64.9%-65.1%) with POC-CD4. Discounted 
life expectancy and per person lifetime costs with LAB-CD4 are 9.6 y (95% CI, 
9.6-9.6 y) and US$2,440 (95% CI, US$2,440-US$2,450) and increase with POC-CD4 to 
10.3 y (95% CI, 10.3-10.3 y) and US$2,800 (95% CI, US$2,790-US$2,800); the ICER 
of POC-CD4 compared to LAB-CD4 is US$500/year of life saved (YLS) (95% CI, 
US$480-US$520/YLS). POC-CD4 improves clinical outcomes and remains near the very 
cost-effective threshold in sensitivity analyses, even if point-of-care CD4 
tests have lower sensitivity/specificity and higher cost than published values. 
In other resource-limited settings with fewer opportunities to access care, 
POC-CD4 has a greater impact on clinical outcomes and remains cost-effective 
compared to LAB-CD4. Limitations of the analysis include the uncertainty around 
input parameters, which is examined in sensitivity analyses. The potential added 
benefits due to decreased transmission are excluded; their inclusion would 
likely further increase the value of POC-CD4 compared to LAB-CD4.
CONCLUSIONS: POC-CD4 at the time of HIV diagnosis could improve survival and be 
cost-effective compared to LAB-CD4 in Mozambique, if it improves linkage to 
care. POC-CD4 could have the greatest impact on mortality in settings where 
resources for HIV testing and linkage are most limited. Please see later in the 
article for the Editors' Summary.

Insects modify their responses to stimuli through experience of associating 
those stimuli with events important for survival (e.g., food, mates, threats). 
There are several behavioral mechanisms through which an insect learns salient 
associations and relates them to these events. It is important to understand 
this behavioral plasticity for programs aimed toward assisting insects that are 
beneficial for agriculture. This understanding can also be used for discovering 
solutions to biomedical and agricultural problems created by insects that act as 
disease vectors and pests. The Proboscis Extension Response (PER) conditioning 
protocol was developed for honey bees (Apis mellifera) over 50 years ago to 
study how they perceive and learn about floral odors, which signal the nectar 
and pollen resources a colony needs for survival. The PER procedure provides a 
robust and easy-to-employ framework for studying several different ecologically 
relevant mechanisms of behavioral plasticity. It is easily adaptable for use 
with several other insect species and other behavioral reflexes. These protocols 
can be readily employed in conjunction with various means for monitoring neural 
activity in the CNS via electrophysiology or bioimaging, or for manipulating 
targeted neuromodulatory pathways. It is a robust assay for rapidly detecting 
sub-lethal effects on behavior caused by environmental stressors, toxins or 
pesticides. We show how the PER protocol is straightforward to implement using 
two procedures. One is suitable as a laboratory exercise for students or for 
quick assays of the effect of an experimental treatment. The other provides more 
thorough control of variables, which is important for studies of behavioral 
conditioning. We show how several measures for the behavioral response ranging 
from binary yes/no to more continuous variable like latency and duration of 
proboscis extension can be used to test hypotheses. And, we discuss some 
pitfalls that researchers commonly encounter when they use the procedure for the 
first time.

Evaluation and treatment of older patients with hypercholesterolemia: a clinical 
review.

Occupational Health, Lappeenranta, Finland.

IMPORTANCE: Hypercholesterolemia is common among people older than 80 years. 
Substantial functional heterogeneity exists among older patients, and decision 
making for statin use differs in older patients relative to younger ones.
OBJECTIVE: To discuss the presentation, modifying factors, and treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia (usually with statins) among persons older than 80 years.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE and other sources were searched from January 1990 to 
June 2014. Personal libraries and a hand search of reference lists from 
guidelines and reviews from January 2000 to June 2014 were also used.
FINDINGS: No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of statin or any other 
hypocholesterolemic medication included persons older than 80 years at baseline. 
Findings from 75- to 80-year-old patients enrolled in RCTs and information from 
observational studies support statin treatment for secondary prevention of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and probably in patients with 
diabetes without ASCVD. Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older 
patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because 
people older than 80 years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life 
expectancy, may have frailty or comorbid conditions, and may take multiple 
medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ideally, treatment of hypercholesterolemia for 
patients at risk of ASCVD should start before they turn 80 years old. No RCT 
evidence exists to guide statin initiation after age 80 years. Decisions to use 
statins in older individuals are made individually and are not supported by 
high-quality evidence.

BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage occlusion devices are cost effective for 
stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation when compared with dabigatran or 
warfarin. We illustrate the use of value-of-information analyses to quantify the 
degree and consequences of decisional uncertainty and to identify future 
research priorities.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A microsimulation decision-analytic model compared left 
atrial appendage occlusion devices to dabigatran or warfarin in atrial 
fibrillation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis quantified the degree of 
parameter uncertainty. Expected value of perfect information analyses showed the 
consequences of this uncertainty. Expected value of partial perfect information 
analyses were done on sets of input parameters (cost, utilities, and 
probabilities) to identify the source of the greatest uncertainty. One-way 
sensitivity analyses identified individual parameters for expected value of 
partial perfect information analyses. Population expected value of perfect 
information and expected value of partial perfect information provided an upper 
bound on the cost of future research. Substantial uncertainty was identified, 
with left atrial appendage occlusion devices being preferred in only 47% of 
simulations. The expected value of perfect information was $8542 per patient and 
$227.3 million at a population level. The expected value of partial perfect 
information for the set of probability parameters represented the most important 
source of uncertainty, at $6875. Identified in 1-way sensitivity analyses, the 
expected value of partial perfect information for the odds ratio for stroke with 
left atrial appendage occlusion compared with warfarin was calculated at $7312 
per patient or $194.5 million at a population level.
CONCLUSION: The relative efficacy of stroke reduction with left atrial appendage 
occlusion devices in relation to warfarin is an important source of uncertainty. 
Improving estimates of this parameter should be the priority for future research 
in this area.

Addressing the value of novel therapies in chemotherapy-induced nausea and 
vomiting.

Schwartzberg L(1).

Author information:
(1)The West Clinic, 100 North Humphreys Boulevard, Memphis, TN 38120-2146, USA.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a troubling side effect of 
cancer treatment and is often poorly controlled. As a consequence, CINV is 
associated with substantially increased costs of care and significant 
interference with patients' lives. Inadequate control over CINV results from 
factors that include failure to provide guideline-adherent prophylactic 
medication and limitations in available therapies. Newer serotonin receptor 
antagonists, such as palonosetron, and addition of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor 
antagonists to treatment have significantly decreased both acute and delayed 
CINV. A fixed-dose combination of palonosetron and a new NK-1 receptor, 
netupitant, is significantly superior to palonosetron alone and has small, but 
consistent, numerical advantages over aprepitant plus palonosetron for 
prevention of CINV. The combination of a serotonin receptor antagonist plus an 
NK-1 receptor antagonist has been shown to be cost-effective for prevention of 
CINV and the availability of a fixed-dose combination of netupitant and 
palonosetron may enhance this benefit.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor versus 
clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in the Platelet 
Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) study who were scheduled for 
non-invasive management.
METHODS: A previously developed cost effectiveness model was used to estimate 
long-term costs and outcomes for patients scheduled for non-invasive management. 
Healthcare costs, event rates and health-related quality of life under treatment 
with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel over 12 months were estimated from the 
PLATO study. Long-term costs and health outcomes were estimated based on data 
from PLATO and published literature sources. To investigate the importance of 
different healthcare cost structures and life expectancy for the results, the 
analysis was carried out from the perspectives of the Swedish, UK, German and 
Brazilian public healthcare systems.
RESULTS: Ticagrelor was associated with lifetime quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gains of 0.17 in Sweden, 0.16 in the UK, 0.17 in Germany and 0.13 in 
Brazil compared with generic clopidogrel, with increased healthcare costs of 
€467, €551, €739 and €574, respectively. The cost per QALY gained with 
ticagrelor was €2747, €3395, €4419 and €4471 from a Swedish, UK, German and 
Brazilian public healthcare system perspective, respectively. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost per QALY gained with ticagrelor was 
below conventional threshold values of cost effectiveness with a high 
probability.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with ACS scheduled for 12 months' 
non-invasive management with ticagrelor is associated with a cost per QALY 
gained below conventional threshold values of cost effectiveness compared with 
generic clopidogrel.

DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification regulating gene expression 
and chromatin structure in many eukaryotes. Plants have a unique DNA 
demethylation system in that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is directly removed by DNA 
demethylases, such as DME/ROS1 family proteins, but little is known about the 
downstream events. During 5mC excision, DME produces 3'-phosphor-α, 
β-unsaturated aldehyde and 3'-phosphate by successive β- and δ-eliminations, 
respectively. The kinetic studies revealed that these 3'-blocking lesions 
persist for a significant amount of time and at least two different enzyme 
activities are required to immediately process them. We demonstrate that 
Arabidopsis AP endonucleases APE1L, APE2 and ARP have distinct functions to 
process such harmful lesions to allow nucleotide extension. DME expression is 
toxic to E. coli due to excessive 5mC excision, but expression of APE1L or ARP 
significantly reduces DME-induced cytotoxicity. Finally, we propose a model of 
base excision repair and DNA demethylation pathway unique to plants.

Hospital, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Whether patients with small (<2 cm), sporadic nonfunctioning 
pancreatic endocrine tumors (NF-PETs) should directly undergo pancreatic surgery 
or should be followed longitudinally to detect growth and malignancy still has 
to be defined.
STUDY DESIGN: Based on the pertinent literature of the past decade, a Markov 
model was developed to investigate this issue. In the wait-and-see strategy arm, 
surgery was performed if the tumor attained a size ≥2 cm or surpassed 20% of the 
initial size. In a Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis, 100 hypothetical patients 
undergoing a wait-and-see strategy were compared to 100 patients directly 
undergoing surgery, with the aim of investigating the efficacy and 
cost-effectiveness of the two strategies.
RESULTS: During the postdiagnostic lifetime, 63 NF-PETs in the wait-and-see 
group showed significant growth and underwent surgery: 38 were stage I, 10 were 
stage II, 15 were stage III and none were stage IV. In the base-case scenario, 
the mean life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy were found to be 
superior after immediate surgery [26.1 years and 11.8 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs)] than with the wait-and-see strategy (22.1 years and 8.3 QALYs) as 
the consequence of ageing during the wait-and-see follow-up which increased 
mortality due to surgery, when surgery was needed. The model was sensitive to 
starting age and length of follow-up; in particular, for patients >65 years of 
age, the two strategies provided similar results but the wait-and-see strategy 
was more cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The wait-and-see strategy for NF-PETs <2 cm represents a reasonable 
approach in patients over 65 years of age; otherwise, immediate surgery is 
preferable.

Previously, we have shown that Onecut1 (Oc1) and Onecut2 (Oc2) are expressed in 
retinal progenitor cells, developing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and 
horizontal cells (HCs). However, in Oc1-null mice, we only observed an 80% 
reduction in HCs, but no defects in other cell types. We postulated that the 
lack of defects in other cell types in Oc1-null retinas was a result of 
redundancy with Oc2. To test this theory, we have generated Oc2-null mice and 
now show that their retinas also only have defects in HCs, with a 50% reduction 
in their numbers. However, when both Oc1 and Oc2 are knocked out, the retinas 
exhibit more profound defects in the development of all early retinal cell 
types, including completely failed genesis of HCs, compromised generation of 
cones, reduced production (by 30%) of RGCs, and absence of starburst amacrine 
cells. Cone subtype diversification and RGC subtype composition also were 
affected in the double-null retina. Using RNA-Seq expression profiling, we have 
identified downstream genes of Oc1 and Oc2, which not only confirms the 
redundancy between the two factors and renders a molecular explanation for the 
defects in the double-null retinas, but also shows that the onecut factors 
suppress the production of the late cell type, rods, indicating that the two 
factors contribute to the competence of retinal progenitor cells for the early 
retinal cell fates. Our results provide insight into how onecut factors regulate 
the creation of cellular diversity in the retina and, by extension, in the 
central nervous system in general.

Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is found in milimolar concentrations in 
mammalian tissues. One of its main functions is osmoregulation; however, it also 
exhibits cytoprotective activity by diminishing injury caused by stress and 
disease. Taurine depletion is associated with several defects, many of which are 
found in the aging animal, suggesting that taurine might exert anti-aging 
actions. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the hypothesis that 
taurine depletion accelerates aging by reducing longevity and accelerating 
aging-associated tissue damage. Tissue taurine depletion in taurine transporter 
knockout (TauTKO) mouse was found to shorten lifespan and accelerate skeletal 
muscle histological and functional defects, including an increase in central 
nuclei containing myotubes, a reduction in mitochondrial complex 1 activity and 
an induction in an aging biomarker, Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor A 
(p16INK4a). Tissue taurine depletion also enhances unfolded protein response 
(UPR), which may be associated with an improvement in protein folding by 
taurine. Our data reveal that tissue taurine depletion affects longevity and 
cellular senescence; an effect possibly linked to a disturbance in protein 
folding.

In France, there is an important interregional disparity concerning 
participation to cancer screening programs. The aim of this study was to assess 
oncologic screening practices in Loire, a French rural department, in women and 
in the elderly (over age 74 years). For this, two surveys were conducted. The 
first one was regarding screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer in 
women over age 18 years living in Loire. The second survey was regarding 
onco-geriatric screening through two questionnaires : one for the elderly and 
the other for general practitioner (GP) of the department, evaluating screening 
for breast, colorectal, prostate, cervical and lung cancer. One hundred sixty 
six women were included in the first investigation mean age of 47.6 years. 
Ninety three point six per cent were screening for breast cancer, 19% received 
Human Papilloma virus vaccine, 83.1% were screening by Papanicolau smear for 
cervical cancer and finally, 51.7% were screening for colorectal cancer, among 
the one entering screening program criteria. In the second survey, 44 patients 
and 28 GP were included. Thirty-eight point six per cent of patients over 74 
years continue screening. Only 11.4% were reluctant to screening and in 80% 
because of anxiety du to the results. Among GP, 50 % continued screening on two 
major criteria : life expectancy and performans status. The present study shows 
heterogeneity of screening in this department both rural and working class and 
gives us a societo-medical photography.

Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple food in Africa. However, maize production is 
severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and 
Southern Africa, Chilo partellus is one of the most damaging cereal stem borers 
mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized 
that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected 
greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population 
growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory 
conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 °C), 
relative humidity of 75±5% and a photoperiod of L12:L12 h. Several non-linear 
models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and 
reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation 
approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure 
populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest 
risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and 
activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component 
of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the 
future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A1B 
obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with 
available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results 
show that the development times of the different stages decreased with 
increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 °C; at the extreme temperatures, 
15 and 38 °C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development. The study 
concludes that C. partellus may potentially expands its range into higher 
altitude areas, highland tropics and moist transitional regions, with the 
highest maize potential where the species has not been recorded yet. This has 
serious implication in terms of food security since these areas produce 
approximately 80% of the total maize in East Africa.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of annual colonoscopy for detection of 
colorectal neoplasia among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is uncertain. The aim of this study was to 
determine whether annual colonoscopy among patients with IBD-PSC is 
cost-effective compared with less frequent intervals from the perspective of a 
publicly funded health care system.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model was used to simulate a 
35-year-old patient with a 10-year history of well-controlled IBD and a recent 
diagnosis of concomitant PSC. The following strategies were compared: no 
surveillance, colonoscopy every 5 years, biennial colonoscopy, and annual 
colonoscopy. Outcome measures included: costs, number of cases of dysplasia 
found, number of cancers found and missed, deaths, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, no surveillance was the least expensive and 
least effective strategy. Compared with no surveillance, the cost per QALY of 
surveillance every 5 years was CAD $15,021. The cost per QALY of biennial 
surveillance compared with surveillance every 5 years was CAD $37,522. Annual 
surveillance was more effective than biennial surveillance, but at an 
incremental cost of CAD $174,650 per QALY gained compared with biennial 
surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: More frequent colonoscopy screening intervals improve effectiveness 
(i.e., detects more cancers and prevents additional deaths), but at higher cost. 
Health systems must consider the opportunity costs associated with different 
surveillance colonoscopy intervals when deciding which strategy to implement 
among patients with IBD-PSC.

Crossbreeding of indigenous tropical and improved western dairy cattle breeds as 
tool to improve dairy cattle performance on smallholder farms has been widely 
advocated, criticised and yet applied. The government of Ethiopia supported this 
technology for decades but adoption rate is low. Constraints are documented but 
there is little information about farm level introduction and development of 
crossbreeding. A total 122 smallholders with mixed crop livestock farms and at 
least 8 years of successful crossbreeding were interviewed using a pre-tested 
questionnaire in two contexts in Amhara Regional state in north-western 
Ethiopia. Crossbreeding initiator was either uncoordinated government extension 
or a coordinated development project, also implemented with governmental 
support. Qualitative and quantitative data on farmers' motivations, 
crossbreeding introduction, initiator support, breeding adaptation and impacts 
at farm level were analysed. Results show that even though motives vary between 
contexts the underlying reason to introduce crossbreeding was economic profit. 
To be able to introduce crossbreeding support of initiators (e.g. extension) and 
other farmers was essential. The crossbreeding introduction context had some 
influence. Governmental actors were the main source of support and supplier of 
exotic genetics but the farmer network acted as safety net filling gaps of 
government support. Breeding strategies focused on performance increase. A lack 
of basic understanding of crossbreeding has been identified. A surprising, 
probably biased, result was general satisfaction with initiator support and with 
breeding services. It was challenged by the high proportion of farmers unable to 
follow a breeding strategy due to insufficient bull and/or semen supply. 
Crossbreeding changed the smallholder production system to a high input - high 
output system. Except for crossbred adaptation problems, challenges were ranked 
context specific and influenced by the initiator. Farmers perceived 
crossbreeding as success and recommended it. We conclude that farmers can 
realize income increase with crossbreeding. The complexity of this technology, 
high initial investment and the need for support services and external 
production inputs are probable reasons why crossbreeding uptake is low. 
Improving the availability of semen and/or bulls must be the top priority for 
breeding service providers to enable farmers to follow a breeding strategy and 
reach a suitable and sustainable herd performance. Access to investment capital, 
input supply, strong technical support and market linkages are crucial for 
successful crossbreeding.

Decree No. 2012-1116 of 2 October 2012 on medico-economic assignments of the 
French National Authority for Health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) 
significantly alters the conditions for accessing the health products market in 
France. This paper presents a theoretical framework for interpreting the results 
of the economic evaluation of health technologies and summarises the facts 
available in France for developing benchmarks that will be used to interpret 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. This literature review shows that it is 
difficult to determine a threshold value but it is also difficult to interpret 
then incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) results without a threshold 
value. In this context, round table participants favour a pragmatic approach 
based on "benchmarks" as opposed to a threshold value, based on an 
interpretative and normative perspective, i.e. benchmarks that can change over 
time based on feedback.

Bariatric metabolic surgery.

Scopinaro N.

According to the WHO, the worldwide prevalence of obesity body mass index (BMI) 
30 kg/m² nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008, with 10% of men and 14% of women 
and a total of more than half a billion adults (aged >20 years old) being 
classed as obese. At least 2.8 million people die each year worldwide as a 
result of being overweight or obese, usually from the inevitable related 
comorbidities. It has been reported that approximately 65% of the worlds 
population inhabits countries where overweight and obesity are responsible for 
higher mortality than underweight. The recently published Interdisciplinary 
European Guidelines on Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery note that despite the WHO 
stating that excess weight is considered the fifth leading risk for deaths 
worldwide, it has not yet been possible to successfully curb the obesity 
epidemic. Moreover, severe obesity (BMI>35 kg/m²) represents a rapidly growing 
segment of the epidemic in which the negative effects on health and disability 
are especially marked. Excess weight drastically elevates a persons risk of 
developing a number of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, 
hypertension, stroke, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnoea, cancer, non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis, and other serious comorbidities. The WHO emphasises that 44% of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, 23% of ischaemic heart disease and around 741% of 
certain cancers are attributable to overweight and obesity. In the majority of 
European countries, overweight and obesity are responsible for about 80% of 
cases of type 2 diabetes, 35% of cases of ischaemic heart disease and 55% of 
cases of hypertensive disease among adults. Additionally, a range of 
debilitating conditions such as osteoarthritis, respiratory difficulties, 
gallbladder disease, infertility, and psychosocial problems, among others, which 
lead to reduced life expectancy, quality of life and disability, are extremely 
costly in terms of both absence from work and use of health resources. 
Noteworthy, the lifespan of severely obese individuals is decreased by an 
estimated 5-20 years depending on gender, age, and race. Weight loss and 
maintenance are the obvious aims of bariatric surgery. The ideal bariatric 
operation should be easy and quick to perform, with minimal perioperative and 
long-term complications. It should result in excellent weight loss and 
indefinite weight maintenance in the vast majority of operated patients, 
necessitating minimal follow-up care, and be equally suitable for all patients, 
independent of individual characteristics such as compliance, age, and different 
degrees of overweight. It is immediately apparent that such a surgical procedure 
does not exist, and therefore we must carefully evaluate all the different 
features and characteristics of each operation and of each patient to try to 
select the procedure that provides the greatest probability of long-term success 
for a particular patient, with the best cost/benefit ratio. Bariatric surgery 
has proven to be the most effective mode of treatment for morbidly obese 
patients, with recent long-term studies providing evidence of a substantial 
reduction of mortality in bariatric surgery patients, as well as a decreased 
risk of developing new health-related comorbidities. Furthermore, a reduction in 
the use of healthcare services and therefore a reduction in direct healthcare 
costs was also observed. Bariatric surgery is an established and integral part 
of the comprehensive management of morbidly obese patients.

[Simultaneous procedure in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal 
carcinoma].

[Article in Czech]

Třeška V, Hora M, Certík B, Moláček J, Houdek K, Náhlík J, Stránský P.

INTRODUCTION: Renal carcinoma (RC) is present in 0.1-3% of patients with 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). There are several options for surgical solution 
as regards the type and timing of the procedure. The authors discuss the 
simultaneous AAA resection and radical nephrectomy as a treatment option.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1168 patients with AAA including 19 (1.6%) with 
asymptomatic AAA (diameter >50mm) and RC (average diameter 74.3 mm) indicated 
for radical nephrectomy were operated on in the last 20 years (between 5/1994 
and 5/2014). The average age of the patients was 72.8 years (5585). 
Pre-operatively, sixteen patients were classified as ASA II, three as ASA III. 
Unilateral nephrectomy was performed in 18 and bilateral nephrectomy in one 
patient. One-stage AAA resection (1x endovascular aneurysm repair) with 
nephrectomy was performed in all patients.
RESULTS: Two patients with ASA III classification died within 30 days 
postoperatively due to acute myocardial infarction and multiorgan failure. In 
the other patients, the simultaneous procedure was without any complications. 
Four patients died within two years after the operation due to generalized RC, 
the others have survived in the interval of one and twelve years after the 
procedure.
CONCLUSION: Simultaneous procedure does not represent increased operation load 
for patients with good health status. Nevertheless, the type of procedure should 
be optimised for each individual patient with regard to his or her general 
health status, life expectancy, disease symptomatology, the diameter of the RC 
and the anatomical conditions of AAA.

Tetanus was a major cause of mortality in the free-ranging population of rhesus 
monkeys on Cayo Santiago prior to 1985 when the entire colony was given its 
first dose of tetanus toxoid. The immediate reduction in mortality that followed 
tetanus toxoid inoculation (TTI) has been documented, but the long-term 
demographic effects of eliminating tetanus infections have not. This study uses
