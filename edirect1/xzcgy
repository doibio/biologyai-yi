BACKGROUND: The majority of metastatic bone lesions to the femoral bone can be 
treated without surgery or with minimally invasive intramedullary nailing. In 
rare patients with extensive metastatic disease to the femur, total femur 
replacement may be the only surgical alternative to amputation; however, little 
is known about this approach.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In a highly selected small group of patients with metastatic 
carcinoma of the femur, we asked: (1) What was the patient survivorship after 
this treatment? (2) What was the implant survivorship free from all-cause 
revision and amputation, and what complications were associated with this 
treatment? (3) What functional outcomes were achieved by patients after total 
femur replacement for this indication?
METHODS: Eleven patients (three men, eight women) with a mean age of 64 years 
(range, 41-78 years) received total femur replacements between 1986 and 2016; 
none were lost to followup. The most common primary disease was breast cancer. 
In general, during this period, our indications for this procedure were 
extensive metastatic disease precluding internal fixation or isolated proximal 
or distal femur replacement, and an anticipated lifespan exceeding 6 months. Our 
contraindication for this procedure during this time was expected lifespan less 
than 6 months. Patient survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis; implant 
survival free from revision surgery and amputation were assessed by competing 
risk analysis. Function was determined preoperatively and 6 to 12 weeks 
postoperatively with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score normalized 
to a 100-point scale, with higher scores representing better function from a 
longitudinally maintained institutional database.
RESULTS: Eleven patients died at a median of 5 months (range, 1-31 months) after 
surgery. One-year revision-free and limb survival were 82% (95% CI, 51%-98%) and 
91% (95% CI, 61%-99%), respectively. Reasons for reoperation were hip 
dislocation, infection and local recurrence in one patient each. The latter two 
complications resulted in amputation in two patients. The median MSTS score was 
32 (range, 13-57).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite attempts to select patients who might have anticipated 
greater life expectancy, eight of 11 patients died by 6 months after surgery, 
and an additional two patients had undergone an amputation at 8 and at 17 months 
postoperatively. Most patients undergoing total femur replacement in this series 
did not recover from the procedure by the time they died, despite our best 
attempts to perform the procedure in patients whom we thought would live at 
least 6 months. Based on this, we believe that most patients with extensive 
metastatic disease to the femur should be offered palliative care, rather than 
major reconstruction.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the inclusion of trigger 
point-dry needling (TrP-DN) into an exercise program for the management of 
subacromial pain syndrome.
METHODS: Fifty patients with unilateral subacromial pain syndrome were 
randomized with concealed allocation to exercise alone or exercise plus TrP-DN. 
Both groups were asked to perform an exercise program targeting the rotator cuff 
musculature twice daily for five weeks. Patients allocated to the exercise plus 
TrP-DN group also received dry needling during the second and fourth sessions. 
Societal costs and health-related quality of life (estimated by EuroQol-5D-5L) 
over a one-year follow-up were used to generate incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ratios for each intervention.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis was possible for 48 (96%) of the 
participants. Those in the exercise group made more visits to medical doctors 
and received a greater number of other treatments (P < 0.001). The major 
contributor to societal costs (77%) was the absenteeism paid labor in favor of 
the exercise plus TrP-DN group (P = 0.03). The combination of exercise plus 
TrP-DN was less costly (mean difference cost/patient = €517.34, P = 0.003) than 
exercise alone. Incremental QALYs showed greater benefit for exercise plus 
TrP-DN (difference = 2.87, 95% confidence interval = 2.85-2.89). Therefore, the 
inclusion of TrP-DN into an exercise program was more likely to be 
cost-effective than an exercise program alone, with 99.5% of the iterations 
falling in the dominant area.
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of TrP-DN into an exercise program was more 
cost-effective for individuals with subacromial pain syndrome than exercise 
alone. From a cost-benefit perspective, the inclusion of TrP-DN into multimodal 
management of patients with subacromial pain syndrome should be considered.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a hereditary genomic instability disorder with a 
predisposition to leukemia and oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) facilitates cure of bone marrow 
failure and leukemia and thus extends life expectancy in FA patients; however, 
survival of hematologic malignancies increases the risk of OSCC in these 
patients. We developed a "cytology-on-a-chip" (COC)-based brush biopsy assay for 
monitoring patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Using 
this COC assay, we measured and correlated the cellular morphometry and 
Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2 (MCM2) expression levels in brush 
biopsy samples of FA patients' OPMD with clinical risk indicators such as loss 
of autofluorescence (LOF), HSCT status, and mutational profiles identified by 
next-generation sequencing. Statistically significant differences were found in 
several cytology measurements based on high-risk indicators such as LOF-positive 
and HSCT-positive status, including greater variation in cell area and chromatin 
distribution, higher MCM2 expression levels, and greater numbers of white blood 
cells and cells with enlarged nuclei. Higher OPMD risk scores were associated 
with differences in the frequency of nuclear aberrations and differed based on 
LOF and HSCT statuses. We identified mutation of FAT1 gene in five and NOTCH-2 
and TP53 genes in two cases of FA patients' OPMD. The high-risk OPMD of a non-FA 
patient harbored FAT1, CASP8, and TP63 mutations. Use of COC assay in 
combination with visualization of LOF holds promise for the early diagnosis of 
high-risk OPMD. These minimally invasive diagnostic tools are valuable for 
long-term surveillance of OSCC in FA patients and avoidance of unwarranted 
scalpel biopsies.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) reports that the risk of fatal 
occupational injuries in developing countries is almost twice as high as in 
developed countries, indicating a potential relationship between the fatality 
rates and the development level. The human development index (HDI), based on 
life expectancy, knowledge level and purchasing power parity, endorsed by the 
United Nations Development Programme, is a widely accepted measure of the 
development level. This study investigates the relationship between the HDI and 
the fatality rates reported by the ILO. A 23-country data set is used to 
demonstrate the general trend of the relationship followed by country-specific 
analyses for Australia, Spain, Hungary and Turkey. The study conducted is 
limited to fatal occupational injuries in construction, where the accidents are 
notoriously high. The results demonstrate a statistically significant inverse 
relationship between the fatality rates and the HDI.

BACKGROUND: Without explicit prognostic information, patients may overestimate 
their life expectancy and make poor choices at the end of life. We sought to 
design the Japanese version of an information aid (IA) to provide accurate 
information on prognosis to patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and to assess the effects of the IA on hope, psychosocial status, and 
perception of curability.
METHODS: We developed the Japanese version of an IA, which provided information 
on survival and cure rates as well as numerical survival estimates for patients 
with metastatic NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy. We then assessed the 
pre- and post-intervention effects of the IA on hope, anxiety, and perception of 
curability and treatment benefits.
RESULTS: A total of 20 (95%) of 21 patients (65% male; median age, 72 years) 
completed the IA pilot test. Based on the results, scores on the Distress and 
Impact Thermometer screening tool for adjustment disorders and major depression 
tended to decrease (from 4.5 to 2.5; P = 0.204), whereas no significant changes 
were seen in scores for anxiety on the Japanese version of the Support Team 
Assessment Schedule or in scores on the Hearth Hope Index (from 41.9 to 41.5; 
p = 0.204). The majority of the patients (16/20, 80%) had high expectations 
regarding the curative effects of chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The Japanese version of the IA appeared to help patients with NSCLC 
maintain hope, and did not increase their anxiety when they were given explicit 
prognostic information; however, the IA did not appear to help such patients 
understand the goal of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to test the 
findings in a larger sample and measure the outcomes of explicit prognostic 
information on hope, psychological status, and perception of curability.

Palliative radiotherapy has been shown to have effects on Quality of Life during 
painful bone metastasis. This review aimed to determine equivalence in pain 
relief (PR) and retreatment rate (RR) using both single and multi-fraction 
irradiations, based on evaluation of the trial's quality. We performed a 
systematic review since ICRU 50 Report (1993) to June 2017, then evaluated 
trials for reproducibility and good methodology criteria. We found five studies 
that were reproducible in both dose and volume prescription. One study used 
three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning. Equivalence between single and 
multi-fraction schedules was demonstrated for PR after 3 months, but a 2-3 time 
RR appeared after single-fraction schedules, notably in the first year after 
treatment (primarily during the first four months). Reserving long course 
therapy for well-preserved patients would allow for better long-term efficacy 
with lower RR, while altered patients would suffer less from single-fraction 
treatments. It appears that life expectancy might not be used as a criterion for 
this choice.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS), disability, mortality, and life expectancy (with and without disability) 
in a cohort of middle-aged American adults.
METHODS: The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a life-course study on 10,317 high 
school graduates from Wisconsin, was used to assess the odds ratio (OR) between 
EDS in 2004 for prevalent and incident disability to 2011 through multiple 
logistic regression, and to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of EDS in 2004 for 
mortality over ten years through a Cox proportional hazard model. We estimated 
age and sex-specific rates for mortality and disability from US nation-wide 
survey data in 2004. Combining these data with age-, sex- and EDS-specific 
mortality rates and disability prevalence estimated from our study, we 
constructed Sullivan life tables for those with and without EDS. Life expectancy 
(total, with, and without disability) from age 60 was estimated for those with 
and without EDS.
RESULTS: The study participants were on average 64 years old and 47% were men. 
Those with EDS were more likely to develop disability than those without (OR 
1.40, 95%CI 1.01-1.95). The HR for mortality associated with having EDS was 1.43 
(95%CI 1.11-1.85). The results from life table analysis suggest that a 
sixty-year-old individual with EDS had a four-year decrease in disability-free 
life years, and no change in years lived with disability.
CONCLUSIONS: EDS is associated with higher likelihood of disability, increased 
risk of mortality, and substantially shorter disability-free life expectancy at 
age 60.

OBJECTIVE: The Growth Hormone Research Society (GRS) convened a Workshop in 2017 
to evaluate clinical endpoints, surrogate endpoints and biomarkers during GH 
treatment of children and adults and in patients with acromegaly.
PARTICIPANTS: GRS invited 34 international experts including clinicians, basic 
scientists, a regulatory scientist and physicians from the pharmaceutical 
industry.
EVIDENCE: Current literature was reviewed and expert opinion was utilized to 
establish the state of the art and identify current gaps and unmet needs.
CONSENSUS PROCESS: Following plenary presentations, breakout groups discussed 
questions framed by the planning committee. The attendees re-convened after each 
breakout session to share the group reports. A writing team compiled the 
breakout session reports into a document that was subsequently discussed and 
revised by participants. This was edited further and circulated for final review 
after the meeting. Participants from pharmaceutical companies were not part of 
the writing process.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical endpoint in paediatric GH treatment is adult height 
with height velocity as a surrogate endpoint. Increased life expectancy is the 
ideal but unfeasible clinical endpoint of GH treatment in adult GH-deficient 
patients (GHDA) and in patients with acromegaly. The pragmatic clinical 
endpoints in GHDA include normalization of body composition and quality of life, 
whereas symptom relief and reversal of comorbidities are used in acromegaly. 
Serum IGF-I is widely used as a biomarker, even though it correlates weakly with 
clinical endpoints in GH treatment, whereas in acromegaly, normalization of 
IGF-I may be related to improvement in mortality. There is an unmet need for 
novel biomarkers that capture the pleiotropic actions of GH in relation to GH 
treatment and in patients with acromegaly.

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor 
quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving 
treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying 
biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide insights. We 
report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 
24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 
novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic 
fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify 
candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the 
common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under 
strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology 
and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of 
mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants 
persist in the population.

ACUTE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT ANTERIOR THIGH SELF-MASSAGE ON HIP RANGE-OF-MOTION IN 
TRAINED MEN.

BACKGROUND: Self-massage is a ubiquitous intervention similar to massage, but 
performed by the recipient him- or herself rather than by a therapist, most 
often using a tool (e.g., foam roller, roller massager). Self-massage has been 
found to have a wide range of effects. It is particularly known for increasing 
flexibility acutely, although not always. The variability of the results in 
previous studies may potentially be a function of the tool used. Recent findings 
also suggest that self-massage exerts global effects. Therefore, increased 
flexibility should be expected in the areas adjacent to the ones treated.
PURPOSE: To investigate the acute effects of foam rolling and rolling massage of 
anterior thigh on hip range-of-motion (ROM) - i.e., hip extension and hip 
flexion - in trained men.
METHODS: Eighteen recreationally active, resistance trained males visited the 
lab on two occasions over a 4-day period separated by at least a day. Each 
session included two baseline ROM measures of passive hip flexion and extension 
taken in a randomized fashion. Recording of baseline measures was followed by 
the intervention of the day, which was either foam rolling or rolling massage of 
the anterior thigh as per randomization. Immediately post intervention, passive 
hip flexion and hip extension ROM were reassessed. In order to assess the time 
course of improvements in ROM, hip flexion and hip extension ROM were 
reevaluated at 10, 20, and 30 minutes post-intervention.
RESULTS: Hip flexion and hip extension ROM increased immediately following both 
interventions (foam rolling or roller massager) and remained increased for 30 
minutes post intervention. Foam rolling was statistically superior in improving 
hip flexion and hip extension ROM immediately post intervention. However, 
immediately post-intervention was the only time point that measurements exceeded 
the minimum detectable change for both interventions.
CONCLUSION: Both foam rolling and rolling massage appear to be effective 
interventions for improving hip flexion and extension ROM when applied to the 
anterior thigh, but the observed effects are transient in nature.

BACKGROUND: Caffeine has been shown to enhance exercise performance and 
capacity. The mechanisms remain unclear but are suggested to relate to adenosine 
receptor antagonism, resulting in increased central motor drive, reduced 
perception of effort, and altered peripheral processes such as enhanced calcium 
handling and extracellular potassium regulation. Our aims were to investigate 
how caffeine (i) affects knee extensor PCr kinetics and pH during repeated sets 
of single-leg knee extensor exercise to task failure and (ii) modulates the 
interplay between central and peripheral neural processes. We hypothesized that 
the caffeine-induced extension of exercise capacity during repeated sets of 
exercise would occur despite greater disturbance of the muscle milieu due to 
enhanced peripheral and corticospinal excitatory output, central motor drive, 
and muscle contractility.
METHODS: Nine healthy active young men performed five sets of intense single-leg 
knee extensor exercise to task failure on four separate occasions: for two 
visits (6 mg·kg-1 caffeine vs placebo), quadriceps 31P-magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy scans were performed to quantify phosphocreatine kinetics and pH, 
and for the remaining two visits (6 mg·kg-1 caffeine vs placebo), femoral nerve 
electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the quadriceps cortical 
motor area were applied pre- and post exercise.
RESULTS: The total exercise time was 17.9 ± 6.0% longer in the caffeine 
(1,225 ± 86 s) than in the placebo trial (1,049 ± 73 s, p = 0.016), and muscle 
phosphocreatine concentration and pH (p < 0.05) were significantly lower in the 
latter sets of exercise after caffeine ingestion. Voluntary activation (VA) 
(peripheral, p = 0.007; but not supraspinal, p = 0.074), motor-evoked potential 
(MEP) amplitude (p = 0.007), and contractility (contraction time, p = 0.009; and 
relaxation rate, p = 0.003) were significantly higher after caffeine 
consumption, but at task failure MEP amplitude and VA were not different from 
placebo. Caffeine prevented the reduction in M-wave amplitude that occurred at 
task failure (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: Caffeine supplementation improved high-intensity exercise tolerance 
despite greater-end exercise knee extensor phosphocreatine depletion and H+ 
accumulation. Caffeine-induced increases in central motor drive and 
corticospinal excitability were attenuated at task failure. This may have been 
induced by the afferent feedback of the greater disturbance of the muscle 
milieu, resulting in a stronger inhibitory input to the spinal and supraspinal 
motor neurons. However, causality needs to be established through further 
experiments.

Outdoor air pollution may be associated with cancer risk at different sites. 
This study sought to investigate outdoor air pollution from waste gas emission 
effects on multiple cancer incidences in a retrospective population-based study 
in Shanghai, China. Trends in cancer incidence for males and females and trends 
in waste gas emissions for the total waste gas, industrial waste gas, other 
waste gas, SO2, and soot were investigated between 1983 and 2010 in Shanghai, 
China. Regression models after adjusting for confounding variables were 
constructed to estimate associations between waste gas emissions and multiple 
cancer incidences in the whole group and stratified by sex, Engel coefficient, 
life expectancy, and number of doctors per 10,000 populations to further explore 
whether changes of waste gas emissions were associated with multiple cancer 
incidences. More than 550,000 new cancer patients were enrolled and reviewed. 
Upward trends in multiple cancer incidences for males and females and in waste 
gas emissions were observed from 1983 to 2010 in Shanghai, China. Waste gas 
emissions came mainly from industrial waste gas. Waste gas emissions was 
significantly positively associated with cancer incidence of salivary gland, 
small intestine, colorectal, anus, gallbladder, thoracic organs, connective and 
soft tissue, prostate, kidney, bladder, thyroid, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 
lymphatic leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and other unspecified sites (all 
p < 0.05). Negative association between waste gas emissions and the esophagus 
cancer incidence was observed (p < 0.05). The results of the whole group were 
basically consistent with the results of the stratified analysis. The results 
from this retrospective population-based study suggest ambient air pollution 
from waste gas emissions was associated with multiple cancer incidences.

Postgraduate medical training in the Netherlands has become increasingly 
individualized. In this article, the authors describe current practices for 
three residency programs at the University Medical Center Utrecht: 
anesthesiology, pediatrics, and ophthalmology. These programs are diverse yet 
share characteristics allowing for individualized residency training. New 
residents enter each program throughout the year, avoiding a large simultaneous 
influx of inexperienced doctors. The usual duration of each is five years. 
However, the actual duration of rotations or of the program as a whole can be 
reduced because of residents' previous medical experience or demonstration of 
early mastery of relevant competencies. If necessary, the duration of training 
can also increase.Although working hours are already restricted by the European 
Working Time Directive, most residents choose to train on a part-time basis. The 
length of their program then is extended proportionally. The extension period 
added for those residents training part-time can be used to develop specific 
competencies, complete an elective rotation or research, or explore a focus 
area. If the resident meets all training objectives before the extension period 
is completed, the program director can choose to shorten the program length. 
Recently, entrustable professional activities have been introduced to strengthen 
workplace-based assessment. The effects on program duration have yet to be 
demonstrated.Flexible postgraduate training is feasible. Although improving 
work-life balance for residents is a necessity, attention must be paid to 
ensuring that they gain the necessary experience and competencies and maintain 
continuity of care to ensure that high-quality patient care is provided.

BACKGROUND: To determine the incremental gains in graft and patient survival 
under a risk-based, deceased donor kidney allocation compared with the current 
Australian algorithm.
METHODS: Risk-based matching algorithms were applied to first graft, kidney only 
recipients (n = 7513) transplanted in Australia between 1994 and 2013. 
Probabilistic models were used to compare the waiting time, life, and QALYs and 
graft years between the 8 risk-based allocation strategies against current 
practice.
RESULTS: Compared with current practice, Kidney Donor Risk Index-Estimated 
Posttransplant Survival matching of the lowest 20% of scores reduced median 
waiting time by 0.64 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.73) for 
recipients aged 30 years or younger, but increased waiting time by 0.94 years 
(95% CI, 0.79-1.09) for recipients older than 60 years. Among all age groups, 
the greatest gains occurred if Kidney Donor Risk Index-Estimated Posttransplant 
Survival matching of the lowest 30% of scores was used, incurring a median 
overall gain of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.03-1.25) life years and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.30-1.26) 
graft years compared with the current practice. A median gain in survival of 
1.91 years for younger recipients (aged 30-45 years) was offset by a median 
reduction in survival (by 0.95 life years) among the older recipients. 
Prioritization of lower-quality donor kidneys for older candidates reduced the 
waiting time for recipients older than 45 years, but no changes in graft and 
patient survivals were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-based matching engendered a moderate, overall increase in 
graft and patient survivals, accrued through benefits for recipients 45 years or 
younger but disadvantage to recipients older than 60 years.

Age-induced mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations may underlie cell loss and 
tissue aging. Rapamycin extends mouse lifespan and modulates mitochondrial 
quality control. We hypothesized that reduced deletion mutation abundance may 
contribute to rapamycin's life extension effects. To test this hypothesis, 
genetically heterogeneous male and female mice were treated with rapamycin, 
compounded in chow at 14 or 42 ppm, from 9 months to 22 months of age. Mice 
under a 40% dietary restriction were included as a control known to protect 
mtDNA quality. To determine if chronic rapamycin treatment affects mitochondrial 
DNA quality, we assayed mtDNA deletion frequency and electron transport chain 
deficient fiber abundances in mouse quadriceps muscle. At 42 ppm rapamycin, we 
observed a 57% decrease in deletion frequency, a 2.8-fold decrease in ETC 
deficient fibers, and a 3.4-fold increase in the number of mice without electron 
transport chain deficient fibers. We observed a similar trend with the 14 ppm 
dose. DR significantly decreased ETC deficient fiber abundances with a trend 
toward lower mtDNA deletion frequency. The effects of rapamycin treatment on 
mitochondrial DNA quality were greatest in females at the highest dose. 
Rapamycin treatment at 14 ppm did not affect muscle mass or function. Dietary 
restriction also reduced deletion frequency and ETC deficient fibers. These data 
support the concept that the lifespan extending effects of rapamycin treatment 
result from enhanced mitochondrial DNA quality.

Obesity is recognized as a national and global health epidemic. Commercial truck 
drivers (CTDs) have a higher obesity rate and lower life expectancy compared 
with the general population. CTDs work sedentary jobs with long hours that pose 
barriers to healthy eating and regular exercise. An evidenced-based practice 
(EBP) change project that used motivational interviewing (MI) and education 
regarding diet and exercise over a 4-week period was found to have a positive 
impact on CTDs behavior. Results revealed an increase in aggregated 
self-efficacy for weight loss (14.8%, exceeding the benchmark of 11%). For 
aggregated body mass index (BMI), CTDs lost a mean of 0.65 kg/m2, over a 4-week 
period which was statistically significant at p = .0001. The results suggest a 
short-term MI intervention can be effective when implemented as a clinical 
standard for CTDs.
