BACKGROUND: ASCERT (American College of Cardiology Foundation and the Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons Collaboration on the Comparative Effectiveness of 
Revascularization Strategies) was a large observational study designed to 
compare the long-term effectiveness of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) 
over 4 to 5 years.
OBJECTIVES: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of CABG versus PCI for 
stable ischemic heart disease.
METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and American College of Cardiology 
Foundation databases were linked to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services claims data. Costs for the index and observation period (2004 to 2008) 
hospitalizations were assessed by diagnosis-related group Medicare reimbursement 
rates; costs beyond the observation period were estimated from average Medicare 
participant per capita expenditure. Effectiveness was measured via mortality and 
life-expectancy data. Cost and effectiveness comparisons were adjusted using 
propensity score matching with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
RESULTS: CABG patients (n = 86,244) and PCI patients (n = 103,549) were at least 
65 years old with 2- or 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Adjusted costs were 
higher for CABG for the index hospitalization, study period, and lifetime by 
$10,670, $8,145, and $11,575, respectively. Patients undergoing CABG gained an 
adjusted average of 0.2525 and 0.3801 life-years relative to PCI over the 
observation period and lifetime, respectively. The life-time incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CABG compared to PCI was $30,454/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 4 years or longer, patients undergoing CABG had 
better outcomes but at higher costs than those undergoing PCI.

OBJECTIVES: We examined, from a Hong Kong healthcare providers' perspective, the 
cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnosis with Xpert in patients hospitalized for 
suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
METHODS: A decision tree was designed to simulate outcomes of three diagnostic 
assessment strategies in adult patients hospitalized for suspected active PTB: 
conventional approach, sputum smear plus Xpert for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
smear-negative, and a single sputum Xpert test. Model inputs were derived from 
the literature. Outcome measures were direct medical cost, one-year mortality 
rate, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY (ICER).
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, Xpert was more effective with higher QALYs 
gained and a lower mortality rate when compared with smear plus Xpert by an ICER 
of USD99. A conventional diagnostic approach was the least preferred option with 
the highest cost, lowest QALYs gained and highest mortality rate. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that Xpert would be the most cost-effective option if the 
sensitivity of sputum AFB smear microscopy was ≤74%. The probabilities of Xpert, 
smear plus Xpert and a conventional approach to be cost-effective were 94.5%, 
5.5% and 0%, respectively, in 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert sputum test appears to be a highly cost-effective 
diagnostic strategy for patients with suspected active PTB in an intermediate 
burden area like Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: Although tuberculous uveitis remains a major cause of ocular 
morbidity in the developing world, there is no consensus on which diagnostic 
test or testing strategy is the most cost effective. In this study we carried 
out a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the most cost-effective 
diagnostic test strategy.
METHODS: In this prospective study, we recruited 102 patients from Singapore 
National Eye Centre with signs suggestive of tuberculous uveitis. Using 
prospective data from this cohort and from published meta-analyses, we modelled 
the incremental cost effectiveness of the following strategies: tuberculin skin 
test (TST) only; interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) only; IGRA following a 
positive TST result; and dual-test strategy, conducting TST and IGRA at 
presentation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for 
each strategy and analysed using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In our population, the least cost effective was the IGRA-only strategy. 
The dual-test strategy was the most cost effective, with an improvement of 0.017 
QALY at an incremental cost of $190 relative to the TST-only strategy (ICER 
$11,500); while the TST-only strategy was more cost effective than the third 
strategy, using IGRA following a positive TST result (ICER $3610). This remained 
consistent while varying the costs of IGRA and TST, the incidence of 
tuberculosis and tuberculous uveitis, as well as the diagnostic accuracy of IGRA 
and TST found in previous studies in various populations.
CONCLUSIONS: The dual-test strategy (performing TST and IGRA at presentation) 
was the most cost effective strategy for the diagnosis of tuberculous uveitis in 
our population.

Pharmacological management of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in older 
adults with intellectual disability.

Given medical and social advances, the life expectancy of individuals with 
intellectual disability (ID) has increased dramatically, leading to a generation 
of older individuals with such disabilities. This review focuses on the 
pharmacological treatment of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and disorders 
in older adults with ID. Older adults with ID often present with medical 
co-morbidities and mental health issues. Medication management of behavioral and 
psychiatric problems is complicated by a higher risk for adverse events, lack of 
decision-making capacity, and complex care networks. Some studies have shown 
that individuals with ID and co-morbid mental disorders are undertreated in 
comparison with those with similar disorders in the general population, 
resulting in poorer outcomes. However, older adults with ID are also at risk of 
polypharmacy, and older age is a risk factor for development of side effects. A 
general principle is that medication treatment for psychiatric disorders in 
older individuals with ID should be started at low dosages and increased 
cautiously while monitoring response and side effects. The use of psychotropic 
drugs for older individuals with ID and behavioral problems remains 
controversial, particularly in those with dementia.

Merkel cell nodal carcinoma of unknown primary (MCCUP) is a rare neuroendocrine 
tumour with distinct clinical and biological behaviour. We conducted a review of 
retrospective data extracted from 90 patients focusing on the management and 
outcome of this disease. We also compared life expectancy of these patients with 
the outcome of patients with known Merkel primaries and with neuroendocrine 
cancers of unidentifiable primary. There is a limited body of data for this type 
of malignancy, however, patients with Merkel cell nodal carcinoma of unknown 
primary site, seem to have better survival when treated aggressively than 
patients with cutaneous Merkel tumours of the same stage and equal survival with 
patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumour of unknown origin. The lack of 
prospective trials, and the inadequate data, hamper the management of these 
tumours. Establishment of treatment guidelines is urgently needed.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the additional costs and 
health benefits of adding a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) (adalimumab, certolizumab, 
etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) to a synthetic DMARD (sDMARD), e.g. MTX, in 
patients with RA.
METHODS: We developed the Norwegian RA model as a Markov model simulating 10 
years of treatment with either TNFi plus sDMARDs (TNFi strategy) or sDMARDs 
alone (synthetic strategy). Patients in both strategies started in one of seven 
health states, based on the Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D). The patients could 
move to better or worse health states according to transition probabilities. In 
the TNFi strategy, patients could stay on TNFi (including switch of TNFi), or 
switch to non-TNFi-biologics (abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab), sDMARDs or no 
DMARD. In the synthetic strategy, patients remained on sDMARDs. Data from two 
observational studies were used for the assessment of resource use and utilities 
in the health states. Health benefits were evaluated using the EuroQol-5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D) and SF-6D.
RESULTS: The Norwegian RA model predicted that 10-year discounted health care 
costs totalled €124,942 (€475,266 including production losses) for the TNFi 
strategy and €65,584 (€436,517) for the synthetic strategy. The cost per 
additionally gained quality-adjusted life-year of adding a TNFi was €92,557 
(€60,227 including production losses) using SF-6D and €61,285 (€39,841) using 
EQ-5D. Including health care costs only, the probability that TNFi treatment was 
cost-effective was 90% when using EQ-5D, assuming a Norwegian willingness-to-pay 
level of €67,300.
CONCLUSION: TNFi treatment for RA is cost-effective when accounting for 
production losses. Excluding production losses, TNFi treatment is cost-effective 
using EQ-5D, but not SF-6D.

The paper aims to estimate the extent to which migrants are contributing to AIDS 
or tuberculosis (TB) mortality among rural sub-district populations. The 
Agincourt (South Africa) health and socio-demographic surveillance system 
provided comprehensive data on vital and migration events between 1994 and 2006. 
AIDS and TB cause-deleted life expectancy, and crude death rates by gender, 
migration status and period were computed. The annualised crude death rate 
almost tripled from 5·39 [95% CI 5·13-5·65] to 15·10 [95% CI 14·62-15·59] per 
1000 over the years 1994-2006. The contribution of AIDS and TB in returned 
migrants to the increase in crude death rate was 78·7% [95% CI 77·4-80·1] for 
males and 44·4% [95% CI 43·2-46·1] for females. So, in a typical South African 
setting dependent on labour migration for rural livelihoods, the contribution of 
returned migrants, many infected with AIDS and TB, to the burden of disease is 
high.

Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are the two most common immune-mediated 
inflammatory disorders affecting the skin. Genome-wide studies demonstrate a 
high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive 
clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, 
atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By 
utilizing genome-wide association study and ImmunoChip data from >19,000 
individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified 
opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific 
loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 
locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility 
complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported 
pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
risk in PRKRA and ANXA6/TNIP1. In contrast, there was no evidence for shared 
loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results 
show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with 
opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and 
immune response. The statistical analysis methods developed in the conduct of 
this study have produced additional insight from previously published data sets. 
The approach is likely to be applicable to the investigation of the genetic 
basis of other complex traits with overlapping and distinct clinical features.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rapid virologic response is the best predictor of sustained 
virologic response with dual therapy in genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C, and its 
evaluation was proposed to tailor triple therapy in F0-F2 patients. 
Bio-mathematical modelling of viral dynamics during dual therapy has potentially 
higher accuracy than rapid virologic in the identification of patients who will 
eventually achieve sustained response. Study's objective was the 
cost-effectiveness analysis of a personalized therapy in naïve F0-F2 patients 
with chronic hepatitis C based on a bio-mathematical model (model-guided 
strategy) rather than on rapid virologic response (guideline-guided strategy).
METHODS: A deterministic bio-mathematical model of the infected cell dynamics 
was validated in a cohort of 135 patients treated with dual therapy. A 
decision-analytic economic model was then developed to compare model-guided and 
guideline-guided strategies in the Italian setting.
RESULTS: The outcomes of the cost-effectiveness analysis with model-guided and 
guideline-guided strategy were 19.1-19.4 and 18.9-19.3 
quality-adjusted-life-years. Total per-patient lifetime costs were 
€25,200-€26,000 with model-guided strategy and €28,800-€29,900 with 
guideline-guided strategy. When comparing model-guided with guideline-guided 
strategy the former resulted more effective and less costly.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the bio-mathematical predictive criterion has the 
potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of a personalized therapy for 
chronic hepatitis C, reserving triple therapy for those patients who really need 
it.

Silodosin is a highly selective α1A-adrenoceptor antagonist indicated for the 
treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral 
silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men with lower urinary tract symptoms 
(LUTS) associated with BPH, with improvements seen in voiding and storage 
symptoms, maximum urinary flow rate and health-related quality of life in 
well-designed, 12-week trials. Silodosin was noninferior to tamsulosin in terms 
of improving LUTS associated with BPH. The efficacy of silodosin was maintained 
in 9-month extension studies and was also seen in a phase IV study conducted in 
a real-world setting. Silodosin was generally well tolerated and was associated 
with a low risk of orthostatic hypotension. Abnormal ejaculation was the most 
commonly reported adverse event, although few patients discontinued treatment 
with silodosin because of this adverse event. In conclusion, silodosin is a 
useful option for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH.

Meloidogyne incognita, one of the major root-knot nematode (RKN) species in 
agriculture, attacks many plant species, causing severe economic losses. Genetic 
engineering of plants with defense-responsive genes has been demonstrated to 
control RKN. These studies, however, focused on controlling RKN at certain 
growth stages. In the present study, a dual gene overexpression system, 
utilizing a plant cysteine proteinase inhibitor (CeCPI) and a fungal chitinase 
(PjCHI-1), was used to transform tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in order to 
provide protection from all growth stages of RKN. A synthetic promoter, pMSPOA, 
containing NOS-like and SP8a elements, was employed to drive the expression of 
introduced genes. Gall formation and the proportion of female nematodes in the 
population, as well as effects on the reproduction of RKN, were monitored in 
both transgenic and control plants. RKN eggs collected from transgenic plants 
displayed reduced chitin content and retardation in embryogenesis. The results 
demonstrated that transgenic plants had inhibitory effects on RKN that were 
superior to plants transformed with a single gene. The pyramiding expression 
system produced synergistic effects by the two defense-responsive genes, leading 
to a detrimental effect on all growth stages of RKN.

Do Statins Reduce the Health and Health Care Costs of Obesity?

CONTEXT: Obesity impacts both individual health and, given its high prevalence, 
total health care spending. However, as medical technology evolves, health 
outcomes for a number of obesity-related illnesses improve. This article 
examines whether medical innovation can mitigate the adverse health and spending 
associated with obesity, using statins as a case study. Because of the 
relationship between obesity and hypercholesterolaemia, statins play an 
important role in the medical management of obese individuals and the prevention 
of costly obesity-related sequelae.
METHODS: Using well-recognized estimates of the health impact of statins and the 
Future Elderly Model (FEM)-an established dynamic microsimulation model of the 
health of Americans aged over 50 years-we estimate the changes in life 
expectancy, functional status and health care costs of obesity due to the 
introduction and widespread use of statins.
RESULTS: Life expectancy gains of statins are estimated to be 5-6 % greater for 
obese individuals than for healthy-weight individuals, but most of these 
additional gains are associated with some level of disability. Considering both 
medical spending and the value of quality-adjusted life-years, statins do not 
significantly alter the costs of class 1 and 2 obesity (body mass index [BMI] 
≥30 and ≥35 kg/m(2), respectively) and they increase the costs of class 3 
obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m(2)) by 1.2 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Although statins are very effective medications for lowering the 
risk of obesity-associated illnesses, they do not significantly reduce the costs 
of obesity.

The recent medical literature highlights the lack of new drugs able to prevent 
or treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease or Parkinson 
disease. Yet, the prevalence of these diseases is growing, related to increasing 
life expectancy, and is leading to a rise in their economic and social cost. At 
the same time, pharmaceutical companies are reducing or halting their investment 
in neuropharmacological research. Why have advances in basic neuroscience and 
our understanding of these diseases not allowed innovative discoveries in drug 
research? This review will try to explain this failure and suggest possible 
solutions: develop basic and clinical research but with the emphasis on 
translational and truly collaborative research; improve preclinical studies by 
developing more appropriate animal models, using new biomarkers and 
methodologies such as imaging suitable for clinical trials, providing worthwhile 
information on the ability of the drug to reach its intended target and induce 
significant pharmacological changes; build a new system of research management, 
based on stronger interdisciplinary relations between preclinical and clinical 
research and including the introduction of international precompetitive research 
between academic teams, start-up companies and pharmaceutical laboratories; hold 
early discussions with the regulatory authorities during preclinical studies and 
at the beginning of clinical trials in order to validate the methodological 
approaches; involve patients' associations in this new organization of research. 
These changes should help to ensure the discovery of effective treatments for 
these pathologies.

The impact of social support at home on health-related quality of life among 
veterans with spinal cord injury participating in a supported employment 
program.

Circle (151R), Tampa, FL, 33637-1022, USA, Bryce.Sutton@va.gov.

PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of social support at home on health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the VR-6D utility index for spinal cord 
injury (SCI) veterans participating in a program of supported employment (SE).
METHODS: We calculated a preference-based utility index called the VR-6D from 
the responses from a 36-item instrument called the VR-36. We estimated a growth 
curve model to examine the change in the VR-6D utility index over time adjusting 
for social support status, demographics, and chronic comorbidities.
RESULTS: Study participants experienced an increase in HRQOL over time. The 
initial level and the rate of increase in HRQOL varied by groups based on their 
support status. The rate of increase in HRQOL diminished over time. Participants 
reporting no support at home experienced lower initial HRQOL but reached the 
same level of those who reported having support at home by the ninth month of 
follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years, as measured by the area under the 
curves, were approximately the same for both groups after 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the rate of change in HRQOL by support status have 
important implications for evaluations of SE programs. Participants in this 
program of SE experienced improvement in HRQOL beyond 12 months and extending to 
2 years. Follow-up times for evaluations should extend beyond 12 months to 
assess complete improvements in HRQOL. Future comparison groups in comparative 
effectiveness evaluations of SE need to be balanced carefully on support status 
in addition to other factors.

From the advent of the highly effective antiretroviral treatment, the life 
expectancy of patients with human immunodeficiency virus has increased 
significantly. At present, the causes of death are non-infectious complications. 
Between them, the pulmonary arterial hypertension has a special importance. It 
is important early detection to establish the therapeutic, with the objective of 
preventing a fatal outcome to future.

Reclaiming fertility awareness methods to inform timed intercourse for HIV 
serodiscordant couples attempting to conceive.

INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy of HIV-positive individuals during 
recent years has drawn attention to their quality of life, which includes 
fulfillment of fertility desires. In particular, heterosexual HIV serodiscordant 
couples constitute a special group for whom the balance between desired 
pregnancy and the risk of viral transmission should be carefully considered and 
optimized. Although advanced assisted reproductive technologies are available, 
such treatments are expensive and are often unavailable. Moreover, standard 
viral load testing and antiretroviral therapy may not be accessible due to 
structural or individual barriers. To reduce the risk of HIV transmission, a 
lower cost alternative is timed condomless sex combined with other 
risk-reduction strategies. However, timed condomless sex requires specific 
knowledge of how to accurately predict the fertile window in a menstrual cycle. 
The aim of this study was to summarize inexpensive fertility awareness methods 
(FAMs) that predict the fertile window and may be useful for counselling 
HIV-positive couples on lower cost options to conceive.
METHODS: Original English-language research articles were identified by a 
detailed Medline and Embase search in July 2014. Relevant citations in the 
included articles were also retrieved.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Calendar method, basal body temperature and 
cervicovaginal mucus secretions are the most accessible and sensitive FAMs, 
although poor specificity precludes their independent use in ovulation 
detection. In contrast, urinary luteinizing hormone testing is highly specific 
but less sensitive, and more expensive. To maximize the chance of conception per 
cycle, the likelihood of natural conception needs to be assessed with a basic 
fertility evaluation of both partners and a combination of FAMs should be 
offered. Adherence to other risk-reduction strategies should also be advised, 
and timely referral to reproductive medicine specialists is necessary when 
sub/infertility is suspected.
CONCLUSIONS: FAMs provide effective, economical and accessible options for HIV 
serodiscordant couples to conceive while minimizing unnecessary viral exposure. 
It is important for health care providers to initiate conversations about 
fertility desires in HIV-positive couples and to educate identified couples on 
safer conception strategies.

Achieving sustained virological response: what's the impact on further hepatitis 
C virus-related disease?

Center Rotterdam, 's Gravendijkwal 230, Room Ha 206, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands.

Continuous hepatic inflammation as a result of chronic infection with the 
hepatitis C virus may lead to the development of fibrosis and eventually 
cirrhosis. At the stage of cirrhosis, patients are at elevated risk of liver 
failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, two complications that shorten their life 
expectancy. Survival may be further impaired by the extra-hepatic manifestations 
of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, such as diabetes mellitus and lymphoma. 
Sustained virological response (SVR) following antiviral therapy has been 
associated with regression of hepatic fibrosis as well as with a reduction in 
portal pressure, both important markers of liver disease severity. Long-term 
follow-up studies indicated that SVR was related not only to a reduced 
occurrence of solid clinical end points, including liver failure and 
hepatocellular carcinoma, but also cardiovascular events and malignant 
lymphomas. Together, these findings may explain the recently observed improved 
overall survival among patients who attained SVR, even in the case of advanced 
liver disease.

Variability in edaphic factors such as clay content, organic matter, and 
nutrient availability within individual fields is a major obstacle confronting 
cotton producers. Adaptation of geospatial technologies such global positioning 
systems (GPS), yield monitors, autosteering, and the automated on-and-off 
technology required for site-specific nematicide application has provided 
growers with additional tools for managing nematodes. Multiple trials in several 
states were conducted to evaluate this technology in cotton. In a field infested 
with Meloidogyne spp., both shallow (0 to 0.3 m) and deep (0 to 0.91 m) apparent 
electrical conductivity (ECa) readings were highly correlated with sand content. 
Populations of Meloidogyne spp. were present when shallow and deep EC values 
were less than 30 and 90 mS/m, respectively. Across three years of trials in 
production fields in which verification strips (adjacent nematicide treated and 
untreated rows across all soil zones) were established to evaluate crop response 
to nematicide application, deep EC values from 27.4-m wide transects of 
verification strips were more predictive of yield response to application of 
1,3-dichloropropene than were shallow EC values in one location and both ECa 
values equally effective at predicting responses at the second location. In 
2006, yields from entire verification strips across three soil zones in four 
production fields showed that nematicide response was greatest in areas with the 
lowest EC values indicating highest content of sand. In 2008 in Ashley and 
Mississippi Counties, AR, nematicide treatment by soil zone resulted in 36% and 
42% reductions in the amount of nematicide applied relative to whole-field 
application. In 2007 in Bamberg County, SC, there was a strong positive 
correlation between increasing population densities of Meloidogyne incognita and 
increasing sand content. Trials conducted during 2007 and 2009 in South Carolina 
against Hoplolaimus columbus showed a stepwise response to increasing rates of 
aldicarb in zone 1 but not in zones 2 and 3. Site-specific application of 
nematicides has been shown to be a viable option for producers as a potential 
management tool against several nematode pathogens of cotton.

Section, New York, New York, USA.

BACKGROUND: The United Nations (UN) produces population projections for all 
countries every two years. These are used by international organizations, 
governments, the private sector and researchers for policy planning, for 
monitoring development goals, as inputs to economic and environmental models, 
and for social and health research. The UN is considering producing fully 
probabilistic population projections, for which joint probabilistic projections 
of future female and male life expectancy at birth are needed.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a methodology for obtaining joint probabilistic 
projections of female and male life expectancy at birth.
METHODS: We first project female life expectancy using a one-sex method for 
probabilistic projection of life expectancy. We then project the gap between 
female and male life expectancy. We propose an autoregressive model for the gap 
in a future time period for a particular country, which is a function of female 
life expectancy and a t-distributed random perturbation. This method takes into 
account mortality data limitations, is comparable across countries, and accounts 
for shocks. We estimate all parameters based on life expectancy estimates for 
1950-2010. The methods are implemented in the bayesLife and bayesPop R packages.
RESULTS: We evaluated our model using out-of-sample projections for the period 
1995-2010, and found that our method performed better than several possible 
alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that the average gap between female and male life 
expectancy has been increasing for female life expectancy below 75, and 
decreasing for female life expectancy above 75. Our projections of the gap are 
lower than the UN's 2008 projections for most countries and so lead to higher 
projections of male life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Blacks have lower life expectancy than whites in the United States. 
That disparity could be due to racial differences in the causes of death, with 
blacks being more likely to die of causes that affect the young, or it could be 
due to differences in the average ages of blacks and whites who die of the same 
cause. Prior studies fail to distinguish these two possibilities.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we determine how much of the 2000-10 reduction in the 
racial gap in life expectancy resulted from narrowing differences in the 
cause-specific mean age at death for blacks and whites, as opposed to changing 
cause-specific probabilities for blacks and whites.
METHOD: We introduce a method for separating the difference-in-probabilities and 
difference-inage components of group disparities in life expectancy.
RESULTS: Based on the new method, we find that 60% of the decline in the racial 
gap in life expectancy from 2000 to 2010 was attributable to reduction in the 
age component, largely because of declining differences in the age at which 
blacks and whites die of chronic diseases.
CONCLUSION: Our findings shed light on the sources of the declining racial gap 
in life expectancy in the United States, and help to identify where advances 
need to be made to achieve the goal of eliminating racial disparities in life 
expectancy.
