BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is short for patients with critical limb ischemia 
(CLI), many of whom may fear amputation more than death. In light of the reduced 
life expectancy of these patients, the traditional 5-year freedom from 
amputation (FFA) statistic may not accurately address their concern. We 
developed a more relevant patient-centered calculation of major amputation risk 
during a patient's remaining lifetime to better answer the question, Will I ever 
lose my leg?
METHODS: We identified all limbs undergoing first-time intervention for CLI in a 
large institutional database from 2005 to 2013. We calculated the traditional 
metrics of amputation-free survival (AFS, for which failure is death or 
amputation) and FFA (for which failure is amputation but deaths are censored and 
removed from further analysis). In addition, we propose a new term, lifelong 
limb preservation (LLP). LLP defines amputation as failure, but deaths are not 
censored and therefore reflect that LLP has been achieved. All deaths before 
30 days were considered a failure in all three metrics, reflecting the risk of 
surgery.
RESULTS: There were 1006 limbs identified as having first-time intervention for 
CLI (22% rest pain, 45% ulcer, 27% gangrene; 46% treated by angioplasty with or 
without stenting, 54% bypass). Using life-table analysis, 7-year AFS was 14% 
(561 events), FFA was 78% (123 events), and LLP was 86% (123 events). LLP was 
similar between patients undergoing angioplasty with or without stenting and 
bypass (7-year rates, 86% and 85%, respectively). For patients undergoing 
intervention for rest pain, 7-year rates were 14% for AFS, 84% for FFA, and 92% 
for LLP. For those undergoing treatment for ulcer, 7-year rates were 14% for 
AFS, 77% for FFA, and 86% for LLP. Finally, in those with gangrene, rates were 
10% for AFS, 67% for FFA, and 79% for LLP. Using LLP, patients presenting with 
an ulcer can be told that although we cannot guarantee how long they will live, 
with revascularization there is approximately an 86% chance they will not lose 
the leg.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the durability of our limb preservation 
efforts often exceeds the life expectancy of our patients. Using LLP as an 
outcomes assessment provides a more accurate and patient-centered answer to the 
question, If I have this procedure, will I ever lose my leg?

Chronic health conditions are commonplace in older populations. The process of 
aging impacts many of the world's top health concerns. With the average life 
expectancy continuing to climb, understanding patterns of morbidity in aging 
populations has become progressively more important. Cancer is an age-related 
disease, whose risk has been proven to increase with age. Limited information is 
published about the epidemiology of cancer and the cancer contribution to 
mortality in the 85+ age group, often referred to as the oldest-old. In this 
review, we perform a comprehensive assessment of the most recent (2011-2016) 
literature on cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality in the oldest-old. The 
data shows cancer prevalence and cancer incidence increases until ages 85-89, 
after which the rates decrease into 100+ ages. However the number of overall 
cases has steadily increased over time due to the rise in population. Cancer 
mortality continues to increase after age 85+. This review presents an overview 
of plausible associations between comorbidity, genetics and age-related 
physiological effects in relation to cancer risk and protection. Many of these 
age-related processes contribute to the lowered risk of cancer in the 
oldest-old, likewise other certain health conditions may "protect" from cancer 
in this age group.

BACKGROUND: The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) was 
developed to reduce short- and long-term complications associated with 
transvenous ICD leads. Early multicenter studies included younger patients with 
less left ventricular systolic dysfunction and fewer comorbidities than cohorts 
with traditional ICD.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize patient selection and 
the acute performance of the S-ICD in a contemporary real-world setting.
METHODS: The S-ICD Post-Approval Study is a prospective registry involving 86 US 
centers. Patients were enrolled if they met criteria for S-ICD implantation, 
passed an electrocardiogram screening test, and had a life expectancy of >1 
year. Analyses of descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier time to event, and 
multivariate logistic regression were performed.
RESULTS: The study includes 1637 patients who underwent S-ICD implantation. The 
cohort included 68.6% (1123/1637) male patients, and 13.4% (220/1636) were 
receiving dialysis for end-stage renal disease. The mean age was 52 ± 15 years, 
with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 32.0% ± 14.6%. 
Electrocardiogram screening was successful for at least 1, 2, or 3 vectors in 
100%, 93.8%, and 51.4% of patients, respectively. Medical imaging (65.1%, 
1065/1636) and general anesthesia (64.1%, 1048/16) were used in a majority of 
patients, and 52.2% (855/1637) were implanted with the 2-incision technique. 
Induced ventricular tachycardia/ventricular tachycardia was successfully 
converted in 98.7% (1394/1412) of patients. The 30-day complication-free rate 
was 96.2%. Predictors of complications included diabetes, younger age, and 
higher body mass index.
CONCLUSION: Contemporary US patients with S-ICD have more comorbidities than do 
previous cohorts with S-ICD, but they are younger with more end-stage renal 
disease than do patients with transvenous ICD. Implantation success is high, and 
short-term complication rates are acceptable.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major problem, and its prevention is a global priority. 
In many cases, suicide attempter attempts to do it again after the rescue. In 
current study we aimed to compare active visit and treatment of patients in a 
periodic manner with treatment as usual, in the prevention of recurrent suicidal 
attempts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial 
which was conducted in Isfahan Noor Hospital's Emergency Center on 60 patients 
in 2013-2014. The samples were selected using simple random sampling and they 
were assigned into two groups: The conventional treatment group (treatment as 
usual) (30 patients), and visit and active treatment (30 patients). In the 
intervention group, there were ten follow-ups by a face-to-face visit over 12 
months, and six follow-ups by phone call in control group. Through the 
completion of the initial and follow-up questionnaire evaluation was performed. 
The data were analyzed using Cochran test, and repeated measure (ANOVA).
RESULTS: During the 12-month follow-up visit and active treatment, significant 
difference in reducing suicidal thoughts (P = 0.003) was observed and an 
increase in the life expectancy (P = 0.001), interest and motivation in life (P 
= 0.001) was found in the intervention group, and also nonsignificant reduction 
was found in the rate of suicidal attempts.
CONCLUSION: Visit and active treatment is useful in suicide attempters and it 
can helps in preventing recurrent suicide attempt as a preventive program by 
increasing hope and reducing suicidal thoughts.

The prediction of life-expectancy in terminally ill patients is important both 
for medical and social reasons but it is widely recognized as being inaccurate. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the mortality predictors and indicators 
of life extension among elderly patients in a hospice service center. In order 
to determine the mortality predictors, we investigated the relationship between 
patients' cognitive status using the Korean-Mini Mental State Examination & 
Global Deterioration Scale (K-MMSE & GDS), the patient's physical function using 
the instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score, and the patient's blood 
component values. The subjects included 43 men and 57 women with a mean age of 
82.4±8.4 years, and a mean nursing period of 11.1±12.2 months. These terminally 
ill patients were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. All data were collected 
from paper and electronic charts, and patient interviews. A simple correlation 
analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the variables and 
to satisfy the normal distribution (P<0.01). The results revealed that the time 
of death negatively correlated with ADL score (r=-0.273, P=0.006). However, the 
K-MMSE & GDS, and the values of blood component such as albumin, gamma-glutamic 
transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were not correlated with the 
time of death. Consequently, the ADL score might be an important predictor of 
mortality and life extension in elderly patients. Therefore, in order to improve 
ADL score, physical exercise and overall fitness may be potential 
non-pharmacologic methods useful in preventing mortality in elderly people.

Convallatoxin is widely used as a cardiac glycoside in acute and chronic 
congestive heart-failure and paroxysmal tachycardia, with many effects and 
underlying protective mechanisms on inflammation and cellular proliferation. 
However, convallatoxin has not been investigated in its antioxidant effects and 
lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study, we found that 
convallatoxin (20 μM) could significantly prolong the lifespan of wild-type C. 
elegans up to 16.3% through daf-16, but not sir-2.1 signalling and increased 
thermotolerance and resistance to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. 
Convallatoxin also improved pharyngeal pumping, locomotion, reduced lipofuscin 
accumulation and reactive oxygen species levels in C. elegans, which were 
attributed to hormesis, free radical-scavenging effects in vivo, and 
up-regulation of stress resistance-related proteins, such as SOD-3 and HSP-16.1. 
Furthermore, aging-associated genes daf-16, sod-3, and ctl-2 also appeared to 
contribute to the stress-resistance effect of convallatoxin. In summary, this 
study demonstrates that convallatoxin can protect against heat and oxidative 
stress and extend the lifespan of C. elegans, pointing it as a potential novel 
drug for retarding the aging process in humans.

BACKGROUND: Palliative radiotherapy can improve quality of life for cancer 
patients during the last months of life. However, very short life expectancy may 
devastate the benefit of the treatment. This single center study assesses the 
utilization of radiotherapy during the last weeks of life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cancer patients (N = 38,982) treated with radiotherapy 
(N = 11,395) in Turku University Central Hospital during 2005-2013 were 
identified in the database consisting of electronic patient records. One fourth 
(N = 2904, 25.5%) of the radiotherapy treatments were given during the last year 
of life. The last radiotherapy treatments and the time from the last 
radiotherapy treatment to death were assessed in regards to patients' age, 
cancer diagnosis, domicile, place of death and the treatment year. Treatments 
given during the last two weeks of life were also assessed regarding the goal of 
treatment and the reason for possible discontinuation.
RESULTS: The median time from the last fraction of radiotherapy to death was 84 
d. During the last two weeks before death (N = 340), pain (29.4%) was the most 
common indication for radiotherapy. Treatment was discontinued in 40.6% of the 
patients during the last two weeks of life, and worsening of general condition 
was the most common reason for discontinuity (70.3%). The patients receiving 
radiotherapy during the last weeks of life were more likely to die in tertiary 
care unit. During the last year of life single-fraction treatment was used only 
in 7% of all therapy courses. There was a statistically significant (p < .05) 
decrease in the median number of fractions in the last radiotherapy treatment 
between 2005-2007 (8 fractions) and 2011-2013 (6 fractions).
CONCLUSIONS: Up to 70% of the treatments during the last two weeks of life were 
not delivered to alleviate pain and utilization of single fraction radiotherapy 
during the last year of life was infrequent. These observations suggest that 
practice of radiotherapy during the last weeks of life should be revisited.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its lipopolysaccharides play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of diabetic foot infection, for which, currently no effective 
therapeutic agents are available. Hence, newer forms of therapeutic agents are 
required for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In this present study, 
nanocrystalline silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using culture 
filtrate of Brevibacillus brevis KN8(2) followed by an investigation of its in 
vivo anti-pseudomonal and anti-endotoxic properties. Biosynthesized AgNPs was 
predominantly cubical in shape with an average particle size of 15.40 nm as 
observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray 
diffraction analysis. The LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis indicates the presence of 
surfactin in culture filtrate of B. brevis KN8(2). The MIC of 
surfactin-stabilized AgNPs against P. aeruginosa was 10 μg ml-1 and its wound 
repair activity was observed in P. aeruginosa-infected wounds of diabetic mice 
by measuring wound area closure, bacterial counts, mRNA expressions, and 
histopathology. Further, surfactin-stabilized AgNPs suppressed the transcription 
of LPS-triggered expression of the TNF-α in wounds that LPS-assisted extension 
of wound repair in diabetes mellitus conditions was circumvented quite well. 
Results gathered in this study established that surfactin-stabilized AgNPs could 
effectively offer to the novel treatment of Gram-negative bacilli infection in 
diabetic wounds.

INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Rotavirus vaccines to 
prevent and control rotavirus infections. Economic evaluations (EE) have been 
considered to support decision making of national policy. Summarizing global 
experience of the economic value of rotavirus vaccines is crucial in order to 
encourage global WHO recommendations for vaccine uptake. Therefore, a systematic 
review of economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine was conducted.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, NHS EED, EconLit, CEA Registry, SciELO, 
LILACS, CABI-Global Health Database, Popline, World Bank - e-Library, and 
WHOLIS. Full economic evaluations studies, published from inception to November 
2015, evaluating Rotavirus vaccines preventing Rotavirus infections were 
included. The methods, assumptions, results and conclusions of the included 
studies were extracted and appraised using WHO guide for standardization of EE 
of immunization programs.
RESULTS: 104 relevant studies were included. The majority of studies were 
conducted in high-income countries. Cost-utility analysis was mostly reported in 
many studies using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted or QALY 
gained. Incremental cost per QALY gained was used in many studies from 
high-income countries. Mass routine vaccination against rotavirus provided the 
ICERs ranging from cost-saving to highly cost-effective in comparison to no 
vaccination among low-income countries. Among middle-income countries, 
vaccination offered the ICERs ranging from cost-saving to cost-effective. Due to 
low- or no subsidized price of rotavirus vaccines from external funders, being 
not cost-effective was reported in some high-income settings.
CONCLUSION: Mass vaccination against rotavirus was generally found to be 
cost-effective, particularly in low- and middle-income settings according to the 
external subsidization of vaccine price. On the other hand, it may not be a 
cost-effective intervention at market price in some high-income settings. This 
systematic review provides supporting information to health policy-makers and 
health professionals when considering rotavirus vaccination as a national 
program.

AIM: Periodontal therapy has been shown to reduce glycated haemoglobin in 
patients with diabetes, although considerable uncertainty remains regarding the 
sustainability of such changes. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
non-surgical periodontal therapy and rigorous maintenance treatment in patients 
with type 2 diabetes and periodontitis from a provider perspective in the UK.
METHOD: Lifetime costs relating to periodontal treatment were modelled for a 
cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. The projected lifetime impact of 
changes in glycated haemoglobin on diabetes treatment costs and quality adjusted 
life expectancy were estimated from a published simulation model. Costs and 
outcomes were combined to estimate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio for 
periodontal therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was £28,000 per Quality 
Adjusted Life-Year for a man aged 58 with glycated haemoglobin of 7%-7.9%. The 
results were particularly sensitive to assumptions on the impact of periodontal 
therapy on glycated haemoglobin, the proportion of patients who comply with 
maintenance therapy and the proportion of compliant patients who respond to 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Assuming improvements in glycated haemoglobin can be maintained, 
periodontal therapy may be cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes at 
acceptable cost-per-Quality Adjusted Life-Year thresholds in the UK.

Preventing frailty and its adverse health outcomes is crucial in countries with 
a large elderly population, such as Japan. Since the long-term care insurance 
(LTCI) system was launched, the number of certified older adults with LTCI 
service requirement has continued to increase. This is a serious problem, 
because the LTCI service requirement certification is equivalent to disability. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a self-management group 
intervention on new LTCI service requirement certifications in 
community-dwelling older adults in Japan. We analyzed the cohort data from a 
prospective study. In this study, we recruited community-dwelling adults aged 65 
years and older who were independent in a city in Kyoto prefecture in 2012. The 
subjects in the participation group (n = 1620) attended 60-min group training 
sessions once or twice every two weeks from December 2012 to December 2016. The 
exercise sessions consisted of mild-intensity aerobic exercise, mild strength 
training, flexibility and balance exercises, and cool-down activities. These 
exercise classes were facilitated by well-trained volunteer staff. The outcome 
measure was the number of new LTCI requirement certifications during a four-year 
follow-up period. During the four-year follow-up period, 247 subjects (15.2%) in 
the participation group and 334 (20.6%) in the control group were newly 
certified for LTCI service requirements. The hazard ratio for new LTCI service 
requirements in the participation group compared with the control group was 0.73 
(95% CI = 0.62-0.86) in the four-year follow-up period. These results indicate 
the usefulness of self-management group exercise to reduce the incidence of 
disability in older adults. Thus, increasing self-management group activities in 
each community should be encouraged.

CONTEXT: With prolonged life expectancy, we often encounter patients with 
elderly-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (eT2DM). Although the clinical features 
of eT2DM are suggested to be different from those in patients with 
middle-age-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (mT2DM), the islet pathologic features 
in eT2DM have not been addressed.
OBJECTIVE: We attempted to characterize the pancreatic pathology in eT2DM and 
sought its clinical implications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreata from 13 young nondiabetic (age, 20 to 29 
years), 27 patients with mT2DM (age, 45 to 87 years), 22 middle-age subjects 
without T2DM, 15 subjects with eT2DM (age, 85 to 100 years), and 30 elderly 
subjects without T2DM were investigated. Together with conventional microscopic 
observations, morphometric analysis on the islet, islet endocrine cells, and 
amyloid deposition was conducted on immunostained sections.
RESULTS: The estimated age of diabetes onset was 80.8 ± 1.4 years (mean ± 
standard error) in the eT2DM group and that of the mT2DM group was 48.3 ± 2.4 
years. The pancreatic weight was nearly 50% less in the eT2DM group than in the 
other groups, showing duct obstruction with epithelial hyperplasia, marked 
acinar atrophy, fibrosis, and amyloid deposition in the islet. The islet mass 
was significantly reduced in the eT2DM group. The amyloid volume density 
correlated inversely with the β-cell volume density but not with the body mass 
index in the eT2DM group. Laboratory data showed mild elevation of serum amylase 
in the eT2DM group, although clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis were 
not apparent.
CONCLUSIONS: eT2DM is distinct from mT2DM and characterized by pancreas atrophy, 
ductal lesions, and amyloid deposition.

Increase in human life expectancy has resulted in the rapid growth of the 
elderly population with minimal or no intellectual deterioration. The aim of 
this stereological study of 10 structures and 5 subdivisions with and without 
neurofibrillary degeneration in the brains of 28 individuals 25-102-years-old 
was to establish the pattern of age-associated neurodegeneration and neuronal 
loss in the brains of nondemented adults and elderly. The study revealed the 
absence of significant neuronal loss in 7 regions and topographically selective 
reduction of neuronal reserve over 77 years in 8 brain structures including the 
entorhinal cortex (EC) (-33.3%), the second layer of the EC (-54%), cornu 
Ammonis sector 1 (CA1) (-28.5%), amygdala, (-45.8%), thalamus (-40.5%), caudate 
nucleus (-35%), Purkinje cells (-48.3%), and neurons in the dentate nucleus 
(40.1%). A similar rate of neuronal loss in adults and elderly, without signs of 
accelerating neuronal loss in agers or super-agers, appears to indicate 
age-associated brain remodeling with significant reduction of neuronal reserve 
in 8 brain regions. Multivariate analysis demonstrates the absence of a 
significant association between neuronal loss and the severity of 
neurofibrillary degeneration and β-amyloidosis, and a similar rate of 
age-associated neuronal loss in structures with and without neurofibrillary 
degeneration.

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare individually, but taken together, 
they affect 1 in 1,000 people. Most of the disease becomes apparent at the 
pediatric age; however, with the identification of late-onset forms, and with 
improved survival, several of these conditions may be found in adults of all 
ages. While the lung is not typically a primary site of clinical disease in 
patients with IEM, in some of them it can be a significantly affected organ with 
associated severe respiratory complications. Lung involvement can be a late- 
onset feature of a complex multisystemic disease, but sometimes it can also be 
the only manifestation of underlying IEM. The aim of this review is to focus on 
specific IEM associated with lung disease in adults and to provide the reader 
with an overview of the diagnostic workup, overall disease management, and 
specific treatments for the respiratory manifestations. Clinical suspicion, 
early recognition, prompt diagnosis, and appropriate care of the respiratory 
manifestation are crucial, as they can affect both the life expectancy and the 
quality of life of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Sexual minority (SM) individuals (gay, lesbian, bisexual, or 
otherwise nonheterosexual) are at increased risk for mental disorders and 
suicide and adequate mental healthcare may be life-saving. However, SM patients 
experience barriers in mental healthcare that have been attributed to the lack 
of SM-specific competencies and heterosexist attitudes and behaviors on the part 
of mental health professionals. Such barriers could have a negative impact on 
common treatment factors such as treatment expectancy or therapeutic alliance, 
culminating in poorer treatment outcomes for SM versus heterosexual patients. 
Actual empirical data from general psychiatric settings is lacking, however. 
Thus, comparing the treatment outcome of heterosexual and SM patients at risk 
for suicide was the primary aim of this study. The secondary aim was to compare 
treatment expectation and working alliance as two common factors.
METHODS: We report on 633 patients from a suicide prevention inpatient 
department within a public psychiatric hospital. Most patients were at risk for 
suicide due to a recent suicide attempt or warning signs for suicide, usually in 
the context of a severe psychiatric disorder. At least one indicator of SM 
status was reported by 21% of patients. We assessed the treatment outcome by 
calculating the quantitative change in suicide ideation, hopelessness, and 
depression. We also ran related treatment responder analyses. Treatment 
expectation and working alliance were the assessed common factors.
RESULTS: Contrary to the primary hypothesis, SM and heterosexual patients were 
comparable in their improvement in suicide ideation, hopelessness, or 
depression, both quantitatively and in treatment responder analysis. Contrary to 
the secondary hypothesis, there were no significant sexual orientation 
differences in treatment expectation and working alliance. When adjusting for 
sociodemographics, diagnosis, and length of stay, some sexual orientation 
differences became significant, indicating that SM patients have better 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These unexpected but positive findings may be due to common factors 
of therapy compensating for SM-specific competencies. It may also be due to 
actual presence of SM competencies - though unmeasured - in the department. 
Replication in other treatment settings and assessment of SM-specific 
competencies are needed, especially in the field of suicide prevention, before 
these findings can be generalized.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer mortality 
among women in South Vietnam and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in 
North Vietnam. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has the potential to 
substantially decrease this burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommends that a cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination is conducted 
before nationwide introduction.
METHODS: The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modeling and Economics (PRIME) 
model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine introduction. A 
costing study based on expert panel discussions, interviews and hospital case 
note reviews was conducted to explore the cost of cervical cancer care.
RESULTS: The cost of cervical cancer treatment ranged from US$368 - 11400 
depending on the type of hospital and treatment involved. Under Gavi-negotiated 
prices of US$4.55, HPV vaccination is likely to be very cost-effective with an 
incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the range 
US$780 - 1120. However, under list prices for Cervarix and Gardasil in Vietnam, 
the incremental cost per DALY averted for HPV vaccination can exceed US$8000.
CONCLUSION: HPV vaccine introduction appears to be economically attractive only 
if Vietnam is able to procure the vaccine at Gavi prices. This highlights the 
importance of initiating a nationwide vaccination programme while such prices 
are still available.

Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly in the older 
ages. Women have a longer life expectancy and are more likely to experience 
stroke than men. Interestingly, the increased risk of ischemic stroke in women 
seems to be independent from age or classical cardiovascular risk factors. 
Notwithstanding the fact that stroke outcomes and survival are usually poorer in 
women, current evidence suggests that thrombolysis, antiplatelet and 
anticoagulant therapies are more beneficial in women than in men. A possible 
explanation of this paradox might be that females are often undertreated and 
they have fewer chances to be submitted to an effective and timely treatment for 
stroke than the male counterpart. The first step in the attempt to solve this 
obvious discrimination is surely to emphasize any reasons for differences in the 
therapeutic approach in relation to gender and then to denounce the lack of a 
sustainable motivation for them. In this article, we aimed to review the 
existing literature about gender-related differences on efficacy, administration 
and side effects of the most common drugs used for the treatment of ischemic 
stroke. The most striking result was the evidence that the therapeutic approach 
for stroke is often different according to patients' gender with a clear 
detrimental prognostic effect for women. A major effort is necessary to overcome 
this problem in order to ensure equal right to treatment without any sexual 
discrimination.

Vertebrate dentitions are extraordinarily diverse in both morphology and 
regenerative capacity. The teleost order Tetraodontiformes exhibits an 
exceptional array of novel dental morphologies, epitomized by constrained 
beak-like dentitions in several families, i.e., porcupinefishes, three-toothed 
pufferfishes, ocean sunfishes, and pufferfishes. Modification of tooth 
replacement within these groups leads to the progressive accumulation of tooth 
generations, underlying the structure of their beaks. We focus on the dentition 
of the pufferfish (Tetraodontidae) because of its distinct dental morphology. 
This complex dentition develops as a result of (i) a reduction in the number of 
tooth positions from seven to one per quadrant during the transition from first 
to second tooth generations and (ii) a dramatic shift in tooth morphogenesis 
following the development of the first-generation teeth, leading to the 
elongation of dental units along the jaw. Gene expression and 
1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) lineage 
tracing reveal a putative dental epithelial progenitor niche, suggesting a 
highly conserved mechanism for tooth regeneration despite the development of a 
unique dentition. MicroCT analysis reveals restricted labial openings in the 
beak, through which the dental epithelium (lamina) invades the cavity of the 
highly mineralized beak. Reduction in the number of replacement tooth positions 
coincides with the development of only four labial openings in the pufferfish 
beak, restricting connection of the oral epithelium to the dental cavity. Our 
data suggest the spatial restriction of dental regeneration, coupled with the 
unique extension of the replacement dental units throughout the jaw, are primary 
contributors to the evolution and development of this unique beak-like 
dentition.

Many eukaryotic cells grow by extending their cell periphery in pulses. The 
molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not yet fully understood. Here 
we present a comprehensive model of stepwise cell extension by using the unique 
tip growth system of filamentous fungi. Live-cell imaging analysis, including 
superresolution microscopy, revealed that the fungus Aspergillus nidulans 
extends the hyphal tip in an oscillatory manner. The amount of F-actin and 
secretory vesicles (SV) accumulating at the hyphal tip oscillated with a 
positive temporal correlation, whereas vesicle amounts were negatively 
correlated to the growth rate. The intracellular Ca2+ level also pulsed with a 
positive temporal correlation to the amount of F-actin and SV at the hyphal tip. 
Two Ca2+ channels, MidA and CchA, were needed for proper tip growth and the 
oscillations of actin polymerization, exocytosis, and the growth rate. The data 
indicate a model in which transient Ca2+ pluses cause depolymerization of 
F-actin at the cortex and promote SV fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby 
extending the cell tip. Over time, Ca2+ diffuses away and F-actin and SV 
accumulate again at the hyphal tip. Our data provide evidence that temporally 
controlled actin polymerization and exocytosis are coordinated by pulsed Ca2+ 
influx, resulting in stepwise cell extension.

Nature, scope and use of economic evaluation of healthcare programmes: with 
special reference to Pakistan.

(1)Community Health Sciences Department, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.

Economic evaluation (EE)/cost effectiveness analysis(CEA) of healthcare 
programmes is an emerging area, yet the resource base to apprehend EE/CEA is 
very limited in Pakistan. This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a 
basic text in the field of EE with special reference to Pakistan. We used four 
dimensional criteria (available, relevant, complete and accurate) for reviewing 
the EE contents in the locally available textbooks and reading material on 
public health. We find CEA as core competency and skill of medical doctors in 
undergraduate medical curricula yet we could not find EE contents in the 
recommended textbooks. We find that economic evaluation entails two rules: both 
cost and effectiveness should be included in the analysis, and there must be a 
comparison of at least two drugs or medical intervention. We describe EE/CEA in 
this article and recommend that EE content should be included in the medical and 
public health curriculum in Pakistan.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the commonest hemoglobinopathy and is 
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is 
reported to play a significant role in this regard. There is very limited 
literature on PH in SCA in Nigeria.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of 
Doppler-derived PH in SCA, assess its influence on exercise capacity, and 
determine the correlates and predictors of measures of estimated pulmonary 
pressure.
METHODS: A total of 92 SCA subjects had echocardiography and 6-minute self-paced 
walking exercise. PH was diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography on finding a 
tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) of ≥2.5 m/s. The pulmonary flow profile was 
also assessed to estimate mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP).
RESULTS: Doppler-derived PH was detected in 23.9% of adults with SCA. The 
6-minute walking distance (6MWD) was significantly lower in SCA adults with PH 
than in those without PH (380.33 ± 63.17 m vs 474.28 ± 76.74 m; p = 0.014). TRV 
and estimated MPAP had a significant inverse correlation with the 6MWD (r = 
-0.442; p < 0.001 and r = -0.571; p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: PH as derived by Doppler is common in Nigerian adults with SCA and 
has a significantly negative influence on exercise capacity. Screening for PH 
should be encouraged to optimize management and thus improve their quality of 
life and life expectancy.
