BACKGROUND: Approximately 25 % of pregnant women suffer from a high level of 
Fear of Childbirth (FoC), as assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy 
Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A, score ≥66). FoC negatively affects pregnant women's 
mental health and adaptation to the perinatal period. Mindfulness-Based 
Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) seems to be potentially effective in decreasing 
pregnancy-related anxiety and stress. We propose a theoretical model of 
Avoidance and Participation in Pregnancy, Birth and the Postpartum Period in 
order to explore FoC and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of change of 
MBCP.
METHODS/DESIGN: The 'I've Changed My Mind' study is a quasi-experimental 
controlled trial among 128 pregnant women (week 16-26) with a high level of FoC, 
and their partners. Women will be allocated to MBCP (intervention group) or to 
Fear of Childbirth Consultation (FoCC; comparison group). Primary outcomes are 
FoC, labour pain, and willingness to accept obstetrical interventions. Secondary 
outcomes are anxiety, depression, general stress, parental stress, quality of 
life, sleep quality, fatigue, satisfaction with childbirth, birth outcome, 
breastfeeding self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The total study duration for 
women is six months with four assessment waves: pre- and post-intervention, 
following the birth and closing the maternity leave period.
DISCUSSION: Given the high prevalence and severe negative impact of FoC this 
study can be of major importance if statistically and clinically meaningful 
benefits are found. Among the strengths of this study are the clinical-based 
experimental design, the extensive cognitive-emotional and behavioural 
measurements in pregnant women and their partners during the entire perinatal 
period, and the representativeness of study sample as well as generalizability 
of the study's results. The complex and innovative measurements of FoC in this 
study are an important strength in clinical research on FoC not only in pregnant 
women but also in their partners.

BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is one of the most common lipid-storage disorders, 
affecting approximately 1 in 75,000 births. Enzyme replacement therapy with 
recombinant glucocerebrosidase is currently considered the first-line treatment 
choice for patients with symptomatic Gaucher disease type 1. Oral substrate 
reduction therapy is generally considered a second-line treatment option for 
adult patients with mild to moderate Gaucher disease type 1 who are unable or 
unwilling to receive lifelong intravenous enzyme infusions. The efficacy and 
safety of the oral substrate reduction therapy miglustat (Zavesca®) in patients 
with Gaucher disease type 1 have been established in both short-term clinical 
trials and long-term, open-label extension studies. Published data indicate that 
miglustat can be used as maintenance therapy in patients with stable Gaucher 
disease type 1 switched from previous enzyme replacement therapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with Gaucher 
disease type 1 who was initially treated with enzyme replacement therapy but, 
owing to repeated cutaneous allergic reactions, had to be switched to miglustat 
after several attempts with enzyme replacement therapy. Despite many attempts, 
desensitization treatment did not result in improved toleration of imiglucerase 
infusions, and the patient became unwilling to continue with any intravenous 
enzyme replacement therapy. He subsequently agreed to switch to oral substrate 
reduction therapy with miglustat 100 mg twice daily titrated up to 100 mg three 
times daily over a short period. Long-term miglustat treatment maintained both 
hemoglobin and platelet levels within acceptable ranges over 8 years. The 
patient's spleen volume decreased, his plasma chitotriosidase levels stayed at 
reduced levels, and his bone mineral density findings have remained stable 
throughout follow-up. The patient's quality of life has remained satisfactory. 
Miglustat showed good gastrointestinal tolerability in this patient, and no 
adverse events have been reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral miglustat therapy proved to be a valid alternative treatment 
to intravenous enzyme replacement therapy for long-term maintenance in this 
patient with Gaucher disease type 1, who showed persistent allergic intolerance 
to imiglucerase infusions. This report exemplifies the type of patient with 
Gaucher disease type 1 who can benefit from switching from enzyme replacement 
therapy to substrate reduction therapy.

BACKGROUND: Policies of active case finding for cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
prevention in healthy adults are common, but economic evaluation has not 
investigated targeting such strategies at those who are most likely to benefit.
AIM: To assess the cost effectiveness of targeted case finding for CVD 
prevention.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness modelling in an English primary care 
population.
METHOD: A cohort of 10 000 individuals aged 30-74 years and without existing CVD 
or diabetes was sampled from The Health Improvement Network database, a large 
primary care database. A discrete-event simulation was used to model the process 
of inviting people for assessment, assessing cardiovascular risk, and initiation 
and persistence with drug treatment. Risk factors and drug cessation rates were 
obtained from primary care data. Published sources provided estimates of uptake 
of assessment, treatment initiation, and treatment effects. The researchers 
determined the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with 
opportunistic case finding, and strategies prioritising and targeting patients 
by age or prior estimate of cardiovascular risk. This study reports on the 
optimum strategy if a QALY is valued at £20 000.
RESULTS: Compared with no case finding, inviting all adults aged 30-74 years in 
a population of 10 000 yields 30.32 QALYs at a total cost of £705 732. The 
optimum strategy is to rank patients by prior risk estimate and invite 8% of 
those who are assessed as being at highest risk (those at ≥12.76% predicted 
10-year CVD risk), yielding 17.53 QALYs at a cost of £162 280. There is an 89.4% 
probability that the optimum strategy is to invite <35% of patients for 
assessment.
CONCLUSION: Across all age ranges, targeted case finding using a prior estimate 
of CVD risk is more efficient than universal case finding in healthy adults.

BACKGROUND: Cancer screening is a behavior that represents investment in future 
health. Such investment may depend on how much 'future' a person expects.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prospective 
association between perceived personal life expectancy and participation in 
fecal occult blood test screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in a national 
program.
METHODS: Data were from interviews with 3975 men and women in the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) within the eligible age range for the 
national screening program (60 to 74 years). Perceived life expectancy was 
indexed as the individual's estimate of their chance of living another 
10-15 years (exact time varied by age), assessed in 2008/2009. Participation in 
CRC screening from 2010 to 2012/2013 was assessed in 2012/2013. Logistic 
regression was used to estimate the association between perceived life 
expectancy and screening participation, adjusted for numeracy and known 
mortality risk factors.
RESULTS: Overall, 71% of respondents (2817/3975) reported completing at least 
one fecal occult blood test (FOBt) during the follow-up. Screening uptake was 
76% (1272/1683) among those who estimated their 10-15-year life expectancy as 
75-100%, compared with 52% (126/243) among those who estimated theirs as 0-25% 
(adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29-2.34).
CONCLUSIONS: A longer perceived life expectancy is associated with greater 
likelihood of participating in CRC screening in England. However, half of people 
with a low perceived life expectancy still participated in screening. Given that 
CRC screening is recommended for adults with a remaining life expectancy of 
≥10 years, future research should investigate how to communicate the aims of 
screening more effectively.

People with learning disabilities, particularly Down's syndrome, are at 
increased risk of dementia. At present, services and care tailored to people 
with both dementia and a learning disability are unsatisfactory. This article 
reviews the literature specific to dementia in people with learning 
disabilities, including: comprehensive screening, diagnosis, management, 
environmental considerations, end of life care and training issues for nursing 
staff. Recommendations for best practice and service improvement are made to 
improve the quality of life for individuals with dementia and learning 
disabilities, pre and post-diagnosis.

A consensus conference of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 
and American College of Endocrinology held in February 2016 advocated expanding 
the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the management of diabetes. 
Based on the data described in this paper, CGM use is shown to improve glucose 
control and reduce hypoglycemic events, and therefore has the potential to 
reduce the risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Likely, all of 
the above would not only improve the quality of life and life expectancy of 
people with diabetes, but would also have a positive impact on health-related 
cost.

Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia in older patients. 
The prevalence is higher in women than in men. This may be the result of both 
the higher life expectancy of women and the loss of neuroprotective estrogen 
after menopause. Earlier age at menopause (spontaneous or surgical) is 
associated with an enhanced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, 
it is postulated that estrogen could be protective against it. If so, increasing 
exposure to estrogen through the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement could 
also be protective against Alzheimer's disease. The results of the clinical 
studies that have examined this hypothesis are inconclusive, however. One 
explanation for this is that estrogen treatment is protective only if it is 
initiated in the years immediately after menopause. Another possibility is that 
the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are negated by a particular genotype of 
apolipoprotein E. This protein plays an important role in cholesterol transport 
to the neurons. Studies that have examined the link between estrogen replacement 
therapy, Alzheimer's disease and the E4 allele of ApoE are inconclusive. This 
article reviews the literature on the influence of hormone replacement therapy 
on the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Early parenthood as a link between childhood disadvantage and adult heart 
problems: A gender-based approach.

Drawing on conceptual models of critical periods, major life transitions, and 
life pathways, we proposed that the life-course features of parenthood are 
important, but understudied, mechanisms for explaining possibly gendered 
heart-health outcomes. Using three waves from the Midlife in the U.S. Study 
(MIDUS), we investigated (a) gender differences in the timing of the transition 
to parenthood as a pathway linking childhood SES disadvantage to onset of heart 
problems and (b) life-course factors (which vary by gender) that link the timing 
of the transition to parenthood to adult heart problems. We found that 
individuals who were disadvantaged in childhood were more likely to have their 
first child as teenagers or in early young adulthood. For women only, an early 
transition to parenthood partially explained the association between childhood 
disadvantage and onset of heart problems. Furthermore, women who had their first 
child at younger ages, particularly in their teens, had lower rates of college 
graduation, more financial difficulties, higher levels of depressive symptoms, 
and greater risk of smoking and obesity in midlife. These factors partially 
accounted for the association between early parenthood and onset of heart 
problems in later life. Our findings underscore the significance of the timing 
of the transition to parenthood in specifying the associations between childhood 
disadvantage and adult heart problems. Various factors are involved, including 
low adult SES, psychological distress, and unhealthy lifestyles.

Polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer, or 
Soluplus®, is a relatively new copolymer and a promising carrier of amorphous 
solid dispersions. Knowledge on the inherent properties of Soluplus® (e.g. cloud 
points, critical micelle concentrations, and viscosity) in different conditions 
is relatively inadequate, and the application characteristics of Soluplus®-based 
solid dispersions made by microwave methods still need to be clarified. In the 
present investigation, the inherent properties of a Soluplus® carrier, including 
cloud points, critical micelle concentrations, and viscosity, were explored in 
different media and in altered conditions. Ibuprofen, a BCS class II 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was selected to develop Soluplus®-based 
amorphous solid dispersions using the microwave-quench cooling (MQC) method. 
Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were adopted to analyze amorphous properties and 
molecular interactions in ibuprofen/Soluplus® amorphous solid dispersions 
generated by MQC. Dissolution, dissolution extension, phase solubility, 
equilibrium solubility, and supersaturated crystallization inhibiting 
experiments were performed to elucidate the effects of Soluplus® on ibuprofen in 
solid dispersions. This research provides valuable information on the inherent 
properties of Soluplus® and presents a basic understanding of Soluplus® as a 
carrier of amorphous solid dispersions.

This article describes an interdisciplinary pilot study exploring the impact of 
LGBTQ senior centers on the lives of center members. Many LGBTQ adults face the 
future having experienced stigma and bias, restricted rights, and rejection from 
family of origin, and are now growing older without the support of a partner and 
adult children. As a result, older LGBTQ adults experience higher rates of 
depression, loneliness and isolation, and shortened life expectancy as compared 
to non-LGBTQ peers. Findings from focus group and key informant interviews 
highlight features of LGBTQ senior center experiences that can significantly 
improve members' quality of life. These include providing family, acceptance and 
a home, which can have an impact on outlook and outcomes. Moreover, findings 
suggest the need for re-thinking hetero-normative definitions of "community" in 
the context of LGBTQ aging. Beyond sharing findings from the study, suggesting a 
conceptual framework for deepening understanding about LGBTQ aging, and 
identifying lines of future inquiry, the article articulates implications for 
social work research, practice and education. Ultimately, the article argues 
that social work is well positioned to improve quality of life for this 
under-served population when it adopts a cultural humility stance in research, 
practice and education.

Palliative Care in Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Palliative care is specialized care for people with life-limiting illness; it 
focuses on symptom management and quality of life and ensures that a patient's 
care is concordant with her goals and values. Unlike end-of-life care, 
palliative care can be offered concurrently with disease-directed therapies, 
including when the goal is cure. Obstetrics and gynecology patients for whom 
palliative care is most appropriate include women with gynecologic cancer and 
women with a fetus or neonate with a potentially life-limiting illness. 
Integration of palliative care for these patients offers both clinical and 
health care utilization benefits, including improved symptom management, 
improved quality of life, and high-value care. Palliative care can be provided 
by palliative care specialists (specialty palliative care) or by the team 
treating the life-limiting illness (primary palliative care), depending on the 
complexity of the need. Health care providers caring for patients with 
life-limiting illness, including obstetrician-gynecologists, must possess a 
basic primary palliative care skill set, including symptom management for common 
symptoms such as pain and nausea and communication skills such as breaking bad 
news. This skill set must be taught and evaluated during training and used 
consistently in practice to ensure that our patients receive truly comprehensive 
care.

The age associated decline in immune function is preceded in mammals by a 
reduction in thymic output. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence of a link 
between immune competence and lifespan. One approach to determining thymic 
output is to quantify signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sj-TRECs), 
a method which has been developed and used in several mammalian species. Life 
expectancy and the rate of aging vary in dogs depending upon their breed. In 
this study, we quantified sj-TRECs in blood samples from dogs of selected breeds 
to determine whether there was a relationship between longevity and thymic 
output. In Labrador retrievers, a breed with a median expected lifespan of 11 
years, there was an age-associated decline in sj-TREC values, with the greatest 
decline occurring before 5 years of age, but with sj-TREC still detectable in 
some geriatric animals, over 13 years of age. In large short-lived breeds 
(Burnese mountain dogs, Great Danes and Dogue de Bordeaux), the decline in 
sj-TREC values began earlier in life, compared with small long-lived breeds 
(Jack Russell terriers and Yorkshire terriers), and the presence of animals with 
undetectable sj-TRECs occurred at a younger age in the short-lived breeds. The 
study findings suggest that age-associated changes in canine sj-TRECs are 
related to breed differences in longevity, and this research highlights the use 
of dogs as a potential model of immunosenescence.

INTRODUCTION: The sex ratio at birth is commonly expressed as M/T, denoting male 
births divided by total births. Males are almost invariably born slightly in 
excess. Stress and negative socioeconomic conditions lower M/T and this has been 
mooted as a possible reason for the observed low M/T for Black births worldwide. 
South Africa is experiencing a period of economic prosperity. This study was 
carried out in order to ascertain whether improving conditions in South Africa 
as measured by available health indicators, were associated with a rise in M/T 
in this country.
METHODS: Annual male and female births were obtained from Statistics South 
Africa along with key health indicators: total fertility rate, life expectancy, 
infant mortality and under 5year mortality, for 2003-2014.
RESULTS: There were a total of 12,409,437 births (M/T 0.5035, 95% CI 
0.5032-0.5037). There was a rise in M/T over the initial period studied 
(2003-2010) with a plateau thereafter. The rise over the entire period studied 
was significant (Chi for linear trend=30.3, p<0.0001). M/T was significantly 
positively correlated with life expectancy and significantly negatively 
correlated with infant mortality, under 5year mortality and total fertility 
rate.
DISCUSSION: It has been mooted that the lower M/T observed in Blacks may be 
stress-related. The observed rise in M/T associated with health improvements in 
South Africa support this contention. Moreover, this study suggests that M/T may 
serve as a sentinel health indicator, and may not only highlight adverse 
conditions through its decline, but also improvements in overall conditions with 
its rise.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spread to humans from chimpanzees (HIV-1 
groups M and N), gorillas (HIV-1 groups P and O), and sooty mangabeys (HIV-2). 
HIV is spread mainly through blood or body fluids. Subjects can become infected 
with HIV by sexual contact, needle sharing, blood transfusions, or maternal 
transmissions as a blood-borne virus or via breast-milk. The incubation period 
of HIV-1 from infection to the development of AIDS ranges from 8 to 11 years. In 
the past 3 decades, HIV has caused a great burden to global wealth and health. 
According to the WHO global health survey, 36.7 million people were infected 
with HIV, causing 1.1 million deaths in 2015. Since the discovery of HIV-1, many 
anti-retroviral drugs have been developed. Following the discovery and 
wide-spread use of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) the life expectancy of HIV 
infected individuals has substantially increased. By 2015, all major guidelines 
recommended treating all HIV-infected adults regardless of their CD4 count. 
Despite effective ART with virological suppression, HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorders (HAND), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), metabolic 
syndrome (MS), bone abnormalities and non-HIV-associated malignancies remain a 
major complication associated with HIV infection. In this review article, I 
would like to describe recent ART status and problems in the ART-era.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact that longer 
battery life of cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices 
has on reducing the number of device replacements and associated costs of these 
replacements from a Swedish health care system perspective.
METHODS: An economic model based on real-world published data was developed to 
estimate cost savings and avoided device replacements for CRT-Ds with longer 
battery life compared with devices with industry-standard battery life 
expectancy. Base-case comparisons were performed among CRT-Ds of three 
manufacturers - Boston Scientific Corporation, St. Jude Medical, and Medtronic - 
over a 6-year time horizon, as per the available clinical data. As a sensitivity 
analysis, we evaluated CRT-Ds as well as single-chamber implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (ICD-VR) and dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
(ICD-DR) devices over a longer 10-year period. All costs were in 2015 Swedish 
Krona (SEK) discounted at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis results show that up to 603 replacements and up to 
SEK 60.4 million cumulative-associated costs could be avoided over 6 years by 
using devices with extended battery life. The pattern of savings over time 
suggests that savings are modest initially but increase rapidly beginning in the 
third year of follow-up with each year's cumulative savings two to three times 
the previous year. Evaluating CRT-D, ICD-VR, and ICD-DR devices together over a 
longer 10-year period, the sensitivity analysis showed 2,820 fewer replacement 
procedures and associated cost savings of SEK 249.3 million for all 
defibrillators with extended battery life.
CONCLUSION: Extended battery life is likely to reduce device replacements and 
associated complications and costs, which may result in important cost savings 
and a more efficient use of health care resources as well as a better quality of 
life for heart failure patients in Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Global epidemic of diabetes is a serious health care concern because 
of its complications and consequently reduced life expectancy and increased 
morbidity. However, the bone turnover and thus bone health may be affected or 
even compromised by diabetes and its complications. The aim of this study was to 
assess whether bone turnover markers are associated with diabetes micro-vascular 
complications.
METHODS: A total of 204 type 2 diabetes patients (104 patients with diabetic 
micro-vascular complications (retinopathy and/or nephropathy) as a case group 
and 100 patients without retinopathy and/or nephropathy) as a control group were 
recruited in this case-control study. The biochemical and metabolic parameters 
and bone turnover markers were assessed in all patients.
RESULTS: Our findings showed serum levels of osteocalcin (OC) (p = 0.0001) and, 
carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) (p = 0.006) were higher in diabetic 
patients with both diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy compared with control 
group. However, there was no significant difference in serum levels of 
procollagen I aminoterminal propeptide (P1NP) between diabetic patients with 
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and/or diabetic nephropathy (DN) compared with 
control. In diabetes patients with complications, there were significant 
negative correlation between OC and CTX with estimated-glomerular filtration 
rate (e-GFR) and also positive correlation between each bone marker (OC and CTX) 
and PTH levels (p = 0.0001) and BUN (p = 0.0001). In a general linear model, 
after adjusting for age, sex and BMI, and microvascular complications, there was 
not any significant association between three bone turnover markers and 
metabolic markers including fasting glucose, insulin, and lipid profile. Among 
kidney markers, there were significant positive associations between serum 
levels of CTX and OC with BUN (p < 0.05) as well as PTH (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the possible role of PTH and BUN levels in 
modulating bone turnover markers in diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: In treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), age does not 
represent a contraindication to surgery, even if aging is known to increase 
postoperative mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, long-term outcome remains 
poor and there is much debate on whether to operate or not in elderly patients. 
The aim of this study was to provide a general framework to evaluate the health 
gain obtainable from surgery for PDAC in relationship with age and tumor stage.
METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation model was built taking into consideration 
pertinent literature from population-based studies regarding surgical and 
non-surgical outcomes for stages I-II PDAC. The health gain obtainable from 
surgery, in comparison to the choice of not resecting patients, was measured 
through number needed-to-treat (NNT) calculation.
RESULTS: Considering the typical stage I-II PDAC characteristics, the model 
showed that the mean lifespan after surgery was 28.1 ± 3.9 months and 
9.3 ± 1.5 months after non-surgical therapies. The NNT with surgery in order to 
prevent one death at 5 years was 6 (95% CI 4-10), indicating an overall high 
gain obtainable from surgery. Sensitivity analyses on patient age and tumor 
stage suggested that starting from 76 years onward, the NNT progressively 
increases, resulting in a low cure rate of surgery in the elderly and becoming 
potentially harmful for patients aged above 80 years. These figures were more 
pronounced for tumor stages IIA and IIB.
CONCLUSIONS: The present general framework suggests that the lifespan benefit 
obtainable from pancreatectomy in elderly patients is uncertain especially with 
the advancing of the tumor stage.

The omega loop in β-lactamases plays a pivotal role in substrate recognition and 
catalysis, and some mutations in this loop affect the adaptability of the 
enzymes to new antibiotics. Various mutations, including substitutions, 
deletions, and intragenic duplications resulting in tandem repeats (TRs), have 
been associated with β-lactamase substrate spectrum extension. TRs are unique 
among the mutations as they cause severe structural perturbations in the 
enzymes. We explored the process by which TRs are accommodated in order to test 
the adaptability of the omega loop. Structures of the mutant enzymes showed that 
the extra amino acid residues in the omega loop were freed outward from the 
enzyme, thereby maintaining the overall enzyme integrity. This structural 
adjustment was accompanied by disruptions of the internal α-helix and hydrogen 
bonds that originally maintained the conformation of the omega loop and the 
active site. Consequently, the mutant enzymes had a relaxed binding cavity, 
allowing for access of new substrates, which regrouped upon substrate binding in 
an induced-fit manner for subsequent hydrolytic reactions. Together, the data 
demonstrate that the design of the binding cavity, including the omega loop with 
its enormous adaptive capacity, is the foundation of the continuous evolution of 
β-lactamases against new drugs.

Apelin Signaling in Sprout Progression.

Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting or 
splitting of existing blood vessels. During sprouting, a highly motile type of 
endothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed 
by stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To 
get more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an 
existing computational model of vascular network formation based on the cellular 
Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a priori 
assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To predict 
potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip cells (a) 
move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the angiogenic 
networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less effectively to 
an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to the tips of the 
sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A comparison of this 
model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip and stalk cells 
revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its receptor APJ may 
match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we inhibited Apelin 
signaling in our model and in an in vitro model of angiogenic sprouting, and 
found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of its receptor APJ reduces 
sprouting. Based on the prediction of the computational model, we propose that 
the differential expression of Apelin and APJ yields a "self-generated" gradient 
mechanisms that accelerates the extension of the sprout.

Early Mode of Life and Hatchling Size in Cephalopod Molluscs: Influence on the 
Species Distributional Ranges.

Cephalopods (nautiluses, cuttlefishes, squids and octopuses) exhibit direct 
development and display two major developmental modes: planktonic and benthic. 
Planktonic hatchlings are small and go through some degree of morphological 
changes during the planktonic phase, which can last from days to months, with 
ocean currents enhancing their dispersal capacity. Benthic hatchlings are 
usually large, miniature-like adults and have comparatively reduced dispersal 
potential. We examined the relationship between early developmental mode, 
hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution range of 110 species hatched 
in the laboratory, which represent 13% of the total number of live cephalopod 
species described to date. Results showed that species with planktonic 
hatchlings reach broader distributional ranges in comparison with species with 
benthic hatchlings. In addition, squids and octopods follow an inverse 
relationship between hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution. In 
both groups, species with smaller hatchlings have broader latitudinal 
distribution ranges. Thus, squid and octopod species with larger hatchlings have 
latitudinal distributions of comparatively minor extension. This pattern also 
emerges when all species are grouped by genus (n = 41), but was not detected for 
cuttlefishes, a group composed mainly of species with large and benthic 
hatchlings. However, when hatchling size was compared to adult size, it was 
observed that the smaller the hatchlings, the broader the latitudinal 
distributional range of the species for cuttlefishes, squids and octopuses. This 
was also valid for all cephalopod species with benthic hatchlings pooled 
together. Hatchling size and associated developmental mode and dispersal 
potential seem to be main influential factors in determining the distributional 
range of cephalopods.
