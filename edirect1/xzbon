profiles were comparable with existing treatments. Studies reporting the use of 
focal cryotherapy suggested that incontinence rates may be better than for 
whole-gland treatment. Data on AS, salvage treatment and other ablative 
therapies were too limited. The cost-effectiveness analysis confirmed the 
uncertainty from the clinical review and that there is no technology which 
appears superior, on the basis of current evidence, in terms of average 
cost-effectiveness. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest that a number 
of ablative techniques are worthy of further research.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were the quantity and quality of the data 
available on cancer-related outcomes and dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that there is insufficient evidence to form 
any clear recommendations on the use of ablative therapies in order to influence 
current clinical practice. Research efforts in the use of ablative therapies in 
the management of prostate cancer should now be concentrated on the performance 
of RCTs and the generation of standardised outcomes.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that living conditions at birth play a 
role in medical conditions later in life. Population-based studies from the 
Northern Hemisphere have shown that persons born in the spring or summer are at 
greater risk of committing suicide. A statistical correlation with light 
availability at birth has been observed in past research, but the cause remains 
unknown. Greenland is one of the most extreme of natural human habitats with 
regard to seasonal changes in light. The combination of rapid social changes and 
reliable population statistics offers a unique opportunity to make comparisons 
between persons born into a Traditional Lifestyle and those born into a Modern 
Lifestyle. The aim of this work was to assess whether season of birth differed 
between suicide victims born into an old or into a modern lifestyle.
METHODS: Official population and mortality registers were used. Suicide victims 
born (1903-1950) into the Traditional Lifestyle were compared with those born 
into the Modern Lifestyle (1961-1980). Rayleigh's test for circular 
distributions was used to assess the season of birth in suicide victims. Data 
regarding season of birth in the general population were collected.
RESULTS: Persons born in March-June in the Traditional Lifestyle were much less 
likely to commit suicide than those born during other periods of the year. This 
is contrary to the findings of other studies. The seasonal differences had 
disappeared for those born into the Modern Lifestyle. The suicide rate increased 
from very low rates to about 140 suicides/100 000 person-years in the 1980s.
CONCLUSIONS: The reason behind a variation in season of birth in suicide victims 
born into the old lifestyle is unknown. It is also unknown why the seasonal 
difference had disappeared with modern lifestyle. Possible influence of 
artificial light, nutrition, microbiota and seasonal infections are discussed. 
The underlying causes behind suicides may be different in traditional and modern 
Greenland.

Situated phenomenology and biological systems: Eastern and Western synthesis.

Phenomenology was born with the mission to give foundations for science of 
experience and to open consciousness to scientific study. The influence of 
phenomenology initiated in the works of Husserl and continued in a wide range of 
works of others was immense, but mainly within the confines of philosophy and 
the humanities. The actual attempts to develop a scientific discipline of the 
study of consciousness and to carry out research on cognition and consciousness 
were always based on the methods of traditional science in which elimination of 
the subjective has been always a primary tenet. Thus, focus was mainly on 
neurological correlates of conscious phenomena. The present paper is an attempt 
to initiate an extension and revision of phenomenological methodology with the 
use of philosophical and scientific experience and knowledge accumulated in a 
century of inquiry and research in relevant disciplines. The question which 
disciplines are relevant is crucial and our answer is innovative. The range of 
disciplines involved here is from information science and studies of 
computation, up to cultural psychology and the studies of philosophical 
traditions of the East. Concepts related to information and computation studies 
provide a general conceptual framework free from the limitations of particular 
languages and of linguistic analysis. This conceptual framework is extending the 
original perspective of phenomenology to issues of modern technology and 
science. Cultural psychology gives us tools to root out what in phenomenology 
was considered universal for humanity, but was a result of European 
ethnocentrism. Most important here is the contrast between individualistic and 
collectivistic cultural determinants of consciousness. Finally, philosophical 
tradition of the East gives alternatives in seeking solutions for fundamental 
problems. This general outline of the research methodology is illustrated by an 
example of its use when phenomenology is studied within the conceptual framework 
of information.

BACKGROUND: The rate of pacemaker implantation is rising. Given that the life 
expectancy of the population is projected to increase, a large number of elderly 
patients are likely to be implanted in the future. As pacemaker batteries can 
last for 8-10years, an increasing number of pacemaker recipients will require 
replacement of their devices when they become nonagenarians.
AIMS: To analyse the short- and long-term outcomes after device replacement in 
nonagenarians.
METHODS: Patients aged≥90years referred to a tertiary centre for pacemaker 
replacement from January 2004 to July 2014 were included retrospectively. 
Clinical follow-up data were obtained from clinical visits or telephone 
interviews with patients or their families. The primary clinical endpoint was 
total mortality. Secondary endpoints included early and delayed 
procedure-related complications and predictive risk factors for total mortality.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included (mean age 93.3±2.9years at time of 
pacemaker replacement). Mean procedure duration was 35.7±17.2minutes. Mean 
hospital stay was 2.2±1.1days. One patient died from a perioperative 
complication. Thirty-seven patients (59.7%) died during a median follow-up of 
22.1months (interquartile range, 11.8-39.8months). Survival rates were 84.2% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 71.8-91.5%) at 1year, 66.9% (95% CI 51.8-78.2%) at 
2years and 22.7% (95% CI 10.6-37.7%) at 5years. Atrial fibrillation (hazard 
ratio 2.47, 95% CI 1.1-5.6) and non-physiological pacing (i.e. VVI pacing in 
patients in sinus rhythm) (hazard ratio 2.20, 95% CI 1.0-4.9) were predictors of 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Pacemaker replacement in nonagenarians is a safe and 
straightforward procedure. These data suggest that procedures can be performed 
securely in this old and frail population, with patients living for a median of 
30months afterwards.

Economic aspects of infertility care: a challenge for researchers and 
clinicians.

Infertility care has improved remarkably over the last few decades and has 
received growing attention from health care providers. Several treatments, 
including expensive options such as Assisted Reproductive Techniques, are now 
widely available for routine clinical use. In most cases, adoption of these 
treatments has occurred without robust cost-effective analyses. IVF for 
unexplained infertility and ICSI in the absence of semen abnormalities are two 
examples of this gradual technology creep. More in-depth economic analyses in 
the field of infertility are undoubtedly warranted. However, performing these 
analyses is challenging because infertility care poses a number of unique 
challenges. Studies of cost-effectiveness are open to criticism because there is 
a lack of consensus about the outcomes of choice and the appropriate 
perspective. The use of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) to allow comparisons 
with other clinical conditions is also controversial because the value 
associated with infertility care cannot be easily captured in QALYs. Moreover, 
their use triggers the crucial question of whose QALYs merit consideration-an 
individual's, a couple's or a child's. In conclusion, economic analysis in 
infertility represents a peculiar but crucial challenge. If management of 
infertility is to become an integral part of publicly or privately funded health 
care systems worldwide, better quality data and a shared vision about the costs 
and benefits of infertility treatments are needed.

In the different types of children's hypercholesterolemia, some severe inherited 
monogenic forms, transmitted as a dominant trait, carry a high risk of early 
cardiovascular events in young adults and a decrease in life expectancy, 
warranting the initiation of a preventive cholesterol-lowering treatment early 
in childhood. As in adult patients, statins are the first-line drugs. The 
purpose of this article is to review the existing recommendations for their 
indications in children, their benefits, their tolerance, as well as their 
prescription and monitoring modalities.

Haemophilia is a congenital coagulation defect brought about by the deficiency 
or lack of coagulation factor IX. The prevalence of coronary artery disease and 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is lower among haemophiliacs than in the normal 
population. However, with the administration of factor concentrate, average life 
expectancy can now extend to as long as 70 years in patients with haemophilia, 
and this in turn is leading to an increase in the prevalence of cardiac diseases 
among this population. Data regarding a treatment protocol for ACS and 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with congenital coagulation 
defects is limited. We report a 41-year-old male patient with haemophilia B who 
presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and on whom PCI was 
performed following monitoring of factor IX levels. The patient had no 
cardiovascular risk factor except smoking.

OBJECTIVE: Pemetrexed plus carboplatin offers survival advantage in first line 
treatment of advanced lung cancer patients with performance status of 2. We 
estimated the cost-effectiveness of this combined regimen compared to pemetrexed 
alone in a Brazilian population.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on a randomized phase 
III trial in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ECOG 
performance status of 2 (PS2), comparing doublet regimen pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin with pemetrexed alone. The perspective adopted was the public health 
care sector over a three-year period. Direct medical costs and survival time 
were calculated from patient-level data and utility values were extracted from 
the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainties in 
the results.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The combined regimen pemetrexed plus carboplatin yielded 
a gain of 0.16 life year (LY) and 0.12 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
compared to pemetrexed alone. The total cost was 17,674.31 USD for the combined 
regimen and 15,722.39 USD for pemetrexed alone. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $12,016.09 per LY gained and $15,732.05 per 
QALY gained. The factors with the greatest impact on the ICER are pemetrexed 
price and the time to progression utility value. The cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve showed an upper 90% probability of pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin being cost-effective with a threshold between two and three GDP per 
capita. Our study suggests superiority of the combined pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin regimen in terms of efficacy as well as cost-effectiveness in 
advanced NSCLC patients with a poor performance status of 2.

PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term outcomes among a population of very old patients 
(≥80years) after nonelective intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
METHODS: A retrospective study of very old patients admitted to a mixed ICU 
between 2006 and 2012 was conducted. A detailed description was made; functional 
status was assessed through the modified Rankin Scale and quality of life 
through EQ-5D-3L. Follow-up results are compared between 3 groups: very old with 
"old" (66-79 years) and "non-old" (≤65years) patients.
RESULTS: A total of 278 very old patients were admitted into the ICU 
representing 10.3% of admissions. The mean (SD) Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score II was 61 (16) predicting a hospital mortality of 70%, and the observed 
hospital mortality was 53%. Two-year survival rate was 38%. Of the 158 patients 
who survived in the ICU, 51 were evaluated in the outpatient clinic, and of 
those, 25 (51%) had already resumed previous functional activity. Evaluation 
through the modified Rankin Scale showed that 29 (60%) remained independent in 
their daily activities. When comparing the 3 groups, several differences were 
observed between theme, with the oldest groups (>80years) reporting more 
problems in motility, self-care, and usual activities. The respondent's 
self-rated health through the median visual analog scale score on the day of the 
outpatient clinic appointment decreased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: For those who survive, return to previous functional activity was 
likely. Long-term survival and quality of life achieved afterward were 
translated in more than a year of perfect health status gained.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic benefits of microsurgery for unruptured brain AVM 
remain unclear.
METHODS: A series of 97 microsurgically resected unruptured brain AVM was 
analyzed in terms of postoperative morbidity and lifetime loss of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). For comparison, the natural risk of becoming 
disabled was modeled on the basis of published data.
RESULTS: Discharge morbidity was recorded in 11 of the 69 of Spetzler-Martin 
(SM) grade 1 and 2 AVMs (16 %), eight of 22 (36 %) grade 3, and four of six 
grade 4 (67 %), permanent morbidity >mRS 1 in 3 (4.3 %) grade 1 and 2, four (18 
%) grade 3, and three (50 %) grade 4. Treatment inflicted loss of QALY amounted 
to 0.5 years for SM grade 1-2, 2.5 years grade 3, 7.3 years for grade 4. For the 
SM grades 1 and 2, the treatment-related loss of 0.5 QALY was met by the natural 
course after 2.7-4.3 years. For the Spetzler-Martin grades 3 and 4, the 
treatment-induced loss QALY was not met by the natural risk within a foreseeable 
time. Permanent morbidity and treatment inflicted loss of QALY of patients 
younger than 39 years was lower than that of older patients (7 vs. 15 % and 1.0 
vs. 2.1 QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgically managed SM grades 1 and 2 fared better than the 
modeled natural course but grades 3 and 4 AVM did not benefit from surgery. 
Younger patients appear to fare more favorably than older patients.

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein involved in the biogenesis 
of Fe-S-cluster-containing proteins and consequently in the functionality of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain. Similar to other proteins that regulate 
mitochondrial respiration, severe frataxin deficiency leads to pathology in 
humans--Friedreich's ataxia, a life-threatening neurodegenerative disorder--and 
to developmental arrest in the nematode C. elegans. Interestingly, partial 
frataxin depletion extends C. elegans lifespan, and a similar anti-aging effect 
is prompted by reduced expression of other mitochondrial regulatory proteins 
from yeast to mammals. The beneficial adaptive responses to mild mitochondrial 
stress are still largely unknown and, if characterized, may suggest novel 
potential targets for the treatment of human mitochondria-associated, 
age-related disorders. Here we identify mitochondrial autophagy as an 
evolutionarily conserved response to frataxin silencing, and show for the first 
time that, similar to mammals, mitophagy is activated in C. elegans in response 
to mitochondrial stress in a pdr-1/Parkin-, pink-1/Pink-, and 
dct-1/Bnip3-dependent manner. The induction of mitophagy is part of a 
hypoxia-like, iron starvation response triggered upon frataxin depletion and 
causally involved in animal lifespan extension. We also identify non-overlapping 
hif-1 upstream (HIF-1-prolyl-hydroxylase) and downstream (globins) regulatory 
genes mediating lifespan extension upon frataxin and iron depletion. Our 
findings indicate that mitophagy induction is part of an adaptive iron 
starvation response induced as a protective mechanism against mitochondrial 
stress, thus suggesting novel potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment 
of mitochondrial-associated, age-related disorders.

A major goal of aging research now is to find pharmacological manipulations in 
healthspan extension. Icariin is a flavonol isolated from medicinal herbal 
tonics. We have previously reported that icariin extended the healthspan of 
invertebrate models. Here, we showed that long-term treatment with icariin 
starting at 12months of age extended healthspan and mean lifespan in C57BL/6 
mice. In all our assays associated with healthspan, such as behavioral tests and 
bone density analysis, we found that icariin boosted healthy features in mice. 
We also presented data indicating that such beneficial effects of icariin were 
due to at least two mechanisms: reduced oxidative stress indicated by the 
induction of antioxidant protein superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the 
decrease of oxidative marker malondialdehyde (MDA); maintained the genomic 
stability indicated by a reduction in DNA double-stranded breaks and 
down-regulation of DNA damage response genes. Our results indicated that 
icariin, a safe and widely used natural flavonol, extended healthspan and 
maintained genomic stability in a mammalian system.

BACKGROUND: Cost-utility analysis using the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
as an outcome measure to inform healthcare resource allocation is becoming more 
common. The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) enables the calculation of utility 
values in children. Children were involved throughout its development to ensure 
it is child centred.
AIM: To determine whether the CHU9D is responsive to the changing components of 
the dmfs+DMFS index score in children receiving dental care over a 1-year 
period.
DESIGN: The study sample comprised children aged 6 to 9 years old who were 
enrolled in a split-mouth, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial. All 
children had a comprehensive clinical examination including radiographs and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the CHU9D at baseline 
and 1 year. Descriptive statistics was followed by bivariate analyses before 
effect sizes were calculated. A negative binomial model was fitted to assess 
whether the utility score predicted the components of decayed and filled teeth 
(combined primary and permanent teeth).
RESULTS: Eighty (92%) children completed the CHU9D at baseline and follow-up. 
They presented with a mean baseline d3mfs+D3MFS of 6.7 (SD = 7.1), which rose to 
7.3 (SD = 7.0) at follow-up. The mean CHU9D score improved from 0.88 to 0.90 
from baseline to follow-up. No statistically significant relationships were 
found between caries status and the CHU9D score.
CONCLUSION: The CHU9D was found to be unresponsive to the changing components of 
dental caries experience.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine 
the overall effect of resistance training (RT) on measures of muscular strength 
in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: Controlled trials with parallel-group-design were identified from 
computerized literature searching and citation tracking performed until August 
2014. Two reviewers independently screened for eligibility and assessed the 
quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias-tool. For each study, 
mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes based on between-group 
comparisons using post-intervention data. Subgroup analysis was conducted based 
on differences in study design.
RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria; all had a moderate to high 
risk of bias. Pooled data showed that knee extension, knee flexion and leg press 
strength were significantly greater in PD patients who undertook RT compared to 
control groups with or without interventions. Subgroups were: RT vs. 
control-without-intervention, RT vs. control-with-intervention, 
RT-with-other-form-of-exercise vs. control-without-intervention, 
RT-with-other-form-of-exercise vs. control-with-intervention. Pooled subgroup 
analysis showed that RT combined with aerobic/balance/stretching exercise 
resulted in significantly greater knee extension, knee flexion and leg press 
strength compared with no-intervention. Compared to treadmill or balance 
exercise it resulted in greater knee flexion, but not knee extension or leg 
press strength. RT alone resulted in greater knee extension and flexion strength 
compared to stretching, but not in greater leg press strength compared to 
no-intervention.
DISCUSSION: Overall, the current evidence suggests that exercise interventions 
that contain RT may be effective in improving muscular strength in people with 
PD compared with no exercise. However, depending on muscle group and/or training 
dose, RT may not be superior to other exercise types. Interventions which 
combine RT with other exercise may be most effective. Findings should be 
interpreted with caution due to the relatively high risk of bias of most 
studies.

The study assessed whether the auditory reference provided by a music scale 
could improve spatial exploration of a standard musical instrument keyboard in 
right-brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect. As performing music 
scales involves the production of predictable successive pitches, the 
expectation of the subsequent note may facilitate patients to explore a larger 
extension of space in the left affected side, during the production of music 
scales from right to left. Eleven right-brain-damaged stroke patients with left 
spatial neglect, 12 patients without neglect, and 12 age-matched healthy 
participants played descending scales on a music keyboard. In a counterbalanced 
design, the participants' exploratory performance was assessed while producing 
scales in three feedback conditions: With congruent sound, no-sound, or random 
sound feedback provided by the keyboard. The number of keys played and the 
timing of key press were recorded. Spatial exploration by patients with left 
neglect was superior with congruent sound feedback, compared to both Silence and 
Random sound conditions. Both the congruent and incongruent sound conditions 
were associated with a greater deceleration in all groups. The frame provided by 
the music scale improves exploration of the left side of space, contralateral to 
the right hemisphere, damaged in patients with left neglect. Performing a scale 
with congruent sounds may trigger at some extent preserved auditory and spatial 
multisensory representations of successive sounds, thus influencing the time 
course of space scanning, and ultimately resulting in a more extensive spatial 
exploration. These findings offer new perspectives also for the rehabilitation 
of the disorder.

INTRODUCTION: Positive health, dignity, and prevention (PHDP) interventions 
target people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV) to promote well-being and prevent 
onward transmission. Concern that increased life expectancy and improved 
well-being would lead to increased risky sexual behaviour and subsequent HIV 
transmission motivated researchers to test novel strategies to support treatment 
adherence, encourage safer sex, STI treatment and partner testing, prevention of 
mother to child transmission, and support uptake of family planning.
METHODS: We assessed the number and type of PHDP messages delivered to PLHIV 
before and after the implementation of an educational intervention for health 
providers combined with the distribution of visual job aids and monthly 
technical assistance.
RESULTS: From April 21, 2013 to March 20, 2014, we documented 54,731 clinical 
encounters at three rural health centres in Zambézia province, Mozambique from 
9,248 unique patients. The percentage of patients who received all seven PHDP 
messages during their last three visits was 1.9% pre-intervention vs. 13.6% 
post- intervention (p=<0.001). Younger patients (25 years vs. 35) and those with 
a recent HIV diagnosis (two weeks vs. two years) had higher odds of receiving 
any PHDP message (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.22 and 2.79, respectively). Patients >59 
days late collecting medications were not more likely to receive adherence 
messages than adherent patients (p=0.17).
DISCUSSION: Targeting HIV prevention efforts to PLHIV is an effective HIV 
prevention approach to eliminate HIV transmission. Despite intensive training 
and support, PHDP message delivery remained unacceptably low in rural 
Mozambique. Patients at high risk for treatment abandonment were not more likely 
to be counselled about adherence and support measures, something that needs to 
be addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: We need to develop novel strategies to motivate health care 
providers to deliver these messages more consistently to all patients and 
develop a system that assists counsellors and clinicians to quickly and 
effectively determine which messages should be delivered.

Real-world performance, durability and reliability of microinverters are 
critical concerns for microinverter-equipped photovoltaic systems. We conducted 
a data-driven study of the thermal performance of 24 new microinverters (Enphase 
M215) connected to 8 different brands of PV modules on dual-axis trackers at the 
Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) SunFarm at Case Western Reserve 
University, based on minute by minute power and thermal data from the 
microinverters and PV modules along with insolation and environmental data from 
July through October 2013. The analysis shows the strengths of the associations 
of microinverter temperature with ambient temperature, PV module temperature, 
irradiance and AC power of the PV systems. The importance of the covariates are 
rank ordered. A multiple regression model was developed and tested based on 
stable solar noon-time data, which gives both an overall function that predicts 
the temperature of microinverters under typical local conditions, and 
coefficients adjustments reecting refined prediction of the microinverter 
temperature connected to the 8 brands of PV modules in the study. The model 
allows for prediction of internal temperature for the Enphase M215 given similar 
climatic condition and can be expanded to predict microinverter temperature in 
fixed-rack and roof-top PV systems. This study is foundational in that similar 
models built on later stage data in the life of a device could reveal potential 
influencing factors in performance degradation.

Endothelial Snail Regulates Capillary Branching Morphogenesis via Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3 Expression.

Vascular branching morphogenesis is activated and maintained by several 
signaling pathways. Among them, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 
(VEGFR2) signaling is largely presented in arteries, and VEGFR3 signaling is in 
veins and capillaries. Recent reports have documented that Snail, a well-known 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition protein, is expressed in endothelial cells, 
where it regulates sprouting angiogenesis and embryonic vascular development. 
Here, we identified Snail as a regulator of VEGFR3 expression during capillary 
branching morphogenesis. Snail was dramatically upregulated in sprouting vessels 
in the developing retinal vasculature, including the leading-edged vessels and 
vertical sprouting vessels for capillary extension toward the deep retina. 
Results from in vitro functional studies demonstrate that Snail expression 
colocalized with VEGFR3 and upregulated VEGFR3 mRNA by directly binding to the 
VEGFR3 promoter via cooperating with early growth response protein-1. Snail 
knockdown in postnatal mice attenuated the formation of the deep capillary 
plexus, not only by impairing vertical sprouting vessels but also by 
downregulating VEGFR3 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that the 
Snail-VEGFR3 axis controls capillary extension, especially in vessels expressing 
VEGFR2 at low levels.

Australia.

Animals that have a long pre-reproductive adult stage often employ mechanisms 
that minimize aging over this period in order to preserve reproductive lifespan. 
In a remarkable exception, one tephritid fruit fly exhibits substantial 
pre-reproductive aging but then mitigates this aging during a diet-dependent 
transition to the reproductive stage, after which life expectancy matches that 
of newly emerged flies. Here, we ascertain the role of nutrients, sexual 
maturation and mating in mitigation of previous aging in female Queensland fruit 
flies. Flies were provided one of three diets: 'sugar', 'essential', or 
'yeast-sugar'. Essential diet contained sugar and micronutrients found in yeast 
but lacked maturation-enabling protein. At days 20 and 30, a subset of flies on 
the sugar diet were switched to essential or yeast-sugar diet, and some 
yeast-sugar fed flies were mated 10 days later. Complete mitigation of actuarial 
aging was only observed in flies that were switched to a yeast-sugar diet and 
mated, indicating that mating is key. Identifying the physiological processes 
associated with mating promise novel insights into repair mechanisms for aging.

Recent studies have highlighted the overexpression of mucin 1 (MUC1) in various 
epithelial carcinomas and its role in tumorigenesis. These mucins present a 
novel targeting opportunity for nanoparticle-mediated photothermal cancer 
treatments due to their unique antenna-like extracellular extension. In this 
study, MUC1 antibodies and albumin were immobilized onto the surface of gold 
nanorods using a "primer" of polydopamine (PD), a molecular mimic of catechol- 
and amine-rich mussel adhesive proteins. PD forms an adhesive platform for the 
deposition of albumin and MUC1 antibodies, achieving a surface that is stable, 
bioinert and biofunctional. Two-photon luminescence confocal and darkfield 
scattering imaging revealed targeting of MUC1-BSA-PD-NRs to MUC1+ MCF-7 breast 
cancer and SCC-15 squamous cell carcinoma cells lines. Treated cells were 
exposed to a laser encompassing the near-infrared AuNR longitudinal surface 
plasmon and assessed for photothermal ablation. MUC1-BSA-PD-NRs substantially 
decreased cell viability in photoirradiated MCF-7 cell lines vs. MUC1- 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (p < 0.005). Agents exhibited no cytotoxicity in 
the absence of photothermal treatment. The facile nature of the coating method, 
combined with targeting and photoablation efficacy, are attractive features of 
these candidate cancer nanotherapeutics.
