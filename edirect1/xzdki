screening and cancer care expenditure, and health state utilities were derived 
from the literature. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and costs 
were tracked over a lifetime horizon and discounted at 3% per year. Results are 
presented in 2020 US dollars, and we took a limited US healthcare perspective.
RESULTS: In the base case, screening resulted in 0.0055 more LYs, 0.0045 more 
QALYs, and $293 in additional expenditures for a cost per QALY gained of 
$65,076. In probabilistic analyses, screening resulted in a cost per QALY gained 
of <$50,000 and <$100,000 in 34% and 99% of simulations, respectively. In the 
threshold analysis, >25% of screen-detected PAC cases needed to be resectable 
for the cost per QALY gained with screening to be <$100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that risk-based PAC screening in patients with NOD is 
likely to be cost-effective in the United States if even a modest fraction 
(>25%) of screen-detected patients with PAC are resectable. Future studies 
should reassess the value of this intervention once clinical trial data become 
available.

Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus is a global public health problem accompanied by substantial 
comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. In this respect, CKD leading to 
uremia can be seen as a systemic disease with a critical impact on virtually all 
organ systems. Thus it is of particular importance to identify patients with 
incipient CKD and ongoing CKD progression, but the individual course of CKD is 
challenging to predict. Patterns of progression in persons with CKD include 
linear and nonlinear trajectories of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss. 
Kidney function can also remain stable for years, especially in the elderly. In 
particular, one-fifth of individuals show a substantial GFR decline in the 
absence of high albuminuria (nonproteinuric CKD), rendering albuminuria less 
suitable for predicting the progression in such individuals.

Precision medicine in Fabry disease.

Interdisciplinary Fabry Center Münster, University Hospital Münster, Münster, 
Germany.

Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
mutations in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, leading to a deficiency in 
α-galactosidase A. The lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, primarily 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form, globotriaosylsphingosine 
(lyso-Gb3), results in progressive renal failure, cardiomyopathy associated with 
cardiac arrhythmia and recurrent cerebrovascular events, significantly limiting 
life expectancy in affected patients. In male patients, a definitive diagnosis 
of FD involves demonstrating a GLA deficiency in leucocytes. In females, because 
of the potential high residual enzymatic activity, the diagnostic gold standard 
requires molecular genetic analyses. The current treatment options for FD 
include recombinant enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) with intravenous 
agalsidase-α (0.2 mg/kg body weight) or agalsidase-β (1 mg/kg body weight) every 
2 weeks as well as an oral pharmacological chaperone (migalastat 123 mg every 
other day) that selectively and reversibly binds to the active sites of amenable 
mutant forms of the GLA enzyme. These therapies facilitate cellular Gb3 
clearance and an overall improvement of disease burden. However, ERT can lead to 
infusion-associated reactions, as well as the formation of neutralizing 
anti-drug antibodies in ∼40% of all ERT-treated males, leading to an attenuation 
of therapy efficacy. This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis 
and interdisciplinary clinical management of FD and discusses the therapeutic 
options, with a special focus on precision medicine, accounting for individual 
variability in genetic mutations, Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 levels, allowing physicians 
to predict more accurately which prevention and treatment strategy is best for 
which patient.

Microbubbles are typically 0.5-10 μm in size. Their size tends to make it easier 
for medication delivery mechanisms to navigate the body by allowing them to be 
swallowed more easily. The gas included in the microbubble is surrounded by a 
membrane that may consist of biocompatible biopolymers, polymers, surfactants, 
proteins, lipids, or a combination thereof. One of the most effective 
implementation techniques for tiny bubbles is to apply them as a drug carrier 
that has the potential to activate ultrasound (US); this allows the drug to be 
released by US. Microbubbles are often designed to preserve and secure medicines 
or substances before they have reached a certain area of concern and, finally, 
US is used to disintegrate microbubbles, triggering site-specific 
leakage/release of biologically active drugs. They have excellent therapeutic 
potential in a wide range of common diseases. In this article, we discussed 
microbubbles and their advantageous medicinal uses in the treatment of certain 
prevalent disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetic condition, renal defects, and finally, their 
use in the treatment of various forms of cancer as well as their incorporation 
with nanoparticles. Using microbubble technology as a novel carrier, the ability 
to prevent and eradicate prevalent diseases has strengthened the promise of 
effective care to improve patient well-being and life expectancy.

Comment in
    Radiol Imaging Cancer. 2022 Mar;4(2):e229003.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause 
of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. 
Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths 
in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with 
regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being 
diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging 
recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the 
greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical 
options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more 
screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers 
than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to 
have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than 
unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an 
unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women 
in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age 
limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening 
should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional 
imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and 
overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more 
frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. 
Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 
40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

INTRODUCTION: While the need for palliative care for people living with dementia 
has widely been recognised, they continue to be a disadvantaged group when it 
comes to timely initiation, and controversies remain regarding appropriate 
timing, or what elements constitute high quality palliative care early in the 
disease trajectory. To date, no literature review has summarised this debate or 
offered insights. The aim of this scoping review is to provide a general 
overview of research regarding palliative care in mild or moderate dementia, to 
identify existing controversies, and to examine what are key components of 
palliative care in dementia, specifically when initiated earlier in the disease 
trajectory.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Consistent with recent guidelines and the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews, we carried out a search for academic literature in PubMed, CINAHL, 
EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science; on 5 November 2019 and an 
updated search on 2 February 2021. We will include studies with different study 
designs published in English over the last decade that focused on palliative 
care in early stages of dementia. We will include models targeting at least one 
outcome domain of palliative care (physical, psychological, social or spiritual) 
and advance care planning, and will exclude hospice models with limited 
prognosis similar to the requirements in the USA. We will report study 
characteristics and quality. We aim to apply narrative synthesis techniques to 
develop a theoretical model of how, for whom and why palliative care can be 
relevant in early stages of dementia, and what are facilitators and barriers. We 
anticipate to also describe if and how the concept of (early) palliative care in 
dementia changed across time and studies.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical review required. Results will identify 
research gaps and lay out basic principles for conceptualising palliative care 
in early stages of dementia.

Energy efficiency and financial depth nexus revisited: does the choice of 
instrumental variable and measure of financial depth matter?

This study examines the effect of finance on energy efficiency in Africa, 
addressing two fundamental empirical issues in the energy-finance literature: 
(1) simultaneous modelling of efficiency estimates and determinants of 
efficiency and (2) two-way endogeneity problem with income and financial depth. 
I apply the endogenous stochastic frontier method. Life expectancy at birth 
instruments for income while religion, latitude of capital city and legal system 
origin instrument for financial depth. Estimated efficiency in electricity 
consumption is between 9 and 16%, which is quite low, suggesting greater 
potential to improve electricity consumption efficiency. Without considering the 
level of development, the result shows that finding a statistically significant 
negative effect of financial depth on energy inefficiency depends on the choice 
of instrument and not the indicator of financial depth. Using country latitude 
and legal system origin as instruments produce robust statistically significant 
negative effect for all the indicators of financial depth, but high monetisation 
of the economy and supply of loanable funds exert the greatest effect, 
recommending between 0.069 and 0.096% reduction in inefficiency for every 1% 
increase in these indicators. However, both the choice of instruments and 
indicator of financial depth matter, when I consider income level. I discuss the 
policy implications.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the differences 
in life expectancy and causes of death after primary intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) relative to general population controls.
METHODS: In a population-based setting, 963 patients from Northern Ostrobothnia 
who had their first-ever ICH between 1993 and 2008 were compared with a cohort 
of 2884 sex- and age-matched controls in terms of dates and causes of death as 
extracted from the Causes of Death Register kept by Statistics Finland and valid 
up to the end of 2017.
RESULTS: Of our 963 patients, 781 died during the follow-up time (mortality 
81.1%). Cerebrovascular disease was the most common cause of death for these 
patients, 37.3% compared with 8.2% amongst the controls. The most common reasons 
for cerebrovascular mortality in the ICH patients were late sequelae of ICH in 
12.8% (controls 0%) and new bleeding in 10.6% (controls 1.0%). The long-term 
survivors had a smaller ICH volume (median 12 ml) than those patients who died 
within 3 months (median 39 ml). The mortality rate of ICH patients during a 
follow-up between 12 and 24 years was still higher than that of their controls 
(hazard ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.58-2.74, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Very long-term ICH survivors have a constant excess mortality 
relative to controls even 10 years after the index event. A significantly larger 
proportion of patients died of cerebrovascular causes and fewer because of 
cancer relative to the controls.

The importance of considering age when quantifying wild animals' welfare.

Wild animals experience different challenges and opportunities as they mature, 
and this variety of experiences can lead to different levels of welfare 
characterizing the day-to-day lives of individuals of different ages. At the 
same time, most wild animals who are born do not survive to adulthood. 
Individuals who die as juveniles do not simply experience a homogeneous fraction 
of the lifetimes of older members of their species; rather, their truncated 
lives may be characterized by very different levels of welfare. Here, I propose 
the concept of welfare expectancy as a framework for quantifying wild animal 
welfare at a population level, given individual-level data on average welfare 
with respect to age. This concept fits conveniently alongside methods of 
analysis already used in population ecology, such as demographic sensitivity 
analysis, and is applicable to evaluating the welfare consequences of human 
interventions and natural pressures that disproportionately affect individuals 
of different ages. In order to understand better and improve the state of wild 
animal welfare, more attention should be directed towards young animals and the 
particular challenges they face.

Aging and immunity are inextricably linked and many genes that extend life span 
also enhance immunoresistance. However, it remains unclear whether 
longevity-enhancing factors modulate immunity and longevity by discrete or 
shared mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans 
pro-longevity factor, NHR-49, also promotes resistance against Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa but modulates immunity and longevity distinctly. NHR-49 expression 
increases upon germline ablation, an intervention that extends life span, but 
was lowered by Pseudomonas infection. The immunosusceptibility induced by nhr-49 
loss of function was rescued by neuronal NHR-49 alone, whereas the longevity 
diminution was rescued by expression in multiple somatic tissues. The 
well-established NHR-49 target genes, acs-2 and fmo-2, were also differentially 
regulated following germline elimination or Pseudomonas exposure. Interestingly, 
neither gene conferred immunity toward Gram-negative Pseudomonas, unlike their 
known functions against gram-positive pathogens. Instead, genes encoding 
antimicrobial factors and xenobiotic-response proteins upregulated by NHR-49 
contributed to resistance against Pseudomonas. Thus, NHR-49 is differentially 
regulated by interventions that bring about long-term changes (life span 
extension) versus short-term stress (pathogen exposure) and in response it 
orchestrates discrete outputs, including pathogen-specific transcriptional 
programs.

mPPI: a database extension to visualize structural interactome in a one-to-many

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases with structural information are 
useful to investigate biological functions at both systematic and atomic levels. 
However, most existing PPI databases only curate binary interactome. From the 
perspective of the display and function of PPI, as well as the structural 
binding interface, the related database and resources are summarized. We 
developed a database extension, named mPPI, for PPI structural visualization. 
Comparing with the existing structural interactomes that curate resolved PPI 
conformation in pairs, mPPI can visualize target protein and its multiple 
interactors simultaneously, which facilitates multi-target drug discovery and 
structure prediction of protein macro-complexes. By employing a protein-protein 
docking algorithm, mPPI largely extends the coverage of structural interactome 
from experimentally resolved complexes. mPPI is designed to be a customizable 
and convenient plugin for PPI databases. It possesses wide potential 
applications for various PPI databases, and it has been used for a 
neurodegenerative disease-related PPI database as demonstration. Scripts and 
implementation guidelines of mPPI are documented at the database tool website.

IMPORTANCE: Knowledge of the health challenges and mortality in people with 
intellectual disability (ID) should guide health policies and practices in 
contemporary society.
OBJECTIVE: To examine premature mortality in individuals with ID.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based longitudinal cohort 
study obtained data from several national health care, education, and population 
registers in Sweden. Two registers were used to identify individuals with ID: 
the National Patient Register and the Halmstad University Register on Pupils 
With Intellectual Disability. Two cohorts were created: cohort 1 comprised young 
adults (born between 1980 and 1991) with mild ID, and cohort 2 comprised 
individuals (born between 1932 and 2013) with mild ID or moderate to profound 
ID; each cohort had matched reference cohorts. Data analyses were conducted 
between June 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021.
EXPOSURES: Mild or moderate to profound ID.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall (all-cause) 
mortality, and the secondary outcomes were cause-specific mortality and 
potentially avoidable mortality.
RESULTS: Cohort 1 included 13 541 young adults with mild ID (mean [SD] age at 
death, 24.53 [3.66] years; 7826 men [57.8%]), and its matched reference cohort 
consisted of 135 410 individuals. Cohort 2 included 24 059 individuals with mild 
ID (mean [SD] age at death, 52.01 [16.88] years; 13 649 male individuals 
[56.7%]) and 26 602 individuals with moderate to profound ID (mean [SD] age at 
death, 42.16 [21.68] years; 15 338 male individuals [57.7%]); its matched 
reference cohorts consisted of 240 590 individuals with mild ID and 266 020 with 
moderate to profound ID. Young adults with mild ID had increased overall 
mortality risk compared with the matched reference cohort (odds ratio [OR], 
2.86; 95% CI, 2.33-3.50), specifically excess mortality in neoplasms (OR, 3.58; 
95% CI, 2.02-6.35), diseases of the nervous system (OR, 40.00; 95% CI, 
18.43-86.80) and circulatory system (OR, 9.24; 95% CI, 4.76-17.95). Among deaths 
that were amenable to health care (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 4.85-12.39), 55% were 
attributed to epilepsy. In cohort 2, increased risk of overall mortality was 
observed among both individuals with mild ID (OR, 6.21; 95% CI, 5.79-6.66) and 
moderate to profound ID (OR, 13.15; 95% CI, 12.52-13.81) compared with the 
matched reference cohorts. Those with moderate to profound ID had a higher risk 
in several cause-of-death categories compared with those with mild ID or the 
matched reference cohort. Adjustment for epilepsy and congenital malformations 
attenuated the associations. The relative risk of premature death was higher in 
women (OR, 6.23; 95% CI, 4.42-8.79) than in men (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.60), 
but the absolute risk of mortality was similar (0.9% for women vs 0.9% for men).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found excess premature mortality and high 
risk of deaths with causes that were potentially amenable to health care 
intervention among people with ID. This finding suggests that this patient 
population faces persistent health challenges and inequality in health care 
encounters.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review of literature on the clinical presentation, 
management and outcomes of pituitary apoplexy following gonadotrophic release 
hormone (GnRH) agonist administration for the treatment of prostate cancer.
METHODS: We used PRISMA guidelines for our systematic review and included all 
English language original articles on pituitary apoplexy following GnRH agonist 
administration among prostate cancer patients from Jan 1, 1995 to Dec 31, 2020. 
Data on patient demographics, prostate cancer type, Gleason score at diagnosis, 
history of pituitary adenoma, clinical presentation, GnRH agonist, interval to 
pituitary apoplexy, laboratory evaluation at admission, radiologic findings, 
treatment of pituitary apoplexy, time to surgery if performed, pathology 
findings, and clinical/hormonal outcomes were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with pituitary apoplexy met our inclusion criteria. 
The mean age of patients was 70 (60-83) years. Leuprolide was the most common 
used GnRH agonist, used in 61.9% of patients. Median duration to symptom onset 
was 5 h (few minutes to 6 months). Headache was reported by all patients 
followed by ophthalmoplegia (85.7%) and nausea/vomiting (71.4%). Three patients 
had blindness at presentation. Only 8 cases reported complete anterior pituitary 
hormone evaluation on presentation and the most common endocrine abnormality was 
FSH elevation. Tumor size was described only in 15 cases and the mean tumor size 
was 26.26 mm (18-48 mm). Suprasellar extension was the most common imaging 
finding seen in 7 patients. 71.4% of patients underwent pituitary surgery, while 
23.8% were managed conservatively. Interval between symptoms onset to pituitary 
surgery was 7 days (1-90 days). Gonadotroph adenoma was most common 
histopathologic finding. Clinical resolution was comparable, while endocrine 
outcomes were variable among patients with conservative vs surgical management.
CONCLUSION: Although the use of GnRH agonists is relatively safe, it can rarely 
lead to pituitary apoplexy especially in patients with pre-existing pituitary 
adenoma. Physicians should be aware of this complication as it can be life 
threatening. A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in treating 
individuals with pituitary apoplexy.

OBJECTIVE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive debilitating 
neurodegenerative disease with a life expectancy of 3-5 years from initial 
symptoms. We report a case of ALS who received autologous adipose-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) and was followed up for 7 years.
CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old man noticed weakness of his legs, difficulties on 
going down the stairs and coughing during eating in 2009. After complete 
workout, a diagnosis of ALS was confirmed. His ALS Functional Rating Scale-R 
(ALSFS-R) was 43. Symptoms rapidly progressed and he coughed and choked during 
eating. Starting in 2013, the patient received a total of six intravenous 
infusions of autologous ADSC. Changes in electromyogram, nerve conduction, and 
ALSFS-R were assessed.
RESULTS: Soon after the administration, he noticed that he did not cough during 
conversation or eating food. Although he had difficulty in walking down the 
stairs, he remained well without coughing, dysarthria, or dysphagia. His ALSFS-R 
increased up to 45. Fascicular potentials were not detected in any muscles 
examined including trapezius muscle and rectus femoris muscles. The patient was 
well for 7 years after ADSC therapy by the time of this report and more than 10 
years from the time of onset.
CONCLUSIONS: The present case suggests that autologous ADSC can be administered 
safely and may be potentially useful in patients with ALS. Further 
investigations are warranted in order for the results to be generalized to other 
ALS patients.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease requiring prolonged 
treatment. New biologic therapies require long-term evaluation to assess the 
durability of their efficacy and safety profiles over time.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of risankizumab (RZB) 
for the treatment of psoriasis.
METHODS: LIMMitless is an ongoing, phase III, open-label extension study 
evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of RZB in adults with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis following multiple phase II/III studies. 
This analysis assessed efficacy through 172 weeks of continuous RZB treatment by 
examining the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 90% or 100% improvement in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 and PASI 100), static Physician's 
Global Assessment of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) and Dermatology Life 
Quality Index of no effect on quality of life (DLQI 0/1). Safety was assessed by 
recording adverse events (AEs) through the data cutoff date. The study is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT03047395).
RESULTS: Of 955 patients randomized to RZB 150 mg in the base studies, 897 
patients continued into LIMMitless; 799 patients were still receiving treatment 
in LIMMitless at the time of data cutoff for this analysis. After 172 weeks of 
continuous RZB treatment, 85·5% of patients achieved PASI 90, 54·4% achieved 
PASI 100, 85·2% achieved sPGA 0/1, and 78·4% achieved DLQI 0/1 using modified 
nonresponder imputation. Rates of AEs leading to discontinuation and AEs of 
safety interest were low with long-term treatment and comparable with those 
identified in the base studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term continuous RZB was well tolerated and showed 
high and durable efficacy over 172 weeks.

The important increase in life expectancy of adult patients with congenital 
heart disease (ACHD) has generated new challenges, including arrhythmias that 
represent one of the main late complications. Reentrant atrial arrhythmias are 
by far the main mechanism encountered, and catheter ablation has been now 
presented as a first-line therapy in this patient population. The number of 
procedures is expected to continuously increase year after year. The 
heterogeneity and complexity of phenotypes encountered require these cases to be 
performed by highly experienced operators, in specialized centers with 
multidisciplinary competencies. A thorough knowledge and understanding of 
anatomic specificities, vascular access issues, and main circuits encountered 
according to underlying phenotype is essential. Acute success rates have 
significantly improved and are now excellent, but recurrences remain a common 
issue, with different mechanisms or circuits frequently encountered. 
Observational data have suggested the interest of systematically targeting all 
inducible atrial arrhythmias, whether previously documented or not, and a lot of 
hope and research is based on the prediction of arrhythmia substrate before 
arrhythmia development by imaging or electroanatomic mapping to deliver a 
prophylactic patient tailored ablation approach. In this review, we summarize 
those different points in the most common or distinctive defects to offer a 
didactic overview of atrial flutter catheter ablation in ACHD patients.

OBJECTIVES: The Quality in Acute Stroke Care (QASC) protocol is a 
multidisciplinary approach to implement evidence-based treatment after acute 
stroke that reduces death and disability. This study sought to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of implementing the QASC protocol across Australia, from a 
healthcare and a societal perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to reflect 
one-year outcomes post-stroke, aligned with the stroke severity categories of 
the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Decision analysis compared outcomes following 
implementation of the QASC protocol versus no implementation. Population data 
were extracted from Australian databases and data inputs regarding stroke 
incidence, costs, and utilities were drawn from published sources. The analysis 
assumed a progressive uptake and efficacy of the QASC protocol over five years. 
Health benefits and costs were discounted by 5% annually. The cost of each year 
lived by an Australian, from a societal perspective, was based on the Australian 
Government's 'value of statistical life year' (AUD 213,000).
RESULTS: Over five years, the model predicted 263,722 strokes among the 
Australian population. The implementation of the QASC protocol was predicted to 
prevent 1,154 deaths and yield a gain of 876 years of life (0.003 per stroke), 
and 3,180 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.012 per stroke). There was an 
estimated net saving of AUD 65.2 million in healthcare costs (AUD 247 per 
stroke) and AUD 251.7 million in societal costs (AUD 955 per stroke).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the QASC protocol in Australia represents both a 
dominant (cost-saving) strategy, from a healthcare and a societal perspective.

Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women 
and significantly worsens physical, mental and social functioning. The aim is to 
evaluate the social and economic burden of treatment strategies for breast 
cancer in the North East region of Bulgaria.Areas covered: A retrospective, 
observational, population-based study among patients with breast cancer was 
performed. Patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and costs were assessed 
during a four-year period (2016-2019). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
were calculated to estimate the social burden.Results: Approximately 99% of 
patients (n = 1,373) were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 60.6 years. 
The total economic burden of breast cancer during the time of the study was 
estimated to be 21,076,809.12 BGN where the direct costs were equal to 
19,634,509.67 BGN and the total indirect costs due to premature death amounted 
to 1,442,299.45 BGN. Total DALYs were 110.56 for all patients corresponding to 
1,898,340.80 BGN.Conclusions: This study demonstrates the significant social and 
economic burden of breast cancer as further, more comprehensive regional and 
national-based studies related to the total economic burden of breast cancer are 
required.

BACKGROUND: Fiji, a Pacific Island nation of 884,887 (2017 census), has 
experienced a prolonged epidemiological transition. This study examines trends 
in mortality and life expectancy (LE) in Fiji by sex and ethnicity over 
1996-2017, with comparisons to published estimates.
METHODS: Trends in infant mortality rates (IMR), under-5 mortality (U5M), adult 
mortality (probability of dying), LE (at birth) and directly age-standardised 
death rates (DASRs) by sex and ethnicity, are calculated (with 95% confidence 
limits) using unit death records from the Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical 
Services. The LE gap between populations, or within populations over time, is 
examined using decomposition by age. Period trends are assessed for statistical 
significance using linear regression.
RESULTS: Over 1996-98 to 2014-17: IMR and U5M for i-Taukei and Fijians of Indian 
descent declined; U5M decline for i-Taukei (24.6 to 20.1/1000 live births) was 
significant (p = 0.016). Mortality (15-59 years) for i-Taukei males was 
unchanged at 27% but declined for Indians 33 to 30% (p = 0.101). Mortality for 
i-Taukei females increased 22 to 24% (p = 0.011) but declined for Indians 20 to 
18% (p = 0.240). DASRs 1996-2017 were lower for i-Taukei (9.3 to 8.2/1000 
population) than Indian males (10.6 to 9.8/1000). DASRs declined for i-Taukei 
(both sexes, p < 0.05), and for Indians (both sexes, p > 0.05). Over 22 years, 
LE at birth increased by 1 year or less (p = 0.030 in male i-Taukei). In 
2014-17, LE (years) for males was: i-Taukei 64.9, Indians 63.5; and females: 
i-Taukei 67.0 and Indians 68.2. Mortality changes in most 5-year age groups 
increased or decreased the LE gap less than 10 weeks over 22 years. Compared to 
international agency reports, 2014-17 empirical LE estimates (males 64.7, 
females 67.8) were lower, as was IMR.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on empirical data, LE in Fiji has minimally improved over 
1996-2017, and is lower than some international agencies report. Adult mortality 
was higher in Indian than i-Taukei men, and higher in i-Taukei than Indian 
women. Exclusion of stillbirths resulted in IMRs lower than previously reported. 
Differing mortality trends in subgroups highlight the need to collect census and 
health data by ethnicity and sex, to monitor health outcomes and inform resource 
allocation.

BACKGROUND: International dietary guidelines aim to reduce risks of all-cause 
mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and fatal CVD often associated with 
poor dietary habits. However, most studies have examined associations with 
individual nutrients, foods, or dietary patterns, as opposed to quantifying the 
pooled health effects of adherence to international dietary recommendations. We 
investigated associations between total adherence to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) dietary recommendations for saturated fats, free sugars, 
fibre, and fruits and vegetables and all-cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal 
CVD.
METHODS: We included participants from the UK Biobank cohort recruited in 
2006-2010, which provided at least two valid 24-h dietary assessments. We 
defined adherence to dietary recommendations as ≤ 10% saturated fats, ≤ 10% free 
sugars, ≥ 25 g/day fibre, and ≥ 5 servings of fruits and vegetables/day. 
Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models were used to investigate 
prospective associations with all-cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal CVD. 
In cross-sectional analyses, multivariable linear regression was used to examine 
associations with cardiometabolic risk factors.
RESULTS: Among 115,051 participants (39-72 years), only 29.7%, 38.5%, 22.3%, and 
9.5% met 0, 1, 2, or 3-4 recommendations, respectively. There was a lower risk 
of all-cause mortality among participants meeting more dietary recommendations 
(Ptrend < 0.001), with a significantly lower risk among participants meeting 2:
