BACKGROUND: Progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease 
characterized by endothelial lesions and fibrosis of the skin and other organs. 
Patients' quality of life and life expectancy are determined by the intensity of 
pulmonary, esophageal, cardiac, and renal involvement. Neurological involvement 
was considered to be rare, but increasing evidence indicates that peripheral and 
autonomic neuropathies commonly occur. Conditions seen with SSc, such as 
pulmonary fibrosis and gastro-esophageal reflux, have the potential to affect 
sleep. No systematic assessment of sleep-related problems associated with this 
disorder has been performed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An all-night polysomnogram and a clinical interview 
blinded to sleep status were obtained for 27 consecutive SSc patients. Sleep 
data were compared to age adjusted published normative values. Correlations were 
determined for sleep and clinical data.
RESULTS: Patients with SSc had a reduced sleep efficiency (SE) (mean+/-SD: 
82+/-12.3%) and rapid eye movement sleep (13.1+/-5.6%) and increased arousal 
index (26.1+/-13.0) and slow wave sleep (25.7+/-9.7%). The periodic leg movement 
index (PLMI) exceeded 5/h in 13 patients (48%) and 25/h in seven patients. Six 
patients had restless legs syndrome (RLS). Significant disordered breathing was 
absent. The RLS patients showed a greater arousal index than all other patients. 
PLMI was correlated with SE for RLS but not for non-RLS patients. Esophageal 
dyskinesia, dyspnea, and RLS were significantly associated with poor sleep.
CONCLUSION: Patients with SSc have significant disturbance of their sleep. 
Esophageal dyskinesia and dyspnea, which are common complications of SSc, were 
commonly associated with indices of sleep disruption. RLS but not sleep apnea 
appears to have an increased prevalence in SSc.

OBJECTIVES: To gain reliable data on sleeping habits and sleep disturbances of 
the Austrian population.
BACKGROUND: Exact data on sleeping habits are of interest in relation to 
assessment of sleep disturbance-related illnesses and general social processes.
METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed with recruitment of 
a representative sample of 1049 Austrians (aged 15-82 years), according to the 
Federal Statistics population characteristics. Interviews were conducted in the 
households of the participants by specially trained interviewers of an institute 
for empirical research.
RESULTS: Men consider their quality of sleep to be significantly better than 
women (P=0.00234), and younger persons consider their quality of sleep to be 
significantly better than older persons (P=0.00001). In comparison, women and 
people over the age of 50 report worse subjective sleep quality, worse sleep 
efficiency, more difficulty in falling asleep and sleep maintenance, more apneic 
events, more pathologic limb movements, more daytime dysfunction, and more 
intake of sleeping medication. Other sociodemographic factors influence sleep 
reports to a lesser extent.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjectively disturbed sleep (prevalence in the total population 
24.9%), excessive hypnotic drug intake (prevalence 13.0%), and daytime 
dysfunction (prevalence 17.4%) are a widespread problem, especially in women and 
older people. With increasing life expectancy in Western societies, the 
prevalence of sleep disturbances will increase.

Data from 756 myasthenic patients were analyzed for diagnostic criteria, 
clinical aspects, and therapeutic approaches. The patients were followed up at 
our institution from 1981 to 2001. Clinical evaluation was performed according 
to the myasthenia gravis score adopted at our clinic. Clinical features of each 
patient (comprising demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, immunological, 
radiological, and surgical data, as well as serial myasthenia gravis scores) 
were filed in a relational database containing more than 7000 records. Clinical 
efficacy and variables influencing outcome were assessed by life-table methods 
and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Complete stable remission, as 
defined by the Task Force of the Medical Scientific Advisory Board of the 
Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, was the end point for good prognosis. 
Four hundred and ninety-nine patients (66%) were female and 257 (34%) were male. 
Mean follow-up was 55.1 +/- 48.1 months. Onset of symptoms peaked in the third 
decade in females, whereas the male distribution was bimodal with peaks in the 
third and sixth decades. Modality of myasthenia gravis presentation was as 
follows: ocular, 39.3%; generalized, 28.5%; bulbar, 31.3%; and respiratory, 
0.8%. Thymectomy was carried out on 63.7% of our patients by different 
approaches: (1) transcervical; (2) transsternal; (3) video-thoracoscopic 
mini-invasive surgery. The last approach has been preferentially used in more 
recent years and accounted for 62.4% of the thymectomized myasthenia gravis 
population. Univariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that variables 
such as sex (female), age at onset (below 40 years), thymectomy, and 
histological diagnosis of thymic hyperplasia were significantly associated with 
complete stable remission, whereas on multivariate analysis only age at onset 
below 40 years and thymectomy were confirmed.

School and Eaton-Peabody Laboratory, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary,

The increase in life expectancy is accompanied by the growing burden of chronic 
diseases. Hearing loss is perhaps the most prevalent of all chronic diseases. In 
addition to age-related hearing loss, a substantial number of cases of 
audiological impairment are either congenital in nature or acquired during 
childhood. The permanence of hearing loss is mainly due to the inability of the 
cochlear sensory epithelium to replace lost mechanoreceptor cells, or hair 
cells. Generation of hair cells from a renewable source of progenitors that can 
be transplanted into damaged inner ears is a principal requirement for potential 
cell replacement therapy in this organ. Here, we present an experimental 
protocol that enables us to routinely create inner ear progenitors from murine 
embryonic stem cells in vitro. These progenitors express a comprehensive set of 
marker genes that define the developing inner ear, in particular the organ's 
developing sensory patches. We further demonstrate that cells that express 
markers characteristic of hair cells differentiate from embryonic stem 
cell-derived progenitors. Finally, we show that these progenitors integrate into 
the developing inner ear at sites of epithelial injury and that integrated cells 
start expressing hair cell markers and display hair bundles when situated in 
cochlear or vestibular sensory epithelia in vivo.

BACKGROUND: This paper is part of a project to identify the proportion of the 
burden of each mental disorder averted by current and optimal interventions, and 
the cost-effectiveness of both.
AIMS: To use epidemiological data on schizophrenia to model the 
cost-effectiveness of current and optimal treatment.
METHOD: Calculate the burden of schizophrenia in the years lived with disability 
(YLD) component of disability-adjusted life-years lost, the proportion averted 
by current interventions, the proportion that could be averted by optimal 
treatment and the cost-effectiveness of both.
RESULTS: Current interventions avert some 13% of the burden, whereas 22% could 
be averted by optimal treatment. Current interventions cost about AUS 200,000 
dollars per YLD averted, whereas optimal treatment at a similar cost could 
increase the number of YLDs averted by two-thirds. Even so, the majority of the 
burden of schizophrenia remains unavertable.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal treatment is affordable within the present budget and 
should be implemented.

Newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry for medium-chain Acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase deficiency: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS) for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is 
cost-effective versus not screening and to define the contributions of disease, 
test, and population parameters on the decision.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was designed to perform 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses measuring the discounted, 
incremental cost per life-year saved and per quality-adjusted life-year saved of 
newborn screening for MCADD compared with not screening. A hypothetical cohort 
of neonates made transitions among a set of health states that reflected 
clinical status, morbidity, and cost. Outcomes were estimated for time horizons 
of 20 and 70 years. Probabilities and costs were derived from a retrospective 
chart review of a 32-patient cohort treated over the past 30 years at the 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, clinical experience with MCADD patient 
management, patient-family interviews, cost surveys, state sources, and 
published studies. In addition to older patients who came to medical attention 
by symptomatic presentation, our patient group included 6 individuals whose 
MCADD had been diagnosed by supplemental newborn screening. Estimates of the 
expected net changes in costs and life expectancy for MCADD screening were used 
to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed on key input variables, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
computed through second-order Monte Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: In our base-case analysis over the first 20 years of life, the cost of 
newborn screening for MCADD was approximately 11,000 dollars(2001 US dollars; 
95% CI: <0-33,800 dollars) per life-year saved, or 5600 dollars (95% CI: 
<0-17,100 dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year saved compared with not 
screening. Over a 70-year horizon, the respective ratios were approximately 300 
dollars (95% CI: <0-13,000 dollars) and 100 dollars (95% CI: <0-6900 dollars). 
The results were robust when tested over plausible ranges for diagnostic test 
sensitivity and specificity, MCADD prevalence, asymptomatic rate, and screening 
cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation modeling indicates that newborn screening for MCADD 
reduces morbidity and mortality at an incremental cost below the range for 
accepted health care interventions. At the 70-year horizon, the model predicts 
that almost all of the additional costs of screening would be offset by avoided 
sequelae.

Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human activated protein C and the influence of 
severity of illness in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis.

Medicine, Sunnybrook and women's College Health Sciences Centre, University of 
Toronto, Ontario, Canada. rob.fowler@swchsc.on.ca

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of recombinant human activated 
protein C (rhAPC) compared with usual therapy for patients with severe sepsis, 
and also to determine the influence that severity of illness exerts on 
cost-effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use a Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis 
of treatment strategies for patients with severe sepsis. Therapy includes 
treatment with either rhAPC and usual therapy, or usual therapy alone. 
Probabilities for clinical outcomes were obtained from a large randomized 
clinical trial comparing the use of rhAPC with placebo (PROWESS study) and from 
outcomes literature for patients with severe sepsis and its complications. Cost 
estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement rates, Health Care Financing 
Administration information and the literature. Outcome measures include 
life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Compared with usual therapy alone, rhAPC treatment for patients with 
very severe sepsis (APACHE II score > or = 25) was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13 493/QALY. Treatment of patients with 
less severe sepsis with rhAPC (APACHE II score < 25) had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $403,000/QALY. For patients with very severe sepsis 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for treatment with rhAPC remained under 
$30,000/QALY, over a broad range of variables, including costs of rhAPC, costs 
of acute care and costs and probabilities of complications of treatment. For 
patients with less severe sepsis, drug costs would need to fall well below 
current market price before achieving cost-effectiveness. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis comparing rhAPC treatment with usual therapy for patients 
with very severe sepsis showed that < 1% of Monte Carlo simulations had 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios > $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of rhAPC for the treatment of patients with very severe 
sepsis, as determined by APACHE II score > or = 25, appears cost-effective, 
while treatment of patients with APACHE II score < 25 is not cost-effective.

health utilities to measure health in hypertension.

Stockholm, Sweden. Carola.Bardage@mep.ki.se

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a psychometric 
health-related quality-of-life instrument (the SF-36)-and two health utility 
measures [the time trade-off (TTO) and rating scale (RS) methods) among 
hypertensives in a general population. In the analyses were adjusted for 
comorbidity. The study was based on a postal questionnaire that was sent to a 
random sample of 8000 inhabitants aged 20-84 years (response rate 68%) in 
Uppsala County, Sweden, in 1995. The results showed only a moderate correlation 
between the TTO and the RS methods. The different dimensions of SF-36 were 
overall lower correlated with the TTO method than with the RS method. 
Co-morbidity was not associated with the RS or the TTO method among 
hypertensives. The regression equations explained 58% of the variance in RS 
among hypertensives. The corresponding value for the TTO method was about 20%. 
In conclusion, our study found that among hypertensives the SF-36 is low to 
moderate correlated to the TTO and RS methods. Health utilities and psychometric 
measures represent different attributes of health. It is therefore important to 
be aware of the differences between psychometric and utility measures when 
interpreting results from studies using different methods. More work is needed 
to explicate if health utilities can be obtained from the SF-36.

AIMS: Blood pressure (BP) reduction is crucial in reducing cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. The IBPC (Israeli Blood Pressure Control) program was 
initiated in order to enhance the control of modifiable risk factors among 
high-risk hypertensive patients under follow-up by general practitioners in 
Israel. The cost effectiveness of an intervention program is an important factor 
in the decision-making process of its implementation and therefore was evaluated 
here. The objective of this evaluation is to estimate the costs, monetary 
savings and benefits in terms of QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) that would 
be expected if the program were to be expanded to 100 clinics nationwide, 
enabling around 14800 persons to be treated.
METHODS: Hypertensive patients were screened in 30 general practice clinics, 
supervised by specialists in family medicine, each seeing 1000-5000 patients; 
50-250 hypertensive patients were diagnosed at each participating clinic. BP 
levels, body mass index (BMI), lipid and glucose levels, as well as target organ 
damage and medications were recorded for all patients.
RESULTS: A total of 4948 (2079, 42% males) were registered. Mean age was 64.8 
+/- 12 years. After 1 year of follow-up versus baseline, the various parameters 
were as follows: BP control was achieved in 46.4% vs 29% of all hypertensive 
patients. LDL control (JNC VI criteria) was achieved in 41.7% vs 31.2% of all 
patients. Fasting plasma glucose control (glucose < 126 mg/dl) was achieved in 
22% vs 19% of diabetic patients and 5.2% vs 3.1% of the diabetics had fasting 
plasma glucose levels > 200 mg/dl. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) was noted in 36.7% 
vs 43.8% at baseline. The cost utility analysis of the reduction in risk factors 
was calculated based on the international dicta applied to the reduction in risk 
factors as a result of treatment. For 100 clinics nationwide and 14800 persons 
to be treated the net saving to health services would be $977993 and the 
increase in QALYs would be 602 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Better risk factor control in hypertensive patients by general 
practitioners could reduce morbidity and mortality as well as be cost effective.

Transscleral resection versus iodine brachytherapy for choroidal malignant 
melanomas 6 millimeters or more in thickness: a matched case-control study.

University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.

OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in treatment outcome after transscleral 
resection (TSR) and iodine brachytherapy (IBT) of choroidal melanomas too thick 
for ruthenium brachytherapy.
DESIGN: Matched case-control study.
SETTING: Two national ocular oncology services.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine pairs of patients with choroidal melanoma 6 mm thick or 
more (range = 6-14), treated within 3 years of each other by either TSR or IBT, 
and retrospectively matched by age, visual acuity at diagnosis, largest basal 
tumor diameter, and posterior extension of the tumor.
INTERVENTION: Iodine brachytherapy in Finland or TSR in United Kingdom. 
Prospectively collected time-to-event data were compared with parametric Weibull 
regression, adjusting for matching.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor control, complications, and visual acuity.
RESULTS: Risk of local recurrence after IBT was smaller than that after TSR 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.11, P<0.001, 
Weibull regression adjusted for matching), but the 8-year all-cause and 
melanoma-specific (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.30-2.22, P = 0.69) survivals did not 
differ. The risks of cataract (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.08-3.89, P = 0.029), 
maculopathy (HR = 2.28, 95% CI = 0.96-5.43, P = 0.062), and vitreous hemorrhage 
(HR = 2.30, 95% CI = 0.95-5.57, P = 0.064) were higher after IBT. Rubeosis, 
neovascular glaucoma, and optic neuropathy developed only after IBT. Risk of 
retinal detachment, exudative after IBT and rhegmatogenous after TSR (HR = 0.84, 
95% CI = 0.40-1.75, P = 0.63), and risk of losing 20/60 vision (HR = 1.37, 95% 
CI 0.76-2.45, P = 0.29) were comparable between the groups, but risk of losing 
20/200 vision was higher after IBT (HR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.48-3.83, P<0.001). No 
overall difference in quality of life was found.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TSR preserves 20/200 vision better than 
IBT and avoids some of its major complications, but increases the risk of local 
recurrence. About 350 patients would need to be randomized to prove that TRS 
preserves 20/60 vision better than IBT.

Switzerland. leonidas.zografos@ophtal.vd.ch

OBJECTIVE: Presentation of a large series of patients with metastatic melanoma 
involving the eye and orbit.
DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen cases of metastatic melanoma involving intraocular 
tissues, 6 cases of metastatic melanoma in the orbit, and 1 case of metastatic 
melanoma involving both the eye and the orbit, treated in Lausanne between 1986 
and 2002, were identified from the computer files of the ocular oncology and 
orbitopalpebral surgery units of Jules Gonin Hospital.
METHODS: The analysis is based on the demographic data concerning these 
patients, clinical data concerning the tumor, the treatment applied, the 
outcome, and the follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation of intraocular and orbital 
metastasis, interval between primary tumor and ocular metastasis, survival of 
the patients, evaluation of various therapeutic protocols.
RESULTS: Intraocular metastases (14 cases, 15 eyes) were situated in the choroid 
in 11 cases (isolated lesion, 6 cases; multiple lesions, 3 cases; diffuse 
involvement, 2 cases), in the iris and ciliary body in 2 cases, and in the 
retina and vitreous in 2 other cases. The primary tumor was a cutaneous melanoma 
in 8 cases, a melanoma of the contralateral eye in 3 cases, a mucosal melanoma 
in 1 case, and was unknown in 2 cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis 
of ocular metastases and the patient's death was 8.8 months (range, 1-48 
months). The primary tumor in the 7 cases of orbital metastases was a cutaneous 
melanoma in 5 cases, a uveal melanoma in the contralateral eye in 1 case, and 
was unknown in 1 case. The mean interval between the diagnosis of orbital 
metastases and death was 19.7 months (range, 5-48 months). The patients were 
treated by various protocols. The best results, in terms of both local tumor 
control and preservation of visual function, were obtained with circumscribed 
proton beam radiotherapy or external beam irradiation, depending on the site and 
extent of the tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanomas to the eye and orbit are rare and generally 
occur in patients with disseminated metastases during the terminal stages of the 
disease, with a short life expectancy. Treatment is palliative and, among the 
various possible treatment options, circumscribed proton beam radiotherapy or 
global photon beam radiotherapy, at relatively high irradiation doses, seems to 
achieve the most favorable results.

Cancer risk and diet in India.

India is a developing country with one of the most diverse populations and diets 
in the world. Cancer rates in India are lower than those seen in Western 
countries, but are rising with increasing migration of rural population to the 
cities, increase in life expectancy and changes in lifestyles. In India, rates 
for oral and oesophageal cancers are some of the highest in the world. In 
contrast, the rates for colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers are one of the 
lowest. Studies of Indian immigrants in Western societies indicate that rates of 
cancer and other chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes, 
increase dramatically after a generation in the adopted country. Change of diet 
is among the factors that may be responsible for the changing disease rates. 
Diet in India encompasses diversity unknown to most other countries, with many 
dietary patterns emanating from cultural and religious teachings that have 
existed for thousands of years. Very little is known, however, about the role of 
the Indian diet in causation of cancer or its role, if any, in prevention of 
cancer, although more attention is being focused on certain aspects of the 
Indian diet, such as vegetarianism, spices, and food additives. Of particular 
interest for cancer prevention is the role of turmeric (curcumin), an ingredient 
in common Indian curry spice. Researchers also have investigated cumin, chilies, 
kalakhar, Amrita Bindu, and various plant seeds for their apparent cancer 
preventive properties. Few prospective studies, however, have been conducted to 
investigate the role of Indian diet and its various components in prevention of 
cancer. From a public health perspective, there is an increasing need to develop

BACKGROUND: Permanent pacing is the therapy of choice for treating severe and/or 
symptomatic bradyarrhythmia. However, augmented life expectancy and increasing 
health care expenditures have led to questions concerning the routine use of 
electrotherapy in very elderly patients. This study is aimed at assessing data 
on the actual number, characteristics, and survival of patients requiring pacing 
therapy at age > or =80 years.
METHODS: Between 1971 and 2000, 1588 patients aged > or =80 years completed a 
standardized 6- to 12-month follow-up after pacemaker (PM) implantation, 
resulting in a total of 5244 patient years. Kaplan-Meier analyses were computed 
to visualize survival differences in various subgroups and implantation periods.
RESULTS: Today, patients aged > or =80 years account for 32% of all PM 
implantations. An increasing 5-year survival after PM implantation to the 
current rate of 66% was found, compared to 37% and 47% in the previous decades. 
Based on a mean survival time of 8 years, clinical symptoms can be effectively 
treated with costs of < or =500 dollars per patient per year. Prognostic 
parameters were the decade of implantation (relative risk [RR] 0.80, CI 
0.67-0.96, P < or =.02), a history of presyncope (RR 0.73, CI 0.57-0.95, P < or 
=.02), and male sex (RR 1.20, CI 1.04-1.40, P < or =.02). However, none of these 
parameters can be recommended for estimating outcome or for guiding device 
selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged > or =80 years account for an increasing portion of 
PM implantations. Considering the remaining life expectancy of 8 years in these 
patients, PM therapy is a clinically and economically effective therapeutic 
option to control bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms.

Impact of the LDS church's health doctrine on deaths from diseases and 
conditions associated with cigarette smoking.

PURPOSE: This study provides a quantitative assessment of the impact the LDS 
Church's health doctrine has on deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) 
from diseases and conditions associated with cigarette smoking in Utah.
METHODS: Pooled estimates of relative risk from review articles and 
meta-analyses in combination with 1996 Utah smoking prevalence data were used to 
calculate smoking-attributed etiologic fractions, deaths, and YPLL.
RESULTS: Numbers of deaths attributed to smoking between 1994 and 1998 in Utah 
are 1730 for LDS men, 721 for LDS women, 1739 for non-LDS men, and 1138 for 
non-LDS women. Corresponding annual crude death rates attributed to smoking (per 
100,000) are 46.5, 18.9, 133.9, and 90.1. YPLL due to smoking for the study 
period are 22,338 for LDS men, 9205 for LDS women, 21,771 for non-LDS men, and 
13,168 for non-LDS women. Corresponding YPLL crude rates are 600.6, 241.2, 
1676.7, and 1043.3. If smoking-attributed death and YPLL rates for non-LDS 
matched LDS, there would be 1135 fewer deaths for men and 899 fewer deaths for 
women, and 13,973 fewer years of life lost for men and 10,124 fewer YPLL for 
women between 1994 and 1998 in Utah.
CONCLUSIONS: The LDS Church's health doctrine concerning tobacco goes beyond 
health risk information and social and financial considerations to include a 
religious dimension. Consequently, LDS experience a comparatively low burden of 
death and YPLL attributed to smoking.

ROC.

BACKGROUND: while life expectancy among older people has been lengthened due to 
improved public health and medical interventions, the importance of 
health-related quality of life in later life has also increased. However, the 
application of a generic health-related quality of life measure for older people 
needs to be carefully validated.
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the practicality, reliability, validity, and 
responsiveness of the use of the brief version of the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life for people aged 65 years or older.
DESIGN: a prospective study.
METHODS: for a baseline assessment, 1200 community-dwelling older people living 
in Shin-Sher Township of Taichung County, Taiwan, completed the brief version of 
World Health Organization Quality of Life at their residences either by 
themselves or with the assistance of an interviewer. Furthermore, score changes 
in each health-related quality of life domain after a fall were followed up for 
assessing its responsiveness.
RESULTS: the average length of time required to complete the questionnaire was 
short (10.6 minutes for self-administration and 15.3 minutes for personal 
interview), and the score distribution in each domain was symmetrical with no 
floor or ceiling effect. Furthermore, all domain scores indicated excellent 
discriminant validity, construct validity, and responsiveness as well as good 
internal consistency and intra- and inter-observer test-retest reliabilities. 
Nevertheless, two items related to work capacity and sexual activity had higher 
missing values (4.5% and 16.5%) and poor interobserver test-retest reliabilities 
(0.43 and 0.20). Suggested modifications to the two items for older people are 
discussed.
CONCLUSION: with a few modifications, the brief World Health Organization 
Quality of Life is a suitable health-related quality of life instrument for 
older people.

Effects of lidocaine into knee on QF strength and EMG in patients with ACL 
lesion.

Author information:

of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. yuk1@fb.freeserve.ne.jp

PURPOSE: In our previous study, we found that injection of lidocaine into intact 
knees reduced the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and integrated 
electromyogram (I-EMG) of the quadriceps femoris (QF). This study was designed 
to investigate changes in the MVC and I-EMG of the QF in response to lidocaine, 
in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion, to evaluate 
alpha-motoneuron activity innervating the QF.
METHODS: The MVC of knee extension and I-EMG of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus 
lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) muscles were measured in eight patients 
with ruptured ACL, before and after lidocaine injection into the knee.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between preinjection and 
postinjection values of MVC (preinjection: 167 +/- 49 N.m; postinjection: 164 
+/- 55 N.m) and I-EMG (preinjection: VL: 0.11 +/- 0.06, VM: 0.13 +/- 0.10, RF: 
0.09 +/- 0.04) (postinjection: VL: 0.12 +/- 0.07, VM: 0.13 +/- 0.10, RF: 0.09 
+/- 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that hindrance of afferent feedback from the 
knee in patients with ACL rupture did not significantly change alpha-motoneuron 
activity. Lidocaine injection into the knee joint of the subjects in this study 
only attenuated afferent feedback from mechanoreceptors in the knee joint 
cavity, but not in the ACL, as afferent feedback from ACL was already lost due 
to ACL rupture. This indicated that attenuation of afferent feedback from 
mechanoreceptors in the knee joint cavity other than the ACL did not 
significantly decrease the activity of alpha-motoneurons innervating the QF 
during MVC exertion. Therefore, our findings provide evidence that afferent 
feedback from the ACL has a major influence on the MVC exertion of the QF.

General principles of external beam radiation therapy for skeletal metastases.

Oncology Center, Lutherville, MD 21093, USA. frassde@jhmi.edu

Radiation therapy plays a major role in the treatment of patients with bone 
metastases. The primary goals of treatment include pain relief and relief of 
neurologic symptoms, if present. Approximately 70% of patients will achieve pain 
relief with palliative external beam radiotherapy. Improvement in the severity 
of pain may occur within as few as 48 to 72 hours of initiation of therapy, but 
in some patients significant relief of pain may not occur for 4 weeks after 
completion of therapy. Treatment schemes ranging from 800 cGy in a single 
treatment to 3000 cGy in 10 treatments have not been shown to result in major 
differences in outcome. Treatment decisions must be individualized based on 
factors such as the patient's performance status, life expectancy, location of 
the lesion, and size of area to be treated. External beam radiotherapy is 
recommended after surgical treatment of pathologic fractures or impending 
fractures to decrease the need for a second surgical procedure and improve the 
patient's functional outcome. External beam radiotherapy continues to be an 
important component of the palliative treatment of bone metastases. Its 
integration with newer therapeutic modalities such as vertebroplasty and 
radiofrequency ablation currently is being studied.

Medical Center, Denver, CO, USA. cindykellymd@yahoo.com

Metastatic lesions to bone outnumber primary bone malignancies. Osseous 
metastases to the tibia tend to be less common than osseous metastases to other 
long bones. This study examined the treatment options for a population of 
patients with metastatic disease to the tibia, with surgical intervention being 
the cornerstone of treatment for the osseous lesion. A multicenter study had 592 
patients with metastatic disease to the bone, with 26 lesions occurring in the 
tibia (4.4%) during a 13-year period. No patient had concurrent metastases 
distal to the elbow. After confirmation of metastatic disease, treatment 
consisted of surgical intervention in all patients, including plate 
osteosynthesis, intramedullary rodding and cementation, endoprosthetic 
replacement, and in most patients, postoperative radiation therapy. In 96% of 
patients, the reconstruction outlasted their life expectancy. All patients were 
satisfied with their reconstruction. Four complications were encountered in the 
postoperative period, all requiring additional surgery. Aggressive treatment of 
osseous metastasis is justified in patients with metastatic disease despite a 
limited life expectancy. Intervention by an orthopaedic oncologist may result in 
fewer reconstructive failures. Surgical intervention contributes to an improved 
quality of life and limb function, ease of nursing care, and may help in 
maintaining patient independence.

Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1070, USA. wgward@wfubmc.edu

The senior author's 12-year consecutive series of surgery for metastatic disease 
of the femur was reviewed. Treatment of 97 impending pathologic fractures 
yielded better results than treatment of 85 completed pathologic fractures with 
less average blood loss (438 cc versus 636 cc), shorter hospital stay (7 days 
versus 11 days), greater likelihood of discharge to home as opposed to an 
extended care facility (79% versus 56%) and greater likelihood of resuming 
support-free ambulation (35% versus 12%). Internal stabilization with a 
reconstruction-type intramedullary nail provided satisfactory pain relief and 
functional preservation for most patients with impending pathologic femur 
fractures (69 of 97, 71%), although alternate forms of internal fixation (21 of 
97, 22%) or cemented arthroplasty (seven of 97, 7%) were used successfully. 
Completed pathologic fractures were more likely to require some form of 
arthroplasty (47 of 85, 55%), although reconstruction-type nails (20 of 85, 
24%), and other internal fixation techniques (18 of 85, 21%) also were used. 
Modular oncology-type arthroplasty systems offered a viable salvage option in 
both groups. In the absence of conflicting goals or contraindications, internal 
stabilization of impending pathologic fractures before the completion of the 
fracture seems to be reasonable and appropriate.

Illustrating the impact of including future costs in economic evaluations: an 
application to end-stage renal disease care.

There are strong theoretical arguments for including future costs for related 
and unrelated medical care and non-medical expenditures within economic 
evaluations. Nevertheless, there is limited data on how inclusion of such costs 
affects the cost effectiveness of medical interventions in practice. For a 
low-cost intervention that improves survival in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients, we sought to determine how the inclusion of future costs for related 
medical care (i.e. dialysis and transplantation) and for unrelated medical care 
and non-medical expenditure would affect the magnitude of the cost per QALY 
ratio. We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing hemodialysis using a 
synthetic dialyser (the current treatment of choice in Canada) with the 
historical gold-standard treatment (use of a cellulose dialyser). We contrasted 
the results of the analysis including and excluding various measures of future 
costs. While the inclusion of future costs for unrelated medical care and 
non-medical expenditures had a significant impact on the cost per QALY ratio, 
the size of the cost per QALY ratio was most sensitive to inclusion of future 
costs for related medical care. Our analysis shows that even relatively 
inexpensive interventions that extend survival of dialysis patients may not be 
cost-effective since, by extending survival, the extra outpatient dialysis costs 
that are incurred are large. Inclusion of such costs (which, in and of itself, 
is methodologically correct) in economic evaluations in this area may mitigate 
against the acceptance of interventions that are relatively inexpensive 
themselves but which improve patient survival.

A view from the bridge: agreement between the SF-6D utility algorithm and the 
Health Utilities Index.

O'Brien BJ(1), Spath M, Blackhouse G, Severens JL, Dorian P, Brazier J.

Canada. obrienb@mcmaster.ca

BACKGROUND: The SF-6D is a new health state classification and utility scoring 
system based on 6 dimensions ('6D') of the Short Form 36, and permits a 
"bridging" transformation between SF-36 responses and utilities. The Health 
Utilities Index, mark 3 (HUI3) is a valid and reliable multi-attribute health 
utility scale that is widely used. We assessed within-subject agreement between 
SF-6D utilities and those from HUI3.
METHODS: Patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death and participating in 
a randomized trial of implantable defibrillator therapy completed both 
instruments at baseline. Score distributions were inspected by scatterplot and 
histogram and mean score differences compared by paired t-test. Pearson 
correlation was computed between instrument scores and also between dimension 
scores within instruments. Between-instrument agreement was by intra-class 
correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: SF-6D and HUI3 forms were available from 246 patients. Mean scores for 
HUI3 and SF-6D were 0.61 (95% CI 0.60-0.63) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.54-0.62) 
respectively; a difference of 0.03 (p<0.03). Score intervals for HUI3 and SF-6D 
were (-0.21 to 1.0) and (0.30-0.95). Correlation between the instrument scores 
was 0.58 (95% CI 0.48-0.68) and agreement by ICC was 0.42 (95% CI 0.31-0.52). 
Correlations between dimensions of SF-6D were higher than for HUI3.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study casts doubt on the whether utilities and QALYs estimated 
via SF-6D are comparable with those from HUI3. Utility differences may be due to 
differences in underlying concepts of health being measured, or different 
measurement approaches, or both. No gold standard exists for utility measurement 
and the SF-6D is a valuable addition that permits SF-36 data to be transformed 
into utilities to estimate QALYs. The challenge is developing a better 
understanding as to why these classification-based utility instruments differ so 
markedly in their distributions and point estimates of derived utilities.

Anastomotic aneurysm following aortobifemoral bypass.

Madiba TE(1), Nair R, Mars M, Robbs JV.

Author information:
(1)Vascular Service, University of Natal, Durban.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the incidence of anastomotic 
aneurysm following aortobifemoral bypass and to document management of this 
condition in our practice.
DESIGN: This is a prospective study of anastomotic aneurysms developing in 
patients with aortobifemoral bypasses followed up for 49 months.
SETTING: Two tertiary referral hospitals served by the Durban Metropolitan 
Vascular Service.
PATIENTS: Four hundred and ninety-two patients underwent aortobifemoral bypass. 
Anastomotic aneurysms (N = 25) developed in 23 patients. Presence of anastomotic 
aneurysm was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent aneurysm repair.
RESULTS: Operations performed were: excision and interposition graft (15), 
re-suture (6), tube graft (1), crossover (1), graft-popliteal bypass (1) and 
ligation (1). There were no deaths and no recurrences. Wound infections occurred 
in 2 patients and occlusion of the opposite limb occurred in 1.
CONCLUSION: Anastomotic aneurysms following aortobifemoral bypass are uncommon. 
They commonly occur as a result of anastomotic disruption. Management includes 
repair or excision, depending on the prevailing circumstances, and can be 
performed with good results.

JNK signaling confers tolerance to oxidative stress and extends lifespan in 
Drosophila.

601 Elmwood Avenue, Box 633, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.

Changes in the genetic makeup of an organism can extend lifespan significantly 
if they promote tolerance to environmental insults and thus prevent the general 
deterioration of cellular function that is associated with aging. Here, we 
introduce the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway as a genetic 
determinant of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Based on expression profiling 
experiments, we demonstrate that JNK functions at the center of a signal 
transduction network that coordinates the induction of protective genes in 
response to oxidative challenge. JNK signaling activity thus alleviates the 
toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we show that flies 
with mutations that augment JNK signaling accumulate less oxidative damage and 
live dramatically longer than wild-type flies. Our work thus identifies the 
evolutionarily conserved JNK signaling pathway as a major genetic factor in the 
control of longevity.

More than a sum of our cells.

Hopkin K.

Cells in the body grow and die, cells in lab dishes grow and die, and individual 
organisms grow and die. The parallels seem maddeningly obvious, but scores of 
scientists still labor to draw the correct connections, to uncover the 
mechanisms that underlie aging in cell culture flasks and in whole animals. Do 
our cells stop growing, quit working, cease dividing, or start dying as we age? 
Do we die when our cells do, or are we somehow more than the sum of our cells? 
For decades, scientists have searched for evidence that links changes in cell 
growth, cell function, cell division, and cell death to the phenomenon we call 
aging. Although definitive proof eludes them, researchers continue to conduct 
experiments in tissue culture and in animal models, amassing information that 
points us toward a greater understanding of what aging is--and is not.

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

This Perspective is a summary of the Comparative Biology of Aging Workshop that 
was held in February 2002 by the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, MD. 
Participants discussed ways to exploit similarities and differences in aging 
among diverse species to learn more about critical factors that affect aging and 
regulate life expectancy in animals. The aim of the workshop was to stimulate
