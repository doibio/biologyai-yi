(AU$ -13,100 per person; p=0.025) mainly driven by significantly reduced 
duration of all-cause hospital stay (-10 days; p=0.006). At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of AU$ 50,000 per additional QALY, the probability of HBI being 
better-valued was 96% and the incremental NMB of HBI was AU$ 24,342 (discounted, 
5%). The variables associated with increased NMB were HBI (vs. CBI), lower 
Charlson Comorbidity Index, no hyponatremia, fewer months of HF, fewer prior HF 
admissions <1 year and a higher patient's self-care confidence. HBI's net 
benefit further increased in those with fewer comorbidities, a lower self-care 
confidence or no hyponatremia.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CBI, HBI is likely to be cost-effective in elderly 
CHF patients with significant comorbidity.

The molecular understanding of crustacean metamorphosis is hindered by small 
sized individuals and inability to accurately define molt stages. We used the 
spiny lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi where the large, transparent larvae enable 
accurate tracing of the transition from a leaf-shaped phyllosoma to an 
intermediate larval-juvenile phase (puerulus). Transcriptomic analysis of larvae 
at well-defined stages prior to, during, and following this transition show that 
the phyllosoma-puerulus metamorphic transition is accompanied by vast 
transcriptomic changes exceeding 25% of the transcriptome. Notably, genes 
previously identified as regulating metamorphosis in other crustaceans do not 
fluctuate during this transition but in the later, morphologically-subtle 
puerulus-juvenile transition, indicating that the dramatic phyllosoma-puerulus 
morphological shift relies on a different, yet to be identified metamorphic 
mechanism. We examined the change in expression of domains and gene families, 
with focus on several key genes. Our research implies that the separation in 
molecular triggering systems between the phyllosoma-puerulus and 
puerulus-juvenile transitions might have enabled the extension of the oceanic 
phase in spiny lobsters. Study of similar transitions, where metamorphosis is 
uncoupled from the transition into the benthic juvenile form, in other 
commercially important crustacean groups might show common features to point on 
the evolutionary advantage of this two staged regulation.

The field of public mental health has been defined by an expert group convened 
by the Nordic School of Public Health (NHV) as encompassing the experience, 
occurrence, distribution and trajectories of positive mental health and mental 
health problems and their determinants; mental health promotion and prevention 
of mental disorders; as well as mental health system policies, governance and 
organization. The mental health priorities of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 
2010 signalled a mutual Nordic exchange of knowledge in the following thematic 
areas: child and adolescent mental health; working life and mental health; 
mental health in older people; strengthening the role of primary care in mental 
health service provision; stronger involvement of users and carers; and 
reduction of use of coercion in psychiatric care. Efforts to realize these 
priorities included commissioning the Nordic Research Academy for Mental Health, 
an NHV-based network of research institutions with a common interest in mental 
health research across the Nordic countries, to develop, organize and follow-up 
projects on public mental health. The research initiatives included mental 
health policy analysis, register-based research and research focused on the 
users' perspective in a Nordic context, as well as EU-level research policy 
analysis. The public mental health research conducted at the NHV highlighted the 
complexity of mental health and emphasized that the broad determinants of mental 
health need to be increasingly addressed in both public health research and 
practice. For example, health promotion actions, improved access to health care, 
a healthy alcohol policy and prevention of suicides and violence are all needed 
to reduce the life expectancy gap - a red flag indicator of public health 
inequalities. By exchanging knowledge and best practice, the collaboration 
between the Nordic countries contributes to the welfare of the region. The 
expertise and traditions developed at the NHV are of significant importance in 
this work.

BACKGROUND: Brazil and Canada are on opposite poles of the spectrum for life 
expectancy in America. We identified factors underlying Brazil's lower life 
expectancy relative to Canada, with emphasis on the role of injury compared with 
other major causes.
METHODS: We computed life expectancy at birth in Brazil and Canada in 2010 and 
identified the ages and causes of death responsible for the gap between both 
countries. The main outcome measure was the contribution of homicide and traffic 
accidents to the gap, compared with other causes of death.
RESULTS: Relative to Canada, life expectancy was lower in Brazil by 8.2 years 
(men) and 5.2 years (women). Injury lowered life expectancy of men in Brazil by 
2.2 years, or more than a quarter of the gap, mainly due to homicide and traffic 
accidents between ages 20 and 64 years. Homicide and traffic accidents 
contributed more than all circulatory diseases combined. In women, circulatory 
disease was the most important cause of lower life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2010, homicides and traffic accidents were the principal cause 
for short life expectancy of men in Brazil. Improving life expectancy in Brazil 
requires addressing the root causes of inequalities that drive illicit drug 
trade, violence and accidents.

BACKGROUND: The calliphorid Cynomyamortuorum (L., 1761) is a species of forensic 
interest, present mainly in the Palaearctic Region. Nearly nothing is known 
about its life history.
NEW INFORMATION: We provide here the first data regarding pupal weight evolution 
during the pupal stage, female fertility and life expectancy of the species. At 
22°C under a variable regime of temperatures, the egg-to-adult development time 
was an average of 18.05 ± 0.72 and 18.47 ± 0.67 days for females and males, 
respectively, in the control group. The pupal stage represented 56.7% of the 
total development. The development time from egg to adult and the duration of 
the pupal stage were significantly longer for males than for females. The 
measurement of pupal weight at the start of the pupal period revealed that 
female pupae were significantly lighter than male pupae by nearly 20%. This 
difference between the sexes was also observed for the dry weight of adults. An 
average decrease of 8.75% was observed throughout the first 8 days of the pupal 
stage, after which most adults started to emerge. The tested females produced an 
average of 176.13 ± 66.62 eggs throughout the egg-laying period. The average 
lifespan after emergence was 12.10 ± 4.09 days for females and 12.60 ± 2.95 days 
for males, with a median of 12.50 days for both sexes.

BACKGROUND: As the general population ages and life expectancy increases, 
health-care use by elderly people increases, including intensive care. Rationing 
and variation of access are ethically and politically challenging. We aimed to 
characterise the population-based incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions of elderly people in Scotland; compare ICU admission and mortality 
between elderly and younger populations; and compare treatment intensity between 
these groups.
METHODS: We extracted complete, national 6-year cohort Scottish ICU admissions 
(Jan 1, 2005, to Dec 31, 2010) from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit 
Group database, which we linked to hospital Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01) 
and death records. Annual incidence of ICU admissions of people aged 80 years or 
older was standardised for sex and socioeconomic status to the standard Scottish 
population (≥80 years) 2005-10. We compared mortality of elderly and younger 
people (<65 years) using the log-rank test.
FINDINGS: During 2005-10, 47 779 people were admitted to ICU (4561 patients ≥80 
years [9·5%, 35·0/10 000 population], 26 784 patients <65 years [56·1%, 
13·2/10 000]). Incidence of ICU admissions of elderly people fell from 
36·6/10 000 population (95%CI 34·0-39·2) in 2005 to 30·3/10 000 (28·0-32·5) in 
2010. ICU mortality was higher in elderly than in younger people (26·4% vs 
16·1%, p<0·0001) as was 6-year mortality (68·0% vs 34·5%, p<0·0001). 2110 (80%) 
of 2627 elderly survivors were discharged home (younger 92%, 19 221/20 902), 
with a further 373 (14·2%) given rehabilitation (younger 1063, 5·1%) (χ(2)=525, 
p<0·0001). Age was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 1·46, 95% 
CI 1·23-1·73, p<0·0001) after adjustment for confounders. In the pneumonia 
subgroup (elderly 294, younger 2167), mean acute physiology scores were similar 
(17·0 [SD 6·4] vs 17·6 [6·6]), organ support was higher in the elderly patients 
(77·0% vs 68·1%, p<0·0001), and median ICU length of stay was lower (6 days [IQR 
3-13] vs 8 [3-16], p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: This study has shown that, by contrast with previously published 
research, admission rates of elderly people in Scotland fell between 2005 and 
2010. Only the fittest elderly individuals were admitted to ICU, where initially 
they received a higher intensity of treatment than did younger patients; 
however, duration of ICU stay was shorter. Mortality rates were high, and age 
was an independent predictor of mortality.

Paulo, BR.

INTRODUCTION: Combined antiretroviral therapy has enabled human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) carriers to live longer. This increased life expectancy is 
associated with the occurrence of degenerative diseases, including 
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which are diagnosed via a 
complex neuropsychological assessment. The International HIV Dementia Scale 
(IHDS) is a screening instrument validated in Brazil for use in the absence of 
neuropsychological evaluation. HIV patients are frequently diagnosed with 
depression. We aimed to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment 
using the IHDS and depressive disorders using the Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression (HAM-D17), compare the IHDS performance with the performances on the 
Timed Gait Test (TGT), the Digit Symbol Coding Test (DS) and the Brazilian 
version of the Scale of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and 
evaluate the association between the IHDS performance and clinical-demographic 
variables.
METHODS: One hundred fourteen patients were evaluated in a cross-sectional study 
conducted in a public outpatient clinic for infectious diseases in Marília City, 
State of São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected following consultation. 
Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the nature and 
distribution of the data and hypotheses.
RESULTS: According to the IHDS, 53.2% of the sampled patients were 
neuropsychologically impaired. According to the HAM-D17, 26.3% had depressive 
disorders. There were significant associations between the IHDS and the TGT and 
DS. Multiple regression analysis indicated that female gender, educational 
level, and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) levels were significantly and 
independently associated with neurocognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of neurocognitive impairment according to the IHDS 
is high and associated with female gender, education level, and low CD4 levels.

BACKGROUND: It was previously estimated that 234·2 million operations were 
performed worldwide in 2004. The association between surgical rates and 
population health outcomes is not clear. We re-estimated global surgical volume 
to track changes over time and assess rates associated with healthy populations.
METHODS: We gathered demographic, health, and economic data for 194 WHO member 
states. Surgical volumes were obtained from published studies and other reports 
from 2005 onwards. We estimated rates of surgery for all countries without 
available data based on health expenditure in 2012 and assessed the proportion 
of surgery comprised by caesarean delivery. The rate of surgery was plotted 
against life expectancy to describe the association between surgical care and 
this health indicator.
FINDINGS: We identified 66 countries reporting surgical data between 2005 and 
2013. We estimate that 312·9 million operations (95% CI 266·2-359·5) took place 
in 2012-a 33·6% increase over 8 years; the largest proportional increase 
occurred in countries spending US$400 or less per capita on health care. 
Caesarean delivery comprised 29·8% (5·8 million operations) of the total 
surgical volume in poor health expenditure countries compared with 10·8% (7·8 
million operations) in low health expenditure countries and 2·7% (5·1 million 
operations) in high health expenditure countries. We noted a correlation between 
increased life expectancy and increased surgical rates up to 1533 operations per 
100 000 people, with significant but less dramatic improvement above this rate.
INTERPRETATION: Surgical volume is large and continues to grow in all economic 
environments. A single procedure-caesarean delivery-comprised almost a third of 
surgical volume in the most resource-limited settings. Surgical care is an 
essential part of health care and is associated with increased life expectancy, 
yet many low-income countries fail to achieve basic levels of service. 
Improvements in capacity and delivery of surgical services must be a major 
component of health system strengthening.

BACKGROUND: The global volume of surgery in 2012 is estimated at 312·9 million 
operations per year, but rates of surgery vary substantially. Maternal health 
advocates proposed minimum caesarean delivery rates for benchmarking and to 
improve perinatal outcomes; however, this has not been done for surgery because 
the association between rates of surgical care provision as a whole and 
population health outcomes have not been well described. We use available data 
to estimate minimum rates of surgery that are associated with important health 
indicators.
METHODS: We defined surgical operations as procedures done in operating theatres 
that need general or regional anaesthesia or profound sedation to control pain. 
We used four strategies to identify rates of surgery based on estimated rates of 
surgery per country for 2012 associated with life expectancy of 74-75 years; 
estimated rates of surgery associated with a maternal mortality ratio of less 
than or equal to 100 per 100 000 live births; estimated minimum need for surgery 
in the 21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions based on the prevalence of 
disorders; and surgical rates from the so-called 4C countries (Chile, China, 
Costa Rica, and Cuba) identified in The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery as 
exemplary for their achievement of high health status, despite resource 
limitations.
FINDINGS: Based on 2012 national surgical rates, countries with reported life 
expectancy of 74-75 years (n=17) had a median surgical rate of 4392 (IQR 
2897-4873) operations per 100 000 population annually. The median surgical rate 
associated with maternal mortality ratio lower than 100 (n=109) is 5028 (IQR 
4139-6778) operations per 100 000 population annually. The median surgical rate 
estimated for all 21 GBD regions was 4669 (IQR 4339-5291) operations per 100 000 
population annually. The 4C countries had a mean surgical rate of 4344 (95% CI 
2620-6068) operations per 100 000 population annually. 13 of the 21 GBD regions, 
accounting for 78% of the world's population, do not achieve the lowest end of 
the surgical rate range.
INTERPRETATION: We identified a surprisingly narrow range of surgical rates 
associated with important health indicators. This target range can be used for 
benchmarking of surgical services, and as part of a policy aimed at 
strengthening health-care systems and surgical capacity.

BACKGROUND: Surgical delivery varies 150-fold across countries. However, no 
direct correlation exists between surgical delivery and health outcomes, making 
it difficult to pinpoint a goal for surgical scale-up. We attempted to determine 
the amount of surgery that would be delivered worldwide, if the world aligned 
itself with countries providing the best health outcomes.
METHODS: The number of cases performed annually has previously been published 
for 55 countries, which we stratified by World Bank income group. Life 
expectancy, maternal mortality, under-5 mortality, adult mortality, and a 
composite outcome of the four were plotted against reported surgical delivery. 
Univariate and multivariate polynomial regression curves were fit, and the 
optimum point on each regression curve was determined by solving for first-order 
conditions. The country closest to the optimum for each health outcome was taken 
as representative of the best-performing health system. Monetary inputs to, and 
surgical procedures provided by, these health systems were scaled to the global 
population.
FINDINGS: For the five health outcomes, four countries (Sweden, Germany, 
Singapore, and Canada) performed at the optimum. Currently, 318 million 
procedures are provided annually around the world. If global surgical delivery 
mirrored delivery in the four best-performing countries, however, between 630 
million (maternal survival) and 870 million cases (composite outcome) would be 
provided annually. With population growth, this will increase to between 750 
million and 1 billion annual cases, respectively, by 2030. The best-performing 
health systems spend roughly 10% of their gross domestic product on health-care, 
providing 9000-12 000 cases per 100 000 individuals in the population.
INTERPRETATION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to provide 
empirical evidence for the surgical output that an ideal health system would 
provide. The findings in this study provide a potential goal for surgical 
scale-up around the world.

BACKGROUND The most important purpose of transplantation is to improve quality 
of life (QOL) together with increasing life expectancy. The aim of this study 
was to compare the QOL of both donors and kidney transplant recipients and a 
control group at the 3rd and 9th postoperative months by using the SF36 health 
survey, to investigate the changes in this 6-month period and to evaluate 
descriptive data and satisfaction of patients and donors. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Forty-seven donors and 47 kidney transplant recipients who were operated on in 
Diyarbakir Gazi Yasargil Training and Research Hospital between August 2012 and 
March 2015 and had been followed up for at least 9 months and 47 healthy 
controls were enrolled in the study. RESULTS Physical functioning (PF) was 
higher at the 9th postoperative month compared to the 3rd month in the recipient 
group (p=0.028). Donors had higher PF (p=0.007) and functioning physical role 
(PR; p=0.01) compared to recipients. Recipients had lower PF (p=0.016), PR 
(p=0.004), and functional-emotional role (ER; p=0.03) at the 3rd month and had 
lower PR (p=0.002) at the 9th month postoperatively comparing to the control 
group. Donors had lower PF (p=0.007) and PR (p=0.01) at the 3rd month and had 
lower PR (p=0.035) at the 9th month postoperatively comparing to the control 
group. Donors and recipients had similar QOL at the 9th month. CONCLUSIONS 
During follow-up, we observed an increase in QOL (in some subgroups) at 9 months 
postoperatively. Donors and recipients had similar QOL (except for PR) with the 
control group at the 9th month. QOL was better in younger and male patients and 
educated persons. Donors did not show any regret regarding their donation.

INTRODUCTION: Inadequate nutrition has a severe impact on health in India. 
According to the WHO, iron deficiency is the single most important nutritional 
risk factor in India, accounting for more than 3% of all disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) lost. We estimate the social costs of iron deficiency anemia 
(IDA) in 6-59-month-old children in India in terms of intangible costs and 
production losses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We build a health economic model estimating the life-time 
costs of a birth cohort suffering from IDA between the ages of 6 and 59 months. 
The model is stratified by 2 age groups (6-23 and 24-59-months), 2 geographical 
areas (urban and rural), 10 socio-economic strata and 3 degrees of severity of 
IDA (mild, moderate and severe). Prevalence of anemia is calculated with the 
last available National Family Health Survey. Information on the health 
consequences of IDA is extracted from the literature.
RESULTS: IDA prevalence is 49.5% in 6-23-month-old and 39.9% in 24-58-month-old 
children. Children living in poor households in rural areas are particularly 
affected but prevalence is high even in wealthy urban households. The estimated 
yearly costs of IDA in 6-59-month-old children amount to intangible costs of 8.3 
m DALYs and production losses of 24,001 m USD, equal to 1.3% of gross domestic 
product. Previous calculations have considerably underestimated the intangible 
costs of IDA as the improved WHO methodology leads to a threefold increase of 
DALYs due to IDA.
CONCLUSION: Despite years of iron supplementation programs and substantial 
economic growth, IDA remains a crucial public health issue in India and an 
obstacle to the economic advancement of the poor. Young children are especially 
vulnerable due to the irreversible effects of IDA on cognitive development. Our 
research may contribute to the design of new effective interventions aiming to 
reduce IDA in early childhood.

IMPORTANCE: The SQUIRE trial demonstrated that adding necitumumab to 
chemotherapy for patients with metastatic squamous cell lung cancer (mSqCLC) 
increased median overall survival by 1.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.84). However, 
the costs and value associated with this intervention remains unclear. 
Value-based pricing links the price of a drug to the benefit that it provides 
and is a novel method to establish prices for new treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the range of drug costs for which adding necitumumab to 
chemotherapy could be considered cost-effective.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a Markov model using data from 
multiple sources, including the SQUIRE trial, which compared standard 
chemotherapy with and without necitumumab as first-line treatment of mSqCLC, to 
evaluate the costs and patient life expectancies associated with each regimen. 
In the analysis, patients were modeled to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin for 
6 cycles or gemcitabine, cisplatin, and necitumumab for 6 cycles followed by 
maintenance necitumumab. Our model's clinical inputs were the survival estimates 
and frequency of adverse events (AEs) described in the SQUIRE trial. 
Log-logistic models were fitted to the survival distributions in the SQUIRE 
trial. The cost inputs included drug costs, based on the Medicare average sale 
prices, and costs for drug administration and management of AEs, based on 
Medicare reimbursement rates (all in 2014 US dollars).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) for the use of necitumumab across a range of values for its cost. Model 
robustness was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity analyses, based on 10 000 
Monte Carlo simulations, sampling values from the distributions of all model 
parameters.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the addition of necitumumab to the treatment 
regimen produced an incremental survival benefit of 0.15 life-years and 0.11 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
established that when necitumumab cost less than $563 and less than $1309 per 
cycle, there was 90% confidence that the ICER for adding necitumumab would be 
less than $100 000 per QALY and less than $200 000 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings provide a value-based range for the 
cost of necitumumab from $563 to $1309 per cycle. This study provides a 
framework for establishing value-based pricing for new oncology drugs entering 
the US marketplace.

A recent identification of the two-component aggregation pheromone of the 
invasive stink bug species, Halyomorpha halys (Stål), in association with a 
synergist, has greatly improved the ability to accurately monitor the seasonal 
abundance and distribution of this destructive pest. We evaluated the attraction 
of H. halys to black pyramid traps baited with lures containing the pheromone 
alone, the synergist methyl (2E,4E,6Z)-decatrienoate (MDT) alone, and the two 
lures in combination. Traps were deployed around areas of agricultural 
production including fruit orchards, vegetables, ornamentals, or row crops in 
Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia from mid-April to mid-October, 2012 
and 2013. We confirmed that H. halys adults and nymphs are attracted to the 
aggregation pheromone season long, but that attraction is significantly 
increased with the addition of the synergist MDT. H. halys adults were detected 
in April with peak captures of overwintering adults in mid- to late May. The 
largest adult captures were late in the summer, typically in early September. 
Nymphal captures began in late May and continued season long. Total captures 
declined rapidly in autumn and ceased by mid-October. Captures were greatest at 
locations in the Eastern Inland region, followed by those in the Eastern Coastal 
Plain and Pacific Northwest. Importantly, regardless of location in the United 
States, all mobile life stages of H. halys consistently responded to the 
combination of H. halys aggregation pheromone and the synergist throughout the 
entire season, suggesting that these stimuli will be useful tools to monitor for 
H. halys in managed systems.

The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is an 
invasive pest of sugarcane, Saccharum spp., rice, Oryza sativa L., and other 
graminaceous crops in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Traps baited 
with E. loftini female sex pheromones were used to document establishment and 
distribution of E. loftini near sugarcane, rice, and noncrop hosts in seven 
southwest Louisiana parishes from 2009 to 2013. Additional field surveys 
documented larval infestations in commercial sugarcane and rice. After its 
initial detection in 2008, no E. loftini were detected in Louisiana in 2009 and 
only two adults were captured in 2010. Trapping documented range expansion into 
Cameron, Beauregard, and Jefferson Davis parishes in 2011 and Allen, Acadia, and 
Vermilion parishes in 2013. During the course of this study, E. loftini expanded 
its range eastward into Louisiana 120 km from the Texas border (≈22 km/yr). 
Surveys of larval infestations provided the first record of E. loftini attacking 
rice and sugarcane in Louisiana. Infestations of E. loftini in rice planted 
without insecticidal seed treatments in Calcasieu Parish reached damaging 
levels.

This study investigated the dynamics of parasitism, host plant resistance, 
pathogens, and predation on the demography of wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus 
Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), developing in susceptible (hollow stem) and 
resistant (solid stem) wheat hosts. This study is also the first to investigate 
the prevalence and impact of cannibalism on wheat stem sawfly mortality. Wheat 
stem sawflies were sampled in two commercial wheat fields over 4 yr from the egg 
stage through adult emergence, and multiple decrement life tables were 
constructed and analyzed. Cannibalism, host plant resistance, or unknown factors 
were the most prevalent factors causing egg mortality. Summer mortality of 
prediapause larvae ranged from 28 to 84%, mainly due to parasitism by Bracon 
cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck, cannibalism, and host plant 
resistance. Winter mortality ranged from 6 to 54% of the overwintering larvae, 
mainly due to unknown factors or pathogens. Cannibalism is a major cause of 
irreplaceable mortality because it is absolute, with only a single survivor in 
every multiple infested stem. Subsequent to obligate cannibalism, mortality of 
feeding larvae due to host plant resistance was lower in hollow stem wheat than 
in solid stem wheat. Mortality from host plant resistance was largely 
irreplaceable. Irreplaceable mortality due to parasitoids was greater in hollow 
stem wheat than in solid stem wheat. Host plant resistance due to stem solidness 
and parasitism in hollow stems cause substantial mortality in populations of 
actively feeding larvae responsible for all crop losses. Therefore, enhancing 
these mortality factors is vital to effective integrated pest management of 
wheat stem sawfly.

Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) is a pest of potato 
(Solanum tuberosum L.) that vectors the bacterium that putatively causes zebra 
chip disease in potatoes, 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum.' Zebra chip 
disease is managed by controlling populations of B. cockerelli in commercial 
potato fields. Lacking an integrated pest management strategy, growers have 
resorted to an intensive chemical control program that may be leading to 
insecticide-resistant B. cockerelli populations in south Texas and Mexico. To 
initiate the development of an integrated approach of controlling B. cockerelli, 
we used constant temperature studies, nonlinear and linear modeling, and field 
sampling data to determine and validate the degree day parameters for 
development of B. cockerelli infesting potato. Degree day model predictions for 
three different B. cockerelli life stages were tested against data collected 
from pesticide-free plots. The model was most accurate at predicting egg-to-egg 
and nymph-to-nymph peaks, with less accuracy in predicting adult-to-adult peaks. 
It is impractical to predict first occurrence of B. cockerelli in potato 
plantings as adults are present as soon cotyledons break through the soil. 
Therefore, we suggest integrating the degree day model into current B. 
cockerelli management practices using a two-phase method. Phase 1 occurs from 
potato planting through to the first peak in a B. cockerelli field population, 
which is managed using current practices. Phase 2 begins with the first B. 
cockerelli population peak and the degree day model is initiated to predict the 
subsequent population peaks, thus providing growers a tool to proactively manage 
this pest.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of lenalidomide (Celgene) to submit evidence of the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of the drug for treating adults with myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) associated with deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality, as part of 
the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. Kleijnen Systematic 
Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was 
commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the 
company's submission, the ERG review, and the NICE's subsequent decisions. The 
ERG reviewed the evidence for clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, 
as submitted by the manufacturer to the NICE. The ERG searched for relevant 
additional evidence and validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model to 
examine the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. Clinical effectiveness 
was obtained from a three-arm, European, randomized, phase III trial among red 
blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with low-/intermediate-1-risk 
del5q31 MDS. The primary endpoint was RBC independence for ≥26 weeks, and was 
reached by a higher proportion of patients in the lenalidomide 10 and 5 mg 
groups compared with placebo (56.1 and 42.6 vs 5.9 %, respectively; both 
p < 0.001). The option of dose adjustments after 16 weeks due to dose-limiting 
toxicities or lack of response made long-term effectiveness estimates 
unreliable, e.g. overall survival (OS). The de novo model of the manufacturer 
included a Markov state-transition cost-utility model implemented in Microsoft 
Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the 
manufacturer was £56,965. The ERG assessment indicated that the modeling 
structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were 
identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. In response to the 
appraisal documentation, the company revised the economic model, which increased 
the ICER to £68,125 per quality-adjusted life-year. The NICE Appraisal Committee 
(AC) did not recommend lenalidomide as a cost-effective treatment. Subsequently, 
the manufacturer submitted a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that provided 
lenalidomide free of charge for patients who remained on treatment after 
26 cycles. This PAS improved the ICER to £25,300, although the AC considered the 
proportion of patients who received treatment beyond 26 cycles, and hence the 
ICER, to be uncertain. Nevertheless, the AC accepted a commitment from the 
manufacturer to publish, once available, data on the proportion of patients 
eligible for the PAS, and believed this provided reassurance that lenalidomide 
was a cost-effective treatment for low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the cost utility and cost 
effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic face-to-face treatment program compared with 
a telephone-based treatment program for patients with generalized osteoarthritis 
(GOA).
METHODS: An economic evaluation was carried out alongside a randomized clinical 
trial involving 147 patients with GOA. Program costs were estimated from time 
registrations. One-year medical and nonmedical costs were estimated using cost 
questionnaires. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using the 
EuroQol (EQ) classification system, EQ rating scale, and the Short Form 6D 
(SF-6D). Daily function was measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire 
(HAQ) disability index (DI). Cost and QALY/effect differences were analyzed 
using multilevel regression analysis and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves.
RESULTS: Medical costs of the face-to-face treatment and telephone-based 
treatment were estimated at €387 and €252, respectively. The difference in total 
societal costs was nonsignificantly in favor of the face-to-face program 
(difference €708; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -€5,058, €3,642). QALYs were 
similar for both groups according to the EQ, but were significantly in favor of 
the face-to-face group, according to the SF-6D (difference 0.022 [95% CI 0.000, 
0.045]). Daily function was similar according to the HAQ DI. Since both societal 
costs and QALYs/effects were in favor of the face-to-face program, the economic 
assessment favored this program, regardless of society's willingness to pay. 
There was a 65-90% chance that the face-to-face program had better cost utility 
and a 60-70% chance of being cost effective.
CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation from a societal perspective showed that a 
nonpharmacologic, face-to-face treatment program for patients with GOA was 
likely to be cost effective, relative to a telephone-based program.

alone control influenza?

BACKGROUND: The UK commenced an extension to the seasonal influenza vaccination 
policy in autumn 2014 that will eventually see all healthy children between the 
ages of 2-16 years offered annual influenza vaccination. Models suggest that the 
new policy will be both highly effective at reducing the burden of influenza as 
well as cost-effective. We explore whether targeting vaccination at either 
primary or secondary schools would be more effective and/or cost-effective than 
the current strategy.
METHODS: An age-structured deterministic transmission dynamic SEIR-type 
mathematical model was used to simulate a national influenza outbreak in 
England. Costs including GP consultations, hospitalisations due to influenza and 
vaccinations were compared to potential gains in quality-adjusted life years 
achieved through vaccinating healthy children. Costs and benefits of the new 
JCVI vaccination policy were estimated over a single season, and compared to the 
hypothesised new policies of targeted and heterogeneous vaccination.
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: All potential vaccination policies were highly 
cost-effective. Influenza transmission can be eliminated for a particular season 
by vaccinating both primary and secondary school children, but not by 
vaccinating only one group. The most cost-effective policy overall is 
heterogeneous vaccination coverage with 48% uptake in primary schools and 34% in
