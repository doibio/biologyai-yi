OBJECTIVE: Effective interventions of future health care require a better 
understanding of the health risks associated with early onset of menopause and 
diabetes, but the necessary data are scarce. Little quantitative information is 
available about the combined association of early menopause and diabetes on life 
expectancy and the number of years lived with and without diabetes.
METHODS: We included 3,650 postmenopausal women aged 45+ years from the 
Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Age at menopause 
categories were defined as follows: early (≤44 y old), normal (45-54 y old), and 
late (≥55 y old). For life table calculations, we used prevalence, incidence 
rates, and hazard ratios for three transitions (free of diabetes to diabetes, 
free of diabetes to death, and diabetes to death) stratifying by age at 
menopause categories and adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: Compared with late menopause, the difference in life expectancy for 
women who experienced early menopause was -3.5 (95% CI, -6.6 to -0.8) years 
overall and -4.6 (95% CI, -8.9 to -0.9) years without diabetes. Compared with 
age at normal menopause, the difference in life expectancy for women who 
experienced early menopause was -3.1 (95% CI, -5.1 to -1.1) years overall and 
-3.3 (95% CI, -6.0 to -0.6) years without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Women who experienced early menopause lived less long and spent 
fewer years without diabetes than women who experienced normal or late 
menopause.

This research sought to better understand local food consumers and take steps to 
begin to identify how targeted messages could engage different groups. In order 
to accomplish these aims, data was collected through a survey mailed to a random 
sample of Wisconsin households with a final sample size of 577. These consumers 
were then segmented based on variables related to the food related lifestyle 
(FRL) and political ideology. Political ideology was included as it influences 
the media to which individuals pay attention, and how they interpret messages. 
Identified groups were further profiled with variables related to local food 
purchasing, frequency of shopping at farmers' markets and natural food stores, 
willingness to pay a premium for local food, perceptions related to local food, 
communication habits, and demographics. Five segments were identified, with 
three standing out as likely consumers of local produce. The liberal, 
"Adventurous" consumers showed a strong interest in local food, perceiving local 
food to be superior for its environmental benefits, among other reasons. The 
"Traditional" and "Rational" groups were not interested in local food for 
environmental reasons, and may find such messages unappealing. In order to 
engage these other groups, messages should address the high quality of local 
food, how it can be incorporated into traditional recipes (for the "Traditional" 
group), and ways to make local food affordable and convenient to buy (for the 
"Rational" group).

The life expectancy of patients with haemophilia has increased and therefore the 
interest in age-related comorbidities has grown. The aim of this study was to 
determine whether haemophilia patients have a different endothelial function 
compared with the general population. A total of 26 patients with severe or 
moderate haemophilia A or B, 14 controls and 36 patients with coronary artery 
disease (CAD) were included in this study. Five markers of endothelial 
dysfunction (MOEDs) were determined. Moreover, the endothelial function was 
examined using the Itamar Endo-PAT, and the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) was 
calculated from the results. The MOEDs soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(p = 0.0095) and interleukin-6 (p = 0.010) were significantly higher for 
patients with haemophilia compared with the control group. The presence of 
increased adhesion molecule levels and low-grade inflammation is suggestive of a 
decreased endothelial function. RHI is impaired in CAD patients (1.862), whereas 
haemophilia patients have an RHI of 1.958 in comparison with 2.112 in controls 
(p = 0.127). Therefore, laboratory and functional measurements imply a possible 
higher risk for CAD in haemophilia patients.

Publisher: Die Lebenserwartung der Hämophilie-Patienten und das Interesse an 
altersbedingten Begleiterkrankungen ist gestiegen. Die Fragestellung war, ob 
sich die endotheliale Funktion bei Hämophilie-Patienten und der 
Allgemeinbevölkerung unterscheiden. 26 Patienten mit mittelschwerer/schwerer 
Hämophilie A/B, 36 Patienten mit Koronarer Herzkrankheit (KHK) und 14 
Normalpersonen wurden eingeschlossen. Fünf Marker für endotheliale Dysfunktion 
(MFED) wurden bestimmt. Die Endothelfunktion wurde mittels des Itamar 
Endo-PAT-Geräts gemessen und aus den Ergebnissen der Reaktive-Hyperämie-Index 
(RHI) berechnet. Bei den MFED zeigten sich signifikant höhere Werte für soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p = 0,0095*) und Interleukin-6 (p = 0,010*) 
bei Hämophilie-Patienten im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe. Das Vorhandensein von 
erhöhten Leveln von Adhäsionsmolekülen und geringgradiger Entzündung deuten auf 
eine verminderte endotheliale Funktion hin. Diese Tendenz spiegelt sich auch in 
den RHI-Ergebnissen wider (mittlerer RHI: KHK 1,862; Hämophilie 1,958; Kontrolle 
2,112; p = 0,127). Laborchemische und funktionelle Untersuchungen deuten auf ein 
mögliches höheres Risiko für KHK bei Hämophilie-Patienten hin.

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) is a health burden metric that combines 
years of life lost due to disease disability and premature mortality. The Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) has been using DALYs to determine the health burden 
associated with numerous health risks, including risks associated with dietary 
intakes, at the global and national level. To translate such information at the 
food level in the U.S., variables in What We Eat in America (WWEIA) need to be 
aligned with those in the GBD. In this paper, we develop the necessary new 
variables needed to account for differences in definitions and units between 
WWEIA and the GBD. We use the Food Patterns Equivalents Database, Food Patterns 
Equivalents Ingredient Database, Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, 
and Standard Reference databases that provide data for WWEIA to develop food 
group and nutrient variables that align with definitions and units used in the 
GBD. Considerable effort was needed to disaggregate mixed dishes to GBD 
components. We also developed a new "non-starchy" vegetable variable, since the 
GBD vegetables do not include potatoes and corn, and we report fruits and 
vegetables in grams instead of household measures. New fiber variables were 
created to avoid double counting of fiber from legumes, whole grains, fruits, 
and vegetables. Regression analyses were used to predict trans-fat content for 
foods in WWEIA with missing or incomplete information. The majority of foods in 
various U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) categories contain multiple GBD 
food groups (e.g., vegetables, whole grains, and processed meat). For most 
nutrients considered in the GBD, composition is more evenly distributed across 
the main food categories; however, seafood omega-3 fats were predominantly from 
either protein foods or mixed dishes and sugar sweetened beverages were from a 
single category. Dietary intakes in the U.S. fall short of recommendations for 
all food groups/nutrients with established theoretical minimum-risk targets in 
GBD. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that aligns WWEIA intake 
variables with those used in the health burden-based GBD reports. These methods 
will facilitate researchers to begin comparing data from the U.S. with that from 
other countries, as well as assess food sustainability performances by 
concomitantly evaluating DALYs for environmental and nutritional impacts.

Enhanced application of solid-state fermentation (SSF) in industrial production 
and the influence of SSF of Rhizopus K1 on glucoamylase productivity were 
analyzed using the flat band method. A growth model was implemented through SSF 
of Rhizopus K1 in this experiment, and spectrophotometric method was used to 
determine glucoamylase activity. Results showed that in bran and potato culture 
medium with 70% moisture in a loose state, μ of mycelium reached to 0.15 h-1 
after 45 h of culture in a thermostatic water bath incubator at 30°C. Under a 
low-magnification microscope, mycelial cells appeared uniform, bulky with 
numerous branches, and were not easily ruptured. The generated glucoamylase 
activity reached to 55 U/g (dry basis). This study has good utilization value 
for glucoamylase production by Rhizopus in SSF.

ABSTRACTIntroduction:The relationship between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 
alcohol addiction is poorly characterized. Arrests for driving under the 
influence (DUI) can serve as a proxy for alcohol addiction. Therefore, the 
potential association between DUI and AD could be helpful in understanding the 
relationship between alcohol abuse and AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, population-based cohort study using 
state health and law enforcement data was performed. The study cross-referenced 
141,281 South Carolina Alzheimer's Disease Registry cases with state law 
enforcement data.
RESULTS: Of the 2,882 registry cases (1.4%) found to have a history of at least 
one DUI arrest, cases were predominantly White (58.7%) and male (77.4%). Results 
showed a correlation coefficient of 0.7 (p &lt; 0.0001) between the age of first 
DUI arrest and the age of AD diagnosis. A dose-response relationship between the 
number of DUIs and age of AD onset was found to exist, where those with a 
history of DUI arrest were diagnosed an average of 9.1 years earlier, with a 
further 1.8 years earlier age at diagnosis in those with two or more arrests for 
DUI. A history of DUI arrest was also found to be negatively associated with 
survival after diagnosis, with a 10% decreased life expectancy in those with a 
DUI arrest history.
CONCLUSIONS: Driving under the influence, a potential indicator of alcohol 
addiction, is associated with an earlier onset of AD registry diagnosis and 
shortened survival after diagnosis. This study contributes to the growing body 
of evidence suggesting that some cases of AD are alcohol related and, possibly, 
postponable or preventable.

Highly active anti retroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically improved life 
expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, converting 
HIV infection into a chronic illness with associated changes in its attendant 
renal complications. The past two decades have witnessed a decrease in the 
prevalence of HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN), traditionally considered to be 
the hall mark of renal involvement in HIV infection. Simultaneously a host of 
other glomerular and tubulo-interstitial diseases have emerged, expanding the 
spectrum of HIV associated renal diseases, predominant among which is HIV 
associated immune complex mediated kidney diseases (HIVICK). Of the diverse 
glomerular diseases constituting HIVICK, fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) 
remains a rarity, with only two existing reports to date, confined to patients 
co-infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The pathogenetic role of HIV in these 
patients remains under a cloud because of previously well established 
association of HCV infection and FGN. We report a case of FGN in a HIV 
seropositive, HCV negative Indian patient, highlighting the diagnostic electron 
microscopy (EM) findings of FGN and strengthening the causal association of HIV 
with FGN. In view of increasing heterogeneity of renal complications in HIV 
infection, the diagnostic utility of a comprehensive renal biopsy evaluation 
inclusive of EM is emphasized for appropriate selection of treatment modalities.

Limited evidence on the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
attributable to ambient temperature. We aim to explore the association between 
ambient temperature and years of life lost (YLL), and to get a more intuitive 
understanding of the dangers of COPD in China. Death and meteorological data of 
31 Chinese provincial capital cities during 2008-2013 was analyzed in this 
study. Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) was used to estimate the 
association between ambient temperature and mortality. The attributable fraction 
(AF) to cold effect ranged from 8.19 (95%CI: -8.52,19.38) to 28.98 (95%CI: 
-64.78,67.59), while the AF to heat effect varied from 0.02 (95%CI: -0.13,0.05) 
to 5.73 (95%CI: 0.31,10.22). Cold effect was higher than heat effect on COPD in 
women and elderly, heat effect was higher in men and younger. Low temperature 
can cause more serious disease burden of COPD than high temperature.

In this study we evaluate the biotic potential and reproductive parameters of 
Spodoptera cosmioides (Walker, 1858) under controlled conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 70 
± 10% RH and 14 hour photophase). Females, on average, (14.433 days) did not 
live significantly longer than their male counterparts (13.100 days). The mean 
durations of the pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition periods were 
2.767, 10.600 and 1.067 days, respectively. The mean fecundity of females was 
5,073.533 eggs and the mean fertility was 5,021.027 larvae. On average, females 
copulated 1.167 times. Fecundity was positively correlated with the number of 
copulations (r = 0.583, P <0.001). The number of copulations, however, was 
negatively correlated whit the duration of the pre-oviposition (r = -0.560, P = 
0.007) and oviposition (r = -0.479, P = 0.048) periods, and overall longevity (r 
= -0.512, P = 0.031). The biotic potential was estimated at 6.547 x 1021 
individuals/female/year. The net reproductive rate (Ro) was 2,193.722 times per 
generation and the mean generation time (T) was 46.407 days. The intrinsic rate 
of increase (rm) was 0.166, with a finite rate of increase (λ) of 1.180, per 
week.

IMPORTANCE: Among children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival is 10% to 
20%. Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, 
represents a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, 
tisagenlecleucel is expensive, with a current list price of $475 000 per 
one-time administration.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for 
children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a 
decision analytic model was designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient 
lifetime horizon. The survival evidence for the model was extracted from 3 
studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), 
B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J 
(enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to November 30, 2015). Long-term 
survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 years with B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse were 
derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct extrapolation of 
event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published Kaplan-Meier 
curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, using an 
algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to further 
bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, 
to March 31, 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: The primary intervention of interest was tisagenlecleucel. The 
comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent clofarabine.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life-years gained, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year 
and QALY gained.
RESULTS: Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with tisagenlecleucel 
are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to treatment 
after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of $667 000, with 
discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The 
clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately $337 000, 
with discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This 
difference resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately 
$42 000 per life-year gained and approximately $46 000 per QALY gained for 
tisagenlecleucel vs clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Across scenario analyses that included more conservative 
assumptions regarding long-term relapse and survival, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $37 000 to $78 000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tisagenlecleucel likely provides gains in survival 
and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits. This study suggests 
that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models that reduce the 
risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards to ensure 
high-value care.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco control efforts implemented in the United States since the 
1960s have led to considerable reductions in smoking and smoking-related 
diseases, including lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To project reductions in tobacco use and lung cancer mortality from 
2015 to 2065 due to existing tobacco control efforts.
DESIGN: Comparative modeling approach using 4 simulation models of the natural 
history of lung cancer that explicitly relate temporal smoking patterns to lung 
cancer rates.
SETTING: U.S. population, 1964 to 2065.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 30 to 84 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Models were developed using U.S. data on smoking (1964 to 2015) 
and lung cancer mortality (1969 to 2010). Each model projected lung cancer 
mortality by smoking status under the assumption that current decreases in 
smoking would continue into the future (status quo trends). Sensitivity analyses 
examined optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.
RESULTS: Under the assumption of continued decreases in smoking, age-adjusted 
lung cancer mortality was projected to decrease by 79% between 2015 and 2065. 
Concomitantly, and despite the expected growth, aging, and longer life 
expectancy of the U.S. population, the annual number of lung cancer deaths was 
projected to decrease from 135 000 to 50 000 (63% reduction). However, 4.4 
million deaths from lung cancer are still projected to occur in the United 
States from 2015 to 2065, with about 20 million adults aged 30 to 84 years 
continuing to smoke in 2065.
LIMITATION: Projections assumed no changes to tobacco control efforts in the 
future and did not explicitly consider the potential effect of lung cancer 
screening.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco control efforts implemented since the 1960s will continue to 
reduce lung cancer rates well into the next half-century. Additional prevention 
and cessation efforts will be required to sustain and expand these gains to 
further reduce the lung cancer burden in the United States.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory 
disorder that affects synovial joints, both small and large joints, in a 
symmetric pattern. This disorder usually does not directly cause death but 
significantly reduces the quality of life and life expectancy of patients if 
left untreated. There is no cure for RA but, patients are usually on long-term 
disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to suppress the joint 
inflammation, to minimize joint damage, to preserve joint function, and to keep 
the disease in remission. RA is strongly associated with various immune cells 
and each of the cell type contributes differently to the disease pathogenesis. 
Several types of immunomodulatory molecules mainly cytokines secreted from 
immune cells mediate pathogenesis of RA, hence complicating the disease 
treatment and management. There are various treatments for RA depending on the 
severity of the disease and more importantly, the patient's response towards the 
given drugs. Early diagnosis of RA and treatment with (DMARDs) are known to 
significantly improve the treatment outcome of patients. Sensitive biomarkers 
are crucial in early detection of disease as well as to monitor the disease 
activity and progress. This review aims to discuss the pathogenic role of 
various immune cells and immunological molecules in RA. This review also 
highlights the importance of understanding the immune cells in treating RA and 
in exploring novel biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Along with increased life expectancy, the proportion of elderly 
patients with choledocholithiasis will increase and with this, the need for 
endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Current recommendations suggest 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy in all patients with choledocholithiasis to prevent 
biliary events. However, adherence to these recommendations is low, especially 
in older patients.
METHODS: Retrospective study that included non-cholecystectomized patients aged 
> =75 years who underwent ERCP for choledocholithiasis from 2013-2016 (n = 131). 
A new biliary event was defined as the need for a new ERCP, cholecystitis, 
cholangitis or gallstone pancreatitis.
AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of new biliary events and 
mortality in cholecystectomized vs non-cholecystectomized patients after ERCP.
RESULTS: Cholecystectomy was performed in 22% of the patients (92% 
laparoscopic). The post-cholecystectomy complication rate was 13% and the 
mortality rate was 7%. During the follow-up period (669 ± 487 days) a new 
biliary event occurred in 20% of patients - 10% new ERCP, 9% cholecystitis, 9% 
cholangitis and 2% pancreatitis. Cholecystectomized patients had fewer events 
(7% vs 24%, p = .048) and longer time to event (p = .016). There was no 
statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality (14% vs 27%, 
p = .13), mortality related to lithiasis (0% vs 9%, p = .11) or time to 
mortality from all causes (p = .07) and related to biliary events (p = .07).
CONCLUSIONS: In this group of elderly patients, cholecystectomy after ERCP 
prevented the occurrence of new biliary events but resulted in a 
non-statistically significant difference in mortality.

[Myelodysplastic syndromes and iron metabolism].

[Article in Japanese]

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized 
by ineffective hematopoiesis in bone marrow and cytopenias in peripheral blood. 
In patients with MDS, iron overload is frequent due to red blood cell 
transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis. Dysplastic erythroblasts in MDS 
secrete humoral factors such as erythroferrone, which suppress hepatic 
expression of hepcidin. Hepcidin is the key regulator of systemic iron 
homeostasis, and suppression of hepcidin expression leads to an increase in iron 
absorption from the intestines, exacerbating systemic iron overload. Patients 
with MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) are prone to iron overload, with most 
harboring splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) mutations in hematopoietic cells. 
SF3B1 mutations may induce ring sideroblasts by downregulating ATP binding 
cassette subfamily B member 7, which exports iron-sulfur clusters from the 
mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Iron overload in MDS causes hepatic dysfunction, 
diabetes, cardiac failure, and atherosclerosis, whereas excess iron may suppress 
normal hematopoiesis. Though randomized control studies are lacking, results 
from retrospective and cohort studies indicate that iron chelation therapy is 
appropriate for lower-risk MSD patients with transfusion-related iron overload, 
although it is not recommended for higher-risk MSD patients with short life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Aged patients with severe mental illness (SMI) suffer from a high 
risk for functional impairment and a high load of somatic comorbidities. Until 
now, there has been a lack of systematic studies on this patient population in 
later life. This review summarizes the most significant somatic comorbidities 
and discusses the consequences for the medical care of this elderly group of 
patients.
METHODS: A selective narrative review based on PubMed research and observations 
in clinical practice.
RESULTS: Life expectancy is shortened by approximately 10 years in patients with 
SMI. The main reasons are somatic comorbidities, particularly lung and 
respiratory tract disorders, metabolic syndrome with its subsequent 
cardiovascular complications, in addition to osteoporosis and fractures with a 
complicated clinical course. Although life expectancy is shortened, the number 
of geriatric patients with SMI is increasing and requires special attention to 
be given to out-patient psychosocial care, self-management of somatic diseases, 
and to age-appropriate continuation of psychiatric treatment.
CONCLUSION: The life expectancy of patients with SMI is reduced because of their 
typically somatic comorbidity, but they are reaching increasingly advanced ages 
as a consequence of improved treatment possibilities. They often require special 
attention in their diagnostic work-up and support in the management of their 
treatment. Collaborative care linking medical geriatric and geronto-psychiatric 
treatment facilities is helpful in the the interdisciplinary therapy required.

There is no comprehensive report on the burden of gastrointestinal (GI) and 
liver diseases in India. In this study, we estimated the age-standardized 
prevalence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALY) rates of GI and 
liver diseases in India from 1990 to 2016 using data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study, which systematically reviews literature and reports for 
international disease burden trends. Despite a decrease in the overall burden 
from GI infectious disorders since 1990, they still accounted for the majority 
of DALYs in 2016. Among noncommunicable disorders (NCDs), there were increases 
in the prevalence and mortality rates for pancreatitis, liver cancer, paralytic 
ileus and intestinal obstruction, gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, vascular 
intestinal disorders, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. 
Prevalence and mortality rates decreased for peptic ulcer disease, hernias, 
appendicitis, and stomach and esophageal cancer. For gastritis and duodenitis, 
cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and gallbladder and biliary tract 
diseases, there was an increase in prevalence but a decrease in mortality while 
the opposite was true for pancreatic cancer (decreased prevalence, increased 
mortality). Indian gastroenterologists and hepatologists must continue to attend 
to the large majority of patients with infectious diseases while also managing 
the increasing number of GI and liver diseases, noncommunicable nonmalignant and 
malignant.

Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are one of the earliest populations of neurons in the 
cerebral cortex of rodents and primates, and they play a critical role in 
corticogenesis and cortical lamination during neocortical development. However, 
a comprehensive morphological and physiological profile of CR cells in the mouse 
neocortex has not yet been established. Here, we systematically investigated the 
dynamic development of CR cells in Tg(Ebf2-EGFP)58Gsat/Mmcd mice. The 
morphological complexity, membrane activities and presynaptic inputs of CR cells 
coordinately increase and reach a plateau at P5-P9 before regressing. Using 3D 
reconstruction, we delineated a parallel-stratification pattern of the axonal 
extension of CR cells. Furthermore, we found that the morphological structure 
and presynaptic inputs of CR cells were disturbed in Reelin-deficient mice. 
These findings confirm that CR cells undergo a transient maturation process in 
layer 1 before disappearing. Importantly, Reelin deficiency impairs the 
formation of synaptic connections onto CR cells. In conclusion, our results 
provide insights into the rapid maturation and axonal stratification of CR cells 
in layer 1. These findings suggest that both the electrophysiological activities 
and the morphology of CR cells provide vital guidance for the modulation of 
early circuits, in a Reelin-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a key determinant of clinical outcomes. We sought to 
describe frailty among U.S. Veterans and its association with mortality.
METHODS: Nationwide retrospective cohort study of regular Veterans Affairs (VA) 
users, aged at least 65 years in 2002-2012, followed through 2014, using 
national VA administrative and Medicare and Medicaid data. A frailty index (FI) 
for VA (VA-FI) was calculated using the cumulative deficit method. Thirty-one 
age-related deficits in health from diagnostic and procedure codes were included 
and were updated biennially. Survival analysis assessed associations between 
VA-FI and mortality.
RESULTS: A VA-FI was calculated for 2,837,152 Veterans over 10 years. In 2002, 
35.5% were non-frail (FI = 0-0.10), 32.6% were pre-frail (FI = 0.11-0.20), 18.9% 
were mildly frail (FI = 0.21-0.30), 8.7% were moderately frail (FI = 0.31-0.40), 
and 4.3% were severely frail (FI > 0.40). From 2002 to 2012, the prevalence of 
moderate frailty increased to 12.7%and severe frailty to 14.1%. Frailty was 
strongly associated with survival and was independent of age, sex, race, and 
smoking; the VA-FI better predicted mortality than age alone. Although 
prevalence of frailty rose over time, compared to non-frail Veterans, 2 years' 
hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for mortality declined from a peak in 
2004 of 2.01 (1.97-2.04), 3.49 (3.44-3.55), 5.88 (5.79-5.97), and 10.39 
(10.23-10.56) for pre-frail, mildly, moderately, and severely frail, 
respectively, to 1.51 (1.49-1.53), 2.36 (2.33-2.39), 3.68 (3.63-3.73), 6.62 
(6.53-6.71) in 2012. At every frailty level, risk of mortality was lower for 
women versus men and higher for blacks versus whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affects at least 3 of every 10 U.S. Veterans aged 65 years 
and older, and is strongly associated with mortality. The VA-FI could be used to 
more accurately estimate life expectancy and individualize care for Veterans.

BACKGROUND: There are striking socioeconomic differences in life expectancy, but 
less is known about inequalities in healthy life expectancy and disease-free 
life expectancy. We estimated socioeconomic differences in health expectancies 
in four studies in England, Finland, France and Sweden.
METHODS: We estimated socioeconomic differences in health expectancies using 
data drawn from repeated waves of the four cohorts for two indicators: (i) 
self-rated health and (ii) chronic diseases (cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory 
and diabetes). Socioeconomic position was measured by occupational position. 
Multistate life table models were used to estimate healthy and chronic 
disease-free life expectancy from ages 50 to 75.
RESULTS: In all cohorts, we found inequalities in healthy life expectancy 
according to socioeconomic position. In England, both women and men in the 
higher positions could expect 82-83% of their life between ages 50 and 75 to be 
in good health compared to 68% for those in lower positions. The figures were 
75% compared to 47-50% for Finland; 85-87% compared to 77-79% for France and 
80-83% compared to 72-75% for Sweden. Those in higher occupational positions 
could expect more years in good health (2.1-6.8 years) and without chronic 
diseases (0.5-2.3 years) from ages 50 to 75.
CONCLUSION: There are inequalities in healthy life expectancy between ages 50 
and 75 according to occupational position. These results suggest that reducing 
socioeconomic inequalities would make an important contribution to extending 
healthy life expectancy and disease-free life expectancy.

Ideglira is Associated With Improved Short-Term Clinical Outcomes and Cost 
Savings Compared with Insulin Glargine U100 Plus Insulin Aspart in the U.S.

Dempsey M, Mocarski M, Langer J, Hunt B.

OBJECTIVE: In the DUAL (Dual Action of Liraglutide and Insulin Degludec in Type 
2 Diabetes) VII trial, IDegLira (a combination of insulin degludec and 
liraglutide) was compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Both 
treatment approaches achieved similar glycemic control, but there were 
differences in hypoglycemia, changes in body weight, and injection frequency. 
The aim of the present analysis was to assess the short-term cost effectiveness 
of IDegLira versus insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for treatment of 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not meeting glycemic targets on basal 
insulin in the U.S.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed to evaluate the clinical and 
economic outcomes associated with the 2 treatments over a 1-year time horizon, 
capturing the impact on quality of life of hypoglycemic events, body mass index, 
and injection frequency. Costs were captured from a healthcare payer perspective 
in 2017 U.S. dollars ($).
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with improved quality of life by 0.12 
quality-adjusted life years compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin 
aspart. The key drivers of this difference were reduced injection frequency and 
hypoglycemic events avoided. IDegLira was associated with increased annual drug 
costs, but this was entirely offset by reduced needle costs and reduced costs of 
self-monitoring of blood glucose testing. IDegLira was associated with total 
annual cost savings of $743 per patient.
CONCLUSION: IDegLira was found to improve quality-adjusted life expectancy and 
reduce costs when compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for 
treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on 
basal insulin in the U.S.
