Among the air pollutants, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less 
than 2.5 um (PM2.5) is of particular interest to environmental medicine as 
epidemiologic studies consistently reported that long-term exposure to PM2.5 is 
associated with increased risk of premature death in adults. Life expectancy is 
a well-documented and important measure of overall public health policy. 
However, few investigators examined the relationship between PM2.5 levels and 
adult life expectancy. In this Taiwan-wide study, county-level annual mean PM2.5 
concentrations data were collected concomitantly with potential confounding 
variables including demographic and socioeconomic status, as well as smoking 
prevalence. Subsequently, these PM2.5 data were analyzed with respect to 
county-level adult life expectancy data for the period 2010 to 2017. Linear 
regression was used to determine the relationship between PM2.5 and life 
expectancy in adults. Residents residing in the counties characterized as 
containing higher levels of PM2.5 exhibited significantly reduced life 
expectancy after controlling for potential confounders. For each 10 ug/m3 
increase in PM2.5 there was an estimated mean decrease in life expectancy in 
adults of 0.3 years. The results of this study shed light on the relationship 
between fine particulate air pollution exposure and risk to human health in 
Taiwan.

Mortality from cardiovascular disease is increased in people with mental health 
disorders in general and schizophrenia in particular. The causes are 
multifactorial, but it is known that antipsychotic medication can cause cardiac 
side-effects beyond the traditional coronary risk factors. Schizophrenia itself 
is a contributor to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality via cardiac 
autonomic dysfunction and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, both 
contributing to a reduced life expectancy. The pro-arrhythmic impact of 
traditional antipsychotics, especially via the hERG-potassium channel, has been 
known for several years. Newer antipsychotics have a reduced pro-arrhythmic 
profile but might contribute to higher cardiac death rates by worsening the 
metabolic profile. Clozapine-induced cardiomyopathy, which is dose independent, 
is a further concern and continuous monitoring of these patients is required. 
Prophylaxis with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is currently under 
review. Overall, management of cardiovascular risk within this population group 
must be multifaceted and nuanced to allow the most effective treatment of 
serious mental illness to be conducted within acceptable parameters of 
cardiovascular risk; some practical measures are presented for the clinical 
cardiologist.

review.

INTRODUCTION: Accurate evaluation of metastasis and life prognosis is essential 
for selecting a suitable therapeutic strategy for metastatic spine tumors owing 
to limitations in treatment options. For this purpose, various classification, 
evaluation, and scoring systems have been developed.
METHODS: Classification, evaluation, and scoring systems for metastatic spine 
tumors reported to date were identified by performing a literature search on 
PubMed. We reviewed the most cited classifications and scorings before 2009, and 
all classifications and scorings reported after 2010 from the search results.
RESULTS: Six classifications and 23 scorings were reviewed. The 
classification/evaluation methods are divided into 1) anatomical 
classification/evaluation methods, 2) evaluation methods for neurological 
symptoms/instability, and 3) scoring systems for predicting life expectancy. The 
first 2 were useful for the planning and evaluation of surgical indications. 
Scoring systems for life prognosis also permitted rough prediction of the 
outcomes and were useful for the selection of a suitable treatment. However, 
variation of the patient background, diversity of adopted prognostic factors, 
and the absence of scoring systems that could predict the outcome with an 
accuracy of 90% or higher introduced some limitations.
CONCLUSION: The identified classification, evaluation, and scoring systems have 
been generally useful for treatment strategies. However, we emphasize the 
necessity of multidisciplinary development and revision of classification and 
evaluation methods to adapt to the prolongation of survival associated with 
increased diversity and improvement of treatment options.

INTRODUCTION: We often experience recurrence of spinal metastases after 
palliative surgery, even with radiotherapy. We examined the clinical outcome of 
radical surgery containing en bloc corpectomy for patients with recurrent spinal 
metastasis.
METHODS: Seven patients underwent en bloc corpectomy for recurrent spinal 
metastases. We assessed the prognosis scores (Tomita, Tokuhashi), pre- and 
postoperative Frankel scale scores, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, 
and perioperative complications.
RESULTS: The preoperative estimated prognosis was less than six months (two 
patients), six months to one year (two patients), and over one year (three 
patients), according to Tokuhashi score. Major perioperative complications were 
dura mater injury and pleural injury. Neurological improvement was seen in four 
patients. All patients were ambulatory at discharge and lived longer than the 
preoperatively estimated life expectancy (range: seven months to four years).
CONCLUSIONS: Radical surgery consisting of en bloc corpectomy may be a 
therapeutic choice for patients with recurrent spinal metastases.

INTRODUCTION: In more than 20 years' follow-up after cervical laminoplasty, some 
patients died at an early stage, within 5 years postoperatively. The details 
remain unclear. This study was conducted to elucidate the clinical features in 
patients who died at an early stage after cervical laminoplasty to determine 
possible preventive measures against early death after surgery.
METHODS: A total of 74 patients who died with the follow-up period were 
included. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with a short 
survival period (S group, died ≤5 years after surgery) and patients with a long 
survival period (L group, died >5 years after surgery). Diseases, gender, age, 
causes of the death, general complications before surgery, and the pre- and 
postoperative JOA scores were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Eleven patients (15%) died within 5 years after laminoplasty. The 
average age at death in the S group was 68.7 years which was considerably 
younger than that in the L group (80.2 years). The ratio of pneumonia was higher 
in the S group, compared to that in the L group. Postoperative JOA score in the 
S group was lower than that in the L group.
CONCLUSIONS: 11 patients out of 74 patients (15%) died within 5 years after 
laminoplasty. The average age at the death in the S group was much younger than 
that in the L group. The postoperative JOA score in the S group was lower than 
that in the L group. As pneumonia was more prevalent in the S group, it might be 
reasonable to give the information for the protection of pneumonia after 
cervical laminoplasty.

Two patients underwent percutaneous image-guided electrochemotherapy on blastic 
spine metastases involving posterior walls of the lumbar vertebral bodies with 
epidural extension. These treatments were performed safely under cone beam 
computed tomography. Local tumor control was obtained on the subsequent 
follow-up as well as pain relief and disability improvement. Electrochemotherapy 
might be considered for patients with thus far no other alternative in order to 
obtain tumor control and improvement in patients' quality of life.

IMPORTANCE: Few adults engage in recommended levels of physical activity. 
Financial incentives can promote physical activity, but little is known about 
how the structure of these incentives influences their effectiveness (eg, how 
incentives are disbursed over time).
OBJECTIVE: To determine if it is more effective to disburse fixed total 
financial incentives at a constant, increasing, or decreasing rate to encourage 
physical activity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-week randomized clinical trial was 
conducted from June 2 to 15, 2014, using an online platform that automatically 
records daily steps of pedometer-wearing users and awards points redeemable for 
cash. The study population comprised 3515 adult users of the online platform in 
the lower 70th percentile of steps taken among all users before treatment. Data 
analyses were performed from August 20, 2014, to February 1, 2018. Analysis was 
performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to either a control group or to 1 of 
3 intervention groups during the 2 weeks of the study. Participants in the 
control group received a constant daily rate of $0.00001 per step. The 3 
intervention groups received a 20-fold incentive increase ($0.00020 per step) 
distributed differently during the 2 weeks of the study: at a constant, 
increasing, or decreasing rate. Reminder emails explaining incentive schedules 
were sent the day before the intervention and halfway through the 2-week 
intervention.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in mean daily steps during the 2-week 
intervention and 3 weeks after the intervention. The study had 80% power to 
detect a difference of 280 steps per day during the intervention at α = .05.
RESULTS: The study included 3515 participants (879 in the control condition, 879 
in the constant incentive condition, 881 in the increasing incentive condition, 
and 876 in the decreasing incentive condition). During the intervention, 
compared with participants in the control group, participants receiving constant 
incentives logged 306.7 more steps per day (95% CI, 91.5-521.9 steps; P = .005), 
those receiving decreasing incentives logged 96.9 more steps per day (95% CI, 
15.3-178.5 steps; P = .02), and those receiving increasing incentives logged no 
significant change in steps per day (1.5 steps per day; 95% CI, -81.6 to 84.7 
steps; P = .97). One week after the intervention, compared with participants in 
the control group, only participants receiving constant incentives logged 
significantly more steps per day (329.5; 95% CI, 20.6-638.4; P = .04). Two and 3 
weeks after the intervention, there were no significant differences compared 
with participants in the control group. Overall, for each $1 spent, participants 
in the constant incentives group logged 475.4 more steps than those in the 
increasing incentives group and 429.3 more steps than those in the decreasing 
incentives group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that financial incentives for 
physical activity were more effective during a payment period when they were 
offered at a constant rate rather than an increasing or decreasing rate. 
However, this effectiveness dissipated shortly after the incentives were 
removed.

Mortality Trends by Race and Ethnicity Among Adults Aged 25 and over: United 
States, 2000-2017.

Curtin SC, Arias E.

Hispanic adults in the United States have experienced lower overall mortality 
and consequently higher life expectancy than non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic 
black adults (1,2). This report presents recent trends in ageadjusted death 
rates from 2000 through 2017 for adults aged 25 and over for Hispanic, 
non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black adults, overall and by specific age 
groups (25-44, 45-64, and 65 and over).

CONTEXT: Few randomized controlled trials of advance care planning (ACP) with a 
decision aid (DA) show an effect on patient preferences for end-of-life (EOL) 
care over time, especially in racial/ethnic settings outside the U.S.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a decision 
aid consisting of a video and an ACP booklet for EOL care preferences among 
patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: Using a computer-generated sequence, we randomly assigned (1:1) 
patients with advanced cancer to a group that received a video and workbook that 
both discussed either ACP (intervention group) or cancer pain control (control 
group). At baseline, immediately after intervention, and at 7 weeks, we 
evaluated the subjects' preferences. The primary outcome was preference for EOL 
care (active treatment, life-prolonging treatment, or hospice care) on the 
assumption of a fatal disease diagnosis and the expectation of death 1) within 
1 year, 2) within several months, and 3) within a few weeks. We used Bonferroni 
correction methods for multiple comparisons with an adjusted P level of 0.005.
RESULTS: From August 2017 to February 2018, we screened 287 eligible patients, 
of whom 204 were enrolled to the intervention (104 patients) or the control (100 
patients). At postintervention, the intervention group showed a significant 
increase in preference for active treatment, life-prolonging treatment, and 
hospice care on the assumption of a fatal disease diagnosis and the expectation 
of death within 1 year (P < 0.005). Assuming a life expectancy of several 
months, the change in preferences was significant for active treatment and 
hospice care (P < 0.005) but not for life-prolonging treatment. The intervention 
group showed a significant increase in preference for active treatment, 
life-prolonging treatment, and hospice care on the assumption of a fatal disease 
diagnosis and the expectation of death within a few weeks (P < 0.005). From 
baseline to 7 weeks, the decrease in preference in the intervention group was 
not significant for active treatment, life-prolonging treatment, and hospice 
care in the intervention group in the subset expecting to die within 1 year, 
compared with the control group. Assuming a life expectancy of several months 
and a few weeks, the change in preferences was not significant for active 
treatment and for life-prolonging treatment but was significantly greater for 
hospice care in the intervention group (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: ACP interventions that included a video and an accompanying book 
improved preferences for EOL care.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Modic changes (MCs) have long been suspected as a pathologic 
cause of back pain. Although much attention has been focused on clinical 
perspectives, the etiology of MCs remains unclear. Although some studies have 
reported that sex, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, and physical 
loading may associate with MCs, the observed associations are inconsistent among 
studies.
PURPOSE: To investigate associations between MCs and lifestyle and lifetime 
occupational exposures using a general population sample.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The study was an extension of the Hangzhou Lumbar Spine Study, a 
population-based study of mainland Chinese focusing on lumbar degenerative 
changes. A total of 644 randomly selected subjects from a typical community in 
Hangzhou, Eastern China participated.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence and type of MCs in the lumbosacral spine were 
evaluated on sagittal magnetic resonance images. Demographics, lifestyle 
factors, and occupational exposures were measured using a structured interview.
METHODS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine 
the associations of MCs with various environmental exposures.
RESULTS: Among the 644 subjects (52.6±13.9 years; range 20-88 years) included in 
this study, 44.7% had MCs. In univariate regression analyses, the presence of 
MCs was associated with greater age, higher BMI, greater cigarette smoking, 
regular exercise, and absence of daily vehicle vibration. Modic changes were not 
univariately associated with sex or alcohol consumption. In addition, all 
occupational loading measurements were associated with the occurrence of MCs in 
univariate analyses, except work time spent in vehicles and work-related back 
injuries. However, in multivariate regression analyses, no statistically 
significant associations between the occurrence of MCs and lifestyle or lifetime 
occupational exposures were observed after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important determinant of MCs, with BMI and sex also 
playing a role. Lifestyle and occupational factors appear to have minor effects, 
if any, on the pathogenesis of MCs in the lumbar spine.

Females live a lot longer than males in most parts of the world today. But that 
was not always the case. We ask when and why the female advantage emerged. We 
show that reductions in maternal mortality and fertility are only partial 
reasons. Rather, the sharp reduction in infectious disease in the early 
twentieth century played a role. Those who survive most infectious diseases 
carry a health burden that affects organs and impacts general well-being. We use 
newly collected data from Massachusetts containing information on cause of death 
since 1887 to show that females between the ages of 5 and 25 were 
disproportionately affected by infectious diseases. Both males and females lived 
longer as the burden of infectious disease fell, but women were more greatly 
impacted. Our explanation does not tell us precisely why women live longer than 
men, but it does help understand the timing of their relative increase.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of stepped care compared to care 
as usual (CAU) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety 
disorders from a health sector perspective in the Australian setting.
METHOD: A decision tree model was constructed to estimate the cost per 
disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a 12-month time horizon. The 
model compared a three-step stepped care intervention to CAU. Stepped care 
included an initial phase of guided self-help, followed by face-to-face 
cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacotherapy as the final step. The model 
adopted a health sector perspective, used epidemiological parameters and 
disability weights obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Effect 
sizes were derived from a randomized trial of stepped care and a longitudinal 
cohort study. Costs were expressed in 2013 Australian dollars (A$). Multivariate 
probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Stepped care was found to be cost-effective compared to CAU with an 
incremental cost-effective ratio of A$3093 per DALY averted. One-hundred percent 
of the uncertainty iterations fell below the A$50,000 per DALY averted 
willingness-to-pay threshold commonly used in Australia. The evaluation was most 
sensitive to changes in diagnosis rates and effect sizes.
CONCLUSION: A three-step model of stepped care appears to be cost-effective for 
the treatment of adults with mild to moderate anxiety disorders from the 
Australian health sector perspective. These results can provide some assurance 
to decision-makers that stepped care represents an efficient use of health care 
resources.

Injection Molded Liquid Crystal Polymer Package for Chronic Active Implantable 
Devices With Application to an Optogenetic Stimulator.

Au SLC, Chen FB, Budgett DM, Malpas SC, Guild SJ, McCormick D.

Implanted electronics require protection from the body's fluids to avoid 
moisture induced failure. This study presents an injection molded liquid crystal 
polymer (LCP) package to protect active implantable devices for chronic 
applications, such as in optogenetic research. The technology is applied and 
assessed through a custom package for a fully implantable optogenetic 
stimulation system, built on a versatile telemetry system that can incorporate 
additional stimulating and recording channels. An adapted quasi-steady state 
model predicts the lifetime of an enclosure, where the definition of the 
lifetime is the time before the internal relative humidity (RH) reaches a time 
constant, or 63%RH, a conservative limit to minimize the risk of corrosion. The 
lifetime of the LCP optogenetic device is 94 days, and can be extended to 326 
days with the inclusion of 5% w/v silica gel desiccant. Samples of the LCP 
optogenetic device containing humidity sensors testing in saline at 38 °C 
support the RH change predictions. Desiccants inside the implant enclosure can 
store permeating moisture and prolong the life expectancy of LCP-based implants 
to years or decades. The results of this study demonstrates the feasibility of 
providing reliable protection for chronic optogenetic implants, and the 
technology can be transferred to other applications as an easily-manufactured, 
cost-effective, radiofrequency compatible alternative to hermetic packaging for 
chronic studies.

A Comparison of Visualizations for Identifying Correlation over Space and Time.

Pena-Araya V, Pietriga E, Bezerianos A.

Observing the relationship between two or more variables over space and time is 
essential in many domains. For instance, looking, for different countries, at 
the evolution of both the life expectancy at birth and the fertility rate will 
give an overview of their demographics. The choice of visual representation for 
such multivariate data is key to enabling analysts to extract patterns and 
trends. Prior work has compared geo-temporal visualization techniques for a 
single thematic variable that evolves over space and time, or for two variables 
at a specific point in time. But how effective visualization techniques are at 
communicating correlation between two variables that evolve over space and time 
remains to be investigated. We report on a study comparing three techniques that 
are representative of different strategies to visualize geo-temporal 
multivariate data: either juxtaposing all locations for a given time step, or 
juxtaposing all time steps for a given location; and encoding thematic 
attributes either using symbols overlaid on top of map features, or using visual 
channels of the map features themselves. Participants performed a series of 
tasks that required them to identify if two variables were correlated over time 
and if there was a pattern in their evolution. Tasks varied in granularity for 
both dimensions: time (all time steps, a subrange of steps, one step only) and 
space (all locations, locations in a subregion, one location only). Our results 
show that a visualization's effectiveness depends strongly on the task to be 
carried out. Based on these findings we present a set of design guidelines about 
geo-temporal visualization techniques for communicating correlation.

The study aimed to develop and evaluate a multicomponent school and home based 
physical activity (PA) intervention in children in grades 3-7 (aged 8-13 years) 
and determine the psychological variables that influence PA; 10 × 1 h 
school-based training sessions, a home-based activity program and 4 × 1 h 
lifestyle workshops for parents. PA was assessed at an intervention and nearby 
control school using accelerometers and self-report at 3-time points: baseline, 
post intervention and 10-week follow-up. Self-efficacy, self-management 
strategies, enjoyment, perceived barriers to PA, outcome-expectancy and social 
support were evaluated. The study showed 73% of the children with complete data 
sets at the intervention school (n = 27) did not increase device measured 
moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) in the after-school period (3 p.m. to 6 p.m.) or 
over the whole day or during school break time immediately following the 
intervention or at follow-up, as compared to 70% of children with complete data 
sets at the control school (n = 35; p > 0.05 for all). Overall, 59% of boys 
attained more than double the recommended 120 min of MVPA each day compared to 
42% of girls (p = 0.013). At the baseline, children's self-reported PA in the 
intervention school positively correlated with: outcome expectancy (R = 0.240, p 
= 0.015), enjoyment (R = 0.339, p < 0.001), self-efficacy (R = 0.399, p < 
0.001), self-management (R = 0.617, p < 0.001), social support at home (R = 
0.406, p < 0.001), and social support at school (R = 0.407, p < 0.001). Similar 
relationships were observed after the intervention and at follow-up. Focus 
groups with the children, parents and interviews with teachers identified areas 
for improvement of the intervention. In conclusion, while the multifaceted 
approach to improve PA was ineffective over the time span of the study, 
important predictors of PA in this sample of disadvantaged children were 
identified.

Cardiac Pathophysiology and the Future of Cardiac Therapies in Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease featuring skeletal 
muscle wasting, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy. Historically, 
respiratory failure has been the leading cause of mortality in DMD, but recent 
improvements in symptomatic respiratory management have extended the life 
expectancy of DMD patients. With increased longevity, the clinical relevance of 
heart disease in DMD is growing, as virtually all DMD patients over 18 year of 
age display signs of cardiomyopathy. This review will focus on the 
pathophysiological basis of DMD in the heart and discuss the therapeutic 
approaches currently in use and those in development to treat dystrophic 
cardiomyopathy. The first section will describe the aspects of the DMD that 
result in the loss of cardiac tissue and accumulation of fibrosis. The second 
section will discuss cardiac small molecule therapies currently used to treat 
heart disease in DMD, with a focus on the evidence supporting the use of each 
drug in dystrophic patients. The final section will outline the strengths and 
limitations of approaches directed at correcting the genetic defect through 
dystrophin gene replacement, modification, or repair. There are several new and 
promising therapeutic approaches that may protect the dystrophic heart, but 
their limitations suggest that future management of dystrophic cardiomyopathy 
may benefit from combining gene-targeted therapies with small molecule 
therapies. Understanding the mechanistic basis of dystrophic heart disease and 
the effects of current and emerging therapies will be critical for their success 
in the treatment of patients with DMD.

BACKGROUND: Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
that causes deficiency or dysfunction of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 
protein. Not only AT patients, but also certain ATM heterozygous mutation 
carriers show a significantly reduced life expectancy due to cancer and ischemic 
heart disease; in particular, female carriers having particular alleles have an 
increased risk of breast cancer. The frequency of such risk heterozygotes at a 
population level remains to be fully determined, and evidence-based preventive 
medical guidelines have not yet been established.
METHODS: Using the 3.5KJPNv2 allele frequency panel of Japanese Multi Omics 
Reference Panel v201902, which shows single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and 
insertion/deletion (INDEL) allele frequencies from 3552 Japanese healthy 
individuals, we investigated the diversity of ATM gene variants.
RESULTS: We detected 2845 (2370 SNV and 475 INDEL) variants in the ATM gene, 
including 1338 (1160 SNV and 178 INDEL) novel variants. Also, we found a 
stop-gained SNV (NC_000008.11:g.108115650G > A (p.Trp266*)) and a 
disruptive-inframe-deletion (NC_000008.11:g. 108181014AAGAAAAGTATGGATGATCAAG/A 
(p.Ala1945_Phe1952delinsVal) and two frameshift INDELs 
(NC_000008.11:g.108119714CAA/C (p.Glu376fs) and NC_000008.11:g.108203577CTTATA/C 
(p.Ile2629fs)), which would be novel variants predicted to lead to loss of ATM 
functionality.
CONCLUSION: The combination of population-based biobanking and human genomics 
provided a novel insight of diversity of ATM gene variants at a population 
level. For the advancement of precision medicine, such approach will be useful 
to predict novel pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the ATM gene and to 
establish preventive medical guidelines for certain ATM heterozygotes pertaining 
to their risk of particular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is hyper-endemic in China, it is 
characterized with a high morbidity of fulminant hepatitis and mortality in 
pregnant women. The first hepatitis E vaccine, HEV 239, was licensed in China in 
2011 which provides an effective preventive measure.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with HEV 239 in 
women of childbearing age in China and whether HEV antibody screening should be 
considered before vaccination.
METHODS: A decision tree-Markov model was constructed to simulate HEV infection 
in a closed female cohort with an average first-marriage age of 25 years and 
evaluate health and economic outcomes of two potential vaccination strategies, 
direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination, from a societal 
perspective. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, additional costs per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) was calculated for each 
vaccination strategy versus no vaccination and between two vaccination 
strategies. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
assess the robustness of the model findings.
RESULTS: ICERs of direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination 
versus no vaccination were $4040 and $3114 per DALY averted, respectively, much 
lower than 1-time Chinese per-capita GDP ($8127). Direct vaccination would need 
additional $45,455 for each DALY averted compared with combined screening and 
vaccination, far more than the 3-time per-capita GDP. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses confirmed our findings that two vaccination strategies would be 
cost-effective if the willingness-to-pay reached the 1-time per-capita GDP, and 
that combined screening and vaccination would be more cost-effective than direct 
vaccination strategy.
CONCLUSION: Vaccinating women of childbearing age with HEV 239 would cost less 
than the 1-time per-capita GDP for each DALY averted in China, and the 
vaccination with a prior screening would be the optimal option.

This study reports that a high concentration of the endo-β-1,3-glucanase ENG 
(200 μg ml-1) induced heat-inactivated stipe wall extension of Coprinopsis 
cinerea, whereas a high concentration of the extracellular β-glucosidase BGL2 
(1,000 μg ml-1) did not; however, in combination, low concentrations of ENG 
(25 μg ml-1) and BGL2 (260 μg ml-1) induced heat-inactivated stipe cell wall 
extension. In contrast to the previously reported chitinase-reconstituted stipe 
wall extension, β-1,3-glucanase-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe cell wall 
extension initially exhibited a fast extension rate that quickly decreased to 
zero after approximately 60 min; the stipe cell wall extension induced by a high 
concentration of β-1,3-glucanase did not result in stipe breakage during 
measurement, and the inner surfaces of glucanase-reconstituted extended cell 
walls still remained as amorphous matrices that did not appear to have been 
damaged. These distinctive features of the β-1,3-glucanase-reconstituted wall 
extension may be because chitin chains are cross-linked not only to the 
nonreducing termini of the side chains and the backbones of β-1,6 branched 
β-1,3-glucans but also to other polysaccharides. Remarkably, a low concentration 
of either the β-1,3-glucanase ENG or of chitinase ChiE1 did not induce 
heat-inactivated stipe wall extension, but a combination of these two enzymes, 
each at a low concentration, showed stipe cell wall extension activity that 
exhibited a steady and continuous wall extension profile. Therefore, we 
concluded that the stipe cell wall extension is the result of the synergistic 
actions of glucanases and chitinases.IMPORTANCE We previously reported that the 
chitinase could induce stipe wall extension and was involved in stipe elongation 
growth of the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea In this study, we explored that 
β-1,3-glucanase also induced stipe cell wall extension. Interestingly, the 
extension profile and extended ultra-architecture of 
β-1,3-glucanase-reconstituted stipe wall were different from those of 
chitinase-reconstituted stipe wall. However, β-1,3-glucanase cooperated with 
chitinase to induce stipe cell wall extension. The significance of this synergy 
between glucanases and chitinases is that it enables a low concentration of 
active enzymes to induce wall extension, and the involvement of β-1,3-glucanases 
is necessary for the cell wall remodeling and the addition of new β-glucans 
during stipe elongation growth.

BACKGROUND: Bone metastases are the most common malignant bone tumours and most 
commonly occur in the spine, pelvis, proximal femur and proximal humerus. 
Prostate and breast cancer most often metastasize to the bone.
DIAGNOSTICS: In patients with a history of tumours and local unspecific pain in 
the back and extremities, further diagnostic examinations should be performed. 
For the initial diagnosis a conventional radiograph of the whole bone in 
two planes is sufficient. For further diagnostics, the imaging may be 
supplemented with CT, MRI, scintigraphy and a PET-CT (PET-MRI) if the findings 
are not inconspicuous on the x‑ray. An indication for biopsy exists if the tumor 
cannot be classified, especially in solitary findings with or without previous 
tumor anamnesis.
THERAPY: Surgical indications for bone metastases are a pathological fracture, 
an impending fracture, a solitary late metastasis, radiation-resistant 
osteolysis and therapy-resistant pain. In solitary metastases, the prognosis for 
patients can be significantly improved by a wide (R0 resection) depending on the 
primary tumour. For multiple metastases the restoration of mobility and 
improvement of the quality of life are in the foreground. Depending on the life 
expectancy and other factors, such as the location of the metastases 
osteosynthesis, implantations of dual head prothesis, total joint arthroplasty 
and tumor endoprostheses can be performed.

BACKGROUND: Cladribine tablets have recently become available in The Netherlands 
for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as a 
disease-modifying agent that reduces the frequency and severity of relapses and
