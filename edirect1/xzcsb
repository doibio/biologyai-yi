PURPOSE: Imaging is crucial for management of patients with possible cerebral 
venous thrombosis (CVT). To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different 
noninvasive imaging strategies in patients with possible CVT.
METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with the following imaging 
strategies: non-contrast CT (NCCT), NCCT plus CT venography (CTV), routine MRI 
without vascular imaging (R-MRI), and MRI with venography (MRV). The analysis 
was performed from a US healthcare perspective. Model input was based on best 
available and most recent evidence, including outcome data from the 
International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT). 
Starting age was 37 years; both high and low pre-test probabilities of CVT were 
evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) estimated model uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, NCCT and CTV were dominant over R-MRI and 
MRV. CTV led to incremental lifetime QALYs compared with NCCT (23.385 QALYs vs. 
23.374 QALYs) at slightly higher lifetime costs ($5210 vs. $5057). In PSA, CTV 
was the strategy with the highest percentage of cost-effective iterations if 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were higher than $13,750/QALY. Complying 
with contemporary WTP thresholds, CTV was thus identified as the most 
cost-effective strategy. When the pre-test probability was set to 50%, CTV was 
also preferred.
CONCLUSION: In patients at the peak age of CVT incidence yet low clinical 
pre-test probability, diagnostic imaging with CTV is the most cost-effective 
strategy.

Regular resistance exercise is associated with metabolic, neuromuscular and 
cardiovascular adaptations which improve quality of life and health. However, 
sedentary subjects have shown acute impairments in endothelial function after 
high-intensity resistance exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
endothelial function in sedentary middle-aged men after a single session of 
resistance exercise at different intensities. Eleven sedentary middle-aged men 
(40.1 ± 3.9 years; 27.3 ± 1.4 kg/m2) underwent three different conditions of 
assessment: (1) single knee extension exercise at moderate intensity (MI) [4 
sets of 12 repetitions at 50% of one repetition maximum (1RM) for each leg], (2) 
single knee extension exercise at high intensity (HI) (4 sets of 8 repetitions 
at 80% of 1RM for each leg), (3) resting for the control condition (CON). 
Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed before, 30 and 60 min after exercise. 
Plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitrites and nitrates (NOx) and 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured before, 
immediately after and 60 min after exercise. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 
prior to the experimental protocols, and in the following times: immediately 
following, and 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min after exertion. There was a 
significant improvement in FMD 30 min after MI condition (12.5 ± 4.10 vs. 17.2 ± 
3.9%; p = 0.016). NOx levels were significantly higher immediately after MI (6.8 
± 3.3 vs. 12.6 ± 4.2 μM; p = 0.007) and there was a significant increase in the 
concentration of ET-1 immediately after HI (20.02 ± 2.2 vs. 25.4 ± 2.1 pg/mL; p 
= 0.004). However, there was no significant difference for BP (MI vs. HI) and 
TBARS among the experimental conditions. Resistance exercise performed at 
moderate intensity improved vasodilatation via increases on NOx levels and FMD 
in sedentary middle-aged men.

Obesity, a chronic multifaceted disease, predisposes its patients to increased 
risk of metabolic disorders such as: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, 
dyslipidemia, etc. Recent studies reported it to be amongst the leading causes 
of deaths in the world. Although several treatment options for obesity abound, 
many of them have not been able to successfully reverse the existing obesity and 
metabolic dysregulation. This has therefore warranted the need for either 
alternative therapies or diversification of the treatment approach for obesity 
and its comorbidity. When the receptor for advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE) interacts with its ligand, RAGE-ligand activates an inflammatory 
signaling cascade, that leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB) and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. This action has been 
associated with the development of obesity and its mediated metabolic 
dysregulation. In view of the increasing prevalence of obesity globally and the 
potential threat it places on life expectancy, this article reviewed the 
promising potentials of targeting endogenous secretory receptor for advanced 
glycation end products/soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products 
signaling as a treatment approach for obesity. We carried out a literature 
search in several electronic data bases such as: Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Google, 
Google Scholar, Scopus, and Medline from 1980 to 2019 to acquire the status of 
information concerning this. The article suggests the need for the development 
of an esRAGE/sRAGE targeted pharmacotherapy as a treatment approach for obesity 
and its comorbidity.

INTRODUCTION: Hypogonadism is more prevalent in men with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
(25%-40%) than in men without T2DM. Hypogonadism has been associated with poorer 
glycaemic outcomes and increased cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. We report a 
14-year follow-up study to evaluate the influence of baseline testosterone level 
on T2DM outcomes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 550 men with T2DM underwent baseline 
total testosterone and dihydrotestosterone measurement by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Mean age of the men was 59.7 ± 12 (mean ± SD) years. Sex 
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was measured and free testosterone estimated. 
Patients were followed up between 2002 and 2016. Mean follow-up period was 
12.2 ± 4 years using the Salford (UK) Integrated Health Records system.
RESULTS: Mean baseline total testosterone was 13.7 ± 5.8 nmol/L, and mean free 
testosterone was 245.7 ± 88.0 pmol/L. Mean for low total testosterone 
(<10 nmol/L) was 7.6 ± 2.0 nmol/L (n = 154) and 142 men had a free testosterone 
<190 pmol/L. During the 14-year duration follow-up, 22% of men experienced a 
myocardial infarction, 18% experienced a stroke, 11% developed angina, 14% 
underwent coronary revascularization. About 38% of the men initially recruited 
died. A lower total testosterone was associated with a higher body mass index 
(kg/m2) at follow-up: regression coefficient -0.30 (95% CI -0.445 to -0.157), 
P = 0.0001. The mortality rate was higher in patients with lower total 
testosterone compared to normal baseline total testosterone (5.0% vs 2.8% per 
year, P < 0.0001). A similar phenomenon was seen for dihydrotestosterone (4.3% 
vs 2.9% per year, P = 0.002) for normal vs low dihydrotestosterone) and for 
lower SHBG. Over the whole follow-up period 36.1% (143/396), men with normal 
baseline testosterone died vs 55.8% (86/154) of hypogonadal men at baseline. In 
Cox regression, the age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for higher mortality 
associated with low total testosterone was 1.54 (95% CI: 1.2-2.0, P < 0.002), 
corresponding to a 3.2 year reduced life expectancy for hypogonadal T2DM men.
CONCLUSION: Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels are associated with 
higher all-cause mortality in T2DM men. Hypogonadal men with T2DM should be 
considered as very high risk for cardiovascular events/death.

Canada has among the highest incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) in the world. After decades of rising incidence of IBD in Canada 
during the 20th Century, the prevalence of IBD in 2018 is 0.7% of the Canadian 
population. Forecasting models predict that prevalence of IBD will continue to 
rise to 1.0% of the population by 2030. In 2018, the number of Canadians living 
with IBD is approximately 270,000 and is predicted to rise to 403,000 Canadians 
in 2030. Inflammatory bowel disease affects all age groups with adolescents and 
young adults at highest risk of diagnosis. Canadians of all ethnicities are 
being diagnosed with IBD including known high-risk groups such as Ashkenazi Jews 
and offspring of South Asian immigrants who were previously thought to be low 
risk. Moreover, IBD has evolved into a global disease with rising incidence in 
newly industrialized countries in Asia and South America. The causes of IBD 
remain unsolved; however, the high rates of disease in Western countries and its 
emergence in newly industrialized countries suggest that environmental factors 
associated with urbanization, modernization, or Western diets may be pertinent 
to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: 1. Canada continues to have among the highest prevalence of IBD in 
the world.2. Today, approximately 270,000 Canadians live with IBD. By 2030 it is 
estimated that nearly 403,000 Canadians will have a diagnosis of IBD.3. 
Inflammatory bowel disease has become a worldwide disease with increasing rates 
in Asia, Africa, and South America-continents where IBD was rarely diagnosed 
prior to 1990.4. The causes of IBD are unknown, but the high rates of disease 
over the past 60 years in Western countries and the emergence of disease in 
developing countries suggest that factors associated with urbanization, 
modernization, or Western diets may be pertinent to understanding the 
pathogenesis of the disease.5. Many of the leading hypotheses as to the causes 
of IBD tie in with alteration of the gut microbiome, the suite of organisms that 
reside in the bowel and maintain bowel health throughout life.
KEY SUMMARY POINTS: 1. The incidence (the number of new diagnoses annually) of 
IBD rose throughout the 20th century in Canada and then stabilized at the turn 
of the 21st century.2. The prevalence (the total number of diagnosed persons in 
the population) of IBD in Canada is among the highest in the world.3. Today, 
270,000 (0.7%, or 7 in 1000) Canadians are estimated to live with IBD. By 2030, 
that number is expected to rise to 403,000 Canadians (1% or 1 in 100).4. 
Inflammatory bowel disease can be diagnosed at any age. However, the age groups 
that are most likely to be diagnosed are adolescents and young adults from 20 to 
30 years of age.5. Inflammatory bowel disease in Canada affects the lives of 
Canadians of all ethnicities, including known high-risk groups such as Ashkenazi 
Jews, and those thought previously to be at low risk, such as first-generation 
offspring of South Asian immigrants.6. Canadian health policy makers will need 
to prepare the Canadian health care system for the rising burden of IBD.7. As 
newly industrialized countries in Asia, Africa, and South America are 
transitioning to a Westernized society, IBD has emerged and its incidence in 
these countries is rising rapidly.8. The gut microbiome includes microorganisms 
that maintain digestive health. Thus, changes in the microbiome, which may 
change the immune system's response to triggers, may be important in initiating 
and perpetuating IBD.9. A number of factors can alter the gut microbiome and 
early childhood may be a particularly important time such that breastfeeding, 
early life diet, use of antibiotics, infections, and other environmental 
exposures may impact the gut microbiome in such a way that facilitates 
developing IBD.10. Smoking is associated with an increased risk and worsening 
disease course of Crohn's disease. Quitting smoking is associated with an 
increased risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Therefore, never initiating 
smoking can mitigate the risk for IBD. Educational programs aimed at those 
at-risk for IBD should emphasize the risk of starting to smoke tobacco.11. 
Modifying exposure to environmental risk factors associated with the 
Westernization of society (e.g., Western diet and lifestyles) may provide an 
avenue for reducing the risk of IBD in Canada and worldwide.
GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: 1. While the incidence of IBD appears 
to be stabilizing in some regions in Canada, IBD may be occurring more 
frequently in certain populations such as in children, South Asians, Ashkenazi 
Jews, and immigrants. Future research should focus on the changing demographics 
of IBD in Canada.2. The prevalence of IBD will rise steadily over the next 
decade. To enable better health care system planning and to respond adequately 
to the increasing burden of IBD, ongoing surveillance of the epidemiology and 
health services utilization of IBD in Canada is necessary.3. Most studies have 
focused on the mortality associated with IBD. Future research is necessary to 
assess health-adjusted life expectancy and overall life expectancy for those 
living with IBD.4. Analyses of resources, infrastructure, and personnel need to 
be modeled into the future in order to prepare our health care system for the 
rising burden of IBD.5. Research on the interaction between genes, microbes, and 
our environment will inform our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, 
information necessary to prevent IBD in the future.

Untreated urban runoff poses significant water quality threats to aquatic 
organisms. In northwestern North America, ongoing development in coastal 
watersheds is increasing the transport of toxic chemical contaminants to river 
and stream networks that provide spawning and rearing habitats for several 
species of Pacific salmon. Adult coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are particularly 
vulnerable to a stormwater-driven mortality syndrome. The phenomenon may 
prematurely kill more than half of the coho that return each fall to spawn in 
catchments with a high degree of imperviousness. Here we evaluate the coho 
mortality syndrome at the juvenile life stage. Freshwater-stage juveniles were 
exposed to stormwater collected from a high traffic volume urban arterial 
roadway. Symptoms characteristic of the mortality syndrome were evaluated using 
digital image analysis, and discrete stages of abnormal behavior were 
characterized as the syndrome progressed. At a subset of these stages, blood was 
analyzed for ion homeostasis, hematocrit, pH, glucose, and lactate. Several of 
these blood chemistry parameters were significantly dysregulated in symptomatic 
juvenile coho. Affected fish did not recover when transferred to clean water, 
suggesting a single runoff event to stream habitats could be lethal if resident 
coho become overtly symptomatic. Among coho life stages, our findings indicate 
the urban runoff mortality syndrome is not unique to adult spawners. Therefore, 
the consequences for wild coho populations in developing watersheds are likely 
to be greater than previously anticipated.

Suicide is an important public health problem. The most frequent psychiatric 
illnesses associated with suicide or severe suicide attempt are mood and 
psychotic disorders. The purpose of this paper is to provide an educational 
overview of suicidal behavior in individuals with schizophrenia. A lifetime 
suicide rate in individuals with schizophrenia is approximately 10%. Suicide is 
the largest contributor to the decreased life expectancy in individuals with 
schizophrenia. Demographic and psychosocial factors that increase a risk of 
suicide in individuals with schizophrenia include younger age, being male, being 
unmarried, living alone, being unemployed, being intelligent, being 
well-educated, good premorbid adjustment or functioning, having high personal 
expectations and hopes, having an understanding that life's expectations and 
hopes are not likely to be met, having had recent (i.e., within past 3 months) 
life events, having poor work functioning, and having access to lethal means, 
such as firearms. Throughout the first decade of their disorder, patients with 
schizophrenia are at substantially elevated suicide risk, although they continue 
to be at elevated suicide risk during their lives with times of worsening or 
improvement. Having awareness of symptoms, especially, awareness of delusions, 
anhedonia, asociality, and blunted affect, having a negative feeling about, or 
non-adherence with, treatment are associated with greater suicide risk in 
patients with schizophrenia. Comorbid depression and a history of suicidal 
behavior are important contributors to suicide risk in patients with 
schizophrenia. The only reliable protective factor for suicide in patients with 
schizophrenia is provision of and compliance with comprehensive treatment. 
Prevention of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia should include recognizing 
patients at risk, delivering the best possible therapy for psychotic symptoms, 
and managing comorbid depression and substance misuse.

Vascular complications are among the most serious manifestations of diabetes. 
Atherosclerosis is the main cause of reduced life quality and expectancy in 
diabetics, whereas diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are the most common 
causes of end-stage renal disease and blindness. An effective therapeutic 
approach to prevent vascular complications should counteract the mechanisms of 
injury. Among them, the toxic effects of Advanced Glycation (AGEs) and 
Lipoxidation (ALEs) end-products are well-recognized contributors to these 
sequelae. L-carnosine (β-alanyl-Lhistidine) acts as a quencher of the AGE/ALE 
precursors Reactive Carbonyl Species (RCS), which are highly reactive aldehydes 
derived from oxidative and non-oxidative modifications of sugars and lipids. 
Consistently, L-carnosine was found to be effective in several disease models in 
which glyco/lipoxidation plays a central pathogenic role. Unfortunately, in 
humans, L-carnosine is rapidly inactivated by serum carnosinase. Therefore, the 
search for carnosinase-resistant derivatives of Lcarnosine represents a suitable 
strategy against carbonyl stress-dependent disorders, particularly diabetic 
vascular complications. In this review, we present and discuss available data on 
the efficacy of L-carnosine and its derivatives in preventing vascular 
complications in rodent models of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We also 
discuss genetic findings providing evidence for the involvement of the 
carnosinase/L-carnosine system in the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy 
and for preferring the use of carnosinase-resistant compounds in human disease. 
The availability of therapeutic strategies capable to prevent both long-term 
glucose toxicity, resulting from insufficient glucoselowering therapy, and 
lipotoxicity may help reduce the clinical and economic burden of vascular 
complications of diabetes and related metabolic disorders.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine whether 3 sessions per week of 
acupuncture treatment is superior to 1 session per week of acupuncture treatment 
for symptomatic outcomes in knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized 
controlled trial. Sixty patients with knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence 
grade II or III) will be recruited and randomly allocated to receive 24 or 8 
sessions (group M or group L) of acupuncture treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Patients 
in group M will receive 3 sessions per week of acupuncture for 8 weeks. Patients 
in group L will receive acupuncture once per week for 8 weeks. The primary 
outcome is the response rate-the percentage of patients achieving a decrease ≥ 2 
points on a numerical rating pain scale and a decrease ≥ 6 points in the Western 
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function score at 8 weeks 
compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include pain, function, overall 
effect, quality of life, and treatment credibility and expectancy.
DISCUSSION: Three sessions per week of acupuncture treatment may be superior to 
1 session per week of acupuncture treatment for symptomatic outcomes in knee

BACKGROUND: Pathological complete response to preoperative treatment in adults 
with soft-tissue sarcoma can be achieved in only a few patients receiving 
radiotherapy. This phase 2-3 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 
hafnium oxide (HfO2) nanoparticle NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy versus 
radiotherapy alone as a pre-operative treatment in patients with locally 
advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.
METHODS: Act.In.Sarc is a phase 2-3 randomised, multicentre, international 
trial. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma of the 
extremity or trunk wall, of any histological grade, and requiring preoperative 
radiotherapy were included. Patients had to have a WHO performance status of 0-2 
and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1) by an interactive web response system to receive either NBTXR3 (volume 
corresponding to 10% of baseline tumour volume at a fixed concentration of 
53·3 g/L) as a single intratumoural administration before preoperative 
external-beam radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) or radiotherapy alone, 
followed by surgery. Randomisation was stratified by histological subtype 
(myxoid liposarcoma vs others). This was an open-label study. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of patients with a pathological complete response, 
assessed by a central pathology review board following European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines in the intention-to-treat population 
full analysis set. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at 
least one puncture and injection of NBTXR3 or at least one dose of radiotherapy. 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02379845, and is 
ongoing for long-term follow-up, but recruitment is complete.
FINDINGS: Between March 3, 2015, and Nov 21, 2017, 180 eligible patients were 
enrolled and randomly assigned and 179 started treatment: 89 in the NBTXR3 plus 
radiotherapy group and 90 in the radiotherapy alone group. Two patients in the 
NBTXR3 group and one patient in the radiotherapy group were excluded from the 
efficacy analysis because they were subsequently discovered to be ineligible; 
thus, a total of 176 patients were analysed for the primary endpoint in the 
intention-to-treat full analysis set (87 in the NBTXR3 group and 89 in the 
radiotherapy alone group). A pathological complete response was noted in 14 
(16%) of 87 patients in the NBTXR3 group and seven (8%) of 89 in the 
radiotherapy alone group (p=0·044). In both treatment groups, the most common 
grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event was postoperative wound complication 
(eight [9%] of 89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and eight [9%] of 90 in the 
radiotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events related to 
NBTXR3 administration were injection site pain (four [4%] of 89) and hypotension 
(four [4%]) and the most common grade 3-4 radiotherapy-related adverse event was 
radiation skin injury in both groups (five [6%] of 89 in the NBTXR3 group and 
four [4%] of 90 in the radiotherapy alone group). The most common 
treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse event related to NBTXR3 was hypotension 
(six [7%] of 89 patients). Serious adverse events were observed in 35 (39%) of 
89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and 27 (30%) of 90 patients in the radiotherapy 
alone group. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: This trial validates the mode of action of this new class of 
radioenhancer, which potentially opens a large field of clinical applications in 
soft-tissue sarcoma and possibly other cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine in 
patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD).
METHOD: Patients with TD who completed the 12 week, phase 3, placebo-controlled 
trials were eligible to enter this open-label, single-arm study. The open-label 
study consisted of a 6 week dose-escalation phase and a long-term maintenance 
phase (clinic visits at Weeks 4, 6 and 15, and every 13 weeks until Week 106). 
Patients began deutetrabenazine at 12 mg/day, titrating up to a dose that was 
tolerable and provided adequate dyskinesia control, based on investigator 
judgement, with a maximum allowed dose of 48 mg/day (36 mg/day for patients 
taking strong cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors). Safety measures included 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) and scales used to monitor parkinsonism, 
akathisia/restlessness, anxiety, depression, suicidality and 
somnolence/sedation. Efficacy endpoints included the change in Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score (items 1 to 7) from baseline and the 
proportion of patients rated as 'Much Improved' or 'Very Much Improved' on the 
Clinical Global Impression of Change.
RESULTS: A total of 343 patients enrolled in the extension study, and there were 
331 patient-years of exposure in this analysis. The exposure-adjusted incidence 
rates of AEs with long-term treatment were comparable to or lower than those 
observed in the phase 3 trials. The mean (SE) change in AIMS score was -4.9 
(0.4) at Week 54 (n = 146), - 6.3 (0.7) at Week 80 (n = 66) and -5.1 (2.0) at 
Week 106 (n = 8).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term treatment with deutetrabenazine was efficacious, 
safe, and well tolerated in patients with TD.

Genome-wide analysis of 67 ancient Near Eastern cattle, Bos taurus, remains 
reveals regional variation that has since been obscured by admixture in modern 
populations. Comparisons of genomes of early domestic cattle to their aurochs 
progenitors identify diverse origins with separate introgressions of wild stock. 
A later region-wide Bronze Age shift indicates rapid and widespread 
introgression of zebu, Bos indicus, from the Indus Valley. This process was 
likely stimulated at the onset of the current geological age, ~4.2 thousand 
years ago, by a widespread multicentury drought. In contrast to genome-wide 
admixture, mitochondrial DNA stasis supports that this introgression was 
male-driven, suggesting that selection of arid-adapted zebu bulls enhanced herd 
survival. This human-mediated migration of zebu-derived genetics has continued 
through millennia, altering tropical herding on each continent.

Plant perception of insect feeding involves integration of the multiple signals 
involved: wounding, oral secretions, and substrate borne feeding vibrations. 
Although plant responses to wounding and oral secretions have been studied, 
little is known about how signals from the rapidly transmitted vibrations caused 
by chewing insect feeding are integrated to produce effects on plant defenses. 
In this study, we examined whether 24 h of insect feeding vibrations caused 
changes in levels of phytohormones and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
produced by leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana when they were subjected to just 
feeding vibrations or feeding vibrations and wounding + methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 
compared to their respective controls of silent sham or wounding + MeJA. We 
showed that feeding vibrations alone caused a decrease in the concentrations of 
most phytohormones, compared to those found in control plants receiving no 
vibrations. When feeding vibrations were combined with wounding and application 
of MeJA, the results were more complex. For hormones whose levels were induced 
by wounding and MeJA (jasmonic acid, indole-3-butyric acid), the addition of 
feeding vibrations caused an even larger response. If the level of hormone was 
unchanged by wounding and MeJA compared with controls, then the addition of 
feeding vibrations had little effect. The levels of some VOCs were influenced by 
the treatments. Feeding vibrations alone caused an increase in β-ionone and 
decrease in methyl salicylate, and wounding + MeJA alone caused a decrease in 
benzaldehyde and methyl salicylate. When feeding vibrations were combined with 
wounding + MeJA, the effects on β-ionone and methyl salicylate were similar to 
those seen with feeding vibrations alone, and levels of benzaldehyde remained 
low as seen with wounding + MeJA alone. The widespread downregulation of plant 
hormones observed in this study is also seen in plant responses to cold, 
suggesting that membrane fluidity changes and/or downstream signaling may be 
common to both phenomena.

At present, there is no accurate and effective method for treating neoplastic 
pericardial effusion. This study analyzed the current literature on the 
treatment of neoplastic pericardial effusion to provide advice and guidance for 
clinical treatment. Surgical treatments include pericardial puncture, extension 
of catheter drainage, pericardial window, and surgical pericardiotomy. Each 
surgical procedure has a corresponding indication, and the best treatment is 
selected according to the patient's specific conditions. Systemic chemotherapy 
is effective in lymphoma and small cell lung cancer that are sensitive to 
chemotherapeutic drugs. Although pericardial injection of drugs is effective for 
pericardial tamponade and recurrent pericardial effusion, these methods can only 
temporarily relieve symptoms and cannot prolong the life of patients. In recent 
years, immunotherapy, especially adoptive immunotherapy, has achieved good 
results in the treatment of neoplastic pericardial effusion, thus providing 
a novel treatment option for neoplastic pericardial effusion.
