BACKGROUND: In Thailand, there has been no economic evaluation study of adjuvant 
chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer patients after resection.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the cost-utility of all chemotherapy 
regimens currently used in Thailand compared with the adjuvant 
5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) plus capecitabine as the first-line therapy 
for metastatic disease in patients with stage III colon cancer after resection.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to estimate the relevant lifetime 
costs and health outcomes of chemotherapy regimens based on a societal 
perspective using a Markov model.
RESULTS: The results suggested that the adjuvant 5-FU/LV plus capecitabine as 
the first-line therapy for metastatic disease would be the most cost-effective 
chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The adjuvant FOLFOX and FOLFIRI as the first-line treatment for 
metastatic disease would be cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of 299,365 Thai baht per QALY gained based on a 
societal perspective if both prices of FOLFOX and FOLFIRI were decreased by 40%.

Medical Sciences, North Little Rock, AR.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to apply a new methodology 
(population-level cost-effectiveness analysis) to determine the value of 
implementing an evidence-based practice in routine care.
DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data are from sequentially conducted studies: a 
randomized controlled trial and an implementation trial of collaborative care 
for depression. Both trials were conducted in the same practice setting and 
population (primary care patients prescribed antidepressants).
STUDY DESIGN: The study combined results from a randomized controlled trial and 
a pre-post-quasi-experimental implementation trial.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: The randomized controlled trial collected 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from survey and medication possession ratios 
(MPRs) from administrative data. The implementation trial collected MPRs and 
intervention costs from administrative data and implementation costs from 
survey.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the randomized controlled trial, MPRs were significantly 
correlated with QALYs (p = .03). In the implementation trial, patients at 
implementation sites had significantly higher MPRs (p = .01) than patients at 
control sites, and by extrapolation higher QALYs (0.00188). Total costs 
(implementation, intervention) were nonsignificantly higher ($63.76) at 
implementation sites. The incremental population-level cost-effectiveness ratio 
was $33,905.92/QALY (bootstrap interquartile range -$45,343.10/QALY to 
$99,260.90/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology was feasible to operationalize and gave reasonable 
estimates of implementation value.

The use of plant extracts could be a useful alternative to synthetic fungicides 
in the post harvest handling of fruits and vegetables. The aim of this study was 
to access the efficacy of extracts obtained from four plants (neem, Pongamia, 
custard apple leaf and marigold flowers) on the extension of shelf life of mango 
fruits cv. Dashehri under two storage conditions (Cool store and ambient 
condition). The fruits were treated with 2 concentrations of each plant extracts 
(10 % and 20 %) were placed in perforated linear low density poly ethylene bags 
and stored in storage conditions viz., cool storage and ambient condition, 
respectively. The treatment of neem leaf extract in combination with cool 
storage gave encouraging results. Up to the end of the storage study the 
treatment combination of 20 % neem leaf extract and cool store completely 
inhibited the pathogens, and no spoilage was observed. There was minimum 
physiological loss in weight (6.24 %), minimum girth reduction (0.62 %), maximum 
ascorbic acid content (29.96 mg/ 100 g of pulp), maximum acidity (0.19 %), 
minimum pH (5.28), maximum total soluble solids (20.96 %), maximum total sugars 
(12.50 %), reducing sugars (4.12 %) and non- reducing sugars (7.96 %) and best 
organoleptic score (7.93/10) in this interaction. The inhibitory effect of neem 
leaf extract was ascribed to the presence of active principle azadirachtin.

Iranian sour cherries (Prunus cerasus) were coated with fresh Aloe vera gel or 
treated with hot water (40 ± 2 °C) for 2 min and stored for 17 days at 4 ± 1 °C. 
The physicochemical characteristics of gel coated and hot water treated samples 
were compared with untreated fruit during the cold storage period. Untreated 
fruit showed increased respiration rate, rapid weight loss and colour change, 
accelerated aging and ripening. On the contrary, sour cherries, particularly 
those coated with gel significantly delayed the above mentioned parameters 
allowing a fruit storability extension. The sensory analysis in both treatments 
revealed beneficial effects in terms of delaying dehydration, maintenance of 
fruit visual aspect without any detrimental effect on taste, aroma or flavours. 
Consequently, Aloe vera gel coating and immersion in hot water maintained the 
properties during postharvest storage of sour cherries and could be introduced 
as two valuable, simple and non-contaminating treatments.

The slope and curvature of the survivorship function reflect the considerable 
amount of variance in length of life found in any human population. Part is due 
to the well-known variation in life expectancy between groups: large differences 
according to race, sex, socioeconomic status, or other covariates. But 
within-group variance is large even in narrowly defined groups, and changes 
substantially and inversely with the group average length of life. We show that 
variance in length of life is inversely related to the Gompertz slope of log 
mortality through age, and we reveal its relationship to variance in a 
multiplicative frailty index. Our findings bear a variety of implications for 
modeling and forecasting mortality. In particular, we examine how the assumption 
of proportional hazards fails to account adequately for differences in subgroup 
variance, and we discuss how several common forecasting models treat the 
variance along the temporal dimension.

Outcomes of total joint arthroplasty in HIV patients.

Falakassa J(1), Diaz A(1), Schneiderbauer M(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics Jackson Health System/University of Miami.

BACKGROUND: Advancement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapies has 
increased life expectancy. The need for joint replacement is expected to 
increase as this population develops degenerative changes from aging and 
avascular necrosis (AVN). Studies have shown a higher risk of peri-prosthetic 
joint infections (PJI) in HIV patients. However, these studies include a high 
percentage of hemophiliacs, which may be a confounding variable. With the advent 
of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and evolving HIV demographics, 
we hypothesize the rate of PJIs in HIV patients are comparable to the general 
population.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected 
data from our arthroplasty database. We identified 24 HIV patients that 
underwent 31 primary hip and one primary knee arthroplasty between July 1, 2000 
and September 30, 2012. Mean age was 50 years (range 31-74). Mean follow-up was 
14 months (range 1.5-60).
RESULTS: There were no PJIs in our HIV population. All HIV patients were 
non-hemophiliacs on HAART. Thirty-one total hip arthroplasties (THA) and one 
total knee arthroplasty were performed. Twenty-one HIV patients underwent THA 
for AVN. Eight patients had bilateral AVN. One patient needed revision for 
aseptic loosening. The mean CD4 count was 647 (194-1193). Mean viral load was 
undetectable in 19 patients and unavailable in five.
CONCLUSIONS: Our HIV population had a lower rate of PJI compared to infection 
rates in prior literature. Despite our limited patient population, our data 
suggests that well controlled HIV patients on HAART therapy with undetectable 
viral loads and CD4 >200 are at similar risk of PJI as the average population.

Sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens for chronic, genotype 1 hepatitis C virus 
infection in U.S. incarcerated populations: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Liu S, Watcha D, Holodniy M, Goldhaber-Fiebert JD.

BACKGROUND: Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high 
among incarcerated persons in the United States. New, short-duration, 
high-efficacy therapies may expand treatment eligibility in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir for HCV treatment in 
incarcerated populations.
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Treatment-naive men with chronic, genotype 1 HCV 
monoinfection.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: No treatment, 2-drug therapy (pegylated interferon and ribavirin), 
or 3-drug therapy with either boceprevir or sofosbuvir. For inmates with short 
remaining sentences (<1.5 years), only no treatment or sofosbuvir 3-drug therapy 
was feasible; for those with long sentences (≥1.5 years; mean, 10 years), all 
strategies were considered. After release, eligible persons could receive 
sofosbuvir 3-drug therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted costs (in 2013 U.S. dollars), discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The strategies yielded 13.12, 13.57, 14.43, and 
15.18 QALYs, respectively, for persons with long sentences. Sofosbuvir produced 
the largest absolute reductions in decompensated cirrhosis (16%) and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (9%), resulting in 2.1 additional QALYs at an added 
cost exceeding $54,000 compared with no treatment. For persons with short 
sentences, sofosbuvir cost $25,700 per QALY gained compared with no treatment; 
for those with long sentences, it dominated other treatments, costing $28,800 
per QALY gained compared with no treatment.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: High reinfection rates in prison attenuated 
cost-effectiveness for persons with long sentences.
LIMITATIONS: Data on sofosbuvir's long-term effectiveness and price are limited. 
The analysis did not consider women, Hispanic persons, or patients co-infected 
with HIV or hepatitis B virus.
CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir-based treatment is cost-effective for incarcerated 
persons, but affordability is an important consideration.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an optimal model to study stress responses for 
various reasons: i) budding yeast genome presents a high degree of homology with 
the human genome; ii) there are many proteins that show an elevated functional 
homology with specific human proteins; iii) it is a system whose genetic 
manipulation is reasonably easy and cheaper than other models; iv) the 
possibility of working with an haploid state facilitates the study of multiple 
processes; v) databases are the most complete of all the eukaryotic models. Due 
to the latest information derived from proteomic and genomic analyses, the 
genetic, biochemical and molecular information available relative to this 
biological system is extraordinarily big and complete. In this review, we 
present an overview of the mechanisms unravelling sensing and transducing 
oxidative stress. TOR, RAS/PKA, CWI, SNF1, and HOG are the main pathways 
involved both in the oxidative response and in the correct entry in stationary 
phase. In general, TOR and RAS/PKA dowregulation and SNF1 and CWI upregulation 
favour both a correct defence against oxidative damage and the entry in the 
quiescent state. All of these pathways have counterparts in humans. The actin 
cytoskeleton plays a dual function as sensor and target of oxidation, in tight 
connection with the former signalling cascades. In budding yeast, progression 
through stationary phase and quiescence constitute an accepted current model to 
study some of the mechanisms that determine life span. Aging is a process 
associated to oxidative stress and it is in tight relationship with bulk 
autophagy and mitophagy, both are mechanisms belonging to the oxidative defence 
and promoters of life extension when correctly regulated by, among other 
elements, the signalling cascades.

Center, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment (RRD) surgery on elderly patients in terms of visual acuity, 
vision-related quality of life and its cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Elderly patients over 70 years old, who were diagnosed and underwent 
RRD surgery at Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 
China, from January 1, 2009, through January 1, 2013. The participants received 
scleral buckling surgery and vitreous surgery with or without scleral buckling 
under retrobulbar anesthesia. We followed the patients for 1 year and collected 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), vision-related quality of life, and direct 
medical costs data. Utility values elicited by time-trade-off were analyzed to 
determine the quality of life. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in 
life expectancy were calculated and discounted at 3% annually. Costs per QALY 
gained were reported using the bootstrap method. Further analyses were made for 
two age groups, age 70-79 and age over 80 years. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to test stability of the results.
RESULTS: 98 patients were included in the study. The BCVA significantly improved 
by 0.53±0.44 (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR)) at the 
1-year postoperative time point (p<0.001). Utility values increased from 0.77 to 
0.84 (p<0.001), and an average of 0.4 QALYs were gained in the life expectancy. 
Costs per QALY gained from the RRD surgery were 33,186 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (5,276 
US dollars (USD))/QALY; 24,535 CNY (3,901 USD)/QALY for the age group of 70-79 
years and 71,240 CNY (11,326 USD)/QALY for the age group over 80 years.
CONCLUSIONS: RRD surgery improved the visual acuity and quality of life in the 
elderly patients over 70 years old. According to the World Health Organization's 
recommendation, at a threshold of willingness to pay of 115,062 CNY (18,293 
USD)/QALY, RRD surgery is cost effective in the elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence for the effectiveness of interventions 
for psychosis among ultra-high-risk (UHR) groups, health economic evaluations 
are lacking. This study aimed to determine the cost effectiveness and 
cost-utility of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) to prevent first-episode 
psychosis.
METHOD: The Dutch Early Detection and Intervention Evaluation study was a 
randomized controlled trial of 196 UHR patients with an 18-month follow-up. All 
participants were treated with routine care (RC) for non-psychotic disorders. 
The experimental group (n = 95) received add-on CBT to prevent first-episode 
psychosis. We report the intervention, medical and travel costs, as well as 
costs arising from loss of productivity. Treatment response was defined as 
psychosis-free survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the proportion of averted psychoses 
was significantly higher in the CBT condition (89.5% v. 76.2%). CBT showed a 
63.7% probability of being more cost effective, because it was less costly than 
RC by US$844 (£551) per prevented psychosis. In the cost-utility analysis, QALY 
health gains were slightly higher for CBT than for RC (0.60 v. 0.57) and the CBT 
intervention had a 52.3% probability of being the superior treatment because, 
for equal or better QALY gains, the costs of CBT were lower than those of RC.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on preventive CBT for UHR resulted in a significant reduction 
in the incidence of first psychosis. QALY gains show little difference between 
the two conditions. The CBT intervention proved to be cost saving.

Factors affecting the survival probability of becoming a centenarian for those 
aged 70, based on the human mortality database: income, health expenditure, 
telephone, and sanitation.

BACKGROUND: What are the factors that affect the survival probability of 
becoming a centenarian for those aged 70? Do the factors include income, health 
expenditure, the use of mobile telephones, or sanitation? The survival 
probability of becoming a centenarian (SPBC) is defined as an estimate of the 
production of centenarians by a population. The SPBC (70) is the survival 
probability of becoming a centenarian for those aged 70. This study estimates 
the associations between the SPBC (70), and the gross national income, health 
expenditure, telecommunications, and sanitation facilities in 32 countries.
METHODS: The socioeconomic indicators for this study were obtained from the 
database of the United Nations Development Programme. In addition, the data for 
the analysis of centenarians in 32 countries were obtained from the Human 
Mortality Database, which is maintained by the Department of Demography at the 
University of California, Berkeley, USA, and the Max Planck Institute for 
Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. Associations between socioeconomic 
indicators and SPBC (70) were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients 
and multiple regression models.
RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were found between the SPBC (70), and 
the socioeconomic factors of gross national income (GNI), public expenditure on 
health as a percentage of gross domestic product (PEHGDP), fixed and mobile 
telephone subscribers (FMTS) as the standard of living, and improved sanitation 
facilities (ISF). Overall, the SPBC (70) of female and male predictors were 
used, in order to form a model production of centenarians, with higher GNI and 
PEHGDP, as well as higher FMTS and ISF as the socioeconomic factors (R²= 0.422, 
P< 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The socioeconomic level in all 32 countries appears to have an 
important latent effect on the production of centenarians in both females and 
males. This study has identified the following four important aspects of 
socioeconomic indicators in the survival probability of becoming a centenarian 
for those aged 70: higher overall economic development level, public expenditure 
on health, mobile telephone subscribers as the standard of living, and the use 
of improved sanitation facilities for healthy aging. Thus, the socioeconomic 
level seems to affect an important on the survival probability of becoming a 
centenarian.

Average life expectancy is increasing in the western world resulting in a 
growing number of frail individuals with coronary heart disease, often 
associated with comorbidities. Decisions to proceed to invasive interventions in 
elderly frail patients is challenging because they may gain benefit, but are 
also at risk of procedure-related complications. Current risk scores designed to 
predict mortality in cardiac procedures are mainly based on clinical and 
angiographic factors, with limitations in the elderly because they are mainly 
derived from a middle-aged population, do not account for frailty and do not 
predict the impact of the procedure on quality of life which often matters more 
to elderly patients than mortality. Frailty assessment has emerged as a measure 
of biological age that correlates well with quality of life, hospital admissions 
and mortality. Potentially, the incorporation of frailty into current risk 
assessment models will cause a shift towards more appropriate care. The need for 
a more accurate method of risk stratification incorporating frailty, 
particularly for elderly patients is pressing. This article reviews the 
association between frailty and cardiovascular disease, the impact of frailty on 
outcomes of cardiac interventions and suggests ways in which frailty assessment 
could be incorporated into cardiology clinical practice.

The neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCL) is a group of neurodegenerative 
disorders characterized by epilepsy, visual failure, progressive mental and 
motor deterioration, myoclonus, dementia and reduced life expectancy. 
Classically, NCL-affected individuals have been classified into six categories, 
which have been mainly defined regarding the clinical onset of symptoms. 
However, some patients cannot be easily included in a specific group because of 
significant variation in the age of onset and disease progression. Molecular 
genetics has emerged in recent years as a useful tool for enhancing NCL subtype 
classification. Fourteen NCL genetic forms (CLN1 to CLN14) have been described 
to date. The variant late-infantile form of the disease has been linked to CLN5, 
CLN6, CLN7 (MFSD8) and CLN8 mutations. Despite advances in the diagnosis of 
neurodegenerative disorders mutations in these genes may cause similar 
phenotypes, which rends difficult accurate candidate gene selection for direct 
sequencing. Three siblings who were affected by variant late-infantile NCL are 
reported in the present study. We used whole-exome sequencing, direct sequencing 
and in silico approaches to identify the molecular basis of the disease. We 
identified the novel c.1219T>C (p.Trp407Arg) and c.1361T>C (p.Met454Thr) MFSD8 
pathogenic mutations. Our results highlighted next generation sequencing as a 
novel and powerful methodological approach for the rapid determination of the 
molecular diagnosis of NCL. They also provide information regarding the 
phenotypic and molecular spectrum of CLN7 disease.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate how continuous sedation until death (CSD), the 
reduction or removal of consciousness of an incurably ill individual until death 
to relieve refractory suffering, is practiced in nursing homes.
DESIGN: Nationwide cross-sectional retrospective survey.
SETTING: Nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium.
PARTICIPANTS: Palliative care nurses (N = 660) in all nursing homes in Flanders.
MEASUREMENTS: Nurse reports of their most recent patient treated with CSD.
RESULTS: The response rate was 65.5%, and 249 nurses reported a case of CSD 
(57.6%). Most individuals had cancer (33.6%) or dementia (32.8%); lacked 
competence (65.7%); and had severe pain (71.2%), fatigue (62.3%), loss of 
dignity (59%), anxiety (58.4%), and longing for death (58.4%). Intractable pain 
(70.7%) and physical exhaustion (63.9%) were the most decisive symptoms for 
initiating CSD. Life expectancy was generally limited to 1 week (64.9%), and 
88.4% had insufficient nutritional oral intake before the start of CSD. CSD was 
rarely combined with artificial nutrition or hydration. Benzodiazepines were 
most frequently used (84.8%). Overall, according to the reporting nurses, CSD 
provided adequate symptom relief and good quality of dying.
CONCLUSION: In nursing homes, CSD is typically used in residents with cancer or 
dementia and severe, intractable physical symptoms. Lack of competence prevents 
most residents from being involved in the decision-making process, which 
illustrates the importance of advance care planning in nursing homes in 
Flanders.

BACKGROUND: The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial aimed to determine the 
comparative effectiveness of surgical care versus nonoperative care by measuring 
longitudinal values: outcomes, satisfaction, and costs.
METHODS: This paper aims to summarize available evidence from the Spine Patient 
Outcomes Research Trial by addressing 2 important questions about outcomes and 
costs for 3 types of spine problem: (1) how do outcomes and costs of spine 
patients differ depending on whether they are treated surgically compared with 
nonoperative care? (2) What is the incremental cost per quality adjusted life 
year for surgical care over nonoperative care?
RESULTS: After 4 years of follow-up, patients with 3 spine conditions that may 
be treated surgically or nonoperatively have systematic differences in value 
endpoints. The average surgical patient enjoys better health outcomes and higher 
treatment satisfaction but incurs higher costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Spine care is preference sensitive and because outcomes, 
satisfaction, and costs vary over time and between patients, data on value can 
help patients make better-informed decisions and help payers know what their 
dollars are buying.

To understand the potential of application of tea polyphenols to the shelf life 
extension and quality maintenance of litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) fruit, the 
fruits were dipped into a solution of 1% tea phenols for 5 min before cold 
storage at 4 °C. Changes in browning index, contents of anthocyanins and 
phenolic compounds, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, 
O2.- production rate and H2O2 content, levels of relative leakage rate and lipid 
peroxidation, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging 
activity were measured after 0, 10, 20 and 30 days of cold storage. The results 
showed that application of tea polyphenols markedly delayed pericarp browning, 
alleviated the decreases in contents of total soluble solids (TSS) and ascorbic 
acid, and maintained relatively high levels of total phenolics and anthocyanins 
of litchi fruit after 30 days of cold storage. Meanwhile, the treatment reduced 
the increases in relative leakage rate and lipid peroxidation content, delayed 
the increases in both O2.- production rate and H2O2 contents, and increased SOD 
activity but reduced POD activity throughout this storage period. These data 
indicated that the delayed pericarp browning of litchi fruit by the treatment 
with tea polyphenols could be due to enhanced antioxidant capability, reduced 
accumulations of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, and improved 
membrane integrity.

Despite increasing life expectancy, the age of onset of natural menopause has 
not significantly changed in recent decades. Thus, women spend about one-third 
of their lives in an estrogen-deficient state if untreated. There is a need for 
appropriate treatment of acute symptoms and prevention of the sequelae of 
chronic estrogen deficiency. International guidelines call for the use of the 
lowest effective hormone dosage for vasomotor symptom relief, the major 
indication for menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). In 2011, an oral continuous 
combined ultra-low-dose MHT was approved in Switzerland. This publication was 
elaborated by eight national menopause specialists and intends to review the 
advantages and disadvantages of ultra-low-dose MHT after the first years of its 
general use in Switzerland. It concludes that, for many women, ultra-low-dose 
MHT may be sufficient to decrease vasomotor symptoms, but not necessarily to 
guarantee fracture prevention.

Left ventricle hypertrophy increases risk of cardiac failure and influences life 
expectancy. The authors demonstrated diagnostic reliability of genetic markers 
in evaluating left ventricle hypertrophy formation and their advantages over 
clinical signs, as outlines prognosis of diseases development on preclinical 
stage. Through genetic markers analysis with consideration of echo-cardiographic 
values of left ventricle myocardial weight, the authors determined genotypes 
associated with left ventricle hypertrophy development.

The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate (ERSPC) has updated 
their previous seminal report on prostate cancer mortality comparing screened 
men to controls. Now with 13 years follow-up, the rate ratio of prostate cancer 
mortality was 0.79 favoring the screened population. The authors concluded that 
there was a "substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to 
testing with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)" but they also stated that a 
"quantification of harms" needed to be addressed. The issue of harms was not 
addressed by the ERSPC (at least not in this report) and hence this additional 
statement most likely reflects the controversy currently surrounding the risks 
associated with over-diagnosis and treatment of indolent diseases inadvertently 
detected by a screening protocol. [1] In addition, the positive results from 
this trial conflict with those of the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian 
(PLCO) [2] study and require further elaboration.

BACKGROUND: Organized cervical screening has decreased the incidence of cervical 
cancer. However, screening strategies vary in different countries.
OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the economic aspects of 
different screening methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched databases and then data were abstracted from 
each study. We evaluated articles based on different types of screening tests as 
well as screening age and intervals, and using incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio via calculating quality adjusted life years (QALY), or life years gained 
(LYG) per cost. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
each study using GDP per capita. Furthermore, we compared national guidelines 
with recommendations of cost- effectiveness studies in different countries.
RESULTS: A total of 21 articles met our criteria, of which 19 studies showed 
that HPV DNA testing, 13 suggested an age of 30 years or more, and 10 papers 
concluded that at least a 5-year or longer interval were the most cost-effective 
strategies. In some countries, the national guidelines did not match the 
recommendations of the cost-effectiveness studies.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing, starting at age 30 years or older and repeated at 
5-year or longer intervals, is the most cost-effective strategy in any setting. 
Closer collaboration with health economists is required during guideline 
development.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination: comparing the general population 
with socially vulnerable individuals.

Korea E-mail : ecpark@yuhs.ac.

BACKGROUND: After the WHO recommended HPV vaccination of the general population 
in 2009, government support of HPV vaccination programs was increased in many 
countries. However, this policy was not implemented in Korea due to perceived 
low cost-effectiveness. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the 
cost-utility of HPV vaccination programs targeted to high risk populations as 
compared to vaccination programs for the general population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each study population was set to 100,000 people in a 
simulation study to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), then 
standard prevalence rates, cost, vaccination rates, vaccine efficacy, and the 
Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) were applied to the analysis. In addition, 
sensitivity analysis was performed by assuming discounted vaccination cost.
RESULTS: In the socially vulnerable population, QALYs gained through HPV 
vaccination were higher than that of the general population (General population: 
1,019, Socially vulnerable population: 5,582). The results of ICUR showed that 
the cost of HPV vaccination was higher for the general population than the 
socially vulnerable population. (General population: 52,279,255 KRW, Socially 
vulnerable population: 9,547,347 KRW). Compared with 24 million KRW/QALYs as the 
social threshold, vaccination of the general population was not cost-effective. 
In contrast, vaccination of the socially vulnerable population was strongly 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the importance and necessity of government 
support of HPV vaccination programs targeted to socially vulnerable populations 
because a targeted approach is much more cost-effective. The implementation of 
government support for such vaccination programs is a critical strategy for 
decreasing the burden of HPV infection in Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of joint protection and 
hand exercises for the management of hand OA is not well established. The 
primary aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) of 
these management options. In addition, given the absence of consensus regarding 
the conduct of economic evaluation alongside factorial trials, we compare 
different analytical methodologies.
METHODS: A trial-based economic evaluation to assess the cost-utility of joint 
protection only, hand exercises only and joint protection plus hand exercises 
compared with leaflet and advice was undertaken over a 12 month period from a UK 
National Health Service perspective. Patient-level mean costs and mean 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for each trial arm. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed. The base case analysis 
used a within-the-table analysis methodology. Two further methods were explored: 
the at-the-margins approach and a regression-based approach with or without an 
interaction term.
RESULTS: Mean costs (QALYs) were £58.46 (s.d. 0.662) for leaflet and advice, 
£92.12 (s.d. 0.659) for joint protection, £64.51 (s.d. 0.681) for hand exercises 
and £112.38 (s.d. 0.658) for joint protection plus hand exercises. In the base 
case, hand exercises were the cost-effective option, with an ICER of £318 per 
QALY gained. Hand exercises remained the most cost-effective management strategy 
when adopting alternative methodological approaches.
CONCLUSION: This is the first trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 
occupational therapy-supported approaches to self-management for hand OA. Our 
findings showed that hand exercises were the most cost-effective option.
