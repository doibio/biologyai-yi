not as good as those seen in adult cases. A definitive limb salvaging procedure 
in children that outperforms amputation or rotationplasty has not yet been 
established. Herein, we report a case of stage IV osteosarcoma in the femur of a 
7-year-old boy that was safely managed with intercalary resection preserving the 
distal femoral growth plate and epiphysis, followed by biological reconstruction 
using a frozen tumor-devitalized autograft. Good response to preoperative 
chemotherapy and the diaphyseal location of the tumor enabled us to perform a 
tumor resection that spared the growth plate and preserved the native knee joint 
structure. Plate fixation over the growth plate was terminated by removing the 
locking screws in the epiphysis after 44 months, which restored growth capacity 
to some extent. At 50 months postoperatively, no recurrence or progression of 
the disease was observed. The patient uses an extension shoe and reports having 
little discomfort in his daily life despite having a restricted range of motion 
and limb length discrepancy. In conclusion, limb salvage with biological 
reconstruction in skeletally immature patients can provide an acceptable 
functional outcome, including minimized limb length discrepancy, if critical 
damage to the growth plate and articular components can be avoided.

University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.

PURPOSE: To investigate the socio-economic disparity in global burden of near 
vision loss by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: The DALY numbers of country income groups by World Bank classification 
and the national age-standardized DALY rates caused by near vision loss were 
obtained from Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Human development index (HDI) 
was collected from the Human Development Report. The association between 
age-standardized DALY rates and HDI was analysed. Additionally, the 
concentration index (CI) and the relative index of inequality (RII) were 
employed to assess the trends of socio-economic disparity in the global burden 
of near vision loss from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: The global burden of near vision loss increased from 5.3 million DALYs 
in 1990 to 9.8 million DALYs in 2017, corresponding to an increase of 82.4%. The 
highest rate of increase for 1990-2017 occurred in low-income country group 
(97.7%). Age-standardized DALY rates were inversely correlated with HDI 
(Standardized β = -0.679, P < 0.001). Lower HDI countries displayed higher 
age-standardized DALY rates caused by near vision loss. From 1990 to 2017, CI 
declined from -0.233 to -0.209, and RII increased from 0.149 to 0.247.
CONCLUSION: The total global burden of near vision loss increased greatly in the 
past few decades, with low-income countries showing the highest growth. The 
age-standardized burden was higher in countries with lower socio-economic 
status. Although a declining trend of socio-economic inequalities was observed, 
the persistence of disparities still highlights the need to provide more eye 
care services for developing countries.

The invasive spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a major 
pest of soft-skinned fruits. Since its introduction into North America and 
Europe, significant progress has been made in understanding the volatile cues 
used by this fly during food, oviposition site, and mate finding. Despite this 
progress, commercially available lures are non-selective. Here, we tested two 
Hanseniaspora uvarum (Niehaus) yeast compounds (isoamyl acetate and isobutyl 
acetate) and a leaf compound β-cyclocitral alone and in combination with a blend 
of four fermentation compounds ('Fermentation lure': acetic acid, ethanol, 
methionol, and acetoin) to improve D. suzukii attraction and selectivity. In 
laboratory assays, males and females were attracted to all seven individual 
compounds, although in electrophysiological assays, their antennae exhibited a 
dose-dependent response to only four of these compounds. In two-choice cage 
studies, the Fermentation lure was more attractive to D. suzukii than water 
controls, whereas β-cyclocitral and the mixture of isoamyl acetate and isobutyl 
acetate were not attractive in this larger-cage study. Moreover, adding the 
two-component H. uvarum compound blend to the Fermentation lure reduced D. 
suzukii attraction to the Fermentation blend. When these experiments were 
repeated in blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, and cherry orchards across several 
states in the United States over 2 yr, similar outcomes were observed: 
β-cyclocitral or the mixture of the H. uvarum blend did not improve the 
attractiveness of the Fermentation lure or its selectivity. This study 
demonstrates that cues from different sources may interfere with each other and 
reduce D. suzukii attraction to otherwise attractive odor combinations.

The Haves, the Have-nots, and the Will-nots.

Mehlman MJ.

What if science enabled us to live an extended lifespan? Well, not us, but 
people in the future, and perhaps not everybody in the future, at least not at 
first. Should we allow and encourage science to develop this capability, or 
should we try to prevent or inhibit it? John Davis's book New Methuselahs: The 
Ethics of Life Extension is a thorough exploration of these questions. He 
presents the arguments for and against developing this capacity, and he 
considers three perspectives: those of individuals who will be able to extend 
their lives (the Haves), individuals who will not because they can't afford to 
(the Have-nots), and individuals who will not extend their lives because they 
are opposed to doing so (the Will-nots). Davis is a philosopher, and the bulk of 
this book is for the cognoscenti.

Swallowing problems, or dysphagia, are common as people age, and are associated 
with significant negative outcomes, including weight loss, pneumonia, 
dehydration, shortened life expectancy, reduced quality of life, and increased 
caregiver burden. In this article, we will discuss the complex process of 
swallowing in normal circumstances and with healthy aging, then review 
etiologies that contribute to dysphagia. We will discuss approaches to 
evaluating and treating dysphagia, providing relevant data where they are 
available. We highlight the desperate need for high-quality research to guide 
best practices in treating dysphagia in older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc

The increase in life expectancy of the world population is associated with a 
higher prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the 
most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting currently 43 million people 
over the world. To date, most of the pharmacological interventions in AD are 
intended for the alleviation of some of its symptoms, and there are no effective 
treatments to inhibit the progression of the disease. Translocator protein 
(TSPO) is present in contact points between the outer and the inner 
mitochondrial membranes and is involved in the control of steroidogenesis, 
inflammation and apoptosis. In the last decade, studies have shown that TSPO 
ligands present neuroprotective effects in different experimental models of AD, 
both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this review is to analyze the data 
provided by these studies and to discuss if TSPO could be a viable therapeutic 
target for the development of new treatments for AD.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved life expectancy of 
infected subjects, generating a new epidemiological setting of people aging 
withHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). People living with HIV (PLWH), having 
longer life expectancy, now face several age-related conditions as well as side 
effects of long-term exposure of ART. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common 
comorbidity in this population. CKD is a relentlessly progressive disease that 
may evolve toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and significantly affect 
quality of life and risk of death. Herein, we review current understanding of 
renal involvement in PLWH, mechanisms and risk factors for CKD as well as 
strategies for early recognition of renal dysfunction and best care of CKD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The phase 3 NEOCRTEC5010 trial demonstrated that 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) had significantly greater efficacy 
than surgery alone did, but at the same time, the addition of NCRT places an 
economic burden on patients. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of NCRT 
followed by surgery based on the NEOCRTEC5010 trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state Markov model (disease-free survival, 
relapse and death) based on data from the NEOCRTEC5010 trial was used to 
estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NCRT plus surgery 
versus surgery alone for ESCC. The model evaluates the outcomes from the 
perspective of Chinese society. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
the ICER in terms of 2019 US$ per QALY gained, were calculated. Model robustness 
was evaluated with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with surgery alone, NCRT plus surgery increased costs by 
$14933.57, while gaining 3.08 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $4848.56 per QALY. 
The ICER was far below the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold 
($26,157 per QALY). The duration of disease-free survival (DFS) for the group 
that received NCRT was the crucial factor in determining the ICER.
CONCLUSION: Compared with surgery alone, NCRT followed by surgery for locally 
advanced ESCC can be cost-effective because of significant clinical benefits.

Caffeine and related purine alkaloids are common ingredients of many stimulating 
drinks. Studies have shown that lower concentrations of caffeine have a 
protective role in aging-related disorders. However, the associated mode of 
action of caffeine and its related methylxanthines is still not clear. In this 
study, we demonstrated that caffeine and theophylline promote longevity in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan studies with the wild type, DAF-16 and SKN-1 
mutant strains indicated that the methylxanthines-mediated lifespan extension in 
C. elegans was independent of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1. All the tested 
methylxanthines could protect C. elegans against acute oxidative stress. At 
early stages of life, an increase of ROS (reactive oxygen species) induced the 
translocation of DAF-16 and SKN-1, resulting in upregulation of several 
antioxidant genes, for example, sod-3p::GFP, gst-4p::GFP, gcs-1p::GFP; and 
downregulation of hsp-16.2p::GFP. RT-PCR corroborates the upregulation of gst-4 
and skn-1 genes. The expression of DAF-16 decreased although its nuclear 
translocation was induced.

Aim: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of using rivaroxaban vs 
apixaban for the initial treatment plus extended prevention of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) in the UK. Extended prevention was assessed using a 10-mg 
rivaroxaban dose, as the 20-mg dose has already been evaluated. Methods: A 
Markov model compared the health outcomes and costs of treating VTE patient 
cohorts with either rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 
20 mg once daily for 6 months, then extended prevention with 10 mg once daily) 
or apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 1 week, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 
months, then extended prevention with 2.5 mg twice daily) over a lifetime 
horizon. The model included an initial acute treatment and prevention phase 
(0-6 months) and an extended prevention phase (6-18 months). Efficacy and safety 
data were derived from two network meta-analyses. Reference treatment 
comparators were derived from the EINSTEIN-Pooled study and EINSTEIN-CHOICE 
trial. Healthcare costs and utility data were derived from published literature. 
Results: The rivaroxaban regimen was associated with increased quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and slightly lower total costs compared with apixaban over a 
lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
demonstrated that rivaroxaban remained a cost-effective alternative to apixaban 
over a wide range of parameters. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates 
were below the £20,000 per QALY threshold in 74.1% of 2,000 model simulations. 
Scenario analyses further supported that rivaroxaban is a cost-effective 
alternative to apixaban. Limitations: Clinical and safety inputs were derived 
from network meta-analysis, which are subject to inherent limitations whereby 
small differences between study designs may severely impact efficacy and safety 
outcomes. Furthermore, these inputs were based on data from clinical trials, 
which may not reflect real-world data. Conclusions: Rivaroxaban was associated 
with a slightly lower total cost and increased QALYs compared with apixaban for 
VTE management in the UK over a lifetime horizon.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deprescribing may be particularly relevant in older 
people with limited life expectancy. In order to effectively carry out 
deprescribing in this population, it is important to understand the perspectives 
of the full spectrum of health care professionals (HCPs) involved in the 
management of these patients' medication. Thus, we aimed to explore different 
HCPs' perspectives on deprescribing in older patients with limited life 
expectancy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Six qualitative focus group interviews were 
conducted using a semistructured approach. The groups comprised HCPs from both 
primary and secondary care, including family physicians (FPs), geriatricians, 
clinical pharmacologists, clinical pharmacists, nurses, and health care 
assistants. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results 
were analyzed using systematic text condensation.
RESULTS: A total of 32 HCPs participated in the study (median age of 40.5 years; 
22% male). The analysis elicited three main themes related to HCPs' perspectives 
on deprescribing in older patients with limited life expectancy: (a) Approaching 
deprescribing, (b) Taking responsibility, and (c) Collaboration across 
professions. Within themes, subthemes were identified and analyzed.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results imply that different groups of HCPs 
consider deprescribing an essential aspect of providing good care for older 
people with limited life expectancy and find that all HCPs play a crucial role 
in the deprescribing process, with FPs having the primary responsibility. In 
order to facilitate deprescribing among this population, however, the 
collaboration between different HCPs should be improved.

Health holds an important position in maintaining economic development since it 
is both a prerequisite for and an outcome of economic development. This means 
that health contributes greatly to the attainment of sustainable development and 
health outcomes. The importance of health is demonstrated in the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) where three of the eight goals are aimed at improving 
health outcomes. Despite progress made by other middle-income countries in 
achieving health-related MDGs, South Africa is still worse off in respect of 
health outcomes and experiences a challenge in attaining positive outcomes for 
these goals. This study's main focus was to identify the association between 
public health expenditure and health outcomes in South Africa's nine provinces 
from 2002 to 2016. The study implemented fixed effects and a random effects 
panel data estimation technique to control for time effects and individual 
provincial heterogeneity. This was followed by employing the Hausman 
specification test to identify the fixed effects model as the appropriate 
estimator for the study. The study also employed the seemingly unrelated 
regression (SUR) model and the least squares dummy variable (LSDV) model to 
examine the impact of public health expenditure on each province separately. The 
findings elucidated that the relationship between public health expenditure and 
health outcomes in South Africa varied across provinces depending on provincial 
management and infrastructure availability.

The aging of a population structure is an inevitable path of demographic 
transition, as an inescapable result of decline in fertility rate and extension 
in life expectancy. Although demographic transition occurred earlier in Japan 
than in China, the two countries had similar patterns, both of which took a much 
shorter period of time than Western countries to complete demographic 
transition, as well as have been aging at a rapid speed that has rarely been 
seen in the world. Japan has the highest level of population aging in the world, 
and China has been experiencing a very fast pace of the population aging process 
and has the largest older population. Drawing upon data from World Population 
Prospects (2019), this paper compares changes in population aging in both China 
and Japan. Findings show that Japan's aging process is 30 years ahead of China, 
but China has been changing in a similar way as Japan. To be specific, both 
countries experienced four phases of the population aging process: accelerated 
development period, rapid development period, slow down period and high-level 
maintained period. In addition, both countries had a quick growing rate of 
population aging. It will take China 23 years and 10 years respectively for the 
aging rate increasing from 7% to 14% and then to 20%, while Japan took 24 and 11 
years respectively, which is much shorter than developed countries in the West. 
Furthermore, China has a faster pace than Japan in population aging in the next 
25 years. We found that from 2019-2044, China's aging rate, elderly dependency 
ratio, oldest-old coefficient and median age of population will increase 13.24 
percent points, 24.21 percent points, 8.33 percent points, and 8.47 years, while 
the four indicators of Japan will increase 8.38 percent points, 22.52 percent 
points, 8.29 percent points, and 6.20 years, respectively.

INTRODUCTION: Difficulties with neck mobility often interfere with patients' 
activities of daily living (ADL) after cervical posterior spine surgery. The 
range of motion of the cervical spine decreases markedly after multilevel 
cervical posterior decompression and fusion (PDF). However, details regarding 
the limitations of cervical spine function due to postoperative reduced neck 
mobility after multilevel PDF are as yet unclarified. The present study aimed to 
clarify the quality of life and its related factors after PDF, and the optimal 
fixed neck position in multilevel PDF that minimizes the limitations of ADL 
accompanying markedly reduced postoperative neck mobility.
METHODS: Limitations of ADL involving neck extension, rotation, and flexion were 
investigated in 32 consecutive patients who underwent C2-T1 PDF using the 
responses to the cervical spine function domain of the Japanese Orthopedic 
Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ). The EuroQol 
5 Dimension, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, and five domains of the 
JOACMEQ were also investigated. We investigated the risk factors regarding the 
fixed neck position in PDF for the impossibility to perform ADL involving each 
of three movements using cut-off values obtained from receiver-operating 
characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Postoperative comprehensive quality of life was significantly related 
to neurological improvements and to poor outcomes of cervical spine function 
after PDF. The significant risk factors for impossibility to perform ADL 
involving neck rotation were a C2-C7 lordotic angle ≥ 6° (P = 0.0057) or a 
proportion coefficient of C2-T1 tilt angle/C2-C7 lordotic angle ≤ 1.8 (P = 
0.0024). There were no significant risk factors for impossibility to perform ADL 
involving neck extension or flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal fixed neck position in C2-T1 PDF to reduce 
postoperative limitations of ADL involving neck mobility is a C2-C7 lordotic 
angle of less than 6°, or a C2-T1 tilt angle (°) of greater than 1.8 × the C2-C7 
lordotic angle (°).

A multi-environment genomic prediction model incorporating environmental 
covariates increased the prediction accuracy of wheat grain protein content. The 
advantage of the haplotype-based model was dependent upon the trait of interest. 
The inclusion of environment covariates (EC) in genomic prediction models has 
the potential to precisely model environmental effects and 
genotype-by-environment interactions. Together with EC, a haplotype-based 
genomic prediction approach, which is capable of accommodating the interaction 
between local epistasis and environment, may increase the prediction accuracy. 
The main objectives of our study were to evaluate the potential of EC to portray 
the relationship between environments and the relevance of local epistasis 
modelled by haplotype-based approaches in multi-environment prediction. The 
results showed that among five traits: grain yield (GY), plant height, protein 
content, screenings percentage (SP) and thousand kernel weight, protein content 
exhibited a 2.1% increase in prediction accuracy when EC was used to model the 
environmental relationship compared to treatment of the environment as a regular 
random effect without a variance-covariance structure. The approach used a 
Gaussian kernel to characterise the relationship among environments that 
displayed no advantage in contrast to the use of a genomic relationship matrix. 
The prediction accuracies of haplotype-based approaches for SP were consistently 
higher than the genotype-based model when the numbers of single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) in a haplotype were from three to ten. In contrast, for GY, 
haplotype-based models outperformed genotype-based methods when two to four SNPs 
were used to construct the haplotype.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involving the cervical spine can lead to various 
neurologic defects and impairment of proprioception is just one of them. The aim 
of this study was the assessment of cervical proprioception and its relation 
with radiographic, clinical, and functional characteristics of patients with RA. 
One hundred and six rheumatoid arthritis patients who diagnosed according to the 
2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 
criteria and age, gender, educational status matched one hundred and six healthy 
volunteers were enrolled in this study. Cervical joint position error test 
(CJPET) was applied to healthy volunteers and RA patients for cervical 
proprioception assessment. Fatigue, depression, balance, quality of life and 
balance scales were administered to all patients. Cervical radiography was used 
to assess cervical subluxations. Regression analysis was used for grading the 
factors which had relations with cervical proprioception. Mean age of patients 
and healthy volunteers was 51 ± 11.1 and 48.9 ± 9.2, respectively. Scores of 
CJPET were statistically significantly higher in RA group than healthy 
volunteers (p = 0.001). CJPET scores were negatively correlated with Berg 
balance scale findings in right rotation, left rotation, flexion and extension 
(rho = - 0.421,- 0.473,- 0.448,- 0.515). There was weak or not significant 
correlation between the scores of CJPET and fatigue, depression, and quality of 
life scales. Scores of CJPET in patients with atlantoaxial subluxations (AAS) 
were statistically significantly higher than those without AAS (p < 0.05). 
Regression analysis results showed that the AAS was related to impaired cervical 
proprioception on right and left rotations. There was no correlation between 
CJPET scores and functional parameters. Cervical proprioception impaired in RA 
patients. This impairment was related to the existence of AAS and balance 
problems.

Gut microbes are known as the body’s second gene pool. Symbiotic intestinal 
bacteria play a major role in maintaining balance in humans. Bad eating habits, 
antibiotic abuse, diseases, and a poor living environment have a negative effect 
on intestinal flora. Abnormal intestinal microbes are prone to cause a variety 
of diseases, affecting life expectancy and long-term quality of life, especially 
in older people. Several recent studies have found a close association between 
intestinal microorganisms and osteoporosis. The potential mechanism of 
intestinal flora affecting bone formation or destruction by mediating nitric 
oxide, the immune and endocrine systems, and other factors is briefly described 
in this review. All of these factors may be responsible for the intestinal flora 
that causes osteoporosis. Studying the relationship between intestinal flora and 
bone health not only provides new ideas for studying the role of intestinal 
microorganism in osteoporosis, but also provides a new therapeutic direction for 
clinically refractory osteoporosis. Study of the relationship between intestinal 
microbiota and osteoporosis is important for maintaining bone health and 
minimizing osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: The combination of sugar osmotic dehydration and microwave vacuum 
drying is an effective method for the dehydration of blackberries, the retention 
of their antioxidant properties, and the extension of their shelf life. Mass 
transfer during the osmotic dehydration of blackberries in sugar solution was 
investigated together with its influence on microwave vacuum drying 
characteristics, and the retention rate of anthocyanins in dried frozen 
blackberries.
RESULTS: The concentrations of the osmotic solutions that were tested contained 
40%, 50%, and 60% sugar, and the osmotic solution temperatures were 30 °C, 
40 °C, and 50 °C. The solution-to-blackberry mass ratio was 10:1 (w/w) and the 
process duration varied from 0 to 5 h. A two-parameter mathematical model was 
used to describe mass transfer in the osmotic dehydration of blackberry samples 
and estimate moisture loss and solid gain in the final equilibrium. The results 
showed that the dehydration rate and solid gain rate of the blackberries 
increased with an increase in osmotic concentration, osmotic time, and the 
temperature of the solution under certain experimental conditions. The effective 
diffusivity of moisture and solute were estimated using the analytical solution 
of Fick's second law of diffusion. The moisture and effective diffusivities of 
sugar in the above osmotic dehydration conditions were in the range of 
1.77 × 10-9 -2.10 × 10-9 and 1.36 × 10-9 -1.60 × 10-9 m2 .s-1 , respectively.
CONCLUSION: The pretreatment of sugar osmosis greatly reduced the microwave 
vacuum drying time in the latter part of the dehydration period and increased 
anthocyanin retention. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

INTRODUCTION: This review aimed to classify major patterns of cancer cure and 
discuss clinical implications. Patterns of cancer cure were identified, in terms 
of long-term survival and life expectancy, by means of two recently estimated 
indicators: cure fraction (CF) and time to cure (TTC).
METHODS: We considered population-based studies reporting results for some 
cancer types on CF, defined as the proportion of patients who will reach the 
same life expectancy of the general population, or/and TTC, the time span 
necessary to experience a negligible excess mortality. TTC is obtained using 
conditional relative survival, which indicates the probability of surviving an 
additional y number of years, given that patients already survived x number of 
years.
RESULTS: Four major patterns of cancer types emerged from published studies: (a) 
cancers with a CF > 60% and a TTC < 5 years (e.g., testicular, thyroid); (b) 
cancers with a CF between 20% and 50% and a TTC < 10 years (colon, rectum); (c) 
cancers showing a CF of approximately 50% and TTC > 10 years (breast, prostate 
and bladder); (d) cancers with a CF < 20% and uncertain TTC (lung or pancreas).
CONCLUSION: Clinical and social impact of "cancer cure" categorisation are 
discussed in details. Recognising a cancer patient as cured represents an 
opportunity to improve their quality of life.

The prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) increases not only because of longer life 
expectancy but also because of the modern lifestyle, in particular physical 
inactivity and diets low in fiber and rich in sugar and saturated fats, which 
promote chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity. Adverse alterations of the 
gut microbiota (GMB) composition, called microbial dysbiosis, may favor 
metabolic syndrome and inflammaging, two important components of OA onset and 
evolution. Considering the burden of OA and the need to define preventive and 
therapeutic interventions targeting the modifiable components of OA, an expert 
working group was convened by the European Society for Clinical and Economic 
Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) to 
review the potential contribution of GMB to OA. Such a contribution is supported 
by observational or dietary intervention studies in animal models of OA and in 
humans. In addition, several well-recognized risk factors of OA interact with 
GMB. Lastly, GMB is a critical determinant of drug metabolism and 
bioavailability and may influence the response to OA medications. Further 
research targeting GMB or its metabolites is needed to move the field of OA from 
symptomatic management to individualized interventions targeting its 
pathogenesis.

A fast and frugal generic tool can provide decision support to those making 
decisions about individual cases, particularly clinicians and clinical 
commissioners operating within the budget and time constraints of their 
practices. The multi-national Generic Rapid Evaluation Support Tool (GREST) is a 
standard preference-sensitive Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-based tool, but 
innovatory insofar as an equity criterion is introduced as one of six. Equity 
impact reflects the number of population QALYs lost or gained in moving from Old 
(current intervention) to New (contemplated intervention). In the exemplar UK 
implementation Claxton's NHS Willingness to Pay per QALY is the numeraire. Any 
weight from 0 to 100% may be assigned to the equity criterion but its presence 
affirms that it is persons-as-citizens who experience any opportunity harms or 
benefits arising from actions within the health service commons. A 
fully-operational but demonstration-only version is available on open access, as 
proof of concept and method.

[Relief of Obstruction in the Management of Pancreatic Cancer].

[Article in Korean]

Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity, 
and its incidence is increasing as the population is aging. On the other hand, 
significant improvement in the prognosis has not occurred. The absence of early 
diagnosis means that many patients are diagnosed only when they develop 
symptoms, such as jaundice, due to a biliary obstruction. The role of endoscopy 
in multidisciplinary care for patients with pancreatic cancer continues to 
evolve. Controversy remains regarding the best preoperative biliary drainage in 
patients with surgically resectable pancreatic head cancer. In general, patients 
undergoing a surgical resection usually do not require preoperative biliary 
drainage unless they have cholangitis or receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If 
biliary drainage is performed prior to surgery, the patient's condition and a 
multidisciplinary approach should be considered. With the increasing life 
expectancy of patients with pancreatic cancer, the need for more long-time 
biliary drainage or pre-operative biliary drainage is also increasing. Strong 
evidence of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a 
first-line and essential treatment for biliary decompression has been provided. 
On the other hand, the use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage as 
well as percutaneous biliary drainage has been also recommended. During ERCP, 
self-expandable metal stent could be recommended instead of a plastic stent for 
the purpose of long stent patency and minimizing stent-induced complications. In 
this review, several points of view regarding the relief of obstruction in 
patients with pancreatic cancer, and optimal techniques are being discussed.
