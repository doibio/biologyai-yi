chlamydia, epididymitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in each of the 
two scenarios among students tested positive and their partners. Health effects 
were measured as cases of PID prevented, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
gained. Cost estimates included program costs, chlamydia testing/treatment costs 
in the absence of school screening, and treatment costs for epididymitis, PID, 
and PID sequelae. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured 
as cost/QALY gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted on key 
parameter estimates and assumptions used.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, at a total program cost of $333,848 over 
5 years, the program prevented an estimated 1.9 cases of epididymitis and 17.3 
cases of PID, resulting in an ICER of $38,235/QALY gained (yearly ICER ranging 
from $27,417 to $50,945/QALY). Of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation runs, the yearly 
ICER remained ≤$50,000/QALY in 64%-98% of the simulation runs.
CONCLUSIONS: We found favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for Michigan's 
school-wide STD screening program in Detroit. School-based STD screening 
programs of this type warrant careful considerations by policy makers and 
program planners.

Hepatic nerves have a complex role in synchronizing liver metabolism. Here, we 
used three-dimensional (3D) immunoimaging to explore the integrity of the 
hepatic nervous system in experimental and human nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD). We demonstrate parallel signs of mild degeneration and axonal 
sprouting of sympathetic innervations in early stages of experimental NAFLD and 
a collapse of sympathetic arborization in steatohepatitis. Human fatty livers 
display a similar pattern of sympathetic nerve degeneration, correlating with 
the severity of NAFLD pathology. We show that chronic sympathetic 
hyperexcitation is a key factor in the axonal degeneration, here genetically 
phenocopied in mice deficient of the Rac-1 activator Vav3. In experimental 
steatohepatitis, 3D imaging reveals a severe portal vein contraction, spatially 
correlated with the extension of the remaining nerves around the portal vein, 
enlightening a potential intrahepatic neuronal mechanism of portal hypertension. 
These fundamental alterations in liver innervation and vasculature uncover 
previously unidentified neuronal components in NAFLD pathomechanisms.

Stress is defined as a state of threatened homeodynamic balance by a wide range 
of intrinsic or extrinsic, real or perceived challenges or stimuli, defined as 
stressors. To preserve this optimal homeodynamic state within a physiologic 
range, organisms have developed a highly sophisticated system, the stress 
system, which serves self-regulation and adaptability of the organism by energy 
redirection according to the current needs. Repeated, ephemeral, and motivating 
stress states lead to adaptive responses and response habituations, being fairly 
beneficial; in contrast, inadequate, aversive, excessive, or prolonged stress 
may surpass the regulatory capacity and adjustive resources of the organism and 
produce maladaptive responses and a chronically altered homeodynamic state 
associated with compromised mental and physical health and life expectancy. 
Neuroendocrine responses to stress depend on developmental timing, duration, 
time of day and nature of stressors leading to a vulnerable phenotype with 
disrupted stress reactivity (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivation of the stress 
system), impaired glucocorticoid signaling, and accumulated cacostatic load with 
cumulatively elevated long-term risk of mental and physical morbidity. This 
article offers a brief overview on the organization and physiology of the human 
stress system and its (re)activity, refreshes the plethora of somatic effects of 
acute and chronic stress and discusses a conceptual model of acute and chronic 
stress pathophysiology as a continuum in chronic disease development.

BACKGROUND: We previously showed that cocoa, a rich source of polyphenols 
improved the age-associated health and extended the lifespan in C. elegans when 
supplemented starting from L1 stage.
AIM: In this study, we aimed to find out the effects of timing of cocoa exposure 
on longevity improving effects and the mechanisms and pathways involved in 
lifespan extension in C. elegans.
METHODS: The standard E. coli OP50 diet of wild type C. elegans was supplemented 
with cocoa powder starting from different larval stages (L1, L2, L3, and L4) 
till the death, from L1 to adult day 1 and from adult day 1 till the death. For 
mechanistic studies, different mutant strains of C. elegans were supplemented 
with cocoa starting from L1 stage till the death. Survival curves were plotted, 
and mean lifespan was reported.
RESULTS: Cocoa exposure starting from L1 stage till the death and till adult day 
1 significantly extended the lifespan of worms. However, cocoa supplementation 
at other larval stages as well as at adulthood could not extend the lifespan, 
instead the lifespan was significantly reduced. Cocoa could not extend the 
lifespan of daf-16, daf-2, sir-2.1, and clk-1 mutants.
CONCLUSION: Early-start supplementation is essential for cocoa-mediated lifespan 
extension which is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and 
mitochondrial respiration.

Background: Child malnutrition is not only common in developing countries but 
also an important issue faced by developed countries. This study aimed to 
explore the influence and degree of childhood starvation on the health of the 
elderly, which provides a reference for formulating health-related policies 
under the concept of full lifecycle health. Methods: Based on the Chinese 
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2008, 2011, and 2014, this 
study took a total of 13,185 elderly people aged 65-99 years as the target 
population. By IMaCH software, with gender and income level as the control 
variables, the average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of the 
elderly were measured. The x2test was used to explore the differences in the 
socioeconomic status of elderly people with or without starvation in childhood. 
Statistical differences between average life expectancy and healthy life 
expectancy were analyzed by rank tests. Results: (1) The results showed that 
there was a statistically significant difference in age, gender, residency, 
education level, and income level between the groups with or without starvation 
(P < 0.05). (2) Transition probabilities in health-disability, health-death, and 
disability-death all showed an upward trend with age (P < 0.05), where the 
elderly who experienced starvation in childhood were higher than those without 
such an experience (P < 0.05). However, the probability of disability-health 
recovery showed a downward trend with age (P < 0.05), in which the elderly who 
experienced starvation in childhood were lower than those without starvation (P 
< 0.05). (3) For the elderly who experienced starvation in childhood, the health 
indicators of the average life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and healthy 
life expectancy proportion accounted for the remaining life were lower than 
those of the elderly without childhood starvation (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The 
average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of the elderly with 
childhood starvation are lower than those without childhood starvation. It shows 
that the negative impact of childhood starvation on health through the life 
course till old age has a persistent negative cumulative effect on the quantity 
and quality of life. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the 
nutritional status of children in poor families from the perspective of social 
policymaking.

The global burden of children and young people (CYP) with bronchiectasis is 
being recognised increasingly. They experience a poor quality of life and 
recurrent respiratory exacerbations requiring additional treatment, including 
hospitalisation. However, there are no published data on patient-driven clinical 
needs and/or research priorities for paediatric bronchiectasis. 
Parent/patient-driven views are required to understand the clinical needs and 
research priorities to inform changes that benefit CYP with bronchiectasis and 
reduce their disease burden. The European Lung Foundation and the European 
Respiratory Society Task Force for paediatric bronchiectasis created an 
international roadmap of clinical and research priorities to guide, and as an 
extension of, the clinical practice guideline. This roadmap was based on two 
global web-based surveys. The first survey (10 languages) was completed by 225 
respondents (parents of CYP with bronchiectasis and adults with bronchiectasis 
diagnosed in childhood) from 21 countries. The parent/patient survey encompassed 
both clinical and research priorities. The second survey, completed by 258 
health practitioners from 54 countries, was limited to research priorities. The 
two highest clinical needs expressed by parents/patients were: having an action 
management plan for flare-ups/exacerbations and access to physiotherapists. The 
two highest health practitioners' research priorities related to eradication of 
airway pathogens and optimal airway clearance techniques. Based on both surveys, 
the top 10 research priorities were derived, and unanimous consensus statements 
were formulated from these priorities. This document addresses 
parents'/patients' clinical and research priorities from both the 
parents'/patients' and clinicians' perspectives and will help guide research and 
clinical efforts to improve the lives of people with bronchiectasis.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the skin. Both genetic and 
environmental factors play a pathogenic role in psoriasis and contribute to the 
severity of the disease. Psoriasis, in fact, has been associated with different 
comorbidities such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, gastrointestinal or kidney 
diseases, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD). 
Indeed, life expectancy in severe psoriasis is reduced by up to 5 years due to 
CVD and CeVD. Moreover, patients with severe psoriasis have a higher prevalence 
of traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including dyslipidemia, 
diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. Further, systemic inflammation is 
associated with oxidative stress increase and induces endothelial damage and 
atherosclerosis progression. Different miRNA have been already described in 
psoriasis, both in the skin tissues and in the blood flow, to play a role in the 
progression of disease. In this review, we will summarize and discuss the most 
important miRNAs that play a role in psoriasis and are also linked to CVD.

Surgical Treatment Strategies for Laryngeal Chondrosarcomas: A Single 
Institution Investigation.

Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

and Neck Surgery, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Laryngeal chondrosarcomas are rare malignancies with a 
spectrum of presentations due to varying size, local extension, and biological 
behavior. Moreover, these neoplasms have differing effects on respiration, 
phonation, and deglutition. Consequently, it is valuable to assess endoscopic 
and transcervical treatment strategies.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: A retrospective review was done from 2001 to 2020; 25 patients were 
identified with laryngeal chondrosarcomas. Their tumor pathology and treatment 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: All 25 chondrosarcomas were in the posterior cricoid and arose in 
proximity to at least one cricoarytenoid joint: 23 of 25 grade I-II (low-mid), 
one of 25 grade II-III (mid-high), and one of 25 grade III (high). Some tumor 
was left in 23 of 25 to preserve cricoarytenoid-joint function. There were no 
known disease-specific deaths (~8-year median follow-up). Final surgical 
treatment in 24 of 25 was: 13 of 25 transcervical partial laryngectomy, 7 of 25 
transoral-endoscopic removal, 4 of 25 total laryngectomy, and 1 of 25 
observation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, unresected intercurrent disease with laryngeal 
chondrosarcomas was not life-threatening. Therefore, disease was typically left 
in the posterior cricoid region to preserve mobility of at least one 
cricoarytenoid joint. This philosophy employed an ultra-function-sparing 
conservation approach that preserved and/or restored optimal voice, airway 
patency and swallowing.

Post-stroke cognitive deficits and dementia Abstract. Prediction of stroke 
outcome remains challenging due to a large inter-individual variability. For a 
long time, research on stroke outcome has been mainly confined to post-stroke 
motor deficits, whereas post-stroke cognitive decline has been less investigated 
though being an often reason for dependency and disability. Post-stroke 
cognitive impairment demonstrate high inter-individual variability, which is 
expected to increase further due to the increasing life expectancy and number of 
patients with pre-stroke brain pathology and cognitive deficits. There exist 
different types and patterns of post-stroke cognitive impairment: i) the 
deficits in one or several cognitive domains meaning the variability in 
neuropsychological profiles; ii) the decline might vary from mild to manifested 
dementia comprising a wide spectrum in severity; iii) with occurrence 
immediately after stroke or with delayed manifestation several months later 
without obvious reasons. Patients at risk for post-stroke cognitive impairment 
cannot be reliably identified. Many factors have been shown to worsen 
post-stroke cognitive outcome, but their effects have been only investigated in 
isolation by ignoring their potential interactions. An overall model 
sufficiently predicting post-stroke cognitive outcome was therefore missing 
until now. We recently suggested that the concepts of brain reserve and 
cognitive reserve, which are established for neurodegeneration, may represent a 
valuable theoretical framework to predict stroke-induced cognitive decline and 
disability. Cognitive stroke outcome can be defined as a result of an 
interaction between brain reserve (e. g. brain volume), cognitive reserve (e. g. 
level of education, cognitive-stimulation leisure activities) and lesion load. 
Our recent findings supported this hypothesis also for functional stroke 
outcome. By representing a valuable model comprehensively incorporating an 
individual's characteristics, the concepts of brain and cognitive reserve might 
help in screening of risk patients, establishment of individualized therapeutic 
approaches, and enable knowledge transfer.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die Vorhersage des Schlaganfall-Outcome bleibt 
aufgrund einer hohen interindividuellen Variabilität eine Herausforderung. Die 
steigende Lebenserwartung und die Zunahme der Anzahl von chronisch kranken 
Patienten werden die Variabilität im Schlaganfall-Outcome weiter erhöhen. Die 
Bedeutung von durch den Schlaganfall hervorgerufenen kognitiven Defiziten sollte 
in dieser Hinsicht nicht unterschätzt werden. Sie sind relevant für die spätere 
Alltagsselbstständigkeit aber auch unmittelbar für die somatische 
Rehabilitation. Die kognitive Störung nach Schlaganfall kann i) in einer oder 
mehreren kognitiven Domänen auftreten und damit unterschiedlichste Profile 
zeigen; ii) in der Ausprägung stark variieren – von leichter kognitiver Störung 
bis hin zu klinisch manifester Demenz; iii) sich sofort nach dem Ereignis oder 
um einige Monate verzögert manifestieren. Viele demographische, klinische 
Faktoren oder Schlaganfallfaktoren sind als Prädiktoren für relevante kognitive 
Verschlechterung nach Schlaganfall bekannt. Bisher wurden diese Risikofaktoren 
aber unabhängig voneinander untersucht. Ein umfassendes Modell, welches 
einheitlich alle diese Faktoren zusammen berücksichtigte, fehlte bis jetzt. Wir 
schlagen vor, dass die Konzepte für Hirnreserve und kognitive Reserve, die 
bereits für die Erfassung der inter-individuellen Variabilität bei 
neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen etabliert sind, auch für eine Vorhersage von 
kognitiven Defiziten nach Schlaganfall hilfreich sein können. Dabei lässt sich 
der Schweregrad der kognitiven Störung als Interaktion zwischen Hirnreserve 
(z. B. Hirnvolumen), kognitiver Reserve (z. B. Ausbildungsniveau) und 
Schlaganfallfaktoren (z. B. Läsionsgrösse, Anatomie) verstehen. Die ersten 
Studien konnten diese Hypothese bestätigen. Zukünftig dürfte die 
Berücksichtigung dieser Faktoren eine wesentlich präzisere Vorhersage der 
kognitiven Störung nach Schlaganfall erlauben. Für die Klinik bietet dies dann 
die Möglichkeit, im Rahmen einer individualisierten Rehabilitation gefährdete 
Patienten frühzeitig zu erkennen und diesen ggf. zusätzliche Interventionen zur 
Prävention einer Demenz nach Schlaganfall zukommen zu lassen.

Ulotaront (SEP-363856) is a trace amine-associated receptor 1 agonist with 
5-HT1A agonist activity in phase III development for the treatment of 
schizophrenia. The efficacy of ulotaront is not mediated by blockade of D2 or 
5-HT2A receptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPKs) of ulotaront in adult subjects using pooled data from 
seven phase I studies, one phase II acute study, and one 6-month extension 
study. Single and multiple (up to 7 days) oral doses (5-150 mg/day) were studied 
in both healthy adult subjects (with intensive serial plasma sampling) and adult 
patients with schizophrenia (some with intensive and some with sparse plasma 
sampling). Ulotaront was well-absorbed and exhibited dose-proportionality in 
doses ranging from 10 to 100 mg, in mean maximum concentration, area under the 
concentration-time curve, and minimum concentration. Moderate interindividual 
variability was observed in concentration-time profiles. The estimated median 
time to maximal concentration was 2.8 h and the median effective half-life was 
7 h, corresponding to an exposure accumulation ratio of 1.10 at steady-state 
with daily dosing. There was no indication of time-dependent changes in PKs 
after up to 12 weeks of daily dose administration. No clinically meaningful 
effects on ulotaront PK parameters were observed based on race, age, sex, 
formulation (capsule or tablet), or clinical status (healthy volunteer vs. 
patient with schizophrenia); body weight was the only meaningful covariate.

For the shelf life extension of fruits, we envisioned a novel antimicrobial 
approach that is based on the production of a thin layer of hydrogen peroxide at 
the surface of food by utilizing the bioactivity of glucose oxidase (GOx). The 
enzyme, purified from Aspergillus Niger, was immobilized on zinc oxide 
nanoparticles and then suspended in a buffer to prepare a spraying solution of 
GOx/ZnONPs. Post-immobilization analyses indicated that immobilized enzyme 
showed higher activity as compared to the free enzyme. The GOx/ZnONPs spray was 
applied for postharvest treatment of peach. The control and treatment groups 
were stored at ambient conditions for fifteen days and standard quality 
parameters were analyzed. In contrast to the control group, the GOx/ZnONPs spray 
treatment was remarkably effective in maintaining the physiological appearance 
of fruits even more than 12 days and showed a significant reduction in the 
decrease of weight, firmness, TSS, and DPPH free radical scavenging activity of 
fruits. Thus GOx/ZnONPs is an excellent platform to extend the postharvest shelf 
life of peach.

BACKGROUND: A previously performed phase III trial on 112 subjects investigating 
prophylactic nimodipine treatment in vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery showed 
no clear beneficial effects on preservation of facial and cochlear nerve 
functions, though it should be considered that protection of facial nerve 
function was the primary outcome. However, the risk for postoperative hearing 
loss was halved in the nimodipine group compared to the control group (OR 0.49; 
95% CI 0.18-1.30; p = 0.15). Accordingly, this phase III extension trial 
investigates the efficacy and safety of prophylactic nimodipine for hearing 
preservation in VS surgery.
METHODS: This is a randomized, multi-center, two-armed, open-label phase III 
trial with blinded expert review and two-stage with interim analysis. Three 
hundred thirty-six adults with the indication for microsurgical removal of VS 
(Koos I-IV) and serviceable preoperative hearing (Gardner-Robertson scale (GR) 
1-3) are assigned to either the therapy (intravenous nimodipine 1-2 mg/h from 
the day before surgery until the fifth postoperative day and standard of care) 
or the control group (surgery only and standard of care). The primary endpoint 
of the trial is postoperative cochlear nerve function measured before discharge 
according to GR 1-3 versus GR 4-5 (binary). Hearing function will be determined 
by pre- and postoperative audiometry with speech discrimination, which will be 
evaluated by a blinded expert reviewer. Furthermore, patient-reported outcomes 
using standardized questionnaires will be analyzed.
DISCUSSION: Prophylactic parenteral nimodipine treatment may have a positive 
effect on hearing preservation in VS surgery and would improve patient's quality 
of life. Further secondary analyses are planned. Except for dose-depending 
hypotension, nimodipine is known as a safe drug. In the future, prophylactic 
nimodipine treatment may be recommended as a routine medication in VS surgery. 
VS can be considered as an ideal model for clinical evaluation of 
neuroprotection, since hearing outcome can be classified by well-recognized 
criteria. The beneficial effect of nimodipine may be transferable to other 
surgical procedures with nerves at risk and may have impact on basic research.

PURPOSE: With improvements in life expectancy, adolescents and young adults 
(AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) increasingly face sexual and reproductive 
health (SRH) concerns. As subspecialists often serve as primary care providers 
for those with chronic disease, this study examines pediatric SCD providers' 
practices and attitudes related to SRH of AYA women with SCD.
METHODS: We developed an adapted survey to identify SCD provider attitudes and 
practices in addressing menses, sexual activity, contraception, and pregnancy 
for their female patients. We electronically distributed this survey to the 
American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology SCD interest group. We used 
descriptive statistics to analyze results.
RESULTS: A total of 78 pediatric SCD providers completed the survey. A majority 
(95%) rated SRH discussions as moderately important or higher, with 89% agreeing 
this care should be standardized. Most respondents reported discussing SRH, such 
as menses (78%), teratogenic medications (61%), and contraception (90%), with 
their female patients with SCD at least annually. Although most refer AYAs with 
SCD for birth control (83%), 39% endorsed a preferred method, with 33% of these 
favoring levonorgestrel intrauterine devices in this population and 40% 
injectable contraception. Approximately half of respondents (57%) reported that 
the use of combined hormonal contraceptives was unacceptable despite published 
guidelines that support potential benefits outweighing theoretical risk in AYAs 
with SCD.
CONCLUSIONS: The range of SRH conversations and contraceptive recommendations 
for AYAs from pediatric SCD providers is broad. SCD providers and AYAs with SCD 
would benefit from improved evidence and educational resources related to 
contraception as well as coordinated SRH counseling.

The use of surface electromyography (sEMG) is rapidly spreading, from robotic 
prostheses and muscle computer interfaces to rehabilitation devices controlled 
by residual muscular activities. In this context, sEMG-based gesture recognition 
plays an enabling role in controlling prosthetics and devices in real-life 
settings. Our work aimed at developing a low-cost, print-and-play platform to 
acquire and analyse sEMG signals that can be arranged in a fully customized way, 
depending on the application and the users' needs. We produced 8-channel sEMG 
matrices to measure the muscular activity of the forearm using innovative 
nanoparticle-based inks to print the sensors embedded into each matrix using a 
commercial inkjet printer. Then, we acquired the multi-channel sEMG data from 12 
participants while repeatedly performing twelve standard finger movements (six 
extensions and six flexions). Our results showed that inkjet printing-based sEMG 
signals ensured significant similarity values across repetitions in every 
participant, a large enough difference between movements (dissimilarity index 
above 0.2), and an overall classification accuracy of 93-95% for flexion and 
extension, respectively.

Capsicums lose water very rapidly after harvest and the moisture loss causes 
severe shriveling making them unmarketable within 2-3 days. The moisture loss 
occurs even under low temperature conditions, though at lesser rates. Bell 
peppers packed in corrugated fiber board boxes (CFB) tend to lose moisture 
continuously as these boxes are permeable to both water vapour and respiratory 
gases even if they are non-ventilated. To reduce the moisture loss and maintain 
freshness, yellow colour capsicum (cv. Bachata) were packed in CFB boxes and 
over wrapped with different semi-permeable films using shrink wrapping 
technology. This box shrink wrapping significantly lowered the weight loss and 
maintained firmness of capsicum at ambient (25.7-33.2 °C and 25-63% RH) and low 
temperature (8 °C ± 0.5 and 80 ± 5% RH) conditions. Yellow colour capsicums 
packed in this way could be stored for 11 days at ambient temperature with a 
weight loss of < 6% as compared to about 20% weight loss in non-wrapped fruits. 
The storage life could be extended to 5 weeks by storing these shrink wrapped 
boxes at 8 °C without any shriveling and with a weight loss of < 5%. In addition 
to maintaining high humidity, the lower O2 and higher CO2 levels maintained 
surrounding the produce in the wrapped boxes helped to avoid shriveling and to 
retain the quality in terms of surface colour, firmness and other quality 
traits. The absorption of excessive relative humidity by CFB itself in the over 
wrapped boxes helped in avoiding condensation of water droplets. This in turn 
avoided the development of fungal growth and thus the risk of fruit decay.

INTRODUCTION: The US Asian American (AA) population is projected to double by 
2050, reaching ~43 million, and currently resides primarily in urban areas. 
Despite this, the geographic distribution of AA subgroup populations in US 
cities is not well-characterized, and social determinants of health (SDH) and 
health measures in places with significant AA/AA subgroup populations have not 
been described. Our research aimed to: 1) map the geographic distribution of AAs 
and AA subgroups at the city- and neighborhood- (census tract) level in 500 
large US cities (population ≥66,000); 2) characterize SDH and health outcomes in 
places with significant AA or AA subgroup populations; and 3) compare SDH and 
health outcomes in places with significant AA or AA subgroup populations to SDH 
and health outcomes in places with significant non-Hispanic White (NHW) 
populations.
METHODS: Maps were generated using 2019 Census 5-year estimates. SDH and health 
outcome data were obtained from the City Health Dashboard, a free online data 
platform providing more than 35 measures of health and health drivers at the 
city and neighborhood level. T-tests compared SDH (unemployment, high-school 
completion, childhood poverty, income inequality, racial/ethnic segregation, 
racial/ethnic diversity, percent uninsured) and health outcomes (obesity, 
frequent mental distress, cardiovascular disease mortality, life expectancy) in 
cities/neighborhoods with significant AA/AA subgroup populations to SDH and 
health outcomes in cities/neighborhoods with significant NHW populations 
(significant was defined as top population proportion quintile). We analyzed AA 
subgroups including Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and 
Other AA.
RESULTS: The count and proportion of AA/AA subgroup populations varied 
substantially across and within cities. When comparing cities with significant 
AA/AA subgroup populations vs NHW populations, there were few meaningful 
differences in SDH and health outcomes. However, when comparing neighborhoods 
within cities, areas with significant AA/AA subgroup vs NHW populations had less 
favorable SDH and health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: When comparing places with significant AA vs NHW populations, 
city-level data obscured substantial variation in neighborhood-level SDH and 
health outcome measures. Our findings emphasize the dual importance of granular 
spatial and AA subgroup data in assessing the influence of SDH in AA 
populations.

Moderate to severe pain occurs in many cancer patients during their clinical 
course and may stem from the primary pathology, metastasis, or as treatment side 
effects. Uncontrolled pain using conservative medical therapy can often lead to 
patient distress, loss of productivity, shorter life expectancy, longer hospital 
stays, and increase in healthcare utilization. Various publications shed light 
on strategies for conservative medical management for cancer pain and a few 
international publications have reviewed limited interventional data. Our 
multi-institutional working group was assembled to review and highlight the body 
of evidence that exists for opioid utilization for cancer pain, adjunct 
medication such as ketamine and methadone and interventional therapies. We 
discuss neurolysis via injections, neuromodulation including targeted drug 
delivery and spinal cord stimulation, vertebral tumor ablation and augmentation, 
radiotherapy and surgical techniques. In the United States, there is a 
significant variance in the interventional treatment of cancer pain based on 
fellowship training. As a first of its kind, this best practices and 
interventional guideline will offer evidenced-based recommendations for reducing 
pain and suffering associated with malignancy.
