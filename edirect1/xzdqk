life in today's societies. As such, the study of factors affecting life 
expectancy is a key issue for policymakers. This study aims to investigate the 
impact of energy consumption, the democratic process, and government service 
delivery on life expectancy in 100 countries during 2000-2018, using panel 
quantile regression. The impact of these factors on life expectancy has been 
estimated in quantiles of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 
0.95. Also, the impact of GDP, CO2 emission, and Gini coefficient variables has 
been explored as controlling variables on life expectancy. The results show that 
the impact of CO2 emissions and the democratic process on life expectancy is 
negative in all quantiles, and the impact of GDP is negative in all quantiles 
except 0.95. Moreover, the relationship between hydroelectricity consumption and 
life expectancy in the 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, and 0.9 quantiles is negative and 
significant. Accordingly, based on the results, the impact of petroleum and 
other liquids consumption, government service delivery, and Gini coefficient on 
life expectancy in all quantiles is positive and only the impact of the Gini 
coefficient on life expectancy in all quantiles is significant.

The main aim of this scoping review was to understand how work-related quality 
of life (WRQoL) in adult social care has been defined and measured in the 
literature and to map key components of WRQoL among those working in adult 
social care and similar contexts. The scoping review included studies that: 1- 
focused on WRQoL/work-related wellbeing (and their synonyms); and 2- included 
adult social care or community health care. We searched existing evidence from 
November 2019 until July 2020 through an electronic literature search of eight 
major databases complemented by the grey literature, searching the reference 
lists and by contacting our existing network of experts in the field. In 
addition, we repeated the searches to identify any relevant literature published 
in 2021. Reporting followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) checklist. In total, we included 68 publications. These 
publications indicate that there is an absence of agreement on a definition and 
measurement of WRQoL in adult social care. Based on a thematic analysis we 
identified six key components of WRQoL: organisational characteristics; job 
characteristics; mental wellbeing and health; physical wellbeing and health; 
spill-over from work to home; and professional identity. In summary, at the 
moment, there is no agreement on what WRQoL is and how to measure it in adult 
social care. As a result, there is very limited evidence on how to improve WRQoL 
among people working in adult social care. However, this scoping review suggests 
that there are six key components of WRQoL that researchers may consider to 
include in their future studies.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary risks have always been a major risk factor for 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially in young people. This article aimed 
to provide an updated and comprehensive view of the spatial, temporal and sexual 
heterogeneity in diet-attributable CVD burdens from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on diet-attributable CVD burdens were extracted from 
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. Numbers and age-standardized 
rates (ASRs) of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and corresponding 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were determined. Globally, the number 
of diet-attributable CVD deaths and DALYs in 2019 were 6.9 million and 153.2 
million, marking 43.8% and 34.3% increases since 1990, respectively. However, 
ASRs of death and DALYs have declined over time. The regions with the highest 
ASRs of diet-related CVD deaths and DALYs were in Central Asia, whereas the 
lowest ASRs of CVD deaths and DALYs were observed in the high-income Asia 
Pacific region. Globally, men suffered higher death and DALY burdens than women. 
Ischemic heart disease and stroke were the leading causes of CVD deaths and 
DALYs, globally. Regarding the specific diet group, diets low in whole grains, 
high in sodium, low in fruits, low in nuts and seeds, low in vegetables and low 
in seafood omega-3 fatty acids contributed to CVD deaths and DALYs the most. 
Dietary risks accounted for a higher proportion in people aged less than 65 
years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet-attributable CVDs threaten public health, particularly in low 
SDI countries and younger generations. As diet-related CVDs are nation-specific, 
the prioritization of public health interventions should be evidence-based.

BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has allowed for viral load 
(VL) suppression and increased life expectancy for persons with HIV (PWH). 
Altered brain integrity, measured by neuropsychological (NP) performance and 
neuroimaging, is still prevalent among virally suppressed PWH. Age-related 
conditions such as cardiovascular disease may also affect brain integrity. This 
study investigated the effects of cardiovascular risk, VL, and HIV serostatus on 
cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain volumetrics, and cognitive function in PWH and 
persons without HIV (PWoH).
METHODS: Ten-year cardiovascular risk, using the Framingham Heart Study 
criteria, was calculated in PWH (n = 164) on cART with undetectable (≤20 
copies/mL; n = 134) or detectable (>20 copies/mL; n = 30) VL and PWoH (n = 66). 
The effects of cardiovascular risk on brain integrity (CBF, volume, and 
cognition) were compared for PWH (undetectable and detectable VL) and PWoH.
RESULTS: PWH had smaller brain volumes and worse NP scores than PWoH. PWH with 
detectable and undetectable VL had similar brain integrity measures. Higher 
cardiovascular risk was associated with smaller volumes and lower CBF in 
multiple brain regions for PWH and PWoH. Significant interactions between HIV 
serostatus and cardiovascular risk on brain volumes were observed in frontal, 
orbitofrontal, and motor regions. Cardiovascular risk was not associated with 
cognition for PWH or PWoH.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging, but not cognitive measures, was associated with 
elevated cardiovascular risk. HIV serostatus was associated with diminished 
brain volumes and worse cognition while CBF remained unchanged, reflecting 
potential protective effects of cART. Neuroimaging measures of structure 
(volume) and function (CBF) may identify contributions of comorbidities, but 
future longitudinal studies are needed.

RNAi therapy with givosiran significantly reduces attack rates in acute 
intermittent porphyria.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of inherited metabolic disorders that 
affect hepatic heme biosynthesis. They are associated with attacks of 
neurovisceral manifestations that can be life threatening and constitute what is 
considered an acute porphyria attack. Until recently, the sole specific 
treatment for acute porphyria attacks consisted of the intravenous 
administration of hemin. Although attacks are often sporadic, some patients 
develop recurrent acute attacks, with devastating effects on quality of life. 
Liver transplantation has historically been the sole curative treatment option. 
The clinical manifestations of AHP are attributed to the accumulation of the 
heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Advances 
in molecular engineering have provided new therapeutic possibilities for 
modifying the heme synthetic pathway. We reviewed the background and current 
status of AHP treatment using liver-directed small interfering RNA targeting 
ALAS1. The therapeutic aim was to normalize the levels of ALAS1, which is highly 
upregulated during acute porphyria attacks. Givosiran is now an approved drug 
for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. The results of 
clinical trials have shown that givosiran treatment leads to a rapid and 
sustained reduction of ALAS1 mRNA, decreased heme precursor levels, and a 
decreased rate of acute attacks compared with placebo. The clinical trials 
(phases I, II, and III) were all randomized and placebo controlled. Many 
patients enrolled in the initial clinical trials have continued treatment in 
open label extension and extended/compassionate-use programs in countries where 
givosiran is not yet commercially available.

Breast cancer screening in the United States is complicated by conflicting 
recommendations from professional and governmental organizations. The benefits 
and risks of breast cancer screening differ though by age which should influence 
shared decision-making discussions. Compared to older women, women ages 40 to 
49 years have a lower risk of breast cancer, but the types of breast cancer that 
develop are often more aggressive with a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, younger 
women have a longer life expectancy and fewer comorbidities. The primary 
benefits of screening for women in their 40s are a reduction in breast cancer 
mortality, years of life lost to breast cancer, and morbidity of breast cancer 
treatment by detecting cancers at an earlier stage. Compared to older women, the 
risks of breast cancer screening in women ages 40 to 49 years includes more 
false positive recalls and biopsies as well as transient anxiety. Concerns 
regarding radiation induced malignancy and overdiagnosis are minimal in this age 
group. The shorter lead time of breast cancer in women ages 40 to 49 years also 
favors shorter screening intervals. This information should help inform 
providers in their shared decision-making discussions with patients.

BACKGROUND: The global community is faced with aging societies, which will 
result in increased health care costs. we have been introducing our 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)-certified health education 
system in Thailand and Indonesia.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to collect data on the effects of this 
ISO-certified health education system, to extend the healthy life expectancy and 
to study the feasibility of implementing this program and in new social 
contexts.
METHODS: We implemented the health education program recruiting 43, 114 and 119 
participants, respectively, in Japan, Thailand and Indonesia. The participants' 
conditions before and after the program were determined through anthropometry, 
physical fitness tests, blood chemistry tests, brain function tests and 
pedometry.
RESULTS: Regarding pedometry, the Japanese participants took the highest number 
of daily steps on average, followed by the Indonesian and Thai participants. In 
the 10-m obstacle walk, the Thai and Indonesian participants had significantly 
increased times. Furthermore, the differentiation reaction time, reverse 
differentiation reaction time, total number of "misses", total number of 
"mistakes" and total number of errors significantly improved.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to implement a program of an ISO-certified health 
education system, but how to develop exercise habits is important.

The production, compilation, and publication of death registration records is 
complex and usually involves many institutions. Assessing available data and the 
evolution of the completeness of the data compiled based on demographic 
techniques and other available data sources is of great importance for countries 
and for having timely and disaggregated mortality estimates. In this paper, we 
assess whether it is reasonable, based on the available data, to assume that 
there is a sex difference in the completeness of male and female death records 
in Peru in the last 30 years. In addition, we assess how the gap may have 
evolved with time by applying two-census death distribution methods on 
health-related registries and analyzing the information from the Demographic and 
Health Surveys and civil registries. Our findings suggest that there is no 
significant sex difference in the completeness of male and female health-related 
registries and, consequently, the sex gap currently observed in adult mortality 
estimates might be overestimated.

Blend films with poly(ε-caprolactone)(PCL) and poly(propylene 
carbonate)(PPC)with thickness of approximately 40 μm and 60 μm, respectively, 
were prepared using a uniaxial-stretching extrusion process to modify the 
property of PCL. PCL/PPC blend films with better comprehensive properties with 
thickness about 60 μm were used for equilibrium-modified atmosphere packaging of 
button mushrooms at 5 °C. The gas barrier property together with water vapor 
permeability were evaluated as well as its effects on the shelf life button 
mushrooms. The results showed that the PCL/PPC20 and PCL/PPC50 blend films have 
suitable gas barrier property and water vapor permeability, which was helpful to 
generate an appropriate storage environment and more importantly no condensation 
occurred in these two packages. The lower weight loss of button mushrooms was 
observed for PCL/PPC20 and PCL/PPC50 blend films 4.43 and 4.46, respectively. 
The PCL/PPC blend films was more effective in decreasing the activity of PPO and 
preserving the color of the button mushrooms. The over market acceptability of 
button mushrooms packaged in PCL/PPC blend films still maintained good and 
within the limit of marketability after 17 days of storage.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted social life. Gardens and yards have 
seemingly risen as a lifeline during the pandemic. Here, we investigated the 
relationship between people and gardening during the COVID-19 pandemic and what 
factors influenced the ability of people to garden. We examined survey responses 
(n = 3,743) from gardeners who reported how the pandemic had affected personal 
motivations to garden and their use of their gardens, alongside pandemic-related 
challenges, such as food access during the first wave of COVID-19 (May-Aug 
2020). The results show that for the respondents, gardening was overwhelmingly 
important for nature connection, individual stress release, outdoor physical 
activity and food provision. The importance of food provision and economic 
security were also important for those facing greater hardships from the 
pandemic. While the literature on gardening has long shown the multiple benefits 
of gardening, we report on these benefits during a global pandemic. More 
research is needed to capture variations in public sentiment and practice - 
including those who do little gardening, have less access to land, and reside in 
low-income communities particularly in the global south. Nevertheless, we argue 
that gardening can be a public health strategy, readily accessible to boost 
societal resilience to disturbances.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can have multiple localizations in the human body 
however, most often, it appears in the in thorax at tracheobronchial tree and 
the thymus. NETs are a group of tumors with heterogenous malignancy that evolve 
from neuroendocrine cells, with the lung being the second target organ after the 
gastrointestinal tract. These rare tumors are usually asymptomatic and 
non-functional with little information regarding incidence in the specialty 
literature. The main purpose of this review, was the analysis of the available 
literature in all aspects while mainly focusing on molecular diagnosis data and 
secondly, by using this molecular landscape to establish a differentiation of 
lung neuroendocrine tumors (LNETs). By analyzing the literature, new data were 
revealed regarding histological evaluation, genetic aberrations, prognosis 
depending on the type of LNET and therapeutic options that derive from these. 
Efficient management of these tumors is essential in the handling of symptoms 
and increase in life expectancy, especially in patients with functional tumors. 
Histological differentiation of LNETs is important in establishing proper 
therapeutic options and prognosis. Combined types of LNETs remain a 
controversial topic of discussion regarding diagnosis and treatment, a topic on 
which further studies are required in order to improve diagnosis in this group 
of tumors with heterogenous malignancy.

BACKGROUND: Calorie restriction (CR) is known as a nutritional gold standard for 
life extension and different studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF1) reduction through CR may be involved in CR's anti-aging effects. Besides, 
time-restricted-feeding (TRF) is also highlighted due to more feasibility and 
positive health effects. We designed this study to compare the effects of CR and 
TRF on IGF1 and other metabolic parameters.
METHODS: Fifty-two male Wistar rats (3 weeks old) were subjected to either a 
control (CON, n = 11) diet or high-fat diet (HFD, n = 42) for 17 weeks. In the 
second phase of the study, the HFD group were divided into four groups (n = 9) 
1) 30% CR, 2) Night Intermittent Fasting (NIF, active phase), 3) day 
intermittent fasting (DIF, rest phase), and 4) Ad-Libitum (AL) with a standard 
diet for 10 weeks. Blood samples were collected at the end of both phases.
RESULTS: HFD increased IGF1 and deteriorated lipid profiles, except for 
triglycerides (P: 0.018, 0.008.0.012, 0.032) but CR in these obese subjects 
could not lower the IGF1 level. HDL significantly decreased in DIF compared to 
CON and CR (P; 0.001). Meanwhile, HOMA-IR increased in DIF and was significant 
compared to CR (P: 0.002). Serum glucose levels decreased in CR compared to all 
groups except for CON (P: 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Data indicates the role of previous obesity on the effect of CR on 
the IGF1 level and highlights the effect of inappropriate time of food intake on 
HDL and APOA1.

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is an atypical, life-threatening polymicrobial 
infection characterized by the rapid destruction of soft tissue, predominantly 
in the perineal region. Retroperitoneal spread of FG represents an uncommon 
condition described in a few case reports, and its presentation as the first 
manifestation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is even more infrequent. Here, we present the 
case of a 40-year-old male who was admitted to the emergency department with a 
low-grade fever of 37.8°C, abdominal pain, and four-day history of sharp, 
bilateral testicular pain and swelling. On physical examination, the patient was 
hypotensive with necrotic tissue in the perineum. A computed tomography study 
displayed an extensive retroperitoneal spread of suspected FG. Due to the 
massive spread of the infection, an HIV test was requested, yielding positive 
results, which indicated that HIV/AIDS had first manifested as FG with 
retroperitoneal extension. This is an extremely rare initial presentation of 
HIV/AIDS. To treat the patient and address the severe necrosis, a peritoneal 
lavage, surgical debridement, right orchiectomy, and colostomy were performed. 
After the procedure, antiretroviral therapy was established with tenofovir, 
emtricitabine, and efavirenz.

Khagaria, IND.

Dystrophinopathy is a spectrum of muscular dystrophies resulting from absolute 
to relative deficiency of dystrophin - a protein essential for muscle fiber 
integrity. This includes a severe form called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a 
mild form called Becker muscular dystrophy, and intermediate muscular dystrophy. 
Becker muscular dystrophy relates to late-onset and slow progression muscle 
dystrophy caused by deletions or duplications in the dystrophin gene. 
Individuals with this type of tardive slow progression have a life expectancy of 
60 years. A patient in his late 40s presented this disease with duplication of 
exon 2 in the dystrophin gene.

Worldwide, more than 200 million people are infected with filariae which can 
cause severe symptoms leading to reduced quality of life and contribute to 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In particular, lymphatic filariasis (LF) 
caused by Wuchereria bancrofti can lead to lymphedema (LE) and consequently 
presents a serious health problem. To understand why only a fraction of the 
infected individuals develop pathology, it is essential to understand how 
filariae regulate host immunity. The central role of T cells for immunity 
against filariae has been shown in several studies. However, there is little 
knowledge about T cell exhaustion, which causes T cell dysfunction and impaired 
immune responses, in this group of individuals. Recently, we showed that LE 
patients from Ghana harbor distinct patterns of exhausted effector and memory 
CD8+ T cell subsets. Based on these findings, we now characterized CD4+ T cell 
subsets from the same Ghanaian patient cohort by analyzing distinct markers 
within a 13-colour flow cytometry panel. We revealed that LE patients had 
increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing exhaustion-associated receptors 
such as KLRG-1, TIM-3 and PD-1 compared to healthy endemic normal and 
W. bancrofti-infected individuals. Moreover, CD4+ T cells in LE patients were 
characterized by distinct co-expression patterns of inhibitory receptors. 
Collectively with the previous findings on CD8+ T cell exhaustion patterns, the 
data shown here demonstrates that filarial LE patients harbor distinct subsets 
of exhausted T cells. Thus, T cell exhaustion patterns in LE patients need 
attention especially in regards to susceptibility of concomitant infections and 
should be taken into consideration for LE management measures.

Trends of Healthy Life Expectancy of the Elderly in China in 1994-2015: 
Revisiting From the Perspective of Morbidity Transition.

Research on healthy life expectancy (HLE) in China has been fueled by a spate of 
new data sources and studies, yet no consensus is reached on the pattern of HLE 
changes and the underlying mechanism. This study examined the change of HLE in 
China over 20 years with long term national data. Health status, measured by 
activities of daily living, is combined with mortality to calculate the 
disability-free life expectancy by the Sullivan method. The results show that 
the HLE rose slower than life expectancy (LE) in 1994-2004, indicating morbidity 
expansion. However, in 2010-2015, the proportion of HLE to LE increased, 
manifesting morbidity compression. A counterfactual analysis further shows that 
health improvement has been increasingly important in increasing HLE in 
2010-2015, despite the dominance of mortality decline. The findings suggest that 
morbidity can transition between compression, expansion and dynamic equilibrium 
over a long period due to different combinations of mortality and health 
improvements. Given the limited data in this study, whether and how morbidity 
transitions unfold in the future remains open and requires further research.

Beyond the Lesion: Back to High Fidelity DNA Synthesis.

Kaszubowski JD(1), Trakselis MA(1).

Author information:

States.

High fidelity (HiFi) DNA polymerases (Pols) perform the bulk of DNA synthesis 
required to duplicate genomes in all forms of life. Their structural features, 
enzymatic mechanisms, and inherent properties are well-described over several 
decades of research. HiFi Pols are so accurate that they become stalled at sites 
of DNA damage or lesions that are not one of the four canonical DNA bases. Once 
stalled, the replisome becomes compromised and vulnerable to further DNA damage. 
One mechanism to relieve stalling is to recruit a translesion synthesis (TLS) 
Pol to rapidly synthesize over and past the damage. These TLS Pols have good 
specificities for the lesion but are less accurate when synthesizing opposite 
undamaged DNA, and so, mechanisms are needed to limit TLS Pol synthesis and 
recruit back a HiFi Pol to reestablish the replisome. The overall TLS process 
can be complicated with several cellular Pols, multifaceted protein contacts, 
and variable nucleotide incorporation kinetics all contributing to several 
discrete substitution (or template hand-off) steps. In this review, we highlight 
the mechanistic differences between distributive equilibrium exchange events and 
concerted contact-dependent switching by DNA Pols for insertion, extension, and 
resumption of high-fidelity synthesis beyond the lesion.

Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) increased the life expectancy of people 
living with HIV (PLHIV) and remarkably reduced the morbidity and mortality 
associated with HIV infection. However, non-AIDS associated comorbidities 
including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD) are increasingly reported among PLHIV receiving cART. Killer cell 
immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) 
cells have been previously implicated in controlling HIV disease progression. 
The aim of this study is to investigate the role of KIRs in developing non-AIDS 
associated comorbidities among PLHIV. Demographic and behavioral data were 
collected from voluntary participants using a standardized questionnaire. Whole 
blood samples were collected for KIR genotyping. Hypertension (29.5%) and 
hyperlipidemia (29.5%) followed by diabetes (23.7%) and CVD (9.7%) were mainly 
reported among our study participants with higher rate of comorbid conditions 
observed among participants > 40 years old. The observed KIR frequency (OF) was 
≥90% for inhibitory KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1, activating KIR2DS4 and the pseudogene 
KIR2DP1 among study participants. We detected significant differences in the 
expression of KIR3DS4 and KIR3DL1 (p = 0.038) between diabetic and nondiabetic 
and in the expression of KIR2DL3 between hypertensive and normotensive 
HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.047). Moreover, KIR2DL1 and KIR2DP1 were 
associated with significantly reduced odds of having CVD (OR 0.08; 95% CI: 
0.01-0.69; p = 0.022). Our study suggests the potential role of KIR in 
predisposition to non-AIDS comorbidities among PLHIV and underscores the need 
for more studies to further elucidate the role of KIRs in this population.

Populations in Asian developed economies are rapidly ageing, such that, 
currently, Hong Kong and Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth for 
both men and women. However, extended lifespan is not necessarily accompanied by 
prolongation of health span, such that there is increasing prevalence of frailty 
and dependency, which translates into increase in complex health and social 
needs as well as increase in absolute numbers of older adults that require such 
needs. Consideration of social determinants of healthy ageing would be important 
in the design of equitable health and social care systems. There is a trend 
towards development of integrated medical social care in the community in Asian 
countries. Long-term care insurance and also philanthropic support play a role 
in the financing of such care models.

PURPOSE: Under a societal perspective, disease and treatment attributes that the 
general public deem important should be considered within value frameworks. The 
objective was to investigate how members of the general public value attributes 
beyond health gains and healthcare system expenditures; and better understand 
their perspectives regarding the importance of attributes typically 
characterizing rare genetic diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit feedback on the 
importance of disease and treatment attributes from general public participants 
from three US cities. Participants ranked attributes (scale, 1-10) in terms of 
importance for future research, reported their rationale for ranking, and 
provided feedback specific to rare diseases. Interview transcripts were coded 
using NVivo for thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The 33 participants (median age, 51 years; 48.5% male) ranked disease 
severity (mean [median] ranking, 8.7 [9.0]), treatment availability (8.7 [9.0]), 
and impact on life expectancy (8.4 [9.0]), as most important. The impact on the 
family, need for equity, and intrinsic value of life were frequently provided 
rationales. While rare disease as an attribute received a relatively low ranking 
(6.1 [7.0]), 88% of participants prioritized disease profiles including 
attributes of severity, health related quality of life (HRQoL) impact, limited 
lifespan and young age at onset.
CONCLUSION: Attributes including disease severity, impact on life expectancy and 
HRQoL, and treatment availability were all highly important to members of the 
general public. These findings support the growing evidence regarding the 
importance of expanding value assessments to include attributes considered 
important from a societal perspective.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a 12-month regimen of oral 
capecitabine versus a standard 6-month regimen as postoperative adjuvant 
chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer.
METHODS: We utilized patient-level data from a multi-institutional randomized 
controlled trial (JFMC37-0801) that investigated prolonged oral fluoropyrimidine 
monotherapy. The analysis considered three health states: stable disease, 
post-metastasis, and death. A parametric statistical model with a cure model was 
used to estimate the survival curve. The analysis was conducted from the 
Japanese public healthcare payer's perspective, considering only direct medical 
costs. A lifetime horizon was used, with a discount rate of 2% for both cost and 
health outcomes. Health outcomes were evaluated in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The estimated cure rates for colon cancer were 0.726 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.676-0.776] and 0.694 (95% CI 0.655-0.733) with the 12- and 
6-month regimens, respectively; and the estimated 5-year relapse-free survival 
rates were 74.4% and 69.8%, respectively. The estimated lifetime cost for 
12 months of capecitabine was JPY 3.365 million (USD 31,159), compared with JPY 
3.376 million (USD 31,262) for 6 months. The estimated QALY were 12.48 and 11.77 
for the 12- and 6-month regimens, respectively. Thus, the 12-month capecitabine 
regimen was dominant. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of JPY 5 million per 
QALY, we determined a 97.4% probability that the 12-month capecitabine regimen 
is more cost-effective than the 6-month regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Twelve months of capecitabine is the favorable option for 
postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer from the 
perspective of cost-effectiveness.
