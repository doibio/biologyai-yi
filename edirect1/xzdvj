SETTING: Health inequities exist in rural communities across Canada, as rural 
residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to experience injuries, 
chronic conditions, obesity, and shorter life expectancy. Cooperative and 
coordinated action across sectors is required to both understand and address 
these complex public health issues.
INTERVENTION: The Alberta Healthy Communities Approach (AHCA) is based on the 
values and core building blocks of the Healthy Communities Approach, a framework 
centred on building community capacity to support community-led actions on the 
determinants of health. Adaptations within the AHCA focused on implementation 
mechanisms with a 5-step process and supporting implementation and assessment 
tools for multisectoral team building. Local measurement of change was enhanced 
and focused on community capacity and multisectoral action stages. Between 2016 
and 2019, the AHCA was piloted with 15 rural communities across Alberta with 
population sizes ranging from 403 to 15,051 people.
OUTCOMES: While communities piloting the AHCA ranged in the level of diversity 
of their coalition membership and partnerships, members' reflections demonstrate 
that intentional engagement with diverse citizens and sectors is pivotal to 
collaboratively identifying local assets and priorities and mobilizing 
cross-sectoral action that will sustainably improve supportive environments for 
cancer and chronic disease prevention.
IMPLICATIONS: Engaging across sectors, building partnerships, and establishing a 
multisectoral team increase diversity and can catalyze community-led 
prioritization and actions for asset-based community development. An increase in 
diversity may lead to increased investment and sustainability at the community 
level.

Publisher: RéSUMé: LIEU: Il existe des iniquités en santé dans les communautés 
rurales de tout le Canada, car les résidents ruraux sont plus susceptibles que 
leurs homologues urbains de connaître des blessures, des affections chroniques, 
l’obésité et une espérance de vie plus courte. Une action coopérative et 
coordonnée entre plusieurs secteurs est nécessaire à la fois pour comprendre ces 
problèmes de santé publique complexes et pour les aborder. INTERVENTION: 
L’approche des Communautés en santé de l’Alberta (AHCA) repose sur les valeurs 
et les composantes de base de l’approche des Communautés en santé, un cadre axé 
sur le renforcement des moyens de proximité pour soutenir des actions 
communautaires sur les déterminants de la santé. Les adaptations de l’AHCA ont 
porté sur les mécanismes de mise en œuvre de l’approche, dont un processus en 
cinq étapes et une aide à la création d’outils de mise en œuvre et d’évaluation 
pour la consolidation d’équipes multisectorielles. Les instruments de mesure du 
changement à l’échelle locale ont été améliorés et recentrés sur les moyens de 
proximité et les étapes de l’action multisectorielle. Entre 2016 et 2019, l’AHCA 
a été mise à l’essai dans 15 communautés rurales de l’Alberta comptant entre 403 
et 15 051 habitants. RéSULTATS: Les communautés dans lesquelles l’AHCA a été 
mise à l’essai présentaient différents degrés de diversité dans les membres et 
les partenaires de leurs coalitions, mais les réflexions des membres montrent 
que la mobilisation intentionnelle d’une forte mixité de citoyens et de secteurs 
est cruciale pour définir de façon concertée les priorités et les atouts locaux 
et pour mobiliser une action intersectorielle qui instaure durablement des 
milieux favorables à la prévention du cancer et des maladies chroniques. 
CONSéQUENCES: L’implication de plusieurs secteurs, la création de partenariats 
et la formation d’une équipe multisectorielle accroissent la diversité et 
peuvent accélérer la définition des priorités collectives et les actions de 
développement de proximité fondées sur les atouts. Une augmentation de la 
diversité peut mener à des investissements et à une durabilité accrus à 
l’échelle des communautés.

BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic diseases is rapidly rising, both in terms of 
morbidity and mortality. This burden is disproportionally carried by socially 
disadvantaged population subgroups. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measure 
the impact of disease on mortality and morbidity into a single index. This study 
aims to estimate the burden of chronic diseases in terms of QALY losses and to 
model its social distribution for the general population.
METHODS: The Belgian Health Interview Survey 2013 and 2018 provided data on 
self-reported chronic conditions for a nationally representative sample. The 
annual QALY loss per 100,000 individuals was calculated for each condition, 
incorporating disease prevalence and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data 
(EQ-5D-5L). Socioeconomic inequalities, based on respondents' socioeconomic 
status (SES), were assessed by estimating population attributable fractions 
(PAF).
RESULTS: For both years, the largest QALY losses were observed in dorsopathies, 
arthropathies, hypertension/high cholesterol, and genitourinary problems. QALY 
losses were larger in women and in older individuals. Individuals with high SES 
had consistently lower QALY loss when facing a chronic disease compared to those 
with low SES. In both years, a higher PAF was found in individuals with hip 
fracture and stroke. In 2013, the health inequality gap amounts to 33,731 QALYs 
and further expanded to 42,273 QALYs in 2018.
CONCLUSION: Given that chronic diseases will rise in the next decades, 
addressing its burden is necessary, particularly among the most vulnerable (i.e. 
older persons, women, low SES). Interventions in these target groups should get 
priority in order to reduce the burden of chronic diseases.

AIMS: Data on long-term treatment effects are scarce, despite the intent to use 
new therapies for many years and the need of patients, physicians and payers to 
have a better understanding of the lifetime benefits of treatments. The 
restricted mean or median survival time (RMST) calculated using age instead of 
time, hypothetically enables estimation of long-term gain in event-free or 
overall survival from the short-term (within-trial) effects of an intervention, 
compared with its control. Tha aim of the study is to use trials with long-term 
follow-up available through extension studies to compare the long-term 
projections estimated using RMST from within-trial follow-up data with the 
actual long-term outcomes in the extension studies.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated the median long-term survival time using age 
instead of follow-up time and compared these model-based projections with the 
actual long-term estimates in the (i) SCD-HeFT trial vs. SCD-HeFT long-term 
outcomes; (ii) SOLVD trial vs. SOLVD 12 year follow-up; (iii) STICH trial vs. 
STICHES; and (iv) ACCORD study vs. ACCORDION. In the long-term follow-up of 
SCD-HeFT, gain in survival with ICD vs. placebo over a median of 11.0 years was 
+1.4 years of life. The RMST model-derived survival projection from the 
within-trial data (median follow-up of 3.4 years) gave an estimated survival 
gain of +1.2 years. In STICHES, over a median follow-up of 9.8 years, coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) vs. medical care led to a survival extension of 
+1.4 years in favour of CABG. RMST projections using within-trial data from 
STICH (median follow-up of 4.9 years), gave an extended survival of +2.4 years 
in favour of CABG in younger patients. In the long-term follow-up of SOLVD, 
enalapril vs. placebo led to a survival gain of +0.8 years over a median 
follow-up of 12.1 years. The RMST projections from the within-trial data (median 
follow-up of 2.8 years) gave a survival extension of +0.3 years in favour of 
enalapril. In the long-term follow-up ACCORDION study, with a median follow-up 
of 8.8 years, intensive vs. a standard anti-hyperglycaemic treatment did not 
influence long-term survival, which was concordant with the RMST projections 
from the short-term ACCORD study with median follow-up of 4.9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-based survival projections using within-trial data generally 
provided concordant results with the actual survival measured in long-term 
follow-up extension studies. Our findings suggest that age-based lifetime 
projections may be used as means to assess the long-term treatment effects.

INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) progressively affects patients' functionality and 
compromises health-related quality of life (HRQL). The aim of this study was to 
quantify the projected long-term treatment effects of inotersen vs placebo on 
HRQL measures.
METHODS: The inotersen phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial NEURO-TTR (NCT01737398, 65 weeks) and its subsequent open-label extension 
(OLE; NCT02175004, 104 weeks) included 172 (112 inotersen and 60 placebo) 
patients. Placebo double-blind period and overall inotersen-inotersen 
(double-blind/OLE) treatment period (170 weeks) data were used to extrapolate 
the long-term placebo-placebo effect using mixed-effects models with repeated 
measures. Changes from baseline in the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic 
Neuropathy (QoL-DN) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) in 
hATTR-PN were estimated. Differences in changes were compared between the 
inotersen-inotersen and extrapolated placebo-placebo arms.
RESULTS: Inotersen-inotersen patients maintained their HRQL with an observed 
change ranging from 10.3% improvement (Norfolk QoL-DN item "Pain kept you awake 
at night") to 11.6% deterioration (SF-36v2 Activities of Daily Living 
subdomain). The extrapolated placebo-placebo results suggest greater 
deterioration over time compared with inotersen-inotersen treatment on Norfolk 
QoL-DN total score (23.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9-38.3; P < .01), 
Activities of Daily Living (4.6; 95% CI, 2.0-7.3; P < .001), and "Pain kept you 
awake at night" (1.2; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P < .01). Similarly, greater 
deterioration was expected for the SF-36v2 Physical Component Summary (8.0; 95% 
CI, 3.2-12.8, P < .01), Bodily Pain (7.8; 95% CI, 2.0-13.5; P < .01), and 
Physical Functioning (10.6; 95% CI, 5.5-15.6; P < .0001).
DISCUSSION: Long-term (>3 years) inotersen treatment was associated with slowing 
and, in some domains, halting of deterioration in key HRQL outcome measures, 
particularly physical functioning and pain.

BACKGROUND: Globally, there is a rising burden of non-communicable diseases 
related to high body mass index (BMI). Estimation of the magnitude of the 
avoidable disease burden related to high BMI in Kenya could inform priority 
setting in health.
METHODS: Using a proportional multistate life table model, we estimated the 
impact of the elimination of exposure to high BMI (>22·5 kg/m2) on health 
adjusted life years, health adjusted life expectancy, and burden of 27 
obesity-related diseases. Participants were the 2019 Kenyan population modelled 
over their remaining lifetime.
FINDINGS: Elimination of high BMI could save approximately 83·5 million 
health-adjusted life years and increase the health-adjusted life expectancy by 
2·3 (95% UI 2·0-2·8) years for females and 1·0 (95% UI 0·8-1·1) years for males. 
Over the first 25 years, over 7·4 million new cases of BMI-related diseases 
could be avoided and approximately half a million BMI related deaths postponed. 
The cumulative number of new cases of type 2 diabetes could reduce by 
approximately 1·6 million, cardiovascular diseases by over 1·3 million, chronic 
kidney disease by 850,473 and cancer would reduce by 55,624 estimated cases. In 
2044, an estimated 867,664 prevalent cases of musculoskeletal disease would be 
prevented.
INTERPRETATION: The magnitude of avoidable high BMI-related disease burden in 
Kenya underscores the need to prioritise the control and prevention of 
overweight and obesity globally, especially in low- and middle-income settings, 
where obesity rates are rising rapidly. Reducing population BMI is challenging, 
but sustained and well-enforced system-wide approaches could be a great starting 
point.

BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a major contributor to cancer-related 
deaths. Data on global and country-specific levels and trends of PLC are 
essential for understanding the effects of this disease and helping policymakers 
to allocate resources.
AIM: To investigate the association between the burden of PLC and socioeconomic 
development status.
METHODS: Cancer mortality and incidence rates were obtained from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019, and the data were stratified by country and 
territory, sex, and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) level. The association 
between the attributable etiology of PLC and socioeconomic development status, 
represented using the SDI, was described. The attributable etiology of PLC 
included hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcohol use, and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis. The association between the attributable etiology of PLC and 
SDI was further stratified by sex and geographical location. A confidence 
analysis was also performed based on bootstrap draw.
RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate of PLC was 6.5 [95% confidence 
intervals (CI): 5.9-7.2] per 100000 person-years, which decreased by -27.5% 
(-37.0 to -16.6) from 1990 to 2019. Several countries located in East Asia, 
South Asia, West Africa, and North Africa shouldered the heaviest burden of PLC 
in 2019. In terms of incidence rates, the first leading underlying cause of PLC 
identified was hepatitis B, followed by hepatitis C, alcohol use, and 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Regarding stratification using the SDI, the 
incidence rate of PLC was the highest for high and middle SDI locations. 
Further, the leading attributable etiologies of PLC were hepatitis B for the 
middle and high middle SDI locations while hepatitis C and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis for the high SDI locations.
CONCLUSION: The pronounced association between socioeconomic development status 
and PLC burden indicates socioeconomic development status affects attributable 
etiologies for PLC. GBD 2019 data are valuable for policymakers implementing PLC 
cost-effective interventions.

For the postoperative treatment of oocyte carcinoma, CT and CT ultrasonography 
combined with microscopic intraperitoneal should be combined with peritoneal 
heat perfusion chemotherapy. The authors selected 50 patients who received 
treatment for ovarian cancer from 2017 to 2018 and divided them into two groups 
(observation group, 30 cases, control group, 20 cases). Cisplatin, associated 
with peritoneal hyperthermia, led the control group, and we monitored all 
patients for 1 year and provided clinical trials, lifestyle, and results for 
both disease group. The experimental results showed that the target reduction 
rate of the control group was 70%, while that of the control group was only 40%, 
lower than that of the control group P < 0.05. The life expectancy of the 
control group was higher than that of the control group, P < 0.05. Nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow compression, and constipation in the study group 
were slightly higher than those in the control group (35%), but there was no 
significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Chemotherapy combined 
with intraperitoneal infusion of loplatin has no side effects, helps improve 
survival, and can be used in a variety of clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the burden and variation trends of cancers in children 
under 5 years at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Epidemiological data for children under 5 years who were diagnosed with 
any one childhood cancer were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) from 1990 to 2019. The outcomes were the 
absolute numbers and rates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for different types of cancer.
RESULTS: In 2019, 8,774,979.1 incident cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
6,243,599.2 to11,737,568.5) and 8,956,583.8 (6,446,323.9 to 12,364,520.8) 
prevalent cases of cancer in children under 5 years were identified worldwide; 
these cancers resulted in 44,451.6 (36,198.7 to 53,905.9) deaths and 3,918,014.8 
(3,196,454.9 to 4,751,304.2) DALYs. From 1990 to 2019, although the numbers of 
incident and prevalent cases only decreased by -4.6% (-7.0 to -2.2) and -8.3% 
(-12.6 to -3.4), respectively, the numbers of deaths and DALYs clearly declined 
by -47.8% (-60.7 to -26.4) and -47.7% (-60.7 to -26.2), respectively. In 2019, 
the middle sociodemographic index (SDI) regions had the highest incidence and 
prevalence, whereas the low SDI regions had the most mortality and DALYs. 
Although all of the SDI regions displayed a steady drop in deaths and DALYs 
between 1990 and 2019, the low-middle and low SDI regions showed increasing 
trends of incidence and prevalence. Leukemia remained the most common cancer 
globally in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the burdens of leukemia, liver cancer, and 
Hodgkin's lymphoma declined, whereas the incidence and prevalence of other 
cancers grew, particularly testicular cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The global childhood cancer burden in young children has been 
steadily decreasing over the past three decades. However, the burdens and other 
characteristics have varied across different regions and types of cancers. This 
highlights the need to reorient current treatment strategies and establish 
effective prevention methods to reduce the global burden of childhood cancer.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery can cause type 2 diabetes (diabetes) remission for 
individuals with comorbid obesity, yet utilization is <1%. Surgery eligibility 
is currently limited to body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m 2 , though the American 
Diabetes Association recommends expansion to BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 .
OBJECTIVE: We estimate the individual-level net social value benefits of 
diabetes remission through bariatric surgery and compare the population-level 
effects of expanding eligibility alone versus improving utilization for 
currently eligible individuals.
METHODS: Using microsimulation, we quantified the net social value (difference 
in lifetime health/economic benefits and costs) of bariatric surgery-related 
diabetes remission for Americans with obesity and diabetes. We compared 
projected lifetime surgical outcomes to conventional management at individual 
and population levels for current utilization (1%) and eligibility (BMI ≥35 kg/m 
2 ) and expansions of both (>1%, and BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ).
RESULTS: The per capita net social value of bariatric surgery-related diabetes 
remission was $264,670 (95% confidence interval: $234,527-294,814) under current 
and $227,114 (95% confidence interval: $205,300-248,928) under expanded 
eligibility, an 11.1% and 9.16% improvement over conventional management. 
Quality-adjusted life expectancy represented the largest gains (current: 
$194,706; expanded: $169,002); followed by earnings ($51,395 and $46,466), and 
medical savings ($41,769 and $34,866) balanced against the surgery cost 
($23,200). Doubling surgical utilization for currently eligible patients 
provides higher population gains ($34.9B) than only expanding eligibility at 
current utilization ($29.0B).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes remission following bariatric surgery improves healthy 
life expectancy and provides net social benefit despite high procedural costs. 
Per capita benefits appear greater among currently eligible individuals. 
Therefore, policies that increase utilization may produce larger societal value 
than expanding eligibility criteria alone.

The most well-studied and widely prescribed fixed-combination drug for 
open-angle glaucoma is latanoprost/timolol. Its significant hypotensive effect 
is especially important in challenging cases, among which are patients with 
normal-tension glaucoma. With long life expectancy and the constant need for 
treatment, requirements are high for both the effectiveness of the drug and its 
tolerability. This paper presents a follow-up of 7 patients with normal-tension 
glaucoma who have been using the fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol for 10 
years. All patients showed very good tolerability to the drug and their quality 
of life was preserved. A moderate rate of disease progression according to 
static perimetry was noted in one case. A mild degree of dry eye syndrome 
according to the OSDI questionnaire and an objective assessment of the state of 
the ocular surface was observed in one patient. The latanoprost/timolol fixed 
combination is a well-tolerated, highly effective and safe long-term treatment 
choice for normal-tension glaucoma.

Publisher: Наиболее хорошо изученной и часто назначаемой при открытоугольной 
глаукоме является фиксированная комбинация латанопрост/тимолол. Ее значительный 
гипотензивный эффект особенно важен в тех случаях, когда снижение давления 
представляет собой сложную задачу. Именно к таким ситуациям относится лечение 
пациентов с глаукомой нормального давления. Большая ожидаемая продолжительность 
жизни и необходимость пожизненного лечения определяют высокие требования не 
только к эффективности терапии, но и к переносимости препарата. В данной работе 
приводится наблюдение за 7 пациентами с глаукомой нормального давления, 
применявшими фиксированную комбинацию латанопрост/тимолол в течение 10 лет. У 
всех пациентов отмечены очень хорошая переносимость комбинации и сохранение 
качества жизни. Умеренная скорость прогрессирования заболевания по данным 
статической периметрии отмечена в 1 случае. У 1 пациента по результатам 
опросника OSDI и объективной оценки состояния глазной поверхности была выявлена 
легкая степень синдрома сухого глаза. Таким образом, фиксированная комбинация 
латанопрост/тимолол является высокоэффективным и безопасным средством для 
долгосрочного лечения глаукомы нормального давления, обладающим хорошей 
переносимостью.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline 
[GSK]) of Benlysta (belimumab) to submit evidence regarding its clinical and 
cost effectiveness, for the review and possible extension of a previously 
conditionally approved intravenous formulation of belimumab for the treatment of 
active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Kleijnen 
Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical 
Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). 
This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical 
review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the 
key methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE 
guidance by the NICE Appraisal Committee.This appraisal is different to the 
previous appraisal in three ways: (1). This appraisal expands its definition of 
'high disease activity'. (2). In TA397, belimumab was approved, with a managed 
access arrangement (MAA), for adults only. This appraisal includes subjects aged 
5 years or older. (3). The original appraisal included an intravenous 
formulation only, but the current appraisal also includes a new subcutaneous 
formulation in the form of a prefilled pen.The company was required to collect 
real-world data from the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Biologics Register 
(BILAG-BR), including data on the efficacy, safety, and effect on health-related 
quality of life of belimumab versus rituximab. This appraisal considers these 
data as well as additional clinical trial evidence presented in the company's 
updated submission to address uncertainties identified during the original 
appraisal. The ERG identified three major concerns with the evidence presented 
on the clinical effectiveness in the current submission; namely, short follow-up 
in the main comparative trials (BLISS-SC, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76); using the 
propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis in calibrating the cost-effectiveness 
model can severely bias the results in favour of belimumab; and BILAG-BR data 
are not suitable for a comparison of belimumab with rituximab.The main issue in 
the economic analysis was the uncertainty about long-term disease activity 
progression and resulting organ damage. The company's approach of calibrating 
modelled organ damage to longer-term data analysed using the PSM analysis was 
methodologically inappropriate. The final analysis comparing belimumab with 
standard treatment for the intravenous formulation resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £12,335 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
and £30,278 per QALY gained in the company's and ERG's base-case analyses, 
respectively. For the subcutaneous formulation, the final analysis resulted in 
£8480 per QALY gained and £29,313 per QALY gained in the company's and ERG's 
base-case analyses, respectively. NICE recommended belimumab in both intravenous 
and subcutaneous formulations as an add-on treatment option for active 
autoantibody-positive SLE in the HDA-2 subgroup.

IMPORTANCE: Cannabidiol has shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials for 
drug-resistant epilepsy in specific syndromes that predominantly affect 
children. However, high-level evidence for the efficacy and safety of 
cannabidiol in the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, focal 
epilepsy, is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
transdermally administered cannabidiol in adults with drug-resistant focal 
epilepsy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial at 14 epilepsy trial centers in 
Australia and New Zealand. Participants were adults with drug-resistant focal 
epilepsy receiving a stable regimen of up to 3 antiseizure medications. Data 
were analyzed from July 2017 to November 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 195-mg or 390-mg 
transdermal cannabidiol or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks, after which they 
could enroll in an open-label extension study for up to 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seizure frequency was self-reported using a daily 
diary. The primary efficacy end point was the least squares mean difference in 
the log-transformed total seizure frequency per 28-day period, adjusted to a 
common baseline log seizure rate, during the 12-week treatment period.
RESULTS: A total of 188 patients (45% male [85 patients] and 54.8% female [103 
patients]) with a mean (SD) age of 39.2 (12.78) years were randomized, treated, 
and analyzed (195-mg cannabidiol, 63 participants; 390-mg cannabidiol, 62 
participants; placebo, 63 participants). At week 12 of the double-blind period, 
there was no difference in seizure frequency between placebo (mean [SD] 2.49 
[1.31] seizures per 28 days) and 195-mg cannabidiol (mean [SD] 2.51 [1.15] 
seizures per 28 days; least squares mean difference, 0.014; 95% CI, -0.175 to 
0.203; P = .89) or 390-mg cannabidiol (mean [SD] 2.59 [1.12] seizures per 28 
days; least squares mean difference, 0.096; 95% CI, -0.093 to 0.285; P = .32). 
By month 6 of the open-label extension, 115 patients (60.8%) achieved a seizure 
reduction of at least 50%. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.4% 
(63 of 125 participants) of the cannabidiol group vs 41.3% (26 of 63 
participants) in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 9.1% (95% CI, 
-6.0% to 23.6%), and occurred at similar rates in the cannabidiol groups. Few 
participants discontinued (7% [14 of 188 participants]), and most (98% [171 of 
174 participants]) continued into the open-label extension.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both doses of transdermal cannabidiol were well 
tolerated and safe. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between 
cannabidiol and placebo during the double-blind treatment period. The open-label 
extension demonstrated the long-term safety, tolerability, and acceptability of 
transdermal cannabidiol delivery.

Despite the recognized importance of women's participation in agricultural 
extension services, research continues to show inequalities in women's 
participation. Emerging capacities for conducting large-scale extension training 
using information and communication technologies (ICTs) now afford opportunities 
for generating the rich datasets needed to analyze situational factors that 
affect women's participation. Data was recorded from 1,070 video-based 
agricultural extension training events (131,073 farmers) in four Administrative 
Divisions of Bangladesh (Rangpur, Dhaka, Khulna, and Rajshahi). The study 
analyzed the effect of gender of the trainer, time of the day, day of the week, 
month of the year, Bangladesh Administrative Division, and venue type on (1) the 
expected number of extension event attendees and (2) the odds of females 
attending the event conditioned on the total number of attendees. The study 
revealed strong gender specific training preferences. Several factors that 
increased total participation, decreased female attendance (e.g., male-led 
training event held after 3:30 pm in Rangpur). These findings highlight the 
dilemma faced by extension trainers seeking to maximize attendance at training 
events while avoiding exacerbating gender inequalities. The study concludes with 
a discussion of ways to mitigate gender exclusion in extension training by 
extending data collection processes, incorporating machine learning to 
understand gender preferences, and applying optimization theory to increase 
total participation while concurrently improving gender inclusivity.

BACKGROUND: CEND-1 is a novel cyclic peptide that targets αV integrins and 
neuropilin-1 and enhances tumour delivery of co-administered anticancer drugs. 
We investigated the safety, tolerability, and biological activity of CEND-1 in 
patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study, conducted at three 
hospitals in Australia, enrolled participants aged 18 years or older with 
histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who had one 
or more lesions measurable on MRI or CT, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status score of 0 or 1, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
Exclusion criteria included previous chemotherapy and brain metastases or other 
malignancy (unless receiving curative intent). There was no randomisation or 
masking. CEND-1 monotherapy was given as an intravenous fluid bolus on day 1 of 
a run-in phase of 7 days (0·2-3·2 mg/kg) followed by CEND-1 plus intravenous 
gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 
28-day treatment cycles until disease progression. The primary safety endpoints 
were incidence, severity, and duration of treatment-emergent and 
treatment-related adverse events; overall survival; and clinical laboratory 
results, which were all assessed in the safety population. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03517176, and the Australian New Zealand 
Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618000804280.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 13, 2018, and Nov 30, 2019, 31 patients were enrolled 
(eight in the dose-escalation phase [cohort 1a] and 23 in the expansion phase 
[cohort 1b]). Two patients were excluded from the efficacy population. No CEND-1 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the safety population (n=31). The most 
common grade 3 or 4 events were neutropenia (17 [55%] patients), anaemia (eight 
[26%]), leukopenia (five [16%]), and pulmonary embolism (four [13%]). Serious 
adverse events occurred in 22 (71%) patients, mostly related to disease 
progression. Ten deaths occurred during the study due to progression of 
metastatic pancreatic cancer (n=9) and a left middle cerebral artery stroke 
(n=1). In the efficacy population (n=29), 17 (59%) patients had an objective 
response, including one complete response and 16 partial responses. After a 
median follow-up of 26 months (IQR 24-30), median overall survival was 13·2 
months (95% CI 9·7-22·5).
INTERPRETATION: CEND-1 with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine has an acceptable 
safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities and encouraging activity. 
Adverse events were generally consistent with those seen with nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine. Further randomised trials to determine the efficacy of CEND-1 are 
warranted.

OBJECTIVES: The estimation of lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
requires the extrapolation of both length and quality of life (QoL). The 
extrapolation of QoL has received little attention in the literature. Here we 
explore the predictive value of "time to death" (TTD) for extrapolating QoL in 
oncology.
METHODS: We used QoL and survival data from the Patient Reported Outcomes 
Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship registry, 
which is linked to The Netherlands Cancer Registry. QoL was assessed with EQ-5D 
and SF-6D. We tested the relationship between TTD and QoL using linear, 2-part, 
and beta regression models. Incremental QALYs were compared using the TTD 
approach and an annual age-related disutility approach using artificial survival 
data with varying mortality rates.
RESULTS: A total of 6 samples with &gt;100 patients each were used for the 
analysis. A declining pattern in QoL was observed when patients were closer to 
death, confirming the predictive value of TTD for QoL. The declining pattern in 
QoL was most pronounced when QoL was measured with SF-6D. Proximity to death had 
a larger impact on QoL than age. Incremental QALYs were higher using the TTD 
approach than annual age-related disutility, ranging from +0.139 to +0.00003 
depending on mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: TTD is a predictor variable for QoL. Using TTD allows 
cost-effectiveness models that lack QoL data to extrapolate morbidity using 
overall survival estimates. The TTD approach generates more incremental QALYs 
than an annual age-related disutility, most notably for longer survival periods.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease studies measure the public health impact of a 
disease in a society. The aim of this study was to quantify the direct burden of 
COVID-19 in the first 12 months of the epidemic in Denmark.
METHODS: We collected national surveillance data on positive individuals for 
SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR, hospitalization data, and COVID-19 mortality reported in 
the period between 26th of February, 2020 to 25th of February, 2021. We 
calculated disability adjusted life years (DALYs) based on the European Burden 
of Disease Network consensus COVID-19 model, which considers mild, severe, 
critical health states, and premature death. We conducted sensitivity analyses 
for two different death-registration scenarios, within 30 and 60 days after 
first positive test, respectively.
RESULTS: We estimated that of the 211,823 individuals who tested positive to 
SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the one-year period, 124,163 (59%; 95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) 112,782-133,857) had at least mild symptoms of disease. The total
