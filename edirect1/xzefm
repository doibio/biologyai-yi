Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by unregulated 
and clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow; these cells produce 
and secrete an anomalous monoclonal immunoglobulin, or a fragment of this, 
called M protein. The clinical manifestations of MM result from the 
proliferation of these plasmocytes, the excessive production of monoclonal 
immunoglobulin and the suppression of normal humoral immunity, leading to 
hypercalcemia, bone destruction, renal failure, suppression of hematopoiesis and 
humoral immunity, increasing the risk for the development of infections. The 
increase in life expectancy of the world population led to a concomitant 
increase in the prevalence of MM, a pathology that usually affects the elderly 
population. The aim of this review is to update the reader on epidemiology, 
diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis with other monoclonal gammopathies, 
systemic treatment and prognosis of MM.

Cardiac device-related endocarditis as a device-therapy complication is a 
growing problem due to higher life expectancy and the increasing number of 
abandoned leads and subclinical symptoms. We reported a case of a 47-year-old 
woman with an implanted pacemaker who was admitted to the clinic for cardiology 
due to the right-sided device-related infective endocarditis of the pacemaker 
leads with vegetations, predominantly in the right atrium and right ventricle 
and complicated by pulmonary embolism. Several years after pacemaker 
implantation, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and started 
immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was treated with prolonged intravenous 
antibiotic therapy. The atrial and ventricular lead was extirpated, and the 
posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve was shaved.

thromboembolic complications: part 1.

Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It 
was once thought to be benign as long as the ventricular rate was controlled, 
however, AF is associated with significant cardiac morbidity and mortality. 
Increasing life expectancy driven by improved health care and decreased 
fertility rates has, in most of the world, resulted in the population aged ≥65 
years growing more rapidly than the overall population. As the population ages, 
projections suggest that the burden of AF may increase more than 60% by 2050. 
Although considerable progress has been made in the treatment and management of 
AF, primary prevention, secondary prevention, and prevention of thromboembolic 
complications remain a work in progress. This narrative review was facilitated 
by a MEDLINE search to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized 
controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The 
search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2021. 
Atrial fibrillation was searched via the terms primary prevention, 
hyperthyroidism, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, catheter ablation, surgical 
ablation, hybrid ablation, stroke prevention, anticoagulation, left atrial 
occlusion and atrial excision. Google and Google scholar as well as 
bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed for additional references. 
In these two manuscripts, we discuss the current strategies available to prevent 
AF, then compare noninvasive and invasive treatment strategies to diminish AF 
recurrence. In addition, we examine the pharmacological, percutaneous device and 
surgical approaches to prevent stroke as well as other types of thromboembolic 
events.

Incremental Learning for Heterogeneous Structure Segmentation in Brain Tumor 
MRI.

Deep learning (DL) models for segmenting various anatomical structures have 
achieved great success via a static DL model that is trained in a single source 
domain. Yet, the static DL model is likely to perform poorly in a continually 
evolving environment, requiring appropriate model updates. In an incremental 
learning setting, we would expect that well-trained static models are updated, 
following continually evolving target domain data-e.g., additional lesions or 
structures of interest-collected from different sites, without catastrophic 
forgetting. This, however, poses challenges, due to distribution shifts, 
additional structures not seen during the initial model training, and the 
absence of training data in a source domain. To address these challenges, in 
this work, we seek to progressively evolve an "off-the-shelf" trained 
segmentation model to diverse datasets with additional anatomical categories in 
a unified manner. Specifically, we first propose a divergence-aware dual-flow 
module with balanced rigidity and plasticity branches to decouple old and new 
tasks, which is guided by continuous batch renormalization. Then, a 
complementary pseudo-label training scheme with self-entropy regularized 
momentum MixUp decay is developed for adaptive network optimization. We 
evaluated our framework on a brain tumor segmentation task with continually 
changing target domains-i.e., new MRI scanners/modalities with incremental 
structures. Our framework was able to well retain the discriminability of 
previously learned structures, hence enabling the realistic life-long 
segmentation model extension along with the widespread accumulation of big 
medical data.

Biodiversity is and always has been an important issue in ecological research. 
Biodiversity can reflect niche partitioning among species at several spatial and 
temporal scales and is generally highest in the tropics. One theory to explain 
it is that low-latitude tropical ecosystems are dominated by species that are 
generally only distributed over a narrow area. This principle is known as 
Rapoport's rule. One previously unconsidered extension of Rapoport's rule may be 
reproductive phenology, where variation in flowering and fruiting length may 
reflect a temporal range. Herein, we collected reproductive phenology data for 
more than 20,000 species covering almost all angiosperm species in China. We 
used a random forest model to quantify the relative role of seven environmental 
factors on the duration of reproductive phenology. Our results showed that the 
duration of reproductive phenology decreased with latitude, although there was 
no obvious change across longitudes. Latitude explained more of the variation in 
the duration of flowering and fruiting phases in woody plants than in herbaceous 
plants. Mean annual temperature and the length of the growing season strongly 
influenced the phenology of herbaceous plants, and average winter temperature 
and temperature seasonality were important drivers of woody plant phenology. Our 
result suggests the flowering period of woody plants is sensitive to temperature 
seasonality, while it does not influence herbaceous plants. By extending 
Rapoport's rule to consider the distribution of species in time as well as 
space, we have provided a novel insight into the mechanisms of maintaining high 
levels of diversity in low-latitude forests.

We present the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a right thigh 
pleomorphic sarcoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation 6 years following 
radiotherapy for a vaginal squamous cell carcinoma. The overall 5-year survival 
for a gynaecological malignancy is more than 80 % and as overall cancer 
survivorship and life expectancy improves, the incidence of radiation-induced 
malignancy is increasing (Bjerkehagen et al., 2013). As the prognosis of those 
malignancies is usually poor, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion to 
try to detect these cases early.

BACKGROUND: CNM-Au8® is a catalytically-active gold nanocrystal neuroprotective 
agent that enhances intracellular energy metabolism and reduces oxidative 
stress. The phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and open 
label extension RESCUE-ALS trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of CNM-Au8 
for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: RESCUE-ALS and its long-term open label extension (OLE) were conducted 
at two multidisciplinary ALS clinics located in Sydney, Australia: (i) the Brain 
and Mind Centre and (ii) Westmead Hospital. The double-blind portion of 
RESCUE-ALS was conducted from January 16, 2020 (baseline visit, first-patient 
first-visit (FPFV)) through July 13, 2021 (double-blind period, last-patient 
last-visit (LPLV)). Participants (N = 45) were randomised 1:1 to receive 30 mg 
of CNM-Au8 or matching placebo daily over 36 weeks in addition to background 
standard of care, riluzole. The primary outcome was mean percent change in 
summed motor unit number index (MUNIX), a sensitive neurophysiological biomarker 
of lower motor neuron function. Change in total (or summated) MUNIX score and 
change in forced vital capacity (FVC) were secondary outcome measures. ALS 
disease progression events, ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) change, 
change in quality of life (ALSSQOL-SF) were assessed as exploratory outcome 
measures. Long-term survival evaluated vital status of original active versus 
placebo randomisation for all participants through at least 12 months following 
last-patient last-visit (LPLV) of the double-blind period. RESCUE-ALS and the 
open label study are registered in clinicaltrials.gov with registration numbers 
NCT04098406 and NCT05299658, respectively.
FINDINGS: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, there was no significant 
difference in the summated MUNIX score percent change (LS mean difference: 7.7%, 
95% CI: -11.9 to 27.3%, p = 0.43), total MUNIX score change (18.8, 95% CI: -56.4 
to 94.0), or FVC change (LS mean difference: 3.6, 95% CI: -12.4 to 19.7) between 
the active and placebo treated groups at week 36. In contrast, survival analyses 
through 12-month LPLV demonstrated a 60% reduction in all-cause mortality with 
CNM-Au8 treatment [hazard ratio = 0.408 (95% Wald CI: 0.166 to 1.001, log-rank 
p = 0.0429). 36 participants entered the open label extension (OLE), and those 
initially randomised to CNM-Au8 exhibited a slower rate of disease progression, 
as measured by time to the occurrence of death, tracheostomy, initiation of 
non-invasive ventilatory support, or gastrostomy tube placement. CNM-Au8 was 
well-tolerated, and no safety signals were observed.
INTERPRETATION: CNM-Au8, in combination with riluzole, was well-tolerated in ALS 
with no identified safety signals. While the primary and secondary outcomes of 
this trial were not significant, the clinically meaningful exploratory results 
support further investigation of CNM-Au8 in ALS.
FUNDING: The RESCUE-ALS was substantially funded by a grant from FightMND. 
Additional funding was provided by Clene Australia Pty Ltd.

Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) is less common than lower extremity 
DVT but is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit 
patients. Increasing cancer incidence, prolonged life expectancy and increasing 
use of intravascular catheters and devices has led to an increased incidence of 
UEDVT. It is also associated with high rates of complications like pulmonary 
embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome and recurrent thrombosis. Clinical prediction 
scores and D-dimer may not be as useful in identifying UEDVT; hence, a high 
suspicion index is required for diagnosis. Doppler ultrasound is commonly 
employed for diagnosis, but other tests like computed tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging venography may also be required in some patients. Contrast 
venography is rarely used in patients with clinical and ultrasound findings 
discrepancies. Anticoagulant therapy alone is sufficient in most patients, and 
thrombolysis and surgical decompression is seldom indicated. The outcome depends 
on the cause and underlying comorbidities.

Various monitoring technologies are being developed to prevent potential 
complications among older adults with cognitive impairment and improve their 
cognitive function. This scoping review identified gaps in the development of 
monitoring-technology devices for cognitive health status and highlights areas 
that require further inquiry. This study used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) 
and the PRISMA extension for the checklist for scoping reviews using the 
eligibility criteria recommended by Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) 
framework. The study population included adults aged 65 years and above, while 
the concept and context are monitoring-technology devices utilized in detecting 
and caring for an older adult with cognitive impairment. Three electronic 
databases (Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched, and a total of 21 
articles met the selection criteria. Several innovative technology-based devices 
for screening, assessing, detecting, and monitoring the interventions for older 
adult cognitive impairment and for family caregivers to ensure the continuity of 
care were established. Monitoring devices are useful in promoting older adult 
safety, improving their quality of life by enabling them to live independently 
for a longer period, and improving their mental wellbeing to help reduce the 
burden on caregivers by providing them with information concerning the 
activities of older adults. Moreover, studies have shown that older adults and 
their caregivers can learn to use these devices effectively and comfortably with 
proper education and training. The results of this study provide crucial 
insights into innovative technologies that can be used to assess cognitive 
health among older adults, which could substantially improve their mental 
health, and this baseline information can be used for supporting public health 
policy and enhancing their quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Ethnic and racial differences in life expectancy have been well 
established in different societies. However, even though an important part of 
the population of Latin America is Indigenous, there is little knowledge about 
them.
OBJECTIVE: Determine if there are ethnic differences in life expectancy at birth 
and at 60 years in Chile, and if the Mapuche (largest Indigenous ethnic group) 
have similar life expectancy to other Indigenous peoples.
METHOD: Life tables for the Mapuche and other Indigenous groups and 
non-Indigenous people were built using the 2017 census. Specifically, we used 
the questions of the number of live children born and the number of surviving 
children. With this information, using the indirect method of own children we 
determined infantile mortality. Then, using the relational logit model and the 
model life table (west), we estimated the survival function for all ages.
RESULTS: Indigenous Chileans have seven years lower life expectancy at birth 
than the non-Indigenous population (76.2 vs. 83.2 years). The differential at 
age 60 is 6 years (20.3 vs. 26.4 years). We also found that Mapuche have an even 
greater disadvantage in survival than other ethnic groups. This is reflected in 
2 years less life expectancy, both at birth and at 60 years.
DISCUSSION: Our results ratify the existence of marked ethnic-racial inequality 
in the extension of life in Chile and demonstrate a greater disadvantage in 
terms of survival of the Mapuche compared to other Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
groups. It is thus of great relevance to design policies that would decrease the 
existing inequalities in lifespan.

INTRODUCTION: Sanfilippo syndrome is a rare disease and fatal genetic disorder 
with no FDA-approved treatment in the United States (US), and no comprehensive 
assessment of economic disease burden is available.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a model to estimate the economic burden associated with 
Sanfilippo syndrome in the US using direct costs, indirect costs and valued 
intangibles (disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs) from 2023 onward.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A multistage comorbidity model was generated based on 
Sanfilippo syndrome symptoms, and disability weights from the 2010 Global Burden 
of Disease Study. Attributable increase in caregiver mental health burden were 
estimated using data from the CDC National Comorbidity Survey and retrospective 
studies on caregiver burden. Direct costs were approximated from the 2019 
EveryLife Foundation survey, and indirect costs were estimated from Federal 
income data. Monetary valuations were adjusted to USD 2023 and given a 3% 
discount rate from 2023 onward.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of Sanfilippo syndrome was calculated for each 
year, and year-over-year DALYs due to patient years lived with disability (YLDs) 
and years life lost (YLLs) were calculated by comparing to the health-adjusted 
life expectancy (HALE) in the US. Direct and indirect costs were calculated for 
each simulated patient from onset of symptoms to death.
RESULTS: From 2023-2043, overall economic burden in the US attributable to 
Sanfilippo syndrome was estimated to be $2.04 billion USD present value (2023) 
with current standard of care. The burden to individual families exceeded $8 
million present value from time of birth per child born with Sanfilippo 
syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Sanfilippo syndrome is a rare lysosomal storage disease, however the 
severe burden associated with the disease for individual families demonstrates a 
considerable cumulative impact. Our model represents the first disease burden 
value estimate associated with Sanfilippo syndrome, and underscores the 
substantial morbidity and mortality burden of Sanfilippo syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Malignant transformation of pelvic osteochondroma is a rare 
entity. Large size and late presentation impose threat to life as well as limb. 
We report a case of limb salvage surgery in an enormously large secondary 
chondrosarcoma arising from pelvic bone.
CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old male presented with a colossal swelling at groin 
reaching up to distal thigh. He was walking with a wide-based gait due to pain 
and discomfort. 30 year back, the patient first reported this swelling of pea 
size, for which he was advised surgery but due to fear of surgery and economic 
reason he refused. Swelling gradually increased in size and reached up to distal 
thigh in the past 30 years. It was hard and non-tender up to 6 months back, when 
suddenly a change in consistency from hard to soft in distal area was noticed. 
On examination, a large soft cystic swelling was hanging from his pubic area. 
Tumor was fixed at base on proximal end. On magnetic resonance imaging, size of 
tumor was 281 mm in length, 263 mm in width, and 250 mm in anteroposterior 
diameter. Tumor was arising from superior and ischiopubic rami. However, no 
intra-articular extension was seen. A radiographic skeletal survey and bone scan 
did not reveal any other lesion. On biopsy, chondrogenic tumor composed of 
lobules of chondroid material with no cellular atypia or evidence of malignancy 
was reported. Considering the age of patient, rapid progression in recent 
months, size and duration of tumor, and type 3 pelvic resection was planned. 
Using utilitarian pelvic incision with perineal extension, separating long 
adductor muscles and deep femoral artery tumor, tumor excised with osteotomy at 
pubic symphysis, and on superior and inferior pubic rami. With minor wound 
complications, wound healed in 3 weeks. Post-operative biopsy reported as Grade 
1 chondrosarcoma. At 3-year follow-up, the patient has no complains and no sign 
of recurrence noticed.
CONCLUSION: Limb salvage surgery is a suitable option even in enormously large 
musculoskeletal malignancy. Proper counseling and tracking of patients are must 
to avoid future complications.

AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the durability of immune response after 
basic and booster immunization with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease 
(CLD).
METHODS: Patients with CLD and complete basic or booster immunization with 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were included in this study. Based on the vaccination 
situation, they were divided into the basic immunity group (Basic) and the 
booster immunity group (Booster), which were then subdivided into four groups 
according to the time interval from completion of basic immunization or booster 
immunization to serological specimen collection. The positive rates and antibody 
titers of novel coronavirus neutralizing antibody (nCoV NTAb) and novel 
coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain antibody (nCoV S-RBD) were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 313 patients with CLD were enrolled in this study, including 
201 in Basic and 112 in Booster. The positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD 
within 30 days of completing basic immunization were 80.4% and 84.8%, 
respectively, but decreased rapidly with the extension of vaccination time, and 
only 29% and 48.4% of patients with CLD remained positive for nCoV NTAb and nCoV 
S-RBD, respectively, after 120 days of completing basic immunization. Within 30 
days of booster immunization, the positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD in 
patients with CLD rapidly increased from 29.0% and 48.4% at the end of basic 
immunization to 95.2% and 90.5%, and maintained a high level (defined as the 
positive rate >50%) until 120 days when the positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV 
S-RBD were still high at 79.5% and 87.2%, respectively. After basic 
immunization, the time for nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD to turn negative was 120 and 
169 days, respectively, and the negative time of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD was 
significantly prolonged to 266 days and 329 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: It is safe and effective for patients with CLD to complete basic and 
booster immunization with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. After booster immunization, the 
immune response of patients with CLD was further improved and the durability of 
the SARS-CoV-2 antibody was significantly prolonged.

Severe mental illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are 
associated with a decrease in life expectancy of up to two decades compared with 
the general population, with cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of 
death. SMI is associated with increased cardiovascular risk profile and early 
onset of incident cardiovascular disease. Following an acute coronary syndrome, 
patients with SMI have a worse prognosis, but are less likely to receive 
invasive treatment. In this narrative review, the management of coronary artery 
disease in patients with SMI is discussed, and avenues for future research are 
highlighted.

IMPORTANCE: Diabetes in children is a global epidemic that causes various 
medical conditions associated with an increased incidence of premature death.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the trends in diabetes incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in children, with risk factors for 
diabetes-associated death, from 1990 to 2019.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study that used 
data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019 in 204 countries and 
territories. Children with diabetes who were aged 0 to 14 years were included in 
the analysis. Data were analyzed from December 28, 2022, to January 10, 2023.
EXPOSURE: Childhood diabetes from 1990 to 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, all-cause and cause-specific deaths, DALYs, 
and corresponding estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs). These trends were 
stratified according to region, country, age, sex, and Sociodemographic Index 
(SDI).
RESULTS: A total of 1 449 897 children (738 923 male [50.96%]) were included in 
the analysis. In 2019, there were 227 580 incident cases of childhood diabetes 
worldwide. Cases of childhood diabetes increased by 39.37% (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI], 30.99%-45.45%) from 1990 to 2019. Over 3 decades, 
diabetes-associated deaths decreased from 6719 (95% UI, 4823-8074) to 5390 (95% 
UI, 4450-6507). The global incidence rate increased from 9.31 (95% UI, 
6.56-12.57) to 11.61 (95% UI, 7.98-15.98) per 100 000 population; however, the 
diabetes-associated death rate decreased from 0.38 (95% UI, 0.27-0.46) to 0.28 
(95% UI, 0.23-0.33) per 100 000 population. Among the 5 SDI regions, the low SDI 
region had the highest childhood diabetes-associated mortality rate in 2019. 
Regionally, North Africa and the Middle East had the largest increase in 
incidence (EAPC, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.94-2.17). Among 204 countries, Finland had the 
highest national incidence of childhood diabetes in 2019 (31.60 per 100 000 
population; 95% UI, 22.65-40.36), Bangladesh had the highest diabetes-associated 
mortality rate (1.16 per 100 000 population; 95% UI, 0.51-1.70), and the United 
Republic of Tanzania had the highest DALYs rate (100.16 per 100 000 population; 
95% UI, 63.01-155.88). Globally, environmental/occupational risk, nonoptimal 
temperature, high temperature, and low temperature were key risk factors for 
childhood diabetes-associated mortality in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Childhood diabetes is an increasing global health 
challenge with rising incidence. Results of this cross-sectional study suggest 
that despite the global decline in deaths and DALYs, the number of deaths and 
DALYs remains high among children with diabetes, especially in low SDI regions. 
Improved understanding of the epidemiology of diabetes in children may 
facilitate prevention and control.

OBJECTIVE: In people, the dose of propofol (DOP) required for procedural 
sedation and anesthesia decreases significantly with age. The objective of this 
study was to determine if the DOP required to perform endotracheal intubation 
decreases with age in dogs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: 1397 dogs.
METHODS: Data from dogs anesthetized at referral center (2017-2020) were 
analyzed with three multivariate linear regression models with backward 
elimination using a combination of either absolute age, physiologic age, or life 
expectancy (ratio between age at the time of anesthetic event and expected age 
of death for each breed obtained from previous literature) as well as other 
factors as independent variables, and DOP as the dependent variable. The DOP for 
each quartile of life expectancy (<25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%, >100%) was 
compared using one-way ANOVA. Significance was set at alpha = 0.025.
RESULTS: Mean age was 7.2 ± 4.1 years, life expectancy 59.8 ± 33%, weight 19 ± 
14 kg, and DOP 3.76 ± 1.8 mg kg-1. Among age models, only life expectancy was a 
predictor of DOP (-0.37 mg kg-1; P = 0.013) but of minimal clinical importance. 
The DOP by life age expectancy quartile was 3.9 ± 2.3, 3.8 ± 1.8, 3.6 ± 1.8, 3.7 
± 1.7, and 3.4 ± 1.6 mg kg-1, respectively (P = 0.20). Yorkshire Terrier, 
Chihuahua, Maltese, mixed breed dogs under 10 kg, and Shih Tzu required higher 
DOP. Status of neutered male, ASA E, and Boxer, Labrador and Golden Retriever 
breeds decreased DOP, along with certain premedication drugs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In contrast to what is observed in people, 
an age cut-off predictive of DOP does not exist. Percentage of elapsed life 
expectancy along with other factors such as breed, premedication drug, emergency 
procedure, and reproductive status significantly alter DOP. In older dogs, the 
dose of propofol can be adjusted based on their elapsed life expectancy.

Chronic cutaneous wounds remain a persistent unmet medical need that decreases 
life expectancy and quality of life. Here, we report that topical application of 
PY-60, a small-molecule activator of the transcriptional coactivator 
Yes-associated protein (YAP), promotes regenerative repair of cutaneous wounds 
in pig and human models. Pharmacological YAP activation enacts a reversible 
pro-proliferative transcriptional program in keratinocytes and dermal cells that 
results in accelerated re-epithelization and regranulation of the wound bed. 
These results demonstrate that transient topical administration of a YAP 
activating agent may represent a generalizable therapeutic approach to treating 
cutaneous wounds.

BACKGROUND: Meningitis is a severe and fatal neurological disease and causes 
lots of disease burden. The purpose of this study was to assess the global, 
regional, and national burdens and trends of meningitis by age, sex, and 
etiology.
METHODS: Data on the burden of meningitis were collected from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019. R and Joinpoint were used 
for statistical analysis and charting.
RESULTS: In 2019, meningitis caused 236,222 deaths and 15,649,865 years of life 
lost (YLL) worldwide. The age-standardized death rate and age-standardized YLL 
rate of meningitis were 3.29 and 225, which decreased steadily. Burden change 
was mainly driven by epidemiological changes. Regionally, meningitis burden was 
the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burden of disease increasingly concentrated 
in low sociodemographic index countries, and this was most pronounced in 
meningitis caused by N. meningitidis. Countries such as Mali, Nigeria, Sierra 
Leone, etc., especially need to enhance the rational allocation of public health 
resources to reduce the disease burden. Children and men were more likely to be 
affected by meningitis. PM2.5 was found to be an important risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive understanding of the 
global disease burden of meningitis caused by specific pathogens and highlights 
policy priorities to protect human health worldwide, with particular attention 
to vulnerable regions, susceptible populations, environmental factors, and 
specific pathogens.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) worldwide is 
approximately 1-2.6/1,000,000 and prevalence is 5-6/100,000. ALS has been 
suggested to be relatively common in Finland, but epidemiological information on 
the subject is scarce and outdated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with ALS diagnostic codes were identified from 
mandatory administrative registries in the provinces of Southwestern Finland 
(population circa 430,000) and North Karelia (population circa 170,000), 
together comprising 11.7% of the total population of Finland. The diagnoses were 
verified, and data were extracted by reviewing the patient records. Incidence 
period was 2010-2018, and the prevalence date was December 31, 2018. 
Age-standardization was performed using the European Standard Population 2013 
(ESP2013).
RESULTS: Overall crude incidence of ALS was 4.2/100,000 person-years in 
Southwestern Finland (ESP2013: 4.0/100,000) and 5.6/100,000 person-years in 
North Karelia (ESP2013: 4.8/100,000), while crude prevalences were 11.9/100,000 
(ESP2013: 10.5/100,000) and 10.9/100,000 (ESP2013: 9.3/100,000), respectively. 
Mean age at diagnosis was 65.5-71.6 years in women (higher in Southwestern 
Finland compared to North Karelia, p = 0.003) and 64.7-67.3 years in men (no 
difference between provinces, p = 0.39). The diagnosis had been made in 50% 
before the age of 70 years in Southwestern Finland and before the age of 65 
years in 51% in North Karelia. Genetic testing had been conducted in 28% of all 
patients with the most common findings being SOD1 and C9orf72. After the 
diagnosis, mean survival was 2.0-2.7 and median survival 1.3-1.4 years. Onset 
phenotype (p &lt; 0.001), age at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), and genotype (p = 
0.001) predicted survival. Riluzole had been used by 25% of patients and 
tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) had been performed in &lt;1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Both incidence and prevalence of ALS in Finland are among the 
highest in the world but with some notable differences between the eastern and 
southwestern parts of the country. Low median life expectancy may be related to 
the advanced age of patients and the high prevalence of C9orf72 repeat expansion 
in Finland as well infrequent use of TIV and riluzole.

BACKGROUND: Medical radiation exposure is of increasing concern in patients with 
cystic fibrosis (PWCF) due to improving life expectancy. We aimed to assess and 
quantify the cumulative effective dose (CED) in PWCF in the context of 
CFTR-modulator therapy and the advancement of dose reduction techniques.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in a single University 
CF centre over a 11-year period. We included PWCF, aged over 18 years who 
exclusively attended our institution. Relevant clinical data (demographics, 
transplantation history and modulator status) and radiological data (modality, 
quantity, and radiation exposure measured as CED) were collected. For those on 
modulator therapy the quantified imaging and radiation data was dichotomised 
into pre-and-post therapy periods.
RESULTS: The study included 181 patients: 139 on CFTR modulator therapy, 15 
transplant recipients and 27 with neither exposure. 82% of patients received <25 
mSv over the study period. Mean study duration was 6.9 ± 2.6 years 
pre-modulation and 4.2 ± 2.6 years post-modulation. Pre-modulation CT 
contributed 9.6% of total chest imaging (n = 139/1453) and 70.9% of the total 
CED. Post-modulation CT use increased contributing 42.7% of chest imaging 
(n = 444/1039) and comprised 75.8% of CED. Annual CED was 1.55 mSv pre and 1.36 
mSv post modulation (p = 0.41). Transplant recipients had an annual CED of 
64 ± 36.1mSv.
CONCLUSION: Chest CT utilisation for PWCF is rising in our institution, 
replacing chest radiography amidst CFTR-modulation. Despite the increasing use
