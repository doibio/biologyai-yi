OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the chemical stability of 
previously dispensed, expired naloxone products.
SETTING: When properly stored, certain products maintain stable, defined as 
within compendia acceptability, beyond their manufacturer's expiration date. 
Stockpiling life-saving medications such as the opioid overdose reversing agent 
naloxone nasal spray (NNS) or injection (NIJ) is of utmost importance to ensure 
public health emergency preparedness and response. Design/interventions/methods: 
After each naloxone product was stored at room temperature for several months 
(6-19) past their labeled expiration date, the level of active therapeutic 
content and the presence of degradation impurity, 2,29'-bisnaloxone, were 
evaluated via chromatographic separation with waters higher performance liquid 
chromatography integrated using the Waters X-Select CSHC-18. The effluent was 
detected at 229 nm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Active naloxone presence and the presence of degradation 
impurity, 2,29'-bisnaloxone, were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean potency of naloxone in both NNS and NIJ, up to 10 and 19 
months post-expiration, respectively, is within the 90-110 percent United States 
Pharmacopeia acceptance limit (NNS: 102.8 ± 2.6 percent and NIJ: 106.0 ± 1.3 
percent). No impurity was detected in any chromatogram of the expired products.
CONCLUSION: In summary, since both NNS and NIJ were found to be chemically 
stable beyond 10 months of the expiration date, shelf-life extension of climate 
controlled, commercially available naloxone products should be further 
investigated as a potential cost savings measure for national strategic 
stockpiles, emergency medical services, hospitals, and public responders.

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether patients treated with a 
caged reconstruction for metastatic acetabular disease would have a construct 
survival superior to that of their life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study, in a single centre in 
the United Kingdom, reviewing outcomes for 19 patients (20 hips) treated with a 
cage reconstruction for metastatic disease of their acetabulum over 6 years. 
Inclusion criteria were those with an impending fracture of the acetabulum, 
metastatic dissociation, fracture of the acetabulum and or femur and those whose 
life expectancy was considered by the oncology team to be >6 months.
RESULTS: In all patients the Restoration GAP II acetabular cage (Stryker, 
Howmedica Osteonics Corp, NJ, USA) was used in conjunction with a cemented 
acetabular cup and cemented femoral stem. The mean age at the time of surgery 
was 68 (44-87) years with breast cancer being the most common primary malignancy 
(31%) followed by prostate cancer (26%).Radiological survivorship estimates were 
94.1% (95% CI, 99.2-65.0) at 12 and 24 months, 70.6% (95% CI, 93.6-16.0) at 
36 months and 35.3% (95% CI, 78.2-1.2) at 48 months. There were 3 radiological 
failures of the implant due to disease progression. Complications occurred in 3 
patients with 2 developing deep infection which was treated with suppressive 
antibiotic therapy following aspiration of the hip. 1 patient suffered a hip 
dislocation following trauma which was successfully reduced closed and no 
further intervention was required.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first published case series of the use of 
the GAP II cage in patients with metastatic acetabular disease. The construct 
generally outlives the patient and hence is suitable for the treatment of 
acetabular metastases.

The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect and potential 
mechanism of melatonin against bisphenol A (BPA)-induced apoptosis and oxidative 
damage in FLK-BLV cells. The results showed that BPA reduced cell viability in a 
dose- and time-dependent manner, caused cell shrinkage and induced oxidative 
stress and apoptosis in FLK-BLV cells, which were effectively reversed by 
melatonin. In addition, BPA caused autophagy flux impairment, which was 
confirmed by the increased of LC3-II and p62 levels, whereas melatonin treatment 
effectively reduced p62 levels under BPA treatment, and reversed 
apoptosis-related protein expression patterns caused by BPA. However, inhibition 
of autophagy by CQ partially abolished the protective effect of melatonin on 
apoptosis, suggesting that melatonin against BPA-induced oxidative injury and 
apoptosis by activating autophagy pathway. Moreover, we found that melatonin 
inhibited BPA-induced the activation of p38 MAPK, which was comparable to 
SB203580 pretreatment, and companied by the activation of autophagy and 
decreases of apoptosis when compared to BPA alone, indicating that melatonin 
protected against BPA-induced apoptosis partially through the p38 MAPK-autophagy 
pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest that melatonin may prevent 
BPA-induced FLK-BLV cell damage by inhibiting p38/MAPK signaling pathway and 
activating autophagy, and it could be a potential therapeutic compound in 
preventing BPA-induced cell damage.

Crowdsourced online genealogies have an unprecedented potential to shed light on 
long-run population dynamics, if analyzed properly. We investigate whether the 
historical mortality dynamics of males in familinx, a popular genealogical 
dataset, are representative of the general population, or whether they are 
closer to those of an elite subpopulation in two territories. The first 
territory is the German Empire, with a low level of genealogical coverage 
relative to the total population size, while the second territory is The 
Netherlands, with a higher level of genealogical coverage relative to the 
population. We find that, for the period around the turn of the 20th century 
(for which benchmark national life tables are available), mortality is 
consistently lower and more homogeneous in familinx than in the general 
population. For that time period, the mortality levels in familinx resemble 
those of elites in the German Empire, while they are closer to those in national 
life tables in The Netherlands. For the period before the 19th century, the 
mortality levels in familinx mirror those of the elites in both territories. We 
identify the low coverage of the total population and the oversampling of elites 
in online genealogies as potential explanations for these findings. Emerging 
digital data may revolutionize our knowledge of historical demographic dynamics, 
but only if we understand their potential uses and limitations.

SignificanceIndia is one of the most hierarchical societies in the world. 
Because vital statistics are incomplete, mortality disparities are not 
quantified. Using survey data on more than 20 million individuals from nine 
Indian states representing about half of India's population, we estimate and 
decompose life expectancy differences between higher-caste Hindus, comprising 
other backward classes and high castes, and three marginalized social groups: 
Adivasis (indigenous peoples), Dalits (oppressed castes), and Muslims. The three 
marginalized groups experience large disadvantages in life expectancy at birth 
relative to higher-caste Hindus. Economic status explains less than half of 
these gaps. These large disparities underscore parallels between diverse systems 
of discrimination akin to racism. They highlight the global significance of 
addressing social inequality in India.

BACKGROUND: An updated analysis of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) from a 
global perspective is missing from the literature. We aimed to assess the global 
burden and trends of NTDs from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Yearly incident case, mortality and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) data for NTDs were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019 (GBD 2019) based on global, regional, country, social development index 
(SDI), age and sex categories. The age-standardized rate (ASR) and number of 
incident cases, mortality and DALYs were computed from 1990 to 2019. The 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the ASR was calculated to quantify 
the changing trend.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and the number of 
incident cases of total NTDs increased between 1990 and 2019, whereas the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), mortality, age-standardized DALY rate 
and DALYs of total NTDs decreased. Although tropical Latin America, South Asia, 
Southeast Asia and Oceania had the highest ASIR for total NTDs in 2019, tropical 
Latin America was the only region to experience a decreasing trend in ASIR from 
1673.5 per 100 000 in 2010 to 1059.2 per 100 000 in 2019. The middle, 
high-middle and high SDI regions experienced increasing ASIR trends between 1990 
and 2019, whereas the low-middle SDI region remained stable, and the low SDI 
region presented a decreasing trend. Children and older adults were vulnerable 
to dengue, rabies and leishmaniasis (cutaneous and mucocutaneous). Females had a 
higher ASIR but a lower ASMR and age-standardized DALY rate than males.
CONCLUSIONS: NTDs still represent a serious problem for public health, and the 
increasing ASIR and incident cases globally may require more targeted strategies 
for prevention, control and surveillance, especially among specific populations 
and endemic areas.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine the genetic and clinical features of 
TARDBP-mutated patients in our cohort of Chinese patients with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) combined with data in the literature.
METHODS: We performed TARDBP mutation screening in 1258 Chinese ALS patients, 
including 1204 sporadic ALS (sALS) and 54 familial ALS (fALS) patients. A 
systematic literature review was conducted by searching TARDBP-mutated patients 
from China in the online databases.
RESULTS: In our cohort, the mutant frequency of TARDBP variants was 0.3% 
(4/1258), with two recurrent variants (p.G294V, p.G298V) and one novel variant 
(p.S332G) identified. Combining with data in the literature review, the 
TARDBP-mutant frequency in the Chinese population was 1.4% (83/5998), with 0.8% 
(46/5470) in sALS and 7.0% (37/528) in fALS. Most patients had limb onset 
(63.0%), with an average life expectancy of 4.3 years (range 0.5-13). Disease 
durations significantly differed (p = 0.002), with p.M337V showing the longest 
duration (80 months) and p.N378D showing the shortest duration (16.7 months).
CONCLUSION: Our study found that TARDBP mutation was not rare in Chinese fALS 
patients. Different TARDBP mutations were associated with specific features in 
phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for a number of communicable 
and non-communicable diseases, including several types of cancer. This article 
reports the burden of cancers attributable to alcohol consumption by age, sex, 
location, sociodemographic index (SDI), and cancer type from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The Comparative Risk Assessment approach was used in the 2019 Global 
Burden of Disease study to report the burden of cancers attributable to alcohol 
consumption between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were globally an estimated 494.7 thousand cancer deaths 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI], 439.7 to 554.1) and 13.0 million cancer 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; 95% UI, 11.6 to 14.5) that were 
attributable to alcohol consumption. The alcohol-attributable DALYs were much 
higher in men (10.5 million; 95% UI, 9.2 to 11.8) than women (2.5 million; 95% 
UI, 2.2 to 2.9). The global age-standardized death and DALY rates of cancers 
attributable to alcohol decreased by 14.7% (95% UI, 6.4% to 23%) and 18.1% (95% 
UI, 9.2% to 26.5%), respectively, over the study period. Central Europe had the 
highest age-standardized death rates that were attributable to alcohol 
consumption(10.3; 95% UI, 8.7 to12.0). Moreover, there was an overall positive 
association between SDI and the regional age-standardized DALY rate for 
alcohol-attributable cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite decreases in age-standardized deaths and DALYs, substantial 
numbers of cancer deaths and DALYs are still attributable to alcohol 
consumption. Because there is a higher burden in males, the elderly, and 
developed regions (based on SDI), these groups and regions should be prioritized 
in any prevention programs.

OBJECTIVES: Improving economy and well-being in developing nations like India 
has expanded life expectancy and changed the attention from transmittable to non 
transmittable diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Tabebuia impetiginosa has 
been utilized by cultivators as a general tonic, immunostimulant, adaptogen and 
also in motor disorders. The present investigation was to explore the 
antiparkinsonian activity of Tabebuia impetiginosa bark by experimental methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Control group-I was served with distilled water. Group-II 
was considered as pathological control 
[1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) 2mg/nostrils i.n, Reserpine 
40mg/kg s.c, Haloperidol 0.5mg/kg, i.p]. Group-III served with standard drug 
(Apomorphine 40mg/kg, s.c). Group IV and V received aqueous extract of Tabebuia 
impetiginosa bark in doses of 300 and 500mg/kg/day respectively. Tremor, 
hypokinesia, muscular rigidity, catatonia, postural immobility, postural 
instability and catalepsy were assessed for antiparkinsonian activity.
RESULTS: The bark extract served group exhibited the increased levels of 
dopamine (5700±1.84ng/g) when compared to control groups (4300±3.17ng/g). The 
extract at both the doses displayed a significant reduction in postural flexion, 
moderate decrease in tremor, muscular rigidity and postural immobility scores 
but do not exhibit significant lowering of hypokinesia score in reserpine 
induced Parkinsonian model. The reduction in catatonia and catalepsy scores is 
more remarkable in case of high dose of extract (500mg/kg) compared to standard 
drug in Neuroleptic induced Parkinsonism.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that Tabebuia impetiginosa bark extract has 
significant anti-cataleptic potentials and the antioxidant effect of the bark 
may also be a significant contributor to its antiparkinsonian activity.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the top 5 
causes of mortality in the world and can develop as a consequence of genetic 
and/or environmental factors. Current efforts are focused on identifying early 
life insults and how these contribute to COPD development. In line with this, 
our study focuses on the influence of early life nicotine exposure and its 
potential impact on (a) lung pulmonary functions, and (b) elastase-induced 
emphysema in adulthood.
METHODS: To address this hypothesis, we developed a model of 2 hits, delivered 
at different time points: mouse pups were first exposed to nicotine/placebo in 
utero and during lactation, and then subsequently received elastase/placebo at 
the age of 11 weeks. The effect of nicotine pretreatment and elastase 
instillation was assessed by (a) measurement of pulmonary function at 
post-elastase day (ped) 21, and (b) transcriptomic profiling at ped3 and 21, and 
complementary protein determination. Statistical significance was determined by 
3- and 2-way ANOVA for pulmonary functions, and RNAseq results were analyzed 
using the R project.
RESULTS: We did not observe any impact of nicotine pre- and early post-natal 
exposure compared to control samples on lung pulmonary functions in adulthood, 
as measured by FLEXIVENT technology. After elastase instillation, substantial 
lung damage was detected by x-ray tomography and was accompanied by loss in body 
weight at ped3 as well as an increase in cell numbers, inflammatory markers in 
BAL and lung volume at ped21. Lung functions showed a decrease in elastance and 
an increase in deep inflation volume and pressure volume (pv) loop area in 
animals with emphysema at ped21. Nicotine had no effect on elastance and deep 
inflation volume, but did affect the pv loop area in animals with emphysema at 
ped21. Extensive transcriptomic changes were induced by elastase at ped3 both in 
the nicotine-pretreated and the control samples, with several pathways common to 
both groups, such as for cell cycle, DNA adhesion and DNA damage. Nicotine 
pretreatment affected the number of lymphocytes present in BAL after elastase 
instillation and some of the complement pathway related proteins, arguing for a 
slight modification of the immune response, as well as changes related to 
general body metabolism. The majority of elastase-induced transcriptomic changes 
detected at ped3 had disappeared at ped21. In addition, transcriptomic profiling 
singled out a common gene pool that was independently activated by nicotine and 
elastase.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a broad spectrum of transient transcriptomic 
changes in mouse emphysema and identifies nicotine as influencing the 
emphysema-associated immune system response.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of age-associated diseases, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is increasing as the average life 
expectancy increases around the world. We previously identified a gene signature 
for ageing in the human lung which included genes involved in apical and tight 
junction assembly, suggesting a role for airway epithelial barrier dysfunction 
with ageing.
AIM: To investigate the association between genes involved in epithelial barrier 
function and age both in silico and in vitro in the airway epithelium.
METHODS: We curated a gene signature of 274 genes for epithelial barrier 
function and tested the association with age in two independent cohorts of 
bronchial brushings from healthy individuals with no respiratory disease, using 
linear regression analysis (FDR < 0.05). Protein-protein interactions were 
identified using STRING©. The barrier function of primary bronchial epithelial 
cells at air-liquid interface and CRISPR-Cas9-induced knock-down of target genes 
in human bronchial 16HBE14o-cells was assessed using Trans epithelial resistance 
(TER) measurement and Electric cell-surface impedance sensing (ECIS) 
respectively.
RESULTS: In bronchial brushings, we found 55 genes involved in barrier function 
to be significantly associated with age (FDR < 0.05). EPCAM was most 
significantly associated with increasing age and TRPV4 with decreasing age. 
Protein interaction analysis identified CDH1, that was negatively associated 
with higher age, as potential key regulator of age-related epithelial barrier 
function changes. In vitro, barrier function was lower in bronchial epithelial 
cells from subjects > 45 years of age and significantly reduced in 
CDH1-deficient 16HBE14o-cells.
CONCLUSION: The significant association between genes involved in epithelial 
barrier function and age, supported by functional studies in vitro, suggest a 
role for epithelial barrier dysfunction in age-related airway disease.

Sickle cell disease (SCD), which affects approximately 100,000 individuals in 
the USA and more than 3 million worldwide, is caused by mutations in the βb 
globin gene that result in sickle hemoglobin production. Sickle hemoglobin 
polymerization leads to red blood cell sickling, chronic hemolysis and 
vaso-occlusion. Acute and chronic pain as well as end-organ damage occur 
throughout the lifespan of individuals living with SCD resulting in significant 
disease morbidity and a median life expectancy of 43 years in the USA. In this 
review, we discuss advances in the diagnosis and management of four major 
complications: acute and chronic pain, cardiopulmonary disease, central nervous 
system disease and kidney disease. We also discuss advances in disease-modifying 
and curative therapeutic options for SCD. The recent availability of 
L-glutamine, crizanlizumab and voxelotor provides an alternative or supplement 
to hydroxyurea, which remains the mainstay for disease-modifying therapy. 
Five-year event-free and overall survival rates remain high for individuals with 
SCD undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using matched 
sibling donors. However, newer approaches to graft-versus-host (GVHD) 
prophylaxis and the incorporation of post-transplant cyclophosphamide have 
improved engraftment rates, reduced GVHD and have allowed for alternative donors 
for individuals without an HLA-matched sibling. Despite progress in the field, 
additional longitudinal studies, clinical trials as well as dissemination and 
implementation studies are needed to optimize outcomes in SCD.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal malignancies, and therefore, new 
strategies, which aim at the improvement of the prognosis of this lethal 
disease, are needed. Many clinical trials have failed to improve overall 
survival. Nowadays, research is focused on advances provided by novel potential 
targets to efficiently enhance life expectancy. Cannabinoids, the active 
components of Cannabis sativa L., and their derivatives, have been reported as 
palliative adjuvants to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens. Cannabinoid 
effects are known to be mediated through the activation of cannabinoid 
receptors. To date, two cannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2, 
have been cloned and identified from mammalian tissues. Cannabinoids exert a 
remarkable antitumoral effect on pancreatic cancer cells, due to their ability 
to selectively induce apoptosis of these cells. This review strengthens the 
perception that cannabinoid receptors might be useful in clinical testing to 
prognose and treat pancreatic cancer. Many studies have tried to describe the 
mechanism of cell death induced by cannabinoids. The aim of this review is to 
discuss the effects of cannabinoid receptors in pancreatic cancer in order to 
provide a brief insight into cannabinoids and their receptors as pancreatic 
cancer biomarkers and in therapeutic strategies.

Europe's population is ageing. Statutory retirement ages are commonly raised to 
account for continuous increases in life expectancy. In order to estimate the 
potential to increase statutory and consequently effective retirement ages 
further, in this study, we investigate the relationship between partial working 
life expectancy (WLE) and three health expectancies that represent health 
aspects important for work ability and employability between ages 50 and 59 as 
well as 60 and 69 for women and men in Europe. We also explore the association 
between these four indicators and the highest level of educational attainment. 
We apply Sullivan's method to estimate WLE and three selected measures that 
capture general, physical, and cognitive health status of older adults for 26 
European countries since 2004. Over time, WLEs increased significantly in the 
younger age group for women and in the older age group for both sexes. The 
expected number of years in good physical health have continuously been higher 
than any of the other three indicators, while the expected number of years in 
good cognitive health have shown a noticeable increase over time. The 
investigation of the relationship between education and each life expectancy 
confirms the well-established positive correlation between education and 
economic activity as well as good health. Our results indicate potential to 
extend working lives beyond current levels. However, significant differences in 
the expected number of years in good health between persons with different 
levels of education require policies that account for this heterogeneity.

PURPOSE: Glioma patients face a limited life expectancy and at the same time, 
they suffer from afflicting symptoms and undesired effects of tumor treatment. 
Apart from bone marrow suppression, standard chemotherapy with temozolomide 
causes nausea, emesis and loss of appetite. In this pilot study, we investigated 
how chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) affects the patients' levels 
of depression and their quality of life.
METHODS: In this prospective observational multicentre study (n = 87), nausea, 
emesis and loss of appetite were evaluated with an expanded MASCC questionnaire, 
covering 10 days during the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy. Quality 
of life was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN 20 questionnaire and levels 
of depression with the PHQ-9 inventory before and after the first and second 
cycle of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: CINV affected a minor part of patients. If present, it reached its 
maximum at day 3 and decreased to baseline level not before day 8. Levels of 
depression increased significantly after the first cycle of chemotherapy, but 
decreased during the further course of treatment. Patients with higher levels of 
depression were more severely affected by CINV and showed a lower quality of 
life through all time-points.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that symptoms of depression should be perceived in 
advance and treated in order to avoid more severe side effects of tumor 
treatment. Additionally, in affected patients, delayed nausea was most 
prominent, pointing toward an activation of the NK1 receptor. We conclude that 
long acting antiemetics are necessary totreat temozolomide-induced nausea.

Cereals play an important role in global food security. Data from the UN Food 
and Agriculture Organization projects increased consumption of cereals from 2.6 
billion tonnes in 2017 to approximately 2.9 billion tonnes by 2027. However, 
cereals are prone to contamination by toxigenic fungi, which lead to 
mycotoxicosis. The current methods for mycotoxin control involve the use of 
chemical preservatives. However, there are concerns about the use of chemicals 
in food preservation due to their effects on the health, nutritional quality, 
and organoleptic properties of food. Therefore, alternative methods are needed 
that are affordable and simple to use. The fermentation technique is based on 
the use of microorganisms mainly to impart desirable sensory properties and 
shelf-life extension. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally regarded as 
safe (GRAS) due to their long history of application in food fermentation 
systems and ability to produce antimicrobial compounds (hydroxyl fatty acids, 
organic acids, phenyllactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and carbon 
dioxide) with a broad range of antifungal activity. Hence, LAB can inhibit the 
growth of mycotoxin-producing fungi, thereby preventing the production of 
mycotoxins. Fermentation is also an efficient technique for improving nutrient 
bioavailability and other functional properties of cereal-based products. This 
review seeks to provide evidence of the potential of LAB from African fermented 
cereal-based products as potential biological agents against mycotoxin-producing 
fungi.

Advances in HIV care over the last 30 years have transformed a virtually fatal 
condition into a chronic, manageable one. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
dramatically changed the outlook for people living with HIV so that most 
individuals with well controlled disease have a normal life expectancy. As 
result of this increase in life expectancy, one-third of women living with HIV 
are of menopausal age. Adding to the shift in age distribution, rates of new HIV 
diagnosis are increasing in the over 50-year age group, likely the result of a 
combination of low condom use and perception of transmission risk and in women, 
an increased risk of HIV acquisition due to the mucosal disruption that 
accompanies vaginal atrophy. Many women living with HIV are unprepared for 
menopause, have a high prevalence of somatic, urogenital and psychological 
symptomatology and low rates of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use. Many women 
experience enormous frustration shuttling between their general practitioner and 
HIV care provider trying to have their needs met, as few HIV physicians have 
training in menopause medicine and primary care physicians are wary of managing 
women living with HIV, in part, because of fears about potential drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs) between MHT and ART. Several data gaps exist with regard to 
the relationship between HIV and the menopause, including whether the risk of 
HIV transmission is increased in virally-suppressed women with vaginal atrophy, 
whether or not menopause amplifies the effects of HIV on cardiovascular, 
psychological and bone health, as well as the safety and efficacy of MHT in 
women living with HIV. Menopausal women living with HIV deserve high quality 
individualised menopause care that is tailored to their needs. More research is 
needed in the field of HIV and menopause, primarily on cardiovascular disease 
and bone health outcomes as well as symptom control, and strategies to reduce 
HIV acquisition, encourage testing, and maintain older women in care in order to 
inform optimal clinical management.

BACKGROUND: Acute hepatic porphyria includes four inherited disorders caused by 
partial deficiencies of enzymes related to the heme biosynthesis. Clinical 
manifestations include acute attacks, occurring mainly among female patients. 
This study describes the diversity of acute symptoms, changes in triggering 
factors and life expectancy among female patients during the past five decades.
METHODS: 107 Finnish female patients were enrolled into a retrospective, 
longitudinal study during 2015. Clinical, biochemical and genetic data was 
obtained from the medical reports, registry data and a questionnaire designed 
for the study. Causes of death were studied in additional 32 female patients.
RESULTS: Of the 43 patients with hospitalization, 33% had non-complicated, 35% 
prolonged and 28% severe attacks with no correlation with the disease-causing 
mutation. Of the deceased patients, 31% died of an acute attack during 
1957-1979. Thereafter the incidence and severity of acute attacks have decreased 
substantially. 55% of the subjects reported acute symptoms (dysautonomia and 
mental symptoms) without hospitalization, 29% had porphyria symptoms >10 times, 
and 23% within the last year. Despite 22% of the female patients had died of 
primary liver cancer, the life expectancy increased more than 10 years during 
the follow-up, and did not differ from the normal population at present.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of acute attacks requiring hospitalization has 
decreased, but more than half of the female patients reported acute symptoms 
affecting their well-being. Symptoms are currently triggered by hormonal changes 
and weight loss emphasizing the importance of early recognition and active 
management to avoid disease exacerbation. Death due to primary liver cancer is 
common and should be screened regularly.

The rising burden of Alzheimer's disease mortality in rural America.

Ho JY(1), Franco Y(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Southern California, United States.

Since the 1990s, there has been a striking urban-rural divergence in life 
expectancy within the United States, with metropolitan areas achieving strong 
life expectancy increases and nonmetropolitan areas experiencing stagnation or 
actual declines in life expectancy. While Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) are likely to pose a particular challenge in nonmetropolitan 
areas, we know relatively little about the level of ADRD mortality in 
nonmetropolitan areas, how it has changed over time, and whether it is 
contributing to metropolitan/nonmetropolitan life expectancy gaps. This study 
finds that ADRD mortality has risen more rapidly in nonmetropolitan areas than 
in all other metro areas (large central metros, suburbs, and medium/small 
cities) between 1999 and 2019. While death rates from ADRD were nearly identical 
in large central metros and nonmetros in 1999, a clear metro/nonmetro gradient 
has emerged and widened substantially over the past two decades. Today, 
nonmetros now experience the highest levels of ADRD mortality, while large 
central metros have the lowest levels. These metro/nonmetro gaps in ADRD differ 
substantially by region, with the largest gaps observed in the Middle Atlantic 
and South Atlantic. The contribution of ADRD to metro/nonmetro differences life 
expectancy at age 65 is now considerable in many regions, reaching up to 30% for 
women and 13% for men. In several regions, ADRD's contribution to female life 
expectancy gaps is on par with or exceeds the contributions of other leading 
causes of death such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory 
diseases. The rising burden of Alzheimer's disease mortality is likely to pose a 
substantial challenge in rural areas of the United States which are aging 
rapidly, experiencing adverse mortality trends, and increasingly disadvantaged 
in terms of socioeconomic resources and health care infrastructure.
