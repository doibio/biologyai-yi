BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Germany. 
Although several randomized trials in Europe have evaluated the effectiveness of 
lung cancer screening programs, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of lung 
cancer screening is scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a population-based lung cancer 
screening program from the perspective of a German payer.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the public payer 
perspective for a high-risk population defined as heavy former and current 
smokers (≥20 cigarettes per day) between 55 and 75 years of age. The underlying 
model consisted of two Markov models. We differentiated between a 
population-based annual screening program and standard clinical care. Depending 
on stage at diagnosis, simulated patients were assigned to one of five treatment 
paths according to the German clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment 
of lung cancer. Costs, life years saved, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were used as outcomes. Values for input parameters were taken from the 
literature. The model was run for 60 cycles with a cycle length of three months. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base case, annual lung cancer screening led to an increase in 
incremental costs (€ 1,153 per person) compared to standard clinical care. 
However, the screening approach was associated with an incremental gain in life 
years (0.06 per person) and QALYs (0.04 per person). Thus, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was € 19,302 per life year saved and € 30,291 
per QALY. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 draws resulted in 
average ICERs of € 22,118 per life year and € 34,841 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that lung cancer screening for a high-risk 
population may be more effective, but also more costly, than standard clinical 
care from the perspective of a German payer.

OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) 
screening for lung cancer is uncertain. This study estimated the health gains, 
costs (net health system, and including 'unrelated') and cost-effectiveness of 
biennial LDCT screening among 55-74 years olds with a smoking history of at 
least 30 pack years, and (if a former smoker) having quit within last 15 years, 
in New Zealand.
METHODS: We used a macrosimulation stage shift model with New Zealand-specific 
lung cancer incidence rates and intervention parameters from the National Lung 
Screening Trial, a health system perspective, and a lifetime horizon for 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 3% per annum. We 
also examined heterogeneity by gender, ethnicity (Māori (indigenous population) 
versus non-Māori), age and current versus ex-smoking status.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We estimated 0.037 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) 0.024-0.053) per eligible participant, at a cost of US$3606 
($2689-4681). The overall incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
US$104,000 per QALY gained (95% UI US$59,000-US$175,000). The cost-effectiveness 
varied moderately by socio-demographics, with the 'best' ICER being US$52,000 
for 70-74 year old Māori females and the 'worst' ICER being US$142,000 for 55-59 
year old non-Māori females. The ICER varied little by current smoking status, 
due to higher competing mortality risk limiting QALY gains for current smokers. 
The two scenarios that lowered the ICER the most were increasing the screening 
uptake to 100% (ICER = US$50,000 per QALY), and improving the sensitivity (from 
93.8%-98%) and specificity (from 73.4%-95%) of the screening test 
(ICER = US$42,000 per QALY). Based on a threshold of GDP per capita per QALY 
gained (i.e. US$30,000), LDCT screening for lung cancer is unlikely to be 
cost-effective in New Zealand for any sociodemographic group.

BACKGROUND: Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has dramatically shifted therapeutic 
perspectives for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed 
cost-effectiveness of anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab compared to 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: We retrieved survival, progression, and safety data comparing 
first-line pembrolizumab to platinum-doublets for advanced NSCLC patients with 
PD-L1 expression ≥50%, non-mutated EGFR, and non-translocated ALK, from 
KEYNOTE-024. Published United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) costs informed 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Our analysis was based on a 
Bayesian Markov model of disease with full lifetime horizon. We estimated costs 
in USD and summarized effectiveness as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Patients treated with pembrolizumab accumulated 1.80 QALYs (95% CrI 
1.56-1.89), for moderate dependency between outcomes, compared to 1.06 QALYs 
(0.94-1.13) with chemotherapy. From a British National Health System (NHS) 
perspective, the ICER was $52k ($43k-$69k) per end-of-life (EoL) adjusted QALY 
gained, above the 42k USD threshold, while from a US cost perspective, the ICER 
was $49k ($40k-67k) per EoL adjusted QALY, below the hypothetical 100k USD 
threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests first-line pembrolizumab for NSCLC may be 
cost-effective in the US but not the UK, in spite of very similar ICER values in 
both countries.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program 
(EFNEP) affects the quality of life (QoL) of its low-income adult participants.
METHODS: A cross-sectional exploratory study using focus groups (n = 15) in 8 
states with EFNEP participants (n = 111) 2-4 months after graduation. Focus 
groups were conducted with non-Hispanic white (4 groups), black (4), 
English-speaking Hispanic (4), and Spanish-speaking Hispanic (3) respondents. A 
priori template analysis based on constructs from the University of Toronto's 
Quality of Life Profile for Adults and constant comparative procedures were used 
to generate results.
RESULTS: Participants reported following healthier dietary and physical activity 
behaviors and having increased motivation to improve themselves and greater 
satisfaction with life. All groups noted being a more positive influence on 
their families and a having willingness to learn and try new things.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The EFNEP enhances the QoL of its participants, 
which suggests that the program's benefits go beyond participants' documented 
nutrition and health-related behavior changes. In the future, EFNEP might 
examine whether improved QoL is also a predictor of sustained behavior change 
and a means for differentiating program impacts owing to variations in dose 
(number of contacts) or delivery methods (face-to-face vs online).

INTRODUCTION: Unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) may be the first 
manifestation of an undiagnosed cancer. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
18F-Fluorodesoxyglucose Positron Emission/Computed Tomography (FDG PET/CT) plus 
limited screening and limited screening strategies in patients with unprovoked 
VTE from the perspectives of the Ontario (Canada) and French health care 
systems.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a published 
randomized controlled trial of 394 patients aged 18 years or older who were 
diagnosed with unprovoked VTE. We obtained data with respect to efficacy and 
health care utilization from the published trial. The primary measure of 
effectiveness was the number of avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and 
the secondary measure of effectiveness was the quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
at the end of the study in each group. We used generalized linear models to 
estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) while controlling for 
patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results were presented as the 
incremental cost to avoid one case of delayed cancer diagnosis and the 
incremental cost per QALY gained. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
estimated using bootstrap re-sampling procedures with 5000 iterations.
RESULTS: Compared to a limited screening strategy, the ICER of limited strategy 
plus FDG PET/CT scan was C$ 26,840.19 (95% CI: C$ 24,046.51; C$ 34,581.53) per 
one avoided case of delayed cancer diagnosis from the Ontario health system 
perspective and €16,370.45 (95% CI: € 9904.48; € 39,578.91) per one avoided case 
of delayed cancer diagnosis from the French health system perspective. The 
probabilities that addition of FDG PET/CT to limited screening is cost-effective 
rose with increasing willingness to pay values. Compared with the limited 
screening, the extensive screening was associated with C$ 3412.85 per QALY 
gained (95% CI: 1463.89; -13,935.88) from the Ontario health system perspective 
and €2162.83 per QALY gained (95% CI 958.78; -10,544.42) from the French health 
system perspective.
CONCLUSION: Addition of a FDG PET/CT for occult cancer diagnosis was associated 
with better health outcomes (fewer cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and greater 
QALYs) and a higher cost from the perspective of publicly funded health care 
systems; the cost-effectiveness results are however highly uncertain.

Novel Targets in Pancreatic Cancer Therapy - Current Status and Ongoing 
Translational Efforts.

Bisht S, Feldmann G.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, pancreatic cancer) carries one of the 
poorest overall prognoses of all human malignancies known to date. Despite the 
introduction of novel therapeutic regimens, the outcome has not markedly 
improved over the past decades, the incidence rates are almost identical to the 
mortality rates, and PDAC is projected to soon become the second most common 
cause of cancer-related mortality in Western countries. Despite this clear 
medical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies against this dire malady, 
this need has so far not been addressed with sufficient institutional attention 
and support in terms of research funding and strategical programs. Given the 
still growing life expectancy and projected demographic changes with a growing 
proportion of senior citizens in many European societies, this discrepancy is 
likely to become even more pressing in the future. This article provides a brief 
overview of ongoing preclinical efforts to identify novel targets and, based on 
this, to develop novel strategies to treat advanced pancreatic cancer and 
improve survival and the quality of life of patients suffering from this 
malignancy.

PURPOSE: Necrotizing fasciitis of the craniofacial region is a rare and 
potentially life-threatening bacterial infectious disease. Odontogenic 
infections primarily spread along facial fascia and subcutaneous tissues, 
resulting in upper chest skin or thoracic necrosis. The purpose of this clinical 
classification was to demonstrate clinically important guidelines for early 
diagnosis and prompt management of CNF.
METHODS: Although the incidence of cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) is very 
rare in many developed countries, prompt management with appropriate initial 
diagnosis is essential, especially in tropical low-economic rural regions of 
African countries. Over the last 12 years, our charitable team in West Africa 
made clinical classifications of CNF according to onset time and spreading 
pattern to thoracic extension.
RESULTS: CNF patients could be divided into two primary types, limited to neck 
type and extended to upper chest type. We also further categorized from each 
type into three different groups according to the CNF onset and clinical 
characteristics, including acute type with hematogenous spread within 2 weeks, 
subacute type with suppuration over 2 to 4 weeks, chronic type without 
suppuration over 4 weeks, multiple type with partial skin necrosis, island type 
with necrotic skin coverage, and broad type with whole skin necrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These classifications will help decrease the mortality rate in 
severely infected patients.

There is growing interest in pharmacological interventions directly targeting 
the aging process. Pharmacological interventions against aging should be 
efficacious when started in adults and, ideally, repurpose existing drugs. We 
show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved by targeting multiple, 
evolutionarily conserved aging pathways and mechanisms using drug combinations. 
Using this approach in C. elegans, we were able to slow aging and significantly 
extend healthy lifespan. To identify the mechanism of these drug synergies, we 
applied transcriptomics and lipidomics analysis. We found that drug interactions 
involved the TGF-β pathway and recruited genes related with IGF signaling. 
daf-2, daf-7, and sbp-1 interact upstream of changes in lipid metabolism, 
resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acid content and this is required 
for healthy lifespan extension. These data suggest that combinations of drugs 
targeting distinct subsets of the aging gene regulatory network can be leveraged 
to cause synergistic lifespan benefits.

BACKGROUND: The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L instrument is the most widely used quality of 
life (QoL) measure in health economic evaluations. It is unclear whether such a 
generic instrument is valid enough to estimate the benefits of breast 
reconstruction (BR), given the specific changes observed in QoL after BR. Hence, 
we aimed to evaluate the validity of the EQ-5D-5L in patients who had undergone 
postmastectomy BR.
METHODS: In a 10-year cross-sectional cohort study, 463 mastectomy patients 
completed an online survey: 202 patients with autologous-BR (A-BR), 103 with 
implant-based-BR (I-BR), and 158 without BR (MAS). The results were used to 
evaluate the psychometric performance of the EQ-5D-5L with respect to the 
ceiling effect and to known-group, convergent, and discriminant validity, by 
comparing it with the Breast-Q, the cancer-specific (EORTC-QLQ-C30), and breast 
cancer-specific (EORTC-QLQ-BR23) questionnaires.
RESULTS: The EQ-5D-5L was able to discriminate between patients with and without 
complications, MAS with or without BR and MAS versus the general population. It 
was, however, not able to discriminate between A-BR vs. I-BR as well as BR vs. 
general population. It is not clear whether this was due to the insensitivity of 
the instrument, insufficient sample sizes, or because there were no actual 
differences in QoL between these groups. Good convergent and discriminant 
validity of both the EQ-5D-5L and its individual dimensions were demonstrated. 
Additional support for the instrument's validity was revealed by moderate 
correlations between the generic EQ-5D-5L and specific QoL aspects of BR such as 
sexuality and body image.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the validity of the EQ-5D-5L as 
an outcome measure in health economic evaluations of BR.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pregnancy in HoFH females is associated with further 
elevation of already markedly elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) levels, particularly if lipid-lowering therapy is discontinued, placing 
the mother and fetus at increased cardiovascular risk. Lipoprotein apheresis is 
the current recommended treatment for pregnant HoFH patients. However, this is 
costly, time consuming, and is not available in many countries. Alternative 
treatment strategies to control hypercholesterolaemia during pregnancy in HoFH 
patients are necessary.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of 39 pregnancies from a cohort 
of 20 genotypically confirmed female HoFH patients.
RESULTS: No maternal cardiac complications or deaths occurred during the 
pregnancies or during the first year postpartum. Twenty five pregnancies were 
exposed to lipid-lowering therapy, of which 18 were exposed to statin therapy, 
just prior to or during the pregnancy. Thirty three (84%) pregnancies carried to 
term, 3 (8%) premature deliveries and 3 (8%) miscarriages were observed. 
Complications associated with pregnancy in these HoFH patients, did not differ 
from those reported during pregnancies of otherwise healthy woman.
CONCLUSIONS: HoFH is a severe disease impacting significantly on life 
expectancy. However, for many females with HoFH, despite the high cardiovascular 
risk, pregnancy is not uncommon. In resource poor settings and when LA is not 
available, lipid lowering therapy, particularly statin therapy during pregnancy, 
appears to be safe for both mother and fetus and is an acceptable alternative 
for LDL-C reduction in these high risk patients.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to (1) determine the effects of age, period, 
and cohort on mortality rate trends between 1958 and 2012 in Japan and (2) 
assess gender differences in projected life expectancy (LE) for the 2023-2047 
period.
METHODS: A time trend study was conducted using age-period-cohort (APC) 
analysis. A Bayesian APC model was fitted to describe mortality rate trends for 
the 1958-2012 period and to project mortality rates for 2023-2047. LE was 
predicted by Chiang's method using projected mortality rates.
RESULTS: Age, period, and cohort effects showed similar patterns between males 
and females. As time passes, gender differences in projected LE were larger 
among individuals over 65 years than among those under 65 years. Time series 
change rates of the extension of projected LE after excluding specific causes of 
death showed the following: smaller extension of projected LE in males in terms 
of mortality risk from malignant neoplasms, heart diseases, pneumonia, and 
accidents (under 65 years) and in females in terms of mortality risk from heart 
diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and suicide (over 65 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in projected LE are expected to be smaller 
before middle age and to be larger among seniors. These projected gender 
differences stem in part from the lower mortality risk among men than among 
women from malignant neoplasms, heart diseases, pneumonia, and accidents (under 
65 years), and among women compared to men from heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, and suicide (over 65 years).

Septoplasty versus non-surgical management for nasal obstruction due to a 
deviated nasal septum in adults: A modelling study of cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to demonstrate how decision-analytic 
modelling can help to determine circumstances under which surgery may become 
cost-effective, using septoplasty as an example.
DESIGN: We developed a decision-analytic model comparing septoplasty to 
non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum. 
Based on the estimated cost difference between both treatments, we calculated 
the minimal (a) gain in quality-adjusted life-years, or (b) reduction in 
productivity losses needed for septoplasty to be cost-effective. Input was 
derived from literature and publicly available data sources. The time horizon of 
our model was one year, and the willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted 
life-year was €20 000, in accordance with current guidelines.
RESULTS: The cost difference between septoplasty and non-surgical management for 
nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum was €2227 per patient from a 
healthcare perspective (including direct healthcare costs) and €3288 per patient 
from an extended perspective (additionally including travel expenses and 
productivity losses due to poor health). In comparison with non-surgical 
management, septoplasty needed to gain 0.11 to 0.16 QALYs or save 13 sick days 
for nasal obstruction. The longer septoplasty's effect lasts, the more time it 
will have to compensate its extra costs.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the known cost difference between treatments 
can be used as the starting point to determine beneficial effects needed for 
cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions. The effect required by septoplasty 
from a healthcare perspective seems potentially achievable, meaning that it 
would be useful to perform an RCT assessing the actual benefits of septoplasty.

Loss-of-function mutations of progranulin are associated with frontotemporal 
dementia in humans, and its deficiency in mice is a model for this disease but 
with normal life expectancy and mild cognitive decline on aging. The present 
study shows that aging progranulin deficient mice develop progressive polydipsia 
and polyuria under standard housing conditions starting at middle age (6-9 
months). They showed high water licking behavior and doubling of the normal 
daily drinking volume, associated with increased daily urine output and a 
decrease of urine osmolality, all maintained during water restriction. 
Creatinine clearance, urine urea, urine albumin and glucose were normal. Hence, 
there were no signs of osmotic diuresis or overt renal disease, other than a 
concentrating defect. In line, the kidney morphology and histology revealed a 
50% increase of the kidney weight, kidney enlargement, mild infiltrations of the 
medulla with pro-inflammatory cells, widening of tubules but no overt signs of a 
glomerular or tubular pathology. Plasma vasopressin levels were on average about 
3-fold higher than normal levels, suggesting that the water loss resulted from 
unresponsiveness of the collecting tubules towards vasopressin, and indeed 
aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in collecting tubules was diminished, whereas 
renal and hypothalamic vasopressin were increased, the latter in spite of 
substantial astrogliosis in the hypothalamus. The data suggest that progranulin 
deficiency causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in mice during aging. Possibly, 
polydipsia in affected patients - eventually interpreted as psychogenic 
polydipsia - may point to a similar concentrating defect.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the drug prescriptions of nursing home (NH) residents 
during the 6 months prior to their death, and the impact of the recognition of « 
life expectancy lower than 6 months » by the NH staff on the prescriptions.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: 175 nursing homes in France.
PARTICIPANTS: 6275 residents were included from May to June 2011.
MEASUREMENTS: The initial drug prescriptions of the residents who deceased 
within 6 months were compared with those who did not decease. Among the 
residents deceased within 6 months, the drug prescriptions were compared between 
the residents who were «considered at the end of their life» and those who were 
not. Potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIP) were analyzed using Laroche 
criteria and a list of therapies considered as inappropriate at the end of life.
RESULTS: 498 residents (7.9%) died within 6 months after their inclusion: they 
had significantly more therapies (8.3 ± 3.8 vs. 7.9 ± 3.5, p=0.048) than 
non-deceased people. Sixty-one of the residents deceased within 6 months were 
considered by the NH staff as «end of life residents » (12.2%). They received 
significantly less drugs (6.4 ± 4.2 vs 8.5 ± 3.6, p<0.001) than NH's residents 
not identified at the end of their life. They had a more frequent prescription 
of opioids (p<0.001), and less antipsychotics (p<0.001), lipid-lowering drugs 
(p=0.006), or antihypertensive therapies (p<0.01). They also received 
significantly less PIP (59.0% received at least one inappropriate prescription, 
vs. 87.2%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: An important proportion of nursing home residents received PIP. The 
quality of prescriptions in patients identified at the end of their life seems 
to improve, but more than half still receive inappropriate drugs. Special 
attention in prescribing should be given to these patients presenting a high 
risk of adverse events.

Improving the Validity of Mathematical Models for HIV Elimination by 
Incorporating Empirical Estimates of Progression Through the HIV Treatment 
Cascade.

BACKGROUND: Optimism regarding prospects for eliminating HIV by expanding 
antiretroviral treatment has been emboldened in part by projections from several 
mathematical modeling studies. Drawing from a detailed empirical assessment of 
rates of progression through the entire HIV care cascade, we quantify for the 
first time the extent to which models may overestimate health benefits from 
policy changes when they fail to incorporate a realistic understanding of the 
cascade.
SETTING: Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
METHODS: We estimated rates of progression through stages of the HIV treatment 
cascade using data from a longitudinal population-based HIV surveillance system 
in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Incorporating empirical estimates in a mathematical 
model of HIV progression, infection transmission, and care, we estimated life 
expectancy and secondary infections averted under a range of treatment scale-up 
scenarios reflecting expanding treatment eligibility thresholds. We compared the 
results with those implied by the conventional assumptions that have been 
commonly adopted by existing models.
RESULTS: Survival gains from expanding the treatment eligibility threshold from 
CD4 350-500 cells/μL and from 500 cells/μL to treating everyone irrespective of 
their CD4 count may be overestimated by 3.60 and 3.79 times in models that fail 
to capture realities of the care cascade. HIV infections averted from raising 
the threshold from CD4 200 to 350, 350 to 500, and 500 cells/μL to treating 
everyone may be overestimated by 1.10, 2.65, and 1.18 times, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Models using conventional assumptions about cascade progression may 
substantially overestimate health benefits. As implementation of treatment 
scale-up proceeds, it is important to assess the effects of required scale-up 
efforts in a way that incorporates empirical realities of how people move 
through the HIV cascade.

Neurologic Complications of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.

Saylor D.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to 
near-normal life expectancy in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection. However, neurologic complications of HIV remain common; can affect 
any part of the neuraxis; and are due to direct effects of the virus, 
immunosuppression because of untreated HIV infection, aberrant immune responses 
in the setting of ART initiation, and ART toxicities.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains one of 
the most common neurologic complications of HIV encountered today, but milder 
forms predominate in people on ART. No specific treatments for HAND exist, but 
small trials and epidemiologic evidence suggest paroxetine, intranasal insulin, 
and maraviroc may have utility in its treatment; further trials of these agents 
are ongoing. Widespread ART use has decreased the incidence of central nervous 
system opportunistic infections, but prognosis often remains poor in those who 
develop opportunistic infections. High-titer positive serum cryptococcal antigen 
is strongly predictive of cryptococcal meningitis and provides a tool to enhance 
diagnosis in areas with limited resources. HIV is an independent risk factor for 
stroke, and accelerated aging associated with HIV infection results in 
neurologic diseases of older age occurring at much younger ages in individuals 
infected with HIV. Ongoing HIV replication in the CSF despite peripheral 
virologic suppression may contribute to the development of HAND and may not 
improve despite adjusting the ART regimen to increase central nervous system 
penetrance.
SUMMARY: Neurologists are likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in 
clinical practice. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and 
management of the most common neurologic conditions associated with HIV 
infection and ART.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of Descemet's membrane endothelial 
keratoplasty (DMEK) compared with Descemet's stripping automated endothelial 
keratoplasty (DSAEK) in the United States.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a surgical center in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Binocular adult patient undergoing endothelial keratoplasty.
METHODS: A base case of a 70-year-old man undergoing his first endothelial 
keratoplasty for bilateral Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. The cost-effectiveness 
of DMEK was compared with DSAEK over a 15-year time horizon. The incidences and 
costs of complications were derived from PubMed English literature searches, 
Medicare reimbursements, and average wholesale prices. All costs were discounted 
3% per annum and adjusted for inflation to 2018 U.S. dollars. Uncertainty was 
evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental 
cost-utility ratios, measured in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Performing a DMEK instead of a DSAEK generated an extra 0.4 QALYs over 
a 15-year period. From a societal and third-party payer perspective, DMEK was 
cost-saving when compared with DSAEK in improving visual acuity in the base 
case. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses with variations in the costs and 
rebubble rates revealed that DMEK was cost-saving compared with DSAEK in 38% of 
iterations and was within a societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 in 
98% of models.
CONCLUSIONS: From the societal and third-party payer perspectives in the United 
States, DMEK generated greater utilities and was less costly than DSAEK. 
Therefore, DMEK was the dominant procedure and was cost-saving with respect to 
DSAEK. The economic model was robust based on sensitivity analyses.

In Arthropoda, the ovary is classified into Chelicerata-type and 
Mandibulata-type, based on the oocyte-growth position within the ovary. By 
contrast, oocytes of Diplopoda and Chilopoda grow within the hemocoelic space. 
However, as the position of oocyte-growth in Symphyla and Pauropoda has not been 
confirmed, whether the hemocoelic nature of oocyte-growth is common among 
myriapods remains ambiguous. This study described the ovarian structure of 
Hanseniella caldaria to reveal the oocyte-growth position in Symphyla. The 
oocyte is surrounded by the follicle epithelium, and the inner surface of the 
follicle epithelium, i.e., the space between follicle cells and oocytes, is 
lined with a basement membrane. The follicle epithelial layer continues to the 
ovarian epithelium via the follicle extension with a continuous layer of 
basement membrane. Data on the architecture of the follicle suggest that the 
follicle pouch opens to the hemocoel. Hence, the oocyte of H. caldaria grows 
within the hemocoelic space. Based on our findings in H. caldaria and previous 
studies in a millipede and in centipedes, the hemocoelic nature of oocyte-growth 
is considered as a common feature among myriapods and a synapomorphy of the 
Myriapoda for which morphological synapomorphies have been ambiguous.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a significant risk factor for hospitalization 
and shortened life expectancy. Therefore, developing new serum biomarkers for 
early diagnosis and prognosis of COPD associated PH is crucial. In the present 
study, a solid-phase antibody array simultaneously detecting multiple proteins 
was used to search specific COPD associated PH biomarkers, with COPD patients 
and healthy subjects as control groups. As a result, compared to the COPD and 
healthy groups, the levels of MCP-4, SDF-1 alpha, CCL28, Adipsin, IL-28A, CD40 
and AgRP were uniquely altered in COPD patient serum with pulmonary 
hypertension. Among these proteins, CCL28, MCP-4, CD40, AgRP and IL-28A were 
identified to be differentially expressed in COPD patients with hypertension, 
indicating that these cytokines may serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis 
and prognosis of COPD associated pulmonary hypertension.

Multiple studies in India have found elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in target 
populations. However the data have not yet been evaluated to understand 
population-wide exposure levels. We used arithmetic mean blood lead data 
published from 2010 to 2018 on Indian populations to calculate the average BLLs 
for multiple subgroups. We then calculated the attributable disease burden in IQ 
decrement and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Our Pubmed search yielded 
1066 articles. Of these, 31 studies representing the BLLs of 5472 people in 9 
states met our study criteria. Evaluating these, we found a mean BLL of 
6.86 μg/dL (95% CI: 4.38-9.35) in children and 7.52 μg/dL (95% CI: 5.28-9.76) in 
non-occupationally exposed adults. We calculated that these exposures resulted 
in 4.9 million DALYs (95% CI: 3.9-5.6) in the states we evaluated. 
Population-wide BLLs in India remain elevated despite regulatory action to 
eliminate leaded petrol, the most significant historical source. The estimated 
attributable disease burden is larger than previously calculated, particularly 
with regard to associated intellectual disability outcomes in children. Larger 
population-wide BLL studies are required to inform future calculations. Policy 
responses need to be developed to mitigate the worst exposures.
