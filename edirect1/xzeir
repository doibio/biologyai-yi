Gelatin-sodium alginate-based active packaging films were formulated by 
including date pits extracts (DPE), as bioactive compound, in raw minced beef 
meat packaging. The DPE effects at 0.37, 0.75 and 1.5% (w/w, DPE/ gelatin-sodium 
alginate) on physical, optical, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of 
established films were assessed. Findings showed that film lightness decreased 
with the incorporation of DPE. Physical, antioxidant and anti-food-borne 
pathogens capacities were enhanced by increasing DPE concentration in the films. 
For 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), the films with 
1.5% DPE had the greatest levels (94 and 88%, respectively). DPE films (1.5%) 
also exhibited the highest anti-Listeria moncytogenes activity, with an 
inhibition zone of 25 mm. Moreover, during 14 days at 4 °C, the bio-preservative 
impact of gelatin-sodium alginate film impregnated with DPE at three levels on 
microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of meat beef samples was 
evaluated. By the end of the storage, DPE at 1.5% enhanced the instrumental 
color, delayed chemical oxidation and improved sensory traits. By chemometric 
techniques (principal component analysis (PCA) and heat maps), all data allowed 
to obtain helpful information by segregating all the samples at each storage 
time. PCA and heat maps could connect oxidative chemical changes, instrumental 
color parameters, and microbiological properties to sensory attributes. These 
data offer an approach to well interpreting the sensory quality and how they are 
affected by chemical and microbiological changes in the studied meat samples. 
Our findings indicated the potential of the gelatin-sodium alginate film 
incorporated with DPE for enhancing meat safety and quality.

Neurodegenerative disease (ND) incidence has recently increased due to improved 
life expectancy. Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most 
prevalent NDs. Both diseases are poly genetic, multifactorial and heterogenous. 
Preventive medicine, a healthy diet, exercise, and controlling comorbidities may 
delay the onset. After the diseases are diagnosed, therapy is needed to slow 
progression. Recent studies show that local, peripheral and age-related 
inflammation accelerates NDs' onset and progression. Patients with autoimmune 
disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could be at higher risk of 
developing AD or PD. However, no increase in ND incidence has been reported if 
the patients are adequately diagnosed and treated. Autoantibodies against 
abnormal tau, β amyloid and α- synuclein have been encountered in AD and PD and 
may be protective. This discovery led to the proposal of immune-based therapies 
for AD and PD involving monoclonal antibodies, immunization/ vaccines, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibition and anti-inflammatory cytokine addition. 
All the different approaches have been analysed here. Future perspectives on new 
therapeutic strategies for both disorders are concisely examined.

Healthcare, Aylesbury, UK.

BACKGROUND: Long-term survival after spinal cord injury (SCI) has been 
extensively studied in the US and UK.
OBJECTIVE: To compare SCI epidemiology and survival results between the US and 
UK for the same time period and patient groups.
METHODS: We restricted attention to persons injured at ages 18 and older who had 
survived at least 2 years post injury and were not ventilator dependent. We 
performed survival analysis using logistic regression on person-year data with 
time-dependent covariates. The resulting mortality rates were used to construct 
life tables in order to obtain life expectancies.
RESULTS: The average age at injury, percentage male, and level/grade of injury 
were rather similar between the two countries. After adjustment for risk 
factors, UK mortality was 85% of that in the US (95% c.i. 80%, to 91%, p < 
 0.0001). Mortality increased by 0.3% per year over the 1980 to 2012 study 
period (HR = 1.003); this was not statistically significant (p = 0.44). The US 
and UK life expectancies are nearly the same percentage of their respective 
general population values, differing by at most 2% .
CONCLUSION: Long-term mortality after SCI in the UK is roughly 15% lower than 
that in the US. The general population mortality in the UK is also approximately 
15% lower, however, and thus the percentages of normal life expectancy in the 
two countries prove to be strikingly similar.

Taihu Lake has officially implemented the full fishing ban policy since October 
1, 2020. We investigated fish community of Taihu Lake in the four seasons of 
2020. A total of 42 fish species were collected, belonging to 6 orders, 7 
families, and 33 genera. The first five dominant species ranked by the index of 
relative importance were Coilia nasus, Toxabramis swinhonis, Hypophthalmichthys 
molitrix, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and Salangichthys tangkahkeii. The number 
of C. nasus accounted for 85.1% of the total number of catches. According to the 
distributional characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic plants, 
Taihu Lake could be divided into the northern, central, and eastern regions. 
There was no significant difference in catch per unit effort (CPUE) among 
different lake regions, but Shannon diversity index and Pielou evenness index in 
the eastern region was greater than in the other two regions. The CPUE, Shannon 
diversity index, and Pielou evenness index were significantly different among 
the four seasons, with the lowest CPUE in autumn and higher diversity in autumn 
and winter than in spring and summer. Electrical conductivity, water depth, 
chloride, and transparency were the main environmental factors driving the 
seasonal variations of fish community in Taihu Lake, while electrical 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, and transparency were key 
variables driving the spatial patterns. The results could be used as the 
baseline data for fish community studies in Taihu Lake after the fishing ban.

BACKGROUND: Paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by human consumption of 
shellfish fed on toxic algae is a public health hazard. It is imperative to 
implement shellfish monitoring programs to minimize the possibility of shellfish 
contaminated by paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) reaching the marketplace.
RESULTS: A rapid detection method for PST in mussels using near-infrared 
spectroscopy (NIRS) technology has been proposed. The spectral data in the 
wavelength range of 950-1700 nm for PST-contaminated and non-contaminated mussel 
samples have been used for building the detection model. To solve the imbalanced 
classification problem that the quantity of non-contaminated mussels is far less 
than that of PST-contaminated mussels in practical application, near-bayesian 
support vector machines (NBSVM) with unequal misclassification costs (u-NBSVM) 
have been applied. The u-NBSVM model performs competitively on imbalanced 
datasets by combining unequal misclassification costs and decision boundary 
shifts. The detection performance of the u-NBSVM does not show worse with the 
number of PST samples decreasing by adjusting the misclassification costs. When 
the number of PST samples is 20, the G-mean and accuracy can reach 0.9898 and 
0.9944, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the traditional SVM and the NBSVM, the u-NBSVM model 
achieves better detection performance. The results of this study validate that 
the NIRS technology combined with the u-NBSVM model can be used for rapid and 
non-destructive PST detection in mussels. This article is protected by

Author information:

BACKGROUND: With rapidly rising life expectancy and ageing populations, interest 
has grown in the survival patterns and ages at death at the highest ages. In 
Scandinavia, the accumulation of very old population segments coupled with 
long-established, high-quality population registers permit meaningful analysis.
METHODS: This study is based on individual level data from extinct Norwegian 
birth cohorts using data obtained from the Norwegian Civil Register System. We 
assess trends in the ages at death of centenarians in Norway for cohorts born 
between 1870 and 1904 for evidence of any secular increase using quantile 
regression.
RESULTS: We observed that there is no upward trend in centenarian lifespans, in 
line with recent observations in Sweden, but contrary to the upward trend at the 
very highest percentiles as observed in Denmark.
CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that the stagnation in centenarian 
lifespans may be partly due to the failure to find ways of dealing with 
neurodegenerative diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanical stress of 
sandwich vertebrae (SVs) and common adjacent vertebrae in different degrees of 
spinal mobility in daily life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A finite element model of the spinal segment of T10-L2 
was developed and validated. Simultaneously, T11 and L1 fractures were 
simulated, and a 6-ml bone cement was constructed in their center. Under the 
condition of applying a 500-N axial load to the upper surface of T10 and 
immobilizing the lower surface of L2, moments were applied to the upper surface 
of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2 and divided into five groups: M-T10, M-T11, M-T12, 
M-L1, and M-L2. The maximum von Mises stress of T10, T12, and L2 in different 
groups was calculated and analyzed.
RESULTS: The maximum von Mises stress of T10 in the M-T10 group was 30.68 MPa, 
36.13 MPa, 34.27 MPa, 33.43 MPa, 26.86 MPa, and 27.70 MPa greater than the 
maximum stress value of T10 in the other groups in six directions of load 
flexion, extension, left and right lateral bending, and left and right rotation, 
respectively. The T12 stress value in the M-T12 group was 29.62 MPa, 32.63 MPa, 
30.03 MPa, 31.25 MPa, 26.38 MPa, and 26.25 MPa greater than the T12 stress value 
in the other groups in six directions. The maximum stress of L2 in M-T12 in the 
M-L2 group was 25.48 MPa, 36.38 MPa, 31.99 MPa, 31.07 MPa, 30.36 MPa, and 32.07 
MPa, which was greater than the stress value of L2 in the other groups. When the 
load is on which vertebral body, it is subjected to the greatest stress.
CONCLUSION: We found that SVs did not always experience the highest stress. The 
most stressed vertebrae vary with the degree of curvature of the spine. Patients 
should be encouraged to avoid the same spinal curvature posture for a long time 
in life and work or to wear a spinal brace for protection after surgery, which 
can avoid long-term overload on a specific spine and disrupt its blood supply, 
resulting in more severe loss of spinal quality and increasing the possibility 
of fractures.

Introduction: Exercise is beneficial for increasing areal bone mineral density 
(aBMD) in adolescence and maintaining it in old age. Moreover, high-impact 
sports are more effective than low-impact sports in increasing aBMD. This study 
aimed to determine the types of adolescent sports played in school-based sports 
clubs associated with aBMD in old age. Methods: In total, 1,596 older adults 
(681 men and 915 women, age: 65-84 years) living in an urban area of Japan were 
evaluated for the femoral neck and lumbar spine aBMD using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry. The association between adolescent sports played in sports clubs 
and aBMD in old age was analyzed using multiple regression analysis, with 
femoral neck and lumbar spine aBMD as dependent variables, and sports type and 
participant characteristics such as age, body weight, and serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level, as independent variables. Results: For the 
femoral neck, basketball was associated with aBMD in older men (β = 0.079, p < 
0.05) and women (β = 0.08, p < 0.01), whereas current body weight and 25(OH)D 
level were associated with aBMD in both sexes. For the lumbar spine, volleyball 
(β = 0.08, p < 0.01) and swimming (β = 0.06, p < 0.05) was significantly 
associated with lumbar spine aBMD, whereas current body weight, 25(OH)D, and 
diabetes mellitus were associated with aBMD in older women. Conclusion: Both men 
and women who played basketball in adolescence had higher femoral neck aBMD in 
old age. Moreover, women who played volleyball in adolescence had higher lumbar 
spine aBMD in old age.

Sport, the arts, and fans' loyalty: the role of color for sport fans.

Schleifer R(1), Tamir I(1).

Author information:
(1)Moskowitz School of Communication, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.

Sport fandom has attracted far-ranging research attention. Fans' commitment, 
loyalty, and sense of affinity are abundantly expressed in a long list of life 
practices. Precisely in this context, the color that identifies each sports team 
has also become an important element of the game but also a crucial component of 
fans' identities. The present article focuses on the esthetics of team uniform 
colors and identifies the artistic roles they fill. Among other things, the 
article addresses the important role of color, for example in identifying and 
distinguishing figures on the pitch from the background by creating clear 
borders between the elements on the pitch that compete for fans' attention; in 
the extension of fans' emotions through the connection between team and color; 
in creating the opportunity for spectators to participate fully in creating the 
esthetic experience on the field through the intensive use of team colors; and 
in enhancing a team's halo effect through the association of the team with its 
colors. On a deeper level, the article states that in an era of commercialized 
sports, the team color remains the clear and consistent symbol of the team that 
preserves the identity of the fans.

Elderly subjects with more than 20 natural teeth have a higher healthy life 
expectancy than those with few or no teeth. The oral microbiome and its 
metabolome are associated with oral health, and they are also associated with 
systemic health via the oral-gut axis. Here, we analyzed the oral and gut 
microbiome and metabolome profiles of elderly subjects with more than 26 natural 
teeth. Salivary samples collected as mouth-rinsed water and fecal samples were 
obtained from 22 healthy individuals, 10 elderly individuals with more than 26 
natural teeth and 24 subjects with periodontal disease. The oral microbiome and 
metabolome profiles of elderly individuals resembled those of subjects with 
periodontal disease, with the metabolome showing a more substantial differential 
abundance of components. Despite the distinct oral metabolome profiles, there 
was no differential abundance of components in the gut microbiome and 
metabolomes, except for enrichment of short-chain fatty acids in elderly 
subjects. Finally, to investigate the relationship between the oral and gut 
microbiome and metabolome, we analyzed bacterial coexistence in the oral cavity 
and gut and analyzed the correlation of metabolite levels between the oral 
cavity and gut. However, there were few associations between oral and gut for 
bacteria and metabolites in either elderly or healthy subjects. Overall, these 
results indicate distinct oral microbiome and metabolome profiles, as well as 
the lack of an oral-gut axis in elderly subjects with a high number of natural 
teeth.

The role of staging in multiple myeloma.

Yavorkovsky LL(1).

Author information:
(1)Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center, Oncology Division, 271 
International Circle, San Jose, CA, USA.

INTRODUCTION: The importance of cancer staging is determined by how accurately 
it can predict prognosis, and how useful it is for treatment decisions. Compared 
to other malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) staging proved more challenging 
because of unreliable prognostic factors and wide-ranging life expectancy. As 
traditional MM staging continues to evolve, it requires reassessment of its 
prognostic and predictive value.
AREAS COVERED: The studies that included prognostic and predictive value of MM 
stages from 1975 through 2023 were selected for this review using PubMed, 
MEDLINE platforms. The history and evolution of MM staging are revisited, 
including its role in predicting survival, treatment planning and potential 
practical implications for the future. The role of MM staging for oncological 
practice and patient counseling is discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: The utility of the traditional MM staging remains unsatisfactory 
because it lacks a strong connection with the disease biology, prognosis or 
treatment planning. Additionally, it demonstrates a modest value for patient 
counseling because individual prognosis is subject to under- or overestimation, 
and the median survival or survival rates are difficult concepts to grasp. 
Although the role of MM stages may change in the future, the current research 
upholds the notion that MM staging benefits more medical research and clinical 
trials than oncological practice.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer causes a substantial burden to our society, both from a 
health and an economic perspective. To improve cancer patient outcomes and lower 
society expenses, early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential. The recent 
COVID-19 crisis has disrupted the care trajectory of cancer patients, which may 
affect their prognosis in a potentially negative way. The purpose of this paper 
is to present a flexible decision-analytic Markov model methodology allowing the 
evaluation of the impact of delayed cancer care caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 
in Belgium which can be used by researchers to respond to diverse research 
questions in a variety of disruptive events, contexts and settings.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed for 4 selected cancer 
types (i.e. breast, colorectal, lung, and head and neck), comparing the 
estimated costs and quality-adjusted life year losses between the pre-COVID-19 
situation and the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium. Input parameters were derived 
from published studies (transition probabilities, utilities and indirect costs) 
and administrative databases (epidemiological data and direct medical costs). 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are proposed to consider 
uncertainty in the input parameters and to assess the robustness of the model's 
results. Scenario analyses are suggested to evaluate methodological and 
structural assumptions.
DISCUSSION: The results that such decision-analytic Markov model can provide are 
of interest to decision makers because they help them to effectively allocate 
resources to improve the health outcomes of cancer patients and to reduce the 
costs of care for both patients and healthcare systems. Our study provides 
insights into methodological aspects of conducting a health economic evaluation 
of cancer care and COVID-19 including insights on cancer type selection, the 
elaboration of a Markov model, data inputs and analysis.

BACKGROUND: Understanding comorbidity and its burden characteristics is 
essential for policymakers and healthcare providers to allocate resources 
accordingly. However, several definitions of comorbidity burden can be found in 
the literature. The main reason for these differences lies in the available 
information about the analyzed diseases (i.e., the target population studied), 
how to define the burden of diseases, and how to aggregate the occurrence of the 
detected health conditions.
METHODS: In this manuscript, we focus on data from the Italian surveillance 
system PASSI, proposing an index of comorbidity burden based on the disability 
weights from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project. We then analyzed the 
co-presence of ten non-communicable diseases, weighting their burden thanks to 
the GBD disability weights extracted by a multi-step procedure. The first step 
selects a set of GBD weights for each disease detected in PASSI using text 
mining. The second step utilizes an additional variable from PASSI (i.e., the 
perceived health variable) to associate a single disability weight for each 
disease detected in PASSI. Finally, the disability weights are combined to form 
the comorbidity burden index using three approaches common in the literature.
RESULTS: The comorbidity index (i.e., combined disability weights) proposed 
allows an exploration of the magnitude of the comorbidity burden in several 
Italian sub-populations characterized by different socioeconomic 
characteristics. Thanks to that, we noted that the level of comorbidity burden 
is greater in the sub-population characterized by low educational qualifications 
and economic difficulties than in the rich sub-population characterized by a 
high level of education. In addition, we found no substantial differences in 
terms of predictive values of comorbidity burden adopting different approaches 
in combining the disability weights (i.e., additive, maximum, and multiplicative 
approaches), making the Italian comorbidity index proposed quite robust and 
general.

INTRODUCTION: As the life expectancy of children with congenital heart disease 
(CHD) is rapidly increasing and the adult population with CHD is growing, there 
is an unmet need to improve clinical workflow and efficiency of analysis. 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a noninvasive imaging modality for 
monitoring patients with CHD. CMR exam is based on multiple breath-hold 
2-dimensional (2D) cine acquisitions that should be precisely prescribed and is 
expert and institution dependent. Moreover, 2D cine images have relatively thick 
slices, which does not allow for isotropic delineation of ventricular 
structures. Thus, development of an isotropic 3D cine acquisition and automatic 
segmentation method is worthwhile to make CMR workflow straightforward and 
efficient, as the present work aims to establish.
METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with many types of CHD were imaged using a 
non-angulated 3D cine CMR sequence covering the whole-heart and great vessels. 
Automatic supervised and semi-supervised deep-learning-based methods were 
developed for whole-heart segmentation of 3D cine images to separately delineate 
the cardiac structures, including both atria, both ventricles, aorta, pulmonary 
arteries, and superior and inferior vena cavae. The segmentation results derived 
from the two methods were compared with the manual segmentation in terms of Dice 
score, a degree of overlap agreement, and atrial and ventricular volume 
measurements.
RESULTS: The semi-supervised method resulted in a better overlap agreement with 
the manual segmentation than the supervised method for all 8 structures (Dice 
score 83.23 ± 16.76% vs. 77.98 ± 19.64%; P-value ≤0.001). The mean difference 
error in atrial and ventricular volumetric measurements between manual 
segmentation and semi-supervised method was lower (bias ≤ 5.2 ml) than the 
supervised method (bias ≤ 10.1 ml).
DISCUSSION: The proposed semi-supervised method is capable of cardiac 
segmentation and chamber volume quantification in a CHD population with wide 
anatomical variability. It accurately delineates the heart chambers and great 
vessels and can be used to accurately calculate ventricular and atrial volumes 
throughout the cardiac cycle. Such a segmentation method can reduce inter- and 
intra- observer variability and make CMR exams more standardized and efficient.

BACKGROUND: Health cognitive promotion and protection is a critical topic. With 
the world's aging population and rising life expectancy, there will be many 
people living with highly age-related dementia illnesses. Cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and dementia share the same risk factors, such as unhealthy lifestyles and 
metabolic factors. These recognized risks associated with CVD and dementia 
frequently co-occur. CVD risk models may have a close association with dementia 
and cognitive decline. So, this systematic review aimed to determine whether CVD 
risk models were connected with dementia or cognitive decline and compare the 
predictive ability of various models.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, 
Sinomed, and WanFang were searched from 1 January 2014 until 16 February 2023. 
Only CVD risk models were included. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for 
the quality assessment of included cohort studies and the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (AHRQ) for cross-sectional studies. The Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement's guidelines 
were followed in this systematic study.
RESULTS: In all, 9,718 references were screened, of which 22 articles were 
included. A total of 15 CVD risk models were summarized. Except for the 
Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) health index, 
the other 14 CVD risk models were associated with dementia and cognitive 
decline. In comparison, different CVD risk models and domain-specific cognitive 
function correlation variation depended on cohort characteristics, risk models, 
cognitive function tests, and study designs. Moreover, it needed to be clarified 
when comparing the predicting performance of different CVD risk models.
CONCLUSION: It is significant for public health to improve disease risk 
prediction and prevention and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the 
heart on the brain. More cohort studies are warranted to prove the correlation 
between CVD risk models and cognitive function. Moreover, further studies are 
encouraged to compare the efficacy of CVD risk models in predicting cognitive 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Online treatments are increasing in number and are currently 
available for a wide range of clinical problems. To date little is known about 
the role of treatment expectations and other placebo-like mechanisms in online 
settings compared to traditional face-to-face treatment. To address this 
knowledge gap, we analyzed individual participant data from randomized clinical 
trials that compared online and face-to-face psychological interventions.
METHODS: MEDLINE (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) were last searched on 2 February 
2021. Randomized clinical trials of therapist guided online v. face-to-face 
psychological interventions for psychiatric or somatic conditions using a 
randomized controlled design were included. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of 
studies were independently screened by multiple observers. The Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. 
Authors of the matching trials were contacted for individual participant data. 
Ratings from the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire and the primary 
outcome measure from each trial were used to estimate the association between 
expectation ratings and treatment outcomes in online v. face-to-face 
interventions, using a mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: Of 7045 screened studies, 62 full-text articles were retrieved whereof 
six studies fulfilled the criteria and provided individual participant data (n = 
491). Overall, CEQ ratings predicted clinical outcomes (β = 0.27) at end of 
treatment with no moderating effect of treatment modality (online v. 
face-to-face).
CONCLUSIONS: Online treatment appears to be equally susceptible to expectancy 
effects as face-to-face therapy. This furthers our understanding of the 
importance of placebo-like factors in online treatment and may aid the 
improvement of healthcare in online settings.

BACKGROUND: The mSToPS study (mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes) reported 
screening older Americans at risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke using 
2-week patch monitors was associated with increased rates of AF diagnosis and 
anticoagulant prescription within 1 year and improved clinical outcomes at 3 
years relative to matched controls. Cost-effectiveness of this AF screening 
approach has not been explored.
METHODS: We conducted a US-based health economic analysis of AF screening using 
patient-level data from mSToPS. Clinical outcomes, resource use, and costs were 
obtained through 3 years using claims data. Individual costs, survival, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were projected over a lifetime horizon using 
regression modeling, US life tables, and external data where needed. Adjustment 
between groups was performed using propensity score bin bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Screening participants (mean age, 74 years, 41% female, median 
CHA2DS2-VASC score 3) wore on average 1.7 two-week monitors at a mean cost of 
$614/person. Over 3 years, outpatient visits were more frequent for monitored 
than unmonitored individuals (difference 190 per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 
82-298]), but emergency department visits (-8.3 [95% CI, -12.6 to -4.1]) and 
hospitalizations (-15.2 [CI, -22 to -8.6]) were less frequent. Total adjusted 
3-year costs were slightly higher (mean difference, $1551 [95% CI, -$1047 to 
$4038]) in the monitoring group. In patient-level projections, the monitoring 
group had slightly greater quality-adjusted survival (8.81 versus 8.71 QALYs, 
difference, 0.09 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.24]) and slightly higher lifetime costs, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36 100/QALY gained. 
With bootstrap resampling, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
monitoring was <$50 000/QALY in 64% of study replicates, and <$150 000/QALY in 
91%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using lifetime projections derived from the mSToPS study, we found 
that AF screening using 2-week patch monitors in older Americans was associated 
with high economic value. Confirmation of these uncertain findings in a 
randomized trial is warranted.

Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene 
therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with sickle-cell 
disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which 
respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of 
experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene 
therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of 
eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could 
offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime 
cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity 
and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and 
one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of 
children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were 
generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher 
expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than 
parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. 
When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to 
consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance 
increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with 
mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major 
driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder 
symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms 
deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk 
balance of this novel technology.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy (LE) of people with HIV (PWH) and 
describe causes of death.
DESIGN: ART-naïve adults from the CoRIS cohort starting ART in 2004-2019.
METHODS: We calculated LE at age 40 for men and women according to their ART 
initiation period, and stratified by transmission category, CD4 count and AIDS 
diagnosis.We estimated LE in 10-year age bands using life tables constructed 
from mortality rates, estimated through Poisson models.
RESULTS: LE increased from 65.8 (95%CI: 65.0-66.6) in 2004-2008 to 72.9 
(72.2-73.7) in 2014-2019 in men (general population comparators [GPC]:79.1 and 
81.2 years, respectively) and from 65.8 (65.0-66.6) to 72.5 (71.8-73.3) in women 
(GPC: 84.9 and 86.4, respectively). Non-AIDS-related deaths accounted for 68% of 
deaths among men and 78% among women. LE was longer when starting ART with 
higher CD4 counts and without AIDS. For men acquiring HIV through sex with men, 
starting ART in 2014-2019 without AIDS, LE was 75.0 (74.2-75.7) with 
CD4<200 cells/μL, rising to 78.1 (77.5-78.8) with CD4≥350 cells/μL. 
Corresponding figures were 70.1 (69.4-70.9) and 76.0 (75.3-76.7) for men 
acquiring HIV heterosexually (HTX) and 61.5 (60.7-62.3) and 69.0 (68.2-69.8) for 
those acquiring HIV through injection drug use (IDU). For women starting ART 
from 2014 without AIDS, LE increased from 71.7 (71.0-72.4) to 77.3 (76.7-77.9) 
among HTX and from 63.7 (62.9-64.5) to 70.7 (70.0-71.5) among IDU.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the progressive improvement of LE in PWH in 
Spain over the last decades, supporting the insurability of PWH on suppressive 
ART in our current setting and time.
