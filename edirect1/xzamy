loss due to ischaemic optical neuropathy. The primary response of the retinal 
arteries to systemic arterial hypertension is vascular narrowing and the 
manifestations that appear at the back of the eye in hypertensive retinopathy 
are diffuse or focal vasoconstriction, extravasation due to increased vascular 
permeability and arteriosclerosis with swelling of the wall of the vessels. 
These three entities are responsible for the appearance of different lesions 
that characterise the stages of the retinal disease, which are: arteriovenous 
crossings, hard and cotton-like exudates, thrombosis, embolisms, haemorrhages in 
the retinal parenchyma, vitreous detachment from the retina, papilla edema and 
ischaemic optical neuropathy in the more severe cases, such as in case malign 
arterial hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is an acquired leucoderma whose etiology remains unknown. 
Its frequency in the world is estimated at 1%.
AIM: The purpose of our study is to asses, with through a retrospective hospital 
series, the epidemilogic, clinical, therapeutic and course of this dermatosis 
and to compare our results with those of the literature.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients attending the 
outpatient dermatological department at Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis over a 
5 year-period (from June 1999 to July 2000).
RESULTS: 503 patients were reviewed during a 5-year period. They were 288 women 
and 215 men (sex-ratio F/H = 1.33). The average age was 28.2 years (extremes of 
3 and 80 years). The peak of frequency was located in the 2nd decade of the life 
(26%). A family history of vitiligo was found in 27% of the cases. The average 
time of consultation was 21 months. The localization of the lesions was 
ubiquitary prevalent at the uncovered areas. An association with other 
pathological conditions was found in 23% of cases. Most patients were treated by 
a photochemotherapy (78.2%). Photoprotection was advised among all patients. The 
course was specified in 112 cases corresponding to a partial (28.9%) or a 
complete repigmentation (0, 8%), a stabilization of lesions (41.6%) and an 
extension (26%).
CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the literature stressing the 
frequency of vitiligo which can cause an aesthetic and psychological damage of 
variable and sometimes major importance.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of prognosis in patients with cirrhosis is important so 
as to plan their management as well as the choice of major procedures. The aim 
of the present study was to determine the survival rates and to identify 
indicators associated with shorter life expectancy in Tunisians patients with 
cirrhosis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with cirrhosis admitted 
during 14-years period. We studied clinical and biochemical characteristics of 
all patients and the occurrence of decompensation or complication 
(gastro-intestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, hepato-renal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma). The overall 
survival, mortality rate and causes of death were reviewed. Univariate and 
multivariate analysis was performed on all variables to identify parameters 
associated with a lower life expectancy.
RESULTS: We studied 85 patients (50 females/35 males) with a mean age of 57 
years. Mean follow up was 31 months. The overall survival was 47% at 5 years. 
With univariate analysis, 13 variables were associated with a poor prognosis: 
male sex, jaundice, ascites, and decompensation at admission, increased serum 
gammaglobulin, gammaGT, bilirubine and ASAT levels, Child-Pugh C, occurrence of 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-renal syndrome 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. With multivariate analysis, 2 variables were 
independently correlated with survival:male sex and elevated gammaGT.
CONCLUSION: In our study, male sex, increased serum gammaGT and gammaglobulin 
are uncommon parameters that may predict survival in cirrhotic patient. The 
Child-Pugh score was a good index for assessing the prognosis.

Adalimumab: in plaque psoriasis.

Croom KF(1), McCormack PL.

Author information:
(1)Wolters Kluwer Health/Adis, Auckland, New Zealand.

Adalimumab is a recombinant, human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for tumor 
necrosis factor. The clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab (40 mg 
administered subcutaneously every other week) in patients with 
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis have been demonstrated in several 
randomized, double-blind clinical trials, including the pivotal trials REVEAL (n 
= 1212) and CHAMPION (n = 271). Based on these trials, adalimumab was 
significantly more effective than placebo and methotrexate at relieving the 
signs and symptoms of psoriasis after 16 weeks of treatment, as assessed by the 
percentage of patients achieving a 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index. Based on open-label extension studies of up to 2 years' 
duration, the efficacy of adalimumab was sustained over the long term. Of 
patients who had responded to 33 weeks of treatment with adalimumab in REVEAL, 
patients randomized to remain on adalimumab for an additional 19 weeks of 
treatment were significantly less likely to experience loss of an adequate 
response than patients who were transferred to placebo. Compared with placebo or 
methotrexate, adalimumab was associated with significantly greater improvements 
in dermatology-specific and general measures of health-related quality of life 
in patients with plaque psoriasis. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated in 
trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, and the adverse-event profile was 
similar to that associated with its use in rheumatoid arthritis.

Cause of death in patients with dementia disorders.

Brunnström HR(1), Englund EM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Investigations on cause of death may provide valuable information 
about life expectancy and on conditions of terminal dementia care, which perhaps 
can be ameliorated.
METHODS: The autopsy reports were studied on all patients (n = 524; 55.3% 
females; median age 80 years) with a clinically and neuropathologically 
diagnosed dementia disorder who underwent a complete autopsy at the University 
Hospital in Lund, Sweden, during 1974-2004.
RESULTS: The two most common causes of death were bronchopneumonia (38.4%) and 
ischaemic heart disease (23.1%), whilst neoplastic diseases were uncommon 
(3.8%). In a general population of elderly studied for comparison, 
bronchopneumonia accounted for 2.8%, ischaemic heart disease for 22.0%, and 
neoplasm for 21.3% of the deaths. Amongst the demented patients, circulatory and 
respiratory system diseases were the causes of death in 23.2% and 55.5% of the 
Alzheimer patients, respectively, whilst the corresponding figures were 54.8% 
and 33.1% for the patients with vascular dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dementia, pneumonia as the immediate cause of 
death may reflect a terminal stage in which patient care and feeding is 
difficult to manage well. Knowledge about what actually causes death is of value 
in the terminal care of patients with dementia disorders.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of continuous subcutaneous insulin injection 
versus multiple daily injections in type 1 diabetes patients: a third-party US 
payer perspective.

(1)Medtronic Diabetes, 18000 Devonshire Street Northridge, CA 91325-1219, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections 
(MDI) of insulin in adult and child/young adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
patients from a third-party payer perspective in the United States.
METHOD: A previously validated health economic model was used to determine the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CSII compared with MDI using 
published clinical and cost data. The primary input variable was change in 
HbA(1c), and was assumed to be an improvement of -0.9% to -1.2% for CSII 
compared with MDI for child/young adult and adults, respectively. A series of 
Markov constructs simulated the progression of diabetes-related complications.
RESULTS: CSII was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained of 1.061 versus MDI for adults and 0.799 versus MDI for 
children/young adults. ICERs were $16,992 and $27,195 per QALY gained for CSII 
versus MDI in adults and children/young adults, respectively. Improved glycemic 
control from CSII led to a lower incidence of diabetes complications, with the 
most significant reduction in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), end 
stage renal disease (ESRD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The number 
needed to treat (NNT) for PDR was nine patients, suggesting that only nine 
patients need to be treated with CSII to avoid one case of PDR. The NNT for ESRD 
and PVD was 19 and 41, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Setting the willingness to pay at $50,000/QALY, the analysis 
demonstrated that CSII is a cost-effective option for patients with T1DM in the 
United States.

Childhood urinary tract infections (UTIs) can lead to renal scarring and 
ultimately to terminal renal failure, which has a high impact on quality of 
life, survival, and health-care costs. Variation in the treatment of UTIs 
between practices is high.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a maximum care model for UTIs in 
children, implying more testing and antibiotic treatment, compared with current 
practice in primary care in The Netherlands.
METHODS: We performed a probabilistic modeling study using Markov models. 
Figures used in the model were derived from a systematic review of the research 
literature. Multidimensional Monte Carlo simulation was used for the 
probabilistic analyses.
RESULTS: Maximum care gained 0.00102 (males) and 0.00219 (girls) QALYs 
(quality-adjusted life-years) and saved 42.70 euro (boys) and 77.81 euro (girls) 
in 30 years compared with current care, and was thus dominant. Net monetary 
benefit of maximum care ranged from 20 euro to 200 euro for a willingness to pay 
for a QALY ranging from 0 euro to 80,000 euro, respectively. Maximum care was 
also dominant over improved current care, although less dominant than to current 
care.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that maximum care for childhood UTI was 
dominant in the long run to current care, meaning that it delivered more quality 
of life at lower costs. Nevertheless, making firm conclusions is not possible, 
given the limitations of the input data.

The use of opioids in the treatment of osteoarthritis: when, why, and how?

Goodwin JL(1), Kraemer JJ, Bajwa ZH.

Author information:
(1)goodwinj@ohsu.edu

As life expectancy increases every decade, the incidence and prevalence of 
osteoarthritis (OA) also will increase. Despite progress in our knowledge of the 
pathophysiology of OA, the management of OA-mediated pain continues to challenge 
physicians. Concern regarding the cardiovascular effects of cyclooxygenase-2 
inhibitors and the gastrointestinal and renal side effects of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in general has limited the use of these 
medications in the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Appropriately dosed 
and monitored use of opioids for OA pain, when more conservative methods have 
failed, has potentially fewer life-threatening complications associated with it 
than the more commonly and often less successfully employed pharmacotherapeutic 
approaches to care. When used as part of a multimodal approach to pain control, 
opioids are a safe and effective treatment for joint pain, including that of OA. 
Patients for whom NSAIDs are contraindicated, or for whom combined 
acetaminophen, tramadol, and NSAID therapy is ineffective, may be started on 
low-dose opioids and titrated as needed and tolerated. Patient education and 
informed consent, exercise, complementary medicine, and the use of a controlled 
substance agreement increases the likelihood of patient compliance with 
treatment guidelines, improving functional capacity and quality of life.

Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.

The present study evaluated the use of vacuum packaging (alone) or with addition 
of oregano essential oil (EO), as an antimicrobial treatment for shelf-life 
extension of fresh Mediterranean octopus stored under refrigeration for a period 
of 23 days. Four different treatments were tested: A, control sample; under 
aerobic storage in the absence of oregano essential oil; VP, under vacuum 
packaging in the absence of oregano essential oil; and VO1, VO2, treated samples 
with oregano essential oil 0.2 and 0.4% (v/w), respectively, under VP. Of all 
the microorganisms enumerated, Pseudomonas spp., H2S-producing bacteria and 
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were the groups that prevailed in octopus samples, 
irrespective of antimicrobial treatment. With regard to the chemical freshness 
indices determined, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values were low in all octopus 
samples, as could have been expected from the low fat content of the product. 
Both trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) 
values of oregano treated under VP octopus samples were significantly lower 
compared to control samples during the entire refrigerated storage period. Based 
primarily on sensory evaluation (odor), the use of VP, VO1 and VO2 extended the 
shelf-life of fresh Mediterranean octopus by ca. 3, 11 and 20 days, 
respectively.

The effectiveness of electron beam irradiation and high pressure treatment for 
the sanitation of cold-smoked salmon from two points of view, microbial safety 
and shelf-life extension, was compared. From the response of L. monocytogenes 
INIA H66a to irradiation, a D value of 0.51 kGy was calculated. For samples 
stored at 5 degrees C, 1.5 kGy would be sufficient to attain a Food Safety 
Objective (FSO) of 2 log(10)cfu/g L. monocytogenes for a 35-day shelf-life, 
whereas 3 kGy would be needed in the case of a temperature abuse (5 degrees C + 
8 degrees C). Pressurization at 450 MPa for 5 min was considered to be an 
insufficient treatment, since the FSO of 2 log(10)cfu/g L. monocytogenes was 
only attained for a shelf-life of 21 days at 5 degrees C. However, treatment at 
450 MPa for 10 min achieved this FSO for samples held during 35 days at 5 
degrees C, or during 21 days under temperature abuse (5 degrees C+8 degrees C) 
conditions. Irradiation at 2 kGy kept the microbial population of smoked salmon 
below 6 log(10)cfu/g after 35 days at 5 degrees C, with negligible or very light 
changes in its odor. Pressurization at 450 MPa for 5 min also kept the microbial 
population below 6 log(10)cfu/g after 35 days at 5 degrees C and did not alter 
odor, but affected negatively the visual aspect of smoked salmon.

Columbia, Canada. fylau@uvic.ca

Although there is a growing body of knowledge on survival prediction in 
populations with advanced cancer receiving palliative care using the Palliative 
Performance Scale (PPS), this literature has focused on disease, gender, and 
care location, and less is known about how to apply such knowledge to be 
clinically meaningful. To address this issue, we evaluated a database comprising 
13 years of initial PPS scores on 6066 patients, which were recorded on their 
first assessment by the Victoria Hospice palliative care team in the home or 
palliative care unit setting. Our results reaffirmed PPS as a significant 
predictor of survival, with increasing survival times associated with higher PPS 
levels. We explored survival time distributions, a life expectancy table, and a 
survival nomogram as three potential ways to assist in estimating survival times 
in palliative care. We also evaluated the concept of Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
"nose-tail" refinement, and observed that this approach requires more research. 
More work is needed to better identify those who live "longer than expected" or 
die "sooner than expected" to provide clinical utility in discussion with 
patients and families.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgically induced weight loss 
relative to conventional therapy for the management of recently diagnosed type 2 
diabetes in class I/II obese patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study builds on a within-trial cost-efficacy 
analysis. The analysis compares the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) between the two intervention groups. Intervention costs were 
extrapolated based on observed resource utilization during the trial. The 
proportion of patients in each intervention group with remission of diabetes at 
2 years was the same as that observed in the trial. Health care costs for 
patients with type 2 diabetes and outcome variables required to derive estimates 
of QALYs were sourced from published literature. A health care system 
perspective was adopted. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. 
Costs are presented in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD) (currency exchange: 1 AUD = 
0.74 USD).
RESULTS: The mean number of years in diabetes remission over a lifetime was 11.4 
for surgical therapy patients and 2.1 for conventional therapy patients. Over 
the remainder of their lifetime, surgical and conventional therapy patients 
lived 15.7 and 14.5 discounted QALYs, respectively. The mean discounted lifetime 
costs were 98,900 AUD per surgical therapy patient and 101,400 AUD per 
conventional therapy patient. Relative to conventional therapy, surgically 
induced weight loss was associated with a mean health care saving of 2,400 AUD 
and 1.2 additional QALYs per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgically induced weight loss is a dominant intervention (it both 
saves health care costs and generates health benefits) for managing recently 
diagnosed type 2 diabetes in class I/II obese patients in Australia.

Author information:
(1)University of California Cooperative Extension, Sonora, California, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To study variation in quality of life and quality of care in patients 
with diabetes experiencing three different models of care: traditional hospital 
care, hospital/general practitioner (GP) shared care, and structured GP care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 1,456 patients 
with diabetes (71% response rate) was conducted. Quality of life was assessed 
with the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) instrument and 
quality of care with a 10-point process-of-care report card.
RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a high (upper quartile) ADDQoL score 
was significantly increased in the structured care relative to the traditional 
hospital care group (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.2-2.5]). A significantly higher proportion 
of structured GP care patients reported compliance with seven or more key 
process-of-care measures compared with the other models of care.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes quality of life may be enhanced when care is provided in a 
primary care setting without compromising quality of care.

Hospital, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. purplemind@mac.com

BACKGROUND: Although autogenous arteriovenous fistulae are the optimal route for 
dialysis access, extended polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts continue to be 
the preferred access for patients without suitable superficial veins. Among the 
common complications related to dialysis grafts, thrombosis due to graft outlet 
stenosis is the most frequently encountered clinical problem. A cuffed graft was 
designed to eliminate the outflow turbulence to reduce outlet stenosis and to 
enhance the clinical patency of ePTFE grafts. We conducted a prospective, 
randomized study to compare the clinical outcomes of cuffed ePTFE grafts and 
noncuffed grafts in dialysis access.
METHODS: Between November 2004 and October 2005, 89 ePTFE grafts were implanted 
for hemodialysis access in the upper extremities of end-stage renal patients. 
Graft selection was randomized, with patients receiving a cuffed graft (Venaflo) 
or a regular noncuffed graft (Stretch Gore-Tex). All patients were monitored for 
signs of thrombosis or other complications. Primary and secondary graft patency 
was analyzed by using a life-table analysis, and the log-rank test was applied 
to compare graft patencies.
RESULTS: Demographic data for both groups were similar without statistical 
difference. The primary patency rates and secondary patency rates at 12 months 
after implantation were 56% and 91% for cuffed grafts, and 41% and 78% for 
noncuffed grafts, respectively. The cuffed group outperforms the noncuffed group 
regarding primary and secondary patencies statistically. However, the incidence 
of other complications that required further surgery was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation revealed that the cuffed ePTFE graft, which was 
designed to decrease graft outlet stenosis, may enhance the clinical patency 
rates of dialysis grafts.

The evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents several challenges for 
public health. HIV and resistance to antimycobacterial medications have 
evolutionary implications for how Mycobacterium tuberculosis will evolve, as 
these factors influence the host environment and transmission dynamics of 
tuberculosis strains. We present an evolutionary invasion analysis of 
tuberculosis that characterizes the direction of tuberculosis evolution in the 
context of different natural and human-driven selective pressures, including 
changes in tuberculosis treatment and HIV prevalence. We find that the evolution 
of tuberculosis virulence can be affected by treatment success rates, the 
relative transmissibility of emerging strains, the rate of reactivation from 
latency among hosts, and the life expectancy of hosts. We find that the 
virulence of tuberculosis strains may also increase as a consequence of rising 
HIV prevalence, requiring faster case detection strategies in areas where the 
epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis collide.

span.

Body size of organisms spans 24 orders of magnitude, and metabolic rate and life 
span present comparable differences across species. This article shows that this 
variation can be explained in terms of evolutionary entropy, a statistical 
parameter which characterizes the robustness of a population, and describes the 
uncertainty in the age of the mother of a randomly chosen newborn. We show that 
entropy also has a macroscopic description: It is linearly related to the 
logarithm of the variables body size, metabolic rate, and life span. 
Furthermore, entropy characterizes Darwinian fitness, the efficiency with which 
a population acquires and converts resources into viable offspring. Accordingly, 
entropy predicts the outcome of natural selection in populations subject to 
different classes of ecological constraints. This predictive property, when 
integrated with the macroscopic representation of entropy, is the basis for 
enormous differences in morphometric and life-history parameters across species.

Ageing and mortality in the UK--national statistician's annual article on the 
population.

Dunnell K.

The population of the UK is growing at the fastest rate since the 1960s, 
increasing on average by 0.5 per cent each year. The fastest growing age group 
is those aged 85 years and older, who now represent just over 2 per cent of the 
population, compared to just over 1 per cent in 1982. In 2007, continued 
increase in the population over state pension age meant for the first time this 
sub-group of the population exceeded the number aged under 16. Further 
improvements in survival mean both the continued growth of the older population 
and the likely continued ageing of the population as a whole. This is the second 
in a series of annual reports on the population of the UK, providing an overview 
of the latest statistics on the population, and focussing on a specific theme. 
This year's theme is the ageing population, with different topics to be covered 
in future years. The report highlights the work being taken forward as part of 
the National Statistics Centre for Demography (NSCD) work programme to 
understand the social and demographic impacts of an ageing society.

AIM: To evaluate the use of the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology and 
Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE-II) at admission to predict the development of 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) among very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study included 304 infants screened for ROP from 
July 2004 to October 2007. The main outcomes were the development of any stage 
ROP and severe ROP. The main variable was the SNAPPE-II obtained at admission. 
Seventeen risk factors for ROP were studied by univariate analysis (chi(2) and 
Student's t test). A simple descriptive analysis was used for the SNAPPE-II 
(mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range: p25-p75). Logistic 
regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated for 
SNAPPE-II. Ophthalmological examinations started at the 6th week of life and 
were repeated until the 45th week of corrected gestational age (GA).
RESULTS: The mean GA and mean birth weight of the whole cohort were 30.3 weeks 
(+/-2.2) and 1,209.2 g (+/-277.7), respectively. The median SNAPPE-II among 
non-ROP and ROP patients were 6.0 and 15.0, respectively (p = 0.001). When 
compared with severe ROP patients (25.0) there was also a significant difference 
(p = 0.003). After logistic regression, the SNAPPE-II adjusted odds ratio for 
ROP was 1.024. The area under the ROC curve was 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 
0.55-0.70, p < 0.001). The best discriminative cutoff value was 8.5 
(sensitivity: 68%; specificity: 54%; positive predictive value: 37.3%; negative 
predictive value: 80.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: The SNAPPE-II values at admission were significantly higher among 
babies with ROP, suggesting a positive association between higher scores with 
the development of ROP, but after adjusted logistic regression and ROC curve 
results, the SNAPPE-II scores at admission did not enhance the assessment of 
risk for ROP.

3 patients presented with non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a 50-year-old 
woman who had an adenoma that had not increased in size for 3 years; a 
68-year-old man with an adenoma that was undiagnosed for 5 years and led to 
pituitary insufficiency and bitemporal hemianopsia; and a 64-year-old woman, who 
had refused therapy and follow-up after diagnosis of the adenoma 20 years 
earlier. She was admitted with a hydrocephalus, pituitary insufficiency, and 
severe visual loss. The clinical symptoms of pituitary adenomas are caused by 
the mass effects of the tumour and may vary considerably between patients. 
Transsphenoidal surgery is indicated in cases of suprasellar extension with 
compression or impending compressing of the optic chiasm. A 'wait-and-see' 
approach can be used for patients with smaller tumours and no visual field 
defects. The natural course of these adenomas is such that lifelong follow-up is 
necessary. Postoperative radiotherapy can be effective in reducing recurrence 
rates without negative effects on quality of life.

[Operative neurosurgery: personal view and historical backgrounds. (5) 
Meningioma].

[Article in Japanese]

Yonekawa Y(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Zürich.

The author reports his experience of 410 surgeries of meningiomas on 365 cases 
during the last 13.5 years, including 51 surgeries on recurrent meningiomas and 
8 surgeries with the change of initial approach on the same meningiomas. In the 
surgical management of meningiomas, following comments are to be emphasized: 
Appropriate approach and interruption of blood supply are of cardinal importance 
in surgical management of meningiomas. For the latter purpose, preoperative 
embolization of feeding arteries is recommended especially in deep seated and 
large meningiomas more than 3 cm in diameter for carrying out their surgical 
extirpation fast and radically. Olfactory groove meningiomas, planum sphenoidal 
meningiomas, tuberculum sellae meningiomas and sphenoid ridge meningiomas are 
managed with pterional approach. The latter two meningiomas may necessitate 
selective extradural anterior clinoidectomy SEAC. For the management of large 
midline meningiomas, combination with interhemispheric approach is necessary to 
manage pial supply appropriately for the preservation of circulation of the 
anterior cerebral artery ACA. Extension of the former two meningiomas to the 
other side can be managed with falcal incision and/or drilling out of the crista 
galli without performing a bifrontal approach. Reduction of exophthalmos due to 
sphenoid ridge meningiomas infiltrating Periorbita and extraocular muscles is 
hardly to be expected even after subtotal removal and extensive decompression of 
the orbita at the superior and lateral walls in combination with SEAC. 
Accidental compromise of the lenticulostriate arteries arising from M1 portion 
embraced by tumor nodules should be managed with oxycellulose and fibrin glue at 
first without their bipolar coagulation, as resulting infarction in the 
territory causes persistent hemiparesis. Meningiomas in the cavernous sinus 
should be observed as long as possible in case of no growth, as they remain the 
same in their size and extension mostly for a long time. In case of growth, 
stereotactic radiosurgery is the first choice and at last would come surgical 
intervention at the cost of quality of life QOL. Appropriate approaches for 
meningiomas arising from the incisura tentorii would be either the 
amygdalohippocampectomy AHE approach namely transSylvian transsulcus circularis 
approach for their anterior localization or the supracerebellar transtentorial 
SCTT approach for the posterior localization in the sitting position. In the 
latter following structures are to be preserved with great care: A. 
parietooccipitalis, trochlear nerve, Vena Rosenthal and the superior cerebellar 
artery which could have considerable supply to the tumor. Meningiomas of the 
falcotentorial junction are managed also with this approach but may necessitate 
combination of the suboccipital transtentorial approach large upper clivus 
meningiomas can be removed more effectively by paramedian or lateral 
suboccipital craniotomy via SCTT approach in the sitting position rather than 
the subtemporal transpetrosal approach. Clean and wider operative fields in the 
former approach are emphasized. Special mention is made to transvertebralis 
(dural) ring approach TVRA for the foramen magnum or lower clivus meningiomas, 
in which the vertebral artery can be mobilized without performing more extensive 
far lateral approach. Difficulties of management of recurrent parasagittal 
meningiomas with the location corresponding to the gyrus paracentralis plus 
supplementary motor area are to be emphasized. Role of the venous sinus 
reconstruction is discussed. Difficulties of management of recurrent meningiomas 
represented by atypical or anaplastic meningiomas WHO grade II or III which can 
not be managed only by surgical removal is discussed by presenting some example 
cases. Biological activity of meningiomas in different location can be quite 
different in multiple recurrent meningiomas. Meningiomas intractable to 
irradiation and/or chemotherapy are another challenging topic, being beyond the 
scope of this paper.

Use of auscultation and Doppler echocardiography in Boxer puppies to predict 
development of subaortic or pulmonary stenosis.

Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Boxers are predisposed to subaortic and pulmonic stenosis (SAS, PS). 
Screening of puppies may be useful in estimating the risk of their developing a 
defect that potentially compromises life expectancy or exercise tolerance.
HYPOTHESIS: Presence of SAS or PS in adult Boxers can be predicted by 
auscultation and Doppler echocardiography at 9-10 weeks of age.
ANIMALS: Eighty-five Boxer puppies examined at 9-10 weeks of age and at 12 
months of age.
METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal observational study. Auscultation by 
stethoscope and continuous wave-Doppler echocardiography for peak velocities 
(V(max)) in the aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA).
RESULTS: Intensity of heart murmurs in puppies correlated with V(max)Ao and 
V(max)PA in adults. V(max)Ao and V(max)PA in puppies correlated with V(max)Ao 
and V(max)PA in adults, respectively. From puppy to adult, V(max)Ao increased 
and V(max)PA remained unchanged. The negative predictive value for absent or 
only a soft (< or =II/VI) murmur in puppies being associated with V(max)Ao and 
PA < or = 2.4 m/s as an adult was 90% and < or =3.5 m/s 100%. The negative 
predictive value of a V(max)< or = 2.4 m/s as a puppy still being < or =2.4 m/s 
as an adult was 94% for Ao and 96% for PA, and of a V(max)< or = 3.5 m/s, 99% 
for Ao and 100% for PA.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Even though V(max)Ao increases during 
growth in Boxer puppies, indicating relative narrowing of the aorta, puppies 
with V(max)Ao < or = 2.4 m/s do not usually progress to clinically have relevant 
SAS at 12 months of age.

Inequality in the distribution of adult length of life - defined as age at death 
in the population aged 15 and over - is studied for virtually all countries of 
the world using a new database with over 9000 life tables covering a period of 
up to two centuries. The data reveal huge variation among countries and time 
periods in the degree to which the available years of life are distributed 
equally among the population. Most length of life inequality (about 90%) is 
within-country inequality. Our findings make clear that measures of length of 
life inequality should be adjusted for life expectancy to get a more relevant 
indicator of length of life differentials across populations. At similar levels 
of life expectancy, substantial differences in inequality are observed, even 
among highly developed countries. Expressed as premature mortality, inequality 
may be 35-70% higher in the most unequal countries compared to the most equal 
ones. Countries that reached a certain level of life expectancy earlier in time 
than other countries, and countries that improved their life expectancy more 
quickly than others, experienced higher levels of inequality.

Premature mortality from general medical illnesses among persons with bipolar 
disorder: a review.

School of Medicine, Seattle, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Despite recent evidence that patients with bipolar disorder are at 
increased risk of premature mortality resulting from general medical disorders, 
there has been no systematic review of published studies. The authors reviewed 
the literature to determine whether there is evidence of increased risk of 
mortality from general medical causes among patients with bipolar spectrum 
disorders.
METHODS: MEDLINE was searched from 1959 to 2007 with a focus on bipolar disorder 
and medical mortality. Published studies in English with more than 100 patients 
were included.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified involving 331,000 patients with 
bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, affective disorder severe enough to 
require inpatient psychiatric care or treatment with lithium, or schizoaffective 
disorder (that is, bipolar spectrum disorders) meeting the inclusion criteria. 
Compared with age- and sex-matched control samples without mental illness in the 
general population, mortality ratios for death from natural causes and from 
specific general medical conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, 
cerebrovascular, and endocrine disorders, were significantly higher among 
patients with bipolar spectrum disorders in most studies. This finding was more 
consistent in larger studies with more than 2,500 patients with bipolar spectrum 
disorders. Cumulatively, cardiovascular disorder appeared to be the most 
consistent cause of excess mortality in larger studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that bipolar spectrum disorders are 
associated with increased premature mortality secondary to general medical 
illnesses. Unhealthy lifestyle, biological factors, adverse pharmacologic 
effects, and disparities in health care are possible underlying causes for this 
excess mortality.

The costs and benefits of automatic estimated glomerular filtration rate 
reporting.

Virginia, USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has 
increased over the past two decades. The sensitivity of serum creatinine (sCr) 
to identify CKD is low. As a result, many healthcare centers report estimated 
GFR (eGFR) with routine blood work. The aim of this study was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of automatic eGFR reporting compared with reporting sCr 
alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A Markov model was designed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reporting eGFR compared with reporting sCr 
alone in a hypothetical cohort of 60-yr-old individuals undergoing annual blood 
chemistry testing over 18 yr. Paths and path probabilities were identical 
between the two arms, except for the sensitivity and specificity of eGFR and sCr 
to detect CKD.
RESULTS: eGFR reporting was dominant with a cost/effectiveness ratio of 
$16,751/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) versus $16,779/QALY for sCr reporting. 
Monte Carlo microsimulations in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients 
demonstrated that over 18 yr, an average of 13 fewer deaths, 29 fewer ESRD 
events, and 11,348 more false positive CKD (FP-CKD) cases occurred with eGFR 
reporting. A sensitivity analysis revealed that decreasing the FP-CKD quality of 
life by > 2% rendered sCr reporting more cost-effective than eGFR reporting. If 
FP-CKD reduced quality of life by 5%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for sCr reporting versus eGFR reporting would be $4367/QALY.
CONCLUSION: A decision analysis suggests that reporting eGFR may be beneficial, 
but this limited benefit was reversed with virtually any reduction in quality of 
life caused by incorrect diagnosis of CKD.

Cancer is linked with hypercoagulability and risk of thrombosis and this close 
association was recognized by Armand Trousseau in 1865. The relation between 
cancer and blood coagulation is reciprocal: cancer induces a hypercoagulable 
state and predisposes to thrombosis and activation of platelets, blood 
coagulation and fibrinolysis interfere with tumor cell biology, tumor growth, 
angiogenesis and metastatic process. In the present article, we analyze the 
clinical trials which assessed the influence of anticoagulant treatment on the 
survival of patients with cancer. The available data show that 
low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) tend to be more effective and safer than 
vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in improving survival in patients with cancer. The 
beneficial effect of anticoagulation with either LMWHs or VKA is not universal 
for all patients with cancer. There are some histological types of cancers 
which, at early stages, appear to be more sensitive than others to the effect of 
anticoagulant treatment. The available clinical trials, although limited, are 
encouraging for the beneficial effect of anticoagulant treatment on the survival 
of cancer patients. More clinical trials are needed, targeting groups of 
patients homogenous regarding the type of cancer, the stage of the disease and 
life expectancy. The forthcoming clinical trials have to address some issues 
regarding the optimal dose, the timing and the duration of treatment with LMWH 
in relation to chemotherapy or other anticancer therapies.
