In order to observe the changes of the causes of death among the residents in 
Gansu, mortality and years of porential life lost (YPLL) are used in this 
article to analyse the data of causes of death in 1990-1994. Data indicates that 
the average mortality of residents was 591.98 per 100,000. The main sequence 
were as below: respiratory diseases, cardiorasculor and cerebrovascalar 
diseases, neoplasms, injuries and pediatric diseases. Chronic diseases take up 
74.4% of an mortalities. Average YPLL was 55.84/1000. YPLL sequence was as 
follows: injuries, neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, infectious diseases, 
cardiorascular diseases.

[Analysis on the tendency of practical dust exposure year and the out-of-dust 
rate among coalminers].

[Article in Chinese]

It is important to study the practical dust exposure year and out-of-dust rate 
for the evaluation of dust level and to predict pneumoconiosis incidence in coal 
miners. A Retrospective Cohort Study was carried out on the calculation of 
practical dust exposure year and the out-of-dust rate among coal miners employed 
during 1958-1988 in a mine. The results showed that job variety had a strong 
effect on dust exposure year and that out-of-dust rate beared relationship to 
the years of employment. It can be estimated that the percentage of coalminers 
who were employed in 1975-1979 with dust exposure year reached 20 years would be 
less than 30%, and that those being employed after 1980 would be even lesser.

CONTEXT: The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) published the 
Smoking Cessation: Clinical Practice Guideline in 1996. Based on the results of 
meta-analyses and expert opinion, the guideline identifies efficacious 
interventions for primary care clinicians and smoking cessation specialty 
providers.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of clinical recommendations in 
AHCPR's guideline.
DESIGN: The guideline's 15 recommended smoking cessation interventions were 
analyzed to determine their relative cost-effectiveness. Then, using decision 
probabilities, the interventions were combined into a global model of the 
guideline's overall cost-effectiveness.
PATIENTS: The analysis assumes that primary care clinicians screen all 
presenting adults for smoking status and advise and motivate all smokers to quit 
during the course of a routine office visit or hospitalization. Smoking 
cessation interventions are provided to 75% of US smokers 18 years and older who 
are assumed to be willing to make a quit attempt during a year's time.
INTERVENTION: Three counseling interventions for primary care clinicians and 2 
counseling interventions for smoking cessation specialists were modeled with and 
without transdermal nicotine and nicotine gum.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost (1995 dollars) per life-year or quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) saved, at a discount of 3%.
RESULTS: The guideline would cost $6.3 billion to implement in its first year. 
As a result, society could expect to gain 1.7 million new quitters at an average 
cost of $3779 per quitter, $2587 per life-year saved, and $1915 for every QALY 
saved. Costs per QALY saved ranged from $1108 to $4542, with more intensive 
interventions being more cost-effective. Group intensive cessation counseling 
exhibited the lowest cost per QALY saved, but only 5% of smokers appear willing 
to undertake this type of intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other preventive interventions, smoking cessation is 
extremely cost-effective. The more intensive the intervention, the lower the 
cost per QALY saved, which suggests that greater spending on interventions 
yields more net benefit. While all these clinically delivered interventions seem 
a reasonable societal investment, those involving more intensive counseling and 
the nicotine patch as adjuvant therapy are particularly meritorious.

Is growth hormone bad for your heart? Cardiovascular impact of GH deficiency and 
of acromegaly.

Lombardi G(1), Colao A, Marzullo P, Ferone D, Longobardi S, Esposito V, Merola 
B.

Naples, Italy.

At present, there is growing evidence implicating GH and/or IGF-I in the 
intricate cascade of events connected with the regulation of heart development 
and hypertrophy. Moreover, GH excess and/or deficiency have been shown to 
include in their advanced clinical manifestations almost always an impaired 
cardiac function, which may reduce life expectancy. This finding is related both 
to a primitive impairment of heart structure and function and to metabolic 
changes such as hyperlipidemia, increase of body fat and premature 
atherosclerosis. Patients with childhood or adulthood-onset GH deficiency have a 
reduced left ventricular mass and ejection fraction and the indexes of left 
ventricular systolic function remain markedly depressed during exercise. 
Conversely, in acromegaly the cardiac enlargement, which is disproportionate to 
the increase in size of other internal body organs, has been a rather uniform 
finding. The severity of the acromegalic cardiomyopathy was reported to be 
correlated better with the disease duration than with circulating GH and/or 
IGF-I levels. Myocardial hypertrophy with interstitial fibrosis, 
lymphomononuclear infiltration and areas of monocyte necrosis often results in 
concentric hypertrophy of both ventricles. The treatment of GH deficiency and 
excess improved cardiac function. Interestingly, based on the evidence that GH 
increases cardiac mass, recombinant GH was administered to patients with 
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It increased the myocardial mass and reduced 
the size of the left ventricular chamber, resulting in improvement of 
hemodynamics, myocardial energy metabolism and clinical status. These promising 
results open new perspectives for the use of GH in heart failure.

Long-term follow up of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 
mild, moderate, or severe impairment of left ventricular function.

Trappe HJ(1), Wenzlaff P, Pfitzner P, Fieguth HG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiology and Angiology, University Hospital Herne, Ruhr 
University Bochum, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with life threatening ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias, impaired left ventricular function, and severe heart failure 
will benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatment.
DESIGN: 410 patients were followed up after ICD implant. Left ventricular 
function was assessed by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 
of heart failure: 50 patients (12%) were in NYHA I-II, 151 (37%) in NYHA II, 117 
(29%) in NYHA II-III, and 92 (22%) in NYHA III. Epicardial ICD implantation was 
performed in 209 patients (51%) and 201 patients (49%) received non-thoracotomy 
ICDs.
RESULTS: Perioperatively, 12 patients (3%) died, more often after epicardial ICD 
implant (11/209 patients, 5%) than after transvenous implant (1/201 patients, < 
1%) (P < 0.05). During a mean (SD) follow up of 28 (24) months (range < 1 to 114 
months), 90 patients (23%) died: nine (2%) died from sudden arrhythmia; five 
(1%) also died suddenly but probably not from arrhythmic causes; 55 (14%) died 
from cardiac causes (congestive heart failure, myocardial reinfarction); 21 (5%) 
died from non-cardiac causes. The three year, five year, and seven year survival 
was 92-96% for arrhythmic mortality in NYHA class I, II and III, compared to a 
three year survival of 94% and a five year and seven year survival of 84% for 
patients in NYHA class II-III. 338 patients (82%) received ICD shocks (21 (SD 
43) shocks per patient); patients in NYHA class II (83%), class II-III (84%), 
and class III (90%) received ICD discharges more often than those in class I-II 
(64%) (P < 0.05). The mean (SD) time interval between ICD implant and the first 
ICD shock was shorter in NYHA class II (16 (17) months), class II-III (19 (27) 
months), and class III (16 (19) months) than in class 0-I (22 (24) months) (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild, moderate, and severe left ventricular 
dysfunction benefit from ICD treatment and these patients survive for a 
considerable time after the first shock. Survival is influenced by the degree of 
left ventricular dysfunction; aggressive treatment of heart failure is necessary 
as well as ICD therapy.

Ethical considerations in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

Tonelli MR(1).

(1)University of Washington Medical Center, Division of Pulmonary and Critical 
Care Medicine, Seattle 98112, USA.

Over the last several decades, rapid medical advancement in the treatment of 
persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) has brought with it a number of ethical 
concerns. The increasing life expectancy of persons with CF has made transitions 
in care increasingly common. This change in life expectancy along with advances 
in assisted reproductive technologies has focused attention on reproductive 
decision making in CF. Living lobar lung transplantation, although technically 
developed, remains ethically problematic. The understanding of ethical issues 
arising in the treatment of CF is crucial to providing optimal care.

Environmental pollution and child health in the Aral Sea region in Kazakhstan.

Jensen S(1), Mazhitova Z, Zetterström R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Environmental Chemistry, Wallenberg Laboratory, Stockholm 
University, Sweden.

The deterioration of human health with increasing infant mortality rate, 
declining life expectancy at birth and increasing prevalence of serious 
infectious diseases in Russia and other former Soviet Republics is thought to be 
due to a combination of several factors such as inadequate nutrition, poor 
sanitation, collapse of the health care system and pollution from Soviet 
agriculture and industries. In the Aral Sea region in Kazakhstan, the 
environmental problems are of near catastrophic proportions. As a result of the 
implementation of a massive irrigation scheme to support the cotton fields in 
the former desert land, the water flow to the Aral Sea was reduced to less than 
half. Industrial pollutants such as PCB-compounds and heavy metals, but also the 
use of large quantities of pesticides to control parasites and weeds have 
accumulated not only in water, but also in soil and have been deposited over 
large areas by atmospheric transport to enter the food chain leading to humans. 
In a study of 15 children and of an additional 12 children referred from the 
region of the Aral Sea to the National Children's Rehabilitation Center in 
Almaty with symptoms and signs of 'ecological disease', we have found that the 
concentration of PCB compounds in the blood lipids is elevated in relation to 
healthy Swedish children. In addition, the blood lipid concentration of the 
beta-isomer of the hexachlorocyclohexanes was extremely high and of 
DDT-compounds was elevated up to 20 times. The concentrations of lead in red 
blood cells was moderately elevated and that of cadmium slightly elevated 
compared to the findings in Stockholm children. To study the role of these 
pollutants in the diseases found in children from the Aral Sea region accurate 
epidemiological studies have to be performed.

OBJECTIVE: To examine costs and cost-effectiveness ratios of a four-year mass 
media programme previously shown to prevent the onset of smoking among 
adolescents.
DESIGN: A matched control design.
SETTING: Two cities in Montana, one in New York and one in Vermont, USA.
SUBJECTS: Students in grades 10-12 (ages 15-18).
INTERVENTION: A four-year mass media campaign to prevent the onset of smoking.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per student potentially exposed to the mass media 
campaign; cost per student smoker potentially averted; and cost per life-year 
gained. Cost estimates were also made for a similar campaign that would be 
broadcast nationally in the United States.
RESULTS: In 1996 dollars, the cost of developing and broadcasting the mass media 
campaign was $759,436, and the cost per student potentially exposed to the 
campaign (n = 18,600) was $41. The cost per student smoker averted (n = 1023) 
was $754 (95% confidence interval (CI) = $531-$1296). The cost per life-year 
gained discounted at 3% over the life expectancy for young adult smokers was 
$696 (95% CI = $445-$1269). The estimated cost of developing and broadcasting a 
similar four-year mass media campaign in all 209 American media markets would be 
approximately $84.5 million, at a cost of $8 per student potentially exposed to 
a national campaign, $162 per student smoker averted, and $138 (95% CI = 
$88-$252) per life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: Estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios of this mass media 
campaign in preventing the onset of smoking showed it to be economically 
attractive and to compare favourably with other preventive and therapeutic 
strategies.

[A pedigree of autosomal dominant limb-girdle myopathy with rimmed vacuole 
formation].

[Article in Japanese]

Kishibayashi J, Sunohara N, Saito Y.

We describe a kindred with autosomal dominant myopathy with preferential 
proximal limb muscle involvement. This disorder is characterized clinically by 
early adult onset, slow progression, normal life expectancy, weakness and 
atrophy of proximal limb muscles, especially in the lower limbs. Laboratory 
examinations showed myopathic changes mixed with neuropathic components on 
needle electromyography, slight elevation of serum creatine kinase, and absent 
cardiac involvement. In biopsied muscle findings of two patients, the presence 
of rimmed vacuoles was the most striking finding to explain muscle degeneration, 
though a few necrotic fibers were present. The pathologic and clinical findings 
in the present family are almost similar to those seen in "adult-onset autosomal 
dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy" reported by Chutkow et al.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a simplified protocol for pessary management.
METHODS: Women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse who opted for pessaries 
were enrolled in a prospective simplified protocol for pessary management. After 
the initial pessary fitting, they were seen at 2 weeks for reexamination and 
thereafter at 3- to 6-month intervals.
RESULTS: One hundred ten women (mean age 65 years) were enrolled, and 81 (74%) 
of them were fitted successfully with a pessary. Life-table analysis showed that 
66% of those who used a pessary for more than 1 month were still users after 12 
months and 53% were still users after 36 months. The severity of pelvic prolapse 
did not predict the likelihood of pessary failure except in cases of complete 
vaginal eversion. Patients complaining of stress incontinence were less likely 
to have a successful pessary fitting and more likely to opt for surgery. Current 
hormone use and substantial perineal support do not predict greater likelihood 
of pessary fitting success. No serious complications from using the pessary were 
observed in the study sample.
CONCLUSION: Stringent guidelines calling for frequent pelvic examinations during 
pessary use can be relaxed safely. Pessaries can be offered as a safe long-term 
option for the management of pelvic prolapse.

Double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled evaluation of clarithromycin and 
omeprazole for Helicobacter pylori-associated duodenal ulcer.

O'Morain C(1), Dettmer A, Rambow A, von Fritsch E, Fraser AG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Gastroenterology, Meath Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori leads to faster ulcer healing and 
a significant decrease in ulcer recurrence. Clarithromycin is the most effective 
monotherapy for eradicating H. pylori from the gastric mucosa, and omeprazole 
frequently is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease, prompting the 
interest to investigate rigorously the combination of clarithromycin and 
omeprazole for eradicating H. pylori.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this double-blind, randomized, multicenter (n 
= 30), multinational (n = 10) study was to compare clarithromycin and omeprazole 
with omeprazole monotherapy for the eradication of H. pylori from the gastric 
mucosa, endoscopic healing, and reduction of symptoms and ulcer recurrence in 
patients with active duodenal ulcer. Patients with active duodenal ulcer 
associated with H. pylori infection were randomized to receive omeprazole, 40 mg 
every morning for 14 days, with either clarithromycin, 500 mg, or placebo three 
times daily, which was followed by omeprazole, 20 mg every morning for 14 days. 
Patients underwent endoscopy before enrolling in the study, immediately after 
finishing treatment, and at 4- to 6-week and 6-month follow-up evaluations or at 
the recurrence of symptoms.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients with active duodenal ulcer associated 
with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to treatment with either 
clarithromycin and omeprazole (n = 102) or omeprazole and placebo (n = 106). 
Four to six weeks after treatment was completed, H. pylori was eradicated in 74% 
(95% confidence interval, 63.0%-82.4%) of patients receiving clarithromycin and 
omeprazole, compared with 1% (0.0%-6.2%) of patients receiving omeprazole 
monotherapy (p < .001). Clarithromycin resistance developed in eight patients 
treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole and in none given omeprazole and 
placebo. Ulcers, which were healed following treatment in more than 95% of study 
patients, recurred by the 6-month follow-up visit in 10% (5%-19%) of dual 
therapy recipients, compared with 50% (39%-61%) of those who took omeprazole 
alone (p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and 
well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients 
with duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection.

BACKGROUND: The NIH Consensus Conference in 1994 (1) concluded that all patients 
with peptic ulcer disease should be tested and treated for Helicobacter pylori 
and that further evaluation was needed for patients in remission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated in a double blind randomization 30 patients 
whose duodenal ulcers had been healed with H2-receptor antagonists and who 
remained in remission on maintenance therapy. After ulcer healing and the 
presence of H. pylori had been confirmed, these patients were randomized to 
receive eradication therapy or placebo and were followed for a mean period of 23 
months.
RESULTS: Almost all patients receiving placebo had ulcer recurrence, whereas the 
patients treated with antibiotics demonstrate a low recurrence rate.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, the 
importance of treating with antibiotics duodenal ulcer patients whose disease is 
in remission.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To provide reliable and valid empirical data related to New 
England Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) members' self-reported practices of 
assisted suicide and patient-requested euthanasia. Analysis focused on the 
nurses' practices, a comparison of their practices to a similar sample of 
oncology physicians, and their use of the healthcare team.
DESIGN: Quantitative survey.
SETTING: New England region of the United States.
SAMPLE: 600 ONS members surveyed by mail, 441 of whom responded (74% return 
rate). Only nurses who worked at least 20 hours per week, were ONS members for 
at least one year, and worked with adult patients with cancer were included.
METHODS: Replication and extension of a survey of oncology physicians.
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Frequency of requests for and responses to patient 
requests for assisted suicide and euthanasia and the use of the healthcare team 
in response to these requests.
FINDINGS: More physicians than nurses assisted their patients' suicides (11% 
versus 1%). However, nurses were more likely than physicians to have performed 
patient-requested euthanasia (4% versus 1%). Nurses frequently consulted with 
others--particularly physicians--about patient requests for assistance with 
death but rarely with one another including nursing supervisors.
CONCLUSIONS: The relative number of healthcare professionals (physicians or 
nurses) who admit to hastening a patient's death is small. Nurses in this study 
received fewer requests to perform euthanasia than physicians, but they 
performed patient-requested euthanasia four times more frequently than 
physicians. Professional affiliation appears to be one factor in determining 
whether or not a patient's request for assistance with death will be granted. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICES: The policy debate about professional roles 
in actions that end the lives of patients must be extended beyond physicians to 
include nurses. Nurses must take an active role in the discussion and definition 
of acceptable practice at the end of life.

ribosome, has been cloned from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon, Pyrococcus 
furiosus, by a novel method effectively using its cosmid protein library, 
sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence encodes a protein 
containing 295 amino acid residues with methionine at the N-terminus. From 
protein analyses of the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli, by using both 
amino acid sequence analysis from the N-terminus by automated Edman degradation 
and analyses of molecular masses of the peptides generated by two enzymatic 
cleavages performed independently, digestions with lysylendopeptidase and 
Endoproteinase Asp-N, with ionspray mass spectrometry, the primary structure of 
the protein has been elucidated to be completely identical with that deduced 
from its DNA sequence. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of P. furiosus MAP 
(P.f. MAP) with those of other MAPs from Eukarya and Bacteria showed that the 
protein has a high degree of sequence homology in the stretches surrounding the 
five cobalt-binding residues fully preserved in all of MAPs determined so far, 
but P.f. MAP belongs to Type II because it has an extra long insertion of about 
60 amino acid residues between the fourth and fifth cobalt-binding ligands, 
similar to MAPs from human and rat, and to Met-AP2 from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, in comparison to Type I MAPs from Bacteria. Therefore, P.f. MAP 
seems to be rather close to those from Eukarya, although it is distinct in 
lacking the N-terminal extension of about 90-150 residues universally found in 
MAPs from Eukarya. These findings suggest that P.f. MAP is evolutionally located 
at the Eukarya-Bacteria boundary. The enzyme expressed in E. coli exhibits a 
considerable thermostability, with a half-life of approximately 4.5 h at 90 
degrees C and an optimum temperature of around 90 degrees C.

The quality-of-life effects of interferon beta-1b in multiple sclerosis. An 
extended Q-TWiST analysis.

Mass., USA.

BACKGROUND: A recombinant form of interferon beta-1b (Betaseron) was given Food 
and Drug Administration approval for use in the treatment of relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis in 1993 based on a documented reduction in exacerbation rate. 
However, its effect on disease progression is less clear. It costs $11,000 per 
year and has documented adverse effects such as fatigue, feverlike symptoms, and 
depression.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a recombinant form of interferon beta-1b in the 
treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and to discuss treatment 
trade-offs and comprehensive quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes.
METHODS: We present a randomized evaluation of treatment with a recombinant form 
of interferon beta-1b in 79 patients with multiple sclerosis who participated in 
a random allocation lottery and were followed up for 12 months, during which 
data on QOL and clinical outcomes were collected. The data were analyzed using 
the Extended Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity (Q-TWiST) 
method, which evaluates treatment trade-offs by incorporating several QOL 
domains and patient preferences regarding these domains.
RESULTS: Over the 12 months of follow-up, the case patients reported 10.6 months 
of quality-adjusted time, while the control patients reported 10.4 months of 
quality-adjusted time (P = .50).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the first year of treatment with interferon beta-1b did not 
significantly improve or detract from QOL. Results are discussed in terms of 
acceptable trade-offs depending on the nature of therapy. Future observational 
and clinical studies should incorporate measures of patient preference.

Breastfeeding practices in Indonesia.

Suharyono(1), Paul M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Child Health, Medical School University of Indonesia, Jakarta, 
Indonesia.

Breastfeeding promotion program was started by the paediatricians and others in 
1977, and is becoming a strong activity since 1990 it was declared by the 
President of the Republic of Indonesia as a National Movement. One year later 
the First Lady stated the importance of every Indonesian mother to breast-feed 
her baby, and thereafter many hospitals created the so called "Baby Friendly 
Hospital". In this occasion we only limit with eminent topics, i.e., "Exclusive 
Breast-feeding" in Indonesia, and "Breastfeeding amongst Working Mothers." In 
fact, until now the percentage of mothers who breastfeed exclusively is very 
low. Although the ever breastfed babies in Indonesia is 97% (Kodyat, 1996) but 
the data of the "Exclusive Breastfeeding" of Indonesia is just like Pakistan and 
Thailand, i.e. nearly 2 months, whereas the Philippines and Ceylon showed a 
figure of 4 months, and India 5 months. The Home Health Survey (SKRT) data in 
1992 showed that 63.7% of the babies were exclusively breast-fed until 3 months. 
Three quarter of the quality of the exclusive breastmilk is quite good, enough 
or excellent, whereas the other one quarter is poor and this should be 
interfered by increasing the quality of the breastmilk and/or adding other 
formula, to prevent the baby of getting "failure to thrive" (Suharyono, 1996). 
Working mothers use to do "Early Weaning Practices" with very high mixed feeding 
practices (Matulessy et al, 1996). Mothers have to go to work because they have 
to support their family income, but unfortunately most of them ignore their main 
task of care their children.
IN CONCLUSION: the experience in Indonesia proves that a very hard work should 
still be continued on the effort of promoting breastfeeding, especially 
regarding the two issues, i.e. "Exclusive breastfeeding" (we do hope at least 
until 4 months) and the other issue is regarding the "Working Mothers".

PIP: Official efforts to promote breast feeding in Indonesia and to urge 
hospitals to adopt "baby-friendly" policies have increased the proportion of 
breast-fed infants to 97%. The duration of exclusive breast feeding is less than 
3 months, however, despite official advocacy of breast milk only for 4 months. 
Moreover, the proportion of infants exclusively breast fed for 4 months actually 
declined from 51% in 1991 to 47% in 1994. Factors associated with the early 
introduction of infant formula and solid foods include lack of sufficient 
quantity of breast milk, suckling problems, inverted nipple, formula 
advertisements, mothers' desire to be "modern," low support from husbands, 
hospitals' failure to implement rooming-in, and the special difficulties faced 
by working mothers. The Indonesian Government has launched an IEC campaign to 
achieve an exclusive breast feeding rate of 80-100% by the year 2000. This goal 
will require the referral of women who experience difficulties with breast 
feeding to lactation clinics, the provision of opportunities for women to breast 
feed at workplaces (e.g., employment-based day care centers), extension of the 
pregnancy leave further into the postpartum period, and establishment of 
baby-friendly communities and districts.

Effects of cryopreserved semen quality and timed intrauterine insemination on 
pregnancy rate and gender of offspring in a donor insemination program.

Sidhu RS(1), Sharma RK, Agarwal A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.

PURPOSE: Our purpose was to study the relationship among cryopreserved donor 
semen quality, pregnancy rates, and preconception sex selection after 
intrauterine insemination.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of the 203 women in our donor insemination 
program from 1987 to 1994 who became pregnant after more than one insemination 
cycle and had no female-factor infertility. They were categorized according to 
the number of cycles required for pregnancy. Semen samples from 54 donors were 
analyzed before freezing and after thawing. Specimens resulting in pregnancy 
were compared to specimens from the same donor that did not. Semen 
characteristics were compared to gender of the child.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty two-women became pregnant of the 422 who were 
enrolled. The pregnancy rate per cycle was 13%. Semen quality was not related to 
pregnancy outcome or offspring gender. However, more male children (101 vs 83) 
were born.
CONCLUSIONS: Semen characteristics in good-quality cryopreserved donor semen do 
not affect pregnancy rate or offspring gender.

Preoperative cardiac assessment of the thoracic surgical patient.

Teplick R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Anesthesia, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, 
Massachusetts, USA.

The preoperative cardiac assessment of the thoracic patient differs very little 
from the assessment of any patient for noncardiac surgery, aside from a few 
special issues. Therefore, rather than reviewing the general issue of evaluation 
for noncardiac surgery, which is a topic that has been reviewed many times in 
the recent past, this article focuses on the purposes, methods, and limitations 
of risk assessment in the noncardiac surgical patient with suspected coronary 
artery disease (CAD), including thoracic surgical patients. Because risk 
assessment is imprecise and the main indications for invasive coronary 
procedures prior to noncardiac surgery are the same for any person for whom 
life-expectancy is expected to be prolonged, meticulous preoperative evaluation 
for CAD is not usually warranted, even for patients undergoing high-risk surgery 
or with multiple risk factors for CAD. To help understand this point of view and 
to utilize cardiology consultants appropriately, implications of basic 
pathophysiology as well as statistical principles are also discussed.

Aging and the brain: a new frontier.

Drachman DA(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, 
Worcester 01655, USA.

With aging, both "normal" senescent age-related changes (ARCs) and late-onset 
diseases affect the brain, producing declines in performance. The brain as a 
postmitotic structure is particularly vulnerable to ARCs, and senescence is by 
far the most powerful risk factor for neurological diseases of the elderly such 
as sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The concept of senescence as an immutable 
result of the passage of time is yielding to understanding of the biology of 
ARCs. Both individual and species differences in longevity illustrate the 
variable effects of time. Whereas human life expectancy has been extended by 
prevention and treatment of specific diseases, life span can be altered by 
modifying the processes producing ARCs. Models of prolonged life span (eg, 
modifications of Caenorhabditis elegans longevity genes, restricted caloric 
intake) demonstrate the feasibility of extending longevity throughout the 
phylogenetic spectrum. Both programmed and variable factors produce ARCs. Cell 
survival depends on a balance of opposing factors--oncogene and anti-oncogene 
products, cyclins, growth factors, and so on; apoptotic death results when the 
balance shifts. Variable factors, including accumulation of oxygen free 
radicals, protein conformational changes, decline in chaperone functions, and 
secondary loss of mitochondrial energy production, can also result in neuronal 
degeneration. To prevent the increased neuronal vulnerability of senescence, 
ARCs must be modified. The "new frontier" in neurology is the challenge of 
understanding the changes of aging, both to determine their impact on disease 
and to prevent their consequences.

Prognosis for survival and improvement in function in children with severe 
developmental disabilities.

(1)Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside 92521, USA.

Comment in
    J Pediatr. 2001 Jan;138(1):147.

OBJECTIVE: To derive prognostic data for survival and clinical improvement in 
children with severe developmental disabilities.
STUDY DESIGN: A 13-year follow-up study of several cohorts of children initially 
evaluated before their first birthday. The outcomes studied were survival and 
improvement in condition. Methods were used to overcome limitations in 
previously published work on the same California data base. Of the 11,912 
children who received services from the California Department of Developmental 
Services between January 1980 and December 1993, we focused on three cohorts 
defined according to mobility and need for tube feeding.
RESULTS: Children who were tube fed and unable to lift their heads by ages 3 to 
12 months were at high risk for early death, with a median remaining life 
expectancy of 3.2 years. Of those who survived an additional 2 years, the 
condition of about one third improved. A substantial majority of those who 
either showed improvement or died had done so by that age.
CONCLUSION: By age 5 years, the prognoses for survival and improvement have to a 
large extent been clarified. For children who survive to age 5 years, even those 
in the lowest functioning cohort have a 60% chance of surviving an additional 5 
years. Detailing the probabilities of various outcomes at various ages should be 
useful to parents, pediatricians, and others concerned with children with 
developmental disabilities.

Asian or Pacific Islander mortality, selected states, 1992.

Hoyert DL, Kung HC.

OBJECTIVES: In this report the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
presents mortality data in greater race detail than has previously been 
presented for the Asian or Pacific Islander (API) population.
METHODS: Deaths, estimated death rates, age-adjusted death rates, exploratory 
life expectancies, and ranking of leading causes are presented for a selected 
area.
RESULTS: In 1992 a total of 19,478 deaths occurred in the Asian or Pacific 
Islander population in the seven States examined in this report. Heart disease 
and cancer were the two leading causes of death for each of the Asian or Pacific 
Islander subgroups. By age there is striking variation in leading causes among 
the race groups. Among the API subgroups in these States, age-adjusted death 
rates are greatest for the Samoan and Hawaiian populations and smallest for the 
Asian Indian, Korean, and Japanese populations. Life expectancy is lowest for 
the Hawaiian and Samoan populations.

Births and deaths: United States, 1996.

Ventura SJ, Peters KD, Martin JA, Maurer JD.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents preliminary data on births and deaths in the 
United States from the National Center for Health Statistics for 1996. U.S. data 
are shown by age, race, and Hispanic origin. National and State data on births 
by marital status, prenatal care, cesarean delivery, and low birthweight are 
also presented. Mortality data presented include life expectancy, leading causes 
of death, and infant mortality.
METHODS: This report, the third in a new statistical series, presents 
preliminary data for 1996 on births and deaths based on a substantial sample of 
vital records. The records are weighted to independent control counts of births, 
infant deaths, and total deaths received in State vital statistics offices 
during calendar year 1996.
RESULTS: According to preliminary data for 1996, the birth rate for teenagers 
dropped 4 percent in 1996 to 54.7 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years. The 
teen birth rate has declined 12 percent since 1991 (62.1), with larger
