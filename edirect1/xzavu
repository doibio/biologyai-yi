BACKGROUND: A recent systematic review has indicated that mortality within the 
first year after hip fracture repair increases significantly if the time from 
hospital admission to surgery exceeds forty-eight hours. Further investigation 
has shown that avoidable, systems-based factors contribute substantially to 
delay in surgery. In this study, an economic evaluation was conducted to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical scenario in which resources 
are allocated to expedite surgery so that it is performed within forty-eight 
hours after admission.
METHODS: We created a decision tree to tabulate incremental cost and 
quality-adjusted life years in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two 
potential strategies. Several factors, including personnel cost, patient volume, 
percentage of patients receiving surgical treatment within forty-eight hours, 
and mortality associated with delayed surgery, were considered. One strategy 
focused solely on expediting preoperative evaluation by employing personnel to 
conduct the necessary diagnostic tests and a hospitalist physician to conduct 
the medical evaluation outside of regular hours. The second strategy added an 
on-call team (nurse, surgical technologist, and anesthesiologist) to staff an 
operating room outside of regular hours.
RESULTS: The evaluation-focused strategy was cost-effective, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $2318 per quality-adjusted life year, and became 
cost-saving (a dominant therapeutic approach) if =93% of patients underwent 
expedited surgery, the hourly cost of retaining a diagnostic technologist on 
call was <$20.80, or <15% of the hospitalist's salary was funded by the 
strategy. The second strategy, which added an on-call surgical team, was also 
cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $43,153 per 
quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis revealed that this strategy 
remained cost-effective if the odds ratio of one-year mortality associated with 
delayed surgery was >1.28, =88% of patients underwent early surgery, or =339.9 
patients with a hip fracture were treated annually.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that systems-based solutions to 
minimize operative delay, such as a dedicated on-call support team, can be 
cost-effective. Additionally, an evaluation-focused intervention can be 
cost-saving, depending on its success rate and associated personnel cost.

the lung.

BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing and first-line 
therapy with gefitinib for patients with activating mutations is quickly 
becoming the standard option for the treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma. 
Yet, to date, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of EGFR testing and first-line treatment with gefitinib for 
those patients who harbor activating mutations versus standard care, which 
includes first-line treatment with chemotherapy followed by gefitinib as 
second-line treatment. The model uses clinical and outcomes data from randomized 
clinical trials and societal costs from Singapore cancer centers. Health effects 
were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. All costs and cost-effectiveness 
ratios were expressed in 2010 Singapore dollars. Sensitivity and different 
scenarios analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: EGFR testing and first-line treatment with gefitinib is a dominant 
strategy (with lower costs and greater effectiveness) compared with standard 
care. Because the primary savings result from not providing gefitinib to those 
who are not likely to benefit, this finding holds regardless of the prevalence 
of activating mutations. In a secondary analysis, first-line treatment with 
gefitinib was also dominant when compared with first-line chemotherapy in 
patients with activating EGFR mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: This strategy can be considered a new standard of care and should 
be of great interest for health care payers and decision makers in an era in 
which our greatest challenge is to balance hard-won and incremental, yet small, 
improvements in patient outcomes with exponentially rising costs.

Studies of interventions for dyslexia have focused entirely on outcomes related 
to literacy. In this study, we considered a broader picture assessing improved 
quality of life compared with costs. A model served as a tool to compare costs 
and effects of treatment according to a new protocol and care as usual. Quality 
of life was measured and valued by proxies using a general quality-of-life 
instrument (EQ-5D). We considered medical cost and non-medical cost (e.g. 
remedial teaching). The model computed cost per successful treatment and cost 
per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in time. About 75% of the total costs was 
related to diagnostic tests to distinguish between children with severe dyslexia 
and children who have reading difficulties for other reasons. The costs per 
successful treatment of severe dyslexia were €36 366. Successful treatment 
showed a quality-of-life gain of about 11%. At primary school, the average cost 
per QALY for severe dyslexia amounted to €58 647. In the long term, the cost per 
QALY decreased to €26 386 at secondary school and €17 663 thereafter. The 
results of this study provide evidence that treatment of severe dyslexia is 
cost-effective when the investigated protocol is followed.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic diseases, with increasing 
importance due to increased life expectancy. On a cellular level, the 
pathophysiology of joint function impairment and ultimate destruction associated 
with OA remains poorly understood. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules 
involved in both normal intracellular signal transduction and degenerative 
cellular processes. An imbalance between the free radical burden and cellular 
scavenging mechanisms, defined as oxidative stress, has been identified as a 
relevant factor in OA pathogenesis. This literature review elucidates the 
involvement of nitrosative and oxidative stress in cellular ageing in joints, 
cell senescence, and apoptosis. Free radical exposure is known to promote 
cellular senescence and apoptosis, and the involvement of radical oxygen species 
(ROS) in inflammation, fibrosis control, and pain nociception has been proven. A 
relatively novel approach to OA pathophysiology considers the joint to be a 
dynamic system consisting of 3, continuously interacting compartments, 
cartilage, synovial tissue, and subchondral bone. Current knowledge concerning 
free radical involvement in paracrine signalling in OA is reviewed. The 
interrelationship between oxidative imbalances and OA pathophysiology may 
provide a novel approach to the comprehension, and therefore modification, of OA 
disease progression and symptom control.

Genomic biomarkers and clinical outcomes of physical activity.

Clinical and experimental studies in humans provide evidence that moderate 
physical activity significantly decreases artery oxidative damage to nuclear 
DNA, DNA-adducts related to age and dyslipedemia, and mitochondrial DNA damage. 
Maintenance of adequate mitochondrial function is crucial for preventing lipid 
accumulation and peroxidation occurring in atherosclerosis. Studies performed on 
human muscle biopsies analyzing gene expression in living humans reveal that 
physically active subjects improve the expression of genes involved in 
mitochondrial function and of related microRNAs. The attenuation of oxidative 
damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA by physical activity resulted in 
beneficial effects due to polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferases genes. 
Subjects bearing null GSTM1/T1 polymorphisms have poor life expectancy in the 
case of being sedentary, which was increased 2.6-fold in case they performed 
physical activity. These findings indicate that the preventive effect of 
physical activity undergoes interindividual variation affected by genetic 
polymorphisms.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination of 
11-year-old girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and increased 
screening coverage to prevent cervical cancer in Japan where the coverage of 
Papanicolaou smears is very low.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective.
SETTING: Japan, 2010.
POPULATION: The female Japanese population aged 11 years or older.
METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was 
constructed to compare six strategies: i.e. a screening coverage rate of 20, 50 
and 80% with and without routine vaccination at age 11.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical cancer incidence, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Expanding the coverage of Papanicolaou smears from the current level of 
20-50 and 80% yields a 45.5 and 63.1% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, 
respectively. Impact of combined strategies increases with coverage. Coverages 
of 20, 50 and 80% showed a 66.1, 80.9 and 86.8% reduction in disease, 
respectively. The costs of strategies with vaccination are four times higher 
than the cost of strategies without vaccination. Vaccinating all 11-year-old 
girls with bivalent vaccines with a Papanicolaou smear coverage rate of 50% is 
likely to be the most cost-effective option among the six strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of HPV vaccination in Japan is cost-effective as 
in other countries. It is more cost-effective to increase the coverage of the 
Papanicolaou smear along with the universal administration of HPV vaccine.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the impact of gender on long-term 
survival of patients who underwent non-cardiac vascular surgery.
DESIGN, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our prospectively collected data contained 
information on 560 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 923 
elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs (AAA) and 1046 lower limb 
reconstructions (LLR). Patient characteristics and long-term mortality of women 
were compared to that of men. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were constructed 
for men and women, on which we superimposed age- and sex-matched KM survival 
curves of the general population. Cox proportional hazards regression was used 
to identify risk factors for mortality.
RESULTS: Men in the CEA group had statistically significant higher all-cause 
mortality, hazard rate ratio (HRR) 1.41 (95% CI 1.01-1.98) No differences in 
mortality between the genders were observed in the AAA and LLR groups. Overall, 
men had more co-morbidities but received more disease-specific medication 
compared to women. Women retained their higher life expectancy after CEA but 
lost it in the AAA and LLR groups.
CONCLUSION: Women retain their higher life expectancy after CEA; however, after 
AAA repair and LLR, this advantage is lost. Both men and women received too 
little disease-specific medication, but women were worse off.

Patient-derived outcome measures for HIV services in the developed world: a 
systematic review.

This review sought to establish the themes and approaches used in the 
measurement of patient satisfaction regarded by HIV service users as crucial to 
improving service quality. It also investigated how feedback has been measured 
previously and whether a gold standard instrument exists that is generalizable 
across HIV inpatient and clinic settings. Twelve databases and other sources 
yielded 1474 titles. Using a clinically-focused question and pre-defined 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, 32 articles were retrieved and reviewed for 
quality using a quality appraisal checklist. Two reviewers used a data 
extraction form to identify and verify key patient experiences. Thematic 
analysis revealed that clinic staffs' current knowledge of HIV was an essential 
factor in positive feedback. Treating patients with dignity and respecting their 
autonomy and confidentiality were also important. Developments in treatment, 
extended life expectancy and quality of life have altered patients' experience 
and level of satisfaction. Three instruments developed to assess patient 
satisfaction with HIV care were identified but there was no gold standard method 
of measuring it. There is a need to develop a specific, valid instrument that is 
easy to complete and analyse, and the data should be used to inform the redesign 
of services to promote a dynamic model of care.

various primary tumor groups: evaluation of 448 patients in the Aarhus spinal 
metastases database.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 448 patients with 
spinal metastases from a variety of cancer groups.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the specific predictive value of the Tokuhashi scoring 
system (T12) and its revised version (T15) in spinal metastases of various 
primary tumors.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The life expectancy of patients with spinal 
metastases is one of the most important factors in selecting the treatment 
modality. Tokuhashi et al formulated a prognostic scoring system with a total 
sum of 12 points for preoperative prediction of life expectancy in 1990 and 
revised it in 2005 to a total sum of 15 points. There is a lack of knowledge 
about the specific predictive value of those scoring systems in patients with 
spinal metastases from a variety of cancer groups.
METHODS: We included 448 patients with vertebral metastases who underwent 
surgical treatment during November 1992 to November 2009 in Aarhus University 
Hospital NBG. Data were retrieved from Aarhus Metastases Database. Scores based 
on T12 and T15 were calculated prospectively for each patient. We divided all 
the patients into different groups dictated by the site of their primary tumor. 
Predictive value and accuracy rate of the 2 scoring systems were compared in 
each cancer group.
RESULTS: Both the T12 and T15 scoring systems showed statistically significant 
predictive value when the 448 patients were analyzed in total (T12, P < 0.0001; 
T15, P < 0.0001). The accuracy rate was significantly higher in T15 (P < 0.0001) 
than in T12. The further analyses by primary cancer groups showed that the 
predictive value of T12 and T15 was primarily determined by the prostate (P = 
0.0003) and breast group (P = 0.0385). Only T12 displayed predictive value in 
the colon group (P = 0.0011). Neither of the scoring systems showed significant 
predictive value in the lung (P > 0.05), renal (P > 0.05), or miscellaneous 
primary tumor groups (P > 0.05). The accuracy rate of prognosis in T15 was 
significantly improved in the prostate (P = 0.0032) and breast group (P < 
0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Both T12 and T15 showed significant predictive value in patients 
with spinal metastases. T15 has a statistically higher accuracy rate than T12. 
Among the various cancer groups, the 2 scoring systems are especially reliable 
in prostate and breast metastases groups. T15 is recommended as superior to T12 
because of its higher accuracy rate.

No consistent effects of prenatal or neonatal exposure to Spanish flu on 
late-life mortality in 24 developed countries.

We test the effects of early life exposure to disease on later health by looking 
for differences in late-life mortality in cohorts born around the 1918-1919 flu 
pandemic using data from the Human Mortality Database for 24 countries. After 
controlling for age, period, and sex effects, residual mortality rates did not 
differ systematically for flu cohorts relative to surrounding cohorts. We 
calculate at most a 20-day reduction in life expectancy for flu cohorts; likely 
values are much smaller. Estimates of influenza incidence during the pandemic 
suggest that exposure was high enough for this to be a robust negative result.

A severe variant of vasovagal syncope, observed during tilt tests and blood 
donation has recently been termed "prolonged post-faint hypotension" (PPFH). A 
49-year-old male with a life-long history of severe fainting attacks underwent 
head-up tilt for 20 min, and developed syncope 2 min after nitroglycerine spray. 
He was unconscious for 40 s and asystolic for 22 s. For the first 2 min of 
recovery, BP and HR remained low (65/45 mmHg and 40 beats/min) despite passive 
leg-raising. Blood pressure (and symptoms) only improved following active 
bilateral leg flexion and extension ("dynamic tension"). During PPFH, when vagal 
activity is extreme, patients may require central stimulation as well as 
correction of venous return.

Estimates of cost-effectiveness analyses are typically obtained either directly 
from 'trial' based analyses or indirectly via surrogate endpoints in 'model' 
based analyses. Data from clinical trials that include both surrogate and final 
endpoints can be used in a joint analysis that combines these two approaches. 
This joint approach allows the inclusion of information regarding the effects of 
treatment on surrogate endpoints while relaxing the strong assumption of 
'conditional independence' associated with indirect model-based analyses. An 
example cost-effectiveness analysis of Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme 
is used to compare the different approaches. It is shown that despite using a 
common data set, the different analytic approaches produce differing estimates 
of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and the value of future research. 
The paper concludes by discussing the selection of the appropriate analytic 
approach.

Regulation of cell cycle components during exposure to anoxia or dehydration 
stress in the wood frog, Rana sylvatica.

Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The wood frog (Rana sylvatica) exhibits a well-developed natural anoxia and 
dehydration tolerance. The degree of stress tolerance depends on numerous 
biochemical adaptations, including stress-induced hypometabolism that helps to 
preserve long-term viability by reducing ATP demand. We hypothesized that the 
mechanisms involved in cell cycle control could act to aid in the establishment 
of the hypometabolic state required for stress survival. Selected proteins 
involved in the proliferation of cells were evaluated using immunoblotting in 
liver and skeletal muscle of wood frogs comparing controls with animals 
subjected to either 24-hr anoxia exposure under a nitrogen gas atmosphere or 
dehydration to 40% of total body water lost (all at 5°C). Levels of cyclins 
(type A, B, D, and E) decreased significantly under both stresses in liver and 
skeletal muscle. Similar reductions were seen for Cyclin-dependant kinases (Cdk) 
types 2, 4, and 6 in both liver and skeletal muscle; however, an increase in the 
relative amount of phosphorylated inactive p-Cdk (Thr14/Tyr15) was observed in 
liver under both stresses. Levels of positive regulators of Cdk activity (Cdc25 
type A and C) were significantly reduced in both tissues under both stresses, 
whereas negative regulators of Cdk activity (p16(INK4a) and p27(KIP1) ) 
increased significantly in liver under both anoxia and dehydration stress (but 
not in muscle). This study provides the first report of differential regulation 
of cell cycle components in an anoxia and dehydration tolerant vertebrate, the 
wood frog, suggesting that cell cycle suppression is an active part of stress 
resistance and life extension in hypometabolic states.

Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.

As life expectancy increases, valvular heart disease is becoming more common. 
Management of heart disease and primarily valvular heart disease is expected to 
represent a significant proportion of healthcare provided to the elderly 
population. Recent years have brought a progression of surgical treatments 
toward less invasive strategies. This has given rise to percutaneous approaches 
for the correction of valvular heart disease. Percutaneous mitral valve repair 
using the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) creates a 
double orifice and has been successfully used in selected patients with mitral 
regurgitation. We review the rationale, procedural aspects, and clinical data 
thus far available for the MitraClip approach to mitral regurgitation.

OBJECTIVES: To further validate an index predicting mortality in 
community-dwelling older adults.
DESIGN: A comparison of the performance of the index in predicting mortality 
among new respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2001-2004) 
with that of respondents from the original development and validation cohorts 
(1997-2000) and a test of its performance over extended follow-up (up to 9 
years) using the original cohorts. Follow-up mortality data were available 
through 2006.
SETTING: NHIS.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two thousand fifty-seven new respondents to the NHIS 
(2001-2004) and 24,139 respondents from the original development and validation 
cohorts (1997-2000).
MEASUREMENTS: A risk score was calculated for each respondent based on the 
presence or absence of 11 factors (function, illnesses, behaviors, demographics) 
that make up the index. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, 5-year mortality 
estimates were computed for the new and original cohort respondents and 9-year 
mortality estimates for the original cohorts.
RESULTS: New respondents were similar to original cohort respondents but were 
slightly more likely to be aged 85 and older, report diabetes mellitus, and have 
a body mass index of 25.0 kg/m² or greater. The model performed as well in the 
new cohort as it had in the original cohort. New respondents with risk scores of 
0 to 1 had a 2% risk of 5-year mortality, whereas respondents who scored 18 or 
higher had a 69% risk of 5-year mortality (range 3-71% risk of 5-year mortality 
in the development cohort). The index also demonstrated excellent calibration 
and discrimination in predicting 9-year mortality (range 7% risk for scores of 
0-1 to 92% risk for scores of ≥ 18, original validation cohort extended).
CONCLUSION: These results further justify use of this index to estimate life 
expectancy in clinical decision-making.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is widely prescribed for adults with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but data on long-term treatment and maintenance 
of effect are lacking. Osmotic release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) 
was evaluated in a 52-wk open-label study in subjects who had previously 
completed a short-term placebo-controlled trial and short-term open-label 
extension. Efficacy was assessed using the investigator- and subject-rated 
Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS:O-SV and CAARS:S-S), and the Clinical 
Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Quality 
of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). Subjects completing 
≥52 wk of treatment were eligible for a 4-wk randomized, placebo-controlled 
withdrawal phase in which loss of treatment effect was assessed using CAARS:O-SV 
and CGI-S. In the open-label phase (n=156), mean CAARS:O-SV score decreased from 
baseline by 1.9±7.8 (p<0.01), and small, statistically significant improvements 
from baseline were observed for CAARS:S-S, CGI-S and SDS. In the double-blind 
phase (OROS-MPH, n=23; placebo, n=22), CAARS:O-SV increased from double-blind 
baseline in the OROS-MPH and placebo arms (4.0±7.6 vs. 6.5±7.8, not 
statistically significant). Long-term OROS-MPH treatment was well tolerated, and 
there was no evidence of withdrawal or rebound after discontinuation. In 
conclusion, the short-term benefits of OROS-MPH continue during long-term 
open-label treatment. Maintenance of efficacy in a placebo-controlled withdrawal 
design remains to be confirmed in larger patient populations.

Increased iron supplied through Fet3p results in replicative life span extension 
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions requiring respiratory metabolism.

We have previously shown that copper supplementation extends the replicative 
life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae when grown under conditions forcing cells 
to respire. We now show that copper's effect on life span is through Fet3p, a 
copper containing enzyme responsible for high affinity transport of iron into 
yeast cells. Life span extensions can also be obtained by supplementing the 
growth medium with 1mM ferric chloride. Extension by high iron levels is still 
dependent on the presence of Fet3p. Life span extension by iron or copper 
requires growth on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source, which 
forces yeast to respire. Yeast grown on glucose containing media supplemented 
with iron show no extension of life span. The iron associated with cells grown 
in media supplemented with copper or iron is 1.4-1.8 times that of cells grown 
without copper or iron supplementation. As with copper supplementation, iron 
supplementation partially rescues the life span of superoxide dismutase mutants. 
Cells grown with copper supplementation display decreased production of 
superoxide as measured by dihydroethidium staining.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conceived to describe the evolution of aortic 
dimensions in patients with moderate post-stenotic ascending aorta dilation (50 
to 59 mm) submitted to aortic valve replacement (AVR) alone.
BACKGROUND: The appropriate treatment of post-stenotic ascending aorta dilation 
has been poorly investigated.
METHODS: Ninety-three patients affected by severe isolated calcific aortic valve 
stenosis in the tricuspid aortic valve accompanied by moderate dilation of the 
ascending aorta (50 to 59 mm) were submitted to AVR only. All patients were 
followed for a mean of 14.7 ± 4.8 years by means of periodic clinical 
evaluations and echocardiography and tomography scans of the thorax.
RESULTS: Operative mortality was 1.0% (1 patient). During the follow-up, 16 
patients died and 2 had to be reoperated for valve dysfunction. No patients 
experienced acute aortic events (rupture, dissection, pseudoaneurysm), and no 
patient had to be reoperated on the aorta. There was not a substantial increase 
in aortic dimensions: mean aortic diameter was 57 ± 11 mm at the end of the 
follow-up versus 56 ± 02 mm pre-operatively (p = NS). The mean ascending aorta 
expansion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 mm/year.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of connective tissue disorders, AVR alone is 
sufficient to prevent further aortic expansion in patients with moderate 
post-stenotic dilation of the ascending aorta. Aortic replacement can probably 
be reserved for patients with a long life expectancy.

Impact of incidental renal artery stenosis on long-term mortality in patients 
with peripheral arterial disease undergoing vascular procedure.

OBJECTIVE: In peripheral arterial disease (PAD), mortality is high. Incidental 
renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a predictor of mortality in PAD patients 
undergoing angiography. This might be relevant for risk-benefit assessment when 
vascular surgery is considered, both in terms of perioperative risk, and in 
terms of life expectancy.
METHODS: We studied the prognostic impact of incidental RAS in 488 subjects (334 
men, 154 women; mean follow-up 6.0 ± 3.4 years) who underwent angiography for 
PAD in a single center between 1997 and 2000. Renal arteries were visualized and 
follow-up data concerning vascular procedures were analyzed.
RESULTS: RAS (diameter reduction >50%) was present in 26%. Forty-six percent of 
study patients underwent a vascular procedure (85% vascular surgery, remainder 
underwent amputation). Patients that underwent vascular surgery had a better 
renal function at baseline, less history of stroke, and a larger proportion of 
smokers. Overall mortality was similar for patients that underwent surgery 
(54.5%) and those without surgery (49.6%). There was no difference in 90-day 
postoperative mortality for patients without or with RAS (7.2% vs 10.3%; NS). 
For subjects that underwent bypass surgery, long-term mortality was 
substantially and significantly higher among those with RAS (65.1%) vs those 
without RAS (43.5%). On Cox regression analysis, age was the only independent 
predictor of 90-day postoperative mortality. The well-known cardiovascular risk 
factors of age, diabetes mellitus, history of prior peripheral vascular disease, 
smoking, prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, and amputation, as well as 
presence of RAS, were independent predictors for overall mortality.
CONCLUSION: In PAD, incidental RAS predicts long-term mortality independent of 
other risk factors. The elevated mortality is not due to a higher postoperative 
risk. Subjects presenting with PAD and RAS can therefore undergo vascular 
procedures with the same risk as other patients.

The world is currently in the midst of the greatest demographic upheaval in 
human history. Dramatic reductions in mortality, followed (but with a lag) by 
equally marked reductions in fertility, resulted in a doubling of world 
population between 1960 and 2000. A further increase of 2 to 4.5 billion is 
projected for the current half-century, with the increase concentrated in the 
world's least developed countries. Despite alarmist predictions, historical 
increases in population have not been economically catastrophic. Moreover, 
changes in population age structure have opened the door to increased 
prosperity. Demographic changes have had and will continue to have profound 
repercussions for human well-being and progress, with some possibilities for 
mediating those repercussions through policy intervention.

Projections of population size, growth rates, and age distribution, although 
extending to distant horizons, shape policies today for the economy, 
environment, and government programs such as public pensions and health care. 
The projections can lead to costly policy adjustments, which in turn can cause 
political and economic turmoil. The United Nations projects global population to 
grow from about 7 billion today to 9.3 billion in 2050 and 10.1 billion in 2100, 
while the Old Age Dependency Ratio doubles by 2050 and triples by 2100. How are 
such population projections made, and how certain can we be about the trends 
they foresee?

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential cost effectiveness of a population-wide 
risk factor reduction programme aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease.
DESIGN: Economic modelling analysis.
SETTING: England and Wales. Population Entire population. Model Spreadsheet 
model to quantify the reduction in cardiovascular disease over a decade, 
assuming the benefits apply consistently for men and women across age and risk 
groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiovascular events avoided, quality adjusted life 
years gained, and savings in healthcare costs for a given effectiveness; 
estimates of how much it would be worth spending to achieve a specific outcome.
RESULTS: A programme across the entire population of England and Wales (about 50 
million people) that reduced cardiovascular events by just 1% would result in 
savings to the health service worth at least £30m (€34m; $48m) a year compared 
with no additional intervention. Reducing mean cholesterol concentrations or 
blood pressure levels in the population by 5% (as already achieved by similar 
interventions in some other countries) would result in annual savings worth at 
least £80m to £100m. Legislation or other measures to reduce dietary salt intake 
by 3 g/day (current mean intake approximately 8.5 g/day) would prevent 
approximately 30,000 cardiovascular events, with savings worth at least £40m a 
year. Legislation to reduce intake of industrial trans fatty acid by 
approximately 0.5% of total energy content might gain around 570,000 life years 
and generate NHS savings worth at least £230m a year.
CONCLUSIONS: Any intervention that achieved even a modest population-wide 
reduction in any major cardiovascular risk factor would produce a net cost 
saving to the NHS, as well as improving health. Given the conservative 
assumptions used in this model, the true benefits would probably be greater.

Drinking water standard for tritium-what's the risk?

Kocher DC(1), Hoffman FO.

Author information:
(1)SENES Oak Ridge, Inc., Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. dck@senes.com

This paper presents an assessment of lifetime risks of cancer incidence 
associated with the drinking water standard for tritium established by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA); this standard is an annual-average 
maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 740 Bq L(-1). This risk assessment has 
several defining characteristics: (1) an accounting of uncertainty in all 
parameters that relate a given concentration of tritium in drinking water to 
lifetime risk (except the number of days of consumption of drinking water in a 
year and the number of years of consumption) and an accounting of correlations 
of uncertain parameters to obtain probability distributions that represent 
uncertainty in estimated lifetime risks of cancer incidence; (2) inclusion of a 
radiation effectiveness factor (REF) to represent an increased biological 
effectiveness of low-energy electrons emitted in decay of tritium compared with 
high-energy photons; (3) use of recent estimates of risks of cancer incidence 
from exposure to high-energy photons, including the dependence of risks on an 
individual's gender and age, in the BEIR VII report; and (4) inclusion of risks 
of incidence of skin cancer, principally basal cell carcinoma. By assuming 
ingestion of tritium in drinking water at the MCL over an average life 
expectancy of 80 y in females and 75 y in males, 95% credibility intervals of 
lifetime risks of cancer incidence obtained in this assessment are (0.35, 12) × 
10(-4) in females and (0.30, 15) × 10(-4) in males. Mean risks, which are 
considered to provide the best single measure of expected risks, are about 3 × 
10(-4) in both genders. In comparison, USEPA's point estimate of the lifetime 
risk of cancer incidence, assuming a daily consumption of drinking water of 2 L 
over an average life expectancy of 75.2 y and excluding an REF for tritium and 
incidence of skin cancer, is 5.6 × 10(-5). Probability distributions of annual 
equivalent doses to the whole body associated with the drinking water standard 
for tritium also were obtained. Means and 97.5th percentiles of maximum annual 
doses to females and males, which occur at age <1 y, all are less than the 
annual equivalent dose of 40 μSv used by USEPA to establish the MCL.

[Live longer, suffer more? Trends in life expectancy and health].

During the 20th century, life expectancy has been continuously increasing with 
the majority of the additional years resulting from decreasing mortality among 
the old and oldest old in the last few decades. Two phases of convergence and 
divergence in European mortality have been identified, with a possible new phase 
of divergence taking place among the oldest old. Over this period, women have 
always been living longer than men. Explanations for this phenomenon include not 
only biological factors and differences in lifestyle and health care 
utilization, but also differences in reporting patterns. Trends in health do not 
follow a clear direction. Reasons are the different dimensions of health as well 
as inadequate data. In general, the prevalence of morbidity has been increasing, 
while functional limitations and ADL disabilities have been decreasing. Due to a 
lack of data, no information exists for trends among the oldest old at age 80 
and above. In absolute terms, the number of healthy years has been increasing 
with increasing life expectancy. In relative terms, they have been stable, 
probably slightly increasing in some countries. These trends suggest that 
increasing life expectancy does not result in an increase in morbidity.

Long-term health impacts of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation inform 
recommendations for follow-up.

Advances in transplantation techniques and supportive care strategies have 
resulted in a significant improvement in survival of those who have undergone 
treatment. However, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors are 
at risk of developing long-term complications, such as endocrinopathies, 
musculoskeletal disorders, cardiopulmonary compromise and subsequent 
malignancies. These complications have a direct impact on the morbidity and 
mortality experienced by HSCT survivors. Two-thirds of HSCT survivors develop at 
least one chronic health condition; while a fifth develop severe or 
life-threatening conditions. HSCT patients who have survived for at least 5 
years post-transplantation are at a fourfold to ninefold increased risk of late 
mortality for as long as 30 years from HSCT, producing an estimated 30% lower 
life expectancy compared with the general population. The high burden of 
morbidity experienced by HSCT survivors makes it critically important that there 
is standardized follow-up of HSCT survivors at high risk for post-HSCT 
complications. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research/European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation/American Society 
for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Children's Oncology Group long-term 
follow-up guidelines offer such standardized care. Future steps include wider 
dissemination and refinement of these guidelines.
