low external oxygen levels caused by soil waterlogging.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corruption 
and population health. Our cross-sectional sample covers 185 countries (54 
high-income and 131 low-income countries) and the period of the analysis is 
2005-2017. This research provides clear evidence that the level of corruption 
significantly affects physical health (expressed as life expectancy and 
Mortality rate) and mental health (expressed by happiness), under the moderating 
role of economic development and cultural framework. Moreover, we validate a 
powerful and positive correlation between the income level and both physical and 
mental health. Culture also has an important role in the corruption-health 
nexus, because we find evidence supporting four out of the six dimensions of 
culture (individualism versus collectivism, indulgence versus restraint, 
uncertainty avoidance and masculinity vs femininity) as having influence upon 
the physical and mental health of individuals. When we estimate the results on 
subsamples of countries (high-income and low-income countries), we validate a 
crisscross effect of corruption. Thus, a high level of corruption more deeply 
affects the physical health of population in low-income countries than in 
high-income countries. On the other hand, mental health is more pronouncedly 
affected by corruption in high-income countries than in low-income countries. 
This study may have important implications for national or international policy 
makers who need to acknowledge that anti-corruption policies play an important 
role in increasing population health, but they also need to adopt them according 
to the economic and cultural context of each nation.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing worldwide as a consequence of 
population aging and increasing chronic illness. Treatment consists mostly of 
dialysis and kidney transplantation (KTx), and KTx offers advantages for life 
expectancy and long-term cost reductions compared with dialysis. This study uses 
the administrative database of the Lombardy Region to analyze the costs of a 
cohort of patients with ESRD receiving KTx, covering a time period of 24 months 
before transplant to 12 months after. During 2011, 276 patients underwent kidney 
transplantation (8.7% preemptive and 91.3% non-preemptive). In the period before 
transplantation, the main cost driver was dialysis (66.6% for the period from 
-24 to -12 months and 73.8% for the period from -12 to 0 months), while in the 
12 months after KTx, the most relevant cost was surgery. The total cost -24 to 
-12 months pre-KTx was 35 049.2€; the cost -12 to 0 months was 36 745.9€; and 
the cost 12 months after KTx was 43 805.8€. Non-preemptive patients showed much 
higher costs both pre- and post-KTx than preemptive patients. This study 
highlights how KTx modifies the resource consumption and costs composition of 
patients with ESRD vs those undergoing dialysis treatment and how KTx may be 
economically beneficial, especially preemptive intervention.

Here, we report an update of the VDJdb database with a substantial increase in 
the number of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences and their cognate antigens. The 
update further provides a new database infrastructure featuring two additional 
analysis modes that facilitate database querying and real-world data analysis. 
The increased yield of TCR specificity identification methods and the overall 
increase in the number of studies in the field has allowed us to expand the 
database more than 5-fold. Furthermore, several new analysis methods are 
included. For example, batch annotation of TCR repertoire sequencing samples 
allows for annotating large datasets on-line. Using recently developed 
bioinformatic methods for TCR motif mining, we have built a reduced set of 
high-quality TCR motifs that can be used for both training TCR specificity 
predictors and matching against TCRs of interest. These additions enhance the 
versatility of the VDJdb in the task of exploring T-cell antigen specificities. 
The database is available at https://vdjdb.cdr3.net.

Online healthcare services are growing rapidly. Patients can receive health 
support through communication with online health professionals. However, 
previous research on eHealth has focused on patients' online behavioral 
intentions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of online 
patient-doctor communication on offline behavioral intentions and to propose a 
conceptual model for eHealth. We integrate fairness theory and band extension 
theory to develop a research model. This is further tested by structural 
equation modeling (SEM), with 279 valid sets of data from patients on the online 
health platform. Using partial least squares analysis (PLS), the results show 
that perceived fairness is an important factor affecting online satisfaction and 
the willingness to ask online doctors, which in turn has a positive impact on 
the willingness to go to offline doctors. These findings shed light on the 
research model for eHealth and offer suggestions for improving patients' online 
satisfaction, as well as both online and offline behavioral intentions.

BACKGROUND: At present, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, are 
widely used in the therapy of advanced non-resectable melanoma, as they induce 
more durable responses than other available treatments. However, the overall 
response rate does not exceed 50% and, considering the high costs and low life 
expectancy of nonresponding patients, there is a need to select potential 
responders before therapy. Our aim was to develop a new personalization 
algorithm which could be beneficial in the clinical setting for predicting time 
to disease progression under pembrolizumab treatment.
METHODS: We developed a simple mathematical model for the interactions of an 
advanced melanoma tumor with both the immune system and the immunotherapy drug, 
pembrolizumab. We implemented the model in an algorithm which, in conjunction 
with clinical pretreatment data, enables prediction of the personal patient 
response to the drug. To develop the algorithm, we retrospectively collected 
clinical data of 54 patients with advanced melanoma, who had been treated by 
pembrolizumab, and correlated personal pretreatment measurements to the 
mathematical model parameters. Using the algorithm together with the 
longitudinal tumor burden of each patient, we identified the personal 
mathematical models, and simulated them to predict the patient's time to 
progression. We validated the prediction capacity of the algorithm by the 
Leave-One-Out cross-validation methodology.
RESULTS: Among the analyzed clinical parameters, the baseline tumor load, the 
Breslow tumor thickness, and the status of nodular melanoma were significantly 
correlated with the activation rate of CD8+ T cells and the net tumor growth 
rate. Using the measurements of these correlates to personalize the mathematical 
model, we predicted the time to progression of individual patients (Cohen's 
κ = 0.489). Comparison of the predicted and the clinical time to progression in 
patients progressing during the follow-up period showed moderate accuracy 
(R2 = 0.505).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that a relatively simple 
mathematical mechanistic model, implemented in a personalization algorithm, can 
be personalized by clinical data, evaluated before immunotherapy onset. The 
algorithm, currently yielding moderately accurate predictions of individual 
patients' response to pembrolizumab, can be improved by training on a larger 
number of patients. Algorithm validation by an independent clinical dataset will 
enable its use as a tool for treatment personalization.

BACKGROUND: Nonunion is a quite common complication of open tibial shaft 
fractures. This prospective case series investigates the use of the 
gentamicin-coated titanium intramedullary tibial nail, in association with the 
RIA system, in patients with tibial exposed nonunions.
METHODS: Between January 2015 and January 2018, patients meeting the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were recruited.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients aged 18 or more; non-union after an open tibial 
shaft fracture; previous treatment with a circular external fixator.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: a known allergy to aminoglycosides; pin tract infections; 
persistent soft-tissues damage; patients pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to 
become pregnant during the study; history of malignant disease; a life 
expectancy of fewer than three months; medical illness or cognitive disorders 
precluding participation in the follow-up examination. All the patients 
underwent a clinical and radiological follow-up at one-, three-, six- and 
twelve-months post-operatively. Clinical evaluation was performed using the 
following validated scores: Euro-Quality 5 D (EQ-5D); American Orthopedic Foot & 
Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
for pain.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (male: 11; 
female: 6; mean age: 41.12 ± 11.4). Fracture healing was observed in all the 
patients; the mean time needed to obtain the fracture healing was 7.18 months. A 
significant improvement of the quality of life, evaluated with the EQ-5D, and of 
the mean VAS for pain was observed from the three-months follow-up. The mean 
AOFAS score showed a significant increase at six-months follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of gentamicin-coated nails in association with the RIA 
system demonstrated a safe and effective treatment of tibial non-unions.

Pseudosuccinea columella snails transmit the trematode Fasciola hepatica, but in 
Cuba, six naturally occurring populations successfully resist parasite 
infection. Here, we present an updated distribution of P. columella in Cuba; 68 
positive sites with the earliest records more abundant in west-central Cuba and 
with east-central populations generally corresponding to the newest samples. No 
records were found farther east. The IPA site reported 10.5% prevalence of F. 
hepatica-infected snails. Population genetics, studied through microsatellites, 
showed low allelic and multilocus genotypic richness (MLGT), mainly in 
susceptible populations, strong deviations from panmixia and high 
self-fertilization rates. Susceptible individuals were grouped in one major 
cluster containing the majority of MLGT, and two independent clusters grouped 
the MLGT of resistant individuals from western and central populations, 
respectively. From these, we propose that several introductions of P. columella 
occurred in Cuba, primarily in the west, with the early arrivals deriving on the 
resistant populations. A more recent introduction of susceptible P. columella 
carrying MLGT T and Y may have occurred, where the latter spread quickly through 
the island and possibly increase the risk of parasite transmission in Cuba since 
all snails naturally infected with F. hepatica were carriers of the MLGT Y. 
Interestingly, even though resistant populations are highly diverse and are 
likely the oldest within Cuba, they are only found in six localities 
characterized by soft (total hardness, TH = 6.3 ± 1.03°d) and slightly acidic 
(pH = 6.2 ± 0.12) waters with low richness in snail species (3.2 ± 1.02). This 
tendency was also observed in a two-year follow-up ecological study that was 
conducted on a farm where both phenotypes occurred in sympatry; colonization 
events by resistant over susceptible snails coincided with a reduction in the pH 
and TH of the water. A comparison of life traits in susceptible and resistant 
isolates reared at two different pH/TH conditions (5.9/4°d or 7.8/14°d) showed 
that low pH/TH negatively affects P. columella, irrespective of the phenotype. 
However, evidence of higher tolerance (higher survival, life expectancy, egg 
viability) to such conditions was observed in resistant isolates. Finally, we 
speculate that the limited distribution of resistant populations might be 
related to a better exploitation of sites that are less suitable to snails 
(thus, with lower competition), rather than to a differential ecological 
restriction to specific environmental conditions from susceptible P. columella.

BACKGROUND: We estimated the average numbers of years lived with and without 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in normal weight, overweight, and obese 
individuals, aged ≥30 years.
METHODS: A total of 7529 participants were recruited. The multi-state Markov 
model was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) for three transitions (CVD free to 
nonfatal CVD, CVD free to all-cause death, and nonfatal CVD to all-cause death) 
stratified by body mass index (BMI) categories at baseline and adjusted for 
confounders including sex, age, smoking, family history of premature CVD, 
education and physical activity. Life expectancies (LEs) were also estimated for 
each transition stratifying by BMI categories and sex.
RESULTS: We found 986 incident cases of nonfatal CVD and 669 overall deaths (236 
CVD deaths) after more than 18 years of follow-up. Overweight and obesity were 
associated with an increased risk of nonfatal CVD (HR, 1.42 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.21-1.66) and (1.64, 1.37-1.96), respectively), compared with 
normal weight individuals. Overweight and obesity were also associated with 
lower risk of mortality without CVD (0.39, 0.20-0.77) and (0.35, 0.14-0.85), 
respectively. Among those with CVD, overweight compared with normal weight was 
associated with a lower risk of mortality (0.72, 0.56-0.94). Total LEs for both 
men and women with overweight and obesity were not significantly different from 
their normal weight counterparts. Compared with normal weight individuals, men 
and women with obesity lived 4.1 (CI: -6.3, -1.3) and 4.3 (-6.4, -2.0) fewer 
years free of CVD; however, they lived 3.9 (2.1, 6.0) and 3.7 (2.1, 5.6) longer 
years with CVD than their normal weight counterparts, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that although total LE was not influenced by higher 
BMI; individuals with overweight and obesity could expect longer longevity after 
diagnosis of nonfatal CVD. These extra years of life impose financial burden on 
both patients and the health care system.

BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing life expectancy in our society, 
aging-related neurodegenerative disorders are one of the main issues in global 
health. Most of these diseases are characterized by the deposition of misfolded 
proteins and a progressive cognitive decline. Among these diseases, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the most common types of 
degenerative dementia. Although both show specific features, an important 
neuropathological and clinical overlap between them hampers their correct 
diagnosis. In this work, we identified molecular biomarkers aiming to improve 
the misdiagnosis between both diseases.
METHODS: Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) -from DLB, AD and healthy controls- 
were isolated using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by 
flow cytometry, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and cryo-electron 
microscopy. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and related bibliographic search 
was performed and a selected group of EV-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) was 
analysed by qPCR.
RESULTS: Results uncovered two miRNAs (hsa-miR-451a and hsa-miR-21-5p) 
significantly down-regulated in AD samples respect to DLB patients, and a set of 
four miRNAs (hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-let-7i-5p, and hsa-miR-151a-3p) 
significantly decreased in AD respect to controls. The two miRNAs showing 
decreased expression in AD in comparison to DLB provided area under the curve 
(AUC) values of 0.9 in ROC curve analysis, thus suggesting their possible use as 
biomarkers to discriminate between both diseases. Target gene analysis of these 
miRNAs using prediction online tools showed accumulation of phosphorylation 
enzymes, presence of proteasome-related proteins and genes involved in cell 
death among others.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that plasma-EV associated miRNAs may reflect a 
differential profile for a given dementia-related disorder which, once validated 
in larger cohorts of patients, could help to improve the differential diagnosis 
of DLB versus AD.

The composition and diversity of the human vaginal microbial community have been 
investigated intensively due to the diversity-stability relationship (DSR)-based 
hypothesis for bacterial vaginosis (BV) etiology, which was first proposed in 
the 1990s and has received renewed interest in recent years. Nevertheless, 
diversity changes (scaling) across individuals in a cohort or population have 
not yet been addressed, which is significant both theoretically and practically. 
Theoretically, biodiversity scaling is the core of biogeography, and 
practically, inter-subject heterogeneity is critical for understanding the 
etiology and epidemiology of human microbiome-associated diseases such as BV. 
Here we applied the diversity-area relationship (DAR), a recent extension to the 
classic species-area relationship (SAR), to study diversity scaling of the 
vaginal microbiome by reanalyzing reported data collected from 1 107 postpartum 
women. The model used here characterized the power-law (or its extension) 
relationships between accrued diversity and areas (numbers of individuals), upon 
which four biogeographic profiles were thus defined. Specifically, we 
established the DAR profile (relationship between diversity scaling parameter 
and so-termed diversity order (q)), similarly pair-wise diversity overlap (PDO) 
profile, maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile, and ratio of individual-level 
to population-level diversity (RIP) profile. These four profiles offer valuable 
tools to assess and predict diversity scaling (changes) in the human vaginal 
microbiome across individuals, as well as to understand the dynamics of vaginal 
microbiomes in healthy women.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) in conjunction with 
anticoagulation therapy is increasingly used with the goal of preventing 
postthrombotic syndrome. Long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of these 2 
treatment strategies from the perspective of the US healthcare system have not 
been compared.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2014, the ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous 
Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) 
randomized 692 patients with acute proximal DVT to PCDT plus anticoagulation 
(n=337) or standard treatment with anticoagulation alone (n=355). Costs (2017 US 
dollars) were assessed over a 24-month follow-up period using a combination of 
resource-based costing, hospital bills, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the 
Drug Topics Red Book. Health state utilities were obtained from the Short 
Form-36. In-trial results and US life tables were used to develop a Markov 
cohort model to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness. For the PCDT group, mean 
costs of the initial procedure were $13 600; per-patient costs associated with 
the index hospitalization were $21 509 for PCDT and $3877 for standard care 
(difference=$17 632; 95% CI, $16 117-$19 243). The 24-month difference in costs 
was $20 045 (95% CI, $16 093-$24 120). Utility scores increased significantly 
between baseline and 6 months for both groups, with no significant differences 
between groups at any follow-up time point. Projected differences in lifetime 
costs of $16 740 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.08, yield an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCDT of $222 041/QALY gained. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PCDT would achieve a 
lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/QALY or <$150 000/QALY 
was 1% and 25%, respectively. For iliofemoral DVT, QALY gains with PCDT were 
greater, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $137 526/QALY; for 
femoral-popliteal DVT, standard therapy was an economically dominant strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$200 000/QALY gained, 
PCDT is not an economically attractive treatment for proximal DVT. PCDT may be 
of intermediate value in patients with iliofemoral DVT. Clinical Trial

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention to 
treat depressive disorders in youth. However, 50% of adolescents still have 
depressive symptoms after treatment, and 57% drop out during treatment. Online 
CBT interventions have proven to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms 
and seem promising as a treatment for depressed adolescents. However, combining 
online programs with face-to-face sessions seems necessary to increase their 
effectiveness and monitor for suicide risk.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
a blended CBT treatment protocol, a mixture of online and face-to-face CBT, as a 
treatment for clinically depressed adolescents.
METHODS: A pragmatic quasi-experimental controlled trial will be conducted to 
study the effectiveness of a blended CBT treatment protocol, in which blended 
CBT is compared with face-to-face CBT (n=44) and treatment as usual (n=44); the 
latter two were collected in a previous randomized controlled trial. The same 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used: adolescents aged between 12 and 
21 years, with a clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder, and referred to 
one of the participating mental health institutions. Assessments will be 
conducted at the same time points: before the start of the intervention, during 
the intervention (after 5 and 10 weeks), postintervention, and at 6- and 
12-month follow-ups.
RESULTS: The primary outcome is the presence of a depression diagnosis at 
12-month follow-up. Several secondary outcomes will be measured, such as 
depressive symptoms, quality of life, and suicide risk. Costs and effects in 
both conditions will be compared to analyze cost-effectiveness. Further, 
moderating (age, gender, alcohol and drug use, parental depression, and other 
psychopathology) and mediating effects (negative automatic thoughts, cognitive 
emotion regulation, attributional style) will be analyzed. Also, treatment 
characteristics will be studied, such as characteristics of the therapists, 
treatment expectancy, and therapeutic alliance. Dropout rates and treatment 
characteristics will be measured to study the feasibility of blended CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
a blended CBT program in which depressed adolescents are treated in mental 
health care. Results of blended CBT will be compared with face-to-face CBT and 
treatment as usual, and implications for implementation will be reviewed.

Pancreatic cysts are common and often incidentally detected on abdominal 
imaging. Their prevalence in asymptomatic individuals depends on the screening 
modality used. The incidence of these lesions increases with age and may be 
detected in nearly half of elderly patients undergoing high-resolution magnetic 
resonance imaging. Some, but not all, pancreas cysts have malignant potential. 
The overall risk is small but induces significant anxiety for the patient. When 
determining management options, it is important to consider the patient's age, 
medical comorbidities, and surgical risks as well as the wishes of the patient. 
Current strategies include imaging surveillance or surgical resection. Before 
embarking on cyst surveillance, a clinician must factor in patients' risk of 
developing malignancy, their life expectancy, medical comorbidities, and if they 
are a surgical candidate. Surgery poses significant adverse events and 
mortality, whereas radiographic surveillance imposes healthcare costs and 
psychological distress to patients with the looming possibility of malignancy. 
The development and use of endoscopic ultrasound cyst ablation is a minimally 
invasive alternative in treating pancreatic cystic lesions. This review focuses 
on the modalities of ethanol ablation, paclitaxel ablation, and radiofrequency 
ablation of pancreatic cystic lesions.

Objective: To analyze the disease burden of pancreatic cancer in China in 1990 
and 2017. Methods: Province-specific data in China from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2017 were used to describe the change of death status, 
disease burden of pancreatic cancer in Chinese population by specific province 
and age groups, including incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY), years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and years lived with 
disability (YLD) in 1990 and 2017. Meanwhile the incidence, mortality, DALY 
rate, YLL rate, YLD rate were standardized by the GBD global standard population 
in 2017. Results: In 2017, the new cases of pancreatic cancer, incidence and 
age-standardized incidence accounted for 83.6 thousand, 5.92/100 000 and 
4.37/100 000 in China, with an increase of 230.94%, 180.45% and 49.88% compared 
with 1990, respectively. The total number of deaths, mortality and 
age-standardized mortality appeared as 85.1 thousand, 6.02/100 000, 4.48/100 
000, with an increase of 236.08%, 184.80% and 47.51% respectively. The incidence 
and mortality of pancreatic cancer increased with age and accelerated from the 
age of 55 to 59 both in 1990 and 2017. The highest incidence and mortality 
showed in 85-89 years old in 2017 and in 90-94 years old in 1990. The 
standardized DALY rate of pancreatic cancer increased from 71.00/100 000 in 1990 
to 94.32/100 000 in 2017, increased by 32.84%. The standardized YLL rate 
increased from 70.39/100 000 to 93.42/100 000, increased by 32.72%. The 
standardized YLD rate increased from 0.62/100 000 to 0.90/100 000, increased by 
45.80%. In terms of age distribution, DALY rate, YLL rate and YLD rate of 
pancreatic cancer basically showed an increasing trend with age in 1990 and 
2017. In 2017, Jiangsu (7.61/100 000), Shanghai (7.52/100 000) and Liaoning 
(6.84/100 000) ranked the top three provinces in terms of standardized 
mortality. Compared with 1990, Henan (104.28%), Sichuan (94.02%) and Hebei 
(90.39%) saw the fastest increase in standardized mortality. Conclusions: The 
incidence, mortality and disease burden of pancreatic cancer in China increased 
significantly from 1990 to 2017. Prevention and control measures should be 
strengthened to reduce the disease burden of pancreatic cancer.

Objective: To analyze the disease burden of stroke and its health loss 
attributable to passive smoking in people aged 60 years and over in Jiangsu 
province. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Chronic and Non-communicable 
Diseases and Risk Factors Surveillance in Jiangsu in 2013 and the death registry 
system in Jiangsu. Combined with the method in Global Burden of Disease Study 
2016 (GBD2016), the indicators, such as population attributable fraction (PAF) 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for stroke due to passive smoking were 
calculated. Results: In 2013, the mortality rate, age-standardized mortality 
rate, DALY and DALY rate of stroke in people aged 60 years and over in Jiangsu 
were 718.15/100 000, 439.28/100 000, 1 179 602 person years and 9 234.99/100 
000, respectively. Year of life lost (YLL) accounted for 87.00% of the total 
DALY. The DALY and corresponding rate of stroke increased rapidly with age, and 
were higher in women (612 084 person years and 9 319.71/100 000, respectively) 
than those in men (567 518 person years and 9 145.33/100 000, respectively). The 
prevalence of passive smoking was 34.04% in people aged 60 years and over in 
Jiangsu. The PAF, attributable DALY, attributable DALY rate and its age- 
standardized rate of stroke due to passive smoking in people aged 60 years and 
over in Jiangsu were 3.88%, 45 769 person years, 358.12/100 000 and 920.64/100 
000, respectively; and were also higher for men (4.35%, 24 687 person years, 
397.82/100 000 and 515.30/100 000, respectively) than those for women (3.44%, 21 
056 person years, 320.60/100 000, 405.34/100 000, respectively). Conclusions: 
The disease burden of stroke was heavy in the elderly in Jiangsu, and passive 
smoking might have great influence on the disease burden of stroke. Prevention 
and control of stroke and passive smoking exposure should be taken actively to 
improve health for the elderly.

234.99/10万，其中过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）占总DALY的87.00%。脑卒中DALY和DALY率随年龄的增长而升高，而且女性DALY（612 
084人年）和DALY率（9 319.71/10万）均高于男性（567 518人年、9 
145.33/10万）。江苏省≥60岁人群被动吸烟率为34.04%，PAF、归因DALY、归因DALY率和标化归因DALY率分别为3.88%、45 
769人年、358.12/10万和920.64/10万，其中男性分别为4.35%、24 
687万人年、397.82/10万、515.30/10万，均高于女性（分别为3.44%、21 056人年、320.60/10万、405.34/10万）。 结论： 
江苏省老年人群脑卒中疾病负担沉重，其中被动吸烟对脑卒中疾病负担产生较大影响，应积极采取措施，推进脑卒中防控和二手烟暴露控制工作，提高人们的健康水平。.

BACKGROUND: Spinal metastases are being diagnosed more frequently because of 
increasing life expectancies and advances in the diagnosis and therapy of 
primary tumours.
OBJECTIVE: This aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and 
functional outcomes after surgical intervention for spinal metastases in a large 
cohort.
METHODS: A single-centre, prospective, observational study was conducted from 
June 2016 to February 2018. Patients treated surgically for spinal metastasis 
were included. Primary endpoints were the Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI), 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and QoL questionnaire (EuroQoL-5D) scores 
recorded preoperatively, 6 weeks postoperatively, and 3, 6, and 12 months 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (mean age, 62.7 ± 12.8 years) were included. The 
most frequent neoplasms were multiple myeloma (n= 18; 19.6%), lung cancer (n= 
16; 17.4%), prostate cancer (n= 14; 15.2%), and breast cancer (n= 11; 12.0%). 
During the observation period, 44.6% of patients died. The COMI score improved 
significantly from preoperatively (mean, 7.1; 95% CI, 6.6-7.6) to 3 months 
(mean, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.8-6.2; p= 0.01) and 12 months (mean, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.7-5.5; 
p= 0.001) postoperatively. The ODI showed a significant improvement from 
preoperatively (mean, 52.9; 95% CI, 48.5-57.4) to 6 weeks (mean, 43.4; 95% CI, 
37.1-49.6; p= 0.03), 3 months (mean, 37.0; 95% CI, 31.0-42.9) 6 months mean, 
40.5; 95% CI, 34.2-46.8; p= 0.01), and 12 months (mean, 31.9; 95% CI, 24.8-39.1; 
p= 0.005) postoperatively. Improvements in the COMI at 6 weeks (p= 0.05), and 6 
months (p= 0.05) postoperatively were not statistically significant. QoL 
improved from preoperatively to 6 weeks (mean, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.59; p= 
0.002), 3 months (mean, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38-0.61; p= 0.009), and 12 months (mean, 
0.61; 95% CI, 0.51-0.71; p= 0.001) postoperatively. After 6 months, the 
difference was not significant (p= 0.08).
CONCLUSION: Short-term and long-term improvements in functional outcomes and QoL 
were observed after surgical treatment of spinal metastases. Surgery is a good 
option for patients with an estimated life expectancy of more than 3 months.
