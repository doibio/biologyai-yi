CONCLUSION: The cementless TEA seems to be a reliable option for treatment of 
varying elbow diseases. Long-term results are needed to assess the survivorship 
of this design.

OBJECTIVES: The Council of the European Union (EU) has recommended that action 
should be taken to increase influenza vaccination in the elderly population. The 
aims were to systematically review and critically appraise economic evaluations 
for influenza vaccination in the elderly population in the EU.
METHODS: Electronic searches of the NHS Economic Evaluation, Health Technology 
Assessment, MEDLINE and Embase databases were run to identify full economic 
evaluations. Two levels of screening were used, with explicit inclusion criteria 
applied by two independent reviewers at each stage. Prespecified data extraction 
and critical appraisal were performed on identified studies. Results were 
summarised qualitatively.
RESULTS: Of the 326 search results, screening identified eight relevant studies. 
Results varied widely, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging 
from being both more effective and cheaper than no intervention to costing 
€4 59 350 per life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to 
variations in influenza strain, vaccination type and strategy, population and 
modelling characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies suggest that vaccination is cost-effective (seven of 
eight studies identified at least one cost-effective scenario). All but one 
study used economic models to synthesise data from different sources. The 
results are uncertain due to the methods used and the relevance and robustness 
of the data used. Sensitivity analysis to explore these aspects was limited. 
Integrated, controlled prospective clinical and economic evaluations and 
surveillance data are needed to improve the evidence base. This would allow more 
advanced modelling techniques to characterise the epidemiology of influenza more 
accurately and improve the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates.

Hospital, Florence, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in Italy from 
a third-party payer perspective over a medium-term (10 years) and a long-term 
(lifetime) horizon.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed, in which patients may 
experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, 
cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities 
were obtained from the Italian and international literature. Three types of 
surgeries were considered: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable 
gastric banding. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the 
characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Italy.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to cost 
increment of EUR 2,661 and generated additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of EUR 8,649, additional 0.5 
life years and 3.2 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 2,412/QALY and dominant over 
conservative management over a lifetime.
CONCLUSION: In a comprehensive decision analytic model, a current mix of 
surgical methods for bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years and 
cost-saving over the lifetime of the Italian patient cohort considered in this 
analysis.

Obesity is associated with a reduced life expectancy, largely because obese 
individuals are at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
and several types of cancer. Much interest has recently focused on the concept 
of "all obesity is not created equally." Obese individuals without the metabolic 
abnormalities that commonly accompany excess adiposity, a condition known as 
metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), account for a substantial proportion of the 
obese adult population. Numerous possible mechanisms underlying MHO have been 
suggested, including adipose tissue distribution and inflammation. However, the 
prognostic value of MHO is controversial and considerably challenging. The lack 
of a standard definition for metabolic health and obesity as well as the dynamic 
properties of MHO may have contributed to these inconsistent results. This 
review aimed to present several current issues regarding MHO including its 
definition, epidemiology, natural course, suggested mechanisms, and clinical 
implications in the context of patient prognosis.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an increasing problem in the elderly that 
is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. Given the expected 
increased life expectancy, this problem is only likely to worsen, so it has been 
considered that treatment effects must be examined separately in elderly adults 
with CAP. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we give an update of the 
available data of antibiotics for elderly patients with CAP. Clinical features, 
drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, adverse effects, and outcomes differ 
in CAP depending on patient age. Older age, for example, can affect the effect 
of specific antibiotic regimens on important CAP clinical outcomes. Current 
guidelines do not offer specific recommendations for the management of CAP in 
elderly patients. Expert opinion: Most of our knowledge about the treatment of 
CAP in elderly patients has been gained from studies in young populations. 
However, elderly patients with CAP deserve special attention because there are 
several factors in this population that could influence their response to 
antibiotic regimens in CAP.

Cancer is a disorder which has noted a significant rise in incidence worldwide 
and continues to be the largest cause of mortality. It has a dramatic impact on 
human life expectancy and quality of life in spite of the increase in technology 
and the treatments available for cancer patients. These new therapeutic options 
being chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photolytic therapy and catalytic therapy are 
known to have many adverse reactions and also no better positive outcomes than 
before. Hence, research is now focused more on utilizing the vast repertoire of 
traditional medicinal knowledge i.e. the use of flora for treatment of cancer 
rather than the use of chemicals. One such herb is the Crocus sativus L., 
commonly known as Saffron, rich in carotenoids - crocin, crocetin and safranal. 
Various studies have been carried out over the past few years to confirm the 
anti-cancer properties of saffron, both in vivo using animal models and in vitro 
using human malignant cell lines on various types of cancers with positive 
results. The proposed mechanism of actions has also been worked upon. This 
review is aimed to provide a brief overview on the anti-tumor potential of 
saffron focusing on the molecular mechanism involved.

BACKGROUND: Although needle decompression of tension pneumothorax through the 
second intercostal space in the midclavicular line (Monaldi's approach) is a 
life-saving procedure, severe complications have been reported after its 
implementation. We evaluated the procedure by comparing how it was performed on 
cadavers by study participants with different training levels.
METHODS: Six participants including one thoracic surgeon performed bilateral 
thoracic drainage after Monaldi on 82 torsos. After the thoraces were opened, 
the distances from the internal thoracic artery (A), the site of the puncture 
(B) and the midclavicular line (C) were measured bilaterally with reference to 
the median of the sternum. Further, it was determined whether the participants 
had correctly identified the second intercostal space. The differences between 
B-A and C-B were analysed.
RESULTS: The needle was placed in the second intercostal space in 136 
hemithoraces (83%). The thoracic surgeon showed a hit rate of 0% laceration of 
adjacent vessels. All the other participants had hit rates between 10% and 15%. 
The interval B-A ranged from 2.88 to 5.06cm in right and from 3.00 to 5.00cm in 
left hemithoraces. The distance C-B lay between 1.03cm and 1.87cm (right side), 
and 0.84cm and 2.02cm (left side).
CONCLUSION: In our collective, the main problem was failure to assess correctly 
the lateral extension of the clavicle. If this fact is emphasized during 
training, Monaldi's approach is a safe method for needle decompression of 
pneumothorax.

BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterised 
by splenomegaly, cytopenias, bone marrow fibrosis, and debilitating symptoms 
including fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain. Mutations in Janus kinase-2 
(JAK2) occur in approximately 50% of patients. The only approved JAK2 inhibitor 
for myelofibrosis is the dual JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. 58-71% of 
patients treated with ruxolitinib in clinical trials so far have not achieved 
the primary endpoint of 35% or more reduction in spleen volume from baseline 
assessed by MRI or CT. Furthermore, more than 50% of patients discontinue 
ruxolitinib treatment after 3-5 years. On the basis of this unmet need, we 
investigated the efficacy and safety of fedratinib, a JAK2-selective inhibitor, 
in patients with ruxolitinib-resistant or ruxolitinib-intolerant myelofibrosis.
METHODS: This single-arm, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2, multicentre 
study, done at 31 sites in nine countries, enrolled adult patients with a 
current diagnosis of intermediate or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, 
post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythaemia 
myelofibrosis, found to be ruxolitinib resistant or intolerant after at least 14 
days of treatment. Other main inclusion criteria were palpable splenomegaly (≥5 
cm below the left costal margin), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 2 or less, and life expectancy of 6 months or less. Patients received 
oral fedratinib at a starting dose of 400 mg once per day, for six consecutive 
28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was spleen response (defined as the 
proportion of patients with a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume as determined by 
blinded CT and MRI at a central imaging laboratory). We did the primary analysis 
in the per-protocol population only (patients treated with fedratinib, for whom 
a baseline and at least one post-baseline spleen volume measurement was 
available) and the safety analysis in all patients receiving at least one dose 
of fedratinib. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01523171.
FINDINGS: Between May 8, 2012, and Aug 29, 2013, 97 patients were enrolled and 
received at least one dose of fedratinib. Of 83 assessable patients, 46 (55%, 
95% CI 44-66) achieved a spleen response. Common grade 3-4 adverse events 
included anaemia (37 [38%] of 97 patients) and thrombocytopenia (21 [22%] of 
97), with 18 (19%) patients discontinuing due to adverse events. Seven (7%) 
patients died during the study, but none of the deaths was drug related. 
Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy in other fedratinib trials led to 
study termination.
INTERPRETATION: This phase 2 study met its primary endpoint, suggesting that 
patients with ruxolitinib-resistant or ruxolitinib-intolerant myelofibrosis 
might achieve significant clinical benefit with fedratinib, albeit at the cost 
of some potential toxicity, which requires further evaluation. Fedratinib 
development in this setting is currently being assessed.

Nutrients-and by extension biosynthetic capacity-positively impact cell size in 
organisms throughout the tree of life. In bacteria, cell size is reduced 3-fold 
in response to nutrient starvation or accumulation of the alarmone ppGpp, a 
global inhibitor of biosynthesis. However, whether biosynthetic capacity as a 
whole determines cell size or whether particular anabolic pathways are more 
important than others remains an open question. Here we identify fatty acid 
synthesis as the primary biosynthetic determinant of Escherichia coli size and 
present evidence supporting a similar role for fatty acids as a positive 
determinant of size in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the 
single-celled eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Altering fatty acid synthesis 
recapitulated the impact of altering nutrients on cell size and morphology, 
whereas defects in other biosynthetic pathways had either a negligible or 
fatty-acid-dependent effect on size. Together, our findings support a novel 
"outside-in" model in which fatty acid availability sets cell envelope capacity, 
which in turn dictates cell size. In the absence of ppGpp, limiting fatty acid 
synthesis leads to cell lysis, supporting a role for ppGpp as a linchpin linking 
expansion of cytoplasmic volume to the growth of the cell envelope to preserve 
cellular integrity.

BACKGROUND: Ceritinib is a next-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
inhibitor, which has shown robust anti-tumour efficacy, along with intracranial 
activity, in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer. In phase 1 
and 2 studies, ceritinib has been shown to be highly active in both ALK 
inhibitor-naive and ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients who had progressed after 
chemotherapy (mostly multiple lines). In this study, we compared the efficacy 
and safety of ceritinib versus single-agent chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer who had previously progressed 
following crizotinib and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.
METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited 
patients aged at least 18 years with ALK-rearranged stage IIIB or IV 
non-small-cell lung cancer (with at least one measurable lesion) who had 
received previous chemotherapy (one or two lines, including a platinum doublet) 
and crizotinib and had subsequent disease progression, from 99 centres across 20 
countries. Other inclusion criteria were a WHO performance status of 0-2, 
adequate organ function and laboratory test results, a life expectancy of at 
least 12 weeks, and having recovered from previous anticancer treatment-related 
toxicities. We randomly allocated patients (1:1; with blocking [block size of 
four]; stratified by WHO performance status [0 vs 1-2] and presence or absence 
of brain metastases) to oral ceritinib 750 mg per day fasted (in 21 day 
treatment cycles) or chemotherapy (intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or docetaxel 
75 mg/m2 [investigator choice], every 21 days). Patients who discontinued 
chemotherapy because of progressive disease could cross over to the ceritinib 
group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed by a masked 
independent review committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
1.1 in the intention-to-treat population, assessed every 6 weeks until month 18 
and every 9 weeks thereafter. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01828112, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.
FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2013, and Nov 2, 2015, we randomly allocated 231 
patients; 115 (50%) to ceritinib and 116 (50%) to chemotherapy (40 [34%] to 
pemetrexed, 73 [63%] to docetaxel, and three [3%] discontinued before receiving 
treatment). Median follow-up was 16·5 months (IQR 11·5-21·4). Ceritinib showed a 
significant improvement in median progression-free survival compared with 
chemotherapy (5·4 months [95% CI 4·1-6·9] for ceritinib vs 1·6 months [1·4-2·8] 
for chemotherapy; hazard ratio 0·49 [0·36-0·67]; p<0·0001). Serious adverse 
events were reported in 49 (43%) of 115 patients in the ceritinib group and 36 
(32%) of 113 in the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events 
were similar between groups (13 [11%] in the ceritinib group vs 12 [11%] in the 
chemotherapy group). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events in the ceritinib 
group were increased alanine aminotransferase concentration (24 [21%] of 115 vs 
two [2%] of 113 in the chemotherapy group), increased γ glutamyltransferase 
concentration (24 [21%] vs one [1%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase 
concentration (16 [14%] vs one [1%] in the chemotherapy group). Six (5%) of 115 
patients in the ceritinib group discontinued because of adverse events compared 
with eight (7%) of 116 in the chemotherapy group. 15 (13%) of 115 patients in 
the ceritinib group and five (4%) of 113 in the chemotherapy group died during 
the treatment period (from the day of the first dose of study treatment to 30 
days after the final dose). 13 (87%) of the 15 patients who died in the 
ceritinib group died because of disease progression and two (13%) died because 
of an adverse event (one [7%] cerebrovascular accident and one [7%] respiratory 
failure); neither of these deaths were considered by the investigator to be 
treatment related. The five (4%) deaths in the chemotherapy group were all due 
to disease progression.
INTERPRETATION: These findings show that patients derive significant clinical 
benefit from a more potent ALK inhibitor after failure of crizotinib, and 
establish ceritinib as a more efficacious treatment option compared with 
chemotherapy in this patient population.

[Purpose] The study aimed to investigate the effects of daily living 
occupational therapy and resistance exercise on the performance of activities of 
daily living and muscular fitness in a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
[Subject and Methods] A 35-year-old man was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré 
syndrome. He was hospitalized at A Hospital for 3 years, and was discharged from 
the hospital after he became able to execute daily life activities. After 
discharge, he performed daily occupational therapy and resistance exercise twice 
a week for 70 minutes per session for 12 weeks. Performance in the activities of 
daily living was assessed using the modified Barthel index, and muscular fitness 
was measured in terms of isokinetic muscular function using the Biodes system. 
[Results] The subject's Barthel index score improved from 54 points before the 
intervention to 62 points after 4 weeks, 69 points after 8 weeks, and 79 points 
after 12 weeks. In addition, his shoulder flexion and extension, knee flexion 
and extension, and lumbar flexion and extension were improved. [Conclusion] The 
present study suggests that daily living occupational therapy and resistance 
exercise are effective in improving the activities of daily living and muscular 
fitness in a patient recovering from Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Factors Influencing Decision Making for Carotid Endarterectomy versus Stenting 
in the Very Elderly.

United States.

As the population ages worldwide, the number of elderly patients with carotid 
stenosis is also increasing. There have been many large clinical trials 
comparing carotid endarterectomy (CAE) versus stenting, but the inclusion 
criteria (i.e., symptomatic or asymptomatic), stenting methods (i.e., protection 
device), and primary end point (i.e., the definition of myocardial infarction 
and follow-up period) were different between trials. Therefore, the 
interpretation of those results is difficult and requires attention. When it 
comes to age, the patients older than 80 years were excluded or stratified to a 
high risk group in previous landmark trials. However, a recent guideline 
recommended that endarterectomy may be associated with lower stroke risk 
compared with carotid artery stenting in patients older than 70 years with 
symptomatic carotid disease. The annual risk of stroke in individuals with 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis is about 1-3% but the risk is about 4-12% with 
symptomatic stenosis without carotid intervention. Although the outcome of CAE 
is better than that of carotid stenting in patients older than 70 years, the 
perioperative risk is higher in older patients. Therefore, it is important to 
classify high risk patients and consider underlying disability and life 
expectancy of very elderly patients before deciding whether to undergo a carotid 
intervention. In addition, we should also consider that the stroke rate with 
intensive medical treatment is unknown and is currently being investigated in 
randomized controlled trials. Intensive medical treatment includes high 
intensity statins, diabetes and blood pressure control, and aggressive 
antiplatelet treatment. The aim of this review is to report the factors that may 
be responsible for the variability in the treatment of carotid stenosis, 
particularly in the elderly population. This will allow the readers to integrate 
the current available evidence to individualize the treatment of carotid 
stenosis in this challenging population.

Author information:
(1)1 The Vitality Group, New York, NY, USA.
(2)2 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Recent improvements in life expectancy globally require intensified 
focus on noncommunicable diseases and age-related conditions. The purpose of 
this article is to inform the development of age-specific prevention guidelines 
for adults aged 50 and above, which are currently lacking.
DATA SOURCE: PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and explicit outreach 
to experts in the field.
STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Meta-analyses, intervention-based, and 
prospective cohort studies that reported all-cause mortality, disease-specific 
mortality, or morbidity in adults were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review was undertaken in 2015 using search terms 
of a combination of <risk factor> and "intervention," "mortality," "reduction," 
"improvement," "death," and "morbidity."
DATA SYNTHESIS: Interventions were categorized according to the Center for 
Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence framework.
RESULTS: A summary table reports for each intervention the impact, strength of 
evidence, initiation, duration, and details of the intervention. 
Age-decade-specific preventive recommendations have been proposed relating to 
physical activity, diet, tobacco and alcohol use, medication adherence, 
screening and vaccination, and mental and cognitive health.
CONCLUSION: Clear recommendations have been made according to the existing 
evidence base, but further research investment is needed to fill the many gaps. 
Further, personalized approaches to healthy aging complemented by 
population-wide approaches and broader cross-sector partnerships will help to 
ensure greater longevity is an opportunity, rather than a burden, for society.

Cost-effectiveness of subdermal implantable buprenorphine versus sublingual 
buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.

AIMS: Subdermal implantable buprenorphine (BSI) was recently approved to treat 
opioid use disorder (OUD) in clinically-stable adults. In the pivotal clinical 
trial, BSI was associated with a higher proportion of completely-abstinent 
patients (85.7% vs 71.9%; p = .03) vs sublingual buprenorphine (SL-BPN). 
Elsewhere, relapse to illicit drug use is associated with diminished treatment 
outcomes and increased costs. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BSI 
vs SL-BPN from a US societal perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model simulated BSI and SL-BPN cohorts (clinically-stable 
adults) transiting through four mutually-exclusive health states for 12 months. 
Cohorts accumulated direct medical costs from drug acquisition/administration; 
treatment-diversion/abuse; newly-acquired hepatitis-C; emergency room, hospital, 
and rehabilitation services; and pediatric poisonings. Non-medical costs of 
criminality, lost wages/work-productivity, and out-of-pocket expenses were also 
included. Transition probabilities to a relapsed state were derived from the 
aforementioned trial. Other transition probabilities, costs, and health-state 
utilities were derived from observational studies and adjusted for trial 
characteristics. Outcomes included incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained and incremental net-monetary-benefit 
(INMB). Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: BSI was associated with lower total costs (-$4,386), more QALYs 
(+0.031), and favorable INMB at all willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds 
considered. Higher drug acquisition costs for BSI (+$6,492) were outpaced, 
primarily by reductions in emergency room/hospital utilization (-$8,040) and 
criminality (-$1,212). BSI was cost-effective in 89% of PSA model replicates, 
and had a significantly higher NMB at $50,000/QALY ($20,783 vs $15,007; 
p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: BSI was preferred over SL-BPN from a health-economic perspective 
for treatment of OUD in clinically-stable adults. These findings should be 
interpreted carefully, due to some relationships having been modeled from inputs 
derived from multiple sources, and would benefit from comparison with outcomes 
from studies that employ administrative claims data or a naturalistic 
comparative design.

Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the endocrine system and 
the incidence has been increasing in recent years. In a great part of the 
differentiated carcinomas, thyrocytes are capable of uptaking iodide. In these 
cases, the main therapeutic approach includes thyroidectomy followed by ablative 
therapy with radioiodine. However, in part of the patients, the capacity to 
concentrate iodide is lost due to down-regulation of the sodium-iodide symporter 
(NIS), the protein responsible for transporting iodide into the thyrocytes. 
Thus, therapy with radioiodide becomes ineffective, limiting therapeutic options 
and reducing the life expectancy of the patient. Excessive ingestion of some 
flavonoids has been associated with thyroid dysfunction and goiter. 
Nevertheless, studies have shown that some flavonoids can be beneficial for 
thyroid cancer, by reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death, 
besides increasing NIS mRNA levels and iodide uptake. Recent data show that the 
flavonoids apingenin and rutin are capable of increasing NIS function and 
expression in vivo. Herein we review literature data regarding the effect of 
flavonoids on thyroid cancer, besides the effect of these compounds on the 
expression and function of the sodium-iodide symporter. We will also discuss the 
possibility of using flavonoids as adjuvants for therapy of thyroid cancer.

IMPORTANCE: Older adults with limited life expectancy are frequently screened 
for cancer even though it exposes them to risks of screening with minimal 
benefit. Patient preferences may be an important contributor to continued 
screening.
OBJECTIVE: To examine older adults' views on the decision to stop cancer 
screening when life expectancy is limited and to identify older adults' 
preferences for how clinicians should communicate recommendations to cease 
cancer screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this semistructured interview study, we 
interviewed 40 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65 years) recruited at 4 
clinical programs affiliated with an urban academic medical center.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: We transcribed the audio recorded discussions and 
analyzed the transcripts using standard techniques of qualitative content 
analysis to identify major themes and subthemes.
RESULTS: The participants' average age was 75.7 years. Twenty-three participants 
(57.5%) were female; 25 (62.5%) were white. Estimated life expectancy was less 
than 10 years for 19 participants (47.5%). We identified 3 key themes. First, 
participants were amenable to stopping cancer screening, especially in the 
context of a trusting relationship with their clinician. Second, although many 
participants supported using age and health status to individualize the 
screening decision, they did not often understand the role of life expectancy. 
All except 2 participants objected to a Choosing Wisely statement about not 
recommending cancer screening in those with limited life expectancy, often 
believing that clinicians cannot accurately predict life expectancy. Third, 
participants preferred that clinicians explain a recommendation to stop 
screening by incorporating individual health status but were divided on whether 
life expectancy should be mentioned. Specific wording of life expectancy was 
important; many felt the language of "you may not live long enough to benefit 
from this test" was unnecessarily harsh compared with the more positive 
messaging of "this test would not help you live longer."
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although research and clinical practice guidelines 
recommend using life expectancy to inform cancer screening, older adults may not 
consider life expectancy important in screening and may not prefer to hear about 
life expectancy when discussing screening. The described communication 
preferences can help inform future screening discussions. Better delineating 
patient-centered approaches to discuss screening cessation is an important step 
toward optimizing cancer screening in older adults.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasing cause of morbidity 
among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH). We projected 
cumulative CVD risk in PLWH in care compared to the US general population and 
persons HIV-uninfected, but at high risk for HIV.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model to project cumulative CVD incidence. We 
simulated a male and female cohort for each of 3 populations: US general 
population; HIV-uninfected, at high risk for HIV; and PLWH. We incorporated the 
higher smoking prevalence and increased CVD risk due to smoking into the 
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected, at high risk for HIV populations. We 
incorporated HIV-attributable CVD risk, independent of smoking.
RESULTS: For men, life expectancy ranged from 70.2 to 77.5 years and for women 
from 67.0 to 81.1 years (PLWH, US general population). Without antiretroviral 
therapy, lifetime CVD risk for HIV-infected males and females was 12.9% and 
9.0%. For males, by age 60, cumulative CVD incidence was estimated at 20.5% in 
PLWH in care, 14.6% in HIV-uninfected high-risk persons, and 12.8% in the US 
general population. For females, cumulative CVD incidence was projected to be 
13.8% in PLWH in care, 9.7% for high-risk HIV-uninfected persons, and 9.4% in 
the US general population. Lifetime CVD risk was 64.8% for HIV-infected males 
compared to 54.8% for males in the US general population, but similar among 
females.
CONCLUSIONS: CVD risks should be a part of treatment evaluation among PLWH. CVD 
prevention strategies could offer important health benefits for PLWH and should 
be evaluated.

Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) and cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) may cause 
significant morbidity and even fetal or neonatal mortality. We aimed to quantify 
the disease burden of CT and cCMV in Belgium in terms of disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) and identify data gaps. The public health impact of CT and 
cCMV in Belgium in 2013 was 188 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 43-419) and 1976 
(95% UI, 757-4067) DALYs, respectively. The major data gaps identified were 
representative Belgian studies; information on important sequelae, intrauterine 
mortality, and termination of pregnancy; and late onset sequelae. A scenario 
analysis showed important increases in years of life lost when the burden due to 
fetal losses was included and decreases in DALYs when comprehensive CT 
prevention measures were conducted. Addressing the key data gaps identified may 
allow generation of the data needed to break the vicious circle of 
underrecognition.

This study examined whether the number of teeth contributes to the compression 
of morbidity, measured as a shortening of life expectancy with disability, an 
extension of healthy life expectancy, and overall life expectancy. A prospective 
cohort study was conducted. A self-reported baseline survey was given to 126,438 
community-dwelling older people aged ≥65 y in Japan in 2010, and 85,161 (67.4%) 
responded. The onset of functional disability and all-cause mortality were 
followed up for 1,374 d (follow-up rate = 96.1%). A sex-stratified illness-death 
model was applied to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for 3 health 
transitions (healthy to dead, healthy to disabled, and disabled to dead). 
Absolute differences in life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and life 
expectancy with disability according to the number of teeth were also estimated. 
Age, denture use, socioeconomic status, health status, and health behavior were 
adjusted. Compared with the edentulous participants, participants with ≥20 teeth 
had lower risks of transitioning from healthy to dead (adjusted HR, 0.58 [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.50-0.68] for men and 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.85] for 
women) and from healthy to disabled (adjusted HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.44-0.61] for 
men and 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.68] for women). They also transitioned from 
disabled to dead earlier (adjusted HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.99-1.60] for men and 2.42 
[95% CI, 1.72-3.38] for women). Among the participants aged ≥85 y, those with 
≥20 teeth had a longer life expectancy (men: +57 d; women: +15 d) and healthy 
life expectancy (men: +92 d; women: +70 d) and a shorter life expectancy with 
disability (men: -35 d; women: -55 d) compared with the edentulous participants. 
Similar associations were observed among the younger participants and those with 
1 to 9 or 10 to 19 teeth. The presence of remaining teeth was associated with a 
significant compression of morbidity: older Japanese adults' life expectancy 
with disability was compressed by 35 to 55 d within the follow-up of 1,374 d.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy continues to increase around the world, the use 
of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) could be beneficial for octogenarian and 
older gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: A total of 359 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery 
between March 2011 and March 2015 were enrolled; 80 of these patients (22.2%) 
were octogenarians and older. Surgical approaches included MIS (50 laparoscopic 
and 65 robotic) and open surgery (n = 244). Surgical outcomes of MIS and open
