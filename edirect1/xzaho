identify mechanisms underlying this differential response to CR, effects of CR 
on the expression of insulin-related genes were compared in GHRKO and normal 
mice. In addition to changes detected in both genotypes, and responses unique to 
GHRKO mice, the levels of Akt2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha) were increased and levels of 
phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 were reduced in response to CR 
only in normal mice. These changes may be related to mechanisms of improving 
insulin sensitivity and life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and cost effectiveness of implementing 
evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of stroke.
DESIGN: Cluster-randomised trial
SETTING: Three primary care organisations in the North of England covering a 
population of 400,000.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy six primary care teams in four clusters: North, South & 
West, City I and City II.
INTERVENTION: Guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation 
and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) were developed and implemented using a 
multifaceted approach including evidence-based recommendations, audit and 
feedback, interactive educational sessions, patient prompts and outreach visits.
OUTCOMES: Identification and appropriate treatment of patients with atrial 
fibrillation or TIA, and cost effectiveness.
RESULTS: Implementation led to 36% increase (95% CI 4% to 78%) in diagnosis of 
atrial fibrillation, and improved treatment of TIA (odds ratio of complying with 
guidelines 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8). Combined analysis of atrial fibrillation and 
TIA estimates that compliance was significantly greater (OR 1.46 95% CI 1.10 to 
1.94) in the condition for which practices had received the implementation 
programme. The development and implementation of guidelines cost less than 1500 
pounds per practice. The estimated costs per quality-adjusted life year gained 
by patients with atrial fibrillation or TIA were both less than 2000 pounds, 
very much less than the usual criterion for cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of evidence-based guidelines improved the quality of 
primary care for atrial fibrillation and TIA. The intervention was feasible and 
very cost effective. Key components of the model include contextual analysis, 
strong professional support, clear recommendations based on robust evidence, 
simplicity of adoption, good communication and use of established networks and 
opinion leaders.

The declining prevalence of left-handers with age has resulted in the hypothesis 
that sinistrality, being the result of a developmental insult, may be associated 
with a reduced life span. While it is plausible that some individuals become 
left-handed as a consequence of neurologic impairment, the literature on 
handedness itself appears to suffer from a number of problems. These include the 
ease with which information on handedness can be collected in the absence of 
prior hypotheses, the failure to address heterogeneity among left-handers, and 
the selective publication of positive results. Even if individual contributions, 
including one published in this issue of Epidemiology, are of reasonable 
quality, all the above problems conspire to lower the credibility of this area 
of research.

This study was aimed at determining the effect of a group-based exercise program 
on the physical performance, muscle strength and quality of life (QoL) in older 
women. Twenty women performed an exercise program for 8 weeks, at the 
rehabilitation unit. Outcome measures included a 4-m and 20-m walk test, a 6-min 
walk test, stair climbing and chair rise time, timed up and go test, isokinetic 
muscle testing of the knee and ankle, and the short form-36 (SF-36) and 
geriatric depression scale (GDS) questionnaires. The mean age of the study group 
was 70.3+/-6.5 years. After the completion of the exercise program, all of the 
physical performance tests and the SF-36 scores for the participants showed 
statistically significant improvements (p<0.05). In the isokinetic evaluations, 
most of angular velocities showed a significant increase in the peak torque (PT) 
values for knee extension and flexion, and for ankle plantar flexion (p<0.05). 
We concluded that this exercise program, when applied to older women, resulted 
in improved physical performance, increased muscle strength measured in both the 
knee and ankle, and improvement in the scores, estimating the QoL. We have shown 
that this exercise program is both effective and reliable for this age group of 
women.

Preferences for current health and their association with outcomes in patients 
with kidney disease.

21205, USA.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic disease who express stronger preference for 
their current health might be expected to have better outcomes than patients who 
assign lower utility to their current health state.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine associations between preferences for current 
health and outcomes in a national cohort of incident hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: In 567 patients treated at 74 clinics, we measured patients' 
preferences by time trade-off on a 0-1 scale (1=willingness to sacrifice no life 
expectancy to achieve perfect health; 0=zero value of current health). 
Associations between these preferences and outcomes were examined with Poisson 
(hospitalization), logistic (progression of comorbidity and clinical 
performance), and Cox proportional hazards (mortality) models.
RESULTS: The distribution of preference scores was skewed, with a mean of 0.69 
and a median of 0.83. Highest (1.0) scores were associated with decreased 
incidence of hospitalization (incidence risk ratio=0.88, 95% confidence 
interval=0.80-0.97), relative to the lowest (<0.50) scores, a finding that was 
consistent across gender and race, with women and white subjects having greater 
decreases (Pinteraction<0.001). Higher preferences for current health also were 
associated with less worsening of comorbidity. Adjusted risks of death for 
patients with intermediate (>or=0.50-1.0) and the highest preference scores for 
current health were not different from those with lower scores.
CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic kidney disease, a stronger preference for 
current health is associated with lower hospital admission rates and improved 
comorbidity but not better survival.

Use of the U.S. and U.K. scoring algorithm for the EuroQol-5D in an economic 
evaluation of cardiac care.

at the University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Most studies that have used the EuroQol-5D instrument (EQ-5D) have 
used a scoring algorithm based on preferences solicited from the U.K. 
population. An algorithm recently was developed for the U.S. population, with 
studies showing meaningful differences in the results obtained using the 2 
algorithms. We recently published an economic evaluation assessing the use of 
drug-eluting stents in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI).
OBJECTIVES: Using the aforementioned economic evaluation, we describe the EQ-5D 
utility scores resulting from use of U.S. and U.K. algorithms and explore the 
differences in the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) resulting from use of 
the different EQ-5D estimates.
METHODS: EQ-5D data were obtained from the Alberta Provincial Project for 
Outcomes Assessment in Coronary Heart (APPROACH) disease registry. Individual 
responses were scored once with each algorithm. The within-individual difference 
was calculated (U.S. score-U.K. score). The mean, SD, and range were compared 
using paired t tests. The resulting ICERs were compared using probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The U.K. mean was statistically different from the U.S. mean (0.83, SD 
0.20 vs. 0.87, SD 0.15, P<0.001). The mean within individual difference was 0.04 
with a wide range (-0.02 to +0.41). The resulting ICER are CAN $58,635 (95% 
confidence interval $198,248-$34,406) per quality-adjusted life year and CAN 
$58,229 (95% confidence interval $116,818-$38,779) per quality-adjusted life 
year for the U.K. and U.S. algorithms, respectively (P value: 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithms produce quite notable differences within 
individuals. The effect on the mean score is less pronounced. In the context of 
our economic evaluation, however, the impact of using the U.S. algorithm on the 
ICER is negligible.

Trigeminal neuropathy.

Trigeminal neuropathies (TNs) are well recognized disorders characterized and 
manifesting as skin and mucosal numbness in the region innervated by the 
trigeminal nerve. Facial numbness indicates trigeminal sensory alteration 
affecting the trigeminal system. TNs always pose differential location 
difficulties as multiple diseases are capable of producing them: they can be the 
result of traumatism, tumors, or diseases of the connective tissue, infectious 
or demyelinating diseases, or may be of idiopathic origin. Their importance is 
explained by the fact that TN may represent the first manifestation of tumor 
disease, or of relapse in patients with prior neoplastic processes. As such, 
these manifestations are ominous, and patient life expectancy is often short. 
The clinical exploration reveals a loss of sensitivity in the cutaneous 
territory corresponding to the affected nerve, which can be partial 
(hypoesthesia) or complete (anesthesia). The sensory defect is occasionally 
associated with hyperesthesia (i.e., the patient suffers a decrease in sensory 
perception, but when sensation is perceived, it may cause considerable 
discomfort). Complementary studies are needed to establish the etiologic 
diagnosis, with laboratory tests to discard the possible causative diseases 
underlying the trigeminal neuropathy, and the opportune radiographic 
examinations in the form of plain X-rays or a routine cranial computed 
tomography scan.

Coupure Links, Ghent, Belgium.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) gas is a strong oxidizing and sanitizing agent that 
has a broad and high biocidal effectiveness and big penetration ability; its 
efficacy to prolong the shelf-life of a minimally processed (MP) vegetable, 
grated carrots (Daucus carota L.), was tested in this study. Carrots were 
sorted, their ends removed, hand peeled, cut, washed, spin dried and separated 
in 2 portions, one to be treated with ClO(2) gas and the other to remain 
untreated for comparisons. MP carrots were decontaminated in a cabinet at 91% 
relative humidity and 28 degrees C for up to 6 min, including 30 s of ClO(2) 
injection to the cabinet, then stored under equilibrium modified atmosphere 
(4.5% O(2), 8.9% CO(2), 86.6% N(2)) at 7 degrees C for shelf-life studies. 
ClO(2) concentration in the cabinet rose to 1.33 mg/l after 30 s of treatment, 
and then fell to nil before 6 min. The shelf-life study included: O(2) and CO(2) 
headspace concentrations, microbiological quality (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, 
psychrotrophs, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts), sensory quality (odour, 
flavour, texture, overall visual quality, and white blushing), and pH. ClO(2) 
did not affect respiration rate of MP carrots significantly (alpha< or =0.05), 
and lowered the pH significantly (alpha< or =0.05). The applied packaging 
configuration kept O(2) headspace concentrations in treated samples in 
equilibrium and prevented CO(2) accumulation. After ClO(2) treatment, the 
decontamination levels (log CFU/g) achieved were 1.88, 1.71, 2.60, and 0.66 for 
mesophilic aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophs, and yeasts respectively. The initial 
sensory quality of MP carrots was not impaired significantly (alpha< or =0.05). 
A lag phase of at least 2 days was observed for mesophilic aerobic bacteria, 
psychrotrophs, and lactic acid bacteria in treated samples, while mesophilic 
aerobic bacteria and psychrotrophs increased parallelly. Odour was the only 
important attribute in sensory deterioration, but it reached an unacceptable 
score when samples were already rejected from the microbiological point of view. 
The shelf-life extension was limited to one day due to the restricted effect of 
the ClO(2) treatment on yeast counts. Nevertheless, ClO(2) seems to be a 
promising alternative to prolong the shelf-life of grated carrots.

Relative cost of a line of vision in age-related macular degeneration.

Smiddy WE(1).

Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA. wsmiddy@med.miami.edu

PURPOSE: To quantitate the relative cost of new therapies for age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) versus saved vision.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: Landmark AMD treatment studies were reviewed to quantitate the visual 
benefit. For comparison, representative treatment studies for common retinal 
conditions including retinal detachment, macular hole (MH), epiretinal membrane 
(ERM), and diabetic retinopathy were also reviewed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Several parameters to estimate Snellen lines of vision 
saved were defined and tabulated for each condition. A regimen of office visits, 
ancillary testing, and treatments was outlined. Costs for this were tabulated 
using Medicare-allowable costs, and costs of visual benefit (per line of vision) 
for each condition were calculated. Life expectancy was factored in to calculate 
the cost of a line of vision for each year (line-year). The proportions of costs 
allocated to professional, technical, and pharmaceutical expenses were tabulated 
for each therapy.
RESULTS: The cost per line of vision saved for AMD therapies ranged from $997 
for laser for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization, to $5509 for 
photodynamic therapy for occult lesions, to $12 482 for pegaptanib injections. 
This compares to $651 for retinal detachment repair, $1658 for MH repair, $2411 
for ERM peeling, $5458 for diabetic macular edema laser, $594 for panretinal 
photocoagulation, and $2984 to $4178 for diabetic vitrectomy. The costs per 
line-years ranged from $77 to $1248 for AMD, and $21 to $194 for the comparison 
conditions. The proportion of costs for pegaptanib treatment was 17% for 
professional fees and 70% for pharmaceutical fees. Assumptions incorporated in 
estimating costs for pegaptanib could easily have doubled because second-year 
costs might approximate first-year costs and the maintenance of treatment effect 
has not been well established.
CONCLUSIONS: Although correctly heralded as a breakthrough in macular 
degeneration treatment, new pharmacologic therapies for AMD are extremely 
expensive and some yield marginal visual dividends. As in all fields of medicine 
that provide care to elderly patients, these costs should be considered as they 
relate to health care costs for the individual patient and payors, and must be 
considered in a larger perspective of health care benefit apportionment.

Extension of human cell lifespan by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.

Medicine (Cardiology), University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario Canada N6A

Extending the productive lifespan of human cells could have major implications 
for diseases of aging, such as atherosclerosis. We identified a relationship 
between aging of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and nicotinamide 
phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt/PBEF/Visfatin), the rate-limiting enzyme for 
NAD+ salvage from nicotinamide. Replicative senescence of SMCs was preceded by a 
marked decline in the expression and activity of Nampt. Furthermore, reducing 
Nampt activity with the antagonist FK866 induced premature senescence in SMCs, 
assessed by serial quantification of the proportion of cells with 
senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. In contrast, introducing the 
Nampt gene into aging human SMCs delayed senescence and substantially lengthened 
cell lifespan, together with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. 
Nampt-mediated SMC lifespan extension was associated with increased activity of 
the NAD+-dependent longevity enzyme SIRT1 and was abrogated in 
Nampt-overexpressing cells transduced with a dominant-negative form of SIRT1 
(H363Y). Nampt overexpression also reduced the fraction of p53 that was 
acetylated on lysine 382, a target of SIRT1, suppressed an age-related increase 
in p53 expression, and increased the rate of p53 degradation. Moreover, add-back 
of p53 with recombinant adenovirus blocked the anti-aging effects of Nampt. 
These data indicate that Nampt is a longevity protein that can add 
stress-resistant life to human SMCs by optimizing SIRT1-mediated p53 
degradation.

Emerging health issues: the widening challenge for population health promotion.

McMichael AJ(1), Butler CD.

Author information:
(1)National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Australian National 
University, Canberra, Australia.

The spectrum of tasks for health promotion has widened since the Ottawa Charter 
was signed. In 1986, infectious diseases still seemed in retreat, the potential 
extent of HIV/AIDS was unrecognized, the Green Revolution was at its height and 
global poverty appeared less intractable. Global climate change had not yet 
emerged as a major threat to development and health. Most economists forecast 
continuous improvement, and chronic diseases were broadly anticipated as the 
next major health issue. Today, although many broadly averaged measures of 
population health have improved, many of the determinants of global health have 
faltered. Many infectious diseases have emerged; others have unexpectedly 
reappeared. Reasons include urban crowding, environmental changes, altered 
sexual relations, intensified food production and increased mobility and trade. 
Foremost, however, is the persistence of poverty and the exacerbation of 
regional and global inequality. Life expectancy has unexpectedly declined in 
several countries. Rather than being a faint echo from an earlier time of 
hardship, these declines could signify the future. Relatedly, the demographic 
and epidemiological transitions have faltered. In some regions, declining 
fertility has overshot that needed for optimal age structure, whereas elsewhere 
mortality increases have reduced population growth rates, despite continuing 
high fertility. Few, if any, Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including those 
for health and sustainability, seem achievable. Policy-makers generally 
misunderstand the link between environmental sustainability (MDG #7) and health. 
Many health workers also fail to realize that social cohesion and 
sustainability--maintenance of the Earth's ecological and geophysical 
systems--is a necessary basis for health. In sum, these issues present an 
enormous challenge to health. Health promotion must address population health 
influences that transcend national boundaries and generations and engage with 
the development, human rights and environmental movements. The big task is to 
promote sustainable environmental and social conditions that bring enduring and 
equitable health gains.

What is the most cost-effective population-based cancer screening program for 
Chinese women?

Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.

Comment in
    J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 20;25(6):609-10.

PURPOSE: To develop a policy-relevant generalized cost-effectiveness (CE) model 
of population-based cancer screening for Chinese women.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and associated screening 
and treatment costs under population-based screening using cervical cytology 
(cervical cancer), mammography (breast cancer), and fecal occult blood testing 
(FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (colorectal 
cancer) were estimated, from which average and incremental CE ratios were 
generated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess 
stochasticity, parameter uncertainty, and model assumptions.
RESULTS: Cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers were together responsible for 
13,556 DALYs (in a 1:4:3 ratio, respectively) in Hong Kong's 3.4 million female 
population annually. All status quo strategies were dominated, thus confirming 
the suboptimal efficiency of opportunistic screening. Current patterns of 
screening averted 471 DALYs every year, which could potentially be more than 
doubled to 1,161 DALYs under the same screening and treatment budgetary 
threshold of US $50 million with 100% Pap coverage every 4 years and 30% 
coverage of colonoscopy every 10 years. With higher budgetary caps, biennial 
mammographic screening starting at age 50 years can be introduced.
CONCLUSION: Our findings have informed how best to achieve allocative efficiency 
in deploying scarce cancer care dollars but must be coupled with better 
integrated care planning, improved intersectoral coordination, increased 
resources, and stronger political will to realize the potential health and 
economic gains as demonstrated.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 12-month adjuvant trastuzumab 
therapy in women with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
-positive early breast cancer.
METHODS: A Markov model tracked quarterly patients' transitions between five 
health states: disease free, local relapse, disease free after local relapse, 
metastatic disease, and death. Patients were allowed to incur symptomatic or 
asymptomatic transient cardiac dysfunction during trastuzumab administration. 
Probabilities were derived mainly from the combined report of the National 
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31 and the North Central Cancer 
Treatment Group N9831 trials (95% node positive) and a meta-analysis by the 
Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group. Costs were estimated from 
the perspective of the Italian and US health care systems. The analysis was run 
during a 15-year time horizon. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied to both 
costs and life-years. Second-order Monte-Carlo and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Adjuvant trastuzumab increases life expectancy by 1.54 (1.18 
discounted) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). At a cost of 675 euros and 767 
dollars per weekly dose in the Italian and US setting, respectively, trastuzumab 
achieves its clinical benefit at a cost of 14,861 euros (95% CI, 3,917 euros to 
44,028 euros) and 18,970 dollars (95% CI, 6,014 dollars to 45,621 dollars) per 
QALY saved. The incremental cost effectiveness was higher than 50,000 euros/QALY 
(or 60,000 dollars/QALY) at time horizons shorter than 7.8 years and for 
patients older than 76 years or with a 10-year risk of relapse lower than 15%. 
The results confirmed the cost effectiveness when simulating a Herceptin 
Adjuvant Trial (HERA) -like scenario at multiway sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: In a long-term horizon, adjuvant trastuzumab is a cost-effective 
therapy for patients with HER2-positive, high-risk, early breast cancer.

PURPOSE: One-year adjuvant trastuzumab (AT) therapy, with or without 
anthracyclines, increases disease-free and overall survival in early-stage 
HER2/neu-positive breast cancer. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
these regimens, which are expensive and potentially toxic.
METHODS: We used a Markov health-state transition model to simulate three 
adjuvant therapy options for a cohort of 49-year-old women with 
HER2/neu-positive early-stage breast cancer: conventional chemotherapy without 
trastuzumab; anthracycline-based AT regimens used in the National Surgical 
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31 and North Central Cancer Treatment Group 
N9831 trials; and the nonanthracycline AT regimen used in the Breast Cancer 
International Research group 006 trial. The base case used treatment efficacy 
measures reported in the randomized clinical trials of AT. We measured health 
outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in 2005 United States 
dollars (US dollars) and subjected results to probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: In the base case, the anthracycline-based AT arm has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 39,982 dollars/QALY, whereas the 
nonanthracycline AT arm is more expensive and less effective; this result is 
insensitive to changes in recurrence rates, but if there is no benefit after 4 
years, ICERs exceed 100,000 dollars/QALY for both AT arms. Results are 
moderately sensitive to variation in breast cancer survival rates and 
trastuzumab cost, and less sensitive to variations in cardiac toxicity.
CONCLUSION: AT has an ICER comparable to those for other widely used 
interventions. Longer clinical follow-up is warranted to evaluate the long-term 
efficacy and toxicity of different AT regimens.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common side effect of 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with increased risk of fracture 
and cardiovascular events (CV). Current standard treatment includes dietary 
control, phosphate binders and vitamin D. However, many patients do not have 
their parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphate levels controlled by this 
regimen. Cinacalcet is the first of a new class of calcimimetic drugs which 
suppress PTH production. Although there is convincing evidence of the impact of 
cinacalcet on serum biomarkers, the long-term clinical implications of treatment 
are less clear. The aim of this study is to estimate the cost-utility of 
cinacalcet as an addition to standard treatment of SHPT compared with standard 
treatment alone.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility 
of cinacalcet. Uncertainty was explored through extensive sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with standard treatment, cinacalcet incurs average additional 
lifetime costs of pound21,167 per person and confers an additional 0.34 quality 
adjusted life years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
pound61,890 (approximately euro89,000) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Extensive one-way sensitivity analysis showed that cinacalcet was only likely to 
be considered cost-effective if the relative risk of mortality for people with 
very high levels of PTH was 2.2 compared with people whose PTH reached target 
levels, or if drug costs were considerably reduced. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed cinacalcet was very unlikely to be cost-effective at usual 
levels of willingness to pay in the National Health Service (NHS).
CONCLUSION: Unless the cost of cinacalcet is considerably reduced, it is 
unlikely to be considered a cost-effective treatment for people with SHPT.

Semi-parametric regression models for cost-effectiveness analysis: improving the 
efficiency of estimation from censored data.

In a cost-effectiveness analysis using clinical trial data, estimates of the 
between-treatment difference in mean cost and mean effectiveness are needed. 
Several methods for handling censored data have been suggested. One of them is 
inverse-probability weighting, and has the advantage that it can also be applied 
to estimate the parameters from a linear regression of the mean. Such regression 
models can potentially estimate the treatment contrast more precisely, since 
some of the residual variance can be explained by baseline covariates. The 
drawback, however, is that inverse-probability weighting may not be efficient. 
Using existing results on semi-parametric efficiency, this paper derives the 
semi-parametric efficient parameter estimates for regression of mean cost, mean 
quality-adjusted survival time and mean survival time. The performance of these 
estimates is evaluated through a simulation study. Applying both the new 
estimators and the inverse-probability weighted estimators to the results of the 
EVALUATE trial showed that the new estimators achieved a halving of the variance 
of the estimated treatment contrast for cost. Some practical suggestions for 
choosing an estimator are offered.

Pharmacotherapeutic strategies using small molecules for the treatment of 
glycolipid lysosomal storage disorders.

The glycolipid lysosomal storage diseases are a collection of rare, inherited 
disorders of metabolism associated with heterogeneous pathologies and reduced 
life expectancy. Reduction of the substrate that accumulates due to catabolic 
enzyme deficiency can be mediated by an increasing number of therapeutic 
approaches, including enzyme replacement, pharmacological intervention to reduce 
substrate synthesis or enhance residual enzyme activity, and cell or gene 
therapy. The success of one agent, the imino sugar miglustat, has provided the 
impetus for using similar molecules for enzyme enhancement, or 
chaperone-mediated therapy for exiting medical conditions and for conditions 
where no disease-specific therapy is available. The advantages of using small 
molecules as therapy for the family of lysosomal storage disorders are discussed 
with reference to existing enzyme replacement therapies.

This cost-of-illness analysis based on information from 921 patients in Italy is 
part of a Europe-wide cost-of-illness study in multiple sclerosis (MS). The 
objective was to analyze the costs and quality of life (QOL) related to the 
level of disease severity and progression. Patients registered with the Italian 
MS patient organization were asked to participate in a mail survey, and 31% 
responded. The questionnaire asked for details on the disease (type of disease, 
relapses, level of functional disability), information on all medical and 
non-medical resource consumption, and informal care and work capacity (sick 
leave and early retirement). In addition, patients were asked about their 
current QOL (in the form of utility) and the level of fatigue. The mean age of 
respondents was 46 years, and 8.5% were 65 years or older. As many as 20% of 
patients had severe disease (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score of > 
or =7), 47% had moderate disease (EDSS score of 4-6.5) and only 31% had mild 
disease (EDSS score of 0-3). Thus, the mean EDSS score in the sample was 4.6 
(median 5.0), with a utility of 0.53 (range: 0 = death to 1 = full health) and a 
fatigue level of 6.4 (range: 1 = not tired to 10 = extremely tired). Costs and 
utility are highly correlated with disease severity. Workforce participation 
decreases from approximately 80% in early disease to less than 10% in the very 
late stages. Total costs increase fivefold between an EDSS score of 0-1 and a 
score of 7. Health-care costs, however, show a limited increase with worsening 
disease--hospitalization increases from euro 800 per patient to euro 3200, and 
ambulatory care increases from euro 900 to euro 1500. Productivity losses, on 
the other hand, increase by a factor of 12, while informal care increases from 
euro 500 at an EDSS score of 0-1 to nearly euro 25 000 at an EDSS score of 7, 
and euro 39 000 at an EDSS score of 8-9. Hence, total mean costs per patient are 
determined essentially by the distribution of the severity levels in the sample, 
increasing from euro 12 000 at an EDSS score of 0-1 to euro 57 000 at an EDSS 
score of 7, and euro 71 000 at an EDSS score of 8-9. The same is true for 
utility, which decreases from 0.80 to 0.06 as the disease becomes severe. 
However, the utility loss compared to the age- and gender-matched general 
population is high at all levels of the disease, leading to an estimated annual 
loss of 0.3 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) per patient. Relapses for patients 
with an EDSS score of <5 are associated with a cost of approximately euro 4000 
and a utility loss of 0.18 during the quarter in which they occur.

This cost-of-illness analysis based on information from 2973 patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) in Germany is part of a Europe-wide study on the costs 
of MS. The objective was to analyze the costs and quality of life (QOL) related 
to the level of disease severity. Patients from six centres (office- and 
hospital-based physicians) and patients enrolled in a database were asked to 
participate in the survey; 38% answered a mail questionnaire. In addition to 
details on the disease (type of disease, relapses, level of functional 
disability), the questionnaire asked for information on all resource 
consumption, medical, non-medical, work absence, informal care, as well as QOL 
(measured as utility). The mean age of the cohort was 45 years, and 18% of 
patients were 65 years of age or older. Forty-seven percent of patients had mild 
disease (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score 0-3), 36% had moderate 
disease (EDSS score 4-6.5) and 12% had severe disease (EDSS score > or =7). The 
mean EDSS score in the sample was 3.8 (median 4.0), with a mean utility of 0.62. 
Costs and utility are highly correlated with disease severity. Workforce 
participation decreases from 73% in very early disease to less than 10% in the 
very late stages, leading to a tenfold rise in productivity losses in the late 
stages of disease. Hospitalisation and ambulatory visits rise by a factor of 5-6 
between early and late disease; investments and services increase from basically 
no cost to euro 2700; and informal care increases by a factor of 27 for patients 
with an EDSS score of 7 and by a factor of 50 for patients at the very severe 
end of the EDSS scale (8-9). Hence, total mean costs per patient are determined 
essentially by the distribution of the severity levels in the sample, increasing 
from approximately euro 18 500 at an EDSS score of 0-1 to euro 70 500 at an EDSS 
score of 8-9. The same is true for utility, which decreases from 0.86 to 0.10 as 
the disease becomes severe. However, the utility loss compared to the general 
population is high at all levels of the disease, leading to an estimated loss of 
0.2 quality-adjusted life-years per patient. Relapses are associated with a cost 
of approximately euro 3 000 and a utility loss of 0.1 during the quarter in 
which they occur. Compared with a similar study performed in 1999, resource 
consumption, with the exception of drugs, is somewhat lower. This is most likely 
due to a difference in the severity distribution of the two samples and to 
changes in health-care consumption overall in the country, such as the 
introduction of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs, Fallpauschalen).

Costs and quality of life of multiple sclerosis in Switzerland.

This cost-of-illness analysis, based on information from 1101 patients in 
Switzerland, is part of a Europe-wide cost-of-illness study in multiple 
sclerosis (MS). The objective was to analyze the costs and quality of life (QOL) 
related to the level of disease severity and progression. Patients registered 
with the Swiss MS patient organization were asked to participate in a mail 
survey and 44% responded. The questionnaire asked for details on the disease 
(type of disease, relapses, level of functional disability), information on all 
medical and non-medical resource consumption, informal care and work capacity 
(sick leave and early retirement). In addition, patients were asked about their 
current QOL (measured as utility) and the level of fatigue. The mean age of 
respondents was 53 years, and 21% were 65 years or older. Almost one-quarter of 
patients in the sample (23%) had severe disease (Expanded Disability Status 
Scale [EDSS] score > or =7), while 36% had moderate disease (EDSS score 4-6.5) 
and 38% had mild disease (EDSS score 0-3). The median EDSS score was 5.0, with a 
mean of 4.5. Mean utility was 0.53 (range, 0 = death to 1 = full health), while 
mean fatigue was rated as 5.4 (range, 1 = not tired to 10 = extremely tired). 
Utility and fatigue were worse for patients with a recent relapse. Costs and 
utility are highly correlated with disease severity. Workforce participation 
decreases from greater than 80% in early disease to less than 10% in the very 
late stages, while total costs increase more than fivefold between an EDSS score 
of 0-1 and an EDSS of 7, and by more than 40% from an EDSS score of 7 to worse 
states. Most cost types increase steadily until patients reach an EDSS score of 
7, after which there is a sharp increase due to home care, home services and 
informal care. The mean annual cost per patient in the sample (65.000 Swiss 
francs, euro 42.000) corresponds to costs for a patient at the median EDSS score 
of 5. Utility decreases from 0.89 to 0.1 as the disease becomes severe, but the 
loss compared to the age- and gender-matched general population can be observed 
at all levels of the disease ( approximately 0.1 at an EDSS score of 2 to 
approximately 0.3 at an EDSS score of 5-6), leading to an estimated annual loss 
of 0.3 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) per patient in the sample. Relapses 
for patients with an EDSS score <5 were associated with a utility loss of 0.08 
and an incremental cost of 5500 Swiss francs (euro 3.500) during the quarter in 
which they occurred. Health-care costs are to a large extent covered by 
insurance, and a substantial amount of services such as home care and home help 
are available to patients with severe disease. These services represent 
approximately 15% of total societal costs and are largely covered, resulting in 
almost 30% of total costs to different payers. Despite this, a large amount of 
costs falls on families providing care, in particular for patients with severe 
disease.

Costs and quality of life of multiple sclerosis in Austria.

Vass K.

This cost-of-illness analysis is part of a Europe-wide study on the costs of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) and is based on information from patients in Austria. 
The objective was to estimate the costs and quality of life (QOL) related to the 
level of disease severity and progression. Questionnaires were sent to 2995 
patients registered with a nationwide patient organization. Patients were asked 
to provide details regarding the type of disease, relapses, level of functional 
disability, resource consumption (medical and non-medical), work absence, sick 
leave and informal care, as well as QOL. Surveys from a total of 1.019 (34.0%) 
patients were used in the analysis, of which the mean (standard deviation [SD]) 
age was 50 (12.2) years; 70% of patients were female. Patients with mild disease 
(Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score 0-3) represented 41% of patients, 
36% had moderate disease (EDSS score 4-6.5) and 22% had severe disease (EDSS 
score > or =7). The mean (SD) EDSS score in the sample was 4.4 (2.4), with a 
mean (SD) utility of 0.55 (0.32). Costs are presented from the societal 
perspective as well as from the viewpoint of payers of care and invalidity. Mean 
total annual costs for an average patient in the sample were estimated at euro 
40.300 in the societal perspective, whereas payers' costs were estimated at only 
half of this. Disease-modifying drugs represented a quarter of all costs in the 
payer perspective, but only 12% of societal costs. For society, the highest cost 
was the loss of productivity (36%), while payments for this loss (invalidity 
pensions and sick-leave compensation) accounted for only 21% of total costs to 
payers. Costs are highly correlated with disease progression, increasing 
four-fold from early disease to very severe disease (euro 16.000 to euro 
63.800). Mean annual costs per patient reported are thus determined by the 
distribution of disease severity in the sample. Workforce participation 
decreases from roughly 75% in early disease to less than 10% in the late stages, 
despite the fact that 70% of patients with an EDSS score of 8 or 9 are still 
below the official retirement age. Consequently, productivity losses increase 
over fivefold. In parallel, costs of informal care increase from euro 325 per 
year at an EDSS score of 0-1 to over euro 20.000 at an EDSS score of 8-9. 
Hospitalization is very infrequent in early disease, representing less than euro 
1.000 for patients with an EDSS score of 0-1, but increases steeply for patients 
with an EDSS score > or =5. QOL, measured as utility scores, decreases rapidly 
from almost 0.90 to 0.05 as disability becomes severe. However, the loss of 
utility is evident at all disease levels. Young patients with an EDSS score of 
approximately 2 have a utility that is 0.15 lower than matched individuals from 
the general population. This loss increases to approximately 0.4 for patients 
over 60 years of age with an average EDSS score of 6.0-6.5. Patients with a 
recent relapse had lower utility (-0.1) and higher costs (+ euro 4.750).

This cost-of-illness analysis is based on information from 1.848 patients in 
Spain and is part of a Europe-wide study on the costs of multiple sclerosis. The 
objective was to analyze the costs and quality of life (QOL) related to the 
level of disease severity and progression. Patients were identified by the 
Asociación Española de Esclerosis Múltiple (AEDEM) and participated in the 
survey by answering a mail questionnaire (response rate 31.8%). In addition to 
details on the disease (type of disease, relapses, level of functional 
disability), the questionnaire asked for information on all resource 
consumption, medical, non-medical, work absence and informal care, as well as 
utility (QOL). The mean age of the cohort was 45 years, and only 5.5% of 
patients were 65 years of age or more. Approximately 36% of patients had mild 
disease (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score of 0-3), 44.8% had 
moderate disease (EDSS score of 4-6.5) and 17.7% had severe disease (EDSS score 
> or =7). The mean EDSS score in the sample was 4.5 (median 5.0), with a utility 
of 0.554. Costs and utility are highly correlated with disease severity. 
Workforce participation decreases from around 70% in early disease to less than 
5% in the very late stages. Hospitalization is very infrequent in early disease, 
representing less than euro 1.300 per patient per year for patients at EDSS 
scores <6, but increases steeply for patients at scores > or =7. Ambulatory care 
increases fivefold between early and late disease, while investments and 
services increase from basically no cost to just over euro 6.000 at EDSS scores 
> or =7. Productivity losses increase more than eightfold, and informal care 
increases from euro 593 at EDSS scores of 0-1 to nearly euro 34.228 at scores of 
8-9. Hence, total mean costs per patient are driven by the distribution of the 
severity levels in the sample, increasing from euro 10.425 at EDSS scores of 0-1 
to euro 45.264 at a score of 7, and euro 65.693 at scores of 8-9. The same is 
true for utility, which decreases from 0.865 to 0.084 as patients progress from 
the mildest to the most severe disability levels. However, the utility loss 
compared to the age- and gender-matched general population is high at all levels 
of the disease ( approximately 0.25 in patients below 30 years of age with an 
EDSS score of 2-3, and approximately 0.4 in patients over 60 years of age and a 
score of > or =6), leading to an estimated annual loss of 0.276 quality-adjusted 
life-year per patient. Relapses for patients with an EDSS score below 5 are 
associated with a cost of approximately euro 2.750 and a utility loss of 0.1 
during the quarter in which they occur.

Costs and quality of life of multiple sclerosis in the United Kingdom.

This cost-of-illness analysis for the United Kingdom is part of a Europe-wide 
study on the costs of multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective was to analyze the 
costs and quality of life (utility) related to the level of disease severity. 
People with MS from a database administered by a UK charity (the MS Trust) were 
asked to participate in the survey by answering a postal questionnaire. In 
addition to details on the disease (type of disease, relapses, level of 
functional disability), the questionnaire asked for information on all resource 
consumption, medical, non-medical, work absence and informal care as well as 
utility. The response rate was 19%, and a total of 2048 people were included. 
The mean age of the cohort was 51 years, and 23% of people were > or =60 years 
of age. Disease severity was concentrated in people with moderately severe MS 
(Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score of 4 to 6.5), with 21, 60 and 19% 
of people reporting mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively. Costs and 
utility are highly correlated with disease severity. Mean annual costs for all 
people in the study increase from approximately pound 12.000 at an EDSS score <4 
to almost pound 60.000 at an EDSS score > or =7. In particular, employment rates 
are reduced from 82% in early disease to 2% at an EDSS score of 8, while the 
costs of inpatient care, investments, informal care and productivity losses 
increase by more than tenfold between an EDSS score of 0-1 and a score > or =7. 
Utility decreases from 0.92 at an EDSS score of 0 to a state worse than death in 
the most severe state (-0.18 at an EDSS score of 9). Compared to the results in 
an earlier cost study in the United Kingdom using a comparable methodology, 
costs have substantially increased, by roughly 40%. Part of the increase is due 
to a higher use of disease-modifying drugs and, possibly linked with this, a 
higher use of ambulatory care and services. Another part of the increase is most 
likely due to an increased age in the current sample, with more patients on 
early retirement due to MS and more intense use of informal care. However, 
another reason may lie in the methodology, e.g. different unit costs or 
differences in the sample distribution, despite a similar mean EDSS score of 
5.1.
