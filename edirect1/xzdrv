The older adult population is growing faster than any age group, which increases 
their risk of frailty. Studies conducted among older adult are relatively scarce 
in Malaysia, especially among Chinese postmenopausal women, who have the longest 
life expectancy. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of 
frailty and its associated factors among Chinese postmenopausal women. A total 
of 220 eligible respondents were recruited, with information on sociodemographic 
background, comorbidities, dietary intake and lifestyle behaviour were obtained 
using a structured questionnaire, while anthropometry indicators were assessed 
according to standard protocol. Fasting blood was withdrawn for the analysis of 
serum 25(OH)D. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine factors 
that predict pre-frailty and frailty. Prevalence of pre-frailty and prevalence 
of frailty were 64.5 and 7.3%, respectively, and most of the respondents 
presented with weak handgrip strength. Pre-frailty was prevalent among the 
younger population. Dietary quality was unsatisfactory among the respondents, 
and the majority of them presented with a high percentage of body fat. An 
increased dietary quality index (DQI), poor sleep and low muscle mass were 
factors that contributed to frailty. In conclusion, nutritional factors should 
be considered in developing health-related policies and programs in reducing and 
delaying the onset of frailty.

Erratum in
    Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2023 Mar 31;20(7):

Due to the significant socioeconomic burden of kidney diseases, we decided to 
analyse years of life lost (YLLs) from this cause in Poland between the years 
2000 and 2019. The standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) measure was used 
to calculate the number of YLLs, the value of which was related to the size of 
the study population and calculated per 100,000 persons (SEYLLp). A time trend 
analysis was performed using the Joinpoint regression method. In 2000, the 
number of YLLs for the entire population was 72,795 (SEYLLp = 190.3 years). 
After a period of minor changes between 2000 and 2011 (increasing at 0.9% per 
year), the YLL index rapidly declined between 2011 and 2015 (at -15.4% yearly) 
and then increased in the last years of the study period (at 12.5% yearly). 
These changes resulted in a decrease in the number of YLLs to 57,278 in 2019 
(SEYLLp = 149.2). The deteriorating health status of Poles after 2015 most 
likely was caused by the aging of the population, as well as the increasing 
incidence of risk factors, in particular diabetes and arterial hypertension.

Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by several 
symptoms that occur from childhood to adulthood. Usually, the first clinical 
sign is non-autoimmune diabetes even if other clinical features (optic 
subatrophy, neurosensorial deafness, diabetes insipidus) may be present in an 
early state and may be diagnosed after diabetes' onset. Prognosis is poor, and 
the death occurs at the median age of 39 years as a consequence of progressive 
respiratory impairment, secondary to brain atrophy and neurological failure. The 
aim of this paper is the description of the metabolic treatment of the WS. We 
reported the experience of long treatment in patients with this syndrome 
diagnosed in pediatric age and followed also in adult age. It is known that 
there is a correlation between metabolic control of diabetes, the onset of other 
associated symptoms, and the progression of the neurodegenerative alterations. 
Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to prevent, treat 
and carefully monitor all the comorbidities that may occur. An extensive 
understanding of WS from pathophysiology to novel possible therapy is 
fundamental and further studies are needed to better manage this devastating 
disease and to guarantee to patients a better quality of life and a longer life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Understanding and managing the impacts of population growth and 
densification are important steps for sustainable development. This study sought 
to evaluate the health trade-offs associated with increasing densification and 
to identify the optimal balance of neighbourhood densification for health.
METHODS: We linked population density with a 27-year mortality dataset in Metro 
Vancouver that includes census-tract levels of life expectancy (LE), 
cause-specific mortalities, and area-level deprivation. We applied two methods: 
(1) difference-in-differences (DID) models to study the impacts of densification 
changes from the early 1990s on changes in mortality over a 27-year period; and 
(2) smoothed cubic splines to identify thresholds of densification at which 
mortality rates accelerated.
RESULTS: At densities above ~9400 persons per km2, LE began to decrease more 
rapidly. By cause, densification was linked to decreased mortality for major 
causes of mortality in the region, such as cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, 
and diabetes. Greater inequality with increasing density was observed for causes 
such as human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(HIV/AIDS), sexually transmitted infections, and self-harm and interpersonal 
violence.
CONCLUSIONS: Areas with higher population densities generally have lower rates 
of mortality from the major causes, but these environments are also associated 
with higher relative inequality from largely preventable causes of death.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is 
a large threat to human health and is challenging to address. This study aims to 
determine if motor intervention is a possibility for promoting the life 
expectancy and quality of life of children with HIV. The group consisted of 22 
participants: 11 HIV-infected (51.73 months, SD 10.15) and 11 HIV-affected 
children (44.45 months, SD 10.76). A two-group (intervention and control group) 
pre-test−post-test research design was followed. The HIV-infected and affected 
children were randomly matched and grouped into an intervention and control 
group. The intervention group participated in a 12-week motor intervention of 60 
min per session, twice per week. The effect of the program was analyzed with 
regard to motor skills, as established by the PDMS-2 and two strength 
capabilities. An ANCOVA adjusted for pre-test differences (p < 0.05) indicated 
statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) with large practical 
significance (d > 0.8) in locomotor, fine motor and overall motor skills. The 
infected children also showed better improvement compared to the affected 
children. Motor intervention is recommended in the health care path of children 
affected and infected with HIV, although modifications for improvement of the 
program are suggested, based on the results attained.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this scoping review was to summarise the current 
evidence for peer-to-peer support and its impact on quality of life (QoL) in 
head and neck cancer (HNC).
METHODS: Five search engines were used-PubMed, CINAHL, APA PyscInfo, Web of 
Science and HaNDLE-on-QoL-to look for publications between 1981 and 2020. 
Adapted PICO (population, intervention, comparator and outcome) and Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) methodology was used.
RESULTS: Of the 1408 papers identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria: five 
qualitative, two cross-sectional, one case-control, one cohort and one 
quasi-experimental design. There were four common themes: patient experience of 
peer-to-peer support, delivery of peer-to-peer support, engagement with 
peer-to-peer support and impact on QoL.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the paucity of evidence with regard to QoL 
and peer-to-peer support in HNC. It provides a summary of the literature and 
identifies considerations for clinical practice and future research.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is becoming an important indicator of 
population health. While actuarial estimates of HLE are frequently studied, 
there is scarcity of research on the subjective expectations of people about 
their HLE. The objective of this study is to compare actuarial and subjective 
HLE (sHLE) estimates in the ≥50-year-old Hungarian general population. 
Furthermore, we assessed subjective life expectancy (sLE) and explored 
determinants of the individual variance of sHLE and sLE.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in 2019. Subjective health 
expectations were measured at 60, 70, 80 and 90 years of age via the Global 
Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). Point-estimates of sLE and background 
variables were also recorded. sHLE was estimated from GALI and sLE responses. 
Actuarial estimates of life expectancy (LE) and HLE for 2019 were provided by 
the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
RESULTS: Five hundred and four respondents (female 51.6%) were included. Mean 
(±SD) age was 63 (±7.5) years. Median LE (81.5 years, 95%CI 81.1-81.7) and sLE 
(82 years, 95%CI 80-85) were similar (p = 0.142), while median sHLE (66.8 years, 
95%CI 65.5-68.3) was lower than HLE (72.7 years, 95%CI 82.4-82.9) by 5.9 years 
(p<0.001). Despite the greater median actuarial LE of women compared to men 
(p<0.001), we found no gender differences between the median sLE (p = 0.930), 
HLE (p = 0.417) and sHLE (p = 0.403) values. With less apparent gender 
differences among the predictors when compared to sLE, sHLE was mainly 
determined by self-perceived health, age and place of residence, while 
self-perceived health, close relatives' longevity, social conditions, happiness 
and perceived lifestyle influenced sLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Along subjective life expectancy, subjective healthy life 
expectancy may be a feasible indicator and provide insights to individuals' 
subjective expectations underlying the demographic estimates of the healthy life 
expectancy of the population.

Impact of history of mental disorders on short-term mortality among hospitalized 
patients with sepsis: A population-based cohort study.

Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at the Permian Basin,

Texas, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are associated with markedly reduced life 
expectancy, in part due to an increased risk of death due to infection, likely 
reflecting sepsis-associated mortality. Patients with mental disorders are at an 
increased risk of sepsis, but data on the prognostic impact of mental disorders 
in sepsis are sparse, showing conflicting findings.
METHODS: We used statewide data to identify hospitalizations aged ≥18 years with 
sepsis in Texas during 2014-2017. Mental disorders, including mood, anxiety, 
psychosis, and personality disorders were identified using Clinical 
Classification Software codes. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression 
with propensity adjustment (primary model), with propensity score matching, and 
multivariable logistic regression as alternative models, were used to estimate 
the association between mental disorders and short-term mortality (defined as 
in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice). Additional models were fitted 
for sensitivity analyses and to estimate the prognostic associations of 
individual categories of mental disorders.
RESULTS: Among 283,025 hospitalizations with sepsis, 56,904 (20.1%) had mental 
disorders. Hospitalizations with vs without mental disorders were younger (age 
18-44 years 12.2% vs 10.6%), more commonly white (61.0% vs 49.8%), with lower 
burden of comorbidities (mean [SD] Deyo comorbidity index 2.53 [2.27] vs 2.73 
[2.47]), and with lower need for organ support (mechanical ventilation 32.8% vs 
36.0%); p<0.0001 for all comparisons. Crude short-term mortality among sepsis 
hospitalizations with and without mental disorders was 25.0% vs 32.8%, 
respectively. On adjusted analyses, mental disorders remained associated with 
lower odds of short-term mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.792 [95% CI 
0.772-0.812]). This finding was consistent on the alternative modeling 
approaches, sensitivity analyses, and examination of individual categories of 
mental disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders were associated, unexpectedly, with markedly lower 
risk of short-term mortality in sepsis. Further studies to examine the 
mechanisms underlying these findings may inform future efforts to improve sepsis 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Aim of this study is to evaluate long-term results in abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery by either open aortic repair (OAR) or endovascular 
aortic repair (EVAR) in patients under 70 years of age.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 
patients with age under 70 years old undergoing elective infrarenal AAA surgery 
between 2010 and 2018 was performed. The study population was divided into 2 
groups: OAR and EVAR. Primary end points were overall survival and 
aneurysm-related death, while secondary outcomes were need for reintervention 
and development of minor and major complications.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one patients younger than 70 years old treated with 
elective AAA surgery were enrolled: 157 OAR (98% males, mean age 65 ± 4 years) 
and 34 EVAR (94% males, mean age 66 ± 4 years). Hospital stay, 30-day mortality, 
and need for reintervention were similar; OAR population presented higher 
incidence of postoperative major complications (18% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.01) while 
minor complications were 32% in the OAR versus 21% in the EVAR group (P = 0.08). 
Median follow-up was 69 months for OAR (interquartile range [IQR] 53 months) vs. 
79 months (IQR 51 months) for EVAR (P = 0.9): long-term AAA-related 
reinterventions were more frequent after EVAR (1.9% OAR vs. 17% EVAR; P = 0.01) 
while AAA-related long-term mortality was similar in both subgroups (1.3% OAR 
and 3% EVAR; P = 0.8). At univariate analysis higher risk of reintervention was 
reported for conical necks in the EVAR group (P = 0.03) and for the concomitant 
presence of iliac aneurysms in both groups (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, EVAR in young patients is presenting an 
excessive rate of reintervention compared to OAR. The presence of conical neck 
is an independent predictor of EVAR failure and late reintervention, while it 
does not play a significant role in the OAR group. Open surgery should be 
considered the first option in younger patients with a long-life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular surgery leads to postsurgical muscle weakness, 
probably because of muscle proteolysis and peripheral nerve dysfunction, which 
are augmented by aging and diabetes mellitus.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) 
on postsurgical muscle weakness in older individuals with diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial, and screened 
consecutive patients with diabetes who underwent cardiovascular surgery for 
eligibility (age ≥ 65 years). Those included were randomly assigned to the NMES 
or the sham group. The primary outcome was the percent change in isometric knee 
extension strength (%ΔIKES) from preoperative to postoperative day 7. Secondary 
outcomes were the percent change in usual (%ΔUWS), maximum walking speed 
(%ΔMWS), and grip strength (%ΔGS). A statistician who was blinded to group 
allocation used intention-to-treat analysis (student t test).
RESULTS: Of 1151 participants screened for eligibility, 180 (NMES, n = 90; sham, 
n = 90) were included in the primary analysis. %ΔIKES was significantly lower in 
the NMES than sham group (NMES: mean -2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -6 to 1; 
sham: -13%, 95% CI -17 to -9, p < 0.001). Among the secondary outcomes, %ΔMWS 
was significantly lower and %ΔUWS and %ΔGS were lower, although not 
significantly, in the NMES than sham group.
CONCLUSIONS: A short course of NMES (< 1 week) mitigated postsurgical muscle 
weakness and functional decline in older persons with diabetes mellitus. NMES 
could be recommended as a part of postsurgical rehabilitation in older people 
with diabetes mellitus, especially those with a low functional reserve.

Elder suicide is a significant public health issue in many countries. This 
reflects the complex underlying psychosocial, mental and physical health issues 
that older adults face. Increased life expectancy in developing countries has 
resulted in a gradual transition to an ageing population. Furthermore, in 
countries such as Sri Lanka, the transition occurs at a lower per capita income 
than in developed countries. This will negatively impact the availability of 
resources and service delivery to at-risk individuals. Thus, addressing elder 
suicide and concerns of elders are timely issues. This paper looks at the 
underlying risk factors associated with elder suicide and strategies that can be 
implemented in preventing elder suicide in the South Asian context, with 
reference to Sri Lanka.

Is Delaying Urogynecologic Surgery for Patients With Elevated Hemoglobin A1C 
High-Value Care?

OBJECTIVE: Poor glycemic control is a risk factor for surgical complications. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of immediate versus delayed pelvic 
reconstructive surgery for women with hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) greater than 8%.
METHODS: We designed a decision tree model from a health care sector perspective 
to compare costs and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of 3 
strategies: patients with HbA1c greater than 8% can undergo (1) immediate 
surgery, (2) delay surgery 6 months, or (3) delay surgery until HbA1c is less 
than 8%. Groups 2 and 3 undergo treatments to improve glycemic control. Our 
primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Time horizon was 1 
year.
RESULTS: In the base case, immediate surgery compared with delaying surgery 
until HbA1c <8% had higher costs ($13,775 vs $6,622) and health utilities (0.78 
vs 0.76). Immediate surgery was not cost effective (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, $347,132/QALY). Delaying surgery for 6 months (group 
2) was dominated (higher cost and lower effectiveness). For patients with either 
severe prolapse resulting in QALY less than 0.71 (base case 0.75), QALY after 
surgery greater than 0.84 (base case, 0.80), or the probability of complications 
with elevated HbA1c less than 17% (base case, 27%), immediate surgery became 
cost effective. Monte Carlo simulations showed that delaying surgery until HbA1c 
is less than 8% had a 58% chance of being the preferred strategy at a 
willingness-to-pay of $150,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with HbA1c greater than 8%, delaying surgery until 
improved glycemic control is generally cost-effective. Surgery should not be 
delayed for a prespecified period. Immediate surgery can be cost-effective for 
patients with severe prolapse or if complication rates decrease to 60% of 
currently reported rates.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis 
comparing the management for ongoing voiding dysfunction after midurethral sling 
placement, including early sling loosening and delayed sling lysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of early 
sling loosening (2 weeks) versus delayed sling lysis (6 weeks) for the 
management of persisting voiding dysfunction/retention after midurethral sling 
placement. A literature review provided rates of resolution of voiding 
dysfunction with conservative management, complications, recurrent stress 
urinary incontinence, or ongoing retention, as well as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Costs were based on 2020 Medicare reimbursement rates. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared using a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: At 1 year, early sling loosening resulted in increased costs ($3,575 vs 
$1,836) and higher QALYs (0.948 vs 0.925) compared with delayed sling lysis. 
This translated to early sling loosening being the most cost-effective strategy, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,382/QALY. The model was 
sensitive to multiple variables on our 1-way sensitivity analysis. For example, 
delayed sling lysis became cost-effective if the rate of voiding dysfunction 
resolution with conservative management was greater than or equal to 57% or 
recurrent stress urinary incontinence after early loosening was greater than or 
equal to 9.6%. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000/QALY, early sling 
loosening was cost-effective in 82% of microsimulations in probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Early sling loosening represents a more cost-effective management 
method in resolving ongoing voiding dysfunction after sling placement. These 
findings may favor early clinical management in patients with voiding 
dysfunction after midurethral sling placement.

OBJECTIVES: To use data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) to estimate mortality and disability trends for 
the population aged ≥70 and evaluate patterns in causes of death, disability, 
and risk factors.
DESIGN: Systematic analysis.
SETTING: Participants were aged ≥70 from 204 countries and territories, 
1990-2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Years of life lost, years lived with disability, 
disability adjusted life years, life expectancy at age 70 (LE-70), healthy life 
expectancy at age 70 (HALE-70), proportion of years in ill health at age 70 
(PYIH-70), risk factors, and data coverage index were estimated based on 
standardised GBD methods.
RESULTS: Globally the population of older adults has increased since 1990 and 
all cause death rates have decreased for men and women. However, mortality rates 
due to falls increased between 1990 and 2019. The probability of death among 
people aged 70-90 decreased, mainly because of reductions in non-communicable 
diseases. Globally disability burden was largely driven by functional decline, 
vision and hearing loss, and symptoms of pain. LE-70 and HALE-70 showed 
continuous increases since 1990 globally, with certain regional disparities. 
Globally higher LE-70 resulted in higher HALE-70 and slightly increased PYIH-70. 
Sociodemographic and healthcare access and quality indices were positively 
correlated with HALE-70 and LE-70. For high exposure risk factors, data coverage 
was moderate, while limited data were available for various dietary, 
environmental or occupational, and metabolic risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy at age 70 has continued to rise globally, mostly 
because of decreases in chronic diseases. Adults aged ≥70 living in high income 
countries and regions with better healthcare access and quality were found to 
experience the highest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Disability 
burden, however, remained constant, suggesting the need to enhance public health 
and intervention programmes to improve wellbeing among older adults.

Native Hawaiians are proud and resilient people who have endured significant 
impacts from colonization. Despite being in a time of vibrant cultural 
revitalization, Native Hawaiians have a shorter life expectancy than other 
racial and ethnic groups in Hawai'i. The primary aim of this paper was to share 
data from the first year of a 5-year study with Native Hawaiian kūpuna (elders) 
on their experiences with healthcare, along with barriers to accessing 
healthcare. Ten kūpuna living in rural areas of Hawai'i participated in three 
interviews each, which were held in an informal, talk-story style. The first 
interview focused on establishing rapport. The second interview focused on the 
kūpuna's strengths, resiliencies, and what they would like to pass to the next 
generation. The third interview focused on the elders' experiences with 
healthcare, which is the focus of this paper. All ten kūpuna reported growing up 
with limited access to Western healthcare; rather, their families successfully 
treated many illnesses and injuries with lā'au lapa'au (Hawaiian herbal 
medicine) and other traditional healing practices, as they had done for 
generations. As Western medicine became more prevalent and accessible, they used 
both, but many preferred holistic treatments such as prayer, a return to the 
traditional diet, and lā'au lapa'au. As a group, the kūpuna rated their health 
as fair to good; two had diabetes, two had cardiovascular disease, four had 
neuropathies, and five were cancer survivors. The kūpuna reported high turnover 
among providers in rural communities. Limited access to specialists often 
required them to travel to Honolulu for care, which was costly and especially 
difficult during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regardless of provider 
ethnicity, the kūpuna appreciated those who took the time to get to know them as 
people and respected Hawaiian cultural practices. They advised that Western 
providers speak honestly and directly, have compassion, and build connections to 
patients and their communities.

BACKGROUND: Due to an increasing life expectancy, more and more patients 
experience the failure of peripheral arterial revascularization. This study aims 
to investigate patients treated for the failure of infra-inguinal bypass grafts, 
and to investigate the interaction of different bypass materials [great 
saphenous vein (GSV) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)] and the further 
outcome.
METHODS: Retrospective single-center analysis of consecutive patients treated 
for acute or chronic occlusion of infra-inguinal bypasses at a university 
hospital was conducted. Hospitalizations from 1st January 2010 through 31st 
December 2019 were included. Perioperative parameters from the index operation 
including graft material (prosthetic vs. autologous) were assessed. After bypass 
occlusion, the grade of ischemia, as well as the distal landing zone of the redo 
bypass compared with the primary bypass was investigated.
RESULTS: In this study, 158 (65% men and 35% women with a m mean age of 70.5 
years) eligible patients were included (57% vein and 42% prosthetic bypass 
grafts). After graft occlusion, 47% of the patients presented with symptoms of 
acute limb-threatening ischemia, 53% with symptoms of chronic leg ischemia. The 
rate of acute limb-threatening ischemia was significantly higher when prosthetic 
graft material was used during the index operation (p =0.016). Additionally, in 
case of reoperation, the landing zone of the redo bypass was significantly more 
distally located after occlusion of prosthetic bypass graft (p = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Occlusions of prosthetic bypass grafts were associated with 
significantly higher rates of acute symptoms compared with vein grafts. 
Additionally, a shift to a more distal landing zone was recognized after the 
failure of a prosthetic bypass graft during the redo bypass operation.

vasoactive drug (VAD) support is controversial. This study assesses the 
tolerability and safety of EN in such patients.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in 23 intensive care 
units (ICUs) over 30 months. Inclusion criteria were a need for VADs and/or 
mechanic circulatory support (MCS) over a minimum of 48 h, a need for ≥48 h of 
mechanical ventilation, an estimated life expectancy >72 h, and ≥72 h of ICU 
stay. Patients with refractory shock were excluded. EN was performed according 
to established protocols during which descriptive, daily hemodynamic and 
efficacy, and safety data were collected. An independent research group 
conducted the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of 200 patients included, 30 (15%) required MCS and 145 (73%) met early 
multiorgan dysfunction criteria. Mortality was 24%. Patients needed a mean dose 
of norepinephrine in the first 48 h of 0.71 mcg/kg/min (95% CI, 0.63-0.8) 
targeting a mean arterial pressure of 68 mm Hg (95% CI, 67-70) during the first 
48 h. EN was started 34 h (95% CI, 31-37) after ICU admission. Mean energy and 
protein delivered by EN/patient/day were 1159 kcal (95% CI, 1098-1220) and 
55.6 g (95% CI, 52.4-58.7), respectively. Daily energy balance during 
EN/patient/day was -432 (95% CI, -496 to -368). One hundred and fifty-four (77%) 
patients experienced EN-related complications. However, severe complications, 
such as mesenteric ischemia, were recorded in only one (0.5%) patient.
CONCLUSION: EN in these patients seems feasible, safe, and unrelated to serious 
complications. Reaching the energy target only through EN is difficult.

We demonstrate the potential of a novel self-expandable biliary stent comprised 
of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel with anisotropic swelling behavior and 
endoscopic deliverability in vivo, using a porcine stent model. The mechanism 
underlying the anisotropic swelling behavior and endoscopic deliverability 
(i.e., flexibility) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), evaluation of the water content and 
swelling ratio, and three-point bending tests. The in vivo experiment using a 
porcine stent model indicated that the tube-shaped PVA hydrogel could 
effectively expand the biliary tract, without disturbing bile flow. SEM and SAXS 
showed that PVA hydrogels prepared by drying under extension showed structural 
orientation along the extension axis, leading to anisotropic swelling. The water 
content of the PVA hydrogel was found to be crucial for maintaining flexibility 
as well as endoscopic deliverability. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the 
novel concept of using a hydrogel stent as a self-expandable biliary stent.
