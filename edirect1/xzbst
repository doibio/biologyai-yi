(TCF)-binding element of the cyclin D1 promoter and activates its transcription. 
Interestingly, telomerase is also recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter in a 
TERC-dependent manner through the interaction with NOL1, further enhancing 
transcription of the cyclin D1 gene. Depletion of NOL1 suppresses cyclin D1 
promoter activity, thereby leading to induction of growth arrest and altered 
cell cycle distributions. Collectively, our findings suggest that NOL1 
represents a new route by which telomerase activates transcription of cyclin D1 
gene, thus maintaining cell proliferation capacity.

BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common side effect of cancer treatments and can lead to 
a reduction in quality of life. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are 
licensed for use in conjunction with red blood cell transfusions to improve 
cancer treatment-induced anaemia (CIA).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ESAs in 
anaemia associated with cancer treatment (specifically chemotherapy).
DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched from 2004 to 2013: The 
Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature, British Nursing Index, Health Management Information Consortium, 
Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. The US Food and Drug 
Administration and European Medicines Agency websites were also searched. 
Bibliographies of included papers were scrutinised for further potentially 
includable studies.
REVIEW METHODS: The clinical effectiveness review followed principles published 
by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs), or systematic reviews of RCTs, of ESAs (epoetin or darbepoetin) for 
treating people with CIA were eligible for inclusion in the review. Comparators 
were best supportive care, placebo or other ESAs. Anaemia- and 
malignancy-related outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adverse 
events (AEs) were evaluated. When appropriate, data were pooled using 
meta-analysis. An empirical health economic model was developed comparing ESA 
treatment with no ESA treatment. The model comprised two components: one 
evaluating short-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (while 
patients are anaemic) and one evaluating long-term QALYs. Costs and benefits 
were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Probabilistic and univariate deterministic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of 1457 titles and abstracts screened, 23 studies assessing ESAs within 
their licensed indication (based on start dose administered) were included in 
the review. None of the RCTs were completely aligned with current European Union 
licenses. The results suggest a clinical benefit from ESAs for anaemia-related 
outcomes and an improvement in HRQoL scores. The impact of ESAs on AEs and 
survival remains highly uncertain, although point estimates are lower, 
confidence intervals are wide and not statistically significant. Base-case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for ESA treatment compared with no 
ESA treatment ranged from £ 19,429 to £ 35,018 per QALY gained, but sensitivity 
and scenario analyses demonstrate considerable uncertainty in these ICERs, 
including the possibility of overall health disbenefit. All ICERs were sensitive 
to survival and cost.
LIMITATIONS: The relative effectiveness of ESAs was not addressed; all ESAs were 
assumed to have equivalent efficacy. No studies were completely aligned with 
their European labelling beyond the starting dose evaluated. There is 
questionable generalisability given that the included trials were published >20 
years ago and there have been many changes to chemotherapy as well as to the 
quality of supportive treatment. Trial quality was moderate or poor and there 
was considerable unexplained heterogeneity for a number of outcomes, 
particularly survival, and evidence of publication bias. Adjustments were not 
made to account for multiple testing.
CONCLUSIONS: ESAs could be cost-effective when used closer to licence, but there 
is considerable uncertainty, mainly because of unknown impacts on overall 
survival.

Malaria is one of the highest contributors to morbidity and mortality in 
Zimbabwe. However, there is paucity of knowledge regarding disability adjusted 
life years (DALYs) as a measure of burden of malaria in affected communities. 
The DALYs metric was used to assess the burden of malaria in Gwanda District 
with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of the impact of disease 
on affected communities. Data was collected from health facility malaria 
registers and the District Health Information System (DHIS) to estimate DALYs at 
household and district levels respectively. The household DALYs included 130 
malaria cases from 2013 to 2015 while the DALYs for the district included 719 
confirmed malaria cases from 2011 to 2015. Households lost a total of 153.89 
DALYs with the majority of the disease burden (65.55%) occurring in the most 
economically productive age group (15-45 years) with a mean loss of 1.18 DALYs 
per malaria case. At district level, 251.09 DALYs were lost due to malaria and 
the calculated average district DALY rate for 2011-2015 was 36.29 DALYs/100,000 
persons per year. It is important to estimate malaria burden to assist policy 
makers in making informed decisions when channelling resources for control and 
prevention of the disease.

PURPOSE: Bedaquiline is a new drug used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
adding bedaquiline to a standard regimen (SR) for treating patients with MDR-TB, 
including extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB, in the Republic of Korea.
METHODS: A cohort-based decision-analytic model developed in a previously 
published study from the United Kingdom was used, with a 20-year time horizon 
and a 5% discount rate for cost and effectiveness, to evaluate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of bedaquiline + SR and SR only. The key parameters 
regarding the clinical data were available via the published Phase II trial of 
bedaquiline. Additional parameters for recurrence, cure status, loss to 
follow-up, surgery, death, cost, and health utility were based on Korean data if 
available; otherwise the international literature data were applied. Univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
FINDINGS: Based on the analysis, a patient on bedaquiline + SR would gain 1.20 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 13,961,659 Korean won (KRW) (1100 KRW = 
US $1) of additional cost compared with a patient administered SR only, with an 
incremental cost/utility ratio of 11,638,656 KRW/QALY. Bedaquiline + SR had an 
80% probability of being cost-effective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 26 
million KRW, compared with SR only.
IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study suggest that, in the Republic of Korea, 
bedaquiline, as a part of combination therapy with SR, is a cost-effective 
option for the treatment of MDR-TB (including XDR-TB) compared with SR only.

Airway stent: what is new and what should be discarded.

Herth FJ(1), Eberhardt R.

Author information:

Translational Lung Research Center Heidelberg, German Center for Lung Research 
(DZL), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with lung cancer often develop endobronchial 
disease, endobronchial tumor extension or airway compression. Various 
nonmalignant diseases can also lead to severe central airway obstruction.Since 
the early 1980s, technical advances of interventional bronchoscopic techniques 
have improved symptom-free survival and quality of life for patients with lung 
cancer. Apart from other techniques, various airway stents have been developed. 
Although interventional procedures are not definitive therapies, they often 
relieve the strangling sensation produced by airway occlusion. There have been 
various new developments and the authors review the available current literature 
on endobronchial stents
RECENT FINDINGS: For patients with respiratory symptoms because of malignant 
airway obstruction, stent placement provides symptom palliation and improved 
quality of life.
SUMMARY: Various options for central airway obstruction are in development and 
will change our daily work. In particular, coated stents have a large potential 
in minimizing stent complications.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In Spain, 0.3% of patients with hypertension are 
refractory to conventional treatment. The complications resulting from deficient 
control of this condition can lead to poor quality of life for the patient and 
considerable health care costs. Barostim is an implantable device designed to 
lower blood pressure in these patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of Barostim compared with drug therapy in hypertensive 
patients refractory to conventional treatment (at least 3 antihypertensive 
drugs, including 1 diuretic agent).
METHODS: We used a Markov model adapted to the epidemiology of the Spanish 
population to simulate the natural history of a cohort of patients with 
refractory hypertension over their lifetime. Data on the effectiveness of the 
treatments studied were obtained from the literature, and data on costs were 
taken from hospital administrative databases and official sources. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Barostim increased the number of quality-adjusted life years by 0.78 
and reduced the number of hypertension-associated clinical events. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in a cohort of men reached 68 726 euros per 
year of quality-adjusted life. One of the main elements that makes this 
technology costly is the need for battery replacement. The results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Barostim is not a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of 
refractory hypertension in Spain. The cost-effectiveness ratio could be improved 
by future reductions in the cost of the battery.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Cutler and Levine performed the first 
successful surgical treatment of a stenotic mitral valve, which was the only 
treatable heart valve defect at that time. Mitral valve surgery has evolved 
significantly since then. The introduction of the heart-lung machine in 1954 not 
only reduced the surgical risk, but also allowed the treatment of different 
mitral valve pathologies. Nowadays, mitral valve insufficiency has become the 
most common underlying pathomechanism of mitral valve disease and can be 
classified into primary and secondary mitral insufficiency. Primary mitral valve 
insufficiency is mainly caused by alterations of the valve (leaflets and primary 
order chords) itself, whereas left ventricular dilatation leading to papillary 
muscle displacement and leaflet tethering via second order chords is the main 
underlying pathomechanism for secondary mitral valve regurgitation. Valve 
reconstruction using the "loop technique" plus annuloplasty is the surgical 
strategy of choice and normalizes life expectancy in patients with primary 
mitral regurgitation. In patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, 
implanting an annuloplasty is not superior to valve replacement and results in 
high rates of valve re-insufficiency (up to 30 % after 3 months) due to ongoing 
ventricular dilatation. In order to improve repair results in these patients, we 
add a novel subvalvular technique (ring-noose-string) to the annuloplasty that 
aims to prevent ongoing ventricular remodeling and re-insufficiency. In modern 
mitral surgery, a right lateral thoracotomy is the approach of choice with 
excellent repair and cosmetic results.

    Trends Cardiovasc Med. 2016 Jul;26(5):429-32.

Over the past 4 decades, remarkable progress in understanding the cause, 
pathogenesis, and management of the MFS has led to an increase in life 
expectancy to near normal for most patients. Accompanying this increased life 
span has been the emergence of previously rare or unanticipated clinical 
problems. Despite much more detailed knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and 
tissue effects of a mutation in FBN1, targeted, effective therapy remains 
elusive. Until such precision medicine takes hold, management will depend on 
early diagnosis, regular scrutiny by imaging, chronic β-blockade, and perhaps 
ARBs, and prophylactic cardiothoracic surgery. Without question, MFS will remain 
a fertile subject for basic, translational, and clinical research for the 
foreseeable future.

Massachusetts Health Reform Cost Less and Was More Effective for Uninsured 
Individuals With Venous Thromboembolism: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Management, Division of General Internal Medicine ∥Section of Decision Sciences 
and Clinical Systems Modeling, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 
Pittsburgh, PA.

BACKGROUND: Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) require access to 
comprehensive physician and pharmacy benefits to prevent recurrence and 
hemorrhage. Before 2006, Massachusetts provided these benefits through a program 
restricted to safety net hospitals called Free Care. Providing portable health 
insurance through Massachusetts health reform could improve outcomes for 
uninsured with VTE but its cost-effectiveness is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed a Markov decision analysis model comparing 
our conceptualization of the Massachusetts health reform (health reform 
strategy) to no health reform strategy for a patient beginning warfarin for new 
episode of VTE. In the model, a patient may develop recurrent VTE or develop 
hemorrhage or stop warfarin after 6 months if no event occurs. To measure 
effectiveness, we analyzed laboratory data from Boston Medical Center, the 
largest safety net hospital in Massachusetts. Specifically, we measured the 
probability of having a subtherapeutic warfarin level for patients newly insured 
compared with those on Free Care prereform adjusting for secular trends. To 
calculate inpatient costs, we used the Health Care Utilization Project. We then 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the health reform 
strategy adjusted to 2014 USD per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
performed sensitivity analyses. The health reform strategy cost less and gained 
more QALYs than the no health reform strategy. Our result was most sensitive to 
the odds that Health Reform protected against a subtherapeutic warfarin level, 
the cost of Health Reform, and the percentage of total health care costs 
attributable to VTE in Massachusetts.
CONCLUSION: The health reform strategy cost less and was more effective than the 
no health reform strategy for patients with VTE.

Re-irradiation of painful bony metastases is increasingly performed since 
patients are receiving better systemic treatments and having longer life 
expectancy, and may also be due to the increase use of initial single fraction 
radiotherapy. However, randomized control trial on the efficacy of 
re-irradiation is lacking. A recent meta-analysis concluded with a 58% response 
rate for pain relief by re-irradiation of symptomatic bone metastases. In this 
review, the effectiveness of re-irradiation in terms of clinical and economical 
aspects, and clinical questions on who, when, and how to re-irradiate would be 
discussed. A brief review of other treatment options and comparison with 
re-irradiation of bone metastases would be performed.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs; pathologic fracture, radiation or 
surgery to bone, spinal cord compression) frequently occur in patients with 
advanced cancer with bone metastases/lesions. Limited data on the associated 
patient and economic burden are available to aid in resource planning and 
evaluating treatment options.
METHODS: Patients with bone metastases/lesions secondary to breast, lung or 
prostate cancer or multiple myeloma; with at least one SRE within 97 days prior 
to enrollment; life expectancy of at least 6 months; and Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2 were recruited. Information on 
health resource utilization (HRU; including number/duration of hospitalizations, 
outpatient visits, procedures), attributed by investigators to be associated 
with a SRE, was collected retrospectively for up to 97 days prior to enrollment 
and prospectively for up to 18-21 months.
RESULTS: A total of 631 patients contributing 1282 SREs, were enrolled across 
Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Approximately a third of all SREs 
required an inpatient stay. Mean duration of inpatient stay for patients with 
SREs requiring one ranged from 8.4 to 41.1 days across all countries and SRE 
types.
CONCLUSION: All types of SREs are associated with substantial HRU burden. 
Preventing SREs by using the best therapeutic options available may help to 
reduce the burden to patients and healthcare systems.

OBJECTIVES: The BRIDGE study has previously shown a high short-term (12 weeks) 
adherence rate (>85%) of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) to subcutaneous self-injections of interferon β-1a using an electronic 
auto-injection device (RebiSmart®). The primary goal of the RIVER study was to 
investigate in a real-life setting the long-term adherence to the use of 
RebiSmart among patients enrolled in the parent BRIDGE study.
METHODS: The RIVER study was designed as a real-life extension study of the 
BRIDGE trial. RRMS patients who completed BRIDGE and still had an indication for 
treatment were included. Data were collected prospectively through the RebiSmart 
device, and analyzed retrospectively. Long term adherence (administration of ≥ 
80% of injections) to and safety of RebiSmart were assessed. The expected 
follow-up period ranged from 19 to 26 months.
RESULTS: A total of 57 RRMS patients participated in the follow-up study. The 
mean observation period was 20.5 ± 5.7 months. The overall adherence to the use 
of RebiSmart in the entire study cohort was 79.8% (median = 85.2%, 
range = 16-100%). There were 36 patients (63.2%) who completed at least 80% of 
the scheduled injections. No statistically significant differences were found 
between adherent and non-adherent patients in terms of age, sex, duration of the 
observation period, and occurrence of relapses. No serious treatment-related 
adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high level of long-term adherence to the use of 
RebiSmart, with 63.2% of participants meeting the criterion for adherence to 
treatment.

In this study, we compared the efficiency of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 
sequence specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP) markers for analyzing genetic 
diversity, genetic relationships, and population structure of 87 super sweet 
corn inbred lines from different origins. SSR markers showed higher average gene 
diversity and Shannon's information index than SSAP markers. To assess genetic 
relationships and characterize inbred lines using SSR and SSAP markers, genetic 
similarity (GS) matrices were constructed. The dendrogram using SSR marker data 
showed a complex pattern with nine clusters and a GS of 53.0%. For SSAP markers, 
three clusters were observed with a GS of 50.8%. Results of combined marker data 
showed six clusters with 53.5% GS. To analyze the genetic population structure 
of SSR and SSAP marker data, the 87 inbred lines were divided into groups I, II, 
and admixed based on the membership probability threshold of 0.8. Using combined 
marker data, the population structure was K = 3 and was divided into groups I, 
II, III, and admixed. This study represents a comparative analysis of SSR and 
SSAP marker data for the study of genetic diversity and genetic relationships in 
super sweet corn inbred lines. Our results would be useful for maize-breeding 
programs in Korea.

Molecular properties of the N-terminal extension of the fission yeast kinesin-5, 
Cut7.

University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

Kinesin-5 plays an essential role in spindle formation and function, and serves 
as a potential target for anti-cancer drugs. The aim of this study was to 
elucidate the molecular properties of the N-terminal extension of the 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe kinesin-5, Cut7. This extension is rich in charged 
amino acids and predicted to be intrinsically disordered. In S. pombe cells, a 
Cut7 construct lacking half the N-terminal extension failed to localize along 
the spindle microtubules and formed a monopolar spindle. However, a construct 
lacking the entire N-terminal extension exhibited normal localization and formed 
a typical bipolar spindle. In addition, in vitro analyses revealed that the 
truncated Cut7 constructs demonstrated similar motile velocities and 
directionalities as the wild-type motor protein, but the microtubule landing 
rates were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that the N-terminal 
extension is not required for normal Cut7 intracellular localization or 
function, but alters the microtubule-binding properties of this protein in 
vitro.

BACKGROUND: Collaborative care is effective for depression management in the 
USA. There is little UK evidence on its clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
collaborative care compared with usual care in the management of patients with 
moderate to severe depression.
DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: UK primary care practices (n = 51) in three UK primary care districts.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 581 adults aged ≥ 18 years in general practice with a 
current International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition depressive 
episode, excluding acutely suicidal people, those with psychosis, bipolar 
disorder or low mood associated with bereavement, those whose primary 
presentation was substance abuse and those receiving psychological treatment.
INTERVENTIONS: Collaborative care: 14 weeks of 6-12 telephone contacts by care 
managers; mental health specialist supervision, including depression education, 
medication management, behavioural activation, relapse prevention and primary 
care liaison. Usual care was general practitioner standard practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded researchers collected depression [Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)], anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and quality of 
life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions three-level version), Short Form 
questionnaire-36 items) outcomes at 4, 12 and 36 months, satisfaction (Client 
Satisfaction Questionnaire-8) outcomes at 4 months and treatment and service use 
costs at 12 months.
RESULTS: In total, 276 and 305 participants were randomised to collaborative 
care and usual care respectively. Collaborative care participants had a mean 
depression score that was 1.33 PHQ-9 points lower [n = 230; 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.35 to 2.31; p = 0.009] than that of participants in usual care 
at 4 months and 1.36 PHQ-9 points lower (n = 275; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.64; p = 0.04) 
at 12 months after adjustment for baseline depression (effect size 0.28, 95% CI 
0.01 to 0.52; odds ratio for recovery 1.88, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.75; number needed 
to treat 6.5). Quality of mental health but not physical health was 
significantly better for collaborative care at 4 months but not at 12 months. 
There was no difference for anxiety. Participants receiving collaborative care 
were significantly more satisfied with treatment. Differences between groups had 
disappeared at 36 months. Collaborative care had a mean cost of £272.50 per 
participant with similar health and social care service use between 
collaborative care and usual care. Collaborative care offered a mean incremental 
gain of 0.02 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 12 
months at a mean incremental cost of £270.72 (95% CI -£202.98 to £886.04) and 
had an estimated mean cost per QALY of £14,248, which is below current UK 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses including informal care 
costs indicated that collaborative care is expected to be less costly and more 
effective. The amount of participant behavioural activation was the only effect 
mediator.
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care improves depression up to 12 months after 
initiation of the intervention, is preferred by patients over usual care, offers 
health gains at a relatively low cost, is cost-effective compared with usual 
care and is mediated by patient activation. Supervision was by expert clinicians 
and of short duration and more intensive therapy may have improved outcomes. In 
addition, one participant requiring inpatient treatment incurred very 
significant costs and substantially inflated our cost per QALY estimate. Future 
work should test enhanced intervention content not collaborative care per se.

PURPOSE: Deformities of the forearm and shortening of the ulna occur in 30 % of 
patients with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), leading to radial head 
dislocation and loss of movement. Several surgical techniques have been 
described for treatment, and the aim of our study was to present clinical and 
radiographic results at skeletal maturity in 15 children that underwent the 
surgical procedure of ulnar lengthening with external fixators.
METHODS: We evaluated 15 patients with ulnar shortening and radial head 
dislocation that underwent external fixation procedures. Radiographic assessment 
included measurement of radial articular angle, carpal slip, and ulnar 
shortening. Clinical evaluation included range of motion, MAYO Elbow Score, 
assessment function of the extremity as described by Stanton, the visual analog 
scale (VAS) for pain, and SF-12 to evaluate quality of life.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 77 months and took place when each 
patient had reached skeletal maturity. MAYO Elbow Score improved from 34.7 to 
93.3 points, while the average preoperative functional assessment criteria score 
was 1.6 points and improved to 4.4. The preoperative average VAS ranged from 8.2 
to 2.3, while the SF-12 in its physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components 
resulted, respectively, as 53.3 and 54.2. Pronation and supination improved from 
a preoperative average value of 35.6° and 51.3° to 70° and 80.6°, respectively, 
at the most recent follow-up visit. Flexion and extension ranged, respectively, 
from 143° and 2° to 146.7° and 3°. Ulnar shortening improved from 24 mm 
preoperative to 3 mm, and radial articular angle varied from 37.7° preoperative 
to 26° at the last follow-up. Only one complication occurred in our group, and 
one patient completely healed from a case of nonunion of the ulna.
CONCLUSIONS: Ulnar lengthening is a safe and reliable procedure for the 
treatment of HME that provides good to excellent results and reduces radial head 
dislocation.

BACKGROUND: A consensus is lacking on a uniform reconstructive algorithm for 
patients with locally advanced breast cancer who require postmastectomy 
radiotherapy. Both delayed autologous and immediate prosthetic techniques have 
inherent advantages and complications. The study hypothesis is that implants are 
more cost effective than autologous reconstruction in the setting of 
postmastectomy radiotherapy because of immediate restoration of the breast 
mound.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis model using the payer perspective was 
created comparing delayed autologous and immediate prosthetic techniques against 
the do-nothing option of mastectomy without reconstruction. Costs were obtained 
from the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Effectiveness was determined 
using the BREAST-Q patient-reported outcome measure. A breast quality-adjusted 
life-year value was considered 1 year of perfect breast health-related quality 
of life. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for both 
treatments compared with the do-nothing option.
RESULTS: BREAST-Q scores were obtained from patients who underwent immediate 
prosthetic reconstruction (n = 196), delayed autologous reconstruction (n = 76), 
and mastectomy alone (n = 71). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 
immediate prosthetic and delayed autologous reconstruction compared with 
mastectomy alone were $57,906 and $102,509, respectively. Sensitivity analysis 
showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for both treatment options 
decreased with increasing life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with advanced breast cancer who require postmastectomy 
radiotherapy, immediate prosthetic-based breast reconstruction is a 
cost-effective approach. Despite high complication rates, implant use can be 
rationalized based on low cost and health-related quality-of-life benefit 
derived from early breast mound restoration. If greater life expectancy is 
anticipated, autologous transfer is cost effective as well and may be a superior 
option.

School of Medicine, Columbia, Missouri.

CONTEXT: Population health management in the era of the Affordable Care Act 
focuses on identifying needs of health care service areas for targeted 
strategies. The United States has a "health disadvantage" compared with peer 
countries, particularly regarding obesity and women's life expectancy, while 
having high rates of mammography screening. Emphasizing lifestyle factors is a 
strategy to reduce one's risk of obesity and heart disease, as well as some 
breast cancers.
OBJECTIVE: We explored perceptions of the risk of female population-based breast 
cancer mortality compared with heart disease mortality; perceived likelihood of 
developing breast cancer; and recognition of the association between modifiable 
lifestyle factors and breast cancer risk.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey.
SETTING: Service area of one mid-Missouri health care system.
PARTICIPANTS: Female US residents ages 35 to 49 years who did not have a 
personal history of any cancer.
RESULTS: Minority women and women with a college education or less had greater 
odds of reporting that breast cancer, rather than heart disease, would cause 
more deaths in women this year. Women who had ever had a mammogram had greater 
odds of reporting a moderate/high compared with low likelihood of developing 
breast cancer. Women with less than a college education had greater odds of not 
knowing of any lifestyle behaviors or reporting only clinical behaviors related 
to reducing one's risk of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study illuminates areas of lagging information 
dissemination that may be used for targeted strategies for population health 
management in the era of the Affordable Care Act, that of bridging healthy 
lifestyle strategies for heart health with messages for breast health.

BACKGROUND: The global economic crisis imposes severe restrictions on healthcare 
budgets, limiting the coverage of new interventions, even when they are 
cost-effective. Our objective was to develop a tool that can assist 
decision-makers in comparing the impact of medical intervention alternatives on 
the entire target population, under a pre-specified budget constraint.
METHODS: We illustrated the tool by using a target population of 1,000 patients, 
and a budget constraint of $1,000,000. We compared two intervention 
alternatives: the current practice that costs $1,000 and adds 0.5 
quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) per patient and a new technology that costs 
100 % more, and provides 20 % more QALYs per patient. We also developed a 
formula for defining the maximum premium price for a 
higher-cost/higher-effectiveness intervention that can justify its adoption 
under a constrained budget.
RESULTS: Using the new therapy will add 300 QALYs, compared to 500 QALYS when 
using the lower-cost, lower-effective intervention, despite a favorable 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $10,000. The maximum price for 
the higher-efficacy therapy that will preserve the target population outcomes is 
20 % higher than the lower-cost therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Although an intervention associated with higher costs and higher 
efficacy may have an acceptable ICER, it could provide inferior outcomes in the 
target population under budget constraints, depending on the relative 
effectiveness and costs of the interventions. The cost premium that can be 
justified for a higher-efficacy intervention is directly correlated to its 
effectiveness premium. Using the proposed tool may assist decision-makers in 
improving overall healthcare outcomes, especially in times of economic downturn.

Medicalization and overdiagnosis: different but alike.

Medicalization is frequently defined as a process by which some non-medical 
aspects of human life become to be considered as medical problems. 
Overdiagnosis, on the other hand, is most often defined as diagnosing a 
biomedical condition that in the absence of testing would not cause symptoms or 
death in the person's lifetime. Medicalization and overdiagnosis are related 
concepts as both expand the extension of the concept of disease. They are both 
often used normatively to critique unwarranted or contested expansion of 
medicine and to address health services that are considered to be unnecessary, 
futile, or even harmful. However, there are important differences between the 
concepts, as not all cases of overdiagnosis are medicalizations and not all 
cases of medicalizations are overdiagnosis. The objective of this article is to 
clarify the differences between medicalization and overdiagnosis. It will 
demonstrate how the subject matter of medicalization traditionally has been 
non-medical (social or cultural everyday life) phenomena, while the subject 
matter of overdiagnosis has been biological or biomolecular conditions or 
processes acknowledged being potentially harmful. They also refer to different 
types of uncertainty: medicalization is concerned with indeterminacy, while 
overdiagnosis is concerned with lack of prognostic knowledge. Medicalization is 
dealing with sickness (sick role) while overdiagnosis with disease. Despite 
these differences, medicalization and overdiagnosis are becoming more alike. 
Medicalization is expanding, encompassing the more "technical" aspects of 
overdiagnosis, while overdiagnosis is becoming more ideologized. Moreover, with 
new trends in modern medicine, such as P4 (preventive, predictive, personal, and 
participatory) medicine, medicalization will become all-encompassing, while 
overdiagnosis more or less may dissolve. In the end they may converge in some 
total "iatrogenization." In doing so, the concepts may lose their precision and 
critical sting.
