BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The cost-utility of safety interventions is becoming 
increasingly important as a driver of implementation decisions. The aim of this 
study was to compare the cost-utility of different blood screening strategies in 
various settings, and to analyse the extent and cause of differences in health 
economic results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For eight Western countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, 
Finland, France, The Netherlands, UK and the United States of America), data 
were collected on donor and recipient populations, blood products, screening 
tests, and on patient treatment practices and costs. An existing ISBT web-tool 
model was used to assess the cost-utility of various strategies for HIV, HCV and 
HBV screening.
RESULTS: The cost-utility ratio of serology screening for these eight countries 
ranges between -11 000 and 92 000 US$ per QALY, and for NAT between -12 000 and 
113 000 US$ per QALY when compared to no screening. Combined serology and NAT 
ranges between 600 and 217 000 US$ per QALY. The incremental cost-utility of NAT 
after implementation of serology screening ranges from 2 231 000 to 15 778 000 
US$ per QALY.
CONCLUSION: There are substantial differences in costs per QALY between 
countries for various HIV, HBV and HCV screening strategies. These differences 
are primarily caused by costs of screening tests and infection rates in the 
donor population. Within each country, similar cost per QALY results for 
serology and NAT compared to no screening, coupled with evidence of limited 
value of serology and NAT together prompts the need for further discussion on 
the acceptability of parallel testing by serology and NAT.

OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance with biannual ultrasound 
is currently recommended for all patients with cirrhosis. However, clinical 
implementation of this "one-size-fits-all" approach is challenging as evidenced 
by its low application rate. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies in patients with cirrhosis.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic modeling was performed to simulate a cohort 
of 50-year-old subjects with compensated cirrhosis. Risk-stratified HCC 
surveillance strategies was implemented, in which patients were stratified into 
high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups by HCC risk biomarker-based scores and 
assigned to surveillance modalities tailored to HCC risk (2 non-risk-stratified 
and 14 risk-stratified strategies) and compared with non-stratified biannual 
ultrasound.
RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life expectancy gains for biannual ultrasound in all 
patients and risk-stratified strategies compared with no surveillance were 1.3 
and 0.9-2.1 years, respectively. Compared with the current standard of biannual 
ultrasound in all cirrhosis patients, risk-stratified strategies applying 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasound only in high- and 
intermediate-risk patients, without screening in low-risk patients, were 
cost-effective. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) for high- and intermediate-risk patients 
had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2,100 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained. AMRI in intermediate- and high-risk patients 
had ICERs <$3,000 across a wide range of HCC incidences.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-stratified HCC surveillance strategies targeting high- and 
intermediate-risk patients with cirrhosis are cost-effective and outperform the 
currently recommended non-stratified biannual ultrasound in all patients with 
cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial, consolidation 
treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) decreased the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL) progression after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, the 
impact of BV consolidation on overall survival, quality of life, and health care 
costs remain unclear.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to measure the costs 
and clinical outcomes for BV consolidation therapy compared with active 
surveillance in a cohort of patients aged 33 years who were at risk for HL 
relapse after ASCT. Life-time costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each post-ASCT 
strategy.
RESULTS: After quality-of-life adjustments and standard discounting, upfront BV 
consolidation was associated with an improvement of 1.07 QALYs compared with 
active surveillance plus BV as salvage. However, the strategy of BV 
consolidation led to significantly higher health care costs ($378,832 vs 
$219,761), resulting in an ICER for BV consolidation compared with active 
surveillance of $148,664/QALY. If indication-specific pricing was implemented, 
then the model-estimated BV price reductions of 18% to 38% for the consolidative 
setting would translate into ICERs of $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY, 
respectively. These findings were consistent on 1-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: BV as consolidation therapy under current US pricing is unlikely to 
be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. 
However, indication-specific price reductions for the consolidative setting 
could reduce ICERs to widely acceptable values. Cancer 2017. © 2017 American

BACKGROUND: Aside from cancer mortality, patients with head and neck cancer have 
increased mortality risk. Identifying patients with the greatest loss of 
cancer-independent life expectancy can guide comprehensive survivorship 
programs.
METHODS: Age-based survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Result (SEER) database for patients with head and neck cancer were censored for 
mortality from the index cancer. Life expectancy and years of life lost (YLL) 
referenced to the general population were calculated. Cox proportional 
regression models produced hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: Cancer-independent life expectancy for patients with head and neck 
cancer is 6.5 years shorter than expected. The greatest hazard and impact of 
other-cause mortality was associated with black race (HR 1.23; YLL 8.55), stage 
IV (HR 1.60; YLL 7.92), Medicaid (HR 1.55; YLL 12.9), and previous marriage (HR 
1.49; YLL 11.4).
CONCLUSION: Patients with head and neck cancer lives are foreshortened 
independent of their cancer diagnosis necessitating management of noncancer 
mortality to maximize overall survival.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among liver transplant (LT) 
recipients. With a rising burden of posttransplantation metabolic disease, 
increases in cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality may reduce life 
expectancy after LT. It is unknown if the risk of long-term major cardiovascular 
events (MCEs) differs among LT recipients with varying diabetic states. We 
performed a retrospective cohort study of LT recipients from 2003 through 2013 
to compare the incidence of MCEs among patients (1) without diabetes, (2) with 
pretransplantation diabetes, (3) with de novo transient posttransplantation 
diabetes, and (4) with de novo sustained posttransplantation diabetes. We 
analyzed 994 eligible patients (39% without diabetes, 24% with 
pretransplantation diabetes, 16% with transient posttransplantation diabetes, 
and 20% with sustained posttransplantation diabetes). Median follow-up was 54.7 
months. Overall, 12% of patients experienced a MCE. After adjustment for 
demographic and clinical variables, sustained posttransplantation diabetes was 
the only state associated with a significantly increased risk of MCEs 
(subdistribution hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.20-3.18). Patients 
with sustained posttransplantation diabetes mellitus had a 13% and 27% 
cumulative incidence of MCEs at 5 and 10 years, respectively. While 
pretransplantation diabetes has traditionally been associated with 
cardiovascular disease, the long-term risk of MCEs is greatest in LT recipients 
with sustained posttransplantation diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND: Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common 
practice but lacks a firm evidence base.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether or not augmenting symptomatic follow-up in primary 
care with two intensive methods of follow-up [monitoring of blood 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and scheduled imaging] is effective and 
cost-effective in detecting the recurrence of colorectal cancer treatable 
surgically with curative intent.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled open-label trial. Participants were randomly 
assigned to one of four groups: (1) minimum follow-up (n = 301), (2) CEA testing 
only (n = 300), (3) computerised tomography (CT) only (n = 299) or (4) CEA 
testing and CT (n = 302). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years and 
then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were 
performed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years. Those in the 
minimum and CEA testing-only arms had a single CT scan at 12-18 months. The 
groups were minimised on adjuvant chemotherapy, gender and age group (three 
strata).
SETTING: Thirty-nine NHS hospitals in England with access to high-volume 
services offering surgical treatment of metastatic recurrence.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1202 participants who had undergone curative treatment 
for Dukes' stage A to C colorectal cancer with no residual disease. Adjuvant 
treatment was completed if indicated. There was no evidence of metastatic 
disease on axial imaging and the post-operative blood CEA level was ≤ 10 µg/l.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome Surgical treatment of recurrence with 
curative intent. Secondary outcomes Time to detection of recurrence, survival 
after treatment of recurrence, overall survival and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Detection of recurrence During 5 years of scheduled follow-up, cancer 
recurrence was detected in 203 (16.9%) participants. The proportion of 
participants with recurrence surgically treated with curative intent was 6.3% 
(76/1202), with little difference according to Dukes' staging (stage A, 5.1%; 
stage B, 7.4%; stage C, 5.6%; p = 0.56). The proportion was two to three times 
higher in each of the three more intensive arms (7.5% overall) than in the 
minimum follow-up arm (2.7%) (difference 4.8%; p = 0.003). Surgical treatment of 
recurrence with curative intent was 2.7% (8/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 
6.3% (19/300) in the CEA testing group, 9.4% (28/299) in the CT group and 7.0% 
(21/302) in the CEA testing and CT group. Surgical treatment of recurrence with 
curative intent was two to three times higher in each of the three more 
intensive follow-up groups than in the minimum follow-up group; adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) compared with minimum follow-up were as follows: CEA testing group, 
OR 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 5.65; CT group, OR 3.69, 95% CI 
1.63 to 8.38; and CEA testing and CT group, OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.19 to 6.49. 
Survival A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed no significant difference 
between arms (log-rank p = 0.45). The baseline-adjusted Cox proportional hazards 
ratio comparing the minimum and intensive arms was 0.87 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.15). 
These CIs suggest a maximum survival benefit from intensive follow-up of 3.8%. 
Cost-effectiveness The incremental cost per patient treated surgically with 
curative intent compared with minimum follow-up was £40,131 with CEA testing, 
£43,392 with CT and £85,151 with CEA testing and CT. The lack of differential 
impact on survival resulted in little difference in QALYs saved between arms. 
The additional cost per QALY gained of moving from minimum follow-up to CEA 
testing was £25,951 and for CT was £246,107. When compared with minimum 
follow-up, combined CEA testing and CT was more costly and generated fewer 
QALYs, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (-£208,347) 
and a dominated policy.
LIMITATIONS: Although this is the largest trial undertaken at the time of 
writing, it has insufficient power to assess whether or not the improvement in 
detecting treatable recurrence achieved by intensive follow-up leads to a 
reduction in overall mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous staging to detect residual disease is important before 
embarking on follow-up. The benefit of intensive follow-up in detecting 
surgically treatable recurrence is independent of stage. The survival benefit 
from intensive follow-up is unlikely to exceed 4% in absolute terms and harm 
cannot be absolutely excluded. A longer time horizon is required to ascertain 
whether or not intensive follow-up is an efficient use of scarce health-care 
resources. Translational analyses are under way, utilising tumour tissue 
collected from Follow-up After Colorectal Surgery trial participants, with the 
aim of identifying potentially prognostic biomarkers that may guide follow-up in 
the future.

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common female cancers in the world, with 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC the most frequent subtype. Tamoxifen (Tam) is 
an effective drug that competitively binds to the ER and is routinely used for 
the treatment of ER-positive BC. However, a number of ER-positive BC do not 
respond to Tam treatment and acquired resistance is often observed, constituting 
a major challenge for extending patient life expectancy. The mechanisms 
responsible for these treatment failures remain unclear, indicating the 
requirement for other targets and better predictors for patient response to Tam. 
One of Tam's off-targets of interest is the microsomal antiestrogen binding site 
(AEBS), a multiproteic complex made up of the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase 
(ChEH) enzymes that are involved in the late stages of cholesterol biosynthesis. 
Tam and other selective ER modulators stimulate oxidative stress and inhibit the 
ChEH subunits at pharmacological doses, triggering the production and 
accumulation of cholesterol-5,6-epoxide metabolites responsible for BC cell 
differentiation and death. However, inhibition of the cholesterogenic activity 
of the AEBS subunits also induces the accumulation of sterol precursors, which 
triggers a survival autophagy to impair Tam's efficacy. Altogether, these 
studies have highlighted the involvement of cholesterol metabolism in the 
pharmacology of Tam that has provided new clues on how to improve its 
therapeutic efficacy in both BC and other cancers as well as offering a new 
rationale for developing more efficient drugs for BC treatment.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the UK. 
Presenting symptoms that can be associated with CRC usually have another 
explanation. Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) detect blood that is not visible 
to the naked eye and may help to select patients who are likely to benefit from 
further investigation.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of FITs [OC-Sensor (Eiken Chemical 
Co./MAST Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), HM-JACKarc (Kyowa Medex/Alpha Laboratories 
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), FOB Gold (Sentinel/Sysmex, Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, 
Italy), RIDASCREEN Hb or RIDASCREEN Hb/Hp complex (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, 
Germany)] for primary care triage of people with low-risk symptoms.
METHODS: Twenty-four resources were searched to March 2016. Review methods 
followed published guidelines. Summary estimates were calculated using a 
bivariate model or a random-effects logistic regression model. The 
cost-effectiveness analysis considered long-term costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) that were associated with different faecal occult blood tests 
and direct colonoscopy referral. Modelling comprised a diagnostic decision 
model, a Markov model for long-term costs and QALYs that were associated with 
CRC treatment and progression, and a Markov model for QALYs that were associated 
with no CRC.
RESULTS: We included 10 studies. Using a single sample and 10 µg Hb/g faeces 
threshold, sensitivity estimates for OC-Sensor [92.1%, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 86.9% to 95.3%] and HM-JACKarc (100%, 95% CI 71.5% to 100%) indicated that 
both may be useful to rule out CRC. Specificity estimates were 85.8% (95% CI 
78.3% to 91.0%) and 76.6% (95% CI 72.6% to 80.3%). Triage using FITs could rule 
out CRC and avoid colonoscopy in approximately 75% of symptomatic patients. Data 
from our systematic review suggest that 22.5-93% of patients with a positive FIT 
and no CRC have other significant bowel pathologies. The results of the 
base-case analysis suggested minimal difference in QALYs between all of the 
strategies; no triage (referral straight to colonoscopy) is the most expensive. 
Faecal immunochemical testing was cost-effective (cheaper and more, or only 
slightly less, effective) compared with no triage. Faecal immunochemical testing 
was more effective and costly than guaiac faecal occult blood testing, but 
remained cost-effective at a threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£30,000. The results of scenario analyses did not differ substantively from the 
base-case. Results were better for faecal immunochemical testing when accuracy 
of the guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) was based on studies that were 
more representative of the correct population.
LIMITATIONS: Only one included study evaluated faecal immunochemical testing in 
primary care; however, all of the other studies evaluated faecal immunochemical 
testing at the point of referral. Further, validation data for the Faecal 
haemoglobin, Age and Sex Test (FAST) score, which includes faecal immunochemical 
testing, showed no significant difference in performance between primary and 
secondary care. There were insufficient data to adequately assess FOB Gold, 
RIDASCREEN Hb or RIDASCREEN Hb/Hp complex. No study compared FIT assays, or FIT 
assays versus gFOBT; all of the data included in this assessment refer to the 
clinical effectiveness of individual FIT methods and not their comparative 
effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Faecal immunochemical testing is likely to be a clinically 
effective and cost-effective strategy for triaging people who are presenting, in 
primary care settings, with lower abdominal symptoms and who are at low risk for 
CRC. Further research is required to confirm the effectiveness of faecal 
immunochemical testing in primary care practice and to compare the performance 
of different FIT assays.

Orbital extension is a major cause of death in children with retinoblastoma in 
the developing countries. Delayed detection and inappropriate management 
contribute to poor outcome. Conventional treatment including primary orbital 
exenteration or chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone result in mortality as high 
as 70%. The recent understanding on the role of sequential multimodal therapy 
with a combination of high-dose chemotherapy, followed by appropriate surgery, 
radiotherapy, and additional adjuvant chemotherapy has helped dramatically 
improve life salvage.

BACKGROUND: Ulcers of the foot in people with diabetes mellitus are slow to heal 
and result in considerable cost and patient suffering. The prognosis is worst 
for ulcers of the heel.
OBJECTIVE: To assess both the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness 
of lightweight fibreglass casts in the management of heel ulcers.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, parallel, observer-blinded randomised 
controlled trial. A central randomisation centre used a computer-generated 
random number sequence to allocate participants to groups.
SETTING: Thirty-five specialist diabetic foot secondary care centres in the UK. 
Those recruited were aged ≥ 18 years and had diabetes mellitus complicated by 
ulcers of the heel of grades 2-4 on the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel 
and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel scale.
PARTICIPANTS: In total, 509 participants [68% male, 15% with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, mean age 67.5 years (standard deviation 12.4 years)] were randomised 
1 : 1 to the intervention (n = 256) or the control (n = 253) arm. The primary 
outcome data were available for 425 participants (212 from the intervention arm 
and 213 from the control arm) and exceeded the total required; attrition was 
16.5%. The median ulcer area at baseline was 275 mm2 [interquartile range (IQR) 
104-683 mm2] in the intervention group and 206 mm2 (IQR 77-649 mm2) in the 
control group. There were no differences between the two groups at baseline in 
any parameter, neither in relation to the participant nor in relation to their 
ulcer.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received usual care supplemented by the 
addition of an individually moulded, lightweight, fibreglass heel cast. The 
control group received usual care alone. The intervention phase continued either 
until the participant's ulcer had healed (maintained for 28 days) or for 24 
weeks, whichever occurred first. During this intervention phase, the 
participants were reviewed every 2 weeks, and the fibreglass casts were replaced 
when they were no longer usable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was ulcer healing (confirmed 
by a blinded observer and maintained for 4 weeks) within 24 weeks. Other outcome 
measures included the time taken for the ulcer to heal, the percentage reduction 
in the cross-sectional area, the reduction in local pain, amputation, survival 
and health economic analysis. The study was powered to define a difference in 
healing of 15% (55% intervention vs. 40% control).
RESULTS: Forty-four per cent (n = 94) of the intervention group healed within 24 
weeks, compared with 37% (n = 80) of the control participants (odds ratio 1.42, 
95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.14; p = 0.088), using an intention-to-treat 
analysis. No differences were observed between the two groups for any secondary 
outcome.
LIMITATIONS: Although the component items of care were standardised, because 
this was a pragmatic trial, usual care was not uniform. There was some evidence 
of a small excess of adverse events in the intervention group; however, 
non-blinded observers documented these events. There was no excess of adverse 
device effects.
CONCLUSIONS: There may be a small increase in healing with the use of a heel 
cast, but the estimate was not sufficiently precise to provide strong evidence 
of an effect. There was no evidence of any subgroup in which the intervention 
appeared to be particularly effective. A health economic analysis suggested that 
it is unlikely that the intervention represents good value for money. The 
provision of a lightweight heel cast may be of benefit to some individuals, but 
we have found no evidence to justify the routine adoption of this in clinical 
practice.
FUTURE WORK: It is unlikely that further study of this intervention will have an 
impact on usual clinical care, and so future efforts should be directed towards 
other interventions designed to improve the healing of ulcers in this 
population.

Le cancer chez les déficients intellectuels: épidémiologie et prise en charge.

[Article in French]

Rouëssé J.

In France, people with intellectual disability (ID) account approximately for 
2.5 % of the total population. Life expectancy of ID increased over the last 
years, and this raised the risk of cancers developing in this group of patients. 
Overall, the prevalence of cancers for those patients is much like that of the 
general population, but they have specificities regarding their epidemiology, 
diagnostic and treatment. The type of cancers occurring differs depending on the 
age and the etiology of the ID of the patient. ID may raise special difficulties 
for the management and the treatment of the cancer that may be, ultimately, non 
optimal.

BACKGROUND: Previous work shows that young athletes after anterior cruciate 
ligament reconstruction (ACLR) demonstrate single-leg (SL) landing movement 
asymmetries at the time of return to sport (RTS); however, the effect of 
movement asymmetries on longitudinal knee-related function after ACLR has not 
been examined. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the 
effect of SL drop-landing movement symmetry at the time of RTS on knee-related 
function 2 years later in young athletes after ACLR. The first hypothesis was 
that young athletes who demonstrated SL drop-landing asymmetries at RTS would 
demonstrate decreased knee function 2 years later compared with those who 
demonstrated symmetric SL drop-landing mechanics. The second hypothesis was that 
SL drop-landing movement symmetry at RTS would be associated with knee 
functional recovery 2 years later.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: This study included 48 young athletes who had undergone ACLR and were 
assessed at the time of RTS (77% female; mean [±SD] age at RTS, 17.6 ± 2.6 
years) and followed for 2 years after RTS. Three sagittal-plane landing 
variables of interest were calculated using 3-dimensional motion analysis during 
an SL drop-landing task at the time of RTS: knee flexion excursion, peak 
internal knee extension moment, and peak trunk flexion. The limb symmetry index 
(LSI) was calculated for each landing variable using the following: LSI = 
(involved/uninvolved) × 100%. The LSI was used to divide the cohort into 
symmetric (SYM) and asymmetric (ASYM) groups for each landing variable: knee 
flexion excursion (SYM: LSI ≥ 90% [n = 23]; ASYM: LSI < 85% [n = 18]), peak 
internal knee extension moment (SYM: LSI ≥ 90% [n = 19]; ASYM: LSI < 85% [n = 
22]), and peak trunk flexion (SYM: LSI ≤ 105% [n = 25]; ASYM: LSI > 115% [n = 
19]). At 2 years after RTS, knee-related function was evaluated using the Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation 
Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form, and performance on SL hop tests. 
Functional recovery was defined based on literature cutoffs for knee-related 
functional measures. Differences in 2-year function were compared between the 
symmetry groups using Mann-Whitney U tests because of nonnormality. Logistic 
regression was used to determine if landing symmetry at the time of RTS would be 
associated with 2-year knee functional recovery after RTS.
RESULTS: The ASYM knee flexion excursion group demonstrated decreased function 
at 2 years after RTS compared with the SYM group on the KOOS-Pain (ASYM: 93.0 ± 
8.2; SYM: 98.4 ± 3.0; P = .008) and the KOOS-Quality of Life (ASYM: 81.6 ± 16.1; 
SYM: 94.1 ± 9.7; P = .008). Knee flexion excursion was associated with knee 
functional recovery on the KOOS-Pain and the KOOS-Quality of Life ( P = .033 and 
P = .012, respectively) at 2 years after RTS, after controlling for the 
quadriceps strength LSI and graft type.
CONCLUSION: Young athletes after ACLR with asymmetries in knee kinematics at the 
time of RTS reported decreased self-reported function 2 years later; however, 
the clinical importance of these differences needs to be further understood.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have analysed the long-term effects of biological 
treatment in psoriasis. PsoReg, the Swedish national register for systemic 
psoriasis treatment, started in 2006 and now includes 10 years of real-world 
data on the effectiveness of biological treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the long-term real-world outcome data of patients who are 
biologically naïve with moderate-to-severe psoriasis after switching to 
biological treatment.
METHODS: An observational study of patients who are biologically naïve with at 
least one registration of outcome before switching to biological treatment while 
included in PsoReg and at least one follow-up visit. Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) 
values were analysed at 3-5 months, 6-11 months and at least once after ≥ 1 
year, up to 9 years after the switch to biological treatment.
RESULTS: In total, 583 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 399, 
395 and 373 patients had observed outcome data beyond 1 year on the PASI, DLQI 
and EQ-5D, respectively, and 164, 168 and 152, respectively, were observed in at 
least three time periods after the switch. Significant (P < 0·01) improvement in 
PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D scores was observed 3-5 months after the switch and 
sustained under the whole observation period. The mean PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D 
changed from 13·5 ± 9·1, 9·0 ± 8·1 and 0·74 ± 0·22, respectively, before the 
switch, to 4·0 ± 3·5, 3·7 ± 4·7 and 0·79 ± 0·21, respectively, 1-5 years after 
the switch.
CONCLUSIONS: Biological treatment, as used in clinical practice, shows a stable 
long-term effectiveness in all the measured dimensions, PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D.

A paradigm shift for socioeconomic justice and health: from focusing on 
inequalities to aiming at sustainable equity.

OBJECTIVES: To measure the 'best possible health for all', incorporating 
sustainability, and to establish the magnitude of global health inequity.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational, retrospective.
METHODS: We identified countries with three criteria: (1) a healthy 
population-life expectancy above world average; (2) living conditions feasible 
to replicate worldwide-per-capita gross domestic product (GDP-pc) below the 
world average; and (3) sustainability-per-capita carbon dioxide emissions lower 
than the planetary pollution boundary. Using these healthy, feasible, and 
sustainable (HFS) countries as the gold standard, we estimated the burden of 
global health inequity (BGHiE) in terms of excess deaths, analyzing time-trends 
(1950-2012) by age, sex, and geographic location. Finally, we defined a global 
income 'equity zone' and quantified the economic gap needed to achieve global 
sustainable health equity.
RESULTS: A total of 14 countries worldwide met the HFS criteria. Since 1970, 
there has been a BGHiE of ∼17 million avoidable deaths per year (∼40% of all 
deaths), with 36 life-years-lost per excess death. Young children and women bore 
a higher BGHiE, and, in recent years, the highest proportion of avoidable deaths 
occurred in Africa, India, and the Russian Federation. By 2012, the most 
efficient HFS countries had a GDP-pc/year of USD$2,165, which we proposed as the 
lower equity zone threshold. The estimated USD$2.58 trillion economic gap 
represents 3.6% of the world's GDP-twenty times larger than current total global 
foreign aid.
CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable health equity metrics provide a benchmark tool to guide 
efforts toward transforming overall living conditions, as a means to achieve the 
'best possible health for all.'

BACKGROUND: Malignant glioma (MG) is a devastating neuro-oncologic disease with 
almost invariably poor prognosis. Prognostic awareness (PA) is the awareness of 
incurable disease and shortened life expectancy (LE). Accurate PA is associated 
with favorable psychological outcomes at the end of life (EoL) for patients with 
cancer; however, little is known about PA or prognostic communication in MG. 
Moreover, research has yet to evaluate the impact of cognitive impairment on PA 
and preferred forms of communication.
METHODS: Fifty MG patients and 32 paired caregivers were evaluated in this 
exploratory study with a semi-structured PA assessment aimed to measure their 
awareness of MG incurability and LE. Full PA was defined as awareness of MG 
incurability and accurate estimate of LE. The assessment included a survey about 
preferences for prognostic communication (items from the Prognosis and Treatment 
Perceptions Questionnaire), neurocognitive assessment (Hopkins Verbal Learning 
Test-Revised, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, and the Controlled Oral Word 
Association Test), and measurements of mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain 
[FACT-Br]).
RESULTS: Twenty (40%) patients and 22 (69%) caregivers had full PA. Thirty (60%) 
patients and 23 (72%) caregivers reported that prognostic information was 
extremely or very important, and 21 (42%) patients and 16 (50%) caregivers 
desired more prognostic information. Patients with memory impairment more 
frequently believed that prognostic information was important (P = 0.04, P = 
0.03) and desired more information (P = 0.05, P = 0.003) as compared with those 
without impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Most MG patients were unaware of their LE. Memory impairment may 
influence preferences for prognostic information.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic laparoscopy prior 
to primary cytoreductive surgery to prevent futile primary cytoreductive surgery 
(i.e. leaving >1cm residual disease) in patients suspected of advanced stage 
ovarian cancer.
METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled 
trial in which patients suspected of advanced stage ovarian cancer who qualified 
for primary cytoreductive surgery were randomized to either laparoscopy or 
primary cytoreductive surgery. Direct medical costs from a health care 
perspective over a 6-month time horizon were analyzed. Health outcomes were 
expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and utility was based on 
patient's response to the EQ-5D questionnaires. We primarily focused on direct 
medical costs based on Dutch standard prices.
RESULTS: We studied 201 patients, of whom 102 were randomized to laparoscopy and 
99 to primary cytoreductive surgery. No significant difference in QALYs 
(utility=0.01; 95% CI 0.006 to 0.02) was observed. Laparoscopy reduced the 
number of futile laparotomies from 39% to 10%, while its costs were € 1400 per 
intervention, making the overall costs of both strategies comparable (difference 
€ -80 per patient (95% CI -470 to 300)). Findings were consistent across various 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected advanced stage ovarian cancer, a 
diagnostic laparoscopy reduced the number of futile laparotomies, without 
increasing total direct medical health care costs, or adversely affecting 
complications or quality of life.

HpNetrin and its receptor neogenin during early development in the sea urchin 
(Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus).

Netrins, chemotropic guidance cues, can guide the extension of serotonergic 
axons by binding to netrin receptors during neural development. However, little 
is known about whether disruption of netrin signaling is involved in the 
mechanisms by which organophosphorus pesticides affect serotonergic nervous 
system (SNS) development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the 
pesticide monocrotophos (MCP) on the expression patterns of HpNetrin and its 
receptor neogenin as well as on the intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels in 
Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus (sea urchin) by exposing fertilized embryos to 0, 
0.01, 0.10, and 1.00mg/L MCP. The results showed that MCP disrupted HpNetrin and 
neogenin expression at different developmental stages in H. pulcherrimus and 
that Ca2+ appeared to be involved in the MCP-induced developmental 
neurotoxicity. Specifically, the lower concentrations of MCP elevated HpNetrin 
and neogenin transcription, resulting in higher intracellular Ca2+ levels during 
the early developmental stages in the sea urchin; this may affect 
netrin-directed cell migration/axon extension and subsequently disrupt 
serotonergic axon branching and synapse formation. In contrast, 1.00mg/L MCP 
exhibited an inhibitory effect on HpNetrin and neogenin transcription. This 
finding implies that the regulatory roles of these factors may be diminished 
during early development, thereby causing developmental defects in the sea 
urchin. Collectively, our results provide a basis for exploring the involvement 
of netrin and neogenin in the organophosphate-induced disruption of the SNS 
during development.
