showed 20 years ago that the extent of childhood stressors correlates with the 
occurrence of various somatic, functional and psychological diseases in 
adulthood and that cumulative stressors are also reflected in a significantly 
reduced average life expectancy. The altered stress-related endocrine system is 
of major importance with regard to the pathogenesis of the secondary somatic, 
functional and psychological disorders mentioned above.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Kindliche Stresserfahrungen durch Vernachlässigung, 
körperliche, psychische oder sexuelle Misshandlung führen oftmals zu dauerhaften 
Veränderungen der stressregulatorischen neuroendokrinen Prozessabläufe. 
Epidemiologische Untersuchungen zeigten bereits vor 20 Jahren, dass das Ausmass 
der kindlichen Stressoren mit dem Auftreten von diversen somatischen, 
funktionellen und psychischen Erkrankungen im Erwachsenenalter korreliert und 
sich kumulierte Stressoren auch in einer deutlich erniedrigten 
durchschnittlichen Lebenserwartung widerspiegeln. Dem veränderten 
stressendokrinen System kommt eine massgebliche Bedeutung hinsichtlich 
Pathogenese der erwähnten somatischen, funktionellen und psychischen 
Folgestörungen zu.

The neuronal basis of complex social behavior is still poorly understood. In 
honeybees, reproductive investment decisions are made at the colony-level. 
Queens develop from female-destined larvae that receive alloparental care from 
nurse bees in the form of ad-libitum royal jelly (RJ) secretions. Typically, the 
number of raised new queens is limited but genetic breeding of "royal jelly 
bees" (RJBs) for enhanced RJ production over decades has led to a dramatic 
increase of reproductive investment in queens. Here, we compare RJBs to 
unselected Italian bees (ITBs) to investigate how their cognitive processing of 
larval signals in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and antennal lobes (ALs) may 
contribute to their behavioral differences. A cross-fostering experiment 
confirms that the RJB syndrome is mainly due to a shift in nurse bee 
alloparental care behavior. Using olfactory conditioning of the proboscis 
extension reflex, we show that the RJB nurses spontaneously respond more often 
to larval odors compared with ITB nurses but their subsequent learning occurs at 
similar rates. These phenotypic findings are corroborated by our demonstration 
that the proteome of the brain, particularly of the ALs differs between RJBs and 
ITBs. Notably, in the ALs of RJB newly emerged bees and nurses compared with 
ITBs, processes of energy and nutrient metabolism, signal transduction are 
up-regulated, priming the ALs for receiving and processing the brood signals 
from the antennae. Moreover, highly abundant major royal jelly proteins and 
hexamerins in RJBs compared with ITBs during early life when the nervous system 
still develops suggest crucial new neurobiological roles for these 
well-characterized proteins. Altogether, our findings reveal that RJBs have 
evolved a strong olfactory response to larvae, enabled by numerous 
neurophysiological adaptations that increase the nurse bees' alloparental care 
behavior.

Therapeutic fragmented antibodies show a poor pharmacokinetic profile that leads 
to frequent high-dose administration. In the current study, for the first time, 
a novel proline, alanine, serine (PAS) repeat sequence called PAS#208 was 
designed to extend the plasma half-life of a nanosized anti-vascular endothelial 
growth factor-A single-domain antibody. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and electrophoretic light 
scattering were used to assess the physicochemical properties of the newly 
designed PAS sequence. The effect of PAS#208 on the biologic activity of a 
single-domain antibody was studied using an in vitro proliferation assay. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters, including terminal half-life, the volume of 
distribution, elimination rate constant, and clearance, were determined in mice 
model and compared with the native protein and PAS#1(200) sequence. The novel 
PAS repeat sequence showed comparable physicochemical, biologic, and 
pharmacokinetic features to the previously reported PAS#1(200) sequence. The 
PAS#208 increased the hydrodynamic radius and decreased significantly the 
electrophoretic mobility of the native protein without any change in zeta 
potential. Surprisingly, the fusion of PAS#208 to the single-domain antibody 
increased the binding potency. In addition, it did not alter the biologic 
activity and did not show any cytotoxicity on the normal cells. The PAS#208 
sequence improved the terminal half-life (14-fold) as well as other 
pharmacokinetic parameters significantly. The simplicity as well as superior 
effects on half-life extension make PAS#208 sequence a novel sequence for in 
vivo pharmacokinetic enhancement of therapeutic fragmented antibodies. 
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the current study, a new proline, alanine, serine 
(PAS) sequence was developed that showed comparable physicochemical, biological, 
and pharmacokinetic features to the previously reported PAS#1(200) sequence. The 
simplicity as well as superior effects on half-life extension make PAS#208 
sequence a novel sequence for in vivo pharmacokinetic enhancement of recombinant 
small proteins.

OBJECTIVE: Several diabetes clinical practice guidelines suggest that treatment 
goals may be modified in older adults on the basis of comorbidities, 
complications, and life expectancy. The long-term benefits of treatment 
intensification may not outweigh short-term risks for patients with limited life 
expectancy. Because of the uncertainty of determining life expectancy for 
individual patients, we sought to develop and validate prognostic indices for 
mortality in older adults with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a prevalence sample of veterans with 
diabetes who were aged ≥65 years on 1 January 2006 (N = 275,190). Administrative 
data were queried for potential predictors that included patient demographics, 
comorbidities, procedure codes, laboratory values and anthropomorphic 
measurements, medication history, and previous health service utilization. 
Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regressions were used 
to identify variables independently associated with mortality. The resulting 
odds ratios were then weighted to create prognostic indices of mortality over 5 
and 10 years.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven predictors of mortality were identified: 4 demographic 
variables, prescriptions for insulin or sulfonylureas or blood pressure 
medications, 6 biomarkers, previous outpatient and inpatient utilization, and 22 
comorbidities/procedures. The prognostic indices showed good discrimination, 
with C-statistics of 0.74 and 0.76 for 5- and 10-year mortality, respectively. 
The indices also demonstrated excellent agreement between observed outcome and 
predictions, with calibration slopes of 1.01 for both 5- and 10-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic indices obtained from administrative data can predict 5- 
and 10-year mortality in older adults with diabetes. Such a tool may enable 
clinicians and patients to develop individualized treatment goals that balance 
risks and benefits of treatment intensification.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based expression systems, which rely on safe, 
food-grade strains, are low cost, simple to operate, and can be used for 
large-scale fermentation. However, low levels of foreign protein expression by 
S. cerevisiae have limited their widespread application. The ability of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to fold and process foreign proteins is an important 
factor restricting the expression of foreign proteins. In the current study, the 
effects of transcription factor Hac1p, which is involved in the unfolded protein 
response pathway, on S. cerevisiae-based expression of xylanase gene xynB from 
Aspergillus niger were examined. Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), rDNA integration and droplet digital PCR technology were used to generate 
a S. cerevisiae strain (S8) containing eight copies of xynB, allowing high-yield 
secretory expression of xylanase. The effects of subsequent overexpression of 
HAC1 in strain S8 on the expression of genes associated with protein folding in 
the ER were then examined using the GeXP system. Results confirmed the 
constitutive secretory expression of the multiple copies of xynB following 
rDNA-based integration of the expression cassette, with a maximum xylanase yield 
of 325 U/mL. However, overexpression of HAC1 further improved xylanase 
production by strain S8, resulting in a yield of 381 U/mL.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments for localised prostate cancer.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of active monitoring, surgery, and radiotherapy 
was evaluated within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) 
randomised controlled trial from a UK NHS perspective at 10 years' median 
follow-up. Prostate cancer resource-use collected from hospital records and 
trial participants was valued using UK reference-costs. QALYs 
(quality-adjusted-life-years) were calculated from patient-reported EQ-5D-3L 
measurements. Adjusted mean costs, QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were calculated; cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity 
analyses addressed uncertainty; subgroup analyses considered age and 
disease-risk.
RESULTS: Adjusted mean QALYs were similar between groups: 6.89 (active 
monitoring), 7.09 (radiotherapy), and 6.91 (surgery). Active monitoring had 
lower adjusted mean costs (£5913) than radiotherapy (£7361) and surgery (£7519). 
Radiotherapy was the most likely (58% probability) cost-effective option at the 
UK NICE willingness-to-pay threshold (£20,000 per QALY). Subgroup analyses 
confirmed radiotherapy was cost-effective for older men and 
intermediate/high-risk disease groups; active monitoring was more likely to be 
the cost-effective option for younger men and low-risk groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer follow-up and modelling are required to determine the most 
cost-effective treatment for localised prostate cancer over a man's lifetime.

The worldwide increase in life expectancy is leading to an increase in 
age-dependent diseases, including nonfamilial, sporadic Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which is the subject of this review. The etiology and pathophysiology of 
the disease is not fully understood, but present observations suggest that, in 
addition to genetic risk factors, environmental influences may be involved via 
epigenetic mechanisms. Currently, there is no effective treatment, but there are 
indications that lifestyle has an impact on the development of the disease. This 
view is supported by preclinical studies not only showing that human 
lifestyle-equivalent interventions have a positive effect on cognitive function 
in animal models of AD, but also indicating the involvement of underlying 
epigenetic mechanisms. After a brief overview of the most characteristic 
chromatin modifications, ie, DNA methylation and histone modifications, 
epigenetic changes associated with aging are considered, given that aging is the 
most important risk factor for AD. This is followed by a description of some 
epigenetic alterations recognized in AD. The impact of environmental factors and 
lifestyle on the epigenome is then considered. Epigenetic treatments with HDAC 
inhibitors and RNA-based drugs are considered, which - while still in 
preclinical stages - are promising for potential benefit. It is concluded that 
while awaiting results from clinical trials in progress, focusing on lifestyle 
adjustments with an epigenetic background are the best way to prevent/delay the 
onset of this devastating disease.

Improving marketability and extension of vase life of cut flowers has practical 
significance for the development of the cut flower industry. Although 
considerable efforts have been made over many years to improve the vase life of 
cut flowers through controlling the immediate environment and through 
post-harvest use of floral preservatives, the impact of lighting environment on 
vase life has been largely overlooked. In the current study, the effect of three 
LED light spectra [white (400-730 nm), blue (peak at 460 nm), and red (peak at 
660 nm)] at 150 μmol m-2 s-1 on vase life and on physiological and biochemical 
characteristics of carnation cut flowers was investigated. Exposure to blue 
light (BL) considerably delayed senescence and improved vase life over that of 
flowers exposed to red light (RL) and white light (WL). H2O2 and malondialdehyde 
(MDA) contents in petals gradually increased during vase life; the increase was 
lowest in BL-exposed flowers. As a consequence, BL-exposed flowers maintained a 
higher membrane stability index (MSI) compared to RL- and WL-exposed flowers. A 
higher activity of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase 
(POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)] was detected in petals of 
BL-exposed flowers, compared to their activities in RL- and WL-exposed flowers. 
In BL-exposed flowers, the decline in petal carotenoid contents was delayed in 
comparison to RL- and WL-exposed flowers. Maximum quantum efficiency of 
photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and a higher percentage of open stomata were observed in 
leaves of BL-exposed flowers. Sucrose and glucose contents accumulated in petals 
during vase life; sugar concentrations were higher in BL-exposed flowers than in 
RL- and WL-exposed flowers. It is concluded that BL exposure improves the vase 
life of carnation cut flowers through its effect on the antioxidant defense 
system in petals and on photosynthetic performance in the leaves.

BACKGROUND: In this era of expanding life expectancy and popularity of aesthetic 
breast surgeries, more women are likely to live more years with their augmented 
breasts. Thus, consistent attention to general breast health is crucial, and 
preoperative ultrasound is helpful to locate suspicious lesions. In this study, 
we present a combinative procedure of augmentation mammoplasty and 
vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB).
METHODS: From January of 2018 to December of 2019, a total of 102 patients 
received simultaneous augmentation mammoplasty and VABB in our institute. Only 
patients of primary augmentation mammoplasty who received VABB on unilateral 
breasts were included. We sought to investigate the results of each breast and 
safety of adding VABB before performing augmentation within the same incision.
RESULTS: Among 204 breasts and implants, 28.43% were done via endoscopic 
transaxillary approach and 71.57% via inframammary approach. The mean implant 
volume was 329.34 ± 44.79 ml, and the mean follow-up period was 
14.23 ± 4.64 months. All of the complication rates exhibited no statistically 
significant differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Simultaneous augmentation mammoplasty and VABB prevented unnecessary 
scars and pain, and the complication rates did not statistically differ from 
those of augmentation only group. This co-operation is a safe and simple method 
potentially beneficial to many women interested in breast surgery.

IMPORTANCE: Despite requirements of informed consent, patients with advanced 
cancer often receive palliative chemotherapy (PC) without understanding that the 
likelihood of cure is remote.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a PC educational video and booklet at treatment 
initiation could improve patients' understanding of its benefits and risks.
INTERVENTIONS: Regimen-specific PC videos and booklets presenting information 
about logistics, potential benefits, life expectancy (optional), adverse 
effects, and alternatives. Videos featured authentic patients sharing diverse 
experiences. After receiving treatment recommendations, research assistants 
distributed materials to patients for independent review.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial of 
patients with advanced colorectal or pancreatic cancer starting first-line or 
second-line PC in 5 US cancer centers with enrollment from June 2015 to 
September 2017 and follow-up to December 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was accurate expectations of 
chemotherapy benefits at 3 months, defined as responding "not at all likely" to 
"What is your understanding of how likely the chemotherapy is to cure your 
cancer?" (from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study). 
Secondary outcomes included understanding of adverse effects, decisional 
conflict (SURE test), regret (Decisional Regret Scale), and distress (Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General emotional well-being subscale).
RESULTS: Among 186 patients with advanced colorectal or pancreatic cancer who 
were starting first-line or second-line PC (94 randomized to usual care, 92 to 
intervention; mean [SD] age, 59.3 [12.6] [range, 28-86] years; 107 [58%] male; 
118 [63.4%] colorectal and 68 [36.6%] pancreatic cancer), most patients wanted 
"a lot" of information or "as much information as possible" about adverse 
effects (149, 80.1%), likelihood of cure (148, 79.6%), and prognosis (148, 
79.6%). Among the intervention arm, 59 (78%) reviewed the booklet and 30 (40%) 
reviewed the video within 2 weeks. The primary outcome did not differ between 
intervention and control arms (52.6%; 95% CI, 40.3%-65.0%; vs 55.5%; 95% CI, 
45.1%-66.0%). Accurate adverse effect understanding was more common among 
intervention than control patients (56.0%; 95% CI, 44.3%-67.7%; vs 40.2%; 95% 
CI, 29.5%-50.9%; P = .05), although this did not meet the threshold for 
statistical significance. The intervention did not increase distress, despite 
frank prognostic information. Other secondary outcomes were similar.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Provision of an educational video and booklet did not 
alter patients' expectation of cure from PC. Alternative delivery strategies, 
such as integration with nurse teaching, could be explored in future studies.

BACKGROUND: In Southern European countries, whey cheeses are normally produced 
with ovine or caprine whey. Cow's cheese whey can also be used, although the 
whey cheese yield is low (2-3%, w/v) which discourages its use. In the present 
study, bovine cheese whey was concentrated by ultrafiltration for the production 
of four types of whey cheeses (Requeijão): conventional, without any addition 
(WC); with 10% (w/w) addition of cream (WCC); with cream fermented with Kefir 
culture (WCCK); and with cream fermented with Bifidobacterium sp. culture 
(WCCBB12).
RESULTS: Whey cheeses with cream presented lower protein content (330-360 g kg-1 
, dry basis) and higher levels of total solids (220-250 g kg-1 ) and fat 
(300-330 g kg-1 , dry basis) than WC. C16:0 and C18:1 were the most abundant 
fatty acids present, with 31% and 38%, respectively. The small differences found 
concerning instrumental determination of colour and texture were not perceived 
by panelists. However, the presence of Kefir and probiotics decreased the 
elastic modulus (G') of the samples, as well as their viscosity. Fermentation 
with Kefir presented the highest counts of lactic acid bacteria (7 logUFC g-1 ). 
However, after 14 days of refrigerated storage, the counts of yeasts and moulds 
reached 6 logUFC g-1 in all products, indicating the need for appropriate 
packaging solutions.
CONCLUSION: Ultrafiltration of bovine whey allows for the efficient production 
of bovine whey cheeses. The addition of cream fermented with Kefir or BB12 
appears to be an efficient methodology to incorporate Kefir or probiotic 
bacteria in Requeijão, improving its nutritional and sensory characteristics, 
alongside the potential for the extension of its shelf-life. © 2020 Society of

Public health in the rural United States is a complex and underfunded 
enterprise. While urban-rural disparities have been a focus for researchers and 
policymakers alike for decades, inequalities continue to grow. Life expectancy 
at birth is now 1 to 2 years greater between wealthier urban and rural counties, 
and is as much as 5 years, on average, between wealthy and poor counties.This 
article explores the growth in these disparities over the past 40 years, with 
roots in structural, economic, and social spending differentials that have 
emerged or persisted over the same time period. Importantly, a focus on 
place-based disparities recognizes that the rural United States is not a 
monolith, with important geographic and cultural differences present regionally. 
We also focus on the challenges the rural governmental public health enterprise 
faces, the so-called "double disparity" of worse health outcomes and behaviors 
alongside modest investment in health departments compared with their nonrural 
peers.Finally, we offer 5 population-based "prescriptions" for supporting rural 
public health in the United States. These relate to greater investment and 
supporting rural advocacy to better address the needs of the rural United States 
in this new decade.

AIMS: To construct and compare a partitioned-survival analysis (PartSA) and a 
semi-Markov multi-state model (MSM) to investigate differences in estimated cost 
effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment from a UK perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a cohort of late-stage cancer patients 
(N > 700) enrolled within a randomized, controlled trial were used to populate 
both modelling approaches. The statistical software R was used to fit parametric 
survival models to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
data to inform the PartSA (package "flexsurv"). The package "mstate" was used to 
estimate the MSM transitions (permitted transitions: (T1) "progression-free" to 
"dead", (T2) "post-progression" to "death", and (T3) "pre-progression" to 
"post-progression"). Key costs included were treatment-related (initial, 
subsequent, and concomitant), adverse events, hospitalizations and monitoring. 
Utilities were stratified by progression. Outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per 
annum over a 15-year time horizon.
RESULTS: The PartSA and MSM approaches estimated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) of £342,474 and £411,574, respectively. Scenario analyses 
exploring alternative parametric forms provided incremental discounted life-year 
estimates that ranged from +0.15 to +0.33 for the PartSA approach, compared with 
-0.13 to +0.23 for the MSM approach. This variation was reflected in the range 
of ICERs. The PartSA produced ICERs between £234,829 and £522,963, whereas MSM 
results were more variable and included instances where the intervention was 
dominated and ICERs above £7 million (caused by very small incremental QALYs).
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Structural uncertainty in economic modelling is 
rarely explored due to time and resource limitations. This comparison of 
structural approaches indicates that the choice of structure may have a profound 
impact on cost-effectiveness results. This highlights the importance of 
carefully considered model conceptualization, and the need for further research 
to ascertain when it may be most appropriate to use each approach.

Th formation of metal base pairs is a versatile method for the introduction of 
metal cations into nucleic acids that has been used in numerous applications 
including the construction of metal nanowires, development of energy, 
charge-transfer devices and expansion of the genetic alphabet. As an 
alternative, enzymatic construction of metal base pairs is an alluring strategy 
that grants access to longer sequences and offers the possibility of using such 
unnatural base pairs (UBPs) in SELEX experiments for the identification of 
functional nucleic acids. This method remains rather underexplored, and a better 
understanding of the key parameters in the design of efficient nucleotides is 
required. We have investigated the effect of methylation of the imidazole 
nucleoside (dImnMe TP) on the efficiency of the enzymatic construction of metal 
base pairs. The presence of methyl substituents on dImTP facilitates the 
polymerase-driven formation of dIm4Me -AgI -dIm and dIm2Me TP-CrIII -dIm base 
pairs. Steric factors rather than the basicity of the imidazole nucleobase 
appear to govern the enzymatic formation of such metal base pairs. We also 
demonstrate the compatibility of other metal cations rarely considered in the 
construction of artificial metal bases by enzymatic DNA synthesis under both 
primer extension reaction and PCR conditions. These findings open up new 
directions for the design of nucleotide analogues for the development of metal 
base pairs.

End-of-life (EOL) care for terminal illness and life-limiting conditions is a 
sector in the health service spectrum that is drawing increased attention. 
Despite having the world's longest life expectancy and an ever-escalating demand 
for long-term care, Hong Kong's EOL care was underdeveloped. The current study 
aims to provide a holistic picture of gaps and issues to EOL care in Hong Kong. 
Data collection was conducted using a multi-method qualitative approach that 
included focus groups and in-depth interviews with key informants and 
stakeholders, and longitudinal case studies with patients and families. 
Deductive thematic analysis was used to examine service gaps in current EOL care 
through the lens of a socioecological model where gaps and issues in various 
nested, hierarchical levels of care as well as the relationships between these 
levels were studied in detail. Using the model, we identified gaps and issues of 
EOL care among older populations in Hong Kong at the policy, legal, community, 
institutional, as well as intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. These include 
but are not limited to a lack of overarching EOL care policy framework, 
ambiguity in the legal basis for mental incapacity, legislative barriers for 
advance directives, inadequate capacity, resources, and support in the community 
to administer EOL care, inadequate knowledge, training, and resources for EOL 
care in health and social care sectors, inadequate medical-social interface, 
general reluctance and fear of death and dying, as well as the cultural 
interpretation of filial piety that may lengthen the suffering of the dying 
patients. Findings highlight the multi-level gaps and issues of EOL care in a 
place where western and eastern culture meet, and shed light on how best to 
design more effective and comprehensive policy interventions that will likely 
have a more sustainable and instrumental impact on facilitating person-centered 
EOL care during the end of life.

muscle contraction, and not the windlass mechanism.

The rigidity of the human foot is often described as a feature of our evolution 
for upright walking and is bolstered by a thick plantar aponeurosis that 
connects the heel to the toes. Previous descriptions of human foot function 
consider stretch of the plantar aponeurosis via toe extension (windlass 
mechanism) to stiffen the foot as it is levered against the ground for push-off 
during walking. In this study, we applied controlled loading to human feet in 
vivo, and studied foot function during the push-off phase of walking, with the 
aim of carefully testing how the foot is tensioned during contact with the 
ground. Both experimental paradigms revealed that plantar aponeurosis strain via 
the 'windlass mechanism' could not explain the tensioning and stiffening of the 
foot that is observed with increased foot-ground contact forces and push-off 
effort. Instead, electromyographic recordings suggested that active contractions 
of ankle plantar flexors provide the source of tension in the plantar 
aponeurosis. Furthermore, plantar intrinsic foot muscles were also contributing 
to the developed tension along the plantar aspect of the foot. We conclude that 
active muscular contraction, not the passive windlass mechanism, is the foot's 
primary source of rigidity for push-off against the ground during bipedal 
walking.

Aging is a time-dependent inevitable process, in which cellular homeostasis is 
affected, which has an impact on tissue function. This represents a risk factor 
for the development of numerous non-transmissible diseases. In consequence, the 
scientific community continues to search for therapeutic measures capable of 
improving quality of life and delaying cellular aging. At the center of this 
research is metformin, a widely used drug in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treatment 
that has a reduced adverse effects profile. Furthermore, there is evidence that 
this drug has beneficial health effects that go beyond its anti-hyperglycemic 
properties. Among these effects, its geronto-protection capability stands out. 
There is growing evidence that points out to an increased life expectancy as 
well as the quality of life in model organisms treated with metformin. 
Therefore, there is an abundance of research centered on elucidating the 
mechanism through which metformin has its anti-aging effects. Among these, the 
AMPK, mTORC1, SIRT1, FOXO, NF.kB, and DICER1 pathways can be mentioned. 
Furthermore, studies have highlighted the possibility of a role for the gut 
microbiome in these processes. The next step is the design of clinical essays 
that have as a goal evaluating the efficacy and safety of metformin as an 
anti-aging drug in humans to create a paradigm in the medical horizon. The 
question being if metformin is, in fact, the new antiaging therapy in humans?

The Fontan procedure has improved survival and quality of life for patients with 
single ventricle physiology. Along with extended life expectancy comes a growing 
population that is experiencing long-term multiorgan adverse effects. Whereas 
cardiorenal interactions have been extensively studied in patients with a 
structurally normal heart, these are less well understood in patients with a 
single ventricle. Several studies have investigated the prevalence of reduced 
glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in the Fontan population; however, 
the long-term implication of renal dysfunction is not well established in this 
population. This paper provides a concise review of the published reports on the 
pathophysiology and spectrum of Fontan-associated renal disease. It also 
identifies gaps in currently available evidence that can guide ongoing and 
future research.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of incorporating cryoablation in the 
treatment regimens for uncomplicated bone metastases using radiation therapy 
(RT) in single-fraction RT (SFRT) or multiple-fraction RT (MFRT) regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using 1-month cycles over 
a lifetime horizon to compare the cost effectiveness of multiple strategies, 
including RT followed by RT (RT-RT) for recurrent pain, RT followed by 
cryoablation (RT-ablation), and cryoablation followed by RT (ablation-RT). RT-RT 
consisted of 8 Gy in 1 fraction/8 Gy in 1 fraction (SFRT-SFRT) and 30 Gy in 10 
fractions/20 Gy in 5 fractions (MFRT-MFRT). Probabilities and utilities were 
extracted from a search of the medical literature. Costs were calculated from a 
payer perspective using 2017 Medicare reimbursement in an outpatient setting. 
Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using strategies 
evaluated for willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). To account for model uncertainty, one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, SFRT-ablation was cost effective relative to 
SFRT-SFRT at $96,387/QALY. MFRT-ablation was cost effective relative to 
MFRT-MFRT at $85,576/QALY. Ablation-SFRT and ablation-MFRT were not cost 
effective with ICERs >$100,000/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results 
were highly sensitive to variation in multiple model parameters, including 
median survival (base: 9 months), with SFRT-SFRT favored at median survival ≤8.7 
months. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis examining SFRT-based regimens showed 
that SFRT-ablation was preferred in 36.9% of simulations at WTP of 
$100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Cryoablation is a potentially cost-effective alternative to 
reirradiation with RT for recurrent of pain following RT; however, no strategy 
incorporating initial cryoablation was cost effective.
