BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the rates of incidence, death, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of ischemic stroke in young adults aged 
15-49 years and the relevant risk factors by sex, age group, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI) in 204 countries and territories.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
(GBD) 2019 study were used. The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were 
calculated to evaluate the temporal trends from 1990 to 2019. We also estimated 
the risk factors contributing to DALYs resulting from ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the global age-standardized incidence (EAPC = 
-0.97), death (EAPC = -0.11), and DALYs rates (EAPC = -0.55) of ischemic stroke 
in young adults decreased. The largest increases in age-standardized incidence, 
death, and DALYs rates were observed in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. At 
the regional level, North Africa and the Middle East and Southeast Asia showed 
the largest increases in the age-standardized incidence, death, and DALYs rates 
of ischemic stroke. The age-standardized incidence rate was higher among young 
women than among young men in 2019. Globally, a high environmental temperature, 
high body mass index (BMI), and a high fasting plasma glucose contributed to the 
largest increases in age-standardized DALYs rates between 1990 and 2019. In the 
same period, the largest increases in the age-standardized DALYs rates in 
high-SDI and low-SDI regions were attributable to high environmental 
temperatures and alcohol use, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The burden of ischemic stroke in young adults continues to increase 
in low-SDI regions such as North Africa and the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
There were differences in the primary risk factors related to the burden of 
ischemic stroke in different SDI regions. Targeted implementation of 
cost-effective policies and interventions is an urgent need to reduce the burden 
of ischemic stroke in young adults.

Present study deals with molecular expression patterns responsible for 
post-harvest shelf-life extension of mulberry leaves. Quantitative profiling 
showed retention of primary metabolite and accumulation of stress markers in NS7 
and CO7 respectively. The leaf mRNA profiles was sequenced using the Illumina 
platform to identify DEGs. A total of 3413 DEGs were identified between the 
treatments. Annotation with Arabidopsis database has identified 1022 DEGs 
unigenes. STRING generated protein-protein interaction, identified 1013 DEGs 
nodes with p < 1.0e-16. KEGG classifier has identified genes and their 
participating biological processes. MCODE and BiNGO detected sub-networking and 
ontological enrichment, respectively at p ≤ 0.05. Genes associated with 
chloroplast architecture, photosynthesis, detoxifying ROS and RCS, and 
innate-immune response were significantly up-regulated, responsible for 
extending shelf-life in NS7. Loss of storage sucrose, enhanced activity of 
senescence-related hormones, accumulation of xenobiotics, and development of 
osmotic stress inside tissue system was the probable reason for tissue 
deterioration in CO7. qPCR validation of DEGs was in good agreement with RNA 
sequencing results, indicating the reliability of the sequencing platform. 
Present outcome provides a molecular insight regarding involvement of genes in 
self-life extension, which might help the sericulture industry to overcome their 
pre-existing problems related to landless farmers and larval feeding during 
monsoon.

We construct a polygenic health index as a weighted sum of polygenic risk scores 
for 20 major disease conditions, including, e.g., coronary artery disease, type 
1 and 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, etc. Individual weights are determined by 
population-level estimates of impact on life expectancy. We validate this index 
in odds ratios and selection experiments using unrelated individuals and 
siblings (pairs and trios) from the UK Biobank. Individuals with higher index 
scores have decreased disease risk across almost all 20 diseases (no significant 
risk increases), and longer calculated life expectancy. When estimated 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are used as the performance metric, the 
gain from selection among ten individuals (highest index score vs average) is 
found to be roughly 4 DALYs. We find no statistical evidence for antagonistic 
trade-offs in risk reduction across these diseases. Correlations between genetic 
disease risks are found to be mostly positive and generally mild. These results 
have important implications for public health and also for fundamental issues 
such as pleiotropy and genetic architecture of human disease conditions.

When evaluating vaccine efficacy, the conventional measures include reduction of 
risk of hospitalization and death. The number of patients dying with or without 
vaccination is often in the public spotlight. However, when evaluating public 
health interventions or the burden of disease, it is more illustrative to use 
mortality metrics taking into account also prematurity of the deaths, such as 
years of life lost (YLL) or years of life saved (YLS) thanks to the vaccination. 
We develop this approach for evaluation of the difference in YLL and YLS between 
COVID-19 victims with or without completed vaccination in the autumn pandemic 
wave (2021, October-December) in Czechia. For the analysis, individual data 
about all COVID-19 deaths in the country (N = 5797, during the studied period) 
was used. While 40.6% of the deaths are in cohorts with completed vaccination, 
this corresponds to 35.1% of years of life lost. The role of vaccination is 
expressed using YLS and hypothetical numbers of deaths. The registered number of 
deaths is approximately 3.5 times lower than it would be expected without 
vaccination. The results illustrate that vaccination is more effective in saving 
lives than suggested by simplistic comparisons.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cancer has become one of the major killers of humanity 
due to the number of people over the age of 75 increasing with population 
ageing. The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence and mortality rates 
in people over 75 of 29 cancer types in 204 countries and regions, as well as 
the trends from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Twenty-nine cancer types were collected from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2019 database( https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ ). We 
collected global cancer data for 2019 in terms of sex, age, sociodemographic 
index (SDI), region, etc. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was 
calculated to assess the trend of the cancer incidence and mortality rate from 
1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of new cancer cases and deaths among people 75 and 
older was almost 3 and 4.5 times that of 1990, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, 
there was a slow rise in incidence and a slight decline in mortality. There were 
significant differences in the cancer burden based on sex, age, region, and SDI. 
The cancer burden in men was higher than in women. In addition, the cancer 
burden varied from region to region. The highest cancer burden occurred in 
high-income North America. In addition, the higher the SDI was, the greater the 
burden of cancer. The incidence of cancer in high SDI was approximately seven 
times that of low SDI, and the trend of increase in high SDI was obvious. 
However, the trend of mortality in high SDI was decreasing, while it was 
increasing in low SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study focused on the cancer burden in adults over 
75 years old. The findings in the study could serve as the basis for an analysis 
of the types of cancers that are most prevalent in different regions. This is 
beneficial for strategies of prevention and treatment according to the 
characteristics of different countries and regions to reduce the burden of 
cancer in older adults.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the impact of healthy cardiovascular health (CVH) 
on diabetic complications, mortality, and life expectancy among people with type 
2 diabetes and to explore whether inflammation marker mediate these 
associations.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 33,236 participants (aged 40-72) 
with type 2 diabetes from the UK Biobank with annual follow-up from 2006 to 2010 
to 2020. Type 2 diabetes was ascertained from self-report, glycated 
hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%, hospital inpatient registry, or glucose-lowering medication 
use. Information on mortality was derived from the national death registry. 
Favorable CVH metrics consisted of non-smoker, regular physical activity, a 
healthy diet, non-overweight, untreated resting blood pressure < 120/<80 mm Hg, 
and untreated total cholesterol < 200 mg/dL. Participants were categorized into 
three groups according to the number of favorable CVH metrics: unfavorable (0 or 
1); intermediate (any 2 or 3); and favorable (4 or more). Inflammation marker, 
as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), was assessed at baseline and 
categorized as low (≤ 3 mg/L) and high (> 3 mg/L). Data were analyzed using Cox 
regression models, flexible parametric survival models, and mediation models.
RESULTS: During the follow-up (median: 11.7 years), 3133 (9.4%) cases of 
diabetes complications and 4701 (14.1%) deaths occurred. Compared to unfavorable 
CVH, favorable CVH was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes complications 
(HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 
0.43-0.65). In participants with unfavorable CVH, life expectancy at age 45 had 
a significantly reduction of 7.20 (95% CI, 5.48-8.92) years compared to those 
with a favorable CVH. Among people with type 2 diabetes, the proportions of 
diabetes complications and all-cause mortality that would be reduced by 
promoting the favorable CVH was 61.5% and 39.1%, respectively. CRP level 
mediated 14.3% and 29.7% of the associations between CVH and diabetic 
complication and all-cause mortality, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A favorable CVH was associated with lower risk of diabetes 
complications and mortality risk, and was associated with a longer life 
expectancy among people with type 2 diabetes. This association may be in part 
accounted for by inflammatory processes. Our findings highlight the importance 
of favorable CVH for the prevention of diabetic complications and all-cause 
mortality among people with type 2 diabetes, and underscores the need to monitor 
inflammation among people with unfavorable CVH.

In many countries, intervention costs are not covered by public health care. A 
critical basis for deciding whether an intervention is covered or not is to 
analyse the relation between benefits and costs of the intervention, and to 
quantify the consequential costs. In this study, a cost-utility analysis was 
computed to investigate the costs of individualized dyslexia intervention while 
quantifying the benefit in terms of health-related quality of life in a sample 
of 36 individuals with dyslexia. In addition, educational outcomes and costs of 
untreated dyslexia for the society were estimated using information for class 
repetition, school success, and unemployment rates from previous studies and 
official statistics. A significant increase in quality of life with medium 
effect sizes was found across all quality-of-life measures. Increases in quality 
of life were domain-specific, thus occurring specifically in those domains that 
are affected by learning disorders. The cost-utility ratio was 9,782 Euros per 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs), which is in line with similar therapy 
forms, such as speech therapy. The loss of productivity for untreated dyslexia 
in the German population was estimated for class repetition and reduced income 
due to lower school degrees. The cost-utility analysis and the calculation of 
consequential costs suggest that the dyslexia intervention is cost-effective.

Background: The skin is a major target organ for extrahepatic manifestations of 
liver diseases, and dermatologic abnormalities are common in patients with 
hepatic disorders. Clinical examination of the skin, nails and hair can allow 
for appropriate recognition, early diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases, 
and improvement in the quality of life and life expectancy of affected 
patients.Methods: We searched 3 databases (Pubmed,Medline and Embase) and 
selected studies about cirrhosis related skin manifestations and their 
pathophysiology.Results: A total of 73 articles were included in the review. 
Studies displayed the spectrum of cutaneous manifestations related to hormonal 
and vascular changes as well as nail and hair changes in patients with cirrhosis 
and/or portal hypertension.Conclusion: Cutaneous alterations are important clues 
or potential indications in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Familiarity with 
skin conditions can be promptly diagnosed and appropriate management 
initiated.KEY MESSAGESManifestations of the liver and skin disorders are 
interrelated in various ways. Cutaneous changes may be the first clue that a 
patient has liver disease.The skin is a major target organ for extrahepatic 
manifestations of liver diseases. A broad range of cutaneous alterations can be 
present in patients with cirrhosis, such as vascular, nail, hair, hormonal 
changes, etc.Recognizing these signs is crucial so that potential underlying 
diseases including liver disease can be promptly diagnosed and appropriate 
management timely initiated.

New technical concept for alternating tangential flow filtration in 
biotechnological cell separation processes.

and Bioprocess Engineering, Freising, Germany.

Robust cell retention devices are key to successful cell culture perfusion. 
Currently, tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow 
filtration (ATF) are most commonly used for this purpose. TFF, however, suffers 
from poor fouling mitigation, which leads to high filtration resistance and 
product retention, and ATF suffers from long residence times and cell 
accumulation. In this work, we propose a filtration system for alternating 
tangential flow filtration, which takes full advantage of the fouling mitigation 
effects of alternating flow and reduces cell accumulation. We have tested this 
novel setup in direct comparison with the XCell ATF® as well as TFF with a model 
feed comprising yeast cells and bovine serum albumin as protein at harsh 
permeate to feed flow conditions. We found that by avoiding the dead-end design 
of a diaphragm pump, the proposed filtration system exhibited a reduced 
filtration resistance by approximately 20% to 30% (depending on feed rate and 
permeate flow rate). A further improvement of the novel setup was reached by 
optimization of phase durations and flow control, which resulted in a fourfold 
extension of process duration until hollow fiber flow channel blockage occurred. 
Thus, the proposed concept appears to be superior to current cell retention 
devices in perfusion technology.

BACKGROUND: Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) occurs due to an entry tear in the 
intimal layer of the aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery 
where blood enters the newly formed false lumen (FL) and extends distally or 
proximally to form a dissection over an indeterminate length of the aorta which, 
over time, may eventually rupture. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) 
aims to seal off the entry tear proximally with the stent-graft, occluding the 
origin of the dissection and excluding the FL. Nevertheless, in some cases, the 
perfusion to the FL is maintained, hindering the aortic remodelling process and 
increasing the risk of aneurysmal degeneration and rupture, particularly in the 
abdominal aorta where evidence suggest that remodelling is slower. This review 
examines the long-term effects of a patent or partially thrombosed FL on 
clinical outcomes following TEVAR in TBAD, also highlighting the pathological 
processes behind negative aortic remodelling. Another aim of this review is to 
provide an overview and appraisal of the currently available techniques for 
managing a patent or partially thrombosed FL to prevent long-term morbidity 
occurring.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using several search 
engines including PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase to identify 
and extract relevant studies.
RESULTS: Evidence in the literature show that a partially thrombosed FL is more 
dangerous than a patent FL due to the occlusion of the distal re-entry tears, 
impeding outflow and increasing mean arterial and diastolic pressures, whereas 
the latter is decompressed via distal re-entry sites. FL thrombosis and 
satisfactory remodelling is sometimes achieved in as few as 40% of patients 
after TEVAR due to the maintained perfusion of the FL either at the level of the 
thoracic or abdominal aorta. However, although the thoracic aorta is 
predominantly covered by the TEVAR stent-graft, poorer remodelling and more 
dilation is seen in the abdominal aorta. Several techniques are available to 
embolize the FL, including the Provisional Extension to Induce Complete 
Attachment, Stent Assisted Balloon Induced Intimal Disruption and Relamination 
in Aortic Dissection Repair, candy-plug, and Knickerbocker techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of TBAD is invariably TEVAR to seal off the proximal 
entry tear while extending the repair distally to completely exclude the FL. A 
risk of aortic wall dilatation distal to TEVAR stent-graft remains; hence, 
regular monitoring and accurate imaging are essential. At present, a patent FL 
can be treated using a range of different endovascular techniques.

BACKGROUND: The palate is a structure separating the oral and nasal cavities and 
its integrity is essential for feeding and breathing. The total or partial 
opening of the palate is called a cleft palate and is a common malformation in 
mammals with environmental or hereditary aetiologies. Generally, it compromises 
life expectancy in the absence of surgical repair. A new form of non-syndromic 
cleft palate arose recently in Limousine cattle, with animals referred to the 
French National Observatory of Bovine Abnormalities since 2012. Since the number 
of affected animals has increased steadily, this study was undertaken to 
identify the cause of this disease.
RESULTS: Based on pedigree analysis, occurrence of cleft palate in Limousine 
cattle was concordant with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. 
Genotyping of 16 affected animals and homozygosity mapping led to the 
identification of a single disease-associated haplotype on Bos taurus chromosome 
(BTA)19. The genome of two affected animals was sequenced, and their sequences 
were compared to the ARS-UCD1.2 reference genome to identify variants. The 
likely causal variants were compared to the variant database of the 1000 bull 
genome project and two fully linked mutations in exon 24 of the MYH3 (myosin 
heavy chain) gene were detected: a 1-bp non-synonymous substitution 
(BTA19:g.29609623A>G) and a 11-bp frameshift deletion 
(BTA19:g.29609605-29609615del). These two mutations were specific to the 
Limousine breed, with an estimated allele frequency of 2.4% and are predicted to 
be deleterious. The frameshift leads to a premature termination codon. 
Accordingly, mRNA and protein analyses in muscles from wild-type and affected 
animals revealed a decrease in MYH3 expression in affected animals, probably due 
to mRNA decay, as well as an absence of the MYH3 protein in these animals. MYH3 
is mostly expressed in muscles, including craniofacial muscles, during 
embryogenesis, and its absence may impair palate formation.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new form of hereditary cleft palate in Limousine 
cattle. We identified two fully linked and deleterious mutations, ultimately 
leading to the loss-of-function of the MYH3 protein. The mutations were included 
on the Illumina EuroG10k v8 and EuroGMD v1 SNP chips and are used to set up a 
reliable eradication strategy in the French Limousine breed.

BACKGROUND: Lead exposure (LE) and its attributable deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have declined in the recent decade; 
however, it remains one of the leading public health concerns, particularly in 
regions with low socio-demographic index (SDI) such as the North Africa and 
Middle East (NAME) region. Hence, we aimed to describe the attributable burden 
of the LE in this region.
METHODS: Data on deaths, DALYs, years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with 
disability (YLDs) attributable to LE in the NAME region and its 21 countries 
from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 
study.
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized death and DALY rates attributable to LE 
were 23.4 (95% uncertainty interval: 15.1 to 33.3) and 489.3 (320.5 to 669.6) 
per 100,000 in the region, respectively, both of which were higher among men 
than women. The overall age-standardized death and DALY rates showed 27.7% and 
36.8% decreases, respectively, between 1990 and 2019. In this period, Bahrain, 
the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey had the highest decreases in the 
age-standardized death and DALY rates, while Afghanistan, Egypt, and Yemen had 
the lowest ones. Countries within high SDI quintile had lower attributable 
burden to LE compared with the low SDI quintile. Cardiovascular diseases and 
chronic kidney diseases accounted for the 414.2 (258.6 to 580.6) and 28.7 (17.7 
to 41.7) LE attributable DALYs per 100,000 in 2019, respectively. The 
attributable YLDs was 46.4 (20.7 to 82.1) per 100,000 in 2019, which shows a 
25.7% reduction (-30.8 to -22.5%) over 1990-2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall LE and its attributed burden by cause have decreased in 
the region from 1990-2019. Nevertheless, the application of cost-effective and 
long-term programs for decreasing LE and its consequences in NAME is needed.

BACKGROUND: Despite being two Baltic countries with similar histories, Estonia 
and Lithuania have diverged in life expectancy trends in recent years. We 
investigated this divergence by comparing cause-specific mortality trends.
METHODS: We obtained yearly mortality data for individuals 20 + years of age 
from 2001-2019 (19 years worth of data) through Statistics Lithuania, the 
Lithuanian Institute for Hygiene, and the National Institute for Health 
Development (Estonia). Using ICD-10 codes, we analyzed all-cause mortality rates 
and created eight major disease categories: ischemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, all other cardiovascular disease, cancers (neoplasms), 
digestive diseases, self-harm and interpersonal violence, unintentional injuries 
and related conditions, and other mortality (deaths per 100,000 population). We 
used joinpoint regression analysis, and analyzed the proportional contribution 
of each category to all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: There was a steeper decline in all-cause mortality in Estonia (average 
annual percent change, AAPC = -2.55%, 95% CI: [-2.91%, -2.20%], P < .001) as 
compared to Lithuania (AAPC = -1.26%, 95% CI: [-2.18%, -0.57%], P = .001). For 
ischemic heart disease mortality Estonia exhibited a relatively larger decline 
over the 19-year period (AAPC = -6.61%, 95% CI: [-7.02%, -6.21%], P < .001) as 
compared to Lithuania (AAPC = -2.23%, 95% CI: [-3.40%, -1.04%], P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Estonia and Lithuania showed distinct mortality trends and 
distributions of major disease categories. Our findings highlight the role of 
ischemic heart disease mortality. Differences in public health care, management 
and prevention of ischemic heart disease, alcohol control policies may explain 
these differences.

OBJECTIVE: To compare longer term (12-month) mortality outcomes for Indigenous 
and non-Indigenous people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective registry-based data linkage cohort 
study; analysis of all admissions of adults (16 years or older) to Australian 
ICUs, 1 January 2017 - 31 December 2019, as recorded in the Australian and New 
Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database (APD), linked 
using the SLK-581 key to National Death Index data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unadjusted and adjusted mortality risk, censored at 
twelve months from the start of index ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were 
unadjusted and adjusted mortality twelve months from admission to the ICU.
RESULTS: The APD recorded 330 712 eligible ICU admissions during 2017-2019 (65% 
of all ICU admissions registered), of which 11 322 were of Indigenous people 
(3.4%). Median age at admission was lower for Indigenous patients (51.2 [IQR, 
36.7-63.6] years) than for non-Indigenous patients (66.5 [IQR, 52.7-76.1] 
years). Unadjusted mortality risk was similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
patients (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.06), but was higher for Indigenous 
patients after adjusting for age, admission diagnosis, illness severity, 
hospital type, jurisdiction, remoteness and socio-economic status (adjusted 
hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.27). Twelve-month mortality was higher for 
Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 
1.16-1.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-month mortality outcomes are poorer for people admitted to 
ICUs in Australia than for the general population. Further, after adjusting for 
age and other factors, survival outcomes are poorer for Indigenous than 
non-Indigenous people admitted to ICUs. Critical illness may therefore 
contribute to shorter life expectancy among Indigenous Australians.

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to understand mental 
functioning in continuous valid dimensions ranging from functional to 
pathological. Reward processing is a transdiagnostic functioning domain of the 
RDoC. Due to prototypical abnormalities, addictions are especially applicable 
for the investigation of reward processing. Subjective reward processing is 
challenging to determine and differs between genotypes of the 
catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism for incomparable 
daily life experiences. Thus, we implemented the monetary incentive delay (MID) 
task with comparable reward cues and visual analog scales (VAS) to assess 
subjective reward processing in male abstinent cannabis-dependent individuals (N 
= 13) and a control group of nicotine smokers (N = 13). COMT Val158Met genotypes 
were nominally associated with differences in cigarettes smoked per day and 
motivation in the MID Task (p = 0.028; p = 0.017). For feedback gain, activation 
of the right insula was increased in controls, and activation correlated with 
gain expectancy and satisfaction about gain. Subjective value is not detached 
from reward parameters, but is modulated from expectancy and reward by the 
insula. The underlying neural mechanisms are a fundamental target point for 
treatments, interventions, and cognitive behavioral therapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although a relatively recent concept for developing 
countries, the developed world has been using League Tables as a policy guiding 
tool for a comprehensive assessment of health expenditures; country-specific 
"League tables" can be a very useful tool for national healthcare planning and 
budgeting. Presented herewith is a comprehensive league table of cost per 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) 
ratios derived from Health Technology Assessment (HTA) or economic evaluation 
studies reported from India through a systematic review.
METHODS: Economic evaluations and HTAs published from January 2003 to October 
2019 were searched from various databases. We only included the studies 
reporting common outcomes (QALY/DALY) and methodology to increase the 
generalizability of league table findings. To opt for a uniform criterion, a 
reference case approach developed by Health Technology Assessment in India 
(HTAIn) was used for the reporting of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
However, as, most of the articles expressed the outcome as DALY, both (QALY and 
DALY) were used as outcome indicators for this review.
RESULTS: After the initial screening of 9,823 articles, 79 articles meeting the 
inclusion criteria were selected for the League table preparation. The spectrum 
of intervention was dominated by innovations for infectious diseases (33%), 
closely followed by maternal and child health (29%), and non-communicable 
diseases (20%). The remaining 18% of the interventions were on other groups of 
health issues, such as injuries, snake bites, and epilepsy. Most of the 
interventions (70%) reported DALY as an outcome indicator, and the rest (30%) 
reported QALY. Outcome and cost were discounted at the rate of 3 by 73% of the 
studies, at 5 by 4% of the studies, whereas 23% of the studies did not discount 
it. Budget impact and sensitivity analysis were reported by 18 and 73% of the 
studies, respectively.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present review offers a reasonably coherent 
league table that reflects ICER values of a range of health conditions in India. 
It presents an update for decision-makers for making decisions about resource 
allocation.

Effects of microenvironment in osteosarcoma on chemoresistance and the promise 
of immunotherapy as an osteosarcoma therapeutic modality.

University, Changchun, China.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common primary malignant tumors originating 
in bones. Its high malignancy typically manifests in lung metastasis leading to 
high mortality. Although remarkable advances in surgical resection and 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy have lengthened life expectancy and greatly improved 
the survival rate among OS patients, no further breakthroughs have been 
achieved. It is challenging to treat patients with chemoresistant tumors and 
distant metastases. Recent studies have identified a compelling set of links 
between hypoxia and chemotherapy failure. Here, we review the evidence 
supporting the positive effects of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
In addition, certain anticancer effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors have 
been demonstrated in OS preclinical models. Continued long-term observation in 
clinical trials is required. In the present review, we discuss the mutualistic 
effects of the TME in OS treatment and summarize the mechanisms of immunotherapy 
and their interaction with TME when used to treat OS. We also suggest that 
immunotherapy, a new comprehensive and potential antitumor approach that 
stimulates an immune response to eliminate tumor cells, may represent an 
innovative approach for the development of a novel treatment regimen for OS 
patients.

Morbidity is one of the key aspects for assessing populations' well-being. In 
particular, chronic diseases negatively affect the quality of life in the old 
age and the risk that more years added to lives are years of disability and 
illness. Novel analysis, interventions and policies are required to understand 
and potentially mitigate this issue. In this article, we focus on investigating 
whether in Italy the compression of morbidity is in act in the recent years, 
parallely to an increase of life expectancy. Our analysis rely on large repeated 
cross-sectional data from the national surveillance system passi, providing deep 
insights on the evolution of morbidity together with other socio-demographical 
variables. In addition, we investigate differences in morbidity across 
subgroups, focusing on disparities by gender, level of education and economic 
difficulties, and assessing the evolution of these differences across the period 
2013-2019.
