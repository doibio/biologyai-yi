STUDY DESIGN: Topic review.
OBJECTIVE: Describe value measurement in spine care and discuss the motivation 
for, methods for, and limitations of such measurement.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal disorders are common and are an important 
cause of pain and disability. Numerous complementary and competing treatment 
strategies are used to treat spinal disorders, and the costs of these treatments 
is substantial and continue to rise despite clear evidence of improved health 
status as a result of these expenditures.
METHODS: The authors present the economic and legislative imperatives forcing 
the assessment of value in spine care. The definition of value in health care 
and methods to measure value specifically in spine care are presented. 
Limitations to the utility of value judgments and caveats to their use are 
presented.
RESULTS: Examples of value calculations in spine care are presented and 
critiqued. Methods to improve and broaden the measurement of value across spine 
care are suggested, and the role of prospective registries in measuring value is 
discussed.
CONCLUSION: Value can be measured in spine care through the use of appropriate 
economic measures and patient-reported outcomes measures. Value must be 
interpreted in light of the perspective of the assessor, the duration of the 
assessment period, the degree of appropriate risk stratification, and the 
relative value of treatment alternatives.

and ††Department of Neurological Surgery, Case Western Reserve University, 
MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize and critically review the economic literature evaluating 
the cost-effectiveness of minimal access surgery (MAS) compared with 
conventional open procedures for the cervical and lumbar spine.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MAS techniques may improve perioperative parameters 
(length of hospital stay and extent of blood loss) compared with conventional 
open approaches. However, some have questioned the clinical efficacy of these 
differences and the associated cost-effectiveness implications. When considering 
the long-term outcomes, there seem to be no significant differences between MAS 
and open surgery.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration database, University of 
York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (NHS-EED and HTA), and the Tufts CEA 
Registry were reviewed to identify full economic studies comparing MAS with open 
techniques prior to December 24, 2013, based on the key questions established a 
priori. Only economic studies that evaluated and synthesized the costs and 
consequences of MAS compared with conventional open procedures (i.e., 
cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, or cost-utility) were 
considered for inclusion. Full text of the articles meeting inclusion criteria 
were reviewed by 2 independent investigators to obtain the final collection of 
included studies. The Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument was scored 
by 2 independent reviewers to provide an initial basis for critical appraisal of 
included economic studies.
RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 198 potentially relevant citations, and 6 
studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating the costs and consequences of MAS 
versus conventional open procedures performed for the lumbar spine; no studies 
for the cervical spine met the inclusion criteria. Studies compared MAS tubular 
discectomy with conventional microdiscectomy, minimal access transforaminal 
lumbar interbody fusion versus open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, and 
multilevel hemilaminectomy via MAS versus open approach.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the included cost-effectiveness studies generally supported 
no significant differences between open surgery and MAS lumbar approaches. 
However, these conclusions are preliminary because there was a paucity of 
high-quality evidence. Much of the evidence lacked details on methodology for 
modeling, related assumptions, justification of economic model chosen, and 
sources and types of included costs and consequences. The follow-up periods were 
highly variable, indirect costs were not frequently analyzed or reported, and 
many of the studies were conducted by a single group, thereby limiting 
generalizability. Prospective studies are needed to define differences and 
optimal treatment algorithms.

Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To identify cost-effective treatment strategies for lumbar spine 
degenerative diseases.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a paucity of literature assisting 
physicians and society regarding the cost-efficiency of management of lumbar 
spine conditions. Limited articles on selective operative and nonoperative 
therapies have been published for a variety of lumbar conditions.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration data 
base, University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (National Health 
Services Economic Evaluation Database and health technology assessment), and the 
Tufts CEA Registry was conducted through December 16, 2013. Three specific 
questions were addressed for adult patients: (1) What is the evidence that 
surgery is cost-effective compared with nonsurgical management for lumbar 
degenerative spondylolisthesis or stenosis? (2) What is the evidence that fusion 
is cost-effective compared with no fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis or 
stenosis? and (3) What is the evidence that instrumentation is cost-effective 
compared with none for degenerative spondylolisthesis? The Quality of Health 
Economic Studies instrument was used to provide an initial basis for critical 
appraisal of included economic studies. Articles were further refined with 
individual review based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Initial search resulted in 122 potentially relevant citations, 115 of 
which were excluded at title and abstract levels and 3 at full-text reviews, 
leaving 5 for analysis. No non-English language text met inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. All studies illustrated a clinical benefit of surgical treatment as 
measured by quality-adjusted life year (0.11-8.05). Surgical treatments had a 
greater financial cost than nonoperative care ($5883-$26,035). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio calculations noted operative treatment over 
nonoperative treatment for spondylolisthesis ($59,487-$115,600) per 
quality-adjusted life year. However, cost for patients without spondylolisthesis 
varied greatly from nonoperative treat dominating to $77,600 per 
quality-adjusted life year favoring surgery. Because the articles had 
heterogeneous methods and patient population, conclusion differed greatly on 
cost assessment.
CONCLUSION: Limited quality data exist on cost-effective treatment of 
degenerative lumbar spinal conditions, despite more recent interest related to 
this topic. It is important that future research efforts focus on constructing 
higher quality trials in this area to help determine the most cost-effective 
care.

Health economic studies: an introduction to cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, 
and cost-utility analyses.

Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY; and †Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, 
University of California, San Francisco, CA.

STUDY DESIGN: Narrative overview.
OBJECTIVE: To provide clinicians with a basic understanding of economic studies, 
including cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analyses.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: As decisions regarding public health policy, 
insurance reimbursement, and patient care incorporate factors other than 
traditional outcomes such as satisfaction or symptom resolution, health economic 
studies are increasingly prominent in the literature. This trend will likely 
continue, and it is therefore important for clinicians to have a fundamental 
understanding of the common types of economic studies and be able to read them 
critically. In this brief article, the basic concepts of economic studies and 
the differences between cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility 
studies are discussed.
METHODS: An overview of the field of health economic analysis is presented.
RESULTS: Cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility studies all 
integrate cost and outcome data into a decision analysis model. These different 
types of studies are distinguished mainly by the way in which outcomes are 
valued. Obtaining accurate cost data is often difficult and can limit the 
generalizability of a study.
CONCLUSION: With a basic understanding of health economic analysis, clinicians 
can be informed consumers of these important studies.

As part of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) process, the endonuclease XPG is 
involved in repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions, but the protein has also 
been implicated in several other DNA repair systems, complicating 
genotype-phenotype relationship in XPG patients. Defects in XPG can cause either 
the cancer-prone condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) alone, or XP combined with 
the severe neurodevelopmental disorder Cockayne Syndrome (CS), or the infantile 
lethal cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome, characterized by dramatic 
growth failure, progressive neurodevelopmental abnormalities and greatly reduced 
life expectancy. Here, we present a novel (conditional) Xpg-/- mouse model which 
-in a C57BL6/FVB F1 hybrid genetic background- displays many progeroid features, 
including cessation of growth, loss of subcutaneous fat, kyphosis, osteoporosis, 
retinal photoreceptor loss, liver aging, extensive neurodegeneration, and a 
short lifespan of 4-5 months. We show that deletion of XPG specifically in the 
liver reproduces the progeroid features in the liver, yet abolishes the effect 
on growth or lifespan. In addition, specific XPG deletion in neurons and glia of 
the forebrain creates a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype that shows many 
characteristics of human XPG deficiency. Our findings therefore exclude that 
both the liver as well as the neurological phenotype are a secondary consequence 
of derailment in other cell types, organs or tissues (e.g. vascular 
abnormalities) and support a cell-autonomous origin caused by the DNA repair 
defect itself. In addition they allow the dissection of the complex aging 
process in tissue- and cell-type-specific components. Moreover, our data 
highlight the critical importance of genetic background in mouse aging studies, 
establish the Xpg-/- mouse as a valid model for the severe form of human XPG 
patients and segmental accelerated aging, and strengthen the link between DNA 
damage and aging.

BACKGROUND: Still increasing life expectancy in patients with implanted devices 
and large number of leads more and more often induce the need to cure the 
treatment complications or to change especially to cardiac resynchronization 
therapy (CRT). In order to prevent further complications, the possibility of 
damaged or redundant leads extraction should be taken into consideration. The 
aim of the paper was to assess the effectiveness and safety of transvenous lead 
extraction (TLE) with co-implantation of resynchronization systems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and March 2013, the system removal with TLE 
was conducted in 246 patients. In 38 patients (11 women, 28.9%), aged 43-79 
(mean 65 years), it was combined with co-implantation of CRT-pacemaker or 
defibrillator (CRT-P/D). Indications for TLE covered: lead failure in 21 (55.3%) 
patients, redundant leads in 6 (15.8%), and the occluded venous system in 7 
(18.4%). The up-grade of the pacemaker or defibrillator system to CRT-D was 
performed in 19 cases, CRT-P/D revision in next 19. Together 32 defibrillation 
leads and 42 pacing leads (27 left ventricular leads, and 1 epicardial lead) 
were implanted. The intended clinical target--an effective resynchronization 
therapy--was obtained in all patients. There was no case of death or severe 
complications. In 2 cases of venous occlusion, the implantation on the 
contralateral side was required.
CONCLUSIONS: TLE enables effective resynchronization therapy also in the case of 
the presence of too many leads, occlusion of the venous system or lead failure. 
Significant technical problems can occur especially in patients with venous 
system occlusion.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest 
malignancies with an overall life expectancy of 6 months despite current 
therapies. NF-κB signalling has been shown to be critical for this profound 
cell-autonomous resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs and death 
receptor-induced apoptosis, but little is known about the role of the c-Rel 
subunit in solid cancer and PDAC apoptosis control. In the present study, by 
analysis of genome-wide patterns of c-Rel-dependent gene expression, we were 
able to establish c-Rel as a critical regulator of tumour necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in PDAC. 
TRAIL-resistant cells exhibited a strong TRAIL-inducible NF-κB activity, whereas 
TRAIL-sensitive cells displayed only a small increase in NF-κB-binding activity. 
Transfection with siRNA against c-Rel sensitized the TRAIL-resistant cells in a 
manner comparable to siRNA targeting the p65/RelA subunit. Gel-shift analysis 
revealed that c-Rel is part of the TRAIL-inducible NF-κB complex in PDAC. Array 
analysis identified NFATc2 as a c-Rel target gene among the 12 strongest 
TRAIL-inducible genes in apoptosis-resistant cells. In line, siRNA targeting 
c-Rel strongly reduced TRAIL-induced NFATc2 activity in TRAIL-resistant PDAC 
cells. Furthermore, siRNA targeting NFATc2 sensitized these PDAC cells against 
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Finally, TRAIL-induced expression of COX-2 was 
diminished through siRNA targeting c-Rel or NFATc2 and pharmacologic inhibition 
of COX-2 with celecoxib or siRNA targeting COX-2, enhanced TRAIL apoptosis. In 
conclusion, we were able to delineate a novel c-Rel-, NFATc2- and 
COX-2-dependent antiapoptotic signalling pathway in PDAC with broad clinical 
implications for pharmaceutical intervention strategies.

About 334 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, and this figure may be an 
underestimation. It is the most common chronic disease in children. Asthma is 
among the top 20 chronic conditions for global ranking of disability-adjusted 
life years in children; in the mid-childhood ages 5-14 years it is among the top 
10 causes. Death rates from asthma in children globally range from 0.0 to 0.7 
per 100 000. There are striking global variations in the prevalence of asthma 
symptoms (wheeze in the past 12 months) in children, with up to 13-fold 
differences between countries. Although asthma symptoms are more common in many 
high-income countries (HICs), some low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) also 
have high levels of asthma symptom prevalence. The highest prevalence of 
symptoms of severe asthma among children with wheeze in the past 12 months is 
found in LMICs and not HICs. From the 1990s to the 2000s, asthma symptoms became 
more common in some high-prevalence centres in HICs; in many cases, the 
prevalence stayed the same or even decreased. At the same time, many LMICs with 
large populations showed increases in prevalence, suggesting that the overall 
world burden is increasing, and that therefore global disparities in asthma 
prevalence are decreasing. The costs of asthma, where they have been estimated, 
are relatively high. The global burden of asthma in children, including costs, 
needs ongoing monitoring using standardised methods.

1. A trial was conducted to study the effect of Melissa officinalis 
supplementation on organic broiler performance and meat chemical, 
microbiological, sensory and nutritional quality. 2. Male and female day-old 
Ross 308 chicks were fed on a standard commercial diet containing 0, 2.5, 5 or 
10 g/kg feed ground M. officinalis for 84 d before slaughter. 3. Weight gain and 
feed conversion ratio were significantly improved in the broilers receiving 
either 5 or 10 mg M. officinalis/kg feed. 4. Inclusion of M. officinalis did not 
affect muscle chemical and fatty acid composition. 5. On the basis of 
microbiological and sensory experimental data and subsequent extension of meat 
shelf life, M. officinalis did not reduce the microbial populations of the meat, 
but was effective in limiting lipid oxidation.

BACKGROUND: Two-thirds of people with dementia live at home, receiving most care 
from family carers, about 40% of whom have clinically significant depression or 
anxiety. This impacts on the person with dementia, families and society, 
predicting care breakdown. There are currently no clinically effective and 
cost-effective NHS family carer interventions.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the STrAtegies for RelaTives (START) intervention in the 
short (4 and 8 months) and long term (1 and 2 years) compared with treatment as 
usual (TAU).
DESIGN: Randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial with blinded assessment 
recruiting participants 2:1 (intervention to TAU) to allow for therapist 
clustering.
SETTING: Three UK mental health services and one neurological service.
PARTICIPANTS: Family carers of people with dementia.
INTERVENTION: Eight-session manual-based coping intervention delivered by 
supervised psychology graduates to individuals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Affective symptoms [Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale-total (HADS-T)] and cost-effectiveness. Secondary measures: anxiety and 
depression symptoms and caseness, quality of life (QoL), abusive behaviour and 
long-term care home admission.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty participants were randomised (173 intervention, 
87 TAU). We used intention-to-treat analysis in the short term (152 
intervention, 77 TAU) and in the long term (140 intervention, 69 TAU). In the 
short term, the intervention group had lower HADS-T [mean difference -1.80, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -3.29 to -0.31; p=0.02] and higher quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) (mean difference 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.08). Costs were no 
different between groups [mean £ 252 (95% CI -£ 28 to £ 565) for intervention 
group]. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed a greater than 99% 
chance of being cost-effectiveness at a £ 30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold and a high probability of cost-effectiveness based on the HADS-T 
score. Carers in the intervention group had less case-level depression [odds 
ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76], a trend towards reduced case-level 
anxiety (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.05), lower Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale-anxiety (HADS-A) (-0.91, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.07; p = 0.03) and Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression (HADS-D) (-0.91, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.10; 
p = 0.03) and higher Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ) QoL (mean difference 
4.09, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.83). Group differences in abusive behaviour (OR 0.48, 95% 
CI 0.18 to 1.27) and the person with dementia's quality of life-Alzheimer's 
disease (QoL-AD) (mean increase 0.59, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.89) were not 
significant. In the long term, the intervention group had lower HADS-T (mean 
difference -2.58, 95% CI -4.26 to -0.90; p = 0.03) and higher QALYs (mean 
difference 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06). Carers in the intervention group had 
less case-level depression (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.53), a trend towards 
reduced case-level anxiety (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.24), lower HADS-A (-1.16, 
95% CI -2.15 to -0.18) and HADS-D (1.45, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.57), and higher HSQ 
(mean difference 7.47, 95% CI 2.87 to 12.08). Thirty-two (18.7%) people with 
dementia in the intervention group and 17 (20.2%) in TAU were admitted to a care 
home (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.56; p = 0.56). There were no 
significant differences between groups in abusive behaviour (OR 0.83, 95% CI 
0.36 to 1.94), the person with dementia's QoL-AD (0.17, 95% CI -1.37 to 1.70) or 
costs (£ 336, 95% CI -£ 223 to £ 895) for intervention group. The probability 
that the intervention would be seen as cost-effective at £ 30,000/QALY threshold 
and cost-effectiveness on the HADS-T remained high.
CONCLUSIONS: The START intervention was clinically effective and cost-effective 
in the short and longer term. The results are robust to the sensitivity analyses 
performed. Future work is needed to consider mechanism of action; the effects on 
people with dementia in clinical terms (cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
longer-term care home admission); and on health and social care costs. In 
addition, we will explore the effects of carer abusive behaviour on the care 
recipient's care home admission and if this then reduces abusive behaviour. We 
would also like to implement START and evaluate this implementation in clinical 
practice.

Thrombosis is a common pathology underlying ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic 
stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). The Global Burden of Disease Study 
2010 (GBD 2010) documented that ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively 
caused one in four deaths worldwide. GBD 2010 did not report data for VTE as a 
cause of death and disability. We performed a systematic review of the 
literature on the global disease burden due to VTE in low, middle and high 
income countries. Studies from Western Europe, North America, Australia, and 
Southern Latin America (Argentina) yielded consistent results with annual 
incidences ranging from 0.75 to 2.69 per 1,000 individuals in the population. 
The incidence increased to between 2 and 7 per 1,000 among those 70 years of age 
or more. Although the incidence is lower in individuals of Chinese and Korean 
ethnicity, their disease burden is not low because of population aging. VTE 
associated with hospitalisation was the leading cause of 
disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) lost in low and middle income countries, 
and second in high income countries, responsible for more DALYs lost than 
nosocomial pneumonia, catheter-related blood stream infections, and adverse drug 
events. VTE causes a major burden of disease across low, middle, and high income 
countries. More detailed data on the global burden of VTE should be obtained to 
inform policy and resource allocation in health systems, and to evaluate if 
improved utilisation of preventive measures will reduce the burden.

BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatment are recognized risk factors for venous 
thromboembolism (VTE). Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are utilized to provide 
mechanical thromboprophylaxis to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) or to avoid 
bleeding from systemic anticoagulation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 107 cancer patients who had 
IVC filters inserted and followed up at our institution was performed. All 
patients had active cancer; a majority (> 90%) had advanced-stage disease, 
whereas only five patients (5.8%) had stages I or II disease.
RESULTS: Eighty six patients (80.3%) had their IVC filter placed through a 
jugular approach. Filter insertion was not without complications; recurrent deep 
vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported in 10 (9.3%), PE in three (2.8%) and filter 
thrombosis in one patient. The value of IVC filter in patients with advanced 
stage disease was very limited: among 59 patients with stage IV disease for whom 
survival data was available, the median survival was only 1.31 months 
(0.92-2.20) with 23 patients (39.0%) surviving less than a month, and 40 (67.8%) 
surviving less than three months.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic anticoagulation can be safely offered for the majority of 
cancer patients. When the risk of bleeding or PE is high, IVC filters can be 
utilized. However, the placement of such filters should take into consideration 
the stage of disease and life expectancy of such patients. Patients with 
advanced-stage disease may gain little benefit from IVC filter insertion.

Organ transplantation represents one of the major milestones of modern medicine 
and surgical practice in terms of life-years prolonged and quality of life 
offered for chronic patients. Each year over 100,000 donor organ transplants are 
performed worldwide. In spite of the rapid advancement and expansion of this 
niche, it has become a victim of its own success as the donor supply is far 
oustripped by the demand for replacement organs. Furthermore, current methods 
only allow for successful transplantation in the setting of life-long, 
aggressive immunosuppression protocols which enhances the incidence of secondary 
neoplasm and other associated sequelae. Against this background, recent advances 
in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and cellular biology 
have coalesced into a promising new avenue of investigation involving the 
fabrication of de novo, transplantable organs using autologous cells. Donor 
organs are stripped of their native cellular material leaving only acellular, 
extracellular matrix constructs behind. These constructs can then be 
recellularized with a patient's own cells in order to form transplantable organs 
that do not require immunosuppression. Furthermore, in theory, these methods 
could provide a potentially inexhaustible source of organs to meet the growing 
need for viable transplants. In this review, we describe these methods as well 
as contemporary successes for various organ systems.

risk factors : findings of a multicenter study.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The risk to die from an infectious disease in Germany has 
been continuously decreasing over the last century. Since infections are, 
however, not only causes of death but risk factors for diseases like 
cardiovascular diseases, it is essential to monitor and analyze their prevalence 
and frequency, especially in consideration of the increased life expectancy. To 
gain more knowledge about infectious diseases as risk factors and their 
implications on the condition and change of the immune status, the German 
National Cohort (GNC), a population-based prospective cohort study, will recruit 
200,000 subjects between 2014 and 2017. In Pretest 1, a feasibility study for 
the GNC, we evaluated a self-administered and self-report questionnaire on 
infectious diseases and on the use of health care facilities (hereinafter called 
"ID Screen") for feasibility and validity.
METHODS: From August-November 2011, 435 participants between the ages of 20-69 
completed the ID Screen. All subjects had been recruited via a random sample 
from the local residents' registration offices by 4 of the 18 participating 
study centers. The questionnaire encompasses 77 variables in six sections 
assessing items such as 12-month prevalence of infections, cumulative prevalence 
of infectious diseases, visit of health care facilities and vaccination. The 
feasibility was amongst others evaluated by assessing the completeness and 
comprehensiveness of the questionnaire. To assess the questionnaires ability to 
measure "immune status" and "susceptibility to infections", multivariate 
analysis was used.
RESULTS: The overall practicability was good and most items were well 
understood, demonstrated by < 2/33 missing questions per questionnaire and only 
three variables: vaccination for influenza and pneumococci and infection with 
chickenpox had a frequency > 5 % of missing values. However, direct comparison 
of the items 12-month prevalence and lifetime prevalence of nephritis/pyelitis 
showed poor agreement and thereby poor understanding by 80 % of the 
participants, illustrating the necessity for a clear, lay person appropriate 
description of rare diseases to increase comprehensibility. The questionnaire 
will be used to support the assessment of immune dysfunction and frequency of 
infection. An analysis of these constructs in an exploratory factor analysis 
revealed limited applicability due to low interitem correlation (Cronbach's 
α < 0.5). This is corroborated by the extraction of more than one factor with a 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of 0.6 instead of a unidimensional latent construct 
for "immune status".
CONCLUSION: All in all, the ID Screen is a good and reliable tool to measure 
infectious diseases as risk factors and outcome in general, but requires a 
better translation of infection specific terms into lay person terms. For the 
assessment of the overall immune status, the tool has strong limitations. 
Vaccinations status should also rather be assessed based on vaccination 
certificates than on participants' recall.

EINFÜHRUNG/ZIELE: Infektionskrankheiten sind in Industrieländern nicht mehr die 
führenden Ursachen für Morbidität und Mortalität. Als Risikofaktoren für 
nichtübertragbare, wie z. B. kardiovaskuläre Krankheiten, spielen sie jedoch 
nach wie vor eine wichtige Rolle. In der Nationalen Kohorte (NaKo), einer 
prospektiven Kohortenstudie, die zwischen 2014 und 2017 in Deutschland den 
Gesundheitszustand von 200.000 Bürgern misst, ist die Erfassung von Infektionen 
und ihren Risikofaktoren eine hervorgehobene Komponente. Im Pretest 1 zur NaKo 
wurde ein Fragebogen, der u. a. Infektionen und medizinische Behandlungen 
mittels Selbstangabe und Selbsteinschätzung erfasst (ID-Screen), auf Machbarkeit 
und Vollständigkeit evaluiert.
METHODE: Im Zeitraum von August bis November 2011 füllten in 4 der 18 
teilnehmenden Studienzentren 435 über die Einwohnermeldeämter ermittelte 
Probanden im Alter zwischen 20 und 69 den Fragebogen aus. Dieser bestand aus 
77 Variablen in 6 Abschnitten und erfasste unter anderem 12-Monats- und 
Lebenszeitprävalenzen von Infektionen, Klinikbesuchen und Impfungen. Zur 
Evaluierung wurden die Ergebnisse auf Vollständigkeit und Verständnis überprüft. 
Zudem wurde mittels multivariater Analyse ermittelt, ob der Fragebogen wie 
geplant den Immunstatus und die Infektanfälligkeit erfasst.
ERGEBNIS: Der Fragenbogen war gut verständlich und wurde von den Probanden 
akzeptiert, wie man der geringen Zahl an fehlenden Daten pro Fragebogen 
(< 2/33 Fragen) entnehmen konnte. Zudem hatten nur die 3 Fragen zu Impfungen 
gegen Influenza, Impfungen gegen Pneumokokken sowie zu Infektionen mit 
Windpocken mehr als 5 % fehlende Messwerte. Vergleicht man die Erfassung der 
12-Monats-Prävalenz und der Lebenszeitprävalenz für 
Nieren-/Nierenbeckeninfektionen, so findet man bei 4 von den 5 betroffenen 
Probanden (80 %) eine mangelnde Übereinstimmung. Dies verdeutlicht, dass 
medizinische Begriffe und seltene Erkrankungen für Laien als Zielpersonen 
entsprechend erklärt werden müssen. Um die Eignung des ID-Screens zur Messung 
des Immunstatus und der Infektanfälligkeit zu bestimmen, wurde eine explorative 
Faktorenanalyse durchgeführt. Hier hat sich u. a. gezeigt, dass für das 
Konstrukt „Immunstatus“ eine zu geringe Inter-Item-Korrelation (Cronbach’s α 
< 0,5) vorliegt und mit einem KMO von 0,6 mehr als ein Faktor extrahiert wurde. 
Somit lässt sich der Immunstatus mit dem ID-Screen nicht als eine latente 
Variable abbilden.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Der Fragebogen ist ein geeignetes Instrument, um 
Infektionskrankheiten zu erfassen. Für Laien als Zielgruppe sollten Fachbegriffe 
jedoch besser übersetzt werden. Um den Immunstatus als solchen zu erfassen, hat 
der ID-Screen starke Einschränkungen. Statt in einer erinnerungsbasierten 
Impfabfrage sollten Impfungen besser über die Informationen im Impfpass erfasst 
werden.

This article presents an original study commissioned by the UK charity, Together 
for Short Lives which explored children and young people up to 25 years of age 
with life-threatening/limiting conditions and their families. Using Appreciative 
Inquiry and framework analysis, qualitative work sought to explore perceived met 
and unmet needs of services and care. Fifty-one families were interviewed from 
one UK area, 18 of which were children/young people up to 25 years old. Findings 
indicated that children and their families felt medical/nursing needs were well 
met but provision was needed for broader financial, social and emotional support 
alongside more responsive specialist therapies.

Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease and a potentially disabling illness, 
whose prevalence has increased in recent years alongside the aging population. 
The disability associated with this condition generates a brutal impact on 
individuals who are limited in their basic daily living activities. The increase 
in life expectancy is not correlated with an increase in quality of life, since 
the years of life increase, but characterized for living with disabilities.

Publisher: La osteoartritis es una enfermedad articular crónica y potencialmente 
discapacitante, cuya prevalencia se ha incrementado en los últimos años a la par 
del envejecimiento poblacional. La discapacidad asociada a esta patología genera 
un impacto brutal en los individuos, que ven limitadas sus actividades básicas 
de la vida diaria. El incremento en la esperanza de vida no se correlaciona con 
un incremento en la calidad de esta última, pues aumentan los años de vida, pero 
de vida con discapacidad.

Prescription and adherence to medical therapy for heart failure are 
disappointing despite convincing randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, beta-blockade, and aldosterone 
antagonism. In this study, we report an imbalanced approach amongst clinicians, 
who describe focusing during patient consultations on perceived risks of therapy 
rather than survival benefits. Only one-half of clinicians mention increased 
lifespan, and very few suggest to the patient how large this gain might be. We 
calculate from the available RCT data that, for patients whose lifespan is 
limited by heart failure, triple therapy triples lifespan.

Surgical and interventional therapies for peripheral artery disease (PAD) are 
notorious for high rates of failure. Interactions between the artery and repair 
materials play an important role, but comprehensive data describing the 
physiological and mechanical characteristics of human femoropopliteal arteries 
are not available. Fresh femoropopliteal arteries were obtained from 70 human 
subjects (13-79 years old), and in situ vs. excised arterial lengths were 
measured. Circumferential and longitudinal opening angles were determined for 
proximal superficial femoral, proximal popliteal and distal popliteal arteries. 
Mechanical properties were assessed by multi-ratio planar biaxial extension, and 
experimental data were used to calculate physiological stresses and stretches, 
in situ axial force and anisotropy. Verhoeff-Van Gieson-stained axial and 
transverse arterial sections were used for histological analysis. Most specimens 
demonstrated nonlinear deformations and were more compliant longitudinally than 
circumferentially. In situ axial pre-stretch decreased 0.088 per decade of life. 
In situ axial force and axial stress also decreased with age, but 
circumferential physiological stress remained constant. Physiological 
circumferential stretch decreased 55-75% after 45 years of age. Histology 
demonstrated a thickened external elastic lamina with longitudinally oriented 
elastin that was denser in smaller, younger arteries. Axial elastin likely 
regulates axial pre-stretch to help accommodate the complex deformations 
required of the artery wall during locomotion. Degradation and fragmentation of 
elastin as a consequence of age, cyclic mechanical stress and atherosclerotic 
arterial disease may contribute to decreased in situ axial pre-stretch, 
predisposing to more severe kinking of the artery during limb flexion and loss 
of energy-efficient arterial function.

Disease-associated malnutrition (DAM) is a well-recognized problem in many 
countries, but the extent of its burden on the Chinese population is unclear. 
This article reports the results of a burden-of-illness study on DAM in 15 
diseases in China. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
China Health and Nutrition Survey, and the published literature, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost because of DAM were calculated; a 
financial value of this burden was calculated following WHO guidelines. DALYs 
lost annually to DAM in China varied across diseases, from a low of 2248 in 
malaria to a high of 1 315 276 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The 
total burden was 6.1 million DALYs, for an economic burden of US$66 billion 
(Chinese ¥ 447 billion) annually. This burden is sufficiently large to warrant 
immediate attention from public health officials and medical providers, 
especially given that low-cost and effective interventions are available.

delivery in hypoxia.

We tested the hypothesis that the time constants (τ) of postexercise T2* MRI 
signal intensity (an index of O2 delivery) and muscle [PCr] (an index of 
metabolic perturbation, measured by (31)P-MRS) in hypoxia would be accelerated 
after dietary nitrate (NO3 (-)) supplementation. In a double-blind crossover 
design, eight moderately trained subjects underwent 5 days of NO3 (-) (beetroot 
juice, BR; 8.2 mmol/day NO3 (-)) and placebo (PL; 0.003 mmol/day NO3 (-)) 
supplementation in four conditions: normoxic PL (N-PL), hypoxic PL (H-PL; 13% 
O2), normoxic NO3 (-) (N-BR), and hypoxic NO3 (-) (H-BR). The single-leg 
knee-extension protocol consisted of 10 min of steady-state exercise and 24 s of 
high-intensity exercise. The [PCr] recovery τ was greater in H-PL (30 ± 4 s) 
than H-BR (22 ± 4 s), N-PL (24 ± 4 s) and N-BR (22 ± 4 s) (P < 0.05) and the 
maximal rate of mitochondrial ATP resynthesis (Qmax) was lower in the H-PL (1.12 
± 0.16 mM/s) compared with H-BR (1.35 ± 0.26 mM/s), N-PL (1.47 ± 0.28 mM/s), and 
N-BR (1.40 ± 0.21 mM/s) (P < 0.05). The τ of postexercise T2* signal intensity 
was greater in H-PL (47 ± 14 s) than H-BR (32 ± 10 s), N-PL (38 ± 9 s), and N-BR 
(27 ± 6 s) (P < 0.05). The postexercise [PCr] and T2* recovery τ were correlated 
in hypoxia (r = 0.60; P < 0.05), but not in normoxia (r = 0.28; P > 0.05). These 
findings suggest that the NO3 (-)-NO2 (-)-NO pathway is a significant modulator 
of muscle energetics and O2 delivery during hypoxic exercise and subsequent 
recovery.
