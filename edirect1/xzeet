Bioactive packaging can improve the shelf-life of food products and enhance 
consumer health. It can also alleviate environmental stress on the planet by 
reducing food waste. Here, the electrospinning of tea tree oil-loaded 
2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan nanofibers was investigated. 
The fabricated nanofiber films were characterized by scanning electron 
microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy, and contact angle meter analysis. The prepared nanofibers have a 
well-defined diameter of about 200 nm and a smooth shape. They have good 
antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in 
vitro. Tea tree oil-loaded chitosan-based nanofibers were found to be effective 
in delaying spoilage and extending the shelf life of salmon by sensory 
evaluation, texture analysis, color, total viable counts, thiobarbituric acid, 
and total volatile basic nitrogen during storage in the freshness experiments, 
thus indicating their health benefits in bioactive packaging.

BACKGROUND: The period from 6 to 24 months in an infant's life presents a 
critical window for understanding feeding practices and for designing culturally 
appropriate interventions. However, little is known about the complementary 
feeding practices of Black mothers and how this period can be used to optimise 
the long-term health of their children. The present study aimed to identify 
factors that influence the complementary feeding practices of low-income Black 
mothers with children aged 6-24 months.
METHODS: Participants were recruited through Research Match, Facebook 
advertising, flyers, and snowballing techniques. Low-income, Black mothers, with 
a 6-24-month-old infant, and who lived in Franklin County, Ohio, USA, were 
eligible for the study. A cross-sectional design using in-depth interviews was 
used. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilised to analyse and interpret the 
feeding practices of Black mothers.
RESULTS: Mothers (n = 8) were aged between 18 and 30 years old and most 
completed college or had some college education (n = 6). Half (n = 4) were 
married, employed, and rated their diet quality and their children's as very 
good. Three themes emerged: (a) complementary feeding at ≥ 6 months of age; (b) 
involvement of health care providers and service organisations in feeding 
decisions; and (c) use of responsive feeding cues.
CONCLUSIONS: All mothers breastfed exclusively and most (n = 6) initiated 
complementary feeding at 6 months. Paediatricians, other health providers and 
service organisations were instrumental in helping Black mothers adopt 
complementary feeding practices. Mothers also engaged in responsive feeding 
practices. These findings point to the critical nature of access and education 
in helping Black mothers in the study achieve feeding recommendations for their 
infants.

Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly 
limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular 
targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal entrapment of 
internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and 
construct peptides that enable endosome-to-cytosol delivery based on an 
extension of the "histidine switch" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys 
residues in cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we 
obtained peptides with pH-dependent membrane-perturbation activity. These 
peptides do not randomly penetrate cells like CPPs, but imitate the endosomal 
escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16-residue 
peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular 
fusion proteins and achieved antibody-targeted delivery of diverse protein 
cargoes-including the pro-apoptotic protein BID (BH3-interacting domain death 
agonist) and Cre recombinase-into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. 
After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice 
ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab-hsLMWP-BID fusion conferred strong 
anti-tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein 
features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo 
combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout 
life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, and 
immunotherapy.

With the improvement of the average life expectancy and increasing incidence of 
obesity, the burden of liver disease is increasing. Liver disease is a serious 
threat to human health. Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective 
treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, liver transplantation still 
faces unavoidable difficulties. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used as an 
alternative therapy for liver disease, especially liver cirrhosis, liver 
failure, and liver transplantation complications. However, MSCs may have 
potential tumorigenic effects. Exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-Exos), as the 
important intercellular communication mode of MSCs, contain various proteins, 
nucleic acids, and DNA. MSC-Exos can be used as a delivery system to treat liver 
diseases through immune regulation, apoptosis inhibition, regeneration 
promotion, drug delivery, and other ways. Good histocompatibility and material 
exchangeability make MSC-Exos a new treatment for liver diseases. This review 
summarizes the latest research on MSC-Exos as delivery vehicles in different 
liver diseases, including liver injury, liver failure, liver fibrosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and ischemia and reperfusion injury. In 
addition, we discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and clinical application 
prospects of MSC-Exos-based delivery vectors in the treatment of liver diseases.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a common symptom of hemophilia that may adversely affect 
patients' quality of life (QoL). Previous post hoc analyses of prophylaxis with 
recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) have been published for adults 
and adolescents, demonstrating improvements in health-related QoL (HRQoL) when 
assessed by the haemophilia-specific QoL (HaemAQoL) questionnaire.
OBJECTIVE: To describe in depth the evolution of QoL, pain- and activity-related 
domains and questions for pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with 
hemophilia B treated with rFIXFc prophylaxis.
DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of data from a series of clinical trials.
METHODS: This post hoc, long-term analysis assessed patient-reported outcomes 
(PROs) from the Kids B-LONG (NCT01440946: pediatric) and B-LONG (NCT01027364: 
adults and adolescents) parent studies and the B-YOND (NCT01425723: all age 
groups) extension study.
RESULTS: Ninety-two adult and adolescent patients that started in the B-LONG 
study were assessed, with a median (range) duration of follow-up of 58.9 
(0.0-78.4) months. The Haem-A-QoL total score was significantly reduced from 
baseline by 4.45 (p ⩽ 0.01), as were the subdomains 'physical health' (9.10; 
p = 0.001), 'sports and leisure' (11.25; p ⩽ 0.01), 'treatment' (2.69; 
p = 0.05), and 'view of self' (5.81; p = 0.002). Thirty pediatric patients that 
started in the Kids B-LONG study were assessed, with a median (min-max) duration 
of follow-up of 36.7 (9.0-59.9) months. The high level of satisfaction 
demonstrated by the PROs at baseline was maintained.
CONCLUSION: rFIXFc prophylaxis reduced perceived pain and increased levels of 
physical activity with sustained, long-term improvements in QoL in adult and 
adolescent patients with hemophilia B and maintained high QoL scores in 
pediatric patients.

Plain Language Summary: Helping to reduce pain and increase physical activity in 
patients with hemophilia B People with hemophilia B do not produce factor IX 
(FIX) that works properly, so they need to be given additional FIX to help their 
blood clot. Recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc), is an extended 
half-life (meaning it remains active for longer than standard, unmodified FIX) 
treatment for hemophilia B. People with hemophilia B can experience episodes of 
bleeding, which can result in other symptoms, including pain, difficulty 
participating in sport, and poor mental health. This study shows that regularly 
taking rFIXFc over approximately 5 years to prevent or treat bleeds could also 
help to make these other symptoms better.

Early-onset Marfan syndrome (eoMFS) progresses rapidly, starting during the 
neonatal period, causes severe clinical disease, and has a poor prognosis. The 
genetic abnormality associated with eoMFS is located in a so-called critical 
neonatal region in exons 25-26 of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. A female neonate 
was delivered by emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks gestation due to fetal 
distress with bradycardia, cyanosis, and no spontaneous breathing. On 
examination, the patient had multiple musculoskeletal deformities, including 
loose redundant skin, arachnodactyly, flat soles, and joint contractures. 
Echocardiography showed poor cardiac contractility with multiple valvular 
abnormalities. She died 13 h after birth. We identified a novel missense variant 
c.3218A>G (p.Glu1073Gly) in exon 26 of the FBN1 gene by targeted next-generation 
sequencing. A literature review revealed that arachnodactyly and aortic root 
dilatation in the fetus are predictive of eoMFS. However, the predictive 
potential of ultrasonography alone is limited. Genetic testing of the FBN1 gene 
restriction region associated with short life expectancy and characteristic 
fetal ultrasound findings could be important for prenatal diagnosis of eoMFS, 
postnatal management, and parental preparedness.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: We identified a novel missense mutation located in exons 
25-26 of the Fibrillin-1 gene in a neonate with early-onset Marfan syndrome 
(eoMFS) who died of severe early heart failure shortly after birth. This 
mutation was located in a narrowly defined critical neonatal region, recently 
reported to cause eoMFS, and its clinical profile was consistent with 
early-onset severe heart failure. In addition to ultrasonography, genetic 
analysis of this region is important for predicting prognosis in eoMFS.

Background: Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is the fourth highest cause of cancer 
mortality worldwide. Alterations in copper metabolism are closely linked to 
cancer genesis and progression. We aim to identify the prognostic value of 
copper metabolism-related genes (CMRGs) in STAD and the characteristic of the 
tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of the CMRG risk model. Methods: CMRGs were 
investigated in the STAD cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. 
Then, the hub CMRGs were screened out with LASSO Cox regression, followed by the 
establishment of a risk model and validated by GSE84437 from the Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. The hub CMRGs were then utilized to create a nomogram. 
TMB (tumor mutation burden) and immune cell infiltration were investigated. To 
validate CMRGs in immunotherapy response prediction, immunophenoscore (IPS) and 
IMvigor210 cohort were employed. Finally, data from single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) was utilized to depict the properties of the hub CMRGs. Results: 
There were 75 differentially expressed CMRGs identified, 6 of which were linked 
with OS. 5 hub CMRGs were selected by LASSO regression, followed by construction 
of the CMRG risk model. High-risk patients had a shorter life expectancy than 
those low-risk. The risk score independently predicted STAD survival through 
univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, with ROC calculation 
generating the highest results. This risk model was linked to immunocyte 
infiltration and showed a good prediction performance for STAD patients' 
survival. Furthermore, the high-risk group had lower TMB and somatic mutation 
counters and higher TIDE scores, but the low-risk group had greater IPS-PD-1 and 
IPS-CTLA4 immunotherapy prediction, indicating a higher immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) response, which was corroborated by the IMvigor210 cohort. 
Furthermore, those with low and high risk showed differential susceptibility to 
anticancer drugs. Based on CMRGs, two subclusters were identified. Cluster 2 
patients had superior clinical results. Finally, the copper metabolism-related 
TIME of STAD was concentrated in endothelium, fibroblasts, and macrophages. 
Conclusion: CMRG is a promising biomarker of prognosis for patients with STAD 
and can be used as a guide for immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Gout is a common and debilitating condition that is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, the 
global burden of gout continues to increase, particularly in 
high-sociodemographic index (SDI) regions.
OBJECTIVE: To address the aforementioned issue, we used age-period-cohort (APC) 
modeling to analyze global trends in gout incidence and prevalence from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to 
assess all-age prevalence and age-standardized prevalence rates, as well as 
years lived with disability rates, for 204 countries and territories. APC 
effects were also examined in relation to gout prevalence. Future burden 
prediction was carried out using the Nordpred APC prediction of future incidence 
cases and the Bayesian APC model.
RESULTS: The global gout incidence has increased by 63.44% over the past 2 
decades, with a corresponding increase of 51.12% in global years lived with 
disability. The sex ratio remained consistent at 3:1 (male to female), but the 
global gout incidence increased in both sexes over time. Notably, the prevalence 
and incidence of gout were the highest in high-SDI regions (95% uncertainty 
interval 14.19-20.62), with a growth rate of 94.3%. Gout prevalence increases 
steadily with age, and the prevalence increases rapidly in high-SDI quantiles 
for the period effect. Finally, the cohort effect showed that gout prevalence 
increases steadily, with the risk of morbidity increasing in younger birth 
cohorts. The prediction model suggests that the gout incidence rate will 
continue to increase globally.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides important insights into the global burden of 
gout and highlights the need for effective management and prophylaxis of this 
condition. The APC model used in our analysis provides a novel approach to 
understanding the complex trends in gout prevalence and incidence, and our 
findings can inform the development of targeted interventions to address this 
growing health issue.

OBJECTIVES: Non-small-cell lung cancer mortality has declined at a faster rate 
than incidence due to multiple factors, including changes in smoking behaviour, 
early detection which shifts diagnosis, and novel therapies. Limited resources 
require that we quantify the contribution of early detection versus novel 
therapies in improving lung cancer survival outcomes.
METHODS: Non-small-cell lung cancer patients from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data were queried and divided into: (i) 
stage IV diagnosed in 2015 (n = 3774) and (ii) stage I-III diagnosed in 
2010-2012 (n = 15 817). Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models were 
performed to assess the independent association of immunotherapy or diagnosis at 
stage I/II versus III with survival.
RESULTS: Patients treated with immunotherapy had significantly better survival 
than those who did not (HRadj: 0.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.56), as did 
those diagnosed at stage I/II versus stage III (HRadj: 0.36, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.35-0.37). Patients on immunotherapy had a 10.7-month longer survival 
than those who were not. Stage I/II patients had an average survival benefit of 
34 months, compared to stage III. If 25%% of stage IV patients not on 
immunotherapy received it, there would be a gain of 22 292 person-years survival 
per 100 000 diagnoses. A switch of only 25% from stage III to stage I/II would 
correspond to 70 833 person-years survival per 100 000 diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, earlier stage at diagnosis contributed to 
life expectancy by almost 3 years, while gains from immunotherapy would 
contribute ½ year of survival. Given the relative affordability of early 
detection, risk reduction through increased screening should be optimized.

Objectives. To test the hypothesis that law enforcement efforts to disrupt local 
drug markets by seizing opioids or stimulants are associated with increased 
spatiotemporal clustering of overdose events in the surrounding geographic area. 
Methods. We performed a retrospective (January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021), 
population-based cohort study using administrative data from Marion County, 
Indiana. We compared frequency and characteristics of drug (i.e., opioids and 
stimulants) seizures with changes in fatal overdose, emergency medical services 
nonfatal overdose calls for service, and naloxone administration in the 
geographic area and time following the seizures. Results. Within 7, 14, and 21 
days, opioid-related law enforcement drug seizures were significantly associated 
with increased spatiotemporal clustering of overdoses within radii of 100, 250, 
and 500 meters. For example, the observed number of fatal overdoses was two-fold 
higher than expected under the null distribution within 7 days and 500 meters 
following opioid-related seizures. To a lesser extent, stimulant-related drug 
seizures were associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering overdose. 
Conclusions. Supply-side enforcement interventions and drug policies should be 
further explored to determine whether they exacerbate an ongoing overdose 
epidemic and negatively affect the nation's life expectancy. (Am J Public

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents 32% of all global deaths. 
Studies have shown an increase in CVD prevalence and mortality with the most 
substantial increase in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Within 
LMICs, we sought to 1) measure the burden of CVD with respect to aortic aneurysm 
(AA), ischemic stroke (IS), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD); 2) quantify 
surgical access to vascular surgery services; and 3) identify challenges and 
solutions to addressing disparities.
METHODS: The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of 
Disease Results Tool was used to assess the global burden of CVD (AA, PAD, IS). 
Population data were extracted from the World Bank & Workforce data. A 
literature review was completed through PubMed.
RESULTS: The number of deaths attributable to AA, PAD, and IS in LMICs increased 
by up to 102% between 1990 and 2019. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost 
to AA, PAD, and IS in LMICs also increased by up to 67%. High-income countries 
(HIC) had a less considerable increase in deaths and DALYs during this time 
period. There are 101 and 72.7 vascular surgeons per 10 million people in the 
United States and United Kingdom, respectively. LMICs, such as Morocco, Iran, 
and South Africa have 10 times less this number. Ethiopia has 0.25 vascular 
surgeons per 10 million people, 400 times less than the United States. 
Interventions addressing these global disparities should address infrastructure 
and financing, data collection and sharing, patient knowledge and beliefs, and 
workforce development.
CONCLUSIONS: Extreme regional discrepancies are evidence at a global scale. 
Identifying mechanisms to expand the vascular surgical workforce to meet the 
increasing need for vascular surgical access is imminent.

Nanopesticides (Npes) carry the potential of increased efficacy while reducing 
application rates, hence increasing agricultural productivity in a more 
sustainable way. However, given its novelty, the environmental risk assessment 
of these advanced materials is mostly absent. In the present study we 
investigated the ecotoxicity of a commercial insecticide, with reported 
nanofeatures, Karate Zeon®, and compared it to its active substance 
lambda-cyhalothrin. It is hypothesised that the use of the nanopesticide Karate 
Zeon® poses lower risk to enchytraeids than its active substance. The standard 
non-target soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus was used, and exposure was 
done in LUFA 2.2 soil in 4 tests (endpoints: days): avoidance test [avoidance 
behaviour: 2 days], OECD standard reproduction test [survival, reproduction plus 
adults' size: 28 days] and its extension [total number organisms: 56 days], and 
Full Life Cycle (FLC) test [hatching and juveniles' size: 13 days; survival, 
reproduction and adults' size: 46 days]. Results showed that enchytraeids did 
not avoid Karate Zeon® nor its active substance lambda-cyhalothrin, which could 
be due to neurotoxicity. There was no indication of increased toxicity with 
prolonged exposure (46, 56d) compared to the standard (28d) for neither of the 
materials, being overall equally toxic in terms of hatching, survival, and 
reproduction. The FLCt results indicated that the juvenile stage was the most 
sensitive, resulting in higher toxicity for the adult animals when exposed from 
the cocoon stage. Although toxicity was similar between Karate Zeon and 
lambda-cyhalothrin, different patterns of uptake and elimination cannot be 
excluded. The benefits of using Karate Zeon will rely on reduced application 
rates.

BACKGROUND: Perioperative dexamethasone as an adjunct to multimodal analgesia, 
has an opioid-sparing and pain alleviating effect after total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA), however, the 3-year effects are unknown. We aimed to investigate the 
3-year effect of 1 (DX1) or 2 (DX2) intravenous doses of 24 mg dexamethasone or 
placebo on pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life after 
TKA.
METHODS: Patients who participated in the Dexamethasone Twice for Pain Treatment 
after TKA (DEX-2-TKA) were invited to physical tests and questionnaires 
(self-reported characteristics, Oxford Knee Score, EuroQol-5Dimensions-5Levels 
(EQ5D5L), and PainDetect). The tests were 40-meter Fast Paced Walk (40FPW) test, 
Timed Up and Go (TUG), 30 Second Chair Stand test (30CST), Stair Climb Test 
(SCT), bilateral knee Range of Motion, and knee extension torque. For each test 
the peak pain intensity was registered on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale. 
Primary outcome was average peak pain intensity during the 40FPW, TUG, 30CST and 
SCT. Secondary outcomes were the tests and questionnaires. Out of 252 eligible 
patients, 133 (52.8%) underwent the tests and 160 (63.5%) answered the 
questionnaires. Mean follow-up time was 33 months (range, 23 to 40).
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) peak pain intensity was 0 (0 to 65) for 
the DX2 group, 0 (0 to 51) for DX1 group and 0 (0 to 70) for the placebo group 
(P = .72). No differences in secondary outcomes were identified.
CONCLUSION: One or 2 intravenous doses of 24 mg dexamethasone did not impact 
chronic pain development or physical function 3 years after TKA.

Objective　In Japan, measures to prevent frailty among older adults have been 
implemented. Promotion of social participation is a key measure, but few 
longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between the types and number 
of social participation and frailty onset. In this study, we aimed to clarify 
the relationship between the types and number of social participation and 
frailty onset using longitudinal data from a large sample of older adults in 
municipalities in Japan.Methods　We used the 2016 and 2019 panel survey data from 
the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES). The analysis included 59,545 
individuals from 28 municipalities who responded to the JAGES survey in both 
2016 (at baseline) and 2019 (at follow-up). We excluded individuals who were 
dependent on activities of daily living at baseline and non-responders, and 
those who were frail or with no information about frailty. The dependent 
variable was frailty onset (≥8 out of 25 points on the basic checklist) at 
follow-up, and the independent variables were the types and number of types of 
social participation at baseline. We included 11 variables as potential 
confounders. We used multiple imputations to complete the missing values and 
used modified Poisson regression to examine the association between social 
participation and risk of frailty onset.Results　Of the 59,545 participants, 
6,431 (10.8%) were frail onset at follow-up. After multiple imputations (minimum 
64,212, maximum 64,287), the risk of frailty onset at follow-up was lower for 
eight types of social participation, excluding senior citizens' clubs, (nursing 
care [risk ratio; 0.91], paid work [0.90], volunteer groups [0.87], neighborhood 
associations [0.87], learning or cultural groups [0.87], activities intended to 
teach skills or pass experiences to others [0.85], hobby groups [0.81], and 
sports groups or clubs [0.80]; P<0.05), than no social participation. 
Additionally, individuals who participated in more types of social participation 
were at a lower risk of frailty than those with no social participation (P for 
trend <0.001).Conclusions　The risk of frailty onset was lower among individuals 
who participated in eight types of social participation at baseline and among 
those who participated in more types of social participation than those with no 
social participation. The results suggest that social participation is a useful 
measure to prevent frailty for extending healthy life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a health economic sub-study within a feasibility RCT 
comparing a non-operative treatment pathway as an alternative to appendicectomy 
for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children. The 
objectives were to understand and assess data collection tools and methods and 
to determine indicative costs and benefits assessing the feasibility of 
conducting a full economic evaluation within the definitive trial.
METHODS: We compared different methods of estimating treatment costs including 
micro-costing, hospital administrative data (PLICS) and health system (NHS) 
reference costs. We compared two different HRQoL instruments (CHU-9D and 
EQ-5D-5L) in terms of data completeness and sensitivity to change over time, 
including potential ceiling effects. We also explored how the timing of data 
collection and duration of the analysis could affect QALYs (Quality Adjusted 
Life Years) and the results of the cost-utility analysis (CUA) within the future 
RCT.
RESULTS: Using a micro-costing approach, the total per treatment costs were in 
alignment with hospital administrative data (PLICS). Average health system 
reference cost data (macro-costing using NHS costs) could potentially 
underestimate these treatment costs, particularly for non-operative treatment. 
Costs incurred following hospital discharge in the primary care setting were 
minimal, and limited family borne costs were reported by parents/carers. While 
both HRQoL instruments performed relatively well, our results highlight the 
problem of ceiling effect and the importance of the timing of data collection 
and the duration of the analysis in any future assessment using QALYs and CUA.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted the importance of obtaining accurate 
individual-patient cost data when conducting economic evaluations. Our results 
suggest that timing of data collection and duration of the assessment are 
important considerations when evaluating cost-effectiveness and reporting cost 
per QALY.

NF2-schwannomatosis is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome 
associated with meningioma. Meningioma in NF2-schwannomatosis is a major source 
of morbidity and mortality. This is due to accumulative tumor burden in patients 
with synchronous schwannomas and ependymomas, sometimes including complex 
collision tumors. Balancing the impact of multiple interventions against the 
natural history of various index tumors, and the ongoing risk of de novo tumors 
over an individual's lifetime makes decision-making complex. The management of 
any given individual meningioma is often different from a comparable sporadic 
tumor. There is typically a greater emphasis on conservative management and 
tolerating growth until a risk boundary is reached, whereby symptomatic 
deterioration or higher risk from anticipated future treatment is threatened. 
Management by high-volume multidisciplinary teams improves quality of life and 
life expectancy. Surgery remains the mainstay treatment for symptomatic and 
rapidly enlarging meningioma. Radiotherapy has an important role but carries a 
higher risk compared to its use in sporadic disease. Whilst bevacizumab is 
effective in NF2-associated schwannoma and cystic ependymoma, it has no value in 
the management of meningioma. In this review, we describe the natural history of 
the disease, underlying genetic, molecular, and immune microenvironment changes, 
current management paradigms, and potential therapeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION: Assessing vital sign measurements within hospital settings 
presents a valuable opportunity for data analysis and knowledge extraction. By 
generating adaptable, personalized prediction models of patient vital signs, 
these models can yield clinically relevant insights not achievable through 
population-based models. This study aims to compare several statistical 
forecasting models to determine their real-life applicability.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this paper are to evaluate whether the 
following measurements: blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature and heart 
rate can predict deterioration in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. 
Additionally, we aim to identify which of these measurements contributes most 
significantly to our prediction. Lastly, we seek to determine the most accurate 
data mining technique for real-life data applications.
METHODS: This retrospective chart review study utilized data from patients 
admitted to the ICU at a tertiary hospital between January and December, 2019. 
Data mining techniques for prediction included logistic regression, support 
vector machine classifier, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting 
classifier, and Naive Bayes classifier. A comprehensive comparison of these 
techniques was performed, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and 
F-measure.
RESULTS: To achieve the research objectives, the SelectKBest class was applied 
to extract the most contributory features for prediction. Blood pressure ranked 
first with a score of 9.98, followed by respiratory rate, temperature, and heart 
rate. Analysis of 653 patient records indicated that 129 patients expired, while 
542 patients were discharged either to their homes or other facilities. Among 
the five training models, two demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting 
patient deterioration or survival at 88.83% and 84.72%, respectively. The 
gradient boosting classifier accurately predicted 115 out of 129 expired 
patients, while the KNN correctly predicted 109 out of 129 expired patients.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning has the potential to enhance clinical deterioration 
prediction compared to traditional methods. This allows healthcare professionals 
to implement preventative measures and improve patients' quality of life, 
ultimately increasing average life expectancy. Although our research focused 
exclusively on ICU patients, data mining techniques can be applied in various 
contexts both within and outside the hospital setting.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of developing 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). As speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) has 
been used to detect subclinical myocardial abnormalities, this study aims to 
detect early cardiac impairment among Asian PLWH using STE and to investigate
