that occurred in the 11 years (1999-2009) since the previously reported study. 
For females, the dose response was consistent with linearity with an estimated 
ERR of 0.64 per Gy (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.77). For males, significant upward 
curvature over the full dose range as well as restricted dose ranges was 
observed and therefore, a linear-quadratic model was used, which resulted in an 
ERR of 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.28) at 1 Gy and an ERR of 0.010 (95% CI: -0.0003 
to 0.021) at 0.1 Gy. The shape of the ERR dose response was significantly 
different among males and females (P = 0.02). While there was a significant 
decrease in the ERR with increasing attained age, this decrease was more rapid 
in males compared to females. The lowest dose range that showed a statistically 
significant dose response using the sex-averaged, linear ERR model was 0-100 mGy 
(P = 0.038). In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that solid cancer risks 
remain elevated more than 60 years after exposure. Sex-averaged upward curvature 
was observed in the dose response independent of adjustment for smoking. 
Findings from the current analysis regarding the dose-response shape were not 
fully consistent with those previously reported, raising unresolved questions. 
At this time, uncertainties in the shape of the dose response preclude 
definitive conclusions to confidently guide radiation protection policies. 
Upcoming results from a series of analyses focusing on the radiation risks for 
specific organs or organ families, as well as continued follow-up are needed to 
fully understand the nature of radiation-related cancer risk and its public 
health significance. Data and analysis scripts are available for download at:

Patients with extensive burn injuries suffer from multisystem trauma, which 
affects their medical, psychological, and social well-being for many years. 
Monitoring those patients has revealed changes in the endocrine, cardiac, and 
respiratory systems years after the injury. Our study tries to examine whether 
changes manifest as a higher risk of death during their lifespan, compared with 
the general population. Data from the years 1998 to 2013 regarding two groups of 
patients was obtained from a national trauma registry: one group had suffered 
burns over 20% of their TBSA and survived the hospitalization period and the 
second group was a control group of patients admitted with minimal trauma 
(Injury Severity Score = 1-minor injury to a single body region). Mortality 
rates during the posthospitalization period were compared after adjusting for 
age and follow-up periods. The authors collected 1115 second- or third-degree 
burn victims with 20% TBSA and 81,688 trauma victims with an Injury Severity 
Score = 1. Follow-up periods ranged from 8 months to almost 17 years. When 
comparing the groups after correcting for age, sex, and follow-up period, no 
significant differences in mortality risk were found. Possible explanations for 
the lack of differences in mortality risk include the lack of an adequate 
follow-up period, a misguided research hypothesis (ie, despite existence of 
physiological changes in burn patients, these changes do not affect the 
lifespan), or a control group that does not optimally represent mortality in the 
general population.

BACKGROUND: A depressed scapular alignment could lead to prolonged and 
repetitive stress or compression of the brachial plexus, resulting in 
sensitization of neural tissue. However, no study has investigated the influence 
of alignment of the scapulae on sensitization of upper limb neural tissue in 
otherwise asymptomatic people. In this case-control study, we investigate the 
influence of a depressed scapular alignment on mechanosensitivity of the upper 
limb peripheral nervous system as well as pressure pain thresholds (PPT).
METHODS: Asymptomatic individuals with neutral vertical scapular alignment 
(n = 25) or depressed scapular alignment (n = 25) participated. We measured the 
upper limb neurodynamic test (ULNT1), including assessment of symptom response 
and elbow range of motion (ROM), and PPT measured over upper limb peripheral 
nerve trunks, the upper trapezius muscle and overlying cervical zygapophyseal 
joints.
RESULTS: Subjects with a depressed scapular reported significantly greater pain 
intensity (t = 5.7, p < 0.0001) and reduced elbow extension ROM (t = -2.7, 
p < 0.01) during the ULNT1 compared to those with a normal scapular orientation. 
Regardless of the location tested, the group presenting with a depressed 
scapular had significantly lower PPT compared to those with a normal scapular 
orientation (PPT averaged across all sites: normal orientation: 
3.3 ± 0.6 kg/cm2, depressed scapular: 2.1 ± 0.5 kg/cm2, p < 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite being asymptomatic, people with a depressed scapular have 
greater neck and upper limb neural tissue mechanosensitivity when compared to 
people with a normal scapular orientation. This study offers insight into the 
potential development of neck-arm pain due to a depressed scapular position.

OBJECTIVE: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with high medical costs and 
especially with high productivity costs, in particular in patients in their 
working years. High molecular weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid (HA) is an 
alternative treatment for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, which are known 
for their serious side-effects. The cost-utility of intraarticular HMW-HA 
treatment in these patients is unknown, however, and was assessed in this study.
METHODS: Secondary care patients ages 18-65 years with knee OA were randomized 
to usual care plus HMW-HA (intervention group) or to usual care only (control 
group). A cost-utility analysis over 52 weeks from the societal and health care 
perspective was performed. Uncertainty for costs, effects, and cost-utility 
ratio was analyzed by nonparametric bootstrapping. Baseline imbalance adjustment 
was done by inverse probability of treatment weighting.
RESULTS: In total, 156 subjects were included (intervention group n = 77, 
control group n = 79). The total of productivity and medical costs was €475 
higher in the intervention group at €7,754 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
5,426, 10,436) versus €7,270 (95% CI 5,453, 9,262). The amount of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during followup was also higher in 
the intervention group (0.779 versus 0.727). This variation resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €9,100/QALY from a societal perspective 
and €8,700/QALY from a health care perspective. When the maximum willingness to 
pay for conditions similar to knee OA is considered, the probability on 
cost-effectiveness is 64% and 86%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Intraarticular HMW-HA added to usual care for knee OA is probably 
cost-effective in the treatment of knee OA.

Plants/plant-derived components have been used from ancient times to treat/cure 
several human diseases. Plants and their parts possess several chemical 
components that play the vital role in the improvement of human health and their 
life expectancy. Allopathic medicines have been playing a key role in the 
treatment of several diseases. Though allopathic medicines provide fast relief, 
long time consumption cause serious health concerns such as hyperallergic 
reactions, liver damage, etc. So, the study of medicinal plants which rarely 
cause any side effect is very important to mankind. Plants contain many health 
benefit properties like antioxidant, anti-aging, neuroprotective, 
anti-genotoxic, anti-mutagenic and bioinsecticidal activity. Thus, 
identification of pharmacological properties of plants/plant-derived components 
are of utmost importance to be explored. Several model organisms have been used 
to identify the pharmacological properties of the different plants or active 
components therein and Drosophila is one of them. Drosophila melanogaster "fruit 
fly" is a well understood, high-throughput model organism being used more than 
110 years to study the different biological aspects related to the development 
and diseases. Most of the developmental and cell signaling pathways and ∼75% 
human disease-related genes are conserved between human and Drosophila. Using 
Drosophila, one can easily analyze the pharmacological properties of 
plants/plant-derived components by performing several assays available with 
flies such as survivorship, locomotor, antioxidant, cell death, etc. The current 
review focuses on the potential of Drosophila melanogaster for the 
identification of medicinal/pharmacological properties associated with 
plants/plant-derived components.

BACKGROUND: After a single-center trial and observational studies suggesting 
that early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) reduced mortality from septic shock, 
three multicenter trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe) showed no benefit. This 
meta-analysis of individual patient data from the three recent trials was 
designed prospectively to improve statistical power and explore heterogeneity of 
treatment effect of EGDT.
METHODS: We harmonized entry criteria, intervention protocols, outcomes, 
resource-use measures, and data collection across the trials and specified all 
analyses before unblinding. After completion of the trials, we pooled data, 
excluding the protocol-based standard-therapy group from the ProCESS trial, and 
resolved residual differences. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. 
Secondary outcomes included 1-year survival, organ support, and hospitalization 
costs. We tested for treatment-by-subgroup interactions for 16 patient 
characteristics and 6 care-delivery characteristics.
RESULTS: We studied 3723 patients at 138 hospitals in seven countries. Mortality 
at 90 days was similar for EGDT (462 of 1852 patients [24.9%]) and usual care 
(475 of 1871 patients [25.4%]); the adjusted odds ratio was 0.97 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.82 to 1.14; P=0.68). EGDT was associated with greater mean (±SD) use 
of intensive care (5.3±7.1 vs. 4.9±7.0 days, P=0.04) and cardiovascular support 
(1.9±3.7 vs. 1.6±2.9 days, P=0.01) than was usual care; other outcomes did not 
differ significantly, although average costs were higher with EGDT. Subgroup 
analyses showed no benefit from EGDT for patients with worse shock (higher serum 
lactate level, combined hypotension and hyperlactatemia, or higher predicted 
risk of death) or for hospitals with a lower propensity to use vasopressors or 
fluids during usual resuscitation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of individual patient data, EGDT did not 
result in better outcomes than usual care and was associated with higher 
hospitalization costs across a broad range of patient and hospital 
characteristics. (Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences

The identification of a dysferlin-deficient animal model that accurately 
displays both the physiological and behavior aspects of human dysferlinopathy is 
critical for the evaluation of potential therapeutics. Disease progression in 
dysferlin-deficient mice is relatively mild, compared to the debilitating human 
disease which manifests in impairment of particular motor functions. Since there 
are no other known models of dysferlinopathy in other species, locomotor 
proficiency and muscular anatomy through MRI (both lower leg and hip region) 
were evaluated in dysferlin-deficient B6.A-Dysfprmd /GeneJ (Bla/J) mice to 
define disease parameters for therapeutic assessment. Despite the early and 
progressive gluteal muscle dystrophy and significant fatty acid accumulation, 
the emergence of significant motor function deficits was apparent at 
approximately 1 year of age for standard motor challenges including the rotarod, 
a marble bury test, grip strength, and swimming speed. Earlier observations of 
decreased performance for Bla/J mice were evident during extended monitoring of 
overall exploration and rearing activity. Comprehensive treadmill gait analyses 
of the Bla/J model indicated significant differences in paw placement angles and 
stance in relation to speed and platform slope. At 18 months of age, there was 
no significant difference in the life expectancy of Bla/J mice compared to wild 
type. Consistent with progressive volume loss and fatty acid accumulation in the 
hip region observed by MRI, mass measurement of individual muscles confirmed 
gluteal and psoas muscles were the only muscles demonstrating a significant 
decrease in muscle mass, which is analogous to hip-girdle weakness observed in 
human dysferlin-deficient patients. Collectively, this longitudinal analysis 
identifies consistent disease parameters that can be indicators of efficacy in 
studies developing treatments for human dysferlin deficiency.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) represents the 
only curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but 
involves non-negligible morbidity and mortality. Crucial questions in clinical 
decision-making include the definition of optimal timing of the procedure and 
the benefit of cytoreduction before transplant in high-risk patients. We carried 
out a decision analysis on 1728 MDS who received supportive care, 
transplantation or hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Risk assessment was based on 
the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). We used a 
continuous-time multistate Markov model to describe the natural history of 
disease and evaluate the effect of different treatment policies on survival. 
Life expectancy increased when transplantation was delayed from the initial 
stages to intermediate IPSS-R risk (gain-of-life expectancy 5.3, 4.7 and 2.8 
years for patients aged ⩽55, 60 and 65 years, respectively), and then decreased 
for higher risks. Modeling decision analysis on IPSS-R versus original IPSS 
changed transplantation policy in 29% of patients, resulting in a 2-year gain in 
life expectancy. In advanced stages, HMAs given before transplant is associated 
with a 2-year gain-of-life expectancy, especially in older patients. These 
results provide a preliminary evidence to maximize the effectiveness of allo-SCT 
in MDS.

Hair loss known as alopecia is caused by abnormal hair follicle cycling 
including shortening of the anagen (growth) phase and changing of hair follicle 
morphology with miniaturization. In accordance with the life extension, the 
quality of life is considered to be a most important thing. The yearning for 
healthy and beautiful hair and low self esteem due to hair loss had negative 
influence on the quality of life with psychosocial maladjustment. The objective 
of this research was to identify new compound that can be used as a drug to 
promote hair growth. We investigated whether the function of sinapic acid (SA) 
is able to promote hair growth in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells 
(hHFDPC). We showed that treatment of SA in hHFDPC could induce proliferation 
and the activation of Akt signaling in HFDPC. In addition, SA could stimulate 
the expressions of the several growth factors, insulin-like growth factor 1, and 
vascular endothelial growth factor for hair growth. We showed that SA led to an 
increased level of phospho-GSK-3β and β-catenin accumulation in HFDPC. Finally, 
the promoting effect of SA in hHFDPC cell growth occurred by the induction of 
cell cycle progression. These results suggest that SA could be one of the 
potential candidate compounds for the treatment of alopecia by inducing hair 
growth through triggering the expressions of growth factors via activation of 
Akt and subsequent inactivation of GSK-3β /β-catenin pathway.

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of four 
different doses (based on patients' level of cognition and activation) of a 
home-based care transitions intervention compared with usual care at 2 and 6 
months after hospital discharge to home for 126 adult patients with three or 
more chronic diseases. Health care utilization was measured, and a 
cost-effectiveness analysis was used to estimate incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years associated with each intervention arm. At 6 months, 
results from this pilot study are very promising and support cost-effectiveness 
for Group 2-low cognition/high activation, Group 3-normal cognition/low 
activation, and Group 4-normal cognition/high activation patients. However, 
Group 1-low cognition/low activation needs a more intensive treatment than what 
was provided in the intervention, because of their low cognition and activation 
levels. Our intervention strategies provided to the groups would be scalable to 
a larger patient population and across different facilities.

Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) represent a pool of cells capable of 
differentiating into mature cells of different organs and systems, promoting 
tissue maintenance and repair. Among CPCs, CD34+cells (CD34+CPCs) seem to 
predict outcome in CV disease, also in elderly people. A decline in CD34+CPCs 
was reported with advancing age. Moreover, aging is associated with a state of 
chronic inflammation, influencing life expectancy. Our purpose was to 
investigate a 10-year predictive ability of CD34+CPCs, inflammatory marker 
levels, classic CV risk factors (CVRFs), and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in a 
population of healthy, self-sufficient octogenarians. We found that baseline 
CD34+CPCs was strongly associated with mortality, showing a significant 
difference in CD34+CPC numbers between deceased and living patients. Moreover, 
by dividing our patients into tertiles based on age reached, this difference was 
more remarkable the higher the age reached. Regressive analyses suggested that 
the chances of reaching an older age depend on higher CD34+CPCs at baseline and 
are not significantly affected by inflammatory markers levels, FRS, CVFRs, or 
HDL-C levels. We found that higher CD34+CPCs predict longer life also in the 
oldest old, providing additional insights on the predictive role of CD34+CPCs in 
subjects aged 80 years or more.

The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors is comprised of a 
large, population-based cohort offering one of the best opportunities to study 
the relationship between exposure to radiation and incidence of respiratory 
cancers. Risks of lung, laryngeal and other cancers of the respiratory system 
were evaluated among 105,444 LSS subjects followed from 1958 to 2009. During 
this period, we identified 2,446 lung, 180 laryngeal and 115 other respiratory 
(trachea, mediastinum and other ill-defined sites) first primary incident cancer 
cases. Ten additional years of follow-up, improved radiation dose estimates, 
revised smoking data, and updated migration information were used to investigate 
the joint effects of radiation and smoking using Poisson regression methods. For 
nonsmokers, the sex-averaged excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) for lung 
cancer (at age 70 after radiation exposure at age 30) was estimated as 0.81 (95% 
CI: 0.51, 1.18) with a female-to-male ratio of 2.83. There was no evidence of 
curvature in the radiation dose-response relationship overall or by sex. Lung 
cancer risks increased with pack-years of smoking and decreased with time since 
quitting smoking at any level of radiation exposure. Similar to the previously 
reported study, which followed cohort members through 1999, the ERR/Gy for lung 
cancer was significantly higher for low-to-moderate smokers than for heavy 
smokers, with little evidence of any radiation-associated excess risk in heavy 
smokers. Of 2,446 lung cancer cases, 113 (5%) could be attributed to radiation 
exposure. Of the 1,165 lung cancer cases occurring among smokers, 886 (76%) 
could be attributed to smoking. While there was little evidence of a radiation 
effect for laryngeal cancer, a nonsignificantly elevated risk of other 
respiratory cancers was observed. However, significant smoking effects were 
observed for both laryngeal (ERR per 50 pack-years = 23.57; 95% CI: 8.44, 71.05) 
and other respiratory cancers (ERR per 50 pack-years = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.10, 
3.25).

With increased life expectancy, women will spend over three decades of life 
postmenopause. The menopausal transition increases susceptibility to metabolic 
diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Thus, it 
is more important than ever to develop effective hormonal treatment strategies 
to protect aging women. Understanding the role of estrogens, and their 
biological actions mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), in the regulation of 
cardiometabolic health is of paramount importance to discover novel targeted 
therapeutics. In this brief review, we provide a detailed overview of the 
literature, from basic science findings to human clinical trial evidence, 
supporting a protective role of estrogens and their receptors, specifically ERα, 
in maintenance of cardiometabolic health. In so doing, we provide a concise 
mechanistic discussion of some of the major tissue-specific roles of estrogens 
signaling through ERα. Taken together, evidence suggests that targeted, perhaps 
receptor-specific, hormonal therapies can and should be used to optimize the 
health of women as they transition through menopause, while reducing the 
undesired complications that have limited the efficacy and use of traditional 
hormone replacement interventions.

The Contribution of Drug Overdose to Educational Gradients in Life Expectancy in 
the United States, 1992-2011.

Ho JY(1).

University, Durham, NC, USA. jessica.ho@duke.edu.

Since the mid-1990s, the United States has witnessed a dramatic rise in drug 
overdose mortality. Educational gradients in life expectancy widened over the 
same period, and drug overdose likely plays a role in this widening, 
particularly for non-Hispanic whites. The contemporary drug epidemic is 
distinctive in terms of its scope, the nature of the substances involved, and 
its geographic patterning, which influence how it impacts different education 
groups. I use vital statistics and National Health Interview Survey data to 
examine the contribution of drug overdose to educational gradients in life 
expectancy from 1992-2011. I find that over this period, years of life lost due 
to drug overdose increased for all education groups and for both males and 
females. The contribution of drug overdose to educational gradients in life 
expectancy has increased over time and is greater for non-Hispanic whites than 
for the population as a whole. Drug overdose accounts for a sizable proportion 
of the increases in educational gradients in life expectancy, particularly at 
the prime adult ages (ages 30-60), where it accounts for 25 % to 100 % of the 
widening in educational gradients between 1992 and 2011. Drug overdose mortality 
has increased more rapidly for females than for males, leading to a gender 
convergence. These findings shed light on the processes driving recent changes 
in educational gradients in life expectancy and suggest that effective measures 
to address the drug overdose epidemic should take into account its differential 
burden across education groups.

Chronic subdural hematomas are one of the most common clinical entities 
encountered in today's neurosurgical practices owing to an aging population and 
continued increases in life expectancy. Although there is a role for 
conservative management, surgical drainage remains the mainstay of current 
therapy. Regardless of the technique used for hematoma drainage, there is level 
I evidence to suggest that use of closed-system drainage during the 
perioperative period significantly decreases the likelihood for hematoma 
recurrence, length of hospital stay, and mortality.

CONTEXT: As population grow older, chronic diseases are more prevalent. It leads 
to an increase of hospitalization for acute decompensation, sometimes iterative. 
Management of these patients is not always clear, and care provided is not 
always proportional to life expectancy. Making decisions in acute situations is 
not easy.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to list and describe mortality scores within a year 
following hospitalization of patients of 65 years or older.
SOURCES: Following keywords were searched in title and abstract of articles via 
an advanced search in PudMed, and by searching Mesh terms: "aged", "aged, 80 and 
over", "mortality", "prognosis", "hospitalized", "models, statistical", "acute 
geriatric ward", "frailty", "outcome".
STUDIES SELECTION: Studies published in English between 1985 and 2015 were 
selected. Last article was published in June 2015. Articles that described 
prognostic factors of mortality without a scoring system were excluded. Articles 
that focus either on patients in the Emergency Department and in Intensive Care 
Unit, or living in institution were excluded.
RESULTS: Twenty-two scores are described in 17 articles. These scores use items 
that refer to functional status, comorbidities, cognitive status and frailty. 
Scores of mortality 3 or 6 months after hospitalization are not discriminative. 
Few of the 1-year mortality prognostic score are discriminative with AUC≥0.7.
LIMITS: This review is not systematic.
CONCLUSION: Practical use of these scores might help management of these 
patients, in order to initiate appropriate reflexion and palliative care if 
necessary.

Only a small proportion of newborn infants exposed to a pathogenic microorganism 
develop overt infection. Susceptibility to infection in preterm infants and 
infants with known comorbidities has a likely multifactorial origin and can be 
often attributed to the concurrence of iatrogenic factors, environmental 
determinants, underlying pathogenic processes, and probably genetic 
predisposition. Conversely, infection occurring in otherwise healthy full-term 
newborn infants is unexplained in most cases. Microbial virulence factors and 
the unique characteristics of the neonatal immune system only partially account 
for the interindividual variability in the neonatal immune responses to 
pathogens. We here suggest that neonatal infection occurring in otherwise 
healthy infants is caused by a failure of the specific protective immunity to 
the microorganism. To explain infection in term and preterm infants, we propose 
an extension of the previously proposed model of the genetic architecture of 
infectious diseases in humans. We then focus on group B streptococcus (GBS) 
disease, the best characterized neonatal infection, and outline the potential 
molecular mechanisms underlying the selective failure of the immune responses 
against GBS. In light of the recent discoveries of pathogen-specific primary 
immunodeficiencies and of the role of anticytokine autoantibodies in increasing 
susceptibility to specific infections, we hypothesize that GBS disease occurring 
in otherwise healthy infants could reflect an immunodeficiency caused either by 
rare genetic defects in the infant or by transmitted maternal neutralizing 
antibodies. These hypotheses are consistent with available epidemiological data, 
with clinical and epidemiological observations, and with the state of the art of 
neonatal physiology and disease. Studies should now be designed to 
comprehensively search for genetic or immunological factors involved in 
susceptibility to severe neonatal infections.

Reports focusing on biomedical principlism and the role of anaesthesiologists in 
palliative care are rare. We present the case of a newborn with multiple 
craniofacial anomalies and a diagnosis of ADAM "sequence," in which surgical 
removal of placental adhesions to the dura mater and the correction of 
meningocele was not indicated due to the very short life expectancy. After 48 
hours, the odor from the placenta indicted a necrotic process, which prevented 
the parents from being close to the child and increased his isolation. Urgent 
surgery was performed, after which the newborn was transported to the ICU and 
intubated under controlled mechanical ventilation. The patient died a week 
later. The principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for 
autonomy are simultaneously an inspiratory and regulatory framework for clinical 
practice. Although only necessary procedures are defended, which suggests a 
position contrary to invasive interventions at the end of life, sometimes they 
are the best palliative measures that can be taken in cases like the one 
described here.

BACKGROUND: Residential care infrastructure, in terms of the characteristics of 
the organisation (such as proprietary status, size, and location) and the 
physical environment, have been found to directly influence resident outcomes. 
This review aimed to summarise the existing literature of economic evaluations 
of residential care infrastructure.
METHODS: A systematic review of English language articles using AgeLine, CINAHL, 
Econlit, Informit (databases in Health; Business and Law; Social Sciences), 
Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science with retrieval up to 14 December 
2015. The search strategy combined terms relating to nursing homes, economics, 
and older people. Full economic evaluations, partial economic evaluations, and 
randomised trials reporting more limited economic information, such as estimates 
of resource use or costs of interventions were included. Data was extracted 
using predefined data fields and synthesized in a narrative summary to address 
the stated review objective.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies containing an economic component were identified. None 
of the identified studies attempted to systematically link costs and outcomes in 
the form of a cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, or cost-utility analysis. There 
was a wide variation in approaches taken for valuing the outcomes associated 
with differential residential care infrastructures: 8 studies utilized various 
clinical outcomes as proxies for the quality of care provided, and 2 focused on 
resident outcomes including agitation, quality of life, and the quality of care 
interactions. Only 2 studies included residents living with dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Robust economic evidence is needed to inform aged care facility 
design. Future research should focus on identifying appropriate and meaningful 
outcome measures that can be used at a service planning level, as well as the 
broader health benefits and cost-saving potential of different organisational 
and environmental characteristics in residential care.
