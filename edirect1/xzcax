(Control 1 group aged from 40 to 79 years old) from Bama County, and 190 healthy 
controls (Control 2 group aged from 40 to 79 years old) from Nandan County 
without a family history of longevity. Statistical analysis was conducted using 
SPSS 16.0. All genotype distributions of rs584007 and rs4420638 were consistent 
with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). Significant differences were 
observed in the frequencies of the three genotypes (GG, AG, and AA) among the 
longevity and the two control groups (χ² = 11.238, p = 0.024) for rs584007. No 
significant differences were observed in the frequencies of the three genotypes 
(GG, AG, and AA) among the longevity and the two control groups (χ² = 4.587, p = 
0.318) for rs4420638. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), 
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) were not different among the three genotypes of 
rs584007 in the three groups. The levels of HDL-c for GG, AG, and AA were 
significantly different (the highest being in the longevity group), while the 
levels of TG for AA and AG genotypes (the lowest being in the longevity group) 
and the levels of LDL-c for AG were significantly different (p < 0.05) among the 
three groups for rs584007. The levels of TG and HDL-c were significantly 
different among the three rs4420638 genotypes in the longevity group. The levels 
of TC for GG, AG, and AA were significantly different in the Control 2 group, 
while the levels of TG and HDL-c for AA and AG genotypes were significantly 
different (p < 0.05) among the three groups for rs4420638. The level of HDL-c 
was highest in the longevity group for AA and AG genotypes, and the level of TG 
was highest in the Control 2 group for rs4420638. Serum lipid parameters were 
related to environmental factors, including age, gender, BMI, DBP, SBP, 
rs4420638, and rs584007. The ApoC-I polymorphism might be one of the genetic 
factors of longevity in Bama. The ApoC-I rs4420638 and rs584007 SNPs are 
associated with serum TG and HDL-c levels in the longevous population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine differences in life expectancy with 
cognitive impairment among older Mexican adults according to nativity 
(U.S.-born/foreign-born) and among immigrants, age of migration to the United 
States.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study employs 20 years of data from the 
Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly to 
estimate the proportion of life spent cognitively healthy and cognitively 
impaired prior to death among older Mexican adults residing in the southwestern 
United States. We combine age-specific mortality rates with age-specific 
prevalence of cognitive impairment, defined as a Mini-Mental Status Exam score 
of less than 21 points to calculate Sullivan-based life table models with and 
without cognitive impairment in later life.
RESULTS: Foreign-born Mexican immigrants have longer total life expectancy and 
comparable cognitive healthy life expectancy regardless of gender compared to 
U.S.-born Mexican-Americans. However, the foreign-born spend a greater number of 
years after age 65 with cognitive impairment relative to their U.S.-born 
counterparts. Furthermore, we document an advantage in life expectancy with 
cognitive impairment and proportion of years after age 65 cognitively healthy 
among mid-life immigrant men and women relative to early- and late-life 
migrants.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The relationship between nativity, age of 
migration, and life expectancy with cognitive impairment means that the 
foreign-born are in more need of support and time-intensive care in late life. 
This issue merits special attention to develop appropriate and targeted 
screening efforts that reduce cognitive decline for diverse subgroups of older 
Mexican-origin adults as they age.

University, St. Louis, Missouri.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Individual stressors of depressive symptoms in old 
age are well identified, yet little is known about the neighborhood stressors of 
depressive symptoms. Guided by the ecological extension of the Pearlin's Stress 
Process Model, this study explores the rural and urban differences in 
neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms among older adults in China.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data came from two waves of the China Health and 
Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative survey. The study 
included 6,548 older adults ages 60 and above in 2011, with follow-up in 2013. 
Predictors (individual and neighborhood characteristics) were drawn from the 
2011 baseline, and outcome, depressive symptoms, was extracted from the 2013 
wave.
RESULTS: Multilevel modeling results showed that after controlling for 
depressive symptoms at the baseline, symptoms decreased in neighborhoods where 
physical environment and social environment were better. Among rural 
respondents, neighborhood stressors stemmed mainly from the physical 
environment, whereas among urban residents, the stressors came from the social 
environment.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrated and discussed the role that 
neighborhoods may play in reducing depressive symptoms in later life. Community 
organizers and policy makers are encouraged to ameliorate community environments 
to improve mental health among older adults in China.

Sciences Fulda,Fulda,Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse and compare the cost-effectiveness of different 
interventions to reduce salt consumption.
DESIGN: A systematic review of published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and 
cost-utility analyses (CUA) was undertaken in the databases EMBASE, MEDLINE 
(PubMed), Cochrane and others until July 2016. Study selection was limited to 
CEA and CUA conducted in member countries of the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in English, German or French, without time 
limit. Outcomes measures were life years gained (LYG), disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Relevant aspects in 
modelling were analysed and compared. Quality assessments were conducted using 
the Drummond and Jefferson/British Medical Journal checklist.
SETTING: OECD member countries.
SUBJECTS: Mainly adults.
RESULTS: Fourteen CEA and CUA were included in the review which analysed 
different strategies: salt reduction or substitution in processed foods, taxes, 
labelling, awareness campaigns and targeted dietary advice. Fifty-nine out of 
sixty-two scenarios were cost-saving. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
in international dollars (Intl.$; 2015) was particularly low for taxes, a salt 
reduction by food manufacturers and labelling (303 900 Intl.$/DALY). However, 
only six studies analysed cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective and 
quality assessments showed flaws in conducting and a lack of transparency in 
reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: A population-wide salt reduction could be cost-effective in 
prevention of hypertension and CVD in OECD member countries. However, 
comparability between study results is limited due to differences in modelling, 
applied perspectives and considered data.

BACKGROUND: Survival in pancreatic cancer remains poor with curative potential 
dependent on operative resection. We reviewed national adherence to practice 
guidelines to evaluate regional variation in the treatment and survival of 
patients with pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort review of adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
using the National Cancer Data Base from 2006 to 2013. Overall survival was 
compared by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models. 
Sequential multivariate logistic regression models were generated for odds of: 
a) diagnosis in stage I/II, b) resection, and c) receipt of multimodality 
therapy, defined as operative resection plus chemotherapy with or without 
radiation. Five geographic regions of the United States were used for analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 115,952 patients were identified. At least 22% of patients 
in all stages received no treatment, with only 38.4% and 32.3% of stage I and II 
patients receiving multimodality therapy. On unadjusted analysis, the Northeast 
had the greatest survival for all stages of disease, most pronounced for stage I 
where patients lived 2 to 3 more months (log-rank P < .0001). While adjusted 
odds of early diagnosis and resection were comparable or greater across regions 
relative to the Northeast, patients who underwent resection in the Northeast 
were significantly more likely to receive multimodality therapy. Multivariate 
Cox modeling for patients receiving multimodality therapy accounted for 
differences in 3 of 4 remaining regions.
CONCLUSION: Regional variations exist in pancreatic cancer treatment and 
survival. While providing multimodality cancer-directed therapy can help 
mitigate these differences, survival with pancreatic cancer needs to be 
interpreted in the context of overall health, underlying risk factors, and life 
expectancy.

Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with poor life 
expectancy, and glioma stem cells (GSCs) are a small population of tumor cells 
existed in GBM, in which GSCs response to drive GBM recurrence, invasion and 
contribute to the anti-cancer resistance. GSCs have been identified and 
developed as a therapeutic target for GBM and can be used in drugs screening. 
Isocostunolide is a natural sesquiterpenoid and contained abundant resource in 
medicinal plants, but the anti-cancer efficacies of it against GSCs are still 
unexplored. In this investigation, the anti-tumor activity of isocostunolide 
against GSCs was investigated and the result demonstrated that it inhibited the 
growth of GSCs (GSC-3#, GSC-12#, GSC-18#) significantly with an IC50 value of 
2.80μg/ml, 2.61μg/ml, 1.07μg/ml, respectively. In further mechanism study, 
isocostunolide inhibited GSCs cell proliferation, induced GSCs apoptosis 
significantly, as well as increased the proportion of the cleavage of caspase-3. 
The result suggested that isocostunolide induced GSCs apoptosis via the caspase 
dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, isocostunolide damaged GSCs colony 
formation capacity significantly and exhibited the anti-cancer efficacy against 
GSCs in vitro.

BACKGROUND: The challenge when selecting elderly patients with colorectal cancer 
(CRC) for adjuvant therapy is to estimate the likelihood that death from other 
causes will preclude cancer events from occurring. The aim of this paper is to 
evaluate whether comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can predict survival 
and cancer-specific mortality in elderly CRC patients candidates for adjuvant 
therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-five consecutive patients aged ≥75 with 
high-risk stage II and stage III CRC were prospectively included from May 2008 
to May 2015. All patients underwent CGA, which evaluated comorbidity, 
polypharmacy, functional status, geriatric syndromes, mood, cognition, and 
social support. According to CGA results, patients were classified into three 
groups-fit, medium-fit, and unfit-to receive standard therapy, adjusted 
treatment, and best supportive care, respectively. We recorded survival and 
cause of death and used the Fine-Gray regression model to analyze competing 
causes of death.
RESULTS: Following CGA, 85 (43%) participants were classified as fit, 57 (29%) 
as medium-fit, and 53 (28%) as unfit. The univariate 5-year survival rates were 
74%, 52%, and 27%. Sixty-one (31%) patients died due to cancer progression 
(53%), non-cancer-related cause (46%), and unknown reasons (1%); there were no 
toxicity-related deaths. Fit and medium-fit participants were more likely to die 
due to cancer progression, whereas patients classified as unfit were at 
significantly greater risk of non-cancer-related death.
CONCLUSION: CGA showed efficacy in predicting survival and discriminating 
between causes of death in elderly patients with high-risk stage II and stage 
III resected CRC, with potential implications for shaping the decision-making 
process for adjuvant therapies.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adjuvant therapy in elderly patients with colorectal 
cancer is controversial due to the high risk for competing events among these 
patients. In order to effectively select older patients for adjuvant therapy, we 
have to weigh the risk of cancer-related mortality and the potential survival 
benefits with treatment against the patient's life expectancy, irrespective of 
cancer. This prospective study focused on the prognostic value of geriatric 
assessment for survival using a competing-risk analysis approach, providing an 
important contribution on the treatment decision-making process and helping 
clinicians to identify elderly patients who might benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy among those who will not.

Proteases play a pivotal role in regulating important physiological processes 
from food digestion to blood clotting. They are also important biomarkers for 
many diseases such as cancers. The importance of proteases has led to extensive 
efforts in the screening of proteases and their inhibitors as potential drug 
molecules. For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have been 
treated with HIV-1 protease inhibitors to prolong the life expectancy of 
patients. Such a close relationship between diseases and proteases provides a 
strong motivation for developing sensitive, selective, and robust protease 
assays and sensors, which can be exploited to discover new proteases and 
inhibitors. In this aspect, protease assays based on levels of proteolytic 
activities are more relevant than protease affinity assays such as immunoassays. 
In this review, recent developments of protease activity assays based on 
different detection principles are discussed and compared. For homogenous 
assays, fluorescence-based techniques are the most popular due to their high 
sensitivity and quantitative results. However, homogeneous assays have limited 
multiplex sensing capabilities. In contrast, heterogeneous assays can be 
employed to detect multiple proteases simultaneously, given the microarray 
technology that is already available. Among them, electrochemical methods, 
surface spectroscopy techniques, and enzyme-linked peptide protease assays are 
commonly used. Finally, recent developments in liquid crystal (LC)-based 
protease assays and their applications for detecting proteases and their 
inhibitors are discussed.

Agricultural intensification is a leading cause of global biodiversity loss, 
which can reduce the provisioning of ecosystem services in managed ecosystems. 
Organic farming and plant diversification are farm management schemes that may 
mitigate potential ecological harm by increasing species richness and boosting 
related ecosystem services to agroecosystems. What remains unclear is the extent 
to which farm management schemes affect biodiversity components other than 
species richness, and whether impacts differ across spatial scales and landscape 
contexts. Using a global metadataset, we quantified the effects of organic 
farming and plant diversification on abundance, local diversity (communities 
within fields), and regional diversity (communities across fields) of arthropod 
pollinators, predators, herbivores, and detritivores. Both organic farming and 
higher in-field plant diversity enhanced arthropod abundance, particularly for 
rare taxa. This resulted in increased richness but decreased evenness. While 
these responses were stronger at local relative to regional scales, richness and 
abundance increased at both scales, and richness on farms embedded in complex 
relative to simple landscapes. Overall, both organic farming and in-field plant 
diversification exerted the strongest effects on pollinators and predators, 
suggesting these management schemes can facilitate ecosystem service providers 
without augmenting herbivore (pest) populations. Our results suggest that 
organic farming and plant diversification promote diverse arthropod 
metacommunities that may provide temporal and spatial stability of ecosystem 
service provisioning. Conserving diverse plant and arthropod communities in 
farming systems therefore requires sustainable practices that operate both 
within fields and across landscapes.

Treatment decisions in elderly patients with cancer are complex. Not only the 
type and stage of the tumor, but also comorbidity, medical background and 
personal contextual factors need to be taken into account. The individual 
treatment perspective, life expectancy and quality of life are important 
determinants of the final treatment decision for the elderly cancer patient. 
Because of their longstanding relation with the elderly and their holistic 
approach we think that general practitioners should be involved, and we suggest 
that every elderly patient with cancer should have a 'time out consultation' 
with the general practitioner to prepare for the final treatment choice.

BACKGROUND: Increase in life expectancy and tooth retention in contemporary 
Australian adults may increase population-level burden of having root caries. 
This study aimed to describe patterns and evaluate associations of root caries 
with socio-demographic, socio-economic, clinical and behavioural factors.
METHODS: A secondary analysis was undertaken using data from the National Survey 
of Adult Oral Health 2004-2006, which included 5505 randomly general adults 15+ 
years old. Participants underwent an oral examination and completed an interview 
and a questionnaire. Prevalence and mean number of decayed/filled root (root 
DFS), untreated root (root DS), filled root (root FS), gingival recession, oral 
hygiene and gingival status were derived from examinations. Socio-demographic, 
socio-economic and behavioural factors were self-reported. Multivariable models 
were generated to estimate prevalence ratios (PR), mean ratios (MR) and 
confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for number of surfaces with gingival 
recession. Additional analysis for older adults 60+ years old was presented.
RESULTS: The prevalence of root caries was 25.3% (CI=23.6-27.1) and 62.0% 
[CI=58.7-65.1] among general and older adults, respectively. Risk factors found 
were similar in both populations. Smokers had higher prevalence and mean number 
of root DFS, DS and FS than never-smokers. In contrast with poor oral hygiene, 
high income and frequent brushing were significantly associated with lower mean 
root DS. Frequent dental visiting was associated with higher root FS and DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Root caries affected about a quarter of Australian general adults 
and more than a half of older adults. People who were smokers presented a 
significantly higher prevalence and severity of root caries.

Mutations in FAT4 gene, one of the human FAT family genes, have been identified 
in Van Maldergem syndrome (VMS) and Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema 
syndrome (HS). The FAT4 gene encodes a large protein with extracellular cadherin 
repeats, EGF-like domains and Laminin G-like domains. FAT4 plays a role in tumor 
suppression and planar cell polarity. Drosophila contains a human FAT4 
homologue, fat. Drosophila fat has been mainly studied with Drosophila eye and 
wing systems. Here, we specially knocked down Drosophila fat in nerve system. 
Neuron-specific knockdown of fat shortened the life span and induced the defect 
in locomotive abilities of adult flies. In consistent with these phenotypes, 
defects in synapse structure at neuromuscular junction were observed in 
neuron-specific fat-knockdown flies. In addition, aberrations in axonal 
targeting of photoreceptor neuron in third-instar larvae were also observed, 
suggesting that fat involves in axonal targeting. Taken together, the results 
indicate that Drosophila fat plays an essential role in formation and/or 
maintenance of neuron. Both VMS and HS show mental retardation and neuronal 
defects. We therefore consider that these two rare human diseases could possibly 
be caused by the defect in FAT4 function in neuronal cells.

[Is dementia preventable through intensive vascular care? The preDIVA trial].

[Article in Dutch]

(1)* Dit onderzoek werd eerder gepubliceerd in de Lancet (2016;388:797-805) met 
als titel 'Effectiveness of a 6-year multidomain vascular care intervention to 
prevent dementia (preDIVA): a cluster-randomised controlled trial.' Afgedrukt 
met toestemming.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether intensive vascular care in GP practices can prevent 
dementia in a population of community-dwelling older people.
METHOD: This pragmatic cluster-randomised open-label study (ISRCTN29711771) was 
conducted in persons aged 70-78 years who were registered with Dutch GP 
practices. The only exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of dementia and limited 
life expectancy. Practices were randomly assigned to an intervention arm or a 
control arm. Participants in the interventional arm underwent a cardiovascular 
check-up every 4 months for six years by a practice nurse. Primary outcomes were 
cumulative incidence of dementia and functional limitations. Main secondary 
outcomes were the incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality.
RESULTS: Between June 2006 and March 2009, 116 GP practices (3526 participants) 
were recruited and randomly assigned: 63 (1890 participants) to the intervention 
group and 53 (1636 participants) to the control group. Primary outcome data were 
obtained for 3454 (98%) participants; median follow-up was 6.7 years. In this 
period, dementia was diagnosed in 121/1853 (6.5%) participants in the 
intervention group and in 112/1601 (7.0%) participants in the control group. 
This difference was not significant (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.19). No 
differences were found with regard to functional decline, incident 
cardiovascular disease and mortality.
CONCLUSION: Long-term intensive vascular care for community-dwelling elderly 
patients, provided in a primary care setting, does not result in a reduced 
incidence of dementia, functional limitations or mortality. There is, however, 
possibly an effect in elderly patients with untreated or sub-optimally treated 
hypertension; this warrants further research.

[The effects of severe and very severe injuries].

[Article in Dutch]

- The effects of severe injuries can be charted using the International 
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model and the burden 
of disease model, in which the burden of disease is expressed in 
'disability-adjusted life years' (DALYs). - Severe accidents cause 10 DALYs per 
1000 people, which is comparable with the burden of disease of mood disorders 
and lung cancer.- In the Netherlands, severe injury victims are often males aged 
< 40 years, who are often injured in road traffic accidents. - The average 
hospital stay after a severe injury is one month, after which almost 75% of the 
patients are discharged home, while one quarter subsequently stay in 
rehabilitation facilities for 3-6 months. More than half return to their 
original employment. - Patients with thoracic and abdominal injuries recover 
relatively well, whereas injuries of the lower extremities, brain and spinal 
cord give a relatively poor prognosis. Comorbidity increases the chance of a 
less good recovery. Older people who survive an accident recover relatively 
well.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has traditionally had a low life expectancy due to the 
onslaught of the HIV epidemic, high levels of chronic diseases, injuries, 
conflict and undernutrition. Therefore, research into public health concerns of 
older persons has largely been overlooked. With a growing population, the 
roll-out of antiretroviral treatment, and the effects of globalisation, SSA is 
experiencing an increase in the number of people over 50 years of age as well as 
an increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD). The aim of 
this review is to highlight available research on the health status of older 
persons in SSA, and to identify the current gaps that warrant further 
investigation. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases to 
identify studies in SSA on older persons (aged 50 years and older) related to 
health indicators including nutritional status, NCD and HIV burden. While it was 
concluded that older persons are at an increased risk of poor health, it was 
also determined that significant gaps exist in this particular area of research; 
namely nutrient deficiency prevalence. Resources should be directed towards 
identifying the health concerns of older persons and developing appropriate 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem, 
determining the reduction in life expectancy and an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease.
METHOD: An observational, cohort, retrospective, based on patient's medical 
records data with CKD under hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney 
transplantation in the city of Curitiba, in the period from January to June 
2014, evacuativo the financial impact on the Unified Health System (SUS) and the 
supplementary health.
RESULTS: The lowest cost of a kidney transplant in the first year was R$ 
40,743.03 when cyclosporine was used and the highest was R$ 48,388.17 with the 
use of tacrolimus. In the second year post-transplant, hemodialysis and 
peritoneal dialysis have a higher cost compared to kidney transplant. 
Transplantation with deceased donor, treated with tacrolimus: R$ 67,023.39; 
Hemodialysis R$ 71,717.51 and automated peritoneal dialysis automatic R$ 
69,527.03.
CONCLUSIONS: After the first two years of renal replacement therapy, 
transplantation demonstrates lower costs to the system when compared to other 
modalities evaluated. Based on that, this therapy justifies improvements in 
government policies in this sector.

Current Concepts of Transition of Care in Cystic Fibrosis.

Patel A, Dowell M, Giles BL.

Over the past 6 decades, advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis and 
management have extended the life expectancy of patients far beyond childhood; 
therefore, all pediatric CF patients must prepare for transition to adult care. 
Readiness assessment, knowledge and skill education, and support structures are 
all elements of ideal transition. Transition should begin early in life with 
teaching skills and knowledge for disease care, and in adolescence the readiness 
to transition should be addressed. Transition is a gradual process of increasing 
responsibilities in self-care and disease management, an improvement in the 
understanding of CF, and an iterative process of self-assessment with knowledge 
acquisition. Communication and collaboration between pediatric and adult 
providers is necessary to ensure a smooth and successful transition with minimum 
effect on outcomes. Although there is increased knowledge of successful 
transition practices, this area presents many opportunities for advancement of 
care for the patient with CF. [Pediatr Ann. 2017;46(5):e188-e192.].

{en} Over the past decades, much research has focused on understanding the 
critical factors for marine extinctions with the aim of preventing further 
species losses in the oceans. Although conservation and management strategies 
are enabling several species and populations to recover, others remain at low 
abundance levels or continue to decline. To understand these discrepancies, we 
used a published database on abundance trends of 137 populations of marine 
mammals worldwide and compiled data on 28 potentially critical factors for 
recovery. We then applied random forests and additive mixed models to determine 
which intrinsic and extrinsic factors are critical for the recovery of marine 
mammals. A mix of life-history characteristics, ecological traits, phylogenetic 
relatedness, population size, geographic range, human impacts, and management 
efforts explained why populations recovered or not. Consistently, species with 
lower age at maturity and intermediate habitat area were more likely to recover, 
which is consistent with life-history and ecological theory. Body size, trophic 
level, social interactions, dominant habitat, ocean basin, and habitat 
disturbance also explained some differences in recovery patterns. Overall, a 
variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors were important for species' recovery, 
pointing to cumulative effects. Our results provide insight for improving 
conservation and management strategies to enhance recoveries in the future.

BACKGROUND: The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether 
dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 
analogues are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in 
people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues on the 
prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with 
impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated 
glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; 
MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the reference lists of 
systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked 
investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. 
The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a 
duration of 12 weeks or more comparing DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues with 
any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing 
intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting 
glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations 
of these.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and 
full-text articles and records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data 
independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second 
review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a 
third review author. For meta-analyses, we planned to use a random-effects model 
with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean 
differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the 
GRADE instrument.
MAIN RESULTS: We included seven completed RCTs; about 98 participants were 
randomised to a DPP-4 inhibitor as monotherapy and 1620 participants were 
randomised to a GLP-1 analogue as monotherapy. Two trials investigated a DPP-4 
inhibitor and five trials investigated a GLP-1 analogue. A total of 924 
participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a 
comparator group; 889 participants were randomised to placebo and 33 
participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of liraglutide contributed 85% of 
all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from 12 weeks to 160 
weeks. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk 
of bias' domains and did not perform meta-analyses because there were not enough 
trials.One trial comparing the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin with placebo 
reported no deaths (very low-quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM by means 
of WHO diagnostic criteria in this trial was 3/90 participants randomised to 
vildagliptin versus 1/89 participants randomised to placebo (very low-quality 
evidence). Also, 1/90 participants on vildagliptin versus 2/89 participants on 
placebo experienced a serious adverse event (very low-quality evidence). One out 
of 90 participants experienced congestive heart failure in the vildagliptin 
group versus none in the placebo group (very low-quality evidence). There were 
no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, health-related quality of 
life or socioeconomic effects reported.All-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
following treatment with GLP-1 analogues were rarely reported; one trial of 
exenatide reported that no participant died. Another trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg 
showed that 2/1501 in the liraglutide group versus 2/747 in the placebo group 
died after 160 weeks of treatment (very low-quality evidence).The incidence of 
T2DM following treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo after 160 
weeks was 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide versus 46/738 
(6.2%) participants randomised to placebo (very low-quality evidence). The trial 
established the risk for (diagnosis of) T2DM as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% (6.5% or 
greater), fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or greater to 6.9 mmol/L or less 
(7.0 mmol/L or greater) or two-hour post-load plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L or 
greater to 11.0 mmol/L (11.1 mmol/L). Altogether, 70/1472 (66%) participants 
regressed from intermediate hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia compared with 
268/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group. The incidence of T2DM after the 
12-week off-treatment extension period (i.e. after 172 weeks) showed that five 
additional participants were diagnosed T2DM in the liraglutide group, compared 
with one participant in the placebo group. After 12-week treatment cessation, 
740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) 
participants in the placebo group had normoglycaemia.One trial used exenatide 
and 2/17 participants randomised to exenatide versus 1/16 participants 
randomised to placebo developed T2DM (very low-quality evidence). This trial did 
not provide a definition of T2DM. One trial reported serious adverse events in 
230/1524 (15.1%) participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm versus 96/755 
(12.7%) participants in the placebo arm (very low quality evidence). There were 
no serious adverse events in the trial using exenatide. Non-fatal myocardial 
infarction was reported in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 
0/55 participants in the placebo arm at 172 weeks (very low-quality evidence). 
One trial reported congestive heart failure in 1/1524 participants in the 
liraglutide arm and in 1/755 participants in the placebo arm (very low-quality 
evidence). Participants receiving liraglutide compared with placebo had a small 
mean improvement in the physical component of the 36-item Short Form scale 
showing a difference of 0.87 points (95% CI 0.17 to 1.58; P = 0.02; 1 trial; 
1791 participants; very low-quality evidence). No trial evaluating 
GLP-1-analogues reported data on stroke, microvascular complications or 
socioeconomic effects.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no firm evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 
analogues compared mainly with placebo substantially influence the risk of T2DM 
and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk for the 
development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient-important outcomes.
