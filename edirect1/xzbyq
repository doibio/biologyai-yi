INTRODUCTION: Mapping algorithms are increasingly being used to predict 
health-utility values based on responses or scores from non-preference-based 
measures, thereby informing economic evaluations.
OBJECTIVES: We explored whether predictions in the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level 
instrument (EQ-5D-3L) health-utility gains from mapping algorithms might differ 
if estimated using differenced versus raw scores, using the Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), a widely used health status measure for low back 
pain, as an example.
METHODS: We estimated algorithms mapping within-person changes in RMQ scores to 
changes in EQ-5D-3L health utilities using data from two clinical trials with 
repeated observations. We also used logistic regression models to estimate 
response mapping algorithms from these data to predict within-person changes in 
responses to each EQ-5D-3L dimension from changes in RMQ scores. Predicted 
health-utility gains from these mappings were compared with predictions based on 
raw RMQ data.
RESULTS: Using differenced scores reduced the predicted health-utility gain from 
a unit decrease in RMQ score from 0.037 (standard error [SE] 0.001) to 0.020 (SE 
0.002). Analysis of response mapping data suggests that the use of differenced 
data reduces the predicted impact of reducing RMQ scores across EQ-5D-3L 
dimensions and that patients can experience health-utility gains on the EQ-5D-3L 
'usual activity' dimension independent from improvements captured by the RMQ.
CONCLUSION: Mappings based on raw RMQ data overestimate the EQ-5D-3L health 
utility gains from interventions that reduce RMQ scores. Where possible, mapping 
algorithms should reflect within-person changes in health outcome and be 
estimated from datasets containing repeated observations if they are to be used 
to estimate incremental health-utility gains.

Life Data to Inform Trial-Based Economic Evaluations of Interventions Within 
Emergency and Critical Care Settings: A Systematic Literature Review.

BACKGROUND: Trial-based cost-utility analyses require health-related quality of 
life data that generate utility values in order to express health outcomes in 
terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Assessments of baseline 
health-related quality of life are problematic where trial participants are 
incapacitated or critically ill at the time of randomisation. This review aims 
to identify and critique methods for handling non-availability of baseline 
health-related quality of life data in trial-based cost-utility analyses within 
emergency and critical illness settings.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted, following PRISMA 
guidelines, to identify trial-based cost-utility analyses of interventions 
within emergency and critical care settings. Databases searched included the 
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Journals Library (1991-July 2016), 
Cochrane Library (all years); National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation 
Database (all years) and Ovid MEDLINE/Embase (without time restriction). 
Strategies employed to handle non-availability of baseline health-related 
quality of life data in final QALY estimations were identified and critiqued.
RESULTS: A total of 4224 published reports were screened, 19 of which met the 
study inclusion criteria (mean trial size 1670): 14 (74 %) from the UK, four 
(21%) from other European countries and one (5%) from India. Twelve studies 
(63%) were based in emergency departments and seven (37%) in intensive care 
units. Only one study was able to elicit patient-reported health-related quality 
of life at baseline. To overcome the lack of baseline data when estimating 
QALYs, eight studies (42%) assigned a fixed utility weight corresponding to 
either death, an unconscious health state or a country-specific norm to patients 
at baseline, four (21%) ignored baseline utilities, three (16%) applied values 
from another study, one (5%) generated utility values via retrospective recall 
and one (5%) elicited utilities from experts. A preliminary exploration of these 
methods shows that incremental QALY estimation is unlikely to be biased if 
balanced trial allocation is achieved and subsequent collection of 
health-related quality of life data occurs at the earliest possible opportunity 
following commencement of treatment, followed by an adequate number of follow-up 
assessments.
CONCLUSION: Trial-based cost-utility analyses within emergency and critical 
illness settings have applied different methods for QALY estimation, employing 
disparate assumptions about the health-related quality of life of patients at 
baseline. Where baseline measurement is not practical, measurement at the 
earliest opportunity following commencement of treatment should minimise bias in 
QALY estimation.

BACKGROUND: Patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are a 
priority group for intensified therapy without weight gain and with low risk of 
hypoglycaemia.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of insulin degludec plus 
liraglutide (IDegLira, Xultophy®) compared with six potential intensification 
treatment options for patients with T2DM that is uncontrolled with basal 
insulin.
METHODS: The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE) Cohort Model of Type 2 
Diabetes was used with Swedish input data, a 40-year time frame and a societal 
perspective. The comparators for treatment intensification included insulin 
glargine, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, insulin aspart plus either 
glargine or NPH, and liraglutide plus either glargine or NPH. Clinical data for 
all comparators (except NPH insulin) were based on an indirect treatment 
comparison of several studies. Prices were obtained from the 2014 Swedish Dental 
and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket 
[TLV]) database, and utility values were obtained from published studies. 
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken.
RESULTS: Overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were Swedish krona 
(SEK) 70,000 or lower per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). IDegLira compared 
with intensified basal insulin showed an ICER of SEK 28,000 per QALY versus 
insulin glargine, SEK70,000 per QALY versus NPH insulin and SEK 60,000 per QALY 
versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. IDegLira was dominant over insulin glargine 
plus liraglutide and insulin aspart plus insulin glargine or NPH insulin. 
Results were driven by the difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction 
between treatments, as confirmed by sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira is estimated to be a cost-effective treatment in Sweden 
compared with commonly used intensification treatments for patients with T2DM 
uncontrolled with basal insulin.

Ultraviolet (UV) exposure has an array of damaging effects and is the main cause 
of skin cancer in humans. Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), including basal cell 
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common type of cancer. 
Incidence of NMSC has increased due to greater UV radiation, increased life 
expectancy and other changes in lifestyle; the annual cost of skin cancer 
treatment in the United States has increased concurrently to around eight 
billion dollars. Because of these trends, novel approaches to skin cancer 
prevention have become an important area of research to decrease skin cancer 
morbidity and defray the costs associated with treatment. Chemoprevention aims 
to prevent or delay the development of skin cancer through the use of 
phytochemicals. Use of phytochemicals as chemopreventive agents has gained 
attention due to their low toxicity and anticarcinogenic properties. 
Phytochemicals also exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative 
effects which support their use as chemopreventive agents, particularly for skin 
cancer. Preclinical and human studies have shown that phytochemicals decrease 
UV-induced skin damage and photocarcinogenesis. In this review article, we 
discuss the selected phytochemicals that may prevent or delay UV-induced 
carcinogenesis and highlight their potential use for skin protection.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify subgroups of patients on 
the basis of their activity patterns and to investigate their relationship with 
life goals, optimism, affect, and functioning. The sample was comprised of 276 
patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Hierarchical cluster analysis was 
performed on the activity pattern variables and the resulting clusters were 
compared using 1-way analysis of variance. The 4-cluster was the optimal 
solution. The 4 clusters comprised: 1) avoiders: patients with high levels of 
avoidance and low levels of persistence, who use pacing to reduce pain, 2) 
doers: patients with high levels of persistence and low levels of pacing and 
avoidance, 3) extreme cyclers: patients with high levels of avoidance and 
persistence and low levels of pacing, and 4) medium cyclers: patients with 
moderately high levels of avoidance and persistence and high levels of pacing. 
Comparison of the clusters showed that doers had the most adaptive profile, 
whereas avoiders, followed by extreme cyclers, had unhealthy profiles. Doers 
showed a high level of optimism and a good balance between goal value, 
expectancy, and conflict.
PERSPECTIVE: It is useful to distinguish profiles on the basis of various 
activity patterns. In contrast to profiles characterized by avoidance, profiles 
characterized by high persistence and low avoidance were associated with 
adaptive results. Patients with this profile also showed a high level of 
optimism and a good balance between goal value, expectancy, and conflict.

Arteriovenous Grafts: Much Maligned But in Need of Reconsideration?

Allon M(1).

Author information:

Alabama.

There are substantial variations in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) use among 
hemodialysis patients in different countries, in different regions of the U.S., 
and even in different hemodialysis units within a single metropolitan area. 
These variations persist after adjustment for patient demographics and 
comorbidities, suggesting that practice patterns play a major role in 
determining the frequency of AVF use. These observations led to vascular access 
guidelines urging nephrologists and surgeons to increase AVF creation in 
patients with chronic kidney disease. Over the past 20 years, as clinicians have 
adopted these guidelines, the prevalence of AVF use in hemodialysis patients has 
increased substantially. At the same time, clinicians have recognized important 
limitations of an unwavering "Fistula First" approach. First, a substantial 
proportion of AVFs fail to mature even when routine preoperative vascular 
mapping is used, leading to prolonged catheter dependence. Second, certain 
patient subgroups are at high risk for AVF nonmaturation. Third, nonmaturing 
AVFs frequently require interventions to promote their maturation. Fourth, AVFs 
that require such interventions have shortened cumulative patency. Fifth, 
arteriovenous grafts (AVG) have several advantages over AVFs, including lower 
primary failure rates, fewer interventions prior to successful cannulation, and 
shorter duration of catheter dependence with its associated risk of bacteremia. 
All these observations have led nephrologists to propose an individualized 
approach to vascular access, with AVG being preferred in patients who initiate 
hemodialysis with a catheter, particularly if they are at high risk for AVF 
nonmaturation and have a relatively short life expectancy.

Despite advances in predialysis care and dialysis technology, patients with 
advanced chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease continue to 
experience multiple comorbidities, a high symptom burden, a shortened life 
expectancy, and substantial physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering. 
Patients with acute kidney injury and end-stage renal disease, especially if 
they are older, often undergo prolonged hospitalizations, greater use of 
intensive medical treatment, and limited survival. Unfortunately, most 
nephrologists are not trained to conduct shared decision-making conversations to 
elicit patients' values, preferences, and goals for treatment and address their 
patients' multifactorial suffering. These patients would benefit from the 
integration of supportive care principles into their care. This article 
addresses how supportive care specialists can collaborate with nephrology 
clinicians to provide patient-centered supportive care and identifies resources 
to assist them in this endeavor.

BACKGROUND: Severe obesity in adolescence is associated with reduced life 
expectancy and impaired quality of life. Long-term benefits of conservative 
treatments in adolescents are known to be modest, whereas short-term outcomes of 
adolescent bariatric surgery are promising. We aimed to compare 5-year outcomes 
of adolescent surgical patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with those of 
conservatively treated adolescents and of adults undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass, in the Adolescent Morbid Obesity Surgery (AMOS) study.
METHODS: We did a nationwide, prospective, non-randomised controlled study of 
adolescents (aged 13-18 years) with severe obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass at three specialised paediatric obesity treatment centres in Sweden. We 
compared clinical outcomes in adolescent surgical patients with those of matched 
adolescent controls undergoing conservative treatment and of adult controls 
undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The primary outcome measure was change in 
BMI over 5 years. We used multilevel mixed-effect regression models to assess 
longitudinal changes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00289705.
FINDINGS: Between April, 2006, and May, 2009, 100 adolescents were recruited to 
the study, of whom 81 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (mean age 16·5 years 
[SD 1·2], bodyweight 132·8 kg [22·1], and BMI 45·5 kg/m2 [SD 6·1]). 80 matched 
adolescent controls and 81 matched adult controls were enrolled for comparison 
of outcomes. The change in bodyweight in adolescent surgical patients over 5 
years was -36·8 kg (95% CI -40·9 to -32·8), resulting in a reduction in BMI of 
-13·1 kg/m2 (95% CI -14·5 to -11·8), although weight loss less than 10% occurred 
in nine (11%). Mean BMI rose in adolescent controls (3·3 kg/m2, 95% CI 1·1-4·8) 
over the 5-year study period, whereas the BMI change in adult controls was 
similar to that in adolescent surgical patients (mean change -12·3 kg/m2, 95% CI 
-13·7 to -10·9). Comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors in adolescent 
surgical patients showed improvement over 5 years and compared favourably with 
those in adolescent controls. 20 (25%) of 81 adolescent surgical patients 
underwent additional abdominal surgery for complications of surgery or rapid 
weight loss and 58 (72%) showed some type of nutritional deficiency; health-care 
consumption (hospital attendances and admissions) was higher in adolescent 
surgical patients compared with adolescent controls. 20 (25%) of 81 adolescent 
controls underwent bariatric surgery during the 5-year follow-up.
INTERPRETATION: Adolescents with severe obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass had substantial weight loss over 5 years, alongside improvements in 
comorbidities and risk factors. However, gastric bypass was associated with 
additional surgical interventions and nutritional deficiencies. Conventional 
non-surgical treatment was associated with weight gain and a quarter of patients 
had bariatric surgery within 5 years.

Interventional bronchoscopy has a predominant role in the management of both 
early and advanced-stage airway tumors. Given the very poor prognosis of lung 
cancer, there is a need for new tools to improve early detection and 
bronchoscopic treatment of endo-bronchial precancerous lesions. In more advanced 
stages, interventional bronchoscopy plays an important role, as nearly a third 
of lung cancers lead to proximal airway obstruction. This will cause great 
discomfort or even life-threatening symptoms related to local extension, such as 
dyspnea, post-obstructive pneumonia, and hemoptysis. Surgery for very locally 
advanced disease is only effective for a limited number of patients and the 
effects of conventional antitumor therapies, like radiation therapy or 
chemotherapy, are inconstant and are too delayed in a palliative context. In 
this review, we aim to provide pulmonologists with an exhaustive technical 
overview of (I) the bronchoscopic management of benign endobronchial lesions; 
(II) the bronchoscopic management of malignant tumors, including the curative 
treatment of localized lesions and palliative management of malignant proximal 
airway stenosis; and (III) descriptions of the emerging endoscopic techniques 
used to treat peripheral lung tumors.

Autophagy is the major intracellular degradation system by which cytoplasmic 
materials are delivered to and degraded in the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic 
cells. MoAtg14 in M. oryzae, a hitherto uncharacterized protein, is the highly 
divergent homolog of the yeast Atg14 and the mammal BARKOR. The MoATG14 deletion 
mutant exhibited collapse in the center of the colonies, poor conidiation and a 
complete loss of virulence. Significantly, the ΔMoatg14 mutant showed delayed 
breakdown of glycogen, less lipid bodies, reduced turgor pressure in the 
appressorium and impaired conidial autophagic cell death. The autophagic process 
was blocked in the ΔMoatg14 mutant, and the autophagic degradation of the marker 
protein GFP-MoAtg8 was interrupted. GFP-MoAtg14 co-localized with mCherry-MoAtg8 
in the aerial hypha. In addition, a conserved coiled-coil domain was predicted 
in the N-terminal region of the MoAtg14 protein, a domain which could mediate 
the interaction between MoAtg14 and MoAtg6. The coiled-coil domain of the 
MoAtg14 protein is essential for its function in autophagy and pathogenicity.

BACKGROUND: Innervated free muscle transfer using the gracilis muscle or 
temporalis myoplasty has been successfully utilized for facial reanimation in 
chronic facial palsy. These techniques are less suited to immediate facial 
reconstruction in the setting of radical parotidectomy, in which the complexity 
of the defect, patient age, postoperative radiotherapy, and limited life 
expectancy pose particular challenges.
METHODS: We present a novel description of the use of a chimeric anterolateral 
thigh (ALT) flap and innervated vastus lateralis to achieve midface static 
suspension and dynamic reanimation in the setting of radical parotidectomy.
RESULTS: The technique is described in detail along with a video demonstrating 
the early and medium-term results in an example case.
CONCLUSION: Although outcomes using the vastus lateralis free flap for midface 
reanimation need to be objectively determined, the flap adds the potential of 
dynamic midface movement in patients undergoing radical parotidectomy who would 
otherwise not be afforded this opportunity. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head

In the clinical setting, previous studies have shown personalized risk 
assessment and communication improves risk perception and motivation. We 
evaluated an online health calculator that estimated and presented six different 
measures of life expectancy/mortality based on a person's sociodemographic and 
health behavior profile. Immediately after receiving calculator results, 
participants were invited to complete an online survey that asked how 
informative and motivating they found each risk measure, whether they would 
share their results and whether the calculator provided information they need to 
make lifestyle changes. Over 80% of the 317 survey respondents found at least 
one of six healthy living measures highly informative and motivating, but there 
was moderate heterogeneity regarding which measures respondents found most 
informative and motivating. Overall, health age was most informative and life 
expectancy most motivating. Approximately 40% of respondents would share the 
results with their clinician (44%) or social networks (38%), although the 
information they would share was often different from what they found 
informative or motivational. Online personalized risk assessment allows for a 
more personalized communication compared to historic paper-based risk assessment 
to maximize knowledge and motivation, and people should be provided a range of 
risk communication measures that reflect different risk perspectives.

PURPOSE: Surgery combined with radiation therapy (RT) is the cornerstone of 
multidisciplinary management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Although RT 
can be given in either the preoperative or the postoperative setting with 
similar local recurrence and survival outcomes, the side effect profiles, costs, 
and long-term functional outcomes are different. The aim of this study was to 
use decision analysis to determine optimal sequencing of RT with surgery in 
patients with extremity STS.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a state 
transition Markov model, with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the primary 
outcome. A time horizon of 5 years, a cycle length of 3 months, and a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY was used. One-way deterministic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the thresholds at which each 
strategy would be preferred. The robustness of the model was assessed by 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Preoperative RT is a more cost-effective strategy ($26,633/3.00 QALYs) 
than postoperative RT ($28,028/2.86 QALYs) in our base case scenario. 
Preoperative RT is the superior strategy with either 3-dimensional conformal RT 
or intensity-modulated RT. One-way sensitivity analyses identified the relative 
risk of chronic adverse events as having the greatest influence on the preferred 
timing of RT. The likelihood of preoperative RT being the preferred strategy was 
82% on probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative RT is more cost effective than postoperative RT in the 
management of resectable extremity STS, primarily because of the higher 
incidence of chronic adverse events with RT in the postoperative setting.

Antiretroviral therapy has revolutionized the care of people with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by reducing morbidity and mortality from acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome-related conditions. Despite longer life expectancy, 
however, HIV-infected individuals continue to have a higher risk of death 
compared with the general population. This has been attributed to the increasing 
incidence of noncommunicable diseases, in particular, atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular diseases. This is driven, in part, by the emergence of metabolic 
disorders, particularly dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and lipodystrophy, in 
those on antiretroviral therapy. The pathogenesis of these metabolic 
derangements is complex and multifactorial, and could be a consequence of an 
interplay between traditional age-related risk factors, HIV infection, 
antiretroviral therapy effects, and the inflammatory state and immune activation 
in this population. Understanding the contributions of each of these factors 
could not just impact the current management of these individuals and help 
mitigate the risk for premature cardiovascular disease, but also shape the 
future direction of research in HIV.

Undesired physiological instability of nanocarriers and premature drug leakage 
during blood circulation result in compromised therapeutic efficacy and severe 
side effects, which have significantly impeded the development of nanomedicine. 
Facile crosslinking of drug-loaded nanocarriers while keeping the potency of 
site-specific degradation and drug release has emerged as a viable strategy to 
overcome these drawbacks. Additionally, combination therapy has already shown 
advantages in inhibiting advanced tumors and life extension than single drug 
therapy. Herein, three kinds of diselenide-rich polymers were fabricated with 
distinct hydrophobic side chains. The component effect was interrogated to 
screen out PEG-b-PBSe diblock copolymer due to its favorable self-assembly 
controllability and high drug loading of camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin 
(DOX) that had synergistic antitumor property. Facile visible light-induced 
diselenide metathesis and regeneration was employed to crosslink nanocarriers 
for the first time. The dual drug-loaded crosslinked micelles (CPT/DOX-CCM) were 
stable in physiological conditions with minimal drug leakage, possessing 
extended blood circulation, whereas hand-in-hand dual drug release was 
significantly accelerated in tumor's redox microenvironments. In vitro 
cytotoxicity evaluation and in vivo tumor suppression with low dosage drugs 
further demonstrated the favorable potency of the redox-responsive nanoplatform 
in tumor combination chemotherapy.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2017 Feb 11;389(10069):576-578.

BACKGROUND: Indolent systemic mastocytosis, including the subvariant of 
smouldering systemic mastocytosis, is a lifelong condition associated with 
reduced quality of life. Masitinib inhibits KIT and LYN kinases that are 
involved in indolent systemic mastocytosis pathogenesis. We aimed to assess 
safety and efficacy of masitinib versus placebo in severely symptomatic patients 
who were unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatments.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we 
enrolled adults (aged 18-75 years) with indolent or smouldering systemic 
mastocytosis, according to WHO classification or documented mastocytosis based 
on histological criteria, at 50 centres in 15 countries. We excluded patients 
with cutaneous or non-severe systemic mastocytosis after a protocol amendment. 
Patients were centrally randomised (1:1) to receive either oral masitinib (6 
mg/kg per day over 24 weeks with possible extension) or matched placebo with 
minimisation according to severe symptoms. The primary endpoint was cumulative 
response (≥75% improvement from baseline within weeks 8-24) in at least one 
severe baseline symptom from the following: pruritus score of 9 or more, eight 
or more flushes per week, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression of 19 or more, or 
Fatigue Impact Scale of 75 or more. We assessed treatment effect using repeated 
measures methodology for rare diseases via the generalised estimating equation 
model in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all participants 
assigned to treatment minus those who withdrew due to a non-treatment-related 
cause. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00814073.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 19, 2009, and July 15, 2015, 135 patients were randomly 
assigned to masitinib (n=71) or placebo (n=64). By 24 weeks, masitinib was 
associated with a cumulative response of 18·7% in the primary endpoint (122·6 
responses of 656·5 possible responses [weighted generalised estimating 
equation]) compared with 7·4% for placebo (48·9 of 656·5; difference 11·3%; odds 
ratio 3·6; 95% CI 1·2-10·8; p=0·0076). Frequent severe adverse events (>4% 
difference from placebo) were diarrhoea (eight [11%] of 70 in the masitinib 
group vs one [2%] of 63 in the placebo group), rash (four [6%] vs none), and 
asthenia (four [6%] vs one [2%]). The most frequent serious adverse events were 
diarrhoea (three patients [4%] vs one [2%]) and urticaria (two [3%] vs none), 
and no life-threatening toxicities occurred. One patient in the placebo group 
died (unrelated to study treatment).
INTERPRETATION: These study findings indicate that masitinib is an effective and 
well tolerated agent for the treatment of severely symptomatic indolent or 
smouldering systemic mastocytosis.

OBJECTIVES: To project the number of people aged 45-64 years with lost 
productive life years (PLYs) due to diabetes and related costs (lost income, 
extra welfare payments, lost taxation revenue); and lost gross domestic product 
(GDP) attributable to diabetes in Australia from 2015 to 2030.
DESIGN: A simulation study of how the number of people aged 45-64 years with 
diabetes increases over time (based on population growth and disease trend data) 
and the economic losses incurred by individuals and the government. 
Cross-sectional outputs of a microsimulation model (Health&WealthMOD2030) which 
used the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Survey of Disability, Ageing and 
Carers 2003 and 2009 as a base population and integrated outputs from two 
microsimulation models (Static Incomes Model and Australian Population and 
Policy Simulation Model), Treasury's population and labour force projections, 
and chronic disease trends data.
SETTING: Australian population aged 45-64 years in 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Lost PLYs, lost income, extra welfare payments, lost taxation 
revenue, lost GDP.
RESULTS: 18 100 people are out of the labour force due to diabetes in 2015, 
increasing to 21 400 in 2030 (18% increase). National costs consisted of a loss 
of $A467 million in annual income in 2015, increasing to $A807 million in 2030 
(73% increase). For the government, extra annual welfare payments increased from 
$A311 million in 2015 to $A350 million in 2030 (13% increase); and lost annual 
taxation revenue increased from $A102 million in 2015 to $A166 million in 2030 
(63% increase). A loss of $A2.1 billion in GDP was projected for 2015, 
increasing to $A2.9 billion in 2030 attributable to diabetes through its impact 
on PLYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals incur significant costs of diabetes through lost PLYs 
and lost income in addition to disease burden through human suffering and 
healthcare costs. The government incurs extra welfare payments, lost taxation 
revenue and lost GDP, along with direct healthcare costs.

OBJECTIVES: Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M) is a priority for 
healthcare systems. We estimated the cost-effectiveness compared with standard 
care of a structured education programme (Let's Prevent) targeting lifestyle and 
behaviour change to prevent progression to T2DM in people with prediabetes.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 44 general practices in Leicestershire, England.
PARTICIPANTS: 880 participants with prediabetes randomised to receive either 
standard care or a 6-hour group structured education programme with follow-up 
sessions in a primary care setting.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost utility from the UK National Health 
Service (NHS) perspective. Quality of life and resource use measured from 
baseline and during the 36 months follow-up using the EuroQoL EQ-5D and 15D 
instruments and an economic questionnaire. Outcomes measured using 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs calculated in 2012-2013 
prices.
RESULTS: After accounting for clustering and missing data, the intervention 
group was found to have a net gain of 0.046 (95% CI -0.0171 to 0.109) QALYs over 
3 years, adjusted for baseline utility, at an additional cost of £168 (95% CI 
-395 to 732) per patient compared with the standard care group. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio is £3643/QALY with an 86% probability of being 
cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The education programme had higher costs and higher quality of life 
compared with the standard care group. The Let's Prevent programme is very 
likely to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20 000/QALY 
gained.
