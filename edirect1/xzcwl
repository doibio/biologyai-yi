INTRODUCTION: Suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours are common yet complex 
mental health presentations that can pose significant challenges for health 
professionals. The inability to accurately predict the individuals who may move 
from experiencing suicidal ideation and associated behaviours, to completing 
suicide, presents one such challenge. This can make it difficult to provide 
interventions and support to those most in need. Online health communities are 
one possible source of support for individuals who experience suicidal ideation 
and behaviours. These communities are becoming an increasingly popular way of 
accessing support, often with life-saving consequences. Within online 
communities, support is offered by various individuals including, in some 
instances, health professionals from various backgrounds, who work as online 
health community moderators. Given the growth of online communities and the 
increasing number of health professionals working as moderators, this scoping 
review seeks to map the literature that has focused on health professionals 
working as online community moderators, who interact with members experiencing 
suicidal ideation and behaviours. Mapping the existing literature offers 
benefits to both research and practice by identifying gaps in the research and 
providing a beginning knowledge base of current practice that can inform the 
training and development of health professionals working as community 
moderators.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow the methodological 
framework of Arksey and O'Malley, later adapted by Levac et al. To ensure 
appropriate rigour, this protocol uses the 20-item Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and extension for Scoping Reviews. 
Literature will be identified using a search strategy developed in consultation 
with a specialist research librarian at the university where the researchers are 
employed. Ten multidisciplinary databases will be independently searched by two 
researchers, and both researchers will screen for inclusion, and undertake the 
data extraction. The first author will perform a quality assessment of the 
articles that are selected for inclusion. A second researcher will complete a 
random audit of 20% of the included articles to assess for quality and 
suitability in answering the research questions. The first author will complete 
the analysis and synthesis of the data. A numerical and narrative synthesis of 
the included studies will be provided.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review has been deemed as being exempt 
from ethical review as no data will be collected from human participants. The 
results of the scoping review may be published in a peer-reviewed journal, 
thesis, presented at relevant conferences, and shared with relevant knowledge 
users.

BACKGROUND: Inaccurate diagnosis of appendicitis leads to increased costs and 
morbidity. Ultrasound costs less than computed tomography (CT) or MRI but has 
lower sensitivity and may not visualize the appendix.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analytic 
model of 10 imaging strategies for suspected appendicitis in a hypothetical 
cohort of patients: no imaging with discharge or surgery; CT only; MRI only; or 
staged approach with CT or MRI after 1) negative ultrasound result or ultrasound 
without appendix visualization, 2) ultrasound without appendix visualization, or 
3) ultrasound without appendix visualization but with secondary signs of 
inflammation. Inputs were derived from published literature and secondary data 
(quality-of-life and cost data). Sensitivity analyses varied risk of 
appendicitis and proportion of visualized ultrasound. Outcomes were 
effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), total direct medical costs, 
and cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained).
RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy for patients at moderate risk for 
appendicitis is initial ultrasound, followed by CT if the appendix is not 
visualized but secondary signs are present (cost of $4815.03; effectiveness of 
0.99694 QALYs). Other strategies were well above standard willingness-to-pay 
thresholds or were more costly and less effective. Cost-effectiveness was 
sensitive to patients' risk of appendicitis but not the proportion of visualized 
appendices.
CONCLUSIONS: Tailored approaches to imaging based on patients' risk of 
appendicitis are the most cost-effective. Imaging is not cost-effective in 
patients with a probability <16% or >95%. For moderate-risk patients, ultrasound 
without secondary signs of inflammation is sufficient even without appendix 
visualization.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a mobile health-supported 
lifestyle intervention compared with usual care.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the 
publicly-funded health care system. We estimated costs associated with the 
intervention and health care utilisation from first antenatal care appointment 
through delivery. We used bootstrap methods to quantify the uncertainty around 
cost-effectiveness estimates. Health outcomes assessed in this analysis were 
gestational weight gain (GWG; kg), incidence of excessive GWG, quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA). 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per QALY 
gained, cost per kg of GWG avoided, cost per case of excessive GWG averted, and 
cost per case of LGA averted.
RESULTS: Total mean cost including intervention and health care utilisation was 
€3745 in the intervention group and €3471 in the control group (mean difference 
€274, P = 0.08). The ICER was €2914 per QALY gained. Assuming a ceiling ratio of 
€45,000, the probability that the intervention was cost-effective based on QALYs 
was 79%. Cost per kg of GWG avoided was €209. The cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve (CEAC) for kg of GWG avoided reached a confidence level of 
95% at €905, indicating that if one is willing to pay a maximum of an additional 
€905 per kg of GWG avoided, there is a 95% probability that the intervention is 
cost-effective. Costs per case of excessive GWG averted and case of LGA averted 
were €2117 and €5911, respectively. The CEAC for case of excessive GWG averted 
and for case of LGA averted reached a confidence level of 95% at €7090 and 
€25,737, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a mobile-health lifestyle intervention could 
be cost-effective; however, a better understanding of the short- and long-term 
costs of LGA and excessive GWG is necessary to confirm the results.

BACKGROUND: The number of preventable inpatient deaths in the USA is commonly 
estimated as between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths annually. Because many inpatient 
deaths are believed to be preventable, mortality rates are used for quality 
measures and reimbursement. We aimed to estimate the proportion of inpatient 
deaths that are preventable.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and 
the Cochrane Library through April 8, 2019, was conducted. We included case 
series of adult patients who died in the hospital and were reviewed by 
physicians to determine if the death was preventable. Two reviewers 
independently performed data extraction and study quality assessment. The 
proportion of preventable deaths from individual studies was pooled using a 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. Eight studies of consecutive or 
randomly selected cohorts including 12,503 deaths were pooled. The pooled rate 
of preventable mortality was 3.1% (95% CI 2.2-4.1%). Two studies also reported 
rates of preventable mortality limited to patients expected to live longer than 
3 months, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0%. In the USA, these estimates correspond to 
approximately 22,165 preventable deaths annually and 7150 deaths for patients 
with greater than 3-month life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: The number of deaths due to medical error is lower than previously 
reported and the majority occur in patients with less than 3-month life 
expectancy. The vast majority of hospital deaths are due to underlying disease. 
Our results have implications for the use of hospital mortality rates for 
quality reporting and reimbursement.

BACKGROUND: Primary care is the main treatment setting for panic disorder and 
should be supplemented by collaborative care programs. However, shortage of 
mental health professionals prevents collaborative care programs from being 
effectively implemented. The PARADISE study showed the efficacy of a 
self-managed, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-oriented exposure training for 
patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care 
delivered by the family practice team.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the PARADISE intervention.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective based on data 
from a cluster-randomized controlled trial over a time horizon of 12 months.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred nineteen adult panic disorder patients with or 
without agoraphobia.
INTERVENTIONS: A self-managed, CBT-oriented exposure training for patients with 
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care delivered by the 
primary care practice team in comparison to routine care.
MAIN MEASURES: Total costs from the societal perspective. Direct costs and 
disease-specific costs. Quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D-3L. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves.
KEY RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group caused lower costs (mean, €1017; 
95% confidence interval [-€3306; €1272]; p = 0.38) and gained on average more 
QALY (mean, 0.034 QALY (95% confidence interval [0.005; 0.062]; p = 0.02). 
Therefore, the intervention dominated the control treatment. The probability of 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention at a willingness-to-pay margin of €50,000 
per QALY was 96%. Results from supplementary analyses considering direct or 
disease-specific costs instead of total costs showed comparable results.
CONCLUSION: The PARADISE intervention is cost effective. This conclusion is 
valid for total costs, generic health care (direct) costs, disease-specific 
health care costs.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary 
intracranial tumor. The tumor metastases outside the CNS are rare, so 
therapeutic experience with these types of tumors is limited. We present a case 
of a 20-year-old female with a history of left temporal anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma, who was found to have biopsy proven metastases tothe lung. In 
April 2014, the patient presented with intermittent headache for 4 months. 
Physical examinations confirmed no obvious abnormalities. Computed tomography 
(CT) scan and magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of the brain showed a large 
mass with ring-like enhancement in left temporal lobe. She underwent craniotomy 
to resect the intracranial tumor. Thepathological investigation showed the 
lesion to be a classical anaplastic oligoastrocytoma with focal necrosis and a 
Ki-67 labeling index of 10-30%. After operation, the patient received 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Two years later, the patient readmitted due to 
chest discomfort, a chest X-ray and CT showed a mass in the right lung. The 
lesion was confirmed to be a metastatic malignant glioma viapulmonary 
bronchoscopy biopsy. In conclusion, as the life expectancy is gradually 
increasing for GBM patients with newer therapies, the incidence of extracranial 
metastases may increase and this rare phenomenon may become more common and 
clinically relevant.

BACKGROUND: Midostaurin (MIDO) combined with standard chemotherapy was approved 
by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 for the treatment of adults with newly 
diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on results from the 
RATIFY trial.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare MIDO and 
standard-of-care (SOC) to SOC alone in France. Per Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) 
guidelines, a partitioned survival model with eight health states was used: 
diagnosis/induction, complete remission, relapse, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), HSCT recovery, post-HSCT recovery (stabilized after HSCT 
recovery), post-HSCT relapse, and mortality. A lifetime horizon was used 
beginning at diagnosis with a "cure model,", which assumed natural mortality 
after trial cut-off. Utility values were obtained from a systematic literature 
review and included disutilities. Resource utilization was based on HAS clinical 
guidelines and a survey of French physicians and included drugs and 
administration, adverse events, routine medical care, HSCT, and end-of-life care 
costs.
RESULTS: In RATIFY and after extrapolation, MIDO improved survival compared to 
SOC, translating into MIDO-treated patients gaining 1.12 life years (LYs) and 
1.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus SOC. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MIDO versus SOC was €68,781 per LY and 
€62,305 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed consistency with base case 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: MIDO represents a clinically significant advancement in the 
management of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. In this analysis, MIDO add-on 
therapy showed gains in LYs and QALYs versus SOC alone and was found to be a 
cost-effective option at a €100,000 per QALY threshold for end-of-life 
treatment.

This article provides a detailed and overarching illustration of the 
contribution of smoking to sex differences in life expectancy at birth (e0) in 
Europe, focusing on changes over time and differences between both European 
countries and European regions. For this purpose, the sex difference in e0 for 
31 European countries over the 1950-2014 period was decomposed into a smoking- 
and a non-smoking-related part, using all-cause mortality data and indirectly 
estimated smoking-attributable mortality rates by age and sex, and a formal 
decomposition analysis. It was found that smoking-attributable mortality 
contributed, on average, 3 years (43.5%) to the 7-year life expectancy 
difference between women and men in 2014. This contribution, was largest in 
1995, at 5.2 out of 9.0 years, and subsequently declined in parallel with the 
average sex difference in life expectancy. The average contribution of 
smoking-attributable mortality was especially large in North-Western Europe 
around 1975; in Southern Europe around 1985; and in Eastern Europe around 
1990-1995, when smoking-attributable mortality reached maximum levels among men, 
but was still low among women. The observed parallel decline from 1995 onwards 
in the sex differences in e0 and the absolute contribution of smoking to this 
sex difference suggests that this recent decline in the sex difference in e0 can 
be almost fully explained by historical changes in sex differences in smoking, 
and, consequently, smoking-attributable mortality. In line with the progression 
of the smoking epidemic, the sex differences in life expectancy in Europe are 
expected to further decline in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Data are needed to demonstrate that providing an "intermediate" level 
of type 1 diabetes (T1D) care is cost-effective compared to "minimal" care in 
less-resourced countries. We studied these care scenarios in six countries.
METHODS: We modeled the complications/costs/mortality/healthy life years (HLYs) 
associated with "intermediate" care including two blood glucose tests/day (mean 
HbA1c 9.0% [75 mmol/mol]) in three lower-gross domestic product (GDP) countries 
(Mali, Tanzania, Pakistan), or three tests/day (mean HbA1c 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]) 
in three higher-GDP countries (Bolivia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan); and compared 
findings to "minimal" care (mean HbA1c 12.5% [113 mmol/mol]). A discrete time 
Markov illness-death model with age and calendar-year-dependent transition 
probabilities was developed, with inputs of 30 years of complications and 
Standardized Mortality Rate data from the youth cohort in the Pittsburgh 
Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study, background mortality, and costs 
determined from international and local prices.
RESULTS: Cumulative 30 years incidences of complications were much lower for 
"intermediate care" than "minimal care", for example, for renal failure 
incidence was 68.1% (HbA1c 12.5%) compared to 3.9% (9%) and 2.4% (8.5%). For 
Mali, Tanzania, Pakistan, Bolivia, Sri Lanka, and Azerbaijan, 30 years survival 
was 50.1%/52.7%/76.7%/72.5%/82.8%/89.2% for "intermediate" and 
8.5%/10.1%/39.4%/25.8%/45.5%/62.1% for "minimal" care, respectively. The cost of 
a HLY gained as a % GDP/capita was 141.1%/110.0%/52.3%/41.8%/17.0%/15.6%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Marked reductions in complications rates and mortality are 
achievable with "intermediate" T1D care achieving mean clinic HbA1c of 8.5% to 
9% (69-75 mmol/mol). This is also "very cost-effective" in four of six countries 
according to the WHO "Fair Choices" approach which costs HLYs gained against 
GDP/capita.

Cost-utility analyses of targeted immunomodulators in rheumatoid arthritis: 
systematic review.

Aims: Cost-utility (CU) modeling is a common technique used to determine whether 
new treatments represent good value for money. As with any modeling exercise, 
findings are a direct result of methodology choices, which may vary widely. 
Several targeted immuno-modulators have been launched in recent years to treat 
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which have been evaluated using CU 
methods. Our objectives were to identify common and innovative modeling choices 
in moderate-to-severe RA and to highlight their implications for future models 
in RA.Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to 
identify CU models in moderate-to-severe RA published from January 2013 to June 
2019. Studies must have included an active comparator and used quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) as the common measure of effectiveness. Modeling methods were 
characterized by stakeholder perspective, simulation type, mapping between 
parameters, and data sources.Results: Thirty-one published modeling studies were 
reviewed spanning 13 countries and 9 drugs, with common methodological choices 
and innovations observed among them. Over the evaluated time period, we observed 
common methods and assumptions that are becoming more prominent in the RA CU 
modeling landscape, including patient-level simulations, two-stage models 
combining trial results and real-world evidence, real-world treatment durations, 
long-term health consequences, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)-related 
hospitalization costs. Models that consider the societal perspective are 
increasingly being developed as well.Limitations: This review did not consider 
studies that did not report QALYs as a utility measure, models published only as 
conference abstracts, or cost-consequence models that did not report an 
incremental CU ratio.Conclusions: CU modeling for RA increasingly reflects 
real-world conditions and patient experiences which are anticipated to provide 
better information in the assessment of health technologies. Future CU models in 
RA should consider applying the observed advances in modeling choices to 
optimize their CU predictions and simulation of real-world outcomes.

Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of mirogabalin versus no treatment 
or pregabalin in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) from a third-party 
perspective in Taiwan.Methods: A Markov model, which was developed with 2-week 
cycles and 1-year time horizon from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance 
Administration perspective, consisted of three health states: "mild," 
"moderate," and "severe" pain. Average daily pain score (ADPS) was assessed at 
the end of each cycle. Patients either remained in, or transitioned from, their 
assigned health state to a different state according to their pain score 
changes. All patients entered the model in "moderate" (4 ≤ ADPS <7) or "severe" 
(7 ≤ ADPS ≤ 10) pain health states. Efficacy data was informed by the pivotal 
Phase III trial, or by a network meta-analysis (NMA). Utility values were 
obtained from published literature and cost data from Taiwanese clinical experts 
and the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration, using 2018 New Taiwan 
dollar (NT$). Probabilistic analysis was conducted to test the robustness of 
base case results.Results: Head-to-head analysis showed mirogabalin 30 mg to be 
cost-effective versus placebo in PHN. The deterministic analysis estimated a 
quality-adjusted life years gain of 0.041 at an ICER of NT$11,231 (US$365) 
versus no treatment (ICER: NT$274,567 [US$8,900]). In the NMAs, mirogabalin was 
cost-effective compared to pregabalin 150 mg (ICER: NT$515,881 [US$16,720]) and 
300 mg (ICER: NT$201,671 [US$6,535]). Mirogabalin 30 mg dominated pregabalin 
600 mg. Results from sensitivity and scenario analyses confirmed these 
results.Conclusion: Mirogabalin 30 mg, a potent and selective α2δ ligand, is a 
cost-effective treatment option for PHN in Taiwan, with ICERs below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold.

[Lack of doctors, but for what System? Shortage of clinicians in Italy and 
Lombardy and reflections on structural constrains in training].

A lack of physicians is a major threat in many health care systems. Italy is 
coping with this problem, by increasing the number of residency training 
positions for medical graduates. Nevertheless, analysis of data and a critical 
review of organisational aspects of the system seem to suggest that structural 
changes are also needed. Eight areas are discussed: 1. The (very high) age of 
physicians in the country; 2. The (problematic) organisation of the health care 
delivery system; 3. The (uneven) distribution of residency training positions 
across the regions; 4. The (inadequate) mix of workforce between physicians and 
nurses; 5. The (biased) preferences for choosing a medical specialty; 6. The 
(emblematic) case of training for Gps; 7. The (unprecedent) growth of life 
expectancy and comorbidity; 8. The (absence of a) plan and method for recruiting 
workforce in health care at national level. The authors conclude that the 
solution for the lack of medical specialists is less a matter of increasing the 
number of residency training positions and more a matter of solving some 
structural constraints of the system. Solutions might have to do - for instance 
- with the introduction of the recognition of the professional role of 
physicians in residency training (especially for GPs - like in UK). Another 
aspect to be taken in consideration is also the professional role and 
competencies of nurses, that could be widened.

IMPORTANCE: Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for 
relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been approved 
for use in multiple jurisdictions. The public list price is US $475 000, or more 
than CaD $600 000. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is 
necessary to inform policy makers on the economic value of this treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value for money of tisagenlecleucel compared with 
current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible pediatric patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia under unknown long-term effectiveness.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel 
compared with current standard care using a Canadian population-based registry 
of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was performed. Results 
from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial 
pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, 
respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting 
clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. 
Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict 
patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel 
efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10% to 40%, to account 
for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested 
with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data were collected in 
September 2017, and analysis began in December 2017.
EXPOSURES: Tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for 
tisagenlecleucel-eligible patients.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative health care costs, survival gains, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between tisagenlecleucel and current 
standard care.
RESULTS: The treatment and control arms were modeled on 192 and 118 patients, 
respectively. The mean (SD) age of control individuals was 10 (4.25) years, and 
the mean (SD) age of the pooled clinical trial sample was 11 (6) years. The 
control individuals had 78 boys (66%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 
102 boys (53%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an 
additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current 
care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD $470 013 (US 
$357 031). Accounting for the total discounted cost over the patient lifetime 
resulted in an incremental cost of CaD $71 000 (US $53 933) to CaD $281 000 (US 
$213 453) per QALY gain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this study offers the first 
cost-effectiveness analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard 
care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a 
constructed population-based control arm. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$150 000/QALY, tisagenlecleucel had a 32% likelihood of being cost-effective. 
Tisagenlecleucel cost-effectiveness would fall below $50 000/QALY with a 
long-term cure rate of over 0.40 or a price discount of 49% at its currently 
known effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Human life expectancy has increased rapidly in recent decades. 
Regular exercise can promote health, but the effect of exercise on mortality is 
not yet well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of exercise with mortality in the 
older people.
METHODS: We used data from annual health check-ups of the older citizens of 
Taipei in 2006. Participants were interviewed by trained nurses using a 
structured questionnaire to collect data on demographics and lifestyle 
behaviours. Overnight fasting blood was collected for measuring blood glucose, 
liver and renal function and lipid profiles. Exercise frequency was categorised 
into no exercise, 1-2 times in a week and more than 3-5 times in a week. 
All-cause mortality was ascertained from the National Registration of Death. All 
participants were followed up until death or December 312012, whichever came 
first. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to 
investigate the association between exercise and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 42,047 older people were analysed; 22,838 (54.32%) were male 
and with a mean (SD) age of 74.58 (6.32) years. Kaplan-Meier curves of all-cause 
mortality stratified by exercise frequency demonstrated significant findings 
(Log-rank P < 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that older 
people with higher exercise levels had a significantly decreased risk of 
mortality (moderate exercise HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.68-0.81, high exercise 
HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.59-0.70) after adjusting for potential confounders, with a 
significant trend (P for trend<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Older people with increased exercise levels had a significantly 
decreased risk of all-cause mortality.

I look at three debates in the health economics literature in the context of 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA): 1) inclusion of future costs, 2) discounting, 
and 3) consistency with a welfare-economic perspective. These debates thus far 
have been studied in isolation leading to confusion and lingering questions. I 
look at these three debates holistically and present a welfare theoretic model 
that is consistent with the practice of CEA and can help inform all of these 
three debates. It shows rationales for the recommendations of the Second Panel 
and clarifies some nuanced implications for the practice of CEA when taking a 
societal perspective in the context of distributional CEA and multi-sectorial 
budgets.

Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric intraocular malignant tumor. 
Unfortunately, low cure rates and low life expectancy are observed in low-income 
countries. Thus, alternative therapies are needed for patients who do not 
respond to current treatments or those with advanced cases of the disease. Ether 
à-go-go-1 (Eag1) is a voltage-gated potassium channel involved in cancer. Eag1 
expression is upregulated by the human papilloma virus (HPV) oncogene E7, 
suggesting that retinoblastoma protein (pRb) may regulate Eag1. Astemizole is an 
antihistamine that is suggested to be repurposed for cancer treatment; it 
targets proteins implicated in cancer, including histamine receptors, ATP 
binding cassette transporters, and Eag channels. Here, we investigated Eag1 
regulation using pRb and Eag1 expression in human retinoblastoma. The effect of 
astemizole on the cell proliferation of primary human retinoblastoma cultures 
was also studied. HeLa cervical cancer cells (HPV-positive and expressing Eag1) 
were transfected with RB1. Eag1 mRNA expression was studied using qPCR, and 
protein expression was assessed using western blotting and immunochemistry. Cell 
proliferation was evaluated with an MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. RB1 
transfection down-regulated Eag1 mRNA and protein expression. The human 
retinoblastoma samples displayed heterogeneous Eag1 mRNA and protein expression. 
Astemizole decreased cell proliferation in primary retinoblastoma cultures. Our 
results suggest that Eag1 mRNA and protein expression was regulated by pRb in 
vitro, and that human retinoblastoma tissues had heterogeneous Eag1 mRNA and 
protein expression. Furthermore, our results propose that the multitarget drug 
astemizole may have clinical relevance in patients with retinoblastoma, for 
instance, in those who do not respond to current treatments.

As global life expectancy has increased in most countries, there is a rising 
percentage of patients over 65 years old being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 
Despite an increase in the incidence and prevalence of colorectal cancer in 
older adults, this cohort receives adjuvant therapy at a decreased rate due to 
anticipated intolerance. The presumed limitations seem to be based on 
chronologic age, competing life limiting diagnoses, and the paucity of data 
studying this population in major clinical trials. This review explores the data 
regarding disparities in the treatment of older patients with colorectal cancer, 
safety and efficacy of adjuvant therapy, and newer tools to make decisions based 
on the biologic age, rather than chronologic age, of the patient.

Patients 80 years old or older are increasingly being admitted to intensive care 
units, particularly in western countries, where life expectancy is constantly 
increasing. The benefits of intensively treating critically ill elderly patients 
are uncertain. The high mortality rate in the presence of underlying chronic 
diseases is a factor. More generally, frailty, defined as an impaired resilience 
following a health stressor event, must be taken into account. No consensus 
exists on the risk-benefit ratio to admit octogenarians to the ICU. Treatment 
decisions should account for life expectancy but also tailored to the needs and 
wishes of patients and next-of-kins. The cohort of elderly patients is known to 
be the most vulnerable to functional decline and cognitive impairment, including 
neuropsychological complications, such as delirium.. Interventions directed at 
reducing the incidence of delirium may mitigate brain injury associated with 
critical illness, potentially being the single most effective intervention in 
this population. A multimodal approach to analgesia should be considered to 
avoid untreated pain and its consequences. Sleep protocols can effectively 
reduce the risk of delirium. Notably, the deployment of "sleep bundles" (regular 
sleep-wake rhythms, reduced night-time light, noise control strategies), may be 
helpful. As well, adequate nutritional support, spontaneous awakening trials, 
early mobilization, and physical therapy are crucial to prevent physical 
deconditioning. The psychological consequences of critical illness for both 
patients and caregivers are also being increasingly recognized. Attention to the 
needs of families is essential, due to its positive effects on patients and as a 
quality improvement goal by itself. Death and dying in the ICU is a more 
frequent outcome in the elderly population. A real culture for the management of 
distress and grieving is a required skill for the ICU staff. Privacy and 
adequate palliative care should be contemplated for an ethical and comfortable 
end of life.

Economic Evaluation of Adding Daratumumab to a Regimen of Bortezomib + 
Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Based on the Latest 
Updated Analysis of CASTOR.

PURPOSE: Adding daratumumab to a regimen of bortezomib + dexamethasone (Vd) has 
been reported to provide a benefit of longer progression-free survival in 
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, it is 
still unclear whether the addition of daratumumab is cost-effective in RRMM. 
Based on the latest updated analysis of data from the CASTOR trial, this study 
performed an economic evaluation of the addition of daratumumab to Vd in 
patients with RRMM.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was used for estimating the long-term costs and 
efficacy of Vd with or without daratumumab in patients with RRMM. Data on 
efficacy were taken from the CASTOR trial to compare Vd + daratumumab with Vd. 
Costs were taken from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and from 
the literature. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to address the 
robustness of the model. Variations in the price of daratumumab and subgroup 
analyses were conducted.
FINDINGS: The base-case analysis showed that adding daratumumab to Vd provided 
an additional 1.256 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or 1.645 life-years 
(LYs), with incremental 213,164 USD (163,184 USD) per QALY (LY) gained. 
Univariate sensitivity analyses suggested that the subsequent treatment cost of 
DVd and the price of daratumumab had the greatest effect on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. According to the variations analysis of the price of 
daratumumab, the addition of daratumumab would be cost-effective when 
daratumumab was priced at 70% (30%) of the current price at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of 200,000 USD/QALY (150,000 USD/QALY). Subgroup analysis indicated 
that adding daratumumab to Vd was most cost-effective in patients with 1 prior 
line of therapy.
IMPLICATIONS: From a US-payer perspective, daratumumab added to Vd in RRMM is 
likely to exceed the common accepted values of cost-effectiveness.
