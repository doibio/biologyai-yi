Globally, patients living with sickle cell disease are now surviving to 
reproductive age, with life expectancy approaching 50 years in most countries. 
Thus, reproductive options are now essential for patients living with the 
condition. However, it can be associated with maternal, delivery, and fetal 
complications. Outcomes may vary depending on the level of expertise and 
resources. In this piece we provide an optional guideline for managing sickle 
cell disease in pregnancy. The therapeutic option of serial exchange 
prophylactic transfusion has been offered in the context of a clinical trial 
(TAPS2).

INTRODUCTION: Although mHealth technology is an emerging approach for enabling 
self-management/education of hip/knee osteoarthritis (OA) that may reduce 
burdens in primary and secondary care, no scoping review has been conducted to 
comprehensively review the scope of mHealth technology in managing hip/knee OA. 
This scoping review and scientometric analyses aimed to summarize the current 
state of research on the use of mHealth technology (mobile 
applications/web-based interventions) for self-management/education of adults 
with hip/knee OA, identify key research activities, and provide future 
directions on the development/usage of mHealth technology.
METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework was employed, 
augmented with scientometric analyses. Six databases were searched from 
inception to 31 May 2021. Findings were reported according to the PRISMA 
extension for scoping review. Co-word, co-author, and co-citation scientometric 
analyses were conducted to examine the social and intellectual connections of 
the research field (e.g., research hotspots and researcher collaborations).
RESULTS: Twenty mHealth programs for promoting self-management of hip/knee OA 
were identified. The programs mainly included exercises or directives on 
performance of exercises. Compared to no interventions, mHealth technology was 
usable and might be more effective in improving pain, physical function, and 
quality of life in individuals with OA. The scientometric analyses identified 
multiple co-occurring keywords that reflected conceptual properties of this 
research domain. Although some intellectual connections among authors, research 
articles, and journals were noted, there were insufficient international 
collaborations in this field.
DISCUSSION: While individual small-scale studies highlighted promising 
short-term effects of mHealth technology in self-managing hip/knee OA, many 
mHealth technologies were developed without clinicians' and/or patients' 
contributions. Future mHealth programs should be developed based on a strong 
theoretical background and professional inputs. The long-term benefits and 
cost-effectiveness of mHealth technologies, user experience, as well as 
cross-cultural adaptation of these technologies should be evaluated.

Ivosidenib + azacitidine (IVO/AZA) is approved in the United States for newly 
diagnosed, older or intensive chemotherapy-ineligible patients with IDH1-mutated 
acute myeloid leukemia. We created a partitioned survival analysis model to 
evaluate the health economic implications of this approval. Model outputs were 
used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IVO/AZA 
versus AZA. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. In 
the base case scenario, IVO/AZA and AZA resulted in life-time costs of $403,062 
and $161,887, respectively. With an incremental gain of 0.95 QALYs, the ICER of 
IVO/AZA was $252,782/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, only a reduction in the 
price of IVO by 59.3% lowered the ICER to below $150,000/QALY and 99.95% of 
model calculations yielded ICERs of >$150,000/QALY. In a model in which all 
patients received IVO monotherapy after progression on AZA monotherapy, the ICER 
was $155,453/QALY and various model inputs that would make IVO/AZA 
cost-effective were identified.

In this study, endophytic fungus Curvularia lunata strain SL1 was used to 
explore its bioremediation potential and growth restoration of tomato (Solanum 
lycopersicum) under cadmium (Cd) stress. Our findings demonstrate that SL1 
establishes a symbiotic relationship with tomato plants, which modulates the 
antioxidant system, secondary metabolites, and gene expression in tomato plants 
exposed to Cd stress. Under Cd stress, tomato seedling growth was significantly 
reduced by up to 42.8 %, although this reduction was mitigated by up to 25 % 
after SL1 inoculation. Similar to this, SLI inoculation inhibits Cd absorption 
and translocation to the upper parts of the plant. Additionally, during Cd 
stress, phytohormones related to stress, including jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic 
acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), were elevated; however, SL1 inoculation lowered 
their level. RNA-Seq data revealed that the highest number of differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) was detected in the comparison between control and 1 mM 
Cd, followed by 2 mM Cd stress. These DEGs were mostly related to oxidoreductase 
activity, catalytic activity, plant hormones transduction, and photosynthesis. 
The findings also suggested that SL1 could improve tomato tolerance to Cd stress 
by modulating Ca2+ signaling, phytohormone biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, 
and some transcription factors.

Genomic selection increases accuracy and decreases generation interval, 
accelerating genetic changes in populations. Assumptions of genetic improvement 
must be addressed to quantify the magnitude and direction of change. Genetic 
trends of US dairy cattle breeds were examined to determine the genetic gain 
since the implementation of genomic evaluations in 2009. Inbreeding levels and 
generation intervals were also investigated. Breeds included Ayrshire, Brown 
Swiss, Guernsey, Holstein (HO), and Jersey (JE), which were characterized by the 
evaluation breed the animal received. Mean genomic predicted breeding values 
(PBV¯) were analyzed per year to calculate genetic trends for bulls and cows. 
The data set contained 154,008 bulls and 33,022,242 cows born since 1975. 
Breakpoints were estimated using linear regression, and nonlinear regression was 
used to fit the piecewise model for the small sample number in some years. 
Generation intervals and inbreeding levels were also investigated since 1975. 
Milk, fat, and protein yields, somatic cell score, productive life, daughter 
pregnancy rate, and livability PBV¯ were documented. In 2017, 100% of bulls in 
this data set were genotyped. The percentage of genotyped cows has increased 23 
percentage points since 2010. Overall, production traits have increased steadily 
over time, as expected. The HO and JE breeds have benefited most from genomics, 
with up to 192% increase in genetic gain since 2009. Due to the low number of 
observations, trends for Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, and Guernsey are difficult to 
infer from. Trends in fertility are most substantial; particularly, most breeds 
are trending downwards and daughter pregnancy rate for JE has been decreasing 
steadily since 1975 for bulls and cows. Levels of genomic inbreeding are 
increasing in HO bulls and cows. In 2017, genomic inbreeding levels were 12.7% 
for bulls and 7.9% for cows. A suggestion to control this is to include the 
genomic inbreeding coefficient with a negative weight to the selection index of 
bulls with high future genomic inbreeding levels. For sires of bulls, the 
current generation intervals are 2.2 yr in HO, 3.2 in JE, 4.4 in Brown Swiss, 
5.1 in Ayrshire, and 4.3 in Guernsey. The number of colored breed bulls in the 
United States is currently at an extremely low level, and this number will only 
increase with a market incentive or additional breed association involvement. 
Increased education and extension could be beneficial to increase knowledge 
about inbreeding levels, use of genomics and genetic improvement, and genetic 
diversity in the genomic selection era.

PURPOSE: The introduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapy has drastically 
improved the life expectancy of patients with advanced cancer. Despite improved 
survival, obtaining long-term response can be highly distressing and comes with 
uncertainties that affect several life domains. The aim of this study is to gain 
a deeper understanding of long-term responders' lived experiences with obtaining 
long-term response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy.
METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using thematic data 
analysis. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 patients 
with advanced melanoma or lung cancer who had a confirmed response to or 
long-term stable disease while on immunotherapy or targeted therapy.
RESULTS: Long-term responders are living in a twilight zone, where they neither 
feel like a patient, nor feel healthy. This impacts their self-image, 
interactions with their social environment, and feelings of uncertainty. Due to 
their uncertain life perspective, long-term responders are going back and forth 
between hope and despair, while they are longing for their 'old' life, several 
barriers, such as protective behavior of the social environment, force them to 
adjust to a life with cancer.
CONCLUSION: Long-term responders are facing many challenges, such as searching 
for a renewed identity, dealing with ongoing uncertainty, and having to adapt to 
a new normal. This emphasizes the importance of providing this new patient group 
with tailored information and support.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Healthcare professionals can support patients 
by normalizing their feelings and providing space for varying emotions. Using 
patient-tailored scan frequencies could help temper fear of progression.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term costs and health effects of the Swedish 
newborn screening program for classic phenylketonuria (PKU) alone and in 
combination with congenital hypothyroidism compared with no screening.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate and compare 
the long-term (80 years) costs and health effects of newborn screening for PKU 
and congenital hypothyroidism. Data were obtained from the literature and 
translated to Swedish conditions. A societal perspective was taken, including 
costs falling on health care providers, municipal care and services, as well as 
production loss due to morbidity.
RESULTS: Screening 100 000 newborns for PKU resulted in 73 gained 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with no screening. When adding 
congenital hypothyroidism, the number of gained QALYs was 232 compared with PKU 
alone, adding up to a total of 305 QALYs gained. Corresponding cost estimates 
were $80.8, $70.3, and $10.05 million USD for no screening, PKU screening, and 
PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism screening, respectively, indicating that 
screening for PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism was more effective and less 
costly compared with the other strategies. The majority of cost savings with PKU 
plus congenital hypothyroidism screening was due to reductions in productivity 
losses and municipal care and services costs.
CONCLUSION: The Swedish newborn screening program for PKU and congenital 
hypothyroidism saves substantial costs for society while generating additional 
QALYs, emphasizing the importance of public investments in early diagnosis and 
treatment.

Antimicrobial Active Packaging Containing Nisin for Preservation of Products of 
Animal Origin: An Overview.

The preservation of food represents one of the greatest challenges in the food 
industry. Active packaging materials are obtained through the incorporation of 
antimicrobial and/or antioxidant compounds in order to improve their 
functionality. Further, these materials are used for food packaging applications 
for shelf-life extension and fulfilling consumer demands for minimal processed 
foods with great quality and safety. The incorporation of antimicrobial 
peptides, such as nisin, has been studied lately, with a great interest applied 
to the food industry. Antimicrobials can be incorporated in various matrices 
such as nanofibers, nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, or nanoparticles, which are 
further used for packaging. Despite the widespread application of nisin as an 
antimicrobial by directly incorporating it into various foods, the use of nisin 
by incorporating it into food packaging materials is researched at a much 
smaller scale. The researchers in this field are still in full development, 
being specific to the type of product studied. The purpose of this study was to 
present recent results obtained as a result of using nisin as an antimicrobial 
agent in food packaging materials, with a focus on applications on products of 
animal origin. The findings showed that nisin incorporated in packaging 
materials led to a significant reduction in the bacterial load (the total viable 
count or inoculated strains), maintained product attributes (physical, chemical, 
and sensorial), and prolonged their shelf-life.

Assuring the safety of muscle foods and seafood is based on prerequisites and 
specific measures targeted against defined hazards. This concept is augmented by 
'interventions', which are chemical or physical treatments, not genuinely part 
of the production process, but rather implemented in the framework of a safety 
assurance system. The present paper focuses on 'Cold Atmospheric pressure 
Plasma' (CAP) as an emerging non-thermal intervention for microbial 
decontamination. Over the past decade, a vast number of studies have explored 
the antimicrobial potential of different CAP systems against a plethora of 
different foodborne microorganisms. This contribution aims at providing a 
comprehensive reference and appraisal of the latest literature in the area, with 
a specific focus on the use of CAP for the treatment of fresh meat, fish and 
associated products to inactivate microbial pathogens and extend shelf life. 
Aspects such as changes to organoleptic and nutritional value alongside other 
matrix effects are considered, so as to provide the reader with a clear insight 
into the advantages and disadvantages of CAP-based decontamination strategies.

PURPOSE: Sexual function is crucial for the quality of life and can be highly 
affected by preoperative therapy and surgery. The aim of this study was to 
identify potential risk factors for poor sexual function and quality of life.
METHODS: Female patients were asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index 
(FSFI-6). Male patients were demanded to answer the International Index of 
Erectile Function (IIEF-5).
RESULTS: In total, 79 patients filled in the questionary, yielding a response 
rate of 41.57%. The proportion of women was represented by 32.91%, and the 
median age was 76.0 years (66.0-81.0). Sexual dysfunction appeared in 88.46% of 
female patients. Severe erectile dysfunction occurred in 52.83% of male 
patients. Univariate analysis showed female patients (OR: 0.17, 95%CI: 
0.05-0.64, p = 0.01), older age (OR: 0.34, 95%CI 0.11-1.01, p = 0.05), tumor 
localization under 6cm from the anal verge (OR: 4.43, 95%CI: 1.44-13.67, p = 
0.01) and extension of operation (APR and ISR) (OR: 0.13, 95%CI: 0.03-0.59, p = 
0.01) as significant risk factors for poor outcome. Female patients (OR: 0.12, 
95%CI: 0.03-0.62, p = 0.01) and tumors below 6 cm from the anal verge (OR: 4.64, 
95%CI: 1.18-18.29, p = 0.03) were shown to be independent risk factors for 
sexual dysfunction after multimodal therapy in the multivariate analysis. 
Quality of life was only affected in the case of extensive surgery (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Higher Age, female sex, distal tumors and extensive surgery (APR, 
ISR) are revealed risk factors for SD in this study. Quality of life was only 
affected in the case of APR or ISR.

This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of human 
melioidosis in Southeast Asia as well as to highlight knowledge gaps in the 
prevalence and risk factors of this life-threatening disease using available 
evidence-based data for better diagnosis and treatment. Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) was used as the guideline for this review. The literature search 
was conducted on 23 March 2022 through two electronic databases (PubMed and 
Scopus) using lists of keywords referring to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 
thesaurus. A total of 38 articles related to human melioidosis were included 
from 645 screened articles. These studies were carried out between 1986 and 2019 
in six Southeast Asian countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, 
Singapore, and Vietnam. Melioidosis has been reported with a high disease 
prevalence among high-risk populations. Studies in Thailand (48.0%) and Cambodia 
(74.4%) revealed disease prevalence in patients with septic arthritis and 
children with suppurative parotitis, respectively. Other studies in Thailand 
(63.5%) and Malaysia (54.4% and 65.7%) showed a high seroprevalence of 
melioidosis among Tsunami survivors and military personnel, respectively. 
Additionally, this review documented soil and water exposure, diabetes mellitus, 
chronic renal failure, thalassemia, and children under the age of 15 as the main 
risk factors for melioidosis. Human melioidosis is currently under-reported in 
Southeast Asia and its true prevalence is unknown.

The Care of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities: Informal (Family) Caregivers' 
Perspectives.

Gutowska A(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Andragogy and Social Gerontology, University of Lodz, 90-136 
Łodź, Poland.

CONTEXT: The care of adults with intellectual disabilities is marginalized and 
rarely studied in Poland. In recent years, this issue has gained particular 
importance, partly due to the increasing life expectancy of people with ID. This 
paper presents a study of the function of informal caregivers for adults with 
ID, comprising parents who provide regular, constant, physical and emotional 
support and assistance with everyday activities to their adult children. Due to 
cultural and institutional conditions, Polish society sets high expectations for 
families regarding the care of their dependent members. Social policy also 
mainly promotes informal care, with formal care only being supported to a very 
limited extent. The state delegates responsibility, including financial 
responsibility, to families. With the rapid aging of society, this situation 
poses great challenges.
METHODS: This study was conducted in the Łodź region of Poland; it used a 
qualitative approach, and a semi-structured interview was performed using the 
narrative elements technique. The main goal of the research was to understand 
the situation of caregivers to adults with an intellectual disability by 
identifying thematic categories in the respondents' statements. The analysis of 
the qualitative data content made it possible to capture and present the 
participants' personal perspectives on significant issues connected with their 
function in the context of providing care to an adult with an intellectual 
disability. A total of 12 interviews were conducted. The age of the respondents 
(caregivers) was 51-82 years old, and the individuals they were caring for were 
between 20 and 49 years old.
RESULTS: Based on the materials collected, 13 thematic categories and 
subcategories were identified, along with illustrative examples. The main 
categories concerned everyday functioning, health, uncertainty, relationships 
with others, feelings, time, and the macro level. For each category, 
subcategories were distinguished and illustrated by the respondents' statements. 
The categories and subcategories were not completely distinct; sometimes they 
overlapped or complemented one another.
CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of the respondents, the care of an adult with an 
intellectual disability had a negative effect on their well-being. As a 
consequence, they performed their caregiver's role at the expense of their own 
lifestyle. Noticeable themes included "addiction" to caregiving, psychophysical 
fatigue, and the needs and difficulties resulting from this being "ignored" by 
the commonly understood social environment (including state institutions). Thus, 
the care of dependent adults with ID should be viewed on a broad human spectrum, 
that is, in consideration of the unique situation of those who remain under 
permanent care provided by family members, those who live alone, and those whose 
loved ones try to combine caregiving with their own private lives. This is 
becoming all the more important, as the number of seniors with intellectual 
disabilities will continue to grow in the coming decades.

An aging population is considered a major challenge for governments and 
healthcare planners. eHealth is perceived as a tool with the potential to ensure 
efficient healthcare. Moreover, eHealth services may help older adults to 
maintain longer life in good health. However, there are still several challenges 
to the large-scale implementation of these solutions among older adults. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore determinants of the acceptance 
and use of eHealth by older adults in Poland. Data was collected by the 
questionnaire, and the UTAUT model was employed. This research covered older 
adults aged 60 to 69. The analysis of the results using nested regression 
analysis showed that performance expectancy has a strong significance on the 
older adults' acceptance and use of eHealth, followed by effort expectancy and 
social influence. In contrast, facilitating conditions do not have a significant 
influence on the acceptance and use of eHealth. These findings may also be 
beneficial for the government to provide relative policies to support the 
development and usage of eHealth services as well as for the healthcare devices 
industry to design more older adult-oriented products.

Increased life expectancy and high costs of medicines and medical care have led 
to the use of herbal products. However, these items may contain toxic compounds 
that have an impact on public health. We will focus on the regulatory aspects 
and differences of these products marketed in the North American region 
(USA-Mexico-Canada) from government websites and selected literature. Mexico has 
an ancestral tradition of using plants for the treatment, improvement, and 
maintenance of human health as compared with Canada and the USA Currently, the 
use of herbal products in this region has a regulatory framework. The legal 
framework in these three countries is related to their history, idiosyncrasies, 
socio-economic and cultural aspects. Therefore, there are different public 
policies for herbal products consumed in the region. Mexico has a more specific 
classification of these products. In Canada, all herbal products are classified 
as natural health products and the safety and efficacy must be scientifically 
proven. In the USA, the development of botanical drugs is very recent. In 
particular, both herbal products classified as food supplements in Mexico and 
dietary supplements in the USA may have risks in both safety and efficacy.

Population aging and declining birth rates are key demographic trends of the 
21st century. While the overall life expectancy and healthy life years increase, 
the quality of life and functional capacity worsens due to non-communicable 
diseases strongly related to aging. Therefore, aging citizens are often 
vulnerable to food insecurity. The aim of this paper is to provide insights into 
the physical accessibility of fresh food and possible alternatives within the 
setting of an aging society in Antwerp (Belgium), a metropolitan city at the 
heart of the EU Reference Site 'Three Rivers Food Delta'. We demonstrate that a 
large number of the Antwerp suburban areas in which 15 to 25% of current 
inhabitants are already over 65 years old are confronted with problematic 
physical accessibility of food due to long walking distances to the nearest food 
shop. E-commerce has the potential to provide better access to fresh food. This 
is especially relevant for people with specific needs, such as health-related 
diets, dysphagia, and/or limited mobility. However, e-commerce introduces new 
inequalities, as those who would benefit the most from digital accessibility 
currently use it least. Hence, the organization of fresh food access requires a 
more thoughtful organization of the 'last mile' and possible alternatives to 
home delivery. This makes food accessibility an urgent factor of concern in 
public health and healthy aging in the Antwerp suburban areas.

Older adults and patients with chronic disease presenting with muscle weakness 
or musculoskeletal disorders may benefit from low-load resistance exercise 
(LLRE) with blood flow restriction (BFR). LLRE-BFR has been shown to increase 
muscle size, strength, and endurance comparable to traditional resistance 
exercise but without the use of heavy loads. However, potential negative effects 
from LLRE-BFR present as a barrier to participation and limit its wider use. 
This study examined the perceptual, affective, and cardiovascular responses to a 
bout of LLRE-BFR and compared the responses to LLRE and moderate-load resistance 
exercise (MLRE). Twenty older adults (64.3 ± 4.2 years) performed LLRE-BFR, LLRE 
and MLRE consisting of 4 sets of leg press and knee extension, in a randomised 
crossover design. LLRE-BFR was more demanding than LLRE and MLRE through 
increased pain (p ≤ 0.024, d = 0.8-1.4) and reduced affect (p ≤ 0.048, d = 
-0.5--0.9). Despite this, LLRE-BFR was enjoyed and promoted a positive affective 
response (p ≤ 0.035, d = 0.5-0.9) following exercise comparable to MLRE. This 
study supports the use of LLRE-BFR for older adults and encourages future 
research to examine the safety, acceptability, and efficacy of LLRE-BFR in 
patients with chronic disease.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and multi-systemic autoimmune 
disease, which has a deleterious impact on patients' psychological well-being. 
This paper aims to review the existing literature on empirical research on 
psychological outcomes of SLE and psychological interventions to improve 
well-being in SLE patients. A search of significant English language articles 
was conducted in PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and ResearchGate 
databases. Titles and abstracts were screened for the relevant terms, including 
"systemic lupus erythematosus", "childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus", 
"juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus", "lupus nephritis", and their respective 
synonyms along with "depression", "anxiety", "fatigue", "medical adherence", 
"health-related quality of life", "self-management" or "intervention". The 
articles were evaluated by independent reviewers and the lists of eligible 
publications were compared whilst disagreements were settled by discussion. Of 
the 59 publications sought for retrieval, 35 papers were shortlisted based on 
predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. They were classified according to their 
content and the methodology applied. Research topics including "anxiety and 
depression in SLE" and "self-management interventions for SLE patients" were 
identified and are presented in this review. As the prognosis and life 
expectancy of SLE patients are improving, further research on the psychological 
outcomes of SLE and the evidence-based psychological interventions to improve 
patients' well-being are justified.

Global warming and environmental pollution have created a unique combination of 
abiotic and biotic stresses to zooplankton. However, little information is 
available on the effects of antipsychotic drugs commonly used to treat 
psychosis, such as chlorpromazine (CPZ), on non-target aquatic organisms in 
light of global warming. This study investigated how dopamine concentrations 
(DAC), acute toxicity and chronic toxicity of Brachionus calyciflorus changed in 
response to CPZ and gradually increasing temperatures. The results showed that 
the concentration range of rotifer DAC was 1.06~2.51 ng/g. At 18, 25 and 32 °C, 
the 24 h LC50 was 1.795, 1.242 and 0.833 mg/L, respectively. Compared to the 
control, exposure to CPZ significantly decreased life expectancy at hatching, 
the net reproduction rate, generation time, population growth rate and dopamine 
concentration of B. calyciflorus in all three temperatures (p < 0.05). The 
toxicity of CPZ to rotifers was increased by high temperature. These findings 
indicated that CPZ is highly toxic to rotifers, displaying high ecological risks 
to aquatic ecosystems.

Temporal trends and future expectations of health effects due to high body mass 
index (BMI) remain uncertain in China. The trends of high-BMI-related death in 
China were evaluated and predicted until 2040 using data and methods from the 
Global Burden of Disease study. The absolute numbers and age-standardized rates 
of death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were also calculated by age, 
gender, and cause. From 1990 to 2019, the high-BMI-related death percent, number 
and rate were all significantly increased in China, and death rate may exceed 
that globally in the next 10 years. High BMI caused more deaths and DALYs for 
men than for women, and the gap appeared to increase over time. In 2019, the 
burden of high BMI among ages 0−14 and 15−19 for children and adolescents were 
lower than that among adults (>20 years). The most common cause of death 
associated with high BMI was stroke, followed by ischemic heart disease and 
hypertensive heart disease. High BMI burden is a significant public health 
challenges in China. BMI surveillance and evaluation of evidence-based 
preventive strategies should be immediately initiated in Chinese residents due 
to the rapid increase in the burden of high BMI.
