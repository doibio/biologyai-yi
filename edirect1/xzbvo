fractures impose a tremendous economic burden and these fractures deserve 
attention as they lead to a decrease in mobility with an increase in dependency 
and are associated with a high rate of mortality. To date, little is known about 
potential risk factors for pelvic insufficiency fractures. Furthermore, 
information on clinical outcome is scarce. In view of this rather limited 
knowledge, we aimed to identify potential risk factors for pelvic insufficiency 
fractures and to collect information on their short- and long-term outcomes.
METHODS: Files of all consecutive patients admitted between January 2010 and 
December 2013 for a pelvic insufficiency fracture were enrolled in this study. 
Pelvic fractures that occurred on tumorous bone or after high-energy trauma were 
excluded. Fractures of the pelvis included all pelvic bones except the coccyx. 
For all patients, we recorded clinical and biological parameters available from 
their medical history. For comparison, the same biological and clinical 
parameters were evaluated in an age matched control group of 1083 patients aged 
over 70 who were admitted to our orthopaedic department to undergo knee or hip 
arthroplasty. The statistical analyses used or Fisher test for percentages 
comparison, 2-tailed t-tests and Mann Whitney for mean comparison. To determine 
what factors are predictors and what factors are confounders of pelvic 
insufficiency fractures, multivariate linear regression analysis using the 
fracture as a continuous variable was performed.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients with a pelvic insufficiency fracture were 
identified. Following the Rommens and Hofmann classification for fragility 
fractures of the pelvis (FFP), 51 were FFP Type Ia, 26 were FFP Type IIb lesions 
and 26 were FFP Type IIc. Osteoporosis was found to be significantly associated 
with pelvic insufficiency fractures (p=0.003), as was hypertension (p=0.036), 
diabetes (p=0.021), vitamin D deficiency (p=0.004), hypocalcaemia (p=0.002) and 
nicotine abuse (p=0.0012) after adjustment for possible confounders in the 
multivariate linear regression analysis. Comparing the autonomous state before 
and after pelvic fracture, a high loss of autonomy was observed. Patients 
needing daily assistance nearly doubled their number. Overall mortality was high 
(20%).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study showed multiple risk factors for pelvic 
insufficiency fractures. Some, like vitamin D deficiency, can benefit easy 
preventive measures. Outcome of conservative therapy is poor, with loss of 
social and physical independence and autonomy. The mortality rate is high. 
Efforts should be made in preventing pelvic insufficiency fractures. All 
patients should be treated for the severe osteoporosis being associated with 
these fracture type.

INTRODUCTION: Advances in the treatment of HIV infection in the last decades 
have increased life expectancy of these patients and raise the question of what 
kind of effect chronic infection and its treatment might exert on the behavior 
of age-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases.
PATIENT DATA: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients' records to 
assess the frequency of the association between HIV infection and parkinsonian 
symptoms in our hospital population. Among 249 records we identified four 
individuals with reported parkinsonian symptoms initiated after HIV diagnosis. 
Three of them had no other identifiable cause of secondary parkinsonism. All had 
symptom onset before the age of 60. Based on this study sample one could 
estimate an incidence rate of nearly 101 per 100.000 person/year, which is 
similar to the risk of Parkinson's disease in the general population above 70 
years.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that HIV infected individuals might be at a 
higher risk for developing parkinsonism as a manifestation of early 
neurodegeneration. Prospective and larger studies are needed to address this 
particular association and its characteristics.

Panel count data occur in many clinical and observational studies, and in many 
situations, the observation process may be informative and also there may exist 
a terminal event such as death which stops the follow-up. In this article, we 
propose a new joint model for the analysis of panel count data in the presence 
of both an informative observation process and a dependent terminal event via 
two latent variables. For the inference on the proposed models, a class of 
estimating equations is developed and the resulting estimators are shown to be 
consistent and asymptotically normal. In addition, a lack-of-fit test is 
provided for assessing the adequacy of the models. Simulation studies suggest 
that the proposed approach works well for practical situations. A real example 
from a bladder cancer clinical trial is used to illustrate the proposed methods.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the Give-it-a-Go programme, 
which offers free leisure centre memberships to physically inactive members of 
the public in a single London Borough receiving state benefits.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to analyse lifetime 
costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 1025 people recruited to the 
intervention versus no intervention. In the intervention group, people were 
offered 4 months of free membership at a leisure centre. Physical activity 
levels were assessed at 0 and 4 months using the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (IPAQ). Higher levels of physical activity were assumed to 
decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus type 
II, as well as improve mental health. Costs were assessed from a National Health 
Service (NHS) perspective. Uncertainty was assessed using one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: One-hundred fifty nine participants (15.5 %) completed the programme by 
attending the leisure centre for 4 months. Compared with no intervention, Give 
it a Go increased costs by £67.25 and QALYs by 0.0033 (equivalent to 1.21 days 
in full health) per recruited person. The incremental costs per QALY gained were 
£20,347. The results were highly sensitive to the magnitude of mental health 
gain due to physical activity and the duration of the effect of the programme 
(1 year in the base case analysis). When the mental health gain was omitted from 
the analysis, the incremental cost per QALY gained increased to almost £1.5 
million. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the incremental costs per 
QALY gained were below £20,000 in 39 % of the 5000 simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Give it a Go did not significantly increase life-expectancy, but 
had a positive influence on quality of life due to the mental health gain of 
physical activity. If the increase in physical activity caused by Give it a Go 
lasts for more than 1 year, the programme would be cost-effective given a 
willingness to pay for a QALY of £20,000.

OBJECTIVE: This second article of a series of four is aimed to inform dental 
practitioners about the relevance to provide more formal analysis of economic 
resources when helping patients make clinical decisions.
METHODS: The following methods of health economic evaluation are described: 
Cost-effectiveness-analysis (CEA), cost-utility-analysis (CUA) and 
cost-benefit-analysis (CBA). CEA compares the effectiveness of different 
interventions usually based on specific clinical outcome measures, for example 
pocket depth reduction. CUA evaluates the effectiveness of therapies by taking 
into account more generic health outcome measures such as quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) is based on measuring patients' 
actual willingness to pay. Cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) is based on measuring 
patients' actual willingness to pay, and it offers a method of economic 
evaluation that values all benefits against all costs. In other words, the total 
costs of a specific intervention are subtracted from the value of benefits 
related to that intervention.
RESULTS: This article reported common methods of health economic evaluation that 
could be taken into account throughout clinical decision-making. Decision makers 
(patients, practitioners, health policy) should be adequately informed about 
costs and health outcomes associated with the various therapeutic alternatives 
in order to act responsibly within scenarios of resource scarcity. Economic 
evaluations can be informative with respect to whether or not the health 
outcomes outweigh the costs of an intervention, and hence provide a 
decision-making tool for decision makers considering treatment alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: The information provided here may help decision makers (patients, 
practitioners, health policy) to understand economic considerations as an 
essential component of the decision-making process. Carefulness is advised with 
regard to interpreting the results from economic evaluation studies.

Several different lysosomal storage diseases, mainly mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) 
type I, II, and VI, are complicated by severe obstruction of the upper airways, 
tracheobronchial malacia, and/or stenosis of the lower airways. Although enzyme 
replacement therapies (ERTs) are available, the impact of these on 
tracheobronchial alterations has not been reported. By extending the life 
expectancy of MPS patients with ERTs, airway problems may become more prevalent 
at advanced ages. These airway abnormalities can result in severe, potentially 
fatal, difficulties during anesthetic procedures. Usually, upper airway 
obstruction is treated by tracheostomy. However, with lower airway malacia 
and/or stenosis, there are no procedures available to date to address these 
difficulties. We report the first cases using a new technique of tracheal 
stenting in patients with MPS type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) and type II 
(Hunter syndrome) who had almost complete tracheal occlusion and total airway 
collapse. An updated literature review is also reported.

BACKGROUND: The burden of injury is increasing worldwide; planning for its 
impact on population health and health systems is urgently needed, particularly 
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to model the 
burden of fractures and project costs to eliminate avertable fracture-related 
disability-adjusted life-years (i.e., a measure of overall disease burden, 
expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or premature 
death; DALYs) in Sierra Leone and Nepal.
METHODS: Data from nationwide, cluster-randomized, community-based surveys of 
surgical need in Sierra Leone and Nepal were used to model the incidence and 
prevalence of fractures stratified by met and unmet needs. DALYs incurred from 
treated and untreated fractures were estimated. Additionally, the investment 
necessary to eliminate avertable incident fracture DALYs was modeled through 
2025 using published cost per DALY averted estimates.
RESULTS: The incidence of treated and untreated fractures in Sierra Leone was 
570 and 1004 fractures per 100,000 persons, respectively. There could be more 
than 2 million avertable fracture DALYs by 2025 in Sierra Leone and 2.5 million 
in Nepal requiring an estimated US$ 4,049,932 (range US$ 2,011,500-6,088,364) 
and US$ 4,962,402 (range US$ 2,464,701-7,460,103) to address this excess burden, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a significant burden of untreated fractures in 
both countries, and an opportunity to avert more than 4.5 million DALYs in 10 
years in a cost-effective manner. Prioritizing funding mechanisms for 
orthopaedic care and implants should be considered given the large burden of 
untreated fractures found in both countries and the long-term savings and 
functional benefit from properly treated fractures.

Comment in
    Atherosclerosis. 2016 Sep;252:188-189.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Untreated individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia 
(FH) are at increased risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a normal life expectancy. A recent 
survey commissioned by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported a 
lack of awareness of FH in the general population. We conducted a survey to 
assess knowledge among healthcare professionals involved in the assessment and 
management of cardiovascular risk and disease in the United Kingdom.
METHODS: A survey designed to assess knowledge of diagnostic criteria, risk 
assessment, the role of cascade screening, and management options for patients 
with FH was distributed to 1000 healthcare professionals (response rate 44.3%). 
The same survey was redistributed following attendance at an educational session 
on FH.
RESULTS: 151 respondents (40.5%) reported having patients under their care who 
would meet the diagnostic criteria for FH, but just 61.4% recognized that 
cardiovascular risk estimation tools cannot be applied in FH, and only 22.3% 
understood the relative risk of premature CVD compared to the general 
population. Similarly, just 65.9% were aware of recommendations regarding 
cascade screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and associated risk of FH continue to be 
underestimated, and knowledge of diagnostic criteria and treatment options is 
suboptimal. These results support the recent Consensus Statement of the EAS and 
production of quality standards by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence. Further work is required to formulate interventions to improve FH 
awareness and knowledge, and to determine the effect these interventions have on 
patient outcomes.

Individualised and personalised QALYs in exceptional treatment decisions.

Heale W.

Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are used to determine how to allocate 
resources to health programmes or to treatments within those programmes in order 
to gain maximum utility from those limited, shared healthcare resources. 
However, if we use those same population- based QALYs when faced with individual 
treatment decisions we may act unjustly in relation to that individual or in 
relation to the wider population. A treatment with a population-based 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio beyond our willingness to pay threshold may 
be denied to a patient even if, for that particular patient, the QALYs gained 
for the cost would fall within that threshold. When considering individual 
cases, it is proposed that we should take an individualised approach to the cost 
of treatment and response to treatment ('individualised QALYs') and a 
personalised approach to the valuation of health states ('personalised QALYs'). 
Only if we do this, can we maximise utility and give the patient a fair 
opportunity to benefit. Individualised and personalised QALYs also allow us to 
express patient choice and religious treatment preferences in terms of utility. 
Individualised and personalised QALYs are explored in the context of individual 
funding requests in the National Health Service. In preference to the concept of 
'clinical exceptionality', individualised and personalised QALYs provide the 
potential for better and more consistent decisions and improved utility. Rather 
than treating unequal patients as if they were equal, individualised and 
personalised QALYs promote fair and unequal access to resources for some of our 
most unequal patients. Potential challenges are also considered.

OBJECTIVES: A disproportionate number of homicides have caused Mexican life 
expectancy to stagnate during the new millennium. No efforts currently exist to 
quantify the harm of violent acts on the lives of the general population. We 
quantified the impact of perceived vulnerability on life expectancy.
METHODS: Three Mexican national surveys on perceptions of public safety, life 
tables, and crime and vital statistics (2000-2014) were used. Prevalence rates 
of vulnerability/safety by age and sex were obtained from surveys at 2 different 
levels: federal state and home. The Sullivan method was used to estimate life 
expectancy lived with and without vulnerability for Mexican women and men.
RESULTS: Overall life expectancy at age 20 stagnated between 2005 and 2014 for 
females and males; yet, there was an increase of 40% and 70% in average number 
of years lived with vulnerability at the state and home levels, respectively. In 
2014, female life expectancy at age 20 was 59.5 years (95% CI 59.0 to 60.1); 71% 
of these years (42.3 years, 41.6 to 43.0) were spent with perceived 
vulnerability of violence taking place in the state and 26% at the home 
(15.3 years, 15 to 15.8). For males, life expectancy at age 20 was 54.5 years 
(53.7 to 55.1); 64% of these years (34.6 years, 34.0 to 35.4) were lived with 
perceived vulnerability of violence at the state and 20% at the home 
(11.1 years, 10.8 to 11.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of years lived with perceived vulnerability among 
Mexicans has increased by 30.5 million person-years over the last 10 years. If 
perceived vulnerability remains at its 2014 level, the average Mexican adults 
would be expected to live a large fraction of his/her life with perceived 
vulnerability of violence. Acts of violence continue to rise in the country and 
they should be addressed as a major public health issue before they become 
endemic.

The Asian citrus psyllid preferentially feeds and exclusively reproduces on 
young, newly emerged flush shoots of citrus. Asian citrus psyllid nymphs feed 
and complete their life stages on these flush shoots. Recent studies conducted 
under greenhouse conditions have shown that the transmission rates of 
'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas), the putative causal agent of 
huanglongbing disease of citrus, are enhanced when flush shoots are present. 
However, it is unclear if CLas acquisition by migrant adult Asian citrus 
psyllids is similarly enhanced. To address this knowledge gap, cohorts of Asian 
citrus psyllid adults were allowed 1-wk acquisition access period (AAP) on 
flushing and nonflushing shoots of qPCR-tested symptomatic (CLas+) and 
asymptomatic (CLas-) 10-yr-old sweet orange trees under field conditions. After 
the AAP, they were tested for CLas by qPCR. Progeny Asian citrus psyllid adults 
that emerged 4 wk post-AAP were similarly retrieved and tested. Eighty percent 
of flushing and 30% of nonflushing CLas+ trees produced infective Asian citrus 
psyllid adults, indicating that flush shoots have greater potential to be 
inoculum sources for CLas acquisition. Concomitantly, 21.1% and 6.0% infective 
adults were retrieved, respectively, from flushing and nonflushing CLas+ trees, 
indicating that Asian citrus psyllid adults acquire CLas more efficiently from 
flush shoots relative to mature shoots. In addition, 12.1% of infective Asian 
citrus psyllid adult progeny were obtained from 70% of flushing CLas+ trees. 
Significantly lower mean Ct values were also obtained from infective adults 
retrieved from flushing relative to nonflushing trees. The results underscore 
the role of flush shoots in CLas acquisition and the need to protect citrus 
trees from Asian citrus psyllid infestations during flush cycles.

Commercial fishery processing results in discards up to 50% of the raw material, 
consisting of scales, shells, frames, backbones, viscera, head, liver, skin, 
belly flaps, dark muscle, roe, etc. Besides, fishing operations targeted at 
popular fish and shellfish species also result in landing of sizeable quantity 
of by-catch, which are not of commercial value because of their poor consumer 
appeal. Sensitivity to rapid putrefaction of fishery waste has serious adverse 
impact on the environment, which needs remedial measures. Secondary processing 
of the wastes has potential to generate a number of valuable by-products such as 
proteins, enzymes, carotenoids, fat, and minerals, besides addressing 
environmental hazards. Fishery wastes constitute good sources of enzymes such as 
proteases, lipases, chitinase, alkaline phosphatase, transglutaminase, 
hyaluronidase, acetyl glycosaminidase, among others. These enzymes can have 
diverse applications in the seafood industry, which encompass isolation and 
modification of proteins and marine oils, production of bioactive peptides, 
acceleration of traditional fermentation, peeling and deveining of shellfish, 
scaling of finfish, removal of membranes from fish roe, extraction of flavors, 
shelf life extension, texture modification, removal of off-odors, and for 
quality control either directly or as components of biosensors. Enzymes from 
fish and shellfish from cold habitats are particularly useful since they can 
function comparatively at lower temperatures thereby saving energy and 
protecting the food products. Potentials of these applications are briefly 
discussed.

AIM: To identify the optimal strategy for gastric cancer (GC) prevention by 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)-based 
preventive strategies.
METHODS: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Adopting a 
healthcare payer's perspective, Markov models simulated the clinical experience 
of the target population (Singaporean Chinese 50-69 years old) undergoing 
endoscopic screening, endoscopic surveillance and usual care of do-nothing. The 
screening strategy examined the cohort every alternate year whereas the 
surveillance strategy provided annual EGD only to people with precancerous 
lesions. For each strategy, discounted lifetime costs ($) and quality adjusted 
life years (QALY) were estimated and compared to generate incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to identify influential parameters and quantify the 
impact of model uncertainties.
RESULTS: Annual EGD surveillance with an ICER of $34 200/QALY was deemed 
cost-effective for GC prevention within the Singapore healthcare system. To 
inform implementation, the models identified six influential factors and their 
respective thresholds, namely discount rate (<4.20%), age of starting 
surveillance (>51.6 years), proportion of program cost in delivering endoscopy 
(<65%), cost of follow-up EGD (<$484), utility of stage 1 GC patients (>0.72) 
and odds ratio of GC for high-risk subjects (>3.93). The likelihood that 
surveillance is the most cost-effective strategy is 69.5% accounting for model 
uncertainties.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surveillance of gastric premalignancies can be a 
cost-effective strategy for GC prevention. Its implementation requires careful 
assessment on factors influencing the actual cost-effectiveness.

AIM: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease leading 
to joint damage, functional disability, poor quality of life and shortened life 
expectancy. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are a principal strategy to 
improve outcomes. To provide best practices in the diagnosis and management of 
patients with RA, the Thai Rheumatism Association (TRA) developed scientifically 
sound and clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for general 
practitioners, internists, orthopedists, and physiatrists.
METHODS: Thirty-seven rheumatologists from across Thailand formulated 18 
clinically relevant questions: three for diagnosis, 10 for treatments, four for 
monitoring, and one for referral. A bibliographic team systematically reviewed 
the relevant literature on these topics up to December 2013. A set of 
recommendations was proposed based on the results of systematic reviews combined 
with expert opinions. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and 
recommendations using the nominal group technique.
RESULTS: A set of recommendations was proposed. For diagnosis, either American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 
2010 classification criteria can be applied. For treatment, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoid, and disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs, including antimalarials, methotrexate and sulfasalazine are recommended. 
Physiotherapy should be suggested to all patients. Tight control strategy and 
monitoring for efficacy and side effects of treatments, as well as indications 
for referral to a rheumatologist are provided.
CONCLUSIONS: These evidence-based recommendations provide practical guidance for 
diagnosis, fundamental management and referral of patients with RA for 
non-rheumatologists. However, it should be incorporated with clinical judgments 
and decisions about care for each individual patient.

Researchers and policymakers have long been interested in developing simple 
decision rules to aid in determining whether an intervention is, or is not, 
cost-effective. In global health, interventions that impose costs per 
disability-adjusted life year averted less than three and one times gross 
domestic product per capita are often considered cost-effective and very 
cost-effective, respectively. This article explores the conceptual foundation 
and derivation of these thresholds. Its goal is to promote understanding of how 
these thresholds were derived and their implications, as well as to suggest 
options for improvement. These thresholds are intended to reflect the monetary 
value of the benefits to affected individuals, based on their preferences for 
spending on health vs spending on other goods and services. However, the current 
values were not rigorously derived, which means that their application may lead 
to inappropriate conclusions regarding which interventions should be adopted as 
well as misallocation of resources across health and other investments. 
Improving the basis for these cost-effectiveness thresholds is of particular 
importance in low- and middle-income countries, given the limited resources 
available and the significant needs of their populations.

Dietary methionine restriction (MR) leads to loss of adiposity, improved insulin 
sensitivity and lifespan extension. The possibility that dietary MR can protect 
the kidney from age-associated deterioration has not been addressed. Aged 
(10-month old) male and female mice were placed on a MR (0.172% methionine) or 
control diet (0.86% methionine) for 8-weeks and blood glucose, renal insulin 
signalling, and gene expression were assessed. Methionine restriction lead to 
decreased blood glucose levels compared to control-fed mice, and enhanced 
insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and S6 in kidneys, indicative of 
improved glucose homeostasis. Increased expression of lipogenic genes and 
downregulation of PEPCK were observed, suggesting that kidneys from MR-fed 
animals are more insulin sensitive. Interestingly, renal gene expression of the 
mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1 was upregulated in MR-fed animals, as were 
the anti-ageing and renoprotective genes Sirt1, FGF21, klotho, and β-klotho. 
This was associated with alterations in renal histology trending towards reduced 
frequency of proximal tubule intersections containing vacuoles in mice that had 
been on dietary MR for 190days compared to control-fed mice, which exhibited a 
pre-diabetic status. Our results indicate that dietary MR may offer therapeutic 
potential in ameliorating the renal functional decline related to ageing and 
other disorders associated with metabolic dysfunction by enhancing renal insulin 
sensitivity and renoprotective gene expression.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the data on burden of female breast cancer in China.
METHODS: The data from Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report 2012, three 
national death cause surveys in China, Disease Surveillance Points system(DSP), 
China Health Statistics Yearbook, GLOBOCAN 2012, Cancer Incidence in Five 
Continents(CI5), WHO Mortality Database and Global Burden of Disease(GBD)2013 
were used to extract the incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life 
years(DALY)of female breast cancer and analyze related trends in China.
RESULTS: The data from three national death cause surveys showed that the crude 
mortality of breast cancer doubled from year 1973-1975 to year 2004-2005, the 
increase was higher in urban area(127.4%)than in rural area(75.2%). WHO 
Mortality Database showed that average annual percentage change(AAPC)of breast 
cancer crude mortality increased by 3.1%(P<0.05)from 1987 to 2000, and China 
Health Statistics Yearbook showed that the AAPC in urban females increased by 
2.7% from 2002 to 2013(P<0.05), whereas the AAPC in rural females showed no 
significant change(P>0.05). It was estimated by GLOBOCAN 2012 that in 2012 the 
age-standardized incidence and age-standardized mortality of breast cancer in 
China was 22.1 per 100 000 and 5.4 per 100 000, respectively. The age-specific 
incidence began to increase obviously at age of 40 years and peaked at age 45-59 
years(GLOBOCAN 2012). Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report 2012 showed that 
breast cancer incidence and mortality were 2-fold and 1.5-fold higher in urban 
females than in rural females in 2009. It was estimated that the breast cancer 
case number and death number in females in China would increase to 251 600 and 
75 900, respectively, more increose in age group ≥65 years. Only GBD 2013 
reported DALY, the DALY caused by breast cancer in China was 1 666.0 thousand in 
2013, accounting for 12.7% of global DALY, and increased by 56.7% from 1990(1 
062.6 thousand), the peak age-specific DALY rate was at 50 to 59 years, and 
national average ratio of years lived with disability(YLD)was 8.7%(ranging from 
8.1% to 9.0% at provincial level).
CONCLUSIONS: Burden of disease caused by female breast cancer is becoming 
increasingly severe in China, especially in urban areas. It is necessary to 
strengthen the population-based prevention and control programs and further 
studies may focus on DALY.

Object. The aim of this study was to analyze a series of 28 patients with 
acromegaly who underwent a multimodal surgical, medical and radiosurgical 
therapy, with a special attention to the advantages, complications, and 
predictive factors of a successful outcome. Methods. 28 consecutive cases of 
GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, who underwent transsphenoidal endoscopic or 
microscopic surgery, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2014 were 
retrospectively reviewed. Tumors were classified according to the diameter, 
measured on MRI, as micro- or macroadenomas, and parasellar (cavernous sinus) 
tumor extension was analyzed based on the Knosp grading score. The mean 
follow-up period was of 18.4 months. Criteria justifying the complete hormonal 
remission were preoperative basal serum GH < 2.5 μg/ L, preoperative nadirGH < 1 
ng/ L after OGTT and normal preoperative IGF-I levels age and sex-matched. 
Results. An overall complete hormonal remission rate was achieved in 64.3% of 
the patients. The remission rate was higher in patients with microadenomas 
(77.8%) than in those with macroadenomas (57.9%). A number of predictive 
factors, which might have interfered with the hormonal remission rate from a 
statistical, clinical and paraclinical point of view, were identified: tumor 
size (r = 0.625), preoperative GH serum levels (r = -0.517), cavernous sinus 
extension was quantified according to Knosp grading score (r = 0.469) and the 
degree of tumor subtotal resection (r = 0.598). Conclusions. Favorable hormonal 
and visual remission rates can be achieved after transsphenoidal resection of 
GH-secreting pituitary adenomas; however, the management remains challenging, 
the increased surgical experience being important for higher cure rates. If a 
biochemical hormonal cure is not achieved postoperatively, adjuvant medical or 
radio surgical therapy can be recommended.
