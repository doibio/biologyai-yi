Substantial growth of the population aged 90 years or over has focused interest 
on trends in the functioning and disability of the oldest old, but research 
findings are scarce and they vary. In the Vitality 90+ Study, we evaluated 
overall, gender-specific, and age-specific trends in disability among total 
cohorts of people aged 90 years or older in the city of Tampere, Finland, in the 
years 2001, 2003, and 2007. The size of the target population ranged from 1113 
to 1146 and the participation rate from 79 to 86%. The participants were asked 
whether they were able to get in and out of bed, dress and undress, move about 
indoors, walk 400 m, and use stairs. Independence was defined as being able to 
perform an activity without help. The aggregate outcome measures included 
independence in all five activities, dependence in one to four activities, 
dependence in all five activities (severe dependence), and a disability score. 
In analyses taking into account the within subject associations which resulted 
due to those who participated in several years, and proxy respondents, no 
overall or gender-specific trend was found in any of the independence or 
dependence estimates. In each year, independence decreased clearly by increasing 
age. Our results imply stable disability levels in nonagenarians in a population 
with increasing life expectancy and improving survival until the age of 90. 
Longer-time series are needed to confirm the trends.

Leaf variegation is often the focus of plant breeding. Here, we studied a 
variegated mutant of Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana, which is usually 
used as a parent of horticultural breeding, to understand its anatomic and 
genetic regulatory mechanisms in variegation. Chloroplasts with well-organized 
thylakoids and starch grains were found only in the mesophyll cells of green 
sectors but not of yellow sectors, confirming that the variegation belongs to 
the chlorophyll type. The two-dimensional electrophoresis and LC/MS/MS also 
reveal differential expressions of PsbP and PsbO between the green and yellow 
leaf sectors. Full-length cDNA sequencing revealed that mutant transcripts were 
caused by intron retention. When conditioning on the total RNA expression, we 
found that the functional transcript of PsbO and mutant transcript of PsbP are 
higher expressed in the yellow sector than in the green sector, suggesting that 
the post-transcriptional regulation of PsbO and PsbP differentiates the 
performance between green and yellow sectors. Because PsbP plays an important 
role in the stability of thylakoid folding, we suggest that the negative 
regulation of PsbP may inhibit thylakoid development in the yellow sectors. This 
causes chlorophyll deficiency in the yellow sectors and results in leaf 
variegation. We also provide evidence of the link of virus CymMV and the 
formation of variegation according to the differential expression of CymMV 
between green and yellow sectors.

RATIONAL, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: The Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a licensed 
intensive home visiting intervention developed in the United States. It has been 
provided in England by the Department of Health since 2006. The Building Blocks 
trial assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FNP in England.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis (National Health Service (NHS) 
perspective) alongside the Building Blocks trial (over 2.5 y). The analysis was 
conducted in accordance with National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence (NICE) reference case standards. Health-related quality of life was 
elicited from mothers using the EQ-5D-3L. Resource-use data were collected from 
self-reported questionnaires, Hospital Episode Statistics, general practitioner 
records and the central Department of Health FNP database. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3.5%. The base case 
analysis used an intention to treat approach on the imputed dataset using 
multiple imputation.
RESULTS: The FNP intervention costs on average £1812 more per participant 
compared to usual care (95% confidence interval: -£2700; £5744). Incremental 
adjusted mean QALYs are marginally higher for FNP (mean difference 0.0036, 95% 
confidence interval: -0.017; 0.025). The probability of FNP being cost-effective 
is less than 20% given the current NICE willingness to pay threshold of £20 000 
per additional QALY. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Given the absence of significant benefits of FNP in terms of the 
primary outcomes of the trial and only marginal maternal QALY gains, FNP does 
not represent a cost-effective intervention when compared with existing services 
already offered to young pregnant women.

INTRODUCTION: Scleredema of Buschke is a rare connective tissue disorder 
presenting with woody thickening and induration of the nuchal and shoulder 
regions resulting in progressive decrease in the range of motion of the neck. 
Treatment options include several forms of systemic therapy with variable 
results. Local radiation therapy (RT) is often thought of as a secondary form of 
therapy. Few reports exist in the literature about the durability of its 
benefit, however. Here, we present a case report with the longest known 
follow-up after primary treatment with electron beam RT.
METHODS: The patient was treated using 8-MeV en face electrons with 2000 cGy in 
10 fractions with 2 separate but matched electron fields. The treatment fields 
included the posterior neck from the occiput superiorly to the mid-thoracic 
spine inferiorly with the lateral borders extending to the scapulae. The patient 
received no additional therapy either pre- or post-RT. Clinical follow-up was 
obtained at regular intervals. Published literature regarding RT for this 
disease was reviewed and consolidated.
RESULTS: The patient was followed at regular intervals for 6 years with 
significant softening of the plaque starting at 2 months after RT, resulting in 
decrease in plaque size by 50% after 18 months. The patient regained 45° of 
lateral, bidirectional cervical motion from central axis and 50% improvement in 
neck extension that has remained durable 6 years after treatment with no 
additional therapy. Quality of life was restored with a simple nontoxic 
treatment limited to transient, grade 1 fatigue.
CONCLUSION: Scleredema of Buschke is a rare connective tissue disorder commonly 
treated with multimodal therapy, but it can be effectively and durably 
controlled with RT alone. This case report documents the durability of the 
benefit achieved with RT and suggests that RT should be considered earlier in 
the treatment of this disease.

Nusinersen: antisense oligonucleotide to increase SMN protein production in 
spinal muscular atrophy.

Pharmacology, Auckland, New Zealand. dmpaton38@yahoo.ca.

Patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have an autosomal recessive disease 
that limits their ability to produce survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in the 
CNS resulting in progressive wasting of voluntary muscles. Detailed studies over 
several years have demonstrated that phosphorothioate and 2'-O-methoxyethyl- 
modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the ISS-N1 site increase 
SMN2 exon 7 inclusion, thus increasing levels of SMN protein in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, and CNS tissues only 
when administered intrathecally. On a dose basis, nusinersen was found to be the 
most potent ASO for SMN2 splicing correction in the CNS of adult mice. After 
nusinersen was found to increase levels of SMN protein in the CNS of mice and 
subhuman primates without causing significant adverse events, it was advanced 
into clinical studies in patients with SMA. These trials in SMA patients have 
demonstrated significant improvements in various measures of motor function and 
in progression to movement developments not normally seen in SMA patients. In 
addition, there have been significant extensions in life expectancy. These 
findings led to the U.S. and European approval of nusinersen for use in SMA 
patients of all ages.

OBJECTIVE As life expectancy continues to increase, primary degenerative 
sagittal imbalance (PDSI) is diagnosed in an increasing number of elderly 
people. Although corrective surgery for this sagittal deformity is becoming more 
popular, the effectiveness of the procedure remains unclear. The authors aimed 
to collate the available evidence on the effectiveness and complications of 
deformity-correction surgery in patients with PDSI. METHODS The authors carried 
out a meta-analysis of clinical studies regarding deformity correction in 
patients with PDSI. The studies were identified through searches of the PubMed, 
Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Surgery outcomes were evaluated 
and overall treatment effectiveness was assessed in terms of the minimum 
clinically important difference (MCID) in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) values 
and pain levels according to visual analog scale (VAS) scores and in terms of 
restoration of spinopelvic parameters to within a normal range. Data are 
expressed as mean differences with 95% CIs. RESULTS Ten studies comprising 327 
patients were included. The VAS and ODI values improved after 
deformity-correction surgery. The smallest treatment effect exceeded the MCID 
for VAS values (4.15 [95% CI 3.48-4.82]) but not for ODI values (18.11 [95% CI 
10.99-25.23]). At the final follow-up visit, the mean lumbar lordosis angle 
(-38.60° [95% CI -44.19° to -33.01°]), thoracic kyphosis angle (31.10° [95% CI 
24.67°-37.53°]), C-7 sagittal vertical axis (65.00 mm [95% CI 35.27-94.72 mm]), 
and pelvic tilt angle (30.82° [95% CI 24.41°-37.23°]) remained outside their 
normal ranges. Meta-regression analyses revealed a significant effect of ODI 
change in relation to lumbar lordosis change (p = 0.004). After a mean of 2 
years after deformity correction, the mean lumbar lordosis angle and C-7 
sagittal vertical axis decreased by 5.82° and 38.91 mm, respectively, and the 
mean thoracic kyphosis angle increased by 4.7°. The incidences of proximal 
junctional kyphosis and pseudarthrosis were 23.7% and 12.8%, respectively. 
CONCLUSIONS Deformity correction substantially relieves back pain for about 2 
years in adult patients with PDSI. Sufficient surgical restoration of lumbar 
lordosis can lead to substantial improvement in patient disability and reduced 
decompensation. Deformity correction represents a viable therapeutic option for 
patients with PDSI, but further technical advancements are necessary to achieve 
sufficient lumbar lordosis and reduce complication rates.

Tobacco, illicit drugs use and risk of cardiovascular disease in patients living 
with HIV.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a strong link between HIV, smoking and illicit 
drugs. This association could be clinically relevant as it may potentiate the 
risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The purpose of this review is to bring 
readers up to date on issues concerning the cardiovascular risk associated with 
tobacco and illicit drugs in patients living with HIV (PLHIV), examining the 
studies related to this topic published in the last year.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a strong association between smoking and 
atherosclerotic disease in PLHIV, reducing life expectancy secondary to CVD by 
up to 6 years. Illicit drugs were associated with increased risk of 
atherosclerotic problems but to a lesser extent than smoking. A significant 
association of drugs such as cocaine with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis 
been demonstrated. The relation of marijuana, heroin and amphetamines with 
atherosclerosis generates more controversy. However, those drugs are associated 
with cardiovascular morbidity, independently of smoking and other traditional 
risk factors.
SUMMARY: Tobacco and illicit drugs are linked to CVD in HIV patients. This leads 
to the need to create special programs to address the addiction to smoking and 
illicit drugs, in order to mitigate their consequences and reduce cardiovascular 
risk.

The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is a genetically validated pain target 
under investigation for the development of analgesics. A therapeutic with a less 
frequent dosing regimen would be of value for treating chronic pain; however 
functional NaV1.7 targeting antibodies are not known. In this report, we 
describe NaV1.7 inhibitory peptide-antibody conjugates as an alternate construct 
for potential prolonged channel blockade through chemical derivatization of 
engineered antibodies. We previously identified NaV1.7 inhibitory peptide GpTx-1 
from tarantula venom and optimized its potency and selectivity. Tethering GpTx-1 
peptides to antibodies bifunctionally couples FcRn-based antibody recycling 
attributes to the NaV1.7 targeting function of the peptide warhead. Herein, we 
conjugated a GpTx-1 peptide to specific engineered cysteines in a carrier 
anti-2,4-dinitrophenol monoclonal antibody using polyethylene glycol linkers. 
The reactivity of 13 potential cysteine conjugation sites in the antibody 
scaffold was tuned using a model alkylating agent. Subsequent reactions with the 
peptide identified cysteine locations with the highest conversion to desired 
conjugates, which blocked NaV1.7 currents in whole cell electrophysiology. 
Variations in attachment site, linker, and peptide loading established design 
parameters for potency optimization. Antibody conjugation led to in vivo 
half-life extension by 130-fold relative to a nonconjugated GpTx-1 peptide and 
differential biodistribution to nerve fibers in wild-type but not NaV1.7 
knockout mice. This study describes the optimization and application of antibody 
derivatization technology to functionally inhibit NaV1.7 in engineered and 
neuronal cells.

Osteoporosis, a metabolic disease characterized by low bone mass, deterioration 
of the bone tissue microarchitecture and increased susceptibility to fractures, 
is commonly regarded as a women's health problem. This point of view is based on 
the fact that compared with men, women have lower bone mineral density and 
longer lifespans and lose bone mass faster, especially after menopause, due to a 
marked decrease in serum estrogen levels. However, in the last 20 years, 
osteoporosis in men has become recognized as a public health problem due to the 
occurrence of an increasingly higher number of fragility fractures. 
Approximately 30% of all hip fractures occur in men. Recent studies show that 
the probability of fracture due to hip, vertebral or wrist fragility in 
Caucasian men older than fifty years, for the rest of their lives, is 
approximately 13% versus a 40% probability of fragility fractures in women. Men 
show bone mass loss and fractures later than women. Although older men have a 
higher risk of fracture, approximately half of all hip fractures occur before 
the age of 80. Life expectancy is increasing for both sexes in Brazil and 
worldwide, albeit at a higher rate for men than for women. This Guideline was 
based on a systematic review of the literature on the prevalence, etiology, 
diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in men.

BACKGROUND: A proactive integrated approach has shown to preserve daily 
functioning among older people in the community. The aim is to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a proactive integrated primary care program.
METHODS: Economic evaluation embedded in a single-blind, 3-armed, 
cluster-randomized controlled trial with 12 months' follow-up in 39 general 
practices in the Netherlands. General practices were randomized to one of 3 
trial arms: (1) an electronic frailty screening instrument using routine medical 
record data followed by standard general practitioner (GP) care; (2) this 
screening instrument followed by a nurse-led care program; or (3) usual care. 
Health resource utilization data were collected using electronic medical records 
and questionnaires. Associated costs were calculated. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken. The incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year was calculated comparing proactive screening arm with 
usual care, and screening plus nurse-led care arm with usual care, as well as 
the screening arm with screening plus nurse-led care arm.
RESULTS: Out of 7638 potential participants, 3092 (40.5%) older adults 
participated. Whereas effect differences were minor, the total costs per patient 
were lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care. The probability 
of cost-effectiveness at €20,000 per QALY threshold was 87% and 91% for 
screening plus GP care versus usual care and for screening plus nurse-led care 
compared to usual care, respectively. For screening plus nurse-led care vs 
screening plus standard GP care, the probability was 55%.
CONCLUSION: A proactive screening intervention has a high probability of being 
cost-effective compared to usual care. The combined intervention showed less 
value for money.

Australian Aboriginal group over a recent 50-year period.
DESIGN: A retrospective observational study, from 1960 to 2010, of deaths and 
people starting dialysis, using data from local clinic, parish, dialysis and 
birthweight registers.
SETTING: A remote island community in the Top End of Australia's Northern 
Territory, where a Catholic mission was established in 1911. The estimated 
Aboriginal population was about 800 in 1960 and 2260 in 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: All Aboriginal residents of this community whose deaths had been 
recorded.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual frequencies and rates of terminal events (deaths and 
dialysis starts) by age group and cause of death.
RESULTS: Against a background of high rates of low birth weight, 223 deaths in 
infants and children and 934 deaths in adults (age > 15 years) were recorded; 
88% were of natural causes. Most deaths in the 1960s were in infants and 
children. However, over time these fell dramatically, across the birthweight 
spectrum, while adult deaths progressively increased. The leading causes of 
adult natural deaths were chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and, more 
recently, renal failure, and rates were increased twofold in those of low birth 
weight. However, rates of natural adult deaths have been falling briskly since 
1986, most markedly among people of age ≥45 years. The population is increasing 
and its age structure is maturing.
CONCLUSIONS: The changes in death profiles, the expression of the Barker 
hypothesis and the ongoing increases in adult life expectancy reflect 
epidemiological and health transitions of astonishing rapidity. These probably 
flow from advances in public health policy and healthcare delivery, as well as 
improved inter-sectoral services, which are all to be celebrated. Other remote 
communities in Australia are experiencing the same phenomena, and similar events 
are well advanced in many developing countries.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2015 and the WHO 2013 diagnostic thresholds 
for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
SETTING: The analysis was from the perspective of the National Health Service in 
England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: 6221 patients from four of the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse 
Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study centres (two UK, two Australian), 6308 patients 
from the Atlantic Diabetes in Pregnancy study and 12 755 patients from UK 
clinical practice.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES PLANNED: The incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), net monetary benefit (NMB) and the 
probability of being cost-effective at CE thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per 
QALY.
RESULTS: In a population of pregnant women from the four HAPO study centres and 
using NICE-defined risk factors for GDM, diagnosing GDM using NICE 2015 criteria 
had an NMB of £239 902 (relative to no treatment) at a CE threshold of £30 000 
per QALY compared with WHO 2013 criteria, which had an NMB of £186 675. NICE 
2015 criteria had a 51.5% probability of being cost-effective compared with the 
WHO 2013 diagnostic criteria, which had a 27.6% probability of being 
cost-effective (no treatment had a 21.0% probability of being cost-effective). 
For women without NICE risk factors in this population, the NMBs for NICE 2015 
and WHO 2013 criteria were both negative relative to no treatment and no 
treatment had a 78.1% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The NICE 2015 diagnostic criteria for GDM can be considered 
cost-effective relative to the WHO 2013 alternative at a CE threshold of £30 000 
per QALY. Universal screening for GDM was not found to be cost-effective 
relative to screening based on NICE risk factors.

Developing core economic outcome sets for asthma studies: a protocol for a 
systematic review.

INTRODUCTION: Core outcome sets are standardised lists of outcomes, which should 
be measured and reported in all clinical studies of a specific condition. This 
study aims to develop core outcome sets for economic evaluations in asthma 
studies. Economic outcomes include items such as costs, resource use or 
quality-adjusted life years. The starting point in developing core outcome sets 
will be conducting a systematic literature review to establish a preliminary 
list of reporting items to be considered for inclusion in the core outcome set.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct literature searches of peer-reviewed 
studies published from January 1990 to January 2017. These will include any 
comparative or observational studies (including economic models) and systematic 
reviews reporting economic outcomes. All identified economic outcomes will be 
tabulated together with the major study characteristics, such as population, 
study design, the nature and intensity of the intervention, mode of data 
collection and instrument(s) used to derive an outcome. We will undertake a 
'realist synthesis review' to analyse the identified economic outcomes. The 
outcomes will be summarised in the context of evaluation perspectives, types of 
economic evaluation and methodological approaches. Parallel to undertaking a 
systematic review, we will conduct semistructured interviews with stakeholders 
(including people with personal experience of asthma, health professionals, 
researchers and decision makers) in order to explore additional outcomes which 
have not been considered, or used, in published studies. The list of outcomes 
generated from the systematic review and interviews with stakeholders will form 
the basis of a Delphi survey to refine the identified outcomes into a core 
outcome set.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The review will not involve access to individual-level 
data. Findings from our systematic review will be communicated to a broad range 
of stakeholders including clinical guideline developers, research funders, trial 
registries, ethics committees and other regulators.

It has been proposed that equity may be included in the economic evaluation of 
health services using the 'proportional shortfall' (PS)-the proportion of a 
person's QALY expectation that they would lose because of an illness. The 
present paper reports the results of a population survey designed to test 
whether PS helped to explain people's preferences for health services and 
whether it did this better than the absolute shortfall or the equity related 
variables that PS seeks to replace. Survey respondents were asked to allocate 
100 votes between 13 scenarios and a standard scenario. Variation in the 
allocation of votes was explained by health gain and different combinations of 
the equity variables. Differences in votes for the comparisons were 
significantly related to differences in PS but the relationship was weaker than 
between votes and the age related variables. Cases were identified where PS 
suggested a priority ordering of services which was strongly rejected by 
respondents. It is concluded that the use of PS is unlikely to improve the 
alignment of priorities with public preferences.

For the assessment of value of new therapies in healthcare, Health Technology 
Assessment (HTA) agencies often review the cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Some HTA agencies accept a higher cost per QALY gained when 
treatment is aimed at prolonging survival for patients with a short expected 
remaining lifetime, a so-called end-of-life (EoL) premium. The objective of this 
study is to elicit the existence and size of an EoL premium in cancer. Data was 
collected from 509 individuals in the Swedish general population 20-80 years old 
using a web-based questionnaire. Preferences were elicited using subjective risk 
estimation and the contingent valuation (CV) method. A split-sample design was 
applied to test for order bias. The mean value of a QALY was MSEK4.8 (€528,000), 
and there was an EoL premium of 4-10% at 6 months of expected remaining 
lifetime. Using subjective risk resulted in more robust and valid estimates of 
the value of a QALY. Order of scenarios did not have a significant impact on the 
WTP and the result showed scale sensitivity. Our result provides some support 
for the use of an EoL premium based on individual preferences when expected 
remaining lifetime is short and below 24 months. Furthermore, we find support 
for a value of a QALY that is above the current threshold of several HTA 
agencies.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in terms of 
incidence and mortality. Age is undoubtedly the biggest breast cancer risk 
factor. In this study we examined clinical, histological, and biological 
characteristics and mortality of breast cancer in elderly women along with their 
changes with advancing age.
METHODS: We reviewed 63 original articles published between 2006 and 2016 
concerning women over 70 years with breast cancer.
RESULTS: Compared to patients 70-79 years, patients aged 80 and over had larger 
tumor size with fewer T1 (42.9% vs 57.7%, p < 0.01) and more T2 lesions (43.5% 
vs 33.0%, p < 0.01). Lymph nodes and distant metastases were more frequent, with 
more N + (49.5% vs 44.0%, p < 0.01) and more M1 (8.0% vs 5.9%, p < 0.01). 
Infiltrating mucinous carcinomas were more frequent (4.3% vs 3.7%, p < 0.01). 
Tumors had lower grades, with more grade 1 (23.2% vs 19.8%, p = 0.01) and fewer 
grade 3 (21.5% vs 25.5%, p < 0.01), and were more hormone-sensitive: PR was more 
often expressed (72.6% vs 67.3%, p < 0.01). Lympho-vascular invasion was less 
frequent in the 80 years and over (22.9% vs 29.7%, p = 0.01). Breast 
cancer-specific mortality was higher both at 5 years (25.8% vs 17.2%, p < 0.01) 
and 10 years (32.7% vs 26.6%, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Clinico-pathological characteristics, increased incidence, and 
mortality associated with aging can be explained on one hand by biological 
changes of the breast such as increased estrogen sensitivity, epithelial cell 
alterations, immune senescence, and tumor microenvironment modifications. 
However, sociologic factors such as increased life expectancy, under-treatment, 
late diagnosis, and insufficient individual screening, are also involved.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum, including 
'simple' steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis. 
Increasing prevalence of NAFLD has followed the international rise in obesity 
and lifestyle modification is the mainstay therapy for children. To date, 
pharmacological trials have had varying efficacy but a large number of new 
agents are in early phase trials for adults. Areas covered: This review explores 
the effect of current and potential future paediatric NAFLD treatments in terms 
of histological and biochemical endpoints. The potential for the extension of 
adult treatments to children is discussed, as well as what limits the use of 
certain agents in children. Expert commentary: No drugs have yet to be licenced 
for NAFLD. Trial heterogeneity makes comparison of drugs between studies 
challenging. FXR agonists are yet to be trialled in children but may represent a 
safe and potentially efficacious therapy. Future treatments would likely 
encompass a multimodal approach that may include bariatric surgery.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-study IV was designed to explore whether 
treatment with imatinib (IM) at 400 mg/day (n=400) could be optimized by 
doubling the dose (n=420), adding interferon (IFN) (n=430) or cytarabine (n=158) 
or using IM after IFN-failure (n=128). From July 2002 to March 2012, 1551 newly 
diagnosed patients in chronic phase were randomized into a 5-arm study. The 
study was powered to detect a survival difference of 5% at 5 years. After a 
median observation time of 9.5 years, 10-year overall survival was 82%, 10-year 
progression-free survival was 80% and 10-year relative survival was 92%. 
Survival between IM400 mg and any experimental arm was not different. In a 
multivariate analysis, risk group, major-route chromosomal aberrations, 
comorbidities, smoking and treatment center (academic vs other) influenced 
survival significantly, but not any form of treatment optimization. Patients 
reaching the molecular response milestones at 3, 6 and 12 months had a 
significant survival advantage. For responders, monotherapy with IM400 mg 
provides a close to normal life expectancy independent of the time to response. 
Survival is more determined by patients' and disease factors than by initial 
treatment selection. Although improvements are also needed for refractory 
disease, more life-time can currently be gained by carefully addressing non-CML 
determinants of survival.

Threats posed by stockpiles of expired pharmaceuticals in low- and middle-income 
countries: a Ugandan perspective.

In some low- and middle-income countries, the national stores and public-sector 
health facilities contain large stocks of pharmaceuticals that are past their 
expiry dates. In low-income countries like Uganda, many such stockpiles are the 
result of donations. If not adequately monitored or regulated, expired 
pharmaceuticals may be repackaged and sold as counterfeits or be dumped without 
any thought of the potential environmental damage. The rates of pharmaceutical 
expiry in the supply chain need to be reduced and the disposal of expired 
pharmaceuticals needs to be made both timely and safe. Many low- and
