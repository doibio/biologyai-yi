BACKGROUND: Genital melanoma is a rare but deadly cancer in women and the 
prognosis is often poor.
PURPOSE: This study assesses the impact of possible risk factors on the end 
prognosis of the patients, with the ultimate goal of improving survival of 
disease.
METHODS: This is a report of 6 patients diagnosed and treated as genital 
melanoma. Parameters reviewed included: age at diagnose, presenting symptoms, 
location size and Breslow depth of lesion, stage at diagnose, adjuvant 
therapies, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, metastasis or recurrence in 
follow-up, chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
RESULTS: The mean age at the time of diagnosis, was 44.67 years, the average 
size of lesion was 2.91 cm; the average Breslow depth of lesion was 1.93 mm. The 
mean interval between the onsets of symptoms to diagnosis was 16.7 months; the 
average life expectancy was 23.5 months. There is no significant relationship 
between the initial location of the lesion and prognosis (P: 0.98). Patients 
diagnosed in < 7 months, were in lower stages at diagnose (P: 0.018), and the 
survival of them was better (P: 0.035). Patients diagnosed in early stages had 
better survival at last (P: 0.035) Adjuvant radiotherapy improves survival 
markedly (P: 0.018). Hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy had no significant 
effect on prognosis (P: 0.7). Chemotherapy in metastatic disease had no 
significant effect on prognosis (P: 0.46).
CONCLUSION: The survival markedly improved if the disease diagnosed in a short 
distance from onset of symptoms and specially in early stages. Adjuvant 
radiotherapy can improve the survival significantly, but for the early 
hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy and also for chemotherapy in metastatic 
disease, the impact on prognosis is uncertain, but positive.

INTRODUCTION: Patients who suffer from chronic renal disease face problems in 
many aspects of their life; problems such as physical and social as well as 
mental such as stress, anxiety, depression. In addition, they exhibit an amount 
of spiritual needs, which relate and influence the psychological adaptation to 
the illness.
AIM: The aim of this article is to examine evidence from the international 
literature regarding the possible relation of spirituality and health outcomes, 
mostly in the complex codex of a chronic and life treathing disease such as CKD.
RESULTS: Spirituality is a very debatable issue and the term has no single and 
widely agreed definition. The key components of spirituality were 'meaning', 
'hope', 'relatedness/connectedness', and 'beliefs/beliefs systems'. Spirituality 
has been characterized as the quest for meaning in life, mainly through 
experiences and expressions of mind, in a unique and dynamic process different 
for each individual. For many individuals spirituality and religion are 
important aspects of their existence, constituting a source support contribute 
to wellbeing and coping with life's daily difficulties.
CONCLUSION: Considering, assessing and addressing chronic kidney disease 
patient's spirituality and spiritual needs is necessary and it can have a 
positive outcome in health related quality of life, mental health and life 
expectancy.

Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.

The majority of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with clinically advanced 
disease. Many of these patients have a short life expectancy and are treated 
with palliative aim. Because of uncontrolled local or recurrent disease, 
patients may have significant symptoms such as: cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, 
obstructive pneumonia, or atelectasis. Brachytherapy is one of the most 
efficient methods in overcoming difficulties in breathing that is caused by 
endobronchial obstruction in palliative treatment of bronchus cancer. Efforts to 
relieve this obstructive process are worthwhile, because patients may experience 
improved quality of their life (QoL). Brachytherapy plays a limited but specific 
role in definitive treatment with curative intent in selected cases of early 
endobronchial disease as well as in the postoperative treatment of small 
residual peribronchial disease. Depending on the location of the lesion, in some 
cases brachytherapy is a treatment of choice. This option is fast, inexpensive, 
and easy to perform on an outpatient basis. Clinical indications, different 
techniques, results, and complications are presented in this work.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of heterogeneous disease derived from 
haematopoietic stem cells. Cytogenetic characterisation is essential for 
diagnosis and prognosis stratification. Here, we present the case of a 
43-year-old female diagnosed with leukaemia, who demonstrated a rare chromosomal 
change of t(11; 12) (p15; q13) along with a positive FLT3-ITD mutation. The 
patient had a white blood cell count of 76.41×109/l. Bone marrow morphology 
revealed that monoblasts accounted for 25.5% of cells, and premonocytes 
accounted for 49.0%. This patient strongly responded to idarubicin and Ara-c 
(cytarabine) chemotherapy, which rapidly eliminated the leukaemia cell clones. 
However, the proliferation rate of the leukaemia cells was high during the 
intermission of chemotherapy. Subsequently, following two courses of 
chemotherapy, full haematological remission could not be attained. AML patients 
with t(11; 12) (p15; q13) combined with FLT3-ITD mutations are expected to have 
a short life expectancy; however, early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
therapy may improve the treatment outcome for these patients.

With the increase in life expectancy, surgical intervention for colorectal 
cancer (CRC) is more frequently performed in elderly patients. This 
retrospective study was designed to compare short-term outcomes between 
laparoscopy-assisted colorectomy (LC) and open colorectomy (OC) in elderly 
patients with CRC. A total of 89 CRC patients aged ≥75 years undergoing LC were 
matched with 89 counterparts undergoing OC. The matching criteria included 
general information and preoperative status. The operative data and short-term 
postoperative outcomes were compared. Following analysis, patients in the LC and 
OC groups were comparable for the matching criteria. Compared with the OC group, 
the operative time was longer (P=0.046), but the estimated blood loss (P<0.001) 
and intraoperative transfusion (P=0.042) were less in the LC group. As regards 
short-term postoperative outcomes, the duration of postoperative hospital stay 
was shorter (P=0.001) and the incidence of wound complications was lower 
(P=0.044) with LC. The overall complication, other complications, reoperation 
and mortality rates were comparable between the two groups. In conclusion, 
considering the operative variables and short-term outcomes, LC is a safe 
procedure and appears to be superior to OC for elderly patients with CRC.

This paper presents a review of a dog, with a retrobulbar chondrosarcoma, which 
was admitted for surgery for visible changes in his eye during inspection. 
Orbital neoplasia in dogs may be primary and secondary. Sixty percent of orbital 
neoplasia in dogs are primary, ninety percent of which are malignant. 
Retrobulbar neoplasms are rare and in their early stage represent a diagnostic 
challenge. Chondrosarcoma of the skull is a slow-progressing malignant disease 
which occurs locally, aggressive with invasion into the surrounding tissues. 
Dogs with chondrosarcoma of the skull have life expectancy between 210 and 580 
days - in our case it was 180 days - after the first alterations on the eye of 
the dog occurred.

INTRODUCTION: Information regarding cost-effectiveness of community-based 
exercise programmes in COPD is scarce. Therefore, we have investigated whether a 
community-based exercise programme is a cost-effective component of 
self-management for patients with COPD after 2 years of follow-up.
METHODS: All included COPD patients participated in four self-management 
sessions. Additionally, patients in the COPE-active group participated in an 
11-month community-based exercise programme led by physiotherapists. Patients 
trained 3 times/week for 6 months and two times/week during the subsequent 5 
months. In both periods, one of these weekly training sessions was home-based 
(unsupervised). No formal physiotherapy sessions were offered to COPE-active 
patients in the second year. A decision analytical model with a 24-month 
perspective was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated and cost-effectiveness planes 
were created.
RESULTS: Data of 77 patients participating in the exercise programme and 76 
patients in the control group were analysed. The ICER for an additional patient 
prevented from deteriorating at least 47.5 meters on the ISWT was €6257. The 
ICER for an additional patient with a clinically relevant improvement (≥ 500 
steps/day) in physical activity was €1564, and the ICER for an additional 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was €10 950.
CONCLUSION: Due to a lack of maintenance of beneficial effects on our primary 
outcome exercise capacity after 2 years of follow-up and higher costs of the 
programme, the community-based exercise programme cannot be considered 
cost-effective compared to self-management programmes only. Nevertheless, the 
ICERs for the secondary outcomes physical activity and QALY are generally 
considered acceptable.

The genus Odorrana currently contains at least 56 recognized species that 
inhabits montane streams in subtropical and tropical Asia. Twenty new species 
have been described in the last decade, indicating the potential cryptic species 
diversity of this genus. We collected several specimens of Odorrana species from 
Southern China from 2007 to 2014, and on the basis of a combined morphological 
characters and phylogenetic analysis, we described the new species Odorrana 
fengkaiensis sp. nov. herein. The new species is very similar to O. hainanensis 
and O. bacboensis, but can be consistently separated by morphology, and 
allopatric distribution. It is further reciprocally monophyletic to O. 
hainanensis in a mitochondrial gene trees with an average genetic divergence of 
2.1% (1.9%-2.4%). The new species inhabits in lowland broad streams, rivers, 
pools and near the riparian areas, but its general ecology remains poorly known. 
The new species is characterized by its body length of adult females 
approximately twice as long as adult males (SVL 77.8-111.9 mm in females, 
37.4-51.8 mm in males); eye large in males, eye diameter 1.01-1.16 times as long 
as snout length; tympanum of males large and distinct, extremely close to the 
eye, 0.7-1.4 mm in tympanum-eye distance; dorsolateral folds absent; dorsal skin 
shagreened, with several large tubercles in males; flanks with tubercles and 
scattered larger pustules, 8-10 of which usually arranged in a dorsolateral row; 
ventral skin smooth, with spines in adult males during the breeding season; the 
tibio-tarsal articulation stretched forward beyond the tip of snout; relative 
finger lengths: II &lt; I &lt; IV &lt; III; dorsum brown with irregularly 
reticulated green markings in males and young females, uniformly brown in some 
old adult females; males with velvety nuptial pad on thumb, paired gular 
pouches; mature oocytes almost purely black in life, showed dark grey animal 
pole and olive vegetative pole in preservative. In addition, we found O. 
bacboensis, a new country record from China, indicating a range extension from 
north-central Vietnam to southeast Yunnan and adjacent area in Guangxi.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Understanding the factors underlying the spatio-temporal 
distribution of infectious diseases provides useful information regarding their 
prevention and control. Dengue fever spatio-temporal patterns result from 
complex interactions between the virus, the host, and the vector. These 
interactions can be influenced by environmental conditions. Our objectives were 
to analyse dengue fever spatial distribution over New Caledonia during epidemic 
years, to identify some of the main underlying factors, and to predict the 
spatial evolution of dengue fever under changing climatic conditions, at the 
2100 horizon.
METHODS: We used principal component analysis and support vector machines to 
analyse and model the influence of climate and socio-economic variables on the 
mean spatial distribution of 24,272 dengue cases reported from 1995 to 2012 in 
thirty-three communes of New Caledonia. We then modelled and estimated the 
future evolution of dengue incidence rates using a regional downscaling of 
future climate projections.
RESULTS: The spatial distribution of dengue fever cases is highly heterogeneous. 
The variables most associated with this observed heterogeneity are the mean 
temperature, the mean number of people per premise, and the mean percentage of 
unemployed people, a variable highly correlated with people's way of life. 
Rainfall does not seem to play an important role in the spatial distribution of 
dengue cases during epidemics. By the end of the 21st century, if temperature 
increases by approximately 3 °C, mean incidence rates during epidemics could 
double.
CONCLUSION: In New Caledonia, a subtropical insular environment, both 
temperature and socio-economic conditions are influencing the spatial spread of 
dengue fever. Extension of this study to other countries worldwide should 
improve the knowledge about climate influence on dengue burden and about the 
complex interplay between different factors. This study presents a methodology 
that can be used as a step by step guide to model dengue spatial heterogeneity 
in other countries.

Shaanxiana australis sp. nov. (Theclinae: Theclini) is described from southern 
China, representing a new taxon of the genus and a remarkable known geographical 
range extension of the genus. The larval host plant of S. australis is unknown, 
but the most likely candidate is Fraxinus chinensis (Oleaceae), because 
congeneric Shaanxiana takashimai use Fraxinus spp. as larval hosts, and F. 
chinensis is known to grow at the type locality of S. australis.

IMPORTANCE: Based on older analyses, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommends that cesarean delivery rates should not exceed 10 to 15 per 100 live 
births to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the contemporary relationship between national levels of 
cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional, ecological study estimating 
annual cesarean delivery rates from data collected during 2005 to 2012 for all 
194 WHO member states. The year of analysis was 2012. Cesarean delivery rates 
were available for 54 countries for 2012. For the 118 countries for which 2012 
data were not available, the 2012 cesarean delivery rate was imputed from other 
years. For the 22 countries for which no cesarean rate data were available, the 
rate was imputed from total health expenditure per capita, fertility rate, life 
expectancy, percent of urban population, and geographic region.
EXPOSURES: Cesarean delivery rate.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The relationship between population-level cesarean 
delivery rate and maternal mortality ratios (maternal death from pregnancy 
related causes during pregnancy or up to 42 days postpartum per 100,000 live 
births) or neonatal mortality rates (neonatal mortality before age 28 days per 
1000 live births).
RESULTS: The estimated number of cesarean deliveries in 2012 was 22.9 million 
(95% CI, 22.5 million to 23.2 million). At a country-level, cesarean delivery 
rate estimates up to 19.1 per 100 live births (95% CI, 16.3 to 21.9) and 19.4 
per 100 live births (95% CI, 18.6 to 20.3) were inversely correlated with 
maternal mortality ratio (adjusted slope coefficient, -10.1; 95% CI, -16.8 to 
-3.4; P = .003) and neonatal mortality rate (adjusted slope coefficient, -0.8; 
95% CI, -1.1 to -0.5; P < .001), respectively (adjusted for total health 
expenditure per capita, population, percent of urban population, fertility rate, 
and region). Higher cesarean delivery rates were not correlated with maternal or 
neonatal mortality at a country level. A sensitivity analysis including only 76 
countries with the highest-quality cesarean delivery rate information had a 
similar result: cesarean delivery rates greater than 6.9 to 20.1 per 100 live 
births were inversely correlated with the maternal mortality ratio (slope 
coefficient, -21.3; 95% CI, -32.2 to -10.5, P < .001). Cesarean delivery rates 
of 12.6 to 24.0 per 100 live births were inversely correlated with neonatal 
mortality (slope coefficient, -1.4; 95% CI, -2.3 to -0.4; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: National cesarean delivery rates of up to 
approximately 19 per 100 live births were associated with lower maternal or 
neonatal mortality among WHO member states. Previously recommended national 
target rates for cesarean deliveries may be too low.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid tumors are generally regarded as rare malignancies. 
Nowadays, however, their global incidence is growing continuously partially due 
to western life style and utilization of more sensitive methods of early 
detection. It is approximately three times more prevalent in females than in 
males. Most cases of thyroid cancer are asymptomatic nodules or just have local 
cervical symptoms or adenopathy in early stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases report 2010 study (released 
3/2013) profited from 100 collaborators worldwide and used a vast network of 
data on health outcomes, vital registries, and population surveys. It shared 
many of the Global Burden of Diseases 1990 principal databases such as all 
available data on injuries, diseases, risk factors, as well as comparable 
metrics, and used different scientific approved methods to estimate important 
health status data like: death rate, life expectancy, healthy adjusted life 
expectancy, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), years of living lost due to 
premature death and years of life with disabilities.
RESULTS: DALY as thyroid cancer burden per 100,000 Iranian populations had 
increased by about 14% during 1990 to 2010 in all ages; from 6.1 (95% UI 
4.2-9.74) years in 1990 to 6.95 (95% UI 5.06-9.18) years in 2010 in both sex. 
The 2010 peak age-group was estimated at 45-49 years in males and 40-45 years in 
females.

Informal and mostly unpaid caregivers - spouses, family, friends and neighbours 
- play a crucial role in supporting the health, well-being, functional 
independence and quality of life of growing numbers of persons of all ages who 
cannot manage on their own. Yet, informal caregiving is in decline; falling 
rates of engagement in caregiving are compounded by a shrinking caregiver pool. 
How should policymakers respond? In this paper, we draw on a growing 
international literature, along with findings from community-based studies 
conducted by our team across Ontario, to highlight six common assumptions about 
informal caregivers and what can be done to support them. These include the 
assumption that caregivers will be there to take on an increasing 
responsibility; that caregiving is only about an aging population; that money 
alone can do the job; that policymakers can simply wait and see; that front-line 
care professionals should be left to fill the policy void; and that caregivers 
should be addressed apart from cared-for persons and formal care systems. While 
each assumption has a different focus, all challenge policymakers to view 
caregivers as key players in massive social and political change, and to respond 
accordingly.

Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) represents the most severe form of inherited 
retinal dystrophies with an onset during the first year of life. Currently, 21 
genes are known to be associated with LCA and recurrent mutations have been 
observed in AIPL1, CEP290, CRB1 and GUCY2D. In addition, sequence analysis of 
LRAT and RPE65 may be important in view of treatments that are emerging for 
patients carrying variants in these genes. Screening of the aforementioned 
variants and genes was performed in 64 Danish LCA probands. Upon the 
identification of heterozygous variants, Sanger sequencing was performed of the 
relevant genes to identify the second allele. In combination with prior arrayed 
primer extension analysis, this led to the identification of two variants in 42 
of 86 cases (49%). Remarkably, biallelic RPE65 variants were identified in 16% 
of the cases, and one novel variant, p.(D110G), was found in seven RPE65 
alleles. We also collected all previously published RPE65 variants, identified 
in 914 alleles of 539 patients with LCA or early-onset retinitis pigmentosa, and 
deposited them in the RPE65 Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). The in silico 
pathogenicity assessment of the missense and noncanonical splice site variants, 
as well as an analysis of their frequency in ~60 000 control individuals, 
rendered 864 of the alleles to affect function or probably affect function. This 
comprehensive database can now be used to select patients eligible for gene 
augmentation or retinoid supplementation therapies.

BACKGROUND: Chikungunya (CHIK) virus disease is expected to be a considerable 
cause of disability and economic burden in Latin America given its chronic 
sequelae, particularly its chronic inflammatory rheumatism. There have been no 
previous studies assessing CHIK costs and disability in Latin America.
METHODS: We calculated incidence rates for CHIK during the 2014 outbreak in 
Colombia using epidemiological data provided by the Colombian National Institute 
of Health, using demographic data from the National Administrative Department of 
Statistics. The burden of disease was estimated through disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) lost and the costs were estimated based on the national 
recommendations for CHIK acute and chronic phase attention.
RESULTS: There were a total of 106 592 cases, with incidence rates ranging from 
0 to 1837.3 cases/100 000 population in different departments. An estimate was 
made of total DALYs lost of 40.44 to 45.14 lost/100 000 population. The 2014 
outbreak estimated costs were at least US$73.6 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates raise concerns about the effects of continued CHIK 
spread in Colombia and other Latin-American countries. The lack of transmission 
control for this disease and potential for spread means that there will be 
significant acute and chronic disability and related costs in the short and long 
term for Latin American health care systems.

Ageing of people with Down's syndrome: a systematic literature review from 2000 
to 2014.

Life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome (DS) has increased considerably, 
now exceeding 60 years. People with DS start to get old around the age of 45. By 
referring to the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability 
and Health (ICF) biopsychosocial perspective, this study aimed to present an 
up-to-date review of the past 14 years of literature concerning the ageing of 
people with DS. PUBMED, PsycInfo and the Social Sciences Citation Index were 
searched for studies published between 2000 and 2014. Studies were selected if 
they were written in English, focused on people more than 45 years of age with 
DS, and if terms related to DS and ageing appeared in either the title or the 
abstract. A total of 30 studies were retrieved and their meaningful concepts 
were linked to the ICF. In total, 38 ICF categories were identified that were 
mainly related to intellectual functions (b117) (19%), general metabolic 
functions (b540) (7.4%), mobility of joint functions (b710), muscle power 
functions (b730) (4.2%), gait pattern functions (b770) (4.2%) and structure of 
the brain (s110) (4.3%). Only two studies considered environmental factors, and 
only one considered the joint analysis of health condition and environmental 
factors. Data about the ageing of people with DS are predominantly based on 
medical evaluations and descriptions of their physical impairments. Few attempts 
have been made towards a comprehensive assessment of elderly people with DS with 
a joint analysis of their health condition and its interaction with 
environmental factors.

Has the Rate of Human Aging Already Been Modified?

Olshansky SJ(1).

In recent years, three hypotheses have been set forth positing variations on a 
common question-Has the rate of human aging already been modified? There is no 
disputing that people now live longer than ever before in history, and 
considerable variation in duration of life persists as a fundamental attribute 
of human longevity, but are these events caused by a measurable and verifiable 
difference in the rate at which people age, or are there other reasons why they 
occur? In this article, I explore the historical record involving changes in 
survival and life expectancy at older ages dating back to 1900, and examine what 
factors will likely contribute to changes in longevity in the United States 
through 2040. Evidence suggests that despite the absence of verifiable metrics 
of biological age, delayed aging is unlikely to be a cause of secular increases 
in life expectancy, but it could explain variation in survival among population 
subgroups, and it is the most likely explanation for why exceptionally 
long-lived people experience less disease and live longer than the rest of the 
population. If genetic heterogeneity explains any significant part of current 
variation in longevity, this opens the door to the development of therapeutic 
interventions that confer these advantages to the rest of the population.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening infection mainly 
affecting immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis is critical, but the 
diagnostic gold standard (histopathology and culture) is time consuming and 
cannot offer early confirmation of IPA. Fungal biomarkers like galactomannan 
(GM) are a promising extension to the diagnostic repertoire. However, it still 
remains under discussion if biomarker analysis from the site of the infection is 
superior to testing blood samples. We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic 
performance of concurrent serum GM and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GM (obtained 
within 24 h) of immunocompromised patients at high risk of IPA. Twenty-six 
proven/probable patients and eight patients with no IPA according to the 
EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria were included in this study. Sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic odds ratio 
were for BAL GM: 85%, 88%, 96%, 64% and 38.5, and for serum GM: 23%, 88%, 88%, 
26% and 2.1 respectively. BAL GM proved to be significantly more sensitive for 
the detection of IPA compared to same-day serum GM in patients at high risk of 
IPA (P < 0.0001). Our data show that BAL GM testing is significantly superior to 
serum GM implying that diagnostic efforts should focus on specimens from the 
site of infection.

A growing body of evidence has found that mortality rates are positively 
correlated with social inequalities, air pollution, elevated ambient 
temperature, availability of medical care and other factors. This study develops 
a model to predict the mortality rates for different diseases by county across 
the US. The model is applied to predict changes in mortality caused by changing 
environmental factors. A total of 3,110 counties in the US, excluding Alaska and 
Hawaii, were studied. A subset of 519 counties from the 3,110 counties was 
chosen by using systematic random sampling and these samples were used to 
validate the model. Step-wise and linear regression analyses were used to 
estimate the ability of environmental pollutants, socio-economic factors and 
other factors to explain variations in county-specific mortality rates for 
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
all causes combined and lifespan across five population density groups. The 
estimated models fit adequately for all mortality outcomes for all population 
density groups and, adequately predicted risks for the 519 validation counties. 
This study suggests that, at local county levels, average ozone (0.07 ppm) is 
the most important environmental predictor of mortality. The analysis also 
illustrates the complex inter-relationships of multiple factors that influence 
mortality and lifespan, and suggests the need for a better understanding of the 
pathways through which these factors, mortality, and lifespan are related at the 
community level.

Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD‖Institute for 
Work & Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for nonspecific 
low back pain (LBP).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many people with chronic LBP use complementary and 
alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal 
medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an 
update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.
METHODS: We searched numerous electronic databases up to September 2014; checked 
reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and 
personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. We included RCTs 
examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub-acute, or 
chronic nonspecific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines that we defined 
as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were 
pain and function. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria 
(GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared with 
assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical 
relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus.
RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs (2050 participants) were included. Capsicum frutescens 
(cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although Harpagophytum procumbens 
(devil's claw), Salix alba (white willow bark), Symphytum officinale L. 
(comfrey), Solidago chilensis (Brazilian arnica), and lavender essential oil 
also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of 
moderate quality at best. No significant adverse events were noted within the 
included trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed large trials are needed to test these 
herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of 
reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT 
statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.

BACKGROUND: Etrolizumab (rhuMAb beta7) is an anti-integrin that selectively 
targets the β7 subunits of the α4β7 and αEβ7 integrins, which are involved in 
the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety 
of etrolizumab for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library 
(CENTRAL) from inception to 12 March 2015. References and conference abstracts 
were searched to identify additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) trials in which 
etrolizumab was compared to placebo or another active comparator in patients 
with active ulcerative colitis were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened studies for 
inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We assessed 
methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome 
was failure to induce clinical remission (as defined by the primary studies). 
Secondary outcomes included failure to induce clinical improvement (as defined 
by the primary studies), failure to induce endoscopic remission (as defined by 
the primary studies), adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to 
adverse events, and health-related quality of life (as defined by the primary 
studies). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE 
criteria. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs including 172 patients with moderate to severe UC who 
failed conventional therapy met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were rated 
as low risk of bias. We did not pool efficacy data from the two included studies 
due to differences in dose and route of administration. The small phase I study 
found no statistically significant differences between etrolizumab and placebo 
in the proportion of patients who failed to enter remission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 
1.04 to 1.69; participants = 23) or respond at week 10 (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.26 to 
10.82; participants = 23). The phase II study reported on failure to enter 
clinical remission at weeks 6 and 10. In the etrolizumab group 91% (71/78) of 
patients failed to enter remission at week 6 compared to 95% (39/41) of placebo 
patients (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06). Subgroup analysis revealed no 
statistically significant differences by dose. At week 10, there was a 
statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates favouring 
etrolizumab over placebo. Of the patients who received etrolizumab, 85% (66/78) 
failed to enter remission at week 10 compared to 100% (41/41) patients in the 
placebo group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95). A subgroup analysis by dose found 
a statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates favoring 100 
mg etrolizumab over placebo (RR 0.81 CI 95% 0.68 to 0.96), but not 300 mg 
etrolizumab over placebo (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03). No significant 
heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (P = 0.28, I(2) = 13.5%). GRADE 
analyses indicated that the overall quality of evidence for the clinical 
remission outcomes was moderate due to sparse data. Both of the included studies 
reported on safety. The outcome adverse events was initially pooled, however 
this analysis was removed due to high heterogeneity (I(2) = 88%). The phase I 
study found no statistically significant difference between etrolizumab and 
placebo in the proportion of patients who had at least one adverse event. 
Ninety-five per cent (36/38) of etrolizumab patients had at least one adverse 
event compared to 100% (10/10) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 
1.14). Common adverse events reported in the phase I study included exacerbation 
of UC, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, nausea, 
arthralgia and urinary tract infection. There was a statistically significant 
difference between etrolizumab and placebo in the proportion of patients who had
