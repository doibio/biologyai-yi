PURPOSE: The study objective was to develop an economic model to assess 
projected costs of lost productivity associated with premature deaths due to 
veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/ sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) with 
multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) among patients in the US who underwent 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) in 2013.
METHODS: Data sources included the US Census Bureau and Department of Health, 
epidemiologic research organizations, and medical research literature. The model 
considered only lost productivity associated with premature death, with lifetime 
salary assumed to reflect productivity. Average annual salary was assumed to be 
the same for HSCT survivors and the general population, with a working age range 
between 18 and 65 years. Key data inputs included number of HSCTs by graft type 
(allogeneic and autologous) performed in the US in 2013, HSCT-related mortality, 
mortality associated with VOD/SOS with MOD, and life-expectancy reduction for 
HSCT survivors vs the general population. Excess mortality equaled total deaths 
among patients with VOD/SOS and MOD minus deaths in these patients due to causes 
other than VOD/SOS with MOD.
RESULTS: Among 18,284 patients who underwent HSCT in the US in 2013, the model 
estimated that 361 excess deaths due to VOD/SOS with MOD occurred (158 following 
allogeneic and 203 after autologous transplants). These deaths accounted for 
total lost work productivity of 5,990 years and $124,212,173 in lost wages, 
averaging 17 years and $343,791 per patient. A sensitivity analysis 
incorporating adjustment factors for epidemiologic and economic inputs 
calculated total financial loss of $84 million to $194 million.
LIMITATION: Estimates of post-HSCT VOD/SOS with MOD incidence and mortality were 
approximated, due to changing HSCT practices.
CONCLUSION: Premature death due to VOD/SOS with MOD imposes a substantial 
economic burden in this population in terms of lost productivity. Additional 
studies of this economic burden are warranted.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term oncological outcome of organ-confined 
(<pT3) renal cell carcinoma.
METHODS: We identified 889 patients with complete long-term follow-up data, who 
had been surgically treated for renal cell carcinoma (<T3) at our institution 
between 1976 and 2009. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the incidence 
and time interval of recurrence defined as local recurrences or metastases. We 
further compared patients who had tumor progression before or after 60 months.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 74.33 months (range 3-329 months), 
44 patients (4.9%) had disease recurrence. A total of 38.6% of the recurrences 
occurred after 60 months; 76.2% of patients had distant metastases and 23.8% of 
patients had local recurrences. In patients with low-grade (G1) and low-stage 
(pT1a) tumors, there was a trend to develop recurrence or metastases after 
longer intervals. Patients with lung metastasis and patients with multiple 
metastatic locations developed these metastases earlier than patients with bone 
metastasis. The risk of dying of other causes correlated with age, but the time 
interval to metastases did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines recommend a follow-up period of 60 months after 
surgical treatment of organ-confined renal cell carcinoma. Our data shows that 
one-third of recurrences of <pT3 renal cell carcinoma occur after 60 months. 
According to our oncological analysis, we suggest an age-adjusted strategy of 
follow-up balancing the risk of tumor recurrence and the life expectancy of the 
patient.

Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. kkorzeniewski@wim.mil.pl.

All over the world there has been a sudden increase in the number of 
international travels, mostly for touristic purposes. According to the World 
Tourism Organisation, the number of international journeys exceeded 1.323 
billion in 2017 and it continues to grow. Of the growing number of travellers 
more and more are the elderly (> 65 years), this fact can be attributed to 
longer life expectancy and a better quality of life, especially in the developed 
countries. The article lists the main destinations chosen by senior tourists and 
their reasons for travel, it also discusses physiological changes in organs and 
systems affecting the elderly, which are the result of travelling across time 
zones and to areas with different environment. The article looks at various 
groups of patients affected by chronic diseases and examines health-related 
consequences of travel, including the most common complications. The general 
health prevention measures, with emphasis on vaccinations and antimalarial 
chemoprophylaxis, have also been discussed.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are coinfected with hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have access to effective 
treatment options for HCV infection. However, they also have access to 
HCV-infected kidneys, which historically afford shorter times to 
transplantation. Given the high waitlist mortality and rapid progression of 
liver fibrosis among coinfected kidney-only transplant candidates, 
identification of the optimal treatment strategy is paramount. Two strategies, 
treatment pre- and posttransplant, were compared using Monte Carlo 
microsimulation of 1 000 000 candidates. The microsimulation was stratified by 
liver fibrosis stage at waitlist addition and wait-time over a lifetime time 
horizon. Treatment posttransplant was consistently cost-saving as compared to 
treatment pretransplant due to the high cost of dialysis. Among patients with 
low fibrosis disease (F0-F1), treatment posttransplant also yielded higher life 
months (LM) and quality-adjusted life months (QALM), except among F1 candidates 
with wait times ≥ 18 months. For candidates with advanced liver disease (F2-F4), 
treatment pretransplant afforded more LM and QALM unless wait time was 
<18 months. Moreover, treatment pretransplant was cost-effective for F2 
candidates with wait times >71 months and F3 candidates with wait times 
>18 months. Thus, optimal timing of HCV treatment differs based on liver disease 
severity and wait time, favoring pretransplant treatment when cirrhosis 
development prior to transplant seems likely.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a societal burden greater 
than $39 billion annually. Novel treatments, known as targeted immune modulators 
(TIMs), are expensive but effective, producing improvements in response rates 
compared with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). 
Sarilumab, a TIM approved in 2017, shows superior improvements compared with 
cDMARDs and produced significantly greater likelihood of achieving response and 
improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index than 
adalimumab monotherapy. Although sarilumab monotherapy has shown improvements 
over cDMARDs and the TIM market leader adalimumab, treatment with sarilumab is 
costly, with an annual wholesale acquisition cost of $39,000.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of starting treatment 
with sarilumab monotherapy for adult patients with moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs.
METHODS: A sequential treatment cohort model followed a hypothetical cohort from 
initiation of sarilumab monotherapy until death. The model allowed patients to 
switch therapies up to 3 times due to effectiveness or adverse events. The first 
switch was to a TIM within the same treatment category; the second switch was to 
a TIM within a different treatment category; and the third switch was to a 
cDMARD. Sarilumab monotherapy was compared with a cDMARD (methotrexate) and the 
TIM market leader (adalimumab monotherapy). Key risk and benefit evidence came 
from clinical studies and network meta-analyses of data on radiographic 
progression and response. We used a lifetime time horizon and the U.S. health 
sector payer perspective assuming therapy net pricing. We also incorporated loss 
of productivity to reflect a restricted societal perspective.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, a treatment pathway starting with 
sarilumab resulted in 17.16 life-years and 13.66 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Treatment pathways starting with the cDMARD resulted in 16.54 
life-years and 11.77 QALYs; treatment pathways starting with adalimumab resulted 
in 17.05 life-years and 13.35 QALYs. Total costs for sarilumab ($492,000 for 
payer perspective, $634,000 for societal perspective) were less than total costs 
for adalimumab ($536,000 for payer perspective, $689,000 for societal 
perspective) but higher than total costs for the cDMARD ($63,000 for payer 
perspective, $272,000 for societal perspective). When compared with cDMARD 
therapy, sarilumab resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of $227,000 per 
QALY gained from the payer perspective and $191,000 per QALYs gained from the 
societal perspective. When compared with adalimumab, sarilumab was dominant from 
both perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarilumab resulted in better health outcomes than conventional 
therapy alone. However, its additional cost with assumed class-level net prices 
led to cost-effectiveness estimates above commonly cited thresholds. When 
compared with the market leader, sarilumab achieved favorable value. This 
evaluation informs stakeholders of the value of sarilumab and its alternatives 
to promote high value practices in health care.

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation are current 
treatments for moderate to severe medication-refractory essential tremor. 
However, they are invasive and thus carry risks. Magnetic resonance-guided 
focused ultrasound is a new, less invasive surgical option. The objective of the 
present study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of magnetic 
resonance-guided focused ultrasound compared with standard treatments in Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov cohort model. We 
compared magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound with no surgery in people 
ineligible for invasive neurosurgery and with radiofrequency thalamotomy and 
deep brain stimulation in people eligible for invasive neurosurgery. In the 
reference case analysis, we used a 5-year time horizon and a public payer 
perspective and discounted costs and benefits at 1.5% per year.
RESULTS: Compared with no surgery in people ineligible for invasive 
neurosurgery, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound cost $21,438 more but 
yielded 0.47 additional quality-adjusted life years, producing an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,817 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In 
people eligible for invasive neurosurgery, magnetic resonance-guided focused 
ultrasound was slightly less effective but much less expensive compared with the 
current standard of care, deep brain stimulation. The results were sensitive to 
assumptions regarding the time horizon, cost of magnetic resonance-guided 
focused ultrasound, and probability of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: In people ineligible for invasive neurosurgery, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound versus 
no surgery is comparable to many other tests and treatments that are widely 
adopted in high-income countries. In people eligible for invasive neurosurgery, 
magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is also a reasonable option. © 2018

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in 
the world. With the advent of an aging population and improving life expectancy 
worldwide, the number of PD patients is expected to increase, which may lead to 
an urgent need for effective preventive and diagnostic strategies for PD. 
Although there is increasing research regarding the pathogenesis of PD, there is 
limited knowledge regarding the prevention of PD. Moreover, the diagnosis of PD 
depends on clinical criteria, which require the occurrence of bradykinesia and 
at least one symptom of rest tremor or rigidity. However, converging evidence 
from clinical, genetic, neuropathological, and imaging studies suggests the 
initiation of PD-specific pathology prior to the initial presentation of these 
classical motor clinical features by years or decades. This latent stage of 
neurodegeneration in PD is a particularly important stage for effective 
neuroprotective therapies, which might retard the progression or prevent the 
onset of PD. Therefore, the exploration of risk factors and premotor biomarkers 
is not only crucial to the early diagnosis of PD but is also helpful in the 
development of effective neuroprotection and health care strategies for 
appropriate populations at risk for PD. In this review, we searched and 
summarized ∼249 researches and 31 reviews focusing on the risk factors and 
prodromal biomarkers of PD and published in MEDLINE.

OBJECTIVES: Little is known about sex differences in healthy life expectancy 
among the oldest old, the fastest growing segment of the older population. This 
study examines sex differences in total, healthy and unhealthy life expectancy 
among nonagenarians.
METHODS: Longitudinal data of 884 older adults aged 90 and over participating in 
the Vitality 90+ study (Tampere, Finland) were used, including 2501 observations 
(health or death states) from 5 measurement waves between 2001 and 2014. Using 
the MSM and ELECT packages in R, multistate survival models were performed to 
estimate the transition probabilities of older adults through the different 
health states and to calculate life expectancies. The analyses were done 
separately for two health indicators (disability and multimorbidity) to see 
whether patterns were consistent.
RESULTS: Women had higher total life expectancies than men (about 8 months), but 
also higher unhealthy life expectancies. Men had a higher disability-free life 
expectancy between the age of 90 and 95 compared to women. For multimorbidity, 
no sex differences in healthy life expectancy were found.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the male-female health-survival paradox 
remains at very old age. Women aged 90+ live longer than men, and spend more 
time in poor health.

of Fallot†.

Milanese, Italy.

OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot is 
normal until adulthood, when it becomes burdened by major complications such as 
cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. Ventricular tachycardia (VT), associated 
with electrical conduction abnormalities in anatomical isthmuses, is the most 
common complication and is refractory to medical therapy. The arrhythmogenic 
sources can be surgically ablated during reoperations for pulmonary valve 
incompetence. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of surgical radiofrequency ablation during PVR and its long-term 
impact on the occurrence of cardiac events.
METHODS: A total of 118 patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot underwent 
reoperation for pulmonary valve regurgitation in IRCCS-Policlinico San Donato 
between January 2002 and February 2016. Twenty patients with risk factors for 
ventricular arrhythmia underwent EP testing and were found positive. The mean 
QRS duration was 178 ms. Right ventricular dysfunction was present in all the 
patients, and 20% had associated tricuspid regurgitation. The cohort (N = 20), 
with positive EP study, underwent pulmonary valve replacement and concomitant 
intraoperative ventricular surgical radiofrequency ablation, targeting the slow 
conducting isthmuses identified during preoperative electroanatomical mapping. 
All patients were reviewed at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months with clinical 
evaluation, echocardiography, ECG and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
interrogation. At 6 months, a postoperative electrophysiological study was 
performed in all patients, and a cardioverter defibrillator was implanted as 
primary preventive measure in patients with residual inducible VT.
RESULTS: Pulmonary valve replacement and surgical ventricular radiofrequency 
ablation were performed in all cases. One patient died while on V-V 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to respiratory failure. There was 
no late mortality. Follow-up was complete with a median of 6.5 years. During the 
postoperative EPS study, inducible VT was found in 15.7% of patients who 
received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, whereas VT could no longer 
be induced in the remaining patients. No procedure-related complication was 
observed, and freedom from ventricular arrhythmia was 94% and 89.5% at 1 year 
and 5 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction correlate 
with VT and SCD, but valve replacement alone does not reduce the risk of 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Intraoperative ventricular ablation during 
reoperation for pulmonary regurgitation prevents the occurrence of ventricular 
arrhythmias in the early and medium term. Accordingly, this technique may be 
proposed as a safe associated procedure in selected patients.

Overhead sprinkler compared to drip irrigation in cropping systems can result in 
increased relative humidity (RH) and decreased temperature within the plant 
canopy. Such conditions may also result in a more favorable microclimate for 
pests. Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is an invasive agricultural pest of berries 
in America and Europe. Drosophila suzukii is susceptible to high temperatures 
and low RH, thus its survival may be affected by different irrigation methods. 
We tested how drip and overhead sprinkler irrigation in blueberries influenced 
temperature and RH. Furthermore, we determined how these environmental factors 
affected adult emergence rates from larvae within fruit or pupae outside of 
fruit. RH was higher in overhead sprinkler compared to drip irrigation 
treatments, but there was no difference in temperatures. Although there were no 
differences in fly emergence from larvae between irrigation treatments, more 
flies emerged from pupae in overhead sprinkler compared to drip irrigation 
treatments. This is likely because larvae developing inside fruit are protected 
from desiccation, while pupae were exposed to lower RH. Regardless of irrigation 
method, temperatures remained above 30°C for longer periods and RH was lower 
above as opposed to below the mulch. Fewer D. suzukii larvae and pupae 
consequently survived above the mulch than below the mulch. When assessing 
natural infestation, we found similar numbers of D. suzukii flies emerging from 
blueberries collected on drip and sprinkler rows. Irrigation management can be 
coupled with other cultural control methods that ensure that pupae remain 
exposed on low RH surfaces, where they are more likely to succumb to 
desiccation.

BACKGROUND: Cross-national comparison studies on gender differences have mainly 
focussed on life expectancy, while less research has examined differences in 
health across countries. We aimed to investigate gender differences in cognitive 
function and grip strength over age and time across European regions.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 51 292 men and 62 007 
women aged 50 + participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in 
Europe between 2004-05 and 2015. Linear regression models were used to examine 
associations.
RESULTS: In general, women had better cognitive function than men, whereas men 
had higher grip strength measures. Sex differences were consistent over time, 
but decreased with age. Compared with men, women had higher cognitive scores at 
ages 50-59, corresponding to 0.17 SD (95% CI 0.14, 0.20) but slightly lower 
scores at ages 80-89 (0.08 SD, 95% CI 0.14, 0.00). For grip strength, the sex 
difference decreased from 18.8 kg (95% CI 18.5, 19.1) at ages 50-59 to 8.5 kg 
(95% CI 7.1, 9.9) at age 90 + . Northern Europeans had higher cognitive scores 
(19.6%) and grip strength measures (13.8%) than Southern Europeans. Gender 
differences in grip strength were similar across regions, whereas for cognitive 
function they varied considerably, with Southern Europe having a male advantage 
from ages 60-89.
CONCLUSION: Our results illustrate that gender differences in health depend on 
the selected health dimension and the age group studied, and emphasize the 
importance of considering regional differences in research on cognitive gender 
differences.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate temporal trends in the incidence and prevalence of 
gout in the adult Danish population.
METHODS: Using the nationwide Danish National Patient Registry, we calculated 
the number of incident gout patients (per 100 000 person-years) within each 1 
year period from 1995 to 2015 and the prevalence of gout in 2000 and 2015. 
Further, we calculated age- and gender-specific incidence rates of gout from 
1995 to 2015.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 45 685 incident gout patients (72.9% males) 
with a mean age of 65 years (s.d. 16) at diagnosis. In both genders, an increase 
in age-standardized incidence rates was observed from 32.3/100 000 (95% CI 30.7, 
33.9) in 1995 to 57.5/100 000 (95% CI 55.6, 59.5) in 2015 (P < 0.001). Similar 
trends were observed for 8950 cases diagnosed in rheumatology departments. We 
likewise observed an increase in the prevalence of gout from 0.29% (95% CI 0.29, 
0.30) in 2000 to 0.68% (95% CI 0.68, 0.69) in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: The annual incidence rate of gout increased by almost 80% in 
Denmark between 1995 and 2015. The prevalence increased by nearly 130% between 
2000 and 2015. Reasons for this are unknown but may include an increase in risk 
factors (e.g. obesity, diabetes mellitus), longer life expectancy and increased 
awareness of the disease among patients and/or health professionals.

BACKGROUND: The slump test is a type of neurodynamic test that is believed to 
evaluate the mechanosensitivity of the neuromeningeal structures within the 
vertebral canal. The objective of this review was to investigate the 
effectiveness of slump stretching on back pain and disability in patients with 
low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: We searched eight electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Ovid, 
CINAHL, Embase, PEDro, Google Scholar, CENTRAL). The publication language was 
restricted to English, and we searched the full time period available for each 
database, up to October 2017. Our primary outcomes were pain and disability, and 
the secondary outcome was range of motion (ROM).
RESULTS: We identified 12 eligible studies with 515 LBP patients. All included 
studies reported short-term follow-up. A large effect size (standardized mean 
difference [SMD] = -2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -3.35 to -0.95) and 
significant effect were determined, favoring the use of slump stretching to 
decrease pain in patients with LBP. In addition, large effect sizes and 
significant results were also found for the effect of slump stretching on 
disability improvement (SMD = -8.03, 95% CI = -11.59 to -4.47) in the LBP 
population. A qualitative synthesis of results showed that slump stretching can 
significantly increase straight leg raise and active knee extension ROM.
CONCLUSIONS: There is very low to moderate quality of evidence that slump 
stretching may have positive effects on pain in people with LBP. However, the 
quality of evidence for the benefits of slump stretching on disability was very 
low. Finally, it appears that patients with nonradicular LBP may benefit most 
from slump stretching compared with other types of LBP.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Compared to intravenous taxane chemotherapy, newer 
orally-available and/or less toxic agents for metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (MCRPC) may be associated with higher likelihood of starting 
treatment in patients with adverse prognostic features and limited life 
expectancy. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the rates of treatment 
initiation during the last 30 days of life in a real-world cohort of men with 
MCRPC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 146 patients.
RESULTS: Seven patients (5%) who started any systemic treatment during the last 
30 days of life were identified. The likelihood of treatment initiation in the 
last 30 days of life correlated significantly with the number of lines of 
systemic treatment (higher risk for previously treated patients) and non-use of 
bone-targeted agents.
CONCLUSION: Initiation of systemic therapy in the last 30 days of life was 
uncommon. This endpoint might complement other quality-of-care indicators.

The effects of pecan nut (Carya illinoinensis) and roselle flower (Hibiscus 
sabdariffa) as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents on shelf life extension of 
sardines (Sardina pilchardus) were evaluated over a period of 5 days at 7 ± 1 
°C. Treatments consisted of the addition of 5% and 10% w/w pecan nut, 5% w/w 
roselle flower and a combination of 5% of each. Physicochemical (lipid 
oxidation, fatty acids, hexanal and biogenic amines), sensory and 
microbiological characteristics of fish samples were periodically analyzed. All 
treatments effectively improved physicochemical quality parameters, with 10% w/w 
pecan nut having the highest effectiveness. The presence of roselle flower 
reduced microbial growth. Our findings suggest that addition of a natural 
preservative combining pecan nut and roselle flower may extend the shelf life of 
fresh sardines during chilled storage while maintaining quality indexes.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate survival of metastatic bone 
disease of an upper extremity, and to identify the prognostic factors that 
influence survival.
METHODS: Patients with metastatic bone disease of an upper extremity between 
2008 and 2015 were reviewed from the database of a tertiary university hospital.
RESULTS: Of 102 patients, 48 males and 54 females with a median age of 61 
(range, 28-82 years), the humerus (64.7%), clavicle (13.7%), and scapula (12.7%) 
were the common sites for bone metastasis of an upper extremity. Fifty-nine 
(57.8%) presented with pathologic fracture. No history of cancer was found in 
76.5% of patients. The mean onset of metastatic bone disease after the first 
diagnosis of primary cancer was 4.74 ± 14.07 months (range, 0-84 months). Lung 
(31.4%) was the most common primary cancer followed by liver (14.7%), breast 
(12.7%), thyroid (7.8%), and renal (3.9%). Eighty-two cases (80.39%) died from 
the disease such that the median survival was 4.08 months (95% CI 2.57-6.17). 
The significant risk factors were the type of primary tumor (P < 0.001, 
HR = 4.44; 95% CI, 1.99-9.90) and ECOG performance status (P = 0.021, HR = 2.11, 
95% CI 1.12-3.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with metastatic bone disease of an upper extremity have a 
limited life expectancy. The type of primary tumor and ECOG performance status 
were the important prognostic factors that influenced overall survival. Our data 
help in the management of patients, families, and doctors, so as to avoid over- 
or under-treatment.

Advances in the development of effective and safe treatments for haemophilia 
over the last 50 years have resulted in a significant increase in the life 
expectancy of persons with haemophilia (PWH). The management of this new cohort 
of middle-aged and elderly PWH is challenging because of the opposing risks of 
haemophilia and age-related cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Furthermore, 
this cohort of ageing PWH has the additional comorbidities of human 
immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C and chronic haemophilic arthropathy. This 
article reviews the prevalence, underlying mechanisms and treatment strategies 
for managing these comorbidities. International collaboration is essential for 
registry data and further prospective trials to inform optimal evidence-based 
management for this rare disorder in the future.

Background "Financial toxicity" is a concern for patients, but little is known 
about how patients consider out-of-pocket cost in decisions. 
Sacubitril-valsartan provides a contemporary scenario to understand financial 
toxicity. It is guideline recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction, yet out-of-pocket costs can be considerable. Methods and Results 
Structured interviews were conducted with 49 patients with heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction at heart failure clinics and inpatient services. 
Patient opinions of the drug and its value were solicited after description of 
benefits using graphical displays. Descriptive quantitative analysis of 
closed-ended responses was conducted, and qualitative descriptive analysis of 
text data was performed. Of participants, 92% (45/49) said that they would 
definitely or probably switch to sacubitril-valsartan if their physician 
recommended it and out-of-pocket cost was $5 more per month than their current 
medication. Only 43% (21/49) would do so if out-of-pocket cost was $100 more per 
month ( P<0.001). At least 40% across all income categories would be unlikely to 
take sacubitril-valsartan at $100 more per month. Participants exhibited 
heterogeneous approaches to cost in decision making and varied on their use and 
interpretation of probabilistic information. Few (20%) participants stated 
physicians had initiated a conversation about cost in the past year. Conclusions 
Out-of-pocket cost variation reflective of contemporary cost sharing 
substantially influenced stated willingness to take sacubitril-valsartan, a 
guideline-recommended therapy with mortality benefit. These findings suggest a 
need for cost transparency to promote shared decision making. They also 
demonstrate the complexity of cost discussion and need to study how to 
incorporate out-of-pocket cost into clinical decisions.

Aging is an inevitable and ubiquitous progress that affects all living 
organisms. A total of 18 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were evaluated on 
the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an 
intracellular energy sensor mediating lifespan extension. The cell-free 
supernatant (CFS) of Lactobacillus fermentum DR9 (LF-DR9), Lactobacillus 
paracasei OFS 0291 (LP-0291), and Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 (LH-1515) 
showed the highest activation of AMPK and was further evaluated. The 
phosphorylation of AMPK by these three LAB strains was more evident in U2OS and 
C2C12 cells, compared to the other cell lines and control (P < .05). Using 
premature senescent Sprague-Dawley rats induced by D-galactose (D-gal), the 
administration of LAB (10 log CFU/rat/day) for 12 weeks prevented the shortening 
of telomere length in D-gal-treated rats compared to the untreated control 
(P < .05). LF-DR9 lowered gene expression of p53, a known senescent biomarker, 
in gastrocnemius muscle and tibia compared to the control. The selected LAB 
strains also enhanced lipid, renal, and liver profile of rats, suggesting added 
potential of the strains in preventing aging-induced metabolic diseases. Strain 
LP-0291 and LH-1515 showed ability to adhere to mucin, no antibiotic resistance, 
tolerated and proliferated under gastric and intestinal simulated conditions, 
and inhibited the growth of pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, 
and Staphylococcus epidermidis, comparable to commercial probiotic LF-DR9 and 
Lactobacillus sakei Probio 65. This study provided an insight into the potential 
of LAB for exhibiting antisenescence effects, with potentials as new medicinal 
foods for targeted antiaging therapies.
