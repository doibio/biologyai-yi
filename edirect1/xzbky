REVIEW METHODS: Types of studies: direct/indirect studies reporting diagnostic 
outcomes.
INDEX TEST: time domain optical coherence tomography (TD-OCT) or spectral domain 
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
COMPARATORS: clinical evaluation, visual acuity, Amsler grid, colour fundus 
photographs, infrared reflectance, red-free images/blue reflectance, fundus 
autofluorescence imaging, indocyanine green angiography, preferential 
hyperacuity perimetry, microperimetry. Reference standard: fundus fluorescein 
angiography (FFA). Risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment of 
diagnostic accuracy studies, version 2. Meta-analysis models were fitted using 
hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves. A Markov model 
was developed (65-year-old cohort, nAMD prevalence 70%), with nine strategies 
for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and cost-utility analysis conducted. NHS and 
Personal Social Services perspective was adopted. Costs (2011/12 prices) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted (3.5%). Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In pooled estimates of diagnostic studies (all TD-OCT), sensitivity and 
specificity [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 88% (46% to 98%) and 78% (64% to 
88%) respectively. For monitoring, the pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% 
CI) was 85% (72% to 93%) and 48% (30% to 67%) respectively. The FFA for 
diagnosis and nurse-technician-led monitoring strategy had the lowest cost (£ 
39,769; QALYs 10.473) and dominated all others except FFA for diagnosis and 
ophthalmologist-led monitoring (£ 44,649; QALYs 10.575; incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio £ 47,768). The least costly strategy had a 46.4% 
probability of being cost-effective at £ 30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.
LIMITATIONS: Very few studies provided sufficient information for inclusion in 
meta-analyses. Only a few studies reported other tests; for some tests no 
studies were identified. The modelling was hampered by a lack of data on the 
diagnostic accuracy of strategies involving several tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a small body of evidence of variable quality, OCT had high 
sensitivity and moderate specificity for diagnosis, and relatively high 
sensitivity but low specificity for monitoring. Strategies involving OCT alone 
for diagnosis and/or monitoring were unlikely to be cost-effective. Further 
research is required on (i) the performance of SD-OCT compared with FFA, 
especially for monitoring but also for diagnosis; (ii) the performance of 
strategies involving combinations/sequences of tests, for diagnosis and 
monitoring; (iii) the likelihood of active and inactive nAMD becoming inactive 
or active respectively; and (iv) assessment of treatment-associated utility 
weights (e.g. decrements), through a preference-based study.

Despite treatment advances, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still associated with 
significant disability, decreased work capacity, and reduced life expectancy. 
Effective immunotherapies to restore immune tolerance promise greater 
specificity, lower toxicity, and a longer-term solution to controlling and 
preventing RA. Design of effective therapies requires a fundamental 
understanding of the critical immunopathogenetic pathways in RA. This article 
reviews advances in the understanding of self-antigen-specific T cells in 
autoimmune diseases including RA and type 1 diabetes, which bring exciting 
insights to the mechanisms underpinning loss of tolerance and how tolerance 
could be restored for disease prevention in the preclinical or recent-onset 
period.

OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of reduced doses 
or discontinuation of etanercept biosimilar (Yisaipu) in patients with 
moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to project lifetime 
medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in moderately active RA. 
Strategies starting with Yisaipu 50 mg/week for nine months following Yisaipu 50 
mg/week, 25 mg/week or MTX maintenance were compared. Resource consumptions 
related to RA were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health care 
system. An endpoint of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response was 
used to estimate the utility scores. Uncertainty in model parameters was 
analysed by sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: When using ACR as an endpoint for determining successful treatment, 
strategies starting with Yisaipu 50 mg/week for nine months following Yisaipu 50 
mg/week or 25 mg/week maintenance showed the greatest number of QALYs gained 
(nearly 11.9 and 11.3 with or without rituximab after the failure of Yisaipu, 
respectively). If decision makers use a threshold of 3×the per capita GDP of 
China or Shanghai City in 2012, then the strategies most likely to be 
cost-effective are initial treatment with Yisaipu 50 mg/week for nine months 
following MTX maintenance and Yisaipu 25 mg/week maintenance, respectively. 
Results were sensitive to the cost of Yisaipu.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that, in China, replacing branded etanercept 
with Yisaipu is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in patients with 
moderately active RA.

[Geriatrics from the 19th to the 21st century. 150 years of geriatric medicine: 
from increasing life expectancy to improving quality of life for the very old].

[Article in French]

Federspiel C, Keipes M.

With the world further aging, geriatric medicine clearly became a necessity: in 
the 21th century many more people reach older ages by means of continued medical 
success in expanding lifespan. 150 years ago life expectancy was between 30 to 
40 years, but today close to 800 million people are 60 yeas old or more. During 
the last century aging has been associated with decline and decay, but gradually 
more people lived ably and healthily in older ages. The expansion in life 
expectancy has become a synchronism of quality of life: the average 65 year old 
today is much healthier, physically and mentally fitter, than the average 50 
year old 150 years ago, when Alois Alzheimer war born, a period when most 
nowadays existing geriatric institutions were envisioned and progressively 
realized over time. Today we strongly believe that a healthy life and, equally, 
the quality of life of the very old people can be extended with presently 
existing medical knowledge, based on research, environmental and behavioural 
changes, by postponing the onset and progression of fatal and disabling diseases 
and disorders. But very soon ethical considerations concerning all kinds of 
medical and technological solutions available to maintain or even improve the 
mental and physical functioning of dependant elderly people will engage our 
society when deciding how and at what moment in time to make the best decisions 
and allocate resources. Geriatric medicine will be further challenged by 
competing and demanding medical and economic needs, when marshalling resources 
to meet the growing demands of our society for improving care for the very old 
and often demented adult.

PURPOSE: Three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have recently become available in 
the United Kingdom as an alternative to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. This study examines the relative 
cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (BID dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on 
patient age), rivaroxaban, and apixaban from a UK payer perspective.
METHODS: A previously published model that follows up patients through treatment 
of atrial fibrillation during a lifetime was adapted to allow comparison of the 
3 NOACs and warfarin. Acute thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as 
long-term consequences of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and acute myocardial 
infarction, were tracked. Relative efficacy was calculated from a formal 
indirect treatment comparison using data from the 3 key trials (Randomized 
Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy, Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral 
direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of 
stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, and Apixaban for the 
Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) of the NOACs. Data 
from the rivaroxaban trial were adjusted for the difference in international 
normalized ratio control among warfarin patients versus the other 2 trials. 
Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted 
life-years.
FINDINGS: Among the patients taking NOACs, those taking dabigatran had the 
highest total QALYs (7.68 QALYs), followed by apixaban (7.63 QALYs) and 
rivaroxaban (7.47 QALYs). Patients taking dabigatran had the lowest total 
lifetime costs (£23,342), followed by apixaban (£24,014) and rivaroxaban 
(£25,220). The differences between dabigatran and apixaban were modest but 
consistent in sensitivity analyses, with the directionality only changing at the 
limits of the CIs for the relative risks of ischemic stroke or intracranial 
hemorrhage or when assuming that both treatment discontinuation and post-event 
disability rates differ by drug.
IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran was found to be economically dominant over rivaroxaban 
and apixaban in the UK setting. These economic findings are based on relative 
clinical efficacy from an indirect treatment comparison and would benefit from 
any data of direct comparisons of the NOACs in the future.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse relative survival, excess 
mortality and gain in life expectancy in men who underwent radical prostatectomy 
(RP) for localized prostate cancer (PCa) between 1995 and 2011 in Denmark.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population comprised the complete cohort of 6489 
men who underwent RP between 1995 and 2011. Risk of mortality was calculated 
using a competing risk model. Relative survival, excess mortality rate (EMR) and 
gain in life expectancy in men undergoing RP were calculated using a matched 
cohort Danish population based on date of birth and date of surgery.
RESULTS: During follow-up 328 patients died, 109 (33.2%) of PCa and 219 (66.8%) 
of other causes. The cumulative incidence of PCa mortality was 5.8% [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 4.4, 7.2] after 10 years. Relative survival was 
significantly above 1.0 for RP patients, except for high-risk patients. EMR was 
-9.34 (95% CI -10.56, -8.13) after 10 years, i.e. nine men would die in excess 
of the general population. Overall, the gain in life expectancy in men 
undergoing RP compared with the general population was 0.41 years.
CONCLUSION: This population-based study demonstrated that the gain in life 
expectancy with RP compared with the general population in Denmark is minimal.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced metastatic disease are often treated 
aggressively with multiple lines of chemotherapy, even in the last month of 
life. The benefit of such an approach remains uncertain. The objective of the 
study was to investigate whether Ruta graveolens 9c homeopathic medicine can 
improve quality of life (QoL) and tumour progression in patients with advanced 
cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, open-label, uncontrolled, pilot 
study. Patients (>18-years, life-expectancy ≥3 months, performance status ≤2) 
with locally-advanced solid tumours or metastases, previously treated with all 
available standard anti-cancer treatments were recruited. Oral treatment 
consisted of two 1-mL ampoules of Ruta graveolens (9c dilution) given daily for 
a minimum of 8 weeks, or until tumour and/or clinical progression. Primary 
outcome was QoL measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Secondary 
outcome measures were anxiety/depression measured using the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), WHO performance status (PS), tumour progression 
assessed using RECIST criteria and tumour markers, survival and tolerance.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included (mean age: 64.3 years). Mean duration 
of treatment was 3.3 months (median: 2.1). QoL global health status improved 
significantly between baseline and week 8 (P < 0.001) and week 16 (P = 0.035), 
but was at the limit of significance (P = 0.057) at the end of the study. There 
was no significant change in anxiety/depression or PS during treatment. Ruta 
graveolens 9c had no obvious effect on tumour progression. Median survival was 
6.7 months [95%CI: 4.8-14.9]. Ruta graveolens 9c was well-tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Some patients treated with Ruta graveolens 9c had a transitory 
improvement in QoL, but the effectiveness of this treatment remains to be 
confirmed in further studies.

To elucidate the effects of chemicals on populations of different species in the 
environment, efficient testing and modeling approaches are needed that consider 
multiple stressors and allow reliable extrapolation of responses across species. 
An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a concept that provides a framework for 
organizing knowledge about the progression of toxicity events across scales of 
biological organization that lead to adverse outcomes relevant for risk 
assessment. In this paper, we focus on exploring how the AOP concept can be used 
to guide research aimed at improving both our understanding of chronic toxicity, 
including delayed toxicity as well as epigenetic and transgenerational effects 
of chemicals, and our ability to predict adverse outcomes. A better 
understanding of the influence of subtle toxicity on individual and population 
fitness would support a broader integration of sublethal endpoints into risk 
assessment frameworks. Detailed mechanistic knowledge would facilitate the 
development of alternative testing methods as well as help prioritize higher 
tier toxicity testing. We argue that targeted development of AOPs supports both 
of these aspects by promoting the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their 
contribution to relevant toxicity outcomes across biological scales. We further 
discuss information requirements and challenges in application of AOPs for 
chemical- and site-specific risk assessment and for extrapolation across 
species. We provide recommendations for potential extension of the AOP framework 
to incorporate information on exposure, toxicokinetics and situation-specific 
ecological contexts, and discuss common interfaces that can be employed to 
couple AOPs with computational modeling approaches and with evolutionary life 
history theory. The extended AOP framework can serve as a venue for integration 
of knowledge derived from various sources, including empirical data as well as 
molecular, quantitative and evolutionary-based models describing species 
responses to toxicants. This will allow a more efficient application of AOP 
knowledge for quantitative chemical- and site-specific risk assessment as well 
as for extrapolation across species in the future.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if immediate postpartum (PP) intrauterine device (IUD) 
placement prevents pregnancy and is cost-effective compared with routine 
placement.
DESIGN: We developed a decision-analysis model to determine the number of 
pregnancies prevented and the cost-effectiveness of immediate PP IUD placement 
defined as within the first 10 minutes of placental expulsion compared with 
routine placement at the PP visit. Associated costs and probability estimates 
for adherence to PP follow-up, IUD placement, expulsion, and pregnancy were 
determined from the literature.
SETTING: Hospital and outpatient facility.
PATIENT(S): Women desiring PP IUDs.
INTERVENTION(S): IUD placement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome measure was the number of pregnancies 
prevented per 1,000 women. The secondary outcome was an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) defined as the marginal cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. An ICER of <$50,000/QALY gained was 
considered to be cost-effective.
RESULT(S): Immediate PP IUD placement prevented 88 unintended pregnancies per 
1,000 women over a 2-year time horizon. Immediate PP IUD placement was the 
dominant strategy. For every 1,000 women who desired a PP IUD, attempted 
immediate PP placement resulted in a cost savings of $282,540 and a gain of 10 
QALYs. The model is most sensitive to the cost of an undesired pregnancy. When 
the cost of a live birth is <$6,000, immediate placement is no longer 
cost-saving but remains cost-effective. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that 
immediate PP IUD placement is cost-effective in 99% of simulations.
CONCLUSION(S): Immediate PP IUD placement is a dominant strategy that prevents 
unintended pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: In children with single right ventricular (RV) anomalies, changes in 
RV size and function may be influenced by shunt type chosen at the time of the 
Norwood procedure.
OBJECTIVES: The study sought to identify shunt-related differences in 
echocardiographic findings at 14 months and ≤6 months pre-Fontan in survivors of 
the Norwood procedure.
METHODS: We compared 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic indices of RV 
size and function, neo-aortic and tricuspid valve annulus dimensions and 
function, and aortic size and patency at 14.1 ± 1.2 months and 33.6 ± 9.6 months 
in subjects randomized to a Norwood procedure using either the modified 
Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) or right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt 
(RVPAS).
RESULTS: Acceptable echocardiograms were available at both time points in 240 
subjects (114 MBTS, 126 RVPAS). At 14 months, all indices were similar between 
shunt groups. From the 14-month to pre-Fontan echocardiogram, the MBTS group had 
stable indexed RV volumes and ejection fraction, while the RVPAS group had 
increased RV end-systolic volume (p = 0.004) and decreased right ventricular 
ejection fraction (RVEF) (p = 0.004). From 14 months to pre-Fontan, the 
treatment groups were similar with respect to decline in indexed neo-aortic 
valve area, >mild neo-aortic valve regurgitation (<5% at each time), indexed 
tricuspid valve area, and ≥moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation (<20% at each 
time).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial Norwood shunt type influences pre-Fontan RV remodeling 
during the second and third years of life in survivors with single RV anomalies, 
with greater RVEF deterioration after RVPAS. Encouragingly, other indices of RV 
function remain stable before Fontan regardless of shunt type. (Comparison of 
Two Types of Shunts in Infants with Single Ventricle Defect Undergoing Staged 
Reconstruction-Pediatric Heart Network; NCT00115934).

BACKGROUND: Although many people survive an initial stroke, little is known 
about long-term impacts of stroke on survival.
METHODS: Data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health were used 
to compare 12-year survival rates in older women with prevalent stroke, incident 
stroke, and no stroke. Cox regression models were fitted to assess the effect of 
lifestyle and demographic characteristics on the relationship between stroke and 
all-cause mortality. The "no stroke" group was used as the reference category in 
all statistical models.
RESULTS: At baseline, 4% of the women reported a previous stroke (prevalent 
stroke). At survey 2 in 1999, a further 3% reported having a stroke between 1996 
and 1999 (incident stroke). Stroke was significantly associated with reduced 
long-term survival. Age-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) were: 1.64 (1.43-1.89) for 
the "prevalent stroke" group and 2.29 (1.97-2.66) for the "incident stroke" 
group. Adjusting for comorbidities reduced the HRs, but the risk of death was 
still significantly higher in the 2 stroke groups. Adjusting for demographic and 
lifestyle factors did not make any further difference to the relationship 
between stroke and survival. However, obesity and past smoking were also risk 
factors for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the long-term impacts of stroke on life 
expectancy and the importance of comorbidities and other lifestyle factors in 
affecting poststroke survival.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by autoantigen 
against the nicotine acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. With 
modern treatment facilities, the treatment effect and outcome for MG has been 
greatly improved with MG and non-MG patients enjoying the same life expectancy. 
Many classifications of disease distribution and severity have been set up and 
tested all over the world, mainly in the western world. However, the absolute 
and relative scoring system for evaluating the severity and treatment effect of 
MG in China where traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced for 
thousands of years has not been introduced worldwide. The TCM has achieved a 
great success in the treatment of MG in the country with a huge population. This 
article serves to introduce this scoring system to the world.

As the incidence of prostate cancer rises, the detection and management of men 
with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer is becoming increasingly 
important. The benefits of radical treatment have been clearly shown in this 
group from a number of publications. The current mainstays of treatment are 
radical prostatectomy (with selective use of adjuvant radiation) and radical 
radiotherapy with concurrent androgen deprivation. The outcomes from these two 
approaches seem to be remarkably similar and are considered equally valid 
options for primary treatment. The choice of therapy is critically dependent on 
a number of factors, but ultimately left to the decision of the patients with 
advice from clinicians. Clinicians themselves, however, are known to be biased 
towards their particular skill set and experiences. Attempts at randomised 
comparisons between these two modalities have so far failed and are confounded 
by patient-clinician bias, the continual advances in therapy as well as the long 
natural history of the disease. In the lack of level 1 comparable evidence, this 
article explores the existing literature as to the key factors that should be 
considered in radical treatment selection for high-risk prostate cancer. These 
factors include disease aggressiveness, comorbidity and life expectancy, 
functional outcomes and the consequences of therapy failure with regards to 
salvage treatment. We propose that these factors may be useful in developing a 
decision guide for rationale radical therapy selection in the light of two 
apparently equally effective treatments. Ultimately, however, there is an urgent 
need for added clinical and biological markers that can provide a more precise 
approach to therapy selection.

Limited lung resection for second primary lung cancer after pneumonectomy is a 
worthwhile procedure in appropriately selected patients because it carries a low 
operative risk and allows for longterm survival with good quality of life. 
Operations for metachronous cancers had a survival benefit that approximated the 
expected survival for primary lung cancer. The prognosis is poor for patients 
with N2 status and for those treated by second surgery earlier than 2 years 
after the first procedure. Careful selection of potential candidates for 
remaining lung surgery with special attention to functional cardiopulmonary 
reserve and lung cancer extension is mandatory for optimal early postoperative 
results and a long-term beneficial effect. Wedge resection with negative margins 
is the preferred procedure for peripheral tumors. Central tumors would benefit 
more from segmentectomy. With the exception of middle lobectomy, lobectomy 
should be avoided because of its negative impact on cardiopulmonary reserve and 
outcomes. In highly selected patients, surgical resection of a second primary 
NSCLC after pneumonectomy following these principles may achieve a 5-year 
survival rate of up to 63%. SBRT has shown promising early results as an 
alternative to surgical resection in inoperable patients.

Osteoporosis is being increasingly recognised in paediatric practice as a 
consequence of the increasing life expectancy of children who suffer from 
chronic diseases and other factors. There are many non-pharmacological measures 
that can improve children' bone health, for example, avoiding inflammatory 
activity and osteotoxic treatments; increasing sun exposure and weight-bearing 
exercise, and maintaining an adequate nutritional status. Vitamin D and calcium 
supplements have been proposed as a measure to increase bone mass, but their 
effect and therapeutic indications are not completely clear. On the other hand, 
bisphosphonates are currently the only pharmacological alternative for the 
patients with infantile secondary osteoporosis. However, more studies are 
required on the therapeutic indications, posology, and long term secondary 
effects of biphosphonates. The aim of this article is to analyze the scientific 
evidence of the effectiveness of the therapeutic alternatives for childhood 
secondary osteoporosis and their safety in children.

BACKGROUND: Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is increasingly used for the 
treatment of advanced elbow conditions to reduce pain and improve function. 
However, TEA is still associated with a higher complication rate than total hip 
and knee arthroplasty despite advances in the design and surgical techniques. 
This prospective clinical study reports the outcome of the Discovery Elbow 
System (Biomet, Warsaw IN, USA), which has been in clinical use in the United 
Kingdom since 2003.
METHODS: The study included a total of 100 Discovery Elbows (April 2003 to 
January 2010) with a minimum 2-year follow-up, including 75 primary and 25 
revisions (60% women and 40% men; mean age, 62 years). Outcome was assessed by 
means of the Liverpool Elbow Score, pain experience, patient satisfaction, range 
of motion, and radiographic imaging.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 48.5 months (range, 24-108 months). The 
Liverpool Elbow Score improved from 3.79 to 6.36 (P < .001). The percentage of 
pain-free patients was substantially increased from 7% preoperatively to 64% at 
the final follow-up. The patient satisfaction rate was over 90%. The 
flexion-extension arc and pronation-supination arc increased from 72° to 93° and 
from 86° to 111°, respectively (P < .001). Major postoperative complications 
included deep infection (2%), progressive aseptic loosening requiring revision 
(primary, 5%; revision 12%), persistent ulnar neuropathy (3%), and 
periprosthetic fracture (primary, 6.8%; revision, 8%).
CONCLUSION: The Discovery Elbow System resulted in improved function, reduced 
pain, and high patient satisfaction. Long-term results are required to assess 
the survivorship of this system.

Despite advances in coronary artery disease treatment and prevention, myocardial 
damage due to acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the population. Cell-based clinical trials to treat 
MI have focused on cells derived from the bone marrow or those potentially 
possessing functional similarities such as skeletal myoblasts or cardiac 
progenitors isolated from heart biopsies. Any benefits provided by these cells 
in improving heart function, left ventricular ejection fraction, or extending 
life expectancy after MI have been credited mostly to paracrine effects. 
Functional restoration of damaged myocardium will require a functional cell type 
with similar phenotype and characteristics of the damaged tissue that can also 
integrate, survive, and electrically couple to the host. Human pluripotent stem 
cells (hPSCs) have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types of the 
adult body. hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes represent a promising target population 
for cell-based therapies for MI because they are scalable and the product can be 
defined with a specific set of release criteria. The purpose of this article is 
to review the rationale for cell therapy in heart disease, discuss the 
properties of hPSC cardiomyocytes that define their usefulness for regenerative 
therapy, consider manufacturing issues and preclinical investigation, and 
finally examine the steps required to establish effective clinical 
implementation. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte-based therapies have 
enormous potential to revolutionize the management of heart disease; expedient 
but careful development is needed to ensure that this potential is fully 
realized.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and safety of the procedure for placing 
self-expanding stents in the colon. To evaluate the factors associated with 
complications. To analyze the dose of radiation delivered in the procedure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study of 478 
procedures done at a single center to place self-expanding metallic stents in 
the colon. A total of 423 nitinol stents and 79 stainless steel stents were 
placed. We included all colonic obstructions, of which 446 had malignant causes 
and 8 had benign causes. We excluded patients with intestinal perforation, 
severe colonic bleeding, short life expectancy, or lesions located less than 5 
cm from the anus. We collected the dosimetric data and analyzed the technical 
success, clinical success, and complications during follow-up.
RESULTS: The procedure was a technical success in 92.26% of cases (n=441) and a 
clinical success in 78.45% (n=375); complications occurred during follow-up in 
18.5% of cases. Complications occurred more frequently with the stainless steel 
stents than with the nitinol stents (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.8-5.7). The mean value 
of the dose area product was 35 Gy*cm(2). When instead of being done by the 
interventional radiologist working together with an endoscopist the procedure 
was done exclusively by the interventional radiologist, the time under 
fluoroscopy (p=0.001), dose area product (p=0.029), and kinetic energy released 
per unit mass (p=0.001) were greater.
CONCLUSION: The procedure for placing self-expanding colonic stents is 
efficacious and safe with an acceptable rate of complications. The doses of 
radiation delivered were low, and the radiation doses and time under fluoroscopy 
were lower when the procedure was done together with an endoscopist.

PURPOSE: Three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) is a significant 
advance in locally advanced cervical cancer treatment. However, its 
cost-effectiveness (C/E) is unknown. We performed a C/E analysis of IGBT 
compared with conventional (two-dimensional [2D]) brachytherapy in the treatment 
of locally advanced cervical cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to model locally advanced 
cervical cancer treated with five fractions of high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The 
model captured clinical parameters, quality of life utility, and treatment costs 
through the literature review. Costs were 2013 Medicare reimbursement. 
Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). To 
account for uncertainty, one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed. Strategies were evaluated from a payer's perspective 
with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.
RESULTS: Treatment costs for five fractions of IGBT and 2D brachytherapy were 
$21,374 and $17,931, respectively. In the base-case analysis, the IGBT strategy 
costs $3003 more than 2D brachytherapy while gaining 0.16 QALYs, resulting in an 
ICER of $18,634 per QALY gained. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were 
most sensitive to variation of treatment costs, but the ICER remained 
<$50,000/QALY gained for all cost ranges. Variation of survival, local control, 
and complication rates was less influential. A probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that IGBT was favored in 63% of model iterations at a 
$50,000/QALY gained threshold.
CONCLUSION: IGBT for locally advanced cervical cancer is a C/E option compared 
with 2D brachytherapy. These findings were robust to variation of parameter 
values supporting the routine use of IGBT in locally advanced cervical cancer.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) produce almost a million deaths a year in Latin 
America (LA), becoming the main cause of death in the last years, and it is 
estimated that the number of deaths in the region attributable to CVD will 
increase in the near future. This new epidemic is a consequence of the
