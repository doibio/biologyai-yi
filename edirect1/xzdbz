expectancy. Target tumors were followed with computed tomography at 1,3, and 6 
months after BAE. Endpoints included the best tumor response within 6 months as 
well as overall survivals in patients with and without tumor responses.
RESULTS: Best local responses within 6 months were complete response (CR) in 1 
patient, partial response (PR) in 16, stable disease (SD) in 24, and progressive 
disease (PD) in 1; the CR/PR rate was 40 % (17/42). Median follow-up period was 
13 months (range:1-43). Overall survival in patients with CR/PR was 
significantly better than in those with SD/PD (p = 0.006); with 3-year survival 
rates of 45 % (8/17) and 0% (0/25), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: BAE using NBCA has potential promise for shrinking hilar and/or 
mediastinal tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and 
may also improve overall survival in patients who respond.

The burden associated with frequent injections of current intravitreal (IVT) 
therapeutics may be reduced by long-acting delivery strategies. Binding to serum 
albumin has been shown to extend the ocular half-life in rabbits, however, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms and translational relevance remain unclear. The 
aim of this work was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo formation of 
complexes between human serum albumin (HSA) and an antigen-binding fragment of a 
rabbit antibody linked to an anti-HSA nanobody (FabA). The ocular and systemic 
pharmacokinetics of 3H-labeled FabA (0.05 mg/eye IVT) co-formulated with HSA (1 
and 15 nmol/eye) were assessed in Dutch belted rabbits. Next, FabA was incubated 
in vitreous samples from cynomolgus monkeys and human donors (healthy and 
diseased) supplemented with species-specific serum albumin. Finally, the 
FabA-albumin complexes formed in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by radio-size 
exclusion chromatography. A 3-fold increase in FabA vitreal exposure and 
half-life was observed in rabbits co-administered with 15 nmol HSA compared to 1 
nmol and a control arm. The different pharmacokinetic behavior was explained 
with the formation of higher molecular weight FabA-albumin complexes. The 
analysis of vitreous samples revealed the existence of predominantly 1:1 
complexes at endogenous or low concentrations of supplemented albumin. A shift 
towards 1:2 complexes was observed with increasing albumin concentrations. 
Overall, these results suggest that endogenous vitreal albumin concentrations 
are insufficient for half-life extension and warrant supplementation in the 
dosing formulation.

BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with major patient burden. Its treatment 
requires complex and collaborative approaches. A stepped care model based on the 
German National Clinical Practice Guideline "Unipolar Depression" has been shown 
to be effective. In this study we assess the cost-effectiveness of this 
guideline based stepped care model versus treatment as usual in depression.
METHODS: This prospective cluster-randomized controlled trial included 737 
depressive adult patients. Primary care practices were randomized to an 
intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The intervention consisted of a 
four-level stepped care model. The CG received treatment as usual. A 
cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective with a time horizon of 
12 months was performed. We used quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the 
EQ-5D-3L as effect measure. Resource utilization was assessed by patient 
questionnaires. Missing values were imputed by 'multiple imputation using 
chained equations' based on predictive mean matching. We calculated adjusted 
group differences in costs and effects as well as incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. To describe the statistical and decision uncertainty cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves were constructed based on net-benefit regressions with 
bootstrapped standard errors (1000 replications). The complete sample and 
subgroups based on depression severity were considered.
RESULTS: We found no statically significant differences in costs and effects 
between IG and CG. The incremental total societal costs (+€5016; 95%-CI: 
[-€259;€10,290) and effects (+ 0.008 QALY; 95%-CI: [- 0.030; 0.046]) were higher 
in the IG in comparison to the CG. Significantly higher costs were found in the 
IG for outpatient physician services and psychiatrist services in comparison to 
the CG. Significantly higher total costs and productivity losses in the IG in 
comparison to the CG were found in the group with severe depression. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for the IG in comparison to the CG were unfavourable 
(complete sample: €627.000/QALY gained; mild depression: dominated; moderately 
severe depression: €645.154/QALY gained; severe depression: €2082,714/QALY 
gained) and the probability of cost-effectiveness of the intervention was low, 
except for the group with moderate depression (ICER: dominance; 70% for 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for cost-effectiveness of the intervention in 
comparison to treatment as usual.

OBJECTIVE: Older people with hip fractures are often undernourished, which 
adversely affects their functional prognosis. A previous review reported that 
oral multinutritional supplements may prevent complications after hip fracture 
surgery. However, it is unclear whether interventions that combine 
rehabilitation and nutritional therapy have prognostic benefits. The objective 
of this study was to determine whether nutritional therapy is effective for 
patients with hip fractures undergoing rehabilitation.
DESIGN: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trials involving patients at 
least 65 years of age with hip fracture undergoing rehabilitation with or 
without nutritional therapy. Older patients with hip fractures undergoing 
rehabilitation were included.
METHODS: A systematic literature search using 5 databases (PubMed, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, WHO ICTRP, and Ichu-shi Web) was 
conducted in December 2018 and identified all randomized controlled trials. 
Outcome variables include mortality, complications, activities of daily living, 
quality of life, and muscle strength.
RESULTS: Of the 1431 studies found, 10 met the inclusion criteria, involving a 
total of 1119 patients. Four studies reported mortality, 5 studies reported 
complications, and 4 studies reported grip strength. Nutritional therapy showed 
a significant reduction in mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.39, 0.93; I2 = 0%] and complications (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44, 
1.03; I2 = 79%), and improved grip strength (mean difference = 2.01, 95% CI 
0.81, 3.22; I2 = 0%). The effects of nutritional therapy on activities of daily 
living, quality of life, and knee extension strength are unknown. The majority 
of studies were assessed as low quality.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study showed that the combination of 
rehabilitation and nutritional therapy for older patients with hip fractures 
reduced mortality and postoperative complications and enhanced grip strength, 
although the quality of the evidence was low. A well-designed controlled study 
is needed for further investigation.

AIMS: Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) is challenging to 
treat with suboptimal catheter ablation (CA) outcomes. Thoracoscopic surgical 
ablation (SA) has shown promising efficacy in atrial fibrillation (AF). This 
multicentre randomized controlled trial tested whether SA was superior to CA as 
the first interventional strategy in de novo LSPAF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 120 LSPAF patients to SA or CA. All patients 
underwent predetermined lesion sets and implantable loop recorder insertion. 
Primary outcome was single procedure freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia (AT) 
≥30 s without anti-arrhythmic drugs at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included 
clinical success (≥75% reduction in AF/AT burden); procedure-related serious 
adverse events; changes in patients' symptoms and quality-of-life scores; and 
cost-effectiveness. At 12 months, freedom from AF/AT was recorded in 26% (14/54) 
of patients in SA vs. 28% (17/60) in the CA group [OR 1.128, 95% CI (0.46-2.83), 
P = 0.83]. Reduction in AF/AT burden ≥75% was recorded in 67% (36/54) vs. 77% 
(46/60) [OR 1.13, 95% CI (0.67-4.08), P = 0.3] in SA and CA groups, 
respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse events within 30 days of 
intervention were reported in 15% (8/55) of patients in SA vs. 10% (6/60) in CA, 
P = 0.46. One death was reported after SA. Improvements in AF symptoms were 
greater following CA. Over 12 months, SA was more expensive and provided fewer 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with CA (0.78 vs. 0.85, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Single procedure thoracoscopic SA is not superior to CA in treating 
LSPAF. Catheter ablation provided greater improvements in symptoms and accrued 
significantly more QALYs during follow-up than SA.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between the burden of seven priority 
neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) included in the Brazilian National Agenda of 
Priorities in Health Research - tuberculosis, Chagas disease, leprosy, malaria, 
leishmaniasis, dengue and schistosomiasis - and their respective research 
funding and output.
METHODS: This retrospective review obtained data on disease burden from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study and funding data from open access sources. 
Publications were retrieved from Scopus and SciELO, and characterised according 
to the type of research conducted. Correlation between funding, research output 
and burden was assessed by comparing the 'expected' and 'observed' values for 
funding and publications relative to the proportional burden for each disease.
RESULTS: There was an emphasis in basic biomedical research (average 30% of 
publications) and a shortage of health policy and systems (average 7%) and 
social sciences research (average 3%). Research output and funding were poorly 
correlated with disease burden. Tuberculosis, Chagas disease and schistosomiasis 
accounted for more than 75% of total NTD-related DALYs, but accounted for only 
34% of publications. Leprosy, leishmaniasis and malaria, together, received 49% 
of NTD-related funding despite being responsible for only 9% of DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis evidenced a lack of correlation between disease 
burden, research output and government funding for priority NTDs in Brazil. Our 
findings highlight the importance of monitoring health needs, research 
investments and outputs to inform policy and optimise the uptake of evidence for 
action, particularly in developing countries, where resources are scarce and the 
research capacity is limited. The results contribute to health policy by 
highlighting the need for improving coordination of scientific activities and 
public health needs for effective impact.

Publisher: OBJECTIFS: Evaluer la corrélation entre la charge de sept maladies 
tropicales négligées (MTN) prioritaires incluses dans le programme national 
brésilien des priorités en matière de recherche en santé - tuberculose, maladie 
de Chagas, lèpre, paludisme, leishmaniose, dengue et schistosomiase - et leurs 
financements de recherche respectifs et les résultats. MÉTHODES: Cette revue 
rétrospective a obtenu des données sur la charge de morbidité de l'étude sur la 
Charge Globale des Maladies et des données de financement provenant de sources 
en accès publique. Les publications ont été extraites de Scopus et SciELO et 
caractérisées selon le type de recherche menée. La corrélation entre le 
financement, les résultats de la recherche et la charge a été évaluée en 
comparant les valeurs “attendues” et “observées” pour le financement et les 
publications par rapport à la charge proportionnel de chaque maladie. RÉSULTATS: 
L'accent a été mis sur la recherche biomédicale fondamentale (en moyenne 30% des 
publications) et une pénurie de politiques et de systèmes de santé (en moyenne 
7%) et de recherche en sciences sociales (en moyenne 3%). Les résultats et le 
financement de la recherche étaient mal associés à la charge de morbidité. La 
tuberculose, la maladie de Chagas et la schistosomiase représentaient plus de 
75% du total des EVCI, mais ne représentaient que 34% des publications. La 
lèpre, la leishmaniose et le paludisme, ensemble, ont reçu 49% des financements 
liés aux MTN alors qu'ils n'étaient responsables que de 9% des EVCI.
CONCLUSIONS: L’analyse a mis en évidence une absence de corrélation entre la 
charge de morbidité, le résultat de la recherche et le financement de la plupart 
des MTN. Nos résultats soulignent l'importance du suivi des besoins en matière 
de santé, des investissements dans la recherche et des résultats pour éclairer 
les politiques et optimiser l'utilisation des données pour l'action, en 
particulier dans les pays en développement, où les ressources sont rares et la 
capacité de recherche est limitée. Les résultats contribuent à la politique de 
santé en soulignant la nécessité d'améliorer la coordination et la planification 
stratégique des activités scientifiques pour un impact efficace.

INTRODUCTION: Intercalary endoprosthetic reconstructions have been reserved for 
patients with a limited life expectancy due to reports of high rates of early 
mechanical and reconstruction failure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 28 patients 
who underwent intercalary endoprosthetic reconstruction of the femur (n = 17) or 
tibia (n = 11) regarding reconstruction survival and causes of complications and 
reconstruction failure.
RESULTS: A total of 56 stems were implanted in this collective, 67.9% of which 
were implanted using cementation. Eight different stem designs were implanted. 
The mean patient age at the time of operation was 42.3 years. The mean bone 
defect needing reconstruction measured 18.5 cm. Resection margins were clear in 
96.4% of patients. Of twenty-six complications, five were not 
implant-associated. We observed infection in 10.7% (n = 3) and traumatic 
periprosthetic fracture in 3.6% (n = 1) of cases. The most frequent complication 
was aseptic stem loosening (ASL) (53.8%; n = 14) occurring in eight patients 
(28.6%). The metaphyseal and meta-diaphyseal regions of femur and tibia were 
most susceptible to ASL with a rate of 39.1% and 31.3% respectively. No ASLs 
occurred in epiphyseal or diaphyseal location. Overall reconstruction survival 
was 43.9% and 64.3% including patients who died of disease with their implant 
intact. Overall limb survival was 72.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Proper planning of segmental reconstructions including stem design 
with regard to unique anatomical and biomechanical properties is mandatory to 
address the high rates of ASL in metaphyseal and metadiaphyseal stem sites. With 
continued efforts of improving stem design in these implantation sites and 
decreasing rates of mechanical failure, indications for segmental 
megaendoprostheses may also extend to younger patients with the localized 
disease for their advantages of early weight bearing and a lack of donor-site 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: In the phase 3 trial ARIEL3, maintenance treatment with the 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor rucaparib provided clinical benefit 
versus placebo for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. 
Here, we evaluate the impact of age on the clinical utility of rucaparib in 
ARIEL3.
METHODS: Patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian carcinoma with ≥2 
prior platinum-based chemotherapies who responded to their last platinum-based 
therapy were enrolled in ARIEL3 and randomized 2:1 to rucaparib 600 mg twice 
daily or placebo. Exploratory, post hoc analyses of progression-free survival 
(PFS), patient-centered outcomes (quality-adjusted PFS [QA-PFS] and 
quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity [Q-TWiST]), and safety were 
conducted in three age subgroups (<65 years, 65-74 years, and ≥75 years).
RESULTS: Investigator-assessed PFS was significantly longer with rucaparib than 
placebo in patients aged <65 years (rucaparib n = 237 vs placebo n = 117; 
median, 11.1 vs 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.33 [95% confidence interval 
(95% CI) 0.25-0.43]; P < 0.0001) and 65-74 years (n = 113 vs n = 64; median, 8.3 
vs 5.3 months; HR 0.43 [95% CI 0.29-0.63]; P < 0.0001) and numerically longer in 
patients aged ≥75 years (n = 25 vs n = 8; median, 9.2 vs 5.5 months; HR 0.47 
[95% CI 0.16-1.35]; P = 0.1593). QA-PFS and Q-TWiST were significantly longer 
with rucaparib than placebo across all age subgroups. Safety of rucaparib was 
generally similar across the age subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy, patient-centered outcomes, and safety of rucaparib were 
similar between age subgroups, indicating that all eligible women with recurrent 
ovarian cancer should be offered this therapeutic option, irrespective of age.

INTRODUCTION: Healthcare systems aim to maximize the health of the population, 
but must work within constrained budgets. Therefore, choosing therapies that are 
both effective and cost-effective is paramount. The present analysis assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus 
once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg and versus once daily sitagliptin 100 mg for the 
treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on 
oral anti-hyperglycemic medications over patient lifetimes from a healthcare 
payer perspective in the Spanish setting.
METHODS: Cost and clinical outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using 
the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment 
effects on initiation of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 
sitagliptin 100 mg were based on the once-weekly semaglutide clinical trial 
program (SUSTAIN 7 and 2). Captured costs included treatment costs and costs of 
diabetes-related complications. Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.0% 
annually.
RESULTS: Projections of long-term clinical outcomes indicated that once-weekly 
semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life 
expectancy of 0.02 and 0.11 years, respectively, and discounted quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.03 and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Compared with sitagliptin, once-weekly 
semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life 
expectancy of 0.17 and 0.24 years, respectively and discounted quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.16 and 0.23 QALYs. The increased duration and quality of 
life with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg resulted from a reduced 
cumulative incidence and delayed time to onset of diabetes-related 
complications. Avoided complications resulted in once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg 
and 1 mg being cost-saving versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg and versus sitagliptin 
100 mg from a healthcare payer perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were considered dominant 
(more effective and less costly) versus sitagliptin 100 mg and dulaglutide 
1.5 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate 
glycemic control on oral anti-hyperglycemic medications and are likely to be a 
good use of healthcare resources in the Spanish setting.

Plain Language Summary: Since healthcare systems aim to maximize the health of 
the population but must work within constrained budgets, choosing therapies that 
are both effective and cost-effective is paramount. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness, from a Spanish healthcare payer perspective, of the newly 
marketed once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus two established 
therapies (dulaglutide 1.5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg) for the treatment of 
patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on oral 
anti-hyperglycemic medications over patient lifetimes.Outcomes were projected 
using a computer simulation model, based on two trials conducted as part of the 
once-weekly semaglutide clinical trial program (SUSTAIN 2 and SUSTAIN 7). 
Captured costs included treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related 
complications.Projections of long-term clinical outcomes indicated that 
once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.03 and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg, and 0.16 and 0.23 QALYs, 
respectively, versus sitagliptin 100 mg. The increased duration and quality of 
life with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg resulted from a reduced 
cumulative incidence and delayed time to onset of diabetes-related 
complications. Avoided complications resulted in once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg 
and 1 mg being cost-saving versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg and versus sitagliptin 
100 mg.Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were more effective and less 
costly and therefore were considered dominant in both comparisons, and are 
likely to be a good use of healthcare resources in the Spanish setting.

As a result of the extension of life span produced by increasing access to 
combined antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) face new 
challenges from comorbidities. Although advances in medical care for HIV 
infection have dramatically reduced opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining 
cancers, some non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) and specific oral diseases such 
as periodontitis and salivary gland disease are now more prevalent. Cancer 
prevention is, therefore, a priority issue in care of PLWH, stressing both 
restoration of immune function and reduction of non-HIV cancer risk factors 
(tobacco in all its forms; areca nut; heavy alcohol consumption; diets lacking 
antioxidant vitamins and minerals; and oncogenic virus infections) through 
specific interventions, especially tobacco and areca nut cessation and alcohol 
moderation. Detection of oral high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) and the 
universal preventive HPV vaccination among PLWH should be promoted to reduce the 
malignancy burden, along with routine oral examinations which remain the 
cheapest, most reliable, most reproducible, and non-invasive tool to identify 
suspicious lesions. Also, considerations of oral inflammation and periodontal 
health are important to replication and gene expression of viruses in the mouth. 
Considering that a key risk factor for this scenario is the presence of 
oncogenic virus infection such as several members of the human herpesvirus and 
human papillomavirus families, here we analyze the variables involved in the 
seeming increase in comorbidities in PLWH.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most effective systemic treatment for 
prostate cancer and can be succeeded either surgically or pharmaceutically. Both 
approaches lead to hypogonadism with a large variety of adverse events, 
including obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, diabetes 
mellitus, cardiovascular disease, gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction. In 
addition, undesirable effects on muscle and bone health may have a significant 
impact not only on the quality of life but also on life expectancy. Currently, 
supervised exercise seems to be the only intervention that could prevent the 
adverse effects of the ADT and improve quality of life. Lifestyle modification, 
supplementation of calcium, vitamin D and when indicated antiosteoporotic 
treatments improve bone health. However, patients receiving ADT must be well 
informed about the potential benefits as well as the risks of the treatment.

Venous stent placement of symptomatic occlusion of the superior and inferior 
vena cava is considered the treatment of choice in malignant disease because 
this technique can restore patency and achieve a relief of symptoms. However, 
tumor thrombus extension into the right atrium harbors the potential risk of 
stent migration and perforation. One strategy to avoid this potential 
life-threatening complication could be the placement of a bridging stent from 
the superior vena cava-to-inferior vena cava. This case reports describes the 
superior vena cava-to-inferior vena cava bridging stent technique in 2 patients 
with malignant occlusion of the superior and inferior vena cava. Special 
considerations such as technical details of the devices and potential 
complications are discussed.

Latvia: Health System Review.

and Policies.

This analysis of the Latvian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. After regaining independence in 1991, 
Latvia experimented with a social health insurance type system. However, to 
overcome decentralization and fragmentation of the system, the National Health 
Service (NHS) was established in 2011 with universal population coverage. More 
recently, reforms in 2017 proposed the introduction of a Compulsory Health 
Insurance System, with the objective of increasing revenues for health, which 
links access to different health care services to the payment of social health 
insurance contributions. In June 2019 the implementation of this proposal was 
postponed to 2021. Latvia has recovered from the severe economic recession of 
2008, which resulted in the adoption of austerity measures that significantly 
affected the health care system. The recovery has created fiscal space to focus 
on policy challenges neglected in the past, especially regarding health. Despite 
recent increases in spending, the health system remains underfunded and 
resources have to be allocated wisely. Latvia's health outcomes should be 
considered within this context of limited health system resources. While life 
expectancy at birth in Latvia has increased since 2000, reaching 74.9 years in 
2017, it remains among the lowest in the EU. Recent reforms have focused on 
improving access to services in rural/remote areas, increasing funding for 
health care services, and tougher regulation of tobacco and alcohol. However, a 
number of longstanding unresolved problems still need to be addressed, including 
financial sustainability and low public funding, high levels of unmet need, high 
rates of preventable and treatable mortality, and challenges in both 
communicable and noncommunicable diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To compare total costs for hospital stay and post-operative recovery 
between robotic and abdominal hysterectomy in the treatment of early-stage 
endometrial cancer provided in an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) 
setting. Costs were evaluated in relation to health impact, taking a societal 
perspective.
METHODS: Cost analysis was based on data from an open randomized controlled 
trial in an ERAS setting at a Swedish tertiary referral university hospital: 50 
women with low-risk endometrial cancer scheduled for surgery between February 
2012 and May 2016 were included; 25 women were allocated to robotic and 25 to 
abdominal hysterectomy. We compared the total time in the operating theater, 
procedure costs, post-operative care, length of hospital stay, readmissions, 
informal care, and sick leave as well as the health-related quality of life 
until 6 weeks after surgery. The comparison was made by using the EuroQoL group 
form with five dimensions and three levels (EQ-5D). The primary outcome measure 
was total cost; secondary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
cost per QALY. The costs were calculated in Swedish Krona (SEK).
RESULTS: Age (median (IQR) 68 (63-72) vs 67 (59-75) years), duration of hospital 
stay (ie, time to discharge criteria were met) (median (IQR) 36 (36-36) vs 36 
(36-54) hours), and sick leave (median (IQR) 25 (17-30) vs 31 (36-54) days) did 
not differ between the robotic and abdominal group. Time of surgery was 
significantly longer in the robotic group than in the abdominal group (median 
(IQR) 70 (60-90) vs 56 (49-84) min; p<0.05). The robotic group recovered 
significantly faster as measured by the EQ-5D health index and gained 0.018 
QALYs until 6 weeks after surgery. Total costs were 20% higher for the robotic 
procedure (SEK71 634 vs SEK59 319). The total cost per QALY gained for women in 
the robotic group was slightly under SEK700 000.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic hysterectomy used in an ERAS setting in the treatment of 
early endometrial cancer improved health within 6 weeks after the operation at a 
high cost for the health gained compared with abdominal hysterectomy. The 
productivity loss and informal care were lower for robotic hysterectomy, while 
healthcare had a higher procedure cost that could not be offset by the higher 
cost due to complications in the abdominal group.

Author information:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy has increased substantially. Elderly 
patients currently represent a large part of patients requiring emergency 
abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative 
outcomes of elderly patients who underwent appendectomy in a single French 
tertiary center.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who 
underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis between January 1, 1994 and 
December 31, 2014. We used the French threshold of ≥ 75 y-old to define elderly 
patients. Hence, elderly patients who underwent appendectomy were compared to 
the younger group.
RESULTS: During the study period, 2,060 consecutive patients underwent 
appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in 
52% of cases. Similar rates of laparoscopic approach were recorded in both 
groups, but conversion to open surgery was six times more frequent in elderly 
patients (17% vs. 3%; P < .0001). A higher incidence of complicated appendicitis 
was observed in the elderly group (63% vs. 13.6%; P < .0001). Complications 
occurred more frequently in the elderly group (46% vs. 8%; P < .0001). 30-d 
mortality was 0.15% for patients < 75 y and 6.15% for elderly patients (P < 
.0001). Unsuspected presence of an appendiceal neoplasm was higher (7.7%) in the 
elderly population.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the fact that appendicitis in the elderly is 
associated with a higher rate of complicated appendicitis, morbidity, and 
mortality.

Active surveillance and focal ablation for small renal masses: a better solution 
for comorbid patients.

The natural history of small renal masses (SRM) is still not well understood and 
they are frequently incidentally diagnosed in elderly patients. Therefore, there 
is a need for less invasive options sparing the patient from the side-effects 
related to conventional surgical treatment. PubMed and Medline database search 
was performed to look for new findings on active surveillance and focal therapy 
for SRM. Sixty-one articles published between 2002 and 2018 were selected for 
the purpose of the review. There is growing evidence confirming the safety of 
active surveillance in patients at surgical risk and there appears to be a 
satisfactory intermediate-term outcome of focal treatment of SRM. In the group 
of elderly patients with a decreased life expectancy active surveillance appears 
to be the most appropriate approach. The future of minimally invasive therapy 
appears bright, especially with the improvement of new imaging modalities.

expectancy projected to 2050 and does not consider age-weighting and 
time-discounting. Our aim is to estimate the burden of disease due to hip, knee, 
and unspecified osteoarthritis using this new method in the Peruvian Social 
Health Insurance System (EsSalud) during 2016. Methods: We followed the original 
1994 WHO study and the current 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) methods to 
estimate disability adjusted life years (DALY) due to osteoarthritis, 
categorized by sex, age, osteoarthritis type, and geographical area. We used 
disability weights employed by the Peruvian Ministry of Health, and the last 
update issued by WHO. Results: Overall, EsSalud reported 17.9 new cases of 
osteoarthritis per 1000 patients per year. Annual incidence was 23.7/1000 among 
women, and 72.6/1000 in people above 60 years old. Incidence was 5.6/1000 for 
knee osteoarthritis and 1.1/1000 for hip. According to the 1994 WHO method, 
there were 399,884 DALYs or 36.6 DALYs/1000 patients per year due to 
osteoarthritis. 12.4 and 2.2 DALYs/1000 patients per-year were estimated for 
knee and hip osteoarthritis, respectively. Using the 2015 GBD method, there were 
1,037,865 DALYs or 94.9 DALYs/1000 patients per year. 31.4 and 5.3 DALYs/1000 
patients per year were calculated for knee and hip osteoarthritis, respectively. 
Conclusions: In the Peruvian social health insurance subsystem, hip, knee, and 
unspecified osteoarthritis produced a high burden of disease, especially among 
women and patients over 60. The 2015 GBD methodology yields values almost three 
times higher than the original recommendations.
