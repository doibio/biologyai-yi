osmotic stress. Reproductive rates at 16°C were lower than those at 22°C, but 
because they reproduce longer, there is no significant change in the lifetime 
fecundity of females. To investigate which genes contribute to these effects, 
the expression of specific temperature sensing genes was knocked down using 
RNAi. Of 12 genes tested, RNAi knockdown of four eliminated the survival 
enhancing effects of the four-day cold treatment: TRP7, forkhead box C, Y-box 
factor, and ribosomal protein S6. This demonstrates that active gene regulation 
is an important factor in temperature mediated life extension, and that these 
particular genes play an integral role in these pathways. As a thermoresponsive 
sensor, TRP7 may be responsible for triggering the signaling cascade 
contributing to temperature mediated life extension. The TRP genes may also 
provide especially promising candidates for targeted gene manipulations or 
pharmacological interventions capable of mimicking the effects of low 
temperature exposure. These results support recent theories of aging that claim 
rate of aging is determined by an actively regulated genetic mechanism rather 
than an accumulation of molecular damage.

Aim The aim of this study was to describe the experiences and meaning of using 
mobile phones in everyday life after stroke, among persons with stroke and their 
family members. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted 
among 11 persons with stroke and 9 family members 2 months to 2 years after the 
stroke. The interviews were analysed by using constant comparative grounded 
theory (GT) approach. Results Seven categories were identified from the analysis 
of the participants' experiences. The mobile phone: (1) as an enabler of 
communication and connections with other people, (2) a source of inspiration for 
agency, (3) structuring routine and activities in daily life, (4) as a 
facilitator of social and economic wellbeing of an individual or family, (5) 
promoter of belonging and participation in social relationships, (6) facilitator 
of reintegration to community living and (7) enabler of family members to feel 
secure. From these categories, a core category emerged: The mobile phone as a 
"life line" and an extension of the body enabling connection, belonging and 
agency to act in a complex everyday life situation. Conclusion The study gives 
support for the possibility of using mobile phones to facilitate change and 
community integration in the rehabilitation process after stroke. Implications 
for Rehabilitation Stroke leads to decreased functioning in everyday life due to 
impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions as well 
caregiver burden. Mobile phones seem to be an accessible and affordable 
technology used in daily life of persons with stroke and family members and 
connects them to the needed services and social relationships. The mobile phone 
technology reduces resource and infrastructural challenges and increases 
accessibility to rehabilitation interventions. The mobile phone was an important 
instrument that facilitated the quality of life of persons with stroke and their 
family members and could increase their participation in rehabilitation 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder is a severe and chronic mental health problem 
that persists into older adulthood. The number of people living with this 
condition is set to rise as the UK experiences a rapid ageing of its population. 
To date, there has been very little research or service development with respect 
to psychological therapies for this group of people.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing a 
14-session, 6-month Recovery-focused Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Older 
Adults with bipolar disorder (RfCBT-OA) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU 
alone. Participants will be recruited in the North-West of England via primary 
and secondary mental health services and through self-referral. The primary 
objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
RfCBT-OA; therefore, a formal power calculation is not appropriate. It has been 
estimated that randomising 25 participants per group will be sufficient to be 
able to reliably determine the primary feasibility outcomes (eg, recruitment and 
retention rates), in line with recommendations for sample sizes for 
feasibility/pilot trials. Participants in both arms will complete assessments at 
baseline and then every 3 months, over the 12-month follow-up period. We will 
gain an estimate of the likely effect size of RfCBT-OA on a range of clinical 
outcomes and estimate parameters needed to determine the appropriate sample size 
for a definitive, larger trial to evaluate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of RfCBT-OA. Data analysis is discussed further in the 
Analysis section in the main paper.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the UK National Health 
Service (NHS) Ethics Committee process (REC ref: 15/NW/0330). The findings of 
the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and 
international conference presentations and local, participating NHS trusts.

The Modern Criteria for Medical Management of Acromegaly.

Acromegaly is an insidious disorder characterized by excess secretion of growth 
hormone (GH) and elevated circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I 
(IGF-I), generally caused by a pituitary adenoma. It is a rare disease 
associated with an average 10-year reduction in life expectancy due to 
metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular comorbidities and reduced quality 
of life caused by paresthesias, fatigue, osteoarthralgia, or bone fractures. In 
2000, Cortina Consensus Conference established general criteria for diagnosis 
and biochemical control of acromegaly, which have been revised in recent years, 
adapting them to emerging clinical evidences as well as the evolving assay 
techniques. Authors have proposed a binary definition of cure for acromegaly, 
where both GH and IGF-I are important determinants: the former is more linked to 
the presence of residual adenomatous tissue, while the latter to the peripheral 
activity of the disease. Control of tumor growth and complications is also an 
essential goal of treatment. Surgical, medical, and radiotherapy approaches are 
all valid alternatives. The surgical option is, however, unsuccessful in about 
50% of patients. Somatostatin analogs (SRLs), octreotide LAR, and lanreotide ATG 
can inhibit cell growth, besides their beneficial effects on GH hypersecretion 
and on most comorbidities. Pasireotide is a new multireceptor-targeted SRL with 
reported superior biochemical efficacy to octreotide, due to higher affinity for 
SSTR-5, but potentially causing detrimental effects on glucose homeostasis. 
Pegvisomant could be a valid choice in all patients resistant to SRLs. It is a 
competitive GH antagonist, which efficaciously blocks IGF-I production, 
inhibiting the dimerization of GH receptor. Normal IGF-I levels represent, 
therefore, its only relevant efficacy endpoint, while only few cases of tumor 
growth on pegvisomant have been reported, so far.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) may not 
completely reflect the value of a healthcare technology, it remains unclear how 
to adjust the cost per QALY threshold. First, the present study compares two 
survey methods of measuring people's preferences for a specific healthcare 
technology when each choice has the same efficiency. The second objective was to 
consider how this information regarding preferences could be used in decision 
making.
METHODS: We conducted single-attribute (budget allocation) and multi-attribute 
(discrete-choice) experiments to survey public medical care preferences. 
Approximately 1000 respondents were sampled for each experiment. Six questions 
were prepared to address the attributes included in the study: (a) age; (b) 
objective of care; (c) disease severity; (d) prior medical care; (e) cause of 
disease; and (f) disease frequency. For the discrete-choice experiment (a) age, 
(b) objective of care, (c) disease severity, and (d) prior medical care were 
orthogonally combined. All assumed medical care had the same costs and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per life-year or QALY). We also 
calculated the preference-adjusted threshold (PAT) to reflect people's 
preferences in a threshold range.
RESULTS: The results of both experiments revealed similar preferences: 
intervention for younger patients was strongly preferred, followed by 
interventions for treatment and severe disease states being preferred, despite 
the same cost per life-year or QALY. The single-attribute experiment revealed 
that many people prefer an option in which resources are equally allocated 
between two interventions. Marginal PATs were calculated for age, objective of 
care, disease severity, and prior medical care.
CONCLUSION: The single- and multi-attribute experiments revealed similar 
preferences. PAT can reflect people's preferences within the decision-maker's 
threshold range in a numerical manner.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has 
modified the clinical course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
reducing the rate of disease progression, the incidence of opportunistic 
infections and mortality. Several recent studies show early antiretroviral 
therapy reduces the risk of AIDS and HIV-related disease. The aim of this study 
was to perform an economic analysis to estimate the cost-utility of early 
antiretroviral therapy in Italy for managing HIV-infected patients.
METHODS: The incremental cost-utility analysis was carried out to quantify the 
benefits of the early-treatment approach in HIV subjects. A Markov simulation 
model including direct costs and health outcomes was developed from a 
third-party (Italian National Healthcare Service) payer's perspective for four 
CD4 strata. 5000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two distinct 
scenarios: Standard of care (SoC) in which 30% of patients started HAART with a 
CD4 count ≥500 cells/mm(3) versus the early-treatment scenario (ETS), where the 
number of patients starting HAART with a CD4 count ≥500 cells/mm(3) increased to 
70%. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify epidemiological 
and economic data, which were subsequently used to inform the model. In 
addition, a one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to 
measure the relationship between the effectiveness of the treatments and the 
number of patients to undergo early treatment.
RESULTS: The model shows, in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, that early treatment 
appeared to be the most cost-effective option compared to SoC (ICER = €13,625) 
over a time horizon of 10 years. The cost effectiveness of ETS is more 
sustainable as it extends the time horizon analysis (ICER = €7526 per QALY to 20 
years and €8382 per QALY to 30 years). The one-way sensitivity analysis on the 
main variables confirmed the robustness of the model for the early-treatment 
approach.
CONCLUSION: Our model represents a tool for policy makers and health-care 
professionals to provide information on the cost effectiveness of the 
early-treatment approach in HIV-infected patients in Italy. Starting HAART 
earlier keeps HIV-infected patients in better health and reduces the incidence 
of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events, generating a gain in terms of both 
patients' health and correct resource allocation.

Sepsis is a frequent cause of death in very-low-birthweight infants and often 
results in neurological impairment. Its attributable risk of sequelae has not 
been systematically assessed. To establish an outcome tree for mapping the 
burden of neonatal sepsis, we performed systematic literature searches to 
identify systematic reviews addressing sequelae of neonatal sepsis. We included 
cohort studies and performed meta-analyses of attributable risks. Evidence 
quality was assessed using GRADE. Two systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. 
The first included nine cohort studies with 5,620 participants and five outcomes 
(neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebral palsy, vision impairment, hearing 
impairment, death). Pooled risk differences varied between 4% (95% confidence 
interval (CI):2-10) and 13% (95% CI:5-20). From the second review we analysed 
four studies with 472 infants. Positive predictive value of neurodevelopmental 
impairment for later cognitive impairment ranged between 67% (95% CI:22-96) and 
83% (95% CI:36-100). Neonatal sepsis increases risk of permanent neurological 
impairment. Effect size varies by outcome, with evidence quality being low to 
very low. Data were used to construct an outcome tree for neonatal sepsis. 
Attributable risk estimates for sequelae following neonatal sepsis are suitable 
for burden estimation and may serve as outcome parameters in interventional 
studies.

Guidelines for optimal cancer screening in older adults remain unclear, 
particularly for adults over the age of 75. While cancer screening in older 
adults may benefit some in good health, it may cause unnecessary burdens in 
others with limited life expectancy. Thus, a systematic approach to enable 
individualized cancer screening decisions in older adults is needed. We suggest 
a framework that guides such decisions through evidence-based approaches from 
multiple interactions, and that involves the patient, clinician, and healthcare 
system. An individualized approach considers differences in disease risk rather 
than the chronological age of the patient. This paper presents a comprehensive 
framework that depicts the independent and converging levels of influences on 
individualized cancer screening decisions in older adults. This Individualized 
Decisions for Screening (IDS) framework recognizes the reality of these 
interrelationships, including the tensions that arise when behaviors and 
outcomes are valued differently at the patient, clinician, and healthcare 
organization levels. Person-centered approaches are essential to advancing 
multilevel research of individualized cancer screening decisions among older 
adults.

INTRODUCTION: End-of-life (EOL) decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
is difficult, but is rarely practiced in simulated settings. We wanted to 
explore different strategies ICU physicians use when making EOL decisions, and 
whether attitudes towards EOL decisions differ between a small-group simulation 
setting and a large-group plenary setting.
METHODS: The study took place during a Scandinavian anaesthesiology and 
intensive care conference. The simulated ICU patient had a cancer disease with a 
grave prognosis, had undergone surgery, suffered from severe co-morbidities and 
had a son present demanding all possible treatment. The participants were asked 
to make a decision regarding further ICU care. We presented the same case 
scenario in a plenary session with voting opportunities.
RESULTS: In the simulation group (n = 48), ICU physicians used various 
strategies to come to an EOL decision: patient-oriented, family-oriented, 
staff-oriented and regulatory-oriented. The simulation group was more willing 
than the plenary group (n = 47) to readmit the patient to the ICU if the patient 
again would need respiratory support (32% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). Still, fewer 
participants in the simulation group than in the plenary group (21% vs. 38%, P = 
0.019) considered the patient's life expectancy of living an independent life to 
be over 10%.
CONCLUSION: There was great variation between ICU physicians in the approach to 
making EOL decisions, and large variations in their life expectancy estimates. 
Participants in the simulation group were more willing to admit and readmit the 
patient to the ICU, despite being more pessimistic towards life expectancies. We 
believe simulation can be used more extensively in EOL decision-making training.

Mind Invasion: Situated Affectivity and the Corporate Life Hack.

Slaby J(1).

Author information:
(1)Philosophy, Free University Berlin Berlin, Germany.

In view of the philosophical problems that vex the debate on situated 
affectivity, it can seem wise to focus on simple cases. Accordingly, theorists 
often single out scenarios in which an individual employs a device in order to 
enhance their emotional experience, or to achieve new kinds of experience 
altogether, such as playing an instrument, going to the movies, or sporting a 
fancy handbag. I argue that this narrow focus on cases that fit a "user/resource 
model" tends to channel attention away from more complex and also more 
problematic instances of situated affectivity. Among these are scenarios in 
which a social domain draws individuals into certain modes of affective 
interaction, often by way of attunement and habituation to affective styles and 
interaction patterns that are normative in the domain in question. This can lead 
to a phenomenon that is not so much "mind extension" than "mind invasion": 
affectivity is dynamically framed and modulated from without, often contrary to 
the prior orientations of the individuals in question. As an example, I discuss 
affective patterns prevalent in today's corporate workplace. I claim that 
workplace affect sometimes contributes to what is effectively a "hack" of 
employees' subjectivity.

As the life expectancy continues to increase, the cognitive decline associated 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a big major issue in the world. After 
cellular activation upon systemic inflammation, microglia, the resident immune 
cells in the brain, start to release proinflammatory mediators to trigger 
neuroinflammation. We have found that chronic systemic inflammatory challenges 
induce differential age-dependent microglial responses, which are in line with 
the impairment of learning and memory, even in middle-aged animals. We thus 
raise the concept of "microglia aging." This concept is based on the fact that 
microglia are the key contributor to the acceleration of cognitive decline, 
which is the major sign of brain aging. On the other hand, inflammation induces 
oxidative stress and DNA damage, which leads to the overproduction of reactive 
oxygen species by the numerous types of cells, including macrophages and 
microglia. Oxidative stress-damaged cells successively produce larger amounts of 
inflammatory mediators to promote microglia aging. Nutrients are necessary for 
maintaining general health, including the health of brain. The intake of 
antioxidant nutrients reduces both systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation 
and thus reduces cognitive decline during aging. We herein review our microglia 
aging concept and discuss systemic inflammation and microglia aging. We propose 
that a nutritional approach to controlling microglia aging will open a new 
window for healthy brain aging.

Proximal duplications of chromosome 1q are rare chromosomal abnormalities. Most 
patients with this condition present with neurological, urogenital, and 
congenital heart disease and short life expectancy. Mosaicism for trisomy 
1q10q23.3 has only been reported once in the literature. Here we discuss a 
second case: a girl with a postnatal diagnosis of a de novo pure mosaic trisomy 
1q1023.3 who has no urogenital or cardiac anomalies.

INTRODUCTION: Anal cancer in men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV is 
an important issue but there are no consistent guidelines for how to screen for 
this cancer. In settings where screening with anal cytology is unavailable, 
regular anal examinations have been proposed in some guidelines but their 
cost-effectiveness is unknown.
METHODS: Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of regular anal 
examinations to screen for anal cancer in HIV-positive MSM living in Australia 
using a probabilistic Markov model. Data sources were based on the medical 
literature and a clinical trial of HIV-positive MSM receiving an annual anal 
examination in Australia. The main outcome measures for calculating 
effectiveness were undiscounted and discounted (at 3%) lifetime costs, life 
years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Base-case analysis estimated the average cost of screening for and 
management of anal cancer ranged from $195 for no screening to $1,915 for 
lifetime annual screening of men aged ≥ 50. Screening of men aged ≥ 50 generated 
ICERs of $29,760 per QALY gained (for screening every four years), $32,222 
(every three years) and $45,484 (every two years). Uncertainty for ICERs was 
mostly influenced by the cost (financially and decrease in quality of life) from 
a false-positive result, progression rate of anal cancer, specificity of the 
anal examination, the probability of detection outside a screening program and 
the discount rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for anal cancer by incorporating regular anal 
examinations into routine HIV care for MSM aged ≥ 50 is most likely to be 
cost-effective by conventional standards. Given that anal pap smears are not 
widely available yet in many clinical settings, regular anal exams for MSM 
living with HIV to detect anal cancer earlier should be implemented.

As medical technology continues increasing the possibility of living a longer 
life, the public's valuing of these developments must be considered. This study 
examines attitudes toward extending the human life span within a student 
population at a Christian university. Religious factors were hypothesized to 
affect life extension desirability. Scores on measures of willingness to defer 
to God's will, meaning derived from religion, positive afterlife beliefs, and 
intrinsic religiosity were significantly and inversely related to life extension 
desirability. Implications of these findings are discussed, including 
encouraging medical practitioners to respect decision-making processes of 
religious persons who may find life extension interventions undesirable.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) is a function of age, disability, and co-morbidity, combined with leukemia 
characteristics. There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal 
therapeutic strategy for older adults with AML. Although selected older adults 
with AML can benefit from intensive therapies, recent evidence supports the use 
of lower-intensity therapies in most patients and emphasizes the importance of 
tolerability and quality of life.
AREAS COVERED: Results of the current clinical trials and safety data are 
reviewed.
EXPERT OPINION: Treatment recommendations for elderly patients with AML need to 
be individualized. In order to avoid toxicities, hematologists should 
collaborate more with geriatricians to identify clues of vulnerability in 
elderly patients through the study of functional physical, physiological, 
cognitive, social, and psychological parameters.

Replacement in the UK: A Study Using the NJR Dataset.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness or 
cost-effectiveness of alternative brands of prosthesis for total knee 
replacement (TKR). We compared patient-reported outcomes, revision rates, and 
costs, and estimated the relative cost-effectiveness of five frequently used 
cemented brands of unconstrained prostheses with fixed bearings (PFC Sigma, AGC 
Biomet, Nexgen, Genesis 2, and Triathlon).
METHODS: We used data from three national databases for patients who had a TKR 
between 2003 and 2012, to estimate the effect of prosthesis brand on 
post-operative quality of life (QOL) (EQ-5D-3L) in 53 126 patients at six 
months. We compared TKR revision rates by brand over 10 years for 239 945 
patients. We used a fully probabilistic Markov model to estimate lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs), and the probability that each prosthesis brand is the most cost 
effective at alternative thresholds of willingness-to-pay for a QALY gain.
FINDINGS: Revision rates were lowest with the Nexgen and PFC Sigma (2.5% after 
10 years in 70-year-old women). Average lifetime costs were lowest with the AGC 
Biomet (£9 538); mean post-operative QOL was highest with the Nexgen, which was 
the most cost-effective brand across all patient subgroups. For example, for 
70-year-old men and women, the ICERs for the Nexgen compared to the AGC Biomet 
were £2 300 per QALY. At realistic cost per QALY thresholds (£10 000 to £30 
000), the probabilities that the Nexgen is the most cost-effective brand are 
about 98%. These results were robust to alternative modelling assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: AGC Biomet prostheses are the least costly cemented unconstrained 
fixed brand for TKR but Nexgen prostheses lead to improved patient outcomes, at 
low additional cost. These results suggest that Nexgen should be considered as a 
first choice prosthesis for patients with osteoarthritis who require a TKR.

    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021 Sep 17;9:CD009806.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI or Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome is a rare 
genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of arylsulphatase B. The resultant 
accumulation of dermatan sulphate causes lysosomal damage.The clinical symptoms 
are related to skeletal dysplasia (i.e. short stature and degenerative joint 
disease). Other manifestations include cardiac disease, impaired pulmonary 
function, ophthalmological complications, hepatosplenomegaly, sinusitis, otitis, 
hearing loss and sleep apnea. Intellectual impairment is generally absent. 
Clinical manifestation is typically by two or three years of age; however, 
slowly progressive cases may not present until adulthood.Enzyme replacement 
therapy with galsulfase is considered a new approach for treating 
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating 
mucopolysaccharidosis VI by enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase compared 
to other interventions, placebo or no intervention.
SEARCH METHODS: Eletronic searches were performed on the Cystic Fibrosis and 
Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, in 
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease and 
ClinicalTrials.gov. Date of the last search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic 
Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 05 February 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical studies 
of enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase compared to other interventions or 
placebo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the studies, 
assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: One study was included involving 39 participants who received 
either enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase (recombinant human 
arylsulphatase B) or placebo. This small study was considered to be of overall 
unclear quality, since the authors did not report how both the allocation 
generation and concealment were performed.The key finding at 24 weeks in the 
12-minute walk test was a statistically significant mean difference of 92.00 
meters between the two groups in favour of the galsulfase group (95% confidence 
interval 11.00 to 172.00). While week 24 results for the three-minute stair 
climb demonstrated some improvement in the treatment group as compared to the 
placebo group, this was not significant, mean difference 5.70 (95% confidence 
interval -0.10 to 11.50).A significant decrease in the urinary glycosaminoglycan 
levels was observed in favour of the galsulfase group at 24 weeks, mean 
difference -227.00 (95% confidence interval -264.00 to -190.00).In general, the 
dose of galsulfase was well tolerated and there were no significant differences 
in relation to adverse events. These events include drug-related adverse events, 
serious and severe adverse events, those during infusion, drug-related adverse 
events during infusion, and deaths. More infusion-related reactions were 
observed in the galsulfase group and were managed with interruption or slowing 
of infusion rate or administration of antihistamines or corticosteroids drugs. 
No deaths occurred during the study.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of one small study (based on 24-week 
randomised phase of the study and prior to the open-label extension) 
demonstrated that galsulfase is more effective than placebo in people with MPS 
VI, with significant improvements in the 12-minute walk test and a reduction in 
urinary glycosaminoglycans.There were no significant changes in cardiac or 
pulmonary functions, liver or spleen volume, overnight apnea-hypopnea, height 
and weight, quality of life and adverse effects.Further studies are needed to 
obtain more information on the long-term effectiveness and safety of enzyme 
replacement therapy with galsulfase.

With the progressive increase in life-expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-positive patients in the "highly active antiretroviral therapy" (HAART) 
era, co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD) are 
emerging as an important concern. The pathophysiology of CVD in this population 
is complex, due to the interaction of classical CV risk factors, viral infection 
and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The role of ARV drugs in HIV is 
double edged. While these drugs reduce systemic inflammation, an important 
factor in CV development, they may at the same time be proatherogenic by 
inducing dyslipidemia, body fat redistribution and insulin resistance. In these 
patients primary prevention is challenging, considering the lower median age at 
which acute coronary syndromes occur. Furthermore prevention is still limited by 
the lack of robust evidence-based, HIV-specific recommendations. Therefore we 
performed a comprehensive evaluation of the literature to analyze current 
knowledge on CVD prevalence in HIV-infected patients, traditional and 
HIV-specific risk factors and risk stratification, and to summarize the 
recommendations for primary prevention of CVD in this HIV population.

BACKGROUND: Europe once had widespread malaria, but today it is free from 
endemic transmission. Changing land use, agricultural practices, housing 
quality, urbanization, climate change, and improved healthcare are among the 
many factors thought to have played a role in the declines of malaria seen, but 
their effects and relative contributions have rarely been quantified.
METHODS: Spatial datasets on changes in climate, wealth, life expectancy, 
urbanization, and land use trends over the past century were combined with 
datasets depicting the reduction in malaria transmission across 31 European 
countries, and the relationships were explored. Moreover, the conditions in 
current malaria-eliminating countries were compared with those in Europe at the 
time of declining transmission and elimination to assess similarities.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Indicators relating to socio-economic improvements such as 
wealth, life expectancy and urbanization were strongly correlated with the 
decline of malaria in Europe, whereas those describing climatic and land use 
changes showed weaker relationships. Present-day malaria-elimination countries 
have now arrived at similar socio-economic indicator levels as European 
countries at the time malaria elimination was achieved, offering hope for 
achievement of sustainable elimination.

Differing limb proportions in terms of length and mass, as well as differences 
in mass being concentrated proximally or distally, influence the limb's moment 
of inertia (MOI), which represents its resistance to being swung. Limb 
morphology - including limb segment proportions - thus probably has direct 
relevance for the metabolic cost of swinging the limb during locomotion. 
However, it remains largely unexplored how differences in limb proportions 
influence limb kinematics during swing phase. To test whether differences in 
limb proportions are associated with differences in swing phase kinematics, we 
collected hindlimb kinematic data from three species of charadriiform birds 
differing widely in their hindlimb proportions: lapwings, oystercatchers and 
avocets. Using these three species, we tested for differences in maximum joint 
flexion, maximum joint extension and range of motion (RoM), in addition to 
differences in maximum segment angular velocity and excursion. We found that the 
taxa with greater limb MOI - oystercatchers and avocets - flex their limbs more 
than lapwings. However, we found no consistent differences in joint extension 
and RoM among species. Likewise, we found no consistent differences in limb 
segment angular velocity and excursion, indicating that differences in limb 
inertia in these three avian species do not necessarily underlie the rate or 
extent of limb segment movements. The observed increased limb flexion among 
these taxa with distally heavy limbs resulted in reduced MOI of the limb when 
compared with a neutral pose. A trade-off between exerting force to actively 
flex the limb and potential savings by a reduction of MOI is skewed towards 
reducing the limb's MOI as a result of MOI being in part a function of the 
radius of gyration squared. Increased limb flexion is a likely means to lower 
the cost of swinging the limbs.

    Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2016 May;13(5):270-2.

BACKGROUND: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of treating incident chronic 
myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) with generic imatinib when it becomes 
available in United States in 2016. In the year following generic entry, 
imatinib's price is expected to drop 70% to 90%. We hypothesized that initiating 
treatment with generic imatinib in these patients and then switching to the 
other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib or nilotinib, because of 
intolerance or lack of effectiveness ("imatinib-first") would be cost-effective 
compared with the current standard of care: "physicians' choice" of initiating 
treatment with any one of the three TKIs.
METHODS: We constructed Markov models to compare the five-year 
cost-effectiveness of imatinib-first vs physician's choice from a US commercial 
payer perspective, assuming 3% annual discounting ($US 2013). The models' 
clinical endpoint was five-year overall survival taken from a systematic review 
of clinical trial results. Per-person spending on incident CML-CP treatment 
overall care components was estimated using Truven's MarketScan claims data. The 
main outcome of the models was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We 
interpreted outcomes based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. A 
panel of European LeukemiaNet experts oversaw the study's conduct.
RESULTS: Both strategies met the threshold. Imatinib-first ($277 401, 3.87 
QALYs) offered patients a 0.10 decrement in QALYs at a savings of $88 343 over 
five years to payers compared with physician's choice ($365 744, 3.97 QALYs). 
The imatinib-first incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately $883 
730/QALY. The results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: When imatinib loses patent protection and its price declines, its 
use will be the cost-effective initial treatment strategy for CML-CP.
