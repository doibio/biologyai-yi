study using a validated instrument to define patient preference for an aspect of 
colorectal cancer treatment. The evidence suggests that patients are prepared to 
trade significant reductions in life expectancy to avoid certain complications 
of colorectal surgery, particularly stoma formation. In the adjuvant setting, 
patients are prepared to risk significant treatment side effects to gain small 
potential increases in life expectancy and chance of survival. Where neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant treatment risks worsening function, however, patients generally 
forgo any potential increase in survival to improve bowel function and therefore 
quality of life. The only predictors of preference were tertiary education and 
previous cancer treatment.
CONCLUSION: Most patients judge a moderate survival benefit to be sufficient to 
make adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer worthwhile, but they are willing to 
trade a potential reduction in life expectancy and survival to avoid certain 
unwanted surgical sequelae.

In C. elegans, mutations in the conserved insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway 
lead to a robust extension in lifespan, improved late life health, and 
protection from age-related disease. These effects are mediated by the FoxO 
transcription factor DAF-16 which lies downstream of the IIS kinase cascade. 
Identifying and functionally testing DAF-16 target genes has been a focal point 
of ageing research for the last 10 years. Here, I review the recent advances in 
identifying and understanding IIS/DAF-16 targets. These studies continue to 
reveal the intricate nature of the IIS/DAF-16 gene regulation network and are 
helping us to understand the mechanisms that control lifespan. Ageing and age 
related disease is an area of intense public interest, and the biochemical 
characterization of the genes involved will be critical for identifying drugs to 
improve the health of our ageing population.

Comparing and explaining differences in the magnitude, content, and sensitivity 
of utilities predicted by the EQ-5D, SF-6D, HUI 3, 15D, QWB, and AQoL-8D

MAK, AI, AM).

BACKGROUND: Cost utility analysis permits the comparison of disparate health 
services by measuring outcomes in comparable units, namely, quality-adjusted 
life-years, which equal life-years times the utility of the health state. 
However, comparability is compromised when different utility instruments predict 
different utilities for the same health state. The present paper measures the 
extent of, and reason for, differences between the utilities predicted by the 
EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI 3, 15D, QWB, and AQoL-8D.
METHODS: Data were obtained from patients in seven disease areas and members of 
the healthy public in six countries. Differences between public and patient 
utilities were estimated using each of the instruments. To explain discrepancies 
between the estimates, the measurement scales and content of the instruments 
were compared. The sensitivity of instruments to independently measured health 
dimensions was measured in pairwise comparisons of all combinations of the 
instruments.
RESULTS: The difference between public and patient utilities varied with the 
choice of instrument by more than 50% for every disease group and in four of the 
seven groups by more than 100%. Discrepancies were associated with differences 
in both the instrument content and their measurement scales. Pairwise 
comparisons of instruments found that variation in the sensitivity to physical 
and psychosocial dimensions of health closely reflected the items in the 
instrument's descriptive systems.
DISCUSSION: Results indicate that instruments measure related but different 
constructs. They imply that commonly used instruments systematically 
discriminate against some classes of services, most notably mental health 
services. Differences in the instrument scales imply the need for 
transformations between the instruments to increase the comparability of 
measurement.

The impact of gender-related pathophysiologic features of severe aortic stenosis 
on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) outcomes remains to be 
determined, as does the consistency of predictors of mortality between the 
genders. All consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at 6 institutions were 
enrolled in this study and stratified according to gender. Midterm all-cause 
mortality was the primary end point, with events at 30 days and at midterm as 
secondary end points. All events were adjudicated according to Valve Academic 
Research Consortium definitions. Eight hundred thirty-six patients were 
enrolled, 464 (55.5%) of whom were female. At midterm follow-up (median 365 
days, interquartile range 100 to 516) women had similar rates of all-cause 
mortality compared with men (18.1% vs 22.6%, p = 0.11) and similar incidence of 
myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident. Gender did not affect 
mortality also on multivariate analysis. Among clinical and procedural features, 
glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.36 to 4.79) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure 
>50 mm Hg (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.02) independently predicted mortality in 
women, while insulin-treated diabetes (HR 3.45, 95% CI 1.47 to 8.09), previous 
stroke (HR 3.42, 95% CI 1.43 to 8.18), and an ejection fraction <30% (HR 3.82, 
95% CI 1.41 to 10.37) were related to mortality in men. Postprocedural aortic 
regurgitation was independently related to midterm mortality in the 2 groups (HR 
11.19, 95% CI 3.3 to 37.9). In conclusion, women and men had the same life 
expectancy after TAVI, but different predictors of adverse events stratified by 
gender were demonstrated. These findings underline the importance of a 
gender-tailored clinical risk assessment in TAVI patients.

BACKGROUND: Most human demographic data, particularly those on natural fertility 
populations, find no relationship or even a positive association between 
fertility and longevity. The present study aims to ascertain whether there is a 
trade-off between fertility and longevity in the mouse model.
METHODS: The study was focused on the first litter produced by 10- to 14-wk-old 
hybrid (C57BL/6JIco female X CBA/JIco male) mice. A single female/male per 
litter was individually housed with a male/female at the age of 25 and 52 wk, 
respectively, until the end of reproductive life in females or natural death in 
males under controlled housing conditions. Post-reproductive females and virgin 
mice were reared until natural death. Cox regression models with forward 
stepwise variable selection were fitted to examine the effect of several 
fertility variables on expectation of survival times.
RESULTS: Virgin females displayed higher life expectancy than virgin males. The 
relative risk of dying for a virgin male at a particular age was 2.116 [99% 
confidence interval: 1.317, 3.398] times that of a virgin female. No significant 
differences on expectation of survival times between virgin and mated females, 
and between virgin and mated males were found. Furthermore, total number of pups 
at weaning and total number of litters produced by a dam/stud, time interval 
between mating and last litter, time interval between litters, and age at last 
litter were not significant predictors of expectation of survival times in both 
mated females and mated males.
CONCLUSIONS: Like in most human studies, the present study evidences no 
relationship between total number of offspring/litters produced by a dam/stud 
and expectation of survival times. Moreover, the present data are in agreement 
with the general phenomenon of a bias in life expectancy in favor of females.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture in the elderly is a serious problem, and solutions to 
prevent falls are needed.
OBJECTIVE: This study focused on elucidating data critical to fall prevention by 
evaluating ambulatory function, and we achieved this by developing a plantar 
pressure measurement device to determine gait function.
METHODS: Our device enables measurement of gait function in the unrestrained 
state by transmitting wireless data. In this study, we applied the device to 
field experiments involving 98 subjects (39 healthy individuals, 44 elderly 
non-fallers, and 15 elderly fallers). Gait features were determined by measuring 
the pressure values and foot contact patterns used as gait function parameters 
in previous studies.
RESULTS: In particular, decreased peak pressure values were noted at heel strike 
and toe off during walking in elderly fallers compared with elderly non-fallers. 
In addition, compared with healthy subjects, elderly fallers also showed 
extension of the double support phase, and differences in individual gait 
pattern features were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Experiments confirmed that our device can be used to obtain the 
gait features of a diverse group of elderly individuals. Moreover, our device 
enables objective and quantitative evaluation of gait function and thus may be 
useful for evaluating gait function in the elderly.

Custodian for elderly with memory impairment in Sweden - a study of 260 
physicians' statements to the court.

BACKGROUND: In the modern world with new family structures, international 
migration and increased life expectancy, there is a growing need for legal ways 
of assisting elderly with impaired mental capacity to decide about their life 
and assets. There are few studies about the physician's role when a court 
appoints proxies for vulnerable elderly. Many doctors do not know how to assess 
mental capacity, and most lawyers and judges know little about medicine.
METHODS: Applications for a custodian sent to the Stockholm Chief Guardian' 
Office in Sweden were used. Physician's statements to the court for elderly with 
memory impairment were selected and 260 statements were scrutinized with regard 
to formal quality, the narrative content and the physician who wrote it.
RESULTS: The quality of the statements varied from one sentence to excellent. 
Most statements were written by senior family practitioners or geriatricians. 
Seventeen % of the statements were handwritten and had more formal shortcomings 
than machine/computer written statements.The majority of patients needed massive 
help with daily life and economy. Median age was 84 years of age. MMSE score was 
given in 20% of the cases and varied from 6-27.A diagnosis of dementia was 
established in 57%. At the time of application, at least 48% were in a hospital 
or nursing home and at least 27% were in their private home. Only 5% were living 
with a spouse or a child. In 53% of the cases, the doctor knew the patient, but 
in 40% of the cases, the identity of the patient was not confirmed. The 
physician found that 54% were unable to understand the idea of getting a 
custodian, but out of those very vulnerable elderly, 20% had signed consent and 
57% were considered able to be heard in court.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a large variation in the quality of physicians' statements 
to the court concerning the mental capacity of elderly patients with cognitive 
impairment. Many statements have serious short-comings, and the system is not 
safe. There is a strong need for guide-lines, and additional training for all 
professionals involved.

The impact of living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is considerable and 
psychosocial support can be beneficial. Mindfulness-based stress reduction 
(MBSR) can help self-management of anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), 
and fatigue and has been evaluated in early-stage breast cancer but not MBC. 
This study investigated the acceptability and feasibility of providing MBSR for 
women with MBC and of introducing MBSR into a National Health Service (NHS) 
setting. A mixed methods convergent design was used. Eligible women with MBC, an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 2, stable disease, and 
life expectancy of at least 6 months were invited to attend (by their 
oncologist) an 8-week MBSR course. Qualitative interviews with patients, a focus 
group, and interview with NHS staff were held to explore acceptability and 
feasibility of MBSR. Questionnaires at baseline, during (weeks 4, 8), and after 
(weeks 16, 24) the course measured fatigue, anxiety and depression, mindfulness, 
disease-specific QoL, and generic preference based QoL. Of 100 women approached, 
20 joined the study. One woman dropped out prior to the intervention due to 
illness progression. Nineteen women took part in 3 MBSR courses. Recruitment to 
2 of the 3 courses was slow. Commitment to 8 weeks was a reason for 
non-participation, and proved challenging to participants during the course. 
Participants found the course acceptable and reported many cumulative and 
ongoing benefits. These included feeling less reactive to emotional distress and 
more accepting of the disruption to life that occurs with living with MBC. There 
was high attendance, completion of course sessions, adherence to home practice, 
excellent follow-up rates, and high questionnaire return rates. MBSR was 
acceptable to MBC patients, who perceived benefits such as improved anxiety and 
QoL; but the MBSR course requires a considerable time commitment. There is scope 
to tailor the intervention so that it is less intensive.

(1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University College Hospital, Ibadan, 
Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Suppurative extension of rhinosinusitis to the orbit is a 
complication that often results from delay in diagnosis and, or inadequate 
treatment. These complications may range from preseptal cellulitis, orbital 
cellulitis, orbital abscesses, and subperiosteal abscesses to intracranial 
extension with a threat to both vision and life. This study aims to review the 
clinical profile, treatment modalities and outcome of orbital complications of 
rhinosinusitis in Ibadan, Nigeria.
METHOD: A retrospective review of the charts of patients with orbital 
complications of rhinosinusitis managed in the departments of 
Otorhinolaryngology and Ophthalmology, University College Hospital, Ibadan over 
a five year period (Feb 2002- Jan 2007) was carried out .The diagnosis of 
rhinosinusitis was based on history, physical examination, plain x ray and CT 
scan findings and antral puncture. Demographic data, clinical presentation and 
treatment were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were reviewed in the study. There were 13males 
and 11females (M/F, 1:1). The age range was 8months to 75years, 14 (58.3%) 
patients were children and while 10 (41.7%) patients were adults. 75% of the 
patients were seen during the dry season (November to February). The duration of 
symptoms ranged from one day to three weeks. Involvement of one eye occurred in 
14 patients (58.3%); right eye (4), left eye (10). Both eyes were involved in 10 
patients (41.7%). Non-axial proptosis was seen in 8 patients (33.3%). It was 
infero-lateral in 6 patients (25%) and infero-nasal in two (8.3%) patients. 
Orbital cellulitis was seen in 10 (41.7%) patients, 6 (25%) patients had 
preseptal cellulitis while 8 (33%) patients had orbital abscess. Cavernous sinus 
thrombosis was seen in 3 (12.5%) patients. The cases with preseptal and orbital 
cellulitis were effectively managed by intravenous antibiotics. Orbital 
abscesses were drained surgically with complete resolution. Sinus surgical 
procedures were done in 10(41.7%) patients. This group of patients had 
preoperative visual acuity of between 6/6 and 6/60. They all had complete 
resolution of proptosis and good visual outcome.
CONCLUSION: Orbital complications of acute rhinosinusitis are common in 
children. Surgical drainage and aggressive medical management remain the 
standard to achieve a good prognosis and visual outcome.

STEWARDSHIP: A Conceptual Imperative For Managerial Effectiveness In The 
Nigerian Health System.

[No authors listed]

Unacceptable health status indicators such as high infant and maternal mortality 
rates and low life expectancy have continued unabated inspite of government 
efforts to change it. This paper espouses the concept of stewardship as a 
selfless, ethical, cost effective and outcome oriented approach to governance. 
It is believed that through stewardship approach governments would improve the 
health status of their populations considerably. The paper implores not only 
government and health care managers but the Nigerian society also to imbibe the 
concept of stewardship to make the development of a result-oriented health 
system easy.

Summary for patients in
    Am Fam Physician. 2014 Jun 15;89(12):Online.

Hip fractures cause significant morbidity and are associated with increased 
mortality. Women experience 80% of hip fractures, and the average age of persons 
who have a hip fracture is 80 years. Most hip fractures are associated with a 
fall, although other risk factors include decreased bone mineral density, 
reduced level of activity, and chronic medication use. Patients with hip 
fractures have pain in the groin and are unable to bear weight on the affected 
extremity. During the physical examination, displaced fractures present with 
external rotation and abduction, and the leg will appear shortened. Plain 
radiography with cross-table lateral view of the hip and anteroposterior view of 
the pelvis usually confirms the diagnosis. If an occult hip fracture is 
suspected and plain radiography is normal, magnetic resonance imaging should be 
ordered. Most fractures are treated surgically unless the patient has 
significant comorbidities or reduced life expectancy. The consulting orthopedic 
surgeon will choose the surgical procedure. Patients should receive prophylactic 
antibiotics, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, before surgery. In 
addition, patients should receive thromboembolic prophylaxis, preferably with 
low-molecular-weight heparin. Rehabilitation is critical to long-term recovery. 
Unless contraindicated, bisphosphonate therapy should be used to reduce the risk 
of another hip fracture. Some patients may benefit from a fall-prevention 
assessment.

Characteristics of the ichthyofauna of a temperate microtidal estuary with a 
reverse salinity gradient, including inter-decadal comparisons.

Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.

Data on the fish fauna of the Leschenault Estuary on the lower west coast of 
Australia were collected and used as a model to elucidate the characteristics of 
permanently open estuaries with a reverse salinity gradient, which undergo 
seasonal changes similar to many other estuaries with Mediterranean climate. 
Focus was placed on determining (1) the relationships of the number of species, 
density, life cycle category and species composition of fishes with region 
(within estuary), season and year and salinity, (2) whether species are 
partitioned along the lengths of such systems and (3) the extent and 
significance of any inter-decadal changes in species composition. The analyses 
and interpretation involved using multi-factorial permutational multivariate 
analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) designs, 
and three new or recently published visualization tools, i.e. modified 
non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plots, coherent species curves and 
segmented bubble plots. The base, lower, upper and apex regions of the 
Leschenault Estuary, along which the salinity increased in each season except in 
winter when most rainfall occurs, were sampled seasonally for the 2 years 
between winter 2008 and autumn 2010. Estuarine residents contributed twice as 
many individuals, but less than half the number of species as marine taxa. While 
the numbers of marine species and estuarine residents declined between the base 
or lower and apex regions, the individuals of marine species dominated the 
catches in the base region and estuarine residents in the other three regions. 
Ichthyofaunal composition in each region underwent conspicuous annual cyclical 
changes, due to time-staggered differences in recruitment among species, and 
changed sequentially along the estuary, both paralleling salinity trends. 
Different groups of species characterized the fauna in the different regions and 
seasons, thereby partitioning resources among species. The ichthyofauna of the 
apex region, in which salinities reached 54 and temperatures 36° C, recorded the 
highest maximum density and, in terms of abundance, was dominated (90%) by three 
atherinid species, emphasizing the ability of this family to tolerate extreme 
conditions. Comparisons between the data for 2008-2010 and 1994 demonstrate that 
the spotted hardyhead Craterocephalus mugiloides and the common hardyhead 
Atherinomorus vaigiensis had colonized and become abundant in the Leschenault 
Estuary in the intervening period. This represents a southwards extension of the 
distribution of these essentially tropical species during a period of increasing 
coastal water temperatures as a result of climate change. The abundance of 
weed-associated species, e.g. the western gobbleguts Ostorhinchus rueppellii and 
the soldier Gymnapistes marmoratus, increased, whereas that of the longfinned 
goby Favonigobius lateralis decreased, probably reflecting increases in 
eutrophication and siltation, respectively.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Evidence indicates that vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) 
and oral anticoagulant therapy are under-utilised for stroke prevention in 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), and patients who decline or 
cannot tolerate such treatment are often prescribed aspirin instead. Apixaban 
has been shown in the AVERROES trial to be superior to aspirin in preventing 
stroke and systemic embolism without significantly increasing the risk of major 
bleeding among patients with AF who are unsuitable for VKA therapy. This study 
estimates the economic implications and potential cost effectiveness of apixaban 
compared with aspirin in such individuals from the perspective of healthcare 
payers in Belgium.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the clinical and economic 
impact of apixaban compared with aspirin in patients unsuitable for VKA therapy. 
The clinical events modelled include ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, systemic 
embolism, intracranial haemorrhage, other major bleeding, clinically relevant 
non-major bleeding, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular hospitalisation and 
treatment discontinuations obtained from AVERROES. Outcomes included life-years 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a lifetime.
RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy and QALYs compared 
with aspirin, with an associated increase in drug acquisition costs. The 
estimated ICER was <euro>7,334 per QALY gained with apixaban compared with 
aspirin.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is a cost-effective alternative to aspirin for patients 
with AF in Belgium who decline or cannot tolerate VKA treatment.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic options for the management of 
glioblastoma (GBM) have greatly evolved over the last decade with the emergence 
of new regimens combining radiotherapy plus temozolomide and the use of 
bevacizumab at recurrence. Our aim was to assess the clinical and economic 
impacts of those novel strategies in our center.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review was conducted on patients 
newly diagnosed with a GBM over two periods (year 2004, group 1 or year 2008, 
group 2) with limitations to those eligible to radiotherapy after initial 
diagnosis. The type of medical management was described and compared, as well as 
overall survival and total costs from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up 
date. Cost analysis was performed under the French Sickness Fund perspective 
using tariffs from 2012.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients were selected (49 in group 1 and 73 in 
group 2) with similar baseline characteristics within the two groups. Patients 
from group 2 received more frequently temozolomide radiochemotherapy (71% vs. 
39%, P < 0·05) as first-line treatment as well as bevacizumab regimen at 
recurrence (48% vs. 6%, P < 0·05); the median overall survival was increased 
between the two periods (respectively 17 vs. 10 months, P < 0·05). The mean 
total cost per patient was 54,388 € in group 1 and 71,148 € in group 2 (P < 
0·05). Hospital care represented the largest expenditure (76% and 58% in groups 
1 and 2 respectively) followed by chemotherapy drugs costs (11% and 30% 
respectively). The total cost difference between the two groups was explained by 
the increasing use of temozolomide and bevacizumab. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at 54,355 € per life-year gained.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: As far as we know, this is the first study reporting 
the total cost of GBM management based on the French perspective, as well as the 
cost-effectiveness of clinical practices in term of cost per life-year gained. 
Those novel strategies have contributed to improve overall survival while 
inducing a substantial, but acceptable, increase of total costs.

Erratum in
    BMJ Open. 2014;4(9):e005332corr1.

OBJECTIVES: To compare healthcare costs and mortality rates of Dutch patients 
with a conventional (CON) general practitioner (GP) and patients with a GP who 
has additionally completed training in complementary and alternative medicine 
(CAM).
DESIGN: Comparative economic evaluation.
SETTING: Database from the Dutch insurance company Agis.
PARTICIPANTS: 1,521,773 patients (98.8%) from a CON practice and 18,862 patients 
(1.2%) from a CAM practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual information on five types of healthcare costs for 
the years 2006-2011: care by GP, hospital care, pharmaceutical care, paramedic 
care and care covered by supplementary insurance. Healthcare costs in the last 
year of life. Mortality rates.
RESULTS: The mean annual compulsory and supplementary healthcare costs of CON 
patients are respectively €1821 (95% CI 1813 to 1828) and €75.3 (95% CI 75.1 to 
75.5). Compulsory healthcare costs of CAM patients are €225 (95% CI 169 to 281; 
p<0.001; 12.4%) lower and result mainly from lower hospital care costs (€165; 
95% CI 118 to 212; p<0.001) and lower pharmaceutical care costs (€58; 95% CI 41 
to 75; p<0.001), especially in the age categories 25-49 and 50-74 years. The 
costs in the last year of life of patients with CAM, GPs are €1161 (95% CI -138 
to 2461; p<0.1) lower. This difference is entirely due to lower hospital costs 
(€1250; 95% CI 19 to 2481; p<0.05). The mean annual supplementary costs of CAM 
patients are €33 (95% CI 30 to 37; p<0.001; 44%) higher. CAM patients do not 
have lower or higher mortality rates than CON patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Dutch patients whose GP additionally completed training in CAM on 
average have €192 (10.1%) lower annual total compulsory and supplementary 
healthcare costs and do not live longer or shorter than CON patients.

Emergency ambulance service involvement with residential care homes in the 
support of older people with dementia: an observational study.

Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL109AB, UK. c.goodman@herts.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: Older people resident in care homes have a limited life expectancy 
and approximately two-thirds have limited mental capacity. Despite initiatives 
to reduce unplanned hospital admissions for this population, little is known 
about the involvement of emergency services in supporting residents in these 
settings.
METHODS: This paper reports on a longitudinal study that tracked the involvement 
of emergency ambulance personnel in the support of older people with dementia, 
resident in care homes with no on-site nursing providing personal care only. 133 
residents with dementia across 6 care homes in the East of England were tracked 
for a year. The paper examines the frequency and reasons for emergency ambulance 
call-outs, outcomes and factors associated with emergency ambulance service use.
RESULTS: 56% of residents used ambulance services. Less than half (43%) of all 
call-outs resulted in an unscheduled admission to hospital. In addition to 
trauma following a following a fall in the home, results suggest that at least a 
reasonable proportion of ambulance contacts are for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions. An emergency ambulance is not likely to be called for older rather 
than younger residents or for women more than men. Length of residence does not 
influence use of emergency ambulance services among older people with dementia. 
Contact with primary care services and admission route into the care home were 
both significantly associated with emergency ambulance service use. The odds of 
using emergency ambulance services for residents admitted from a relative's home 
were 90% lower than the odds of using emergency ambulance services for residents 
admitted from their own home.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency service involvement with this vulnerable population 
merits further examination. Future research on emergency ambulance service use 
by older people with dementia in care homes, should account for important 
contextual factors, namely, presence or absence of on-site nursing, GP 
involvement, and access to residents' family, alongside resident health 
characteristics.

Qualitative study exploring healthy eating practices and physical activity among 
adolescent girls in rural South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Dietary behaviours and physical activity are modifiable risk factors 
to address increasing levels of obesity among children and adolescents, and 
consequently to reduce later cardiovascular and metabolic disease. This paper 
explores perceptions, attitudes, barriers, and facilitators related to healthy 
eating and physical activity among adolescent girls in rural South Africa.
METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in the rural Agincourt subdistrict, 
covered by a health and sociodemographic surveillance system, in Mpumalanga 
province, South Africa. Semistructured "duo-interviews" were carried out with 11 
pairs of adolescent female friends aged 16 to 19 years. Thematic content 
analysis was used.
RESULTS: The majority of participants considered locally grown and traditional 
foods, especially fruits and vegetables, to be healthy. Their consumption was 
limited by availability, and these foods were often sourced from family or 
neighbourhood gardens. Female caregivers and school meal programmes facilitated 
healthy eating practices. Most participants believed in the importance of 
breakfast, even though for the majority, limited food within the household was a 
barrier to eating breakfast before going to school. The majority cited limited 
accessibility as a major barrier to healthy eating, and noted the increasing 
intake of "convenient and less healthy foods". Girls were aware of the benefits 
of physical activity and engaged in various physical activities within the home, 
community, and schools, including household chores, walking long distances to 
school, traditional dancing, and extramural activities such as netball and 
soccer.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show widespread knowledge about healthy eating and the 
benefits of consuming locally grown and traditional food items in a population 
that is undergoing nutrition transition. Limited access and food availability 
are strong barriers to healthy eating practices. School meal programmes are an 
important facilitator of healthy eating, and breakfast provision should be 
considered as an extension of the meal programme. Walking to school, cultural 
dance, and extramural activities can be encouraged and thus are useful 
facilitators for increasing physical activity among rural adolescent girls, 
where the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing.

To sustain natural systems, there must be an ongoing balance between 
environmental, social, and economic considerations. A key element of 
sustainability theory is to identify the most vulnerable surroundings. The most 
vulnerable knee tissue is the articular cartilage as it is the last line of 
osteoarthritis (OA) defense. This tissue has a poor capacity for healing. Based 
on sustainability theory and social ecology concepts we propose that several key 
factors contribute to knee function preservation. Factors include health 
history, genetic predisposition, personal behaviors, and socio-environmental 
factors in addition to local-regional-global physiological system function. 
Addressing only some of these factors or any one factor in isolation may lead to 
less than optimal treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this commentary is to 
introduce a medical, surgical and rehabilitation management approach for 
patients with knee OA that considers more than physical function improvement. 
This approach also considers social, emotional, and environmental factors to 
better ensure patient satisfaction, fulfilled expectations and successful 
outcomes. A clinical care pathway is presented for a 57-year-old patient with 
medial compartment knee OA who is contemplating early arthroplasty versus a knee 
function preservation treatment approach. Early arthroplasty refers to high 
revision likelihood based on a minimum 15 year prosthesis life-expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness, safety and costs of standard versus 
individually tailored reduced doses of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs 
in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) after achieving low-disease 
activity.
METHODS: This was a single-centre prospective observational study performed 
within the ATTRA registry. The anti-TNF dose tapering strategy was chosen by 
treating physicians, without prespecified protocol. We used propensity score 
(PS) methodology to identify two cohorts of patients matched for relevant 
baseline characteristics who were treated with either reduced (n=53) or standard 
(n=83) doses of TNF inhibitors. One-year outcomes and costs of anti-TNF drugs 
were compared between both PS-matched cohorts.
RESULTS: In the reduced dosing group, the median dose of TNF inhibitor 
corresponded to 0.67 and 0.5 of the standard dose initially and at 12 months 
respectively, and 21% of patients required return to standard dosing regimen. 
The mean change per year in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Index, 
C-reactive protein , Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and Bath 
AS functional index, as well as quality-adjusted life-year area under the curve 
were no different between both groups. The HR (95% CI) of reduced versus 
standard dosing group for relapse and any adverse event was 1.46 (0.66 to 3.19) 
and 0.56 (0.22 to 1.44), respectively. Mean difference (95% CI) in cost of 
anti-TNF drugs was €-4214 (-4707 to -3701) per year of treatment in favour of 
reduced dosing strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AS after reaching low-disease activity, a tailored 
approach to reduce doses of anti-TNF drugs produced similar clinical outcomes at 
1 year, but was substantially less costly.

Interest in technology for older adults is driven by multiple converging trends: 
the rapid pace of technological development; the unprecedented growth of the 
aging population in the United States and worldwide; the increase in the number 
and survival of persons with disability; the growing and unsustainable costs of 
caring for the elderly people; and the increasing interest on the part of 
business, industry, and government agencies in addressing health care needs with 
technology. These trends have contributed to the strong conviction that 
technology can play an important role in enhancing quality of life and 
independence of older individuals with high levels of efficiency, potentially 
reducing individual and societal costs of caring for the elderly people. The 
purpose of this "Forum" position article is to integrate what we know about 
older adults and technology systems in order to provide direction to this vital 
enterprise. We define what we mean by technology for an aging population, 
provide a brief history of its development, introduce a taxonomy for 
characterizing current technology applications to older adults, summarize 
research in this area, describe existing development and evaluation processes, 
identify factors important for the acceptance of technology among older 
individuals, and recommend future directions for research in this area.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an autosomal recessive 
disease characterized by the deposition of phosphate and calcium in the alveoli. 
The disease progresses asymptomatically until later stages. When it becomes 
symptomatic, lung transplantations performed before the onset of right heart 
failure may improve life expectancy and quality. Here we present a case report 
concerning the very first Turkish PAM patient to have undergone lung 
transplantation surgery. Patient information: A 52 year-old female, Caucasian 
patient, already diagnosed with PAM in infancy, was admitted to the intensive 
care unit, diagnosed with pneumonia and hospitalized for 20 days. We decided to 
refer the patient to a specialized center for lung transplantation. Bilateral 
lung transplantation was performed in Vienna 14 months later and no recurrence 
was observed during the first postoperative year.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral lung transplantation may improve both the life expectancy 
and the quality of life of PAM diagnosed patients with severe respiratory 
failure who do not suffer from right heart failure. The risk of recurrence 
should not be considered as a justifying reason to avoid transplantation as a 
treatment method.

Oral antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C infection.

The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with pegylated interferon 
alpha and ribavirin leads to a sustained virologic response in around 50% of 
patients with HCV genotype 1, 65% with HCV genotype 4, 75% with HCV genotype 3 
and around 80% with HCV genotype 2. A better understanding of the HCV lifecycle 
has resulted in the development of several potential direct-acting antiviral 
drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins [NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5B 
nucleos(t)idic and non-nucleos(t)idic polymerase inhibitors, NS5A replication 
complex inhibitors]. This review summarizes the main clinical data for the 
combinations of oral DAAs. DAAs, either in combination with pegylated interferon 
alpha or in interferon-free regimens, have demonstrated a high level of 
antiviral efficacy and a generally well-tolerated safety profile in 
treatment-naïve patients and in prior nonresponders to pegylated interferon 
alpha/ribavirin. Oral combination of new DAAs is likely to become the standard 
of care for chronic HCV in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients. 
However, most studies so far have included small numbers of 'easy-to-treat' 
patients with short post-treatment periods for defining the sustained virologic 
response. Extension of the number of treated patients (including 
'difficult-to-treat' patients, i.e. patients infected with genotype 3, who 
failed to respond to first-generation protease inhibitors or with cirrhosis as 
well as immunocompromised patients) and of the post-treatment follow up in a 
real-life setting could significantly worsen the rate of recovery. In these 
'difficult-to-treat' patients, the rate of virologic cure with new DAAs could be 
lower than expected and consequently interferons may be still necessary in 
combination with the new drugs.
