The potential gain in life expectancy which could result from the complete 
elimination of mortality from cancer in the U.S. would not exceed 3 years if one 
were to consider cancer independently of other causes of death. In this paper, 
we review evidence of trade-offs between cancer and aging as well as between 
cancer and other diseases, which, if taken into account, may substantially 
increase estimates of gain in life expectancy resulting from cancer eradication. 
We also used the Multiple Causes of Death (MCD) data to evaluate correlations 
among mortalities from cancer and other major disorders including heart disease, 
stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, and asthma. Our analyses 
revealed significant negative correlations between cancer and other diseases 
suggesting stronger population effects of cancer eradication. Possible 
mechanisms of the observed dependencies and emerging perspectives of using 
dependent competing risks models for evaluating the effects of reduction of 
mortality from cancer on life expectancy are discussed.

Even though cohabitation has become more prevalent in the last few decades, the 
majority of the adult population is married, and marriage is associated with a 
number of factors, such as educational outcom and health. Understanding the 
marrie population is also an important part of understanding partnering 
behaviour and family formation and dissolution. The length of marriages and 
whether they are ended by death or divorce is therefore of interest t

Breast cancer is a potentially deadly disease affecting one in eight women. With 
the trend toward minimally invasive therapies for breast cancer, such as breast 
conserving therapies, sentinel node biopsies, and early treatments of radiation 
and chemotherapy, life expectancy after breast cancer has increased. However, 
pain after breast cancer surgery is a major problem and women undergoing 
mastectomy and breast reconstruction experience postoperative pain syndromes in 
approximately one-half of all cases. Patients post mastectomy and breast 
reconstruction can suffer from acute nociceptive pain and chronic neuropathic 
pain syndromes. Several preventative measures to control acute post operative 
pain and chronic pain states such as post mastectomy pain and phantom pain have 
been tried. This review focuses on the recent research done to control acute and 
chronic pain in patients receiving minimally invasive therapies for breast 
cancer, such as breast conserving therapies of mastectomies and breast 
reconstruction, sentinel node biopsies, and early treatments of radiation and 
chemotherapy.

Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. sramsey@fhcrc.org

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is a costly procedure that can improve 
quality and quantity of life. Given the prevalence of emphysema, the costs 
involved with its management, and resource constraints on all health care 
delivery systems, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of LVRS is important. In 
this article, we describe the purposes and principles of cost-effectiveness 
analysis and how those principles were applied in evaluating LVRS. We present 
the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis that was conducted alongside the 
National Emphysema Treatment Trial and other economic studies of LVRS and 
discuss how these should be interpreted in the context of current reimbursement 
guidelines.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has markedly prolonged life 
expectancy in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Use 
of HAART has been associated with development of a metabolic syndrome that may 
increase the risk of developing ischemic heart disease. The purpose of this 
review is to discuss the incidence and clinical manifestations of the metabolic 
syndrome in patients with HIV infection and contributing factors, as well as 
whether cardiovascular risk is disproportionately elevated in patients with 
HIV-associated metabolic syndrome.

[The long term results and survival prognostic factors of surgical treatment 
ampulla Vateri cancer].

[Article in Russian]

Alibegov RA, Prokhorenko TI, Sergeev OA, Khlusov AN.

Results of radical operative treatment of 21 patients with ampulla Vateri cancer 
are presented. Within the first 30 days after pancreaticoduodenal resection 2 
(9.5%) patients have died. The long-term results were studied at 19 (90.4%) 
patients. The one-year, the three-year and five-year survival percentage was 
89.4, 57.8 and 36.8% accordingly. The median of life expectancy is equal to 44 
months. Factors having prognostic value for survival rate are the stage of 
disease, metastatic regional spread, tumor invasion in a head of a pancreas, 
microscopic picture of a pancreatitis in a phase of acute condition. However, 
the only independent factor of the prognosis for a disease is the stage of 
neoplastic process.

Obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a 
public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and 
metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Owing to the increase in obesity, 
life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time 
in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not 
fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells 
(adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number 
is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat 
cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after 
marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during 
childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable 
population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by 
analysing the integration of 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA. 
Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels 
of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in 
early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this 
condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new 
therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.

Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. pessinh@mskcc.org

BACKGROUND: The impact of psychosocial research participation has not been 
examined systematically in palliative care settings. Concerns are often raised 
regarding the potential for distress among terminally ill patients. This is 
particularly true when death and dying are the focus of research. Therefore, it 
is important to understand the specific ways psychosocial research could 
potentially harm or be helpful to participants.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden and benefits of participation in psychosocial 
research addressing end-of-life issues among patients receiving inpatient 
palliative care.
DESIGN: Sixty-eight terminally ill patients with cancer who had an average life 
expectancy of less than 2 months, were administered a brief self-report 
questionnaire to assess whether participation in psychosocial research was 
burdensome and/or beneficial. The specific factors that contributed to their 
perceptions were also identified.
RESULTS: The majority of patients reported no burden associated with 
participation (75%) and found the experience as moderately to highly beneficial 
(68%). Factors most frequently identified as burdensome included the length of 
the interview (21%), structure of the questionnaires (18%), and difficulty 
discussing end-of life issues (12%). Although some patients reported some 
distress while discussing end-of-life issues (19%), few endorsed a high level of 
distress (6%). Factors most frequently identified as beneficial were the social 
interaction (75%), sense of contributing to society (57%), and the opportunity 
to discuss their illness (47%).
CONCLUSIONS: Participants in psychosocial end-of-life research are unlikely to 
experience significant burden from participation and, in fact, may benefit.

Risk attitudes to treatment among patients with severe intermittent 
claudication.

Letterstål A(1), Forsberg C, Olofsson P, Wahlberg E.

Author information:
(1)Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, 
Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: To determine claudication patients' risk attitude to invasive 
treatment and whether this treatment is cost effective.
METHODS: Quality of life and health state utility status of 50 consecutive 
patients with severe intermittent claudication was assessed and compared with 
ankle-brachial pressure index values (ABPI) and results from treadmill tests 
before and after endovascular or open revascularization. Health utility scores 
were then calculated and used in a cost-utility analysis.
RESULTS: Before surgery, patients were assigned a utility score of 0.51 (EQ-5D 
index) for their disease, and the standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO) 
median scores were 0.88 and 0.70, respectively. Before treatment, a weak 
correlation (r = 0.43, P < .001) between having a high risk perception of 
treatment and patients' walking distance were observed, where patients able to 
walk short distances accepted a higher risk. After treatment, ABI (P = .003) and 
walking distance (P = .002) improved significantly as well the physical 
components of the quality of life instruments (P < .001). The surgical treatment 
generated an improvement in quality of life expressed in QALYs equivalent to 
0.17. With an estimated survival of 5 years, it adds up to a value of 0.85, 
corresponding to a sum of 51,000 US dollars gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe intermittent claudication are risk-seeking 
when it comes to surgical treatment and their risk attitude is correlated to 
their walking ability and quality of life. The incremental QALYs gained by 
treatment are achieved at a reasonable cost and revascularization appears to be 
cost effective.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of 
presumed autoimmune etiology affecting predominantly middle-aged women; it is a 
slowly progressive disease causing loss of intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in 
advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Many drugs have been studied 
for treatment, including agents with choleretic and immunosuppressive 
properties. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been evaluated most widely. After 
liver failure, the only effective treatment is liver transplantation. Effective 
therapy reduces the need for transplantation and improves life expectancy. For 
advanced liver disease or incomplete response to UDCA, new therapies to cure or 
retard the progression of disease in PBC are needed.

Cuba's exclusively public health system has been quite unique in pairing limited 
resources with excellent results. It continued to perform well during the 
economic crisis of the 1990s, and now that the hardships are being overcome, new 
opportunities are developing-as well as threats: (1) economic recovery should 
permit reinforcing of the system's effectiveness; (2) Cuba's increasing 
international solidarity in health also poses it corresponding challenges at 
home; (3) the ageing of the population necessitates adjustments to the health 
care system. However, the original principles of the health care system are not 
under question. Cuba can be considered a unique laboratory, and deserves more 
attention from the international public health community.

OBJECTIVES: Because of a lack of Aboriginal identifiers on death registrations, 
standard data sources and methods cannot be used to estimate basic health 
indicators for Inuit in Canada. Instead, a geographic-based approach was used to 
estimate life expectancy for the entire population of Inuit-inhabited areas.
DATA SOURCES: The data are from the Canadian Mortality Database and the Census 
of Canada.
ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Areas where at least 33% of residents were Inuit were 
identified, based on census results. Vital statistics death records for 1989 
through 2003 and census population counts for 1991, 1996 and 2001 were used to 
compute abridged life tables for the Inuit-inhabited areas in each of the three 
5-year periods centered around those census years.
MAIN RESULTS: In 1991, life expectancy at birth in the Inuit-inhabited areas was 
about 68 years, which was 10 years lower than for Canada overall. From 1991 to 
2001, life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas did not increase, although it 
rose by about two years for Canada as a whole. As a result, the gap widened to 
more than 12 years. Life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas was generally 
highest in the Inuvialuit region (Northwest Territories) and Nunavut 
(Territory), followed by Nunatsiavut (Labrador) and Nunavik (Quebec). While 
these results are not specific to the Inuit population, such geographic-based 
methods can be used with any administrative datasets that include postal codes 
or municipal-level locality codes.

Renal disease in patients with HIV infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and 
management.

Baltimore, Maryland, USA. dfine1@jhmi.edu

With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, we have witnessed 
prolonged survival with the potential for normal life expectancy in HIV-infected 
individuals. With improved survival and increasing age, HIV-infected patients 
are increasingly likely to experience co-morbidities that affect the general 
population, including kidney disease. Although HIV-associated nephropathy, the 
most ominous kidney disease related to the direct effects of HIV, may be 
prevented and treated with antiretrovirals, kidney disease remains an important 
issue in this population. In addition to the common risk factors for kidney 
disease of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, HIV-infected individuals have a 
high prevalence of other risk factors, including hepatitis C, cigarette smoking 
and injection drug use. Furthermore, they have exposures unique to this 
population, including antiretrovirals and other medications. Therefore, the 
differential diagnosis is vast. Early identification (through efficient 
screening) and definitive diagnosis (by kidney biopsy when indicated) of kidney 
disease in HIV-infected individuals are critical to optimal management. Earlier 
interventions with disease-specific therapy, often with the help of a 
nephrologist, are likely to lead to better outcomes. In those with chronic 
kidney disease, interventions, such as aggressive blood pressure control with 
the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists where tolerated, 
tight blood glucose control in those with diabetes, and avoidance of potentially 
nephrotoxic medications, can slow progression and prevent end-stage renal 
disease. Only with greater awareness of kidney-disease manifestations and their 
implications in this particularly vulnerable population will we be able to 
achieve success in confronting this growing problem.

Age- and calorie-independent life span extension from dietary restriction by 
bacterial deprivation in Caenorhabditis elegans.

BACKGROUND: Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span and delays 
age-associated disease in many organisms. The mechanism by which DR enhances 
longevity is not well understood.
RESULTS: Using bacterial food deprivation as a means of DR in C. elegans, we 
show that transient DR confers long-term benefits including stress resistance 
and increased longevity. Consistent with studies in the fruit fly and in mice, 
we demonstrate that DR also enhances survival when initiated late in life. DR by 
bacterial food deprivation significantly increases life span in worms when 
initiated as late as 24 days of adulthood, an age at which greater than 50% of 
the cohort have died. These survival benefits are, at least partially, 
independent of food consumption, as control fed animals are no longer consuming 
bacterial food at this advanced age. Animals separated from the bacterial lawn 
by a barrier of solid agar have a life span intermediate between control fed and 
food restricted animals. Thus, we find that life span extension from bacterial 
deprivation can be partially suppressed by a diffusible component of the 
bacterial food source, suggesting a calorie-independent mechanism for life span 
extension by dietary restriction.
CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we propose that dietary restriction by 
bacterial deprivation increases longevity in C. elegans by a combination of 
reduced food consumption and decreased food sensing.

(1)Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, 
USA. jsd13@cornell.edu

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the New York State Expanded Food and Nutrition Education 
Program using economic methodology.
DESIGN: Data were collected by nutrition educators in a pretest, posttest design 
with an epidemiological modeling approach to assess costs and estimate potential 
health benefits of the state program.
SETTING: Cooperative Extension, 35 counties.
PARTICIPANTS: 5730 low-income participants.
INTERVENTION: Series of 6 or more food and nutrition lessons.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost (program and participant); health benefits in 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and monetized benefits: society's 
willingness to pay for QALYs, and benefits of avoiding or delaying health care 
costs and loss of productivity.
ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness estimated from behavior change and QALY weights. 
Cost-benefit ratios estimated from costs and monetized benefits. Sensitivity 
analyses provided ranges where lack of agreement exists around parameters' 
values.
RESULTS: Cost was $892/graduate. Cost-effectiveness was 245 QALYs saved, at 
$20863/QALY (sensitivity 42-935 QALYs, $5467-$130311 per QALY). Societal 
willingness to pay benefit-to-cost ratio was $9.58:$1.00 (sensitivity 
$1.44-$41.92:$1:00); narrow governmental benefit-to-cost ratio was $0.82:$1.00 
(sensitivity $0.08-$4.33:$1:00).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Outcome data indicate that food and nutrition 
behavior changes resulting from the Program are likely to improve future health 
and reduce health care costs. Cost-effectiveness is estimated to be as great as 
for many current health interventions.

Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK.

In recent years, lipidomics or lipid profiling, an extension of metabolomics 
where the lipid complement of a cell, tissue or organism is measured, has been 
the recipient of increasing attention as a research tool in a range of diverse 
disciplines including physiology, lipid biochemistry, clinical biomarker 
discovery and pathology. The advancement of the field has been driven by the 
development of analytical technologies, and in particular advances in liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry and chemometric methods. In this review, we 
give an overview of the current methods with which lipid profiling is being 
performed. The benefits and shortcomings of mass spectrometry both in the 
presence and absence of chromatographic separation techniques such as liquid-, 
gas- and thin layer chromatography are explored. Alone these techniques have 
their limitations but through a combination many of the disadvantages may be 
overcome providing a valuable analytical tool for a variety of disease 
processes.

Treatment options for anemia, taking risks into consideration: 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents versus transfusions.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are indicated for the treatment of 
chemotherapy induced-anemia in cancer patients. Controlled clinical studies have 
shown that epoetin alfa consistently and significantly increases levels of 
hemoglobin (Hb), decreases the need for RBC transfusion, and improves the 
quality of life that is of such importance in cancer patients with a limited 
life expectancy. The rise achieved in Hb level correlates with an improvement in 
quality of life. Studies have also demonstrated that earlier initiation of 
epoetin therapy (i.e., starting treatment at an Hb level of 10-11 g/dl rather 
than waiting for Hb to fall to <10 g/dl) is associated with a faster achievement 
of an optimal Hb level, a lower transfusion requirement, and a maintained 
quality of life.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of percutaneous 
radiofrequency (RF) ablation versus nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) in patients 
with small (<or=4-cm) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), given a commonly accepted 
level of societal willingness to pay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to 
estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for 65-year-old patients with a 
small RCC treated with RF ablation or NSS. The model incorporated RCC presence, 
treatment effectiveness and costs, and short- and long-term outcomes. An 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify treatment 
preference under an assumed $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
societal willingness-to-pay threshold level, within proposed ranges for guiding 
implementation of new health care interventions. The effect of changes in key 
parameters on strategy preference was addressed in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: By using base-case assumptions, NSS yielded a minimally greater average 
quality-adjusted life expectancy than did RF ablation (2.5 days) but was more 
expensive. NSS had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,152,529 per 
QALY relative to RF ablation, greatly exceeding $75,000 per QALY. Therefore, RF 
ablation was considered preferred and remained so if the annual probability of 
post-RF ablation local recurrence was up to 48% higher relative to that 
post-NSS. NSS preference required an estimated NSS cost reduction of $7500 or RF 
ablation cost increase of $6229. Results were robust to changes in most model 
parameters, but treatment preference was dependent on the relative probabilities 
of local recurrence after RF ablation and NSS, the short-term costs of both, and 
quality of life after NSS.
CONCLUSION: RF ablation was preferred over NSS for small RCC treatment at a 
societal willingness-to-pay threshold level of $75,000 per QALY. This result was 
robust to changes in most model parameters, but somewhat dependent on the 
relative probabilities of post-RF ablation and post-NSS local recurrence, NSS 
and RF ablation short-term costs, and post-NSS quality of life, factors which 
merit further primary investigation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to address the important question of the 
increasing life expectancy and the aging population in the healthcare system 
today. We try to give some elements that will help the reflection about the 
ethical stakes balancing the necessity of care in the increasing number of 
elderly patients and the limited resources available, in the special context of 
acute care.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is growing evidence that the chronological age itself is 
not a reliable marker of bad prognosis or of mortality. The new concept of 
frailty may better correlate with the aging process of the elderly. The frailty 
index is an integrative approach considering the multiple factors impacting on 
the aging individual. Applied in the practical arena, it might become a useful 
tool for clinicians.
SUMMARY: Aging implies many biological modifications at molecular, cellular, 
organic levels as well as of the behavior. Some aspects of these processes and 
their consequences on health are described. The frailty concept is detailed, and 
its potential interest explained. We conclude that the measurement of aging 
phenomenon, including the frailty index, may help us to better assess the true 
health and the required therapeutics of elderly patients.

Do quality-adjusted life years take account of lost income? Evidence from an 
Australian survey.

The procedures used in cost utility analysis for eliciting quality of life 
weights have generally omitted any instruction concerning the level of 
consumption in a health state, despite the fact that some health states preclude 
the possibility of normal employment. This introduces ambiguity into the 
interpretation of quality of life (QoL) scores, and project ranking is sensitive 
to the subsequent treatment of consumption in the analysis. This article reports 
the results of a study that questioned 131 respondents to a time trade-off (TTO) 
interview about their assumptions concerning consumption and the amount of 
thought given to consumption. Results indicate that, without prompting, most 
assumed unchanged consumption, implying little bias in existing studies.

Microbiology, Ioannina 45110, Greece.

The present study evaluated the effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP, 5% 
O(2)/50% CO(2)/45% N(2); treatment M), the addition of oregano oil (0.1%, v/w; 
treatment AO) as a natural preservative, as well as their combination (treatment 
MO) on the quality and shelf life extension of fresh Mediterranean swordfish 
fillets during a refrigerated storage (4 degrees C) period of 18 d. 
Simultaneously, swordfish fillets were stored under aerobic conditions (control 
treatment A, 4 degrees C) and on ice (usual commercial method of preservation, 
treatment I, 0 degrees C). Among the 5 treatments examined in the present study, 
the most effective one to inhibit the microbial and sensory spoilage proved to 
be the MO treatment, achieving a shelf life extension of 8 to 9 d. The dominant 
bacteria in the microflora of swordfish, irrespective of treatment, were the 
Pseudomonads and the H(2)S-producing bacteria, while both lactic acid bacteria 
(LAB) and the Enterobacteriaceae produced the lowest populations in swordfish 
samples kept on ice. Among the chemical indices examined, thiobarbituric acid 
(TBA) values showed no specific trend of lipid oxidation for swordfish, 
irrespective of treatment. Final trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and total 
volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values for treatments, A, AO, M, and MO ranged 
between 1.33 and 14.29 mg N/100 g and 14.11 to 55.52 mg N/100 g, respectively, 
whereas for I samples they remained almost unchanged during storage. Sensory 
analysis (taste attribute) correlated well with microbiological analysis, 
indicating a shelf life of approximately 5 to 6 d for control, 10 to 11 d for 
AO, 12 d for I, 13 d for M, and 14 d for MO samples.

Dubin-Johnson syndrome.

Nisa AU(1), Ahmad Z.

Author information:

Karachi.

A young man presented with recurrent episodes of mild jaundice. Apart from 
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, other liver function tests were always normal. 
Clinical suspicion of Dubin-Johnson syndrome was raised. Liver biopsy showed 
diffuse deposition of coarse granular dark brown pigment in hepatocytes. 
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign condition, which results from a hereditary 
defect in biliary secretion of bilirubin pigments, and manifests as recurrent 
jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The defect is due to the absence of 
the canalicular protein MRP2 located on chromosomes 10q 24, which is responsible 
for the transport of biliary glucuronides and related organic anions into bile. 
No treatment is necessary and patients have a normal life expectancy.

Dentistry, 925 W. 34th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.

BACKGROUND: Saliva is being studied extensively and is being used for risk 
assessment, diagnosis and monitoring high-risk behavior and disease progression. 
A variety of medical conditions and medications are associated with salivary 
gland hypofunction. The major disadvantage in the use of saliva for 
health-related purposes is the lack of standardization in saliva collection 
methods.
METHODS: The authors provide a brief overview of different methods of saliva 
collection and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each method, as 
well as of how to assess the salivary flow rate.
RESULTS: The authors present the complete set up and step-by-step guidelines for 
the collection of unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva.
CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy of people will continue to increase with 
advances in medicine and therapeutic modalities, and the prevalence of salivary 
gland hypofunction in the elderly population will increase owing to their 
longevity. The assessment of salivary gland hypo-function will need to be 
incorporated into everyday clinical practice.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The saliva collection methods outlined in this article 
can be used by dentists to assess patients at risk of developing diseases and by 
scientists for scholarly activities.

    J Am Acad Orthop Surg. 2008 Sep;16(9):495-6; author reply 496.

During the past two decades, most total hip arthroplasties were performed with 
metal or ceramic heads on conventional polyethylene, an articulation associated 
with wear and limited life expectancy. Wear is associated with acetabular 
osteolysis. Isolated liner exchange has become a common surgical intervention 
when the acetabular component remains well-fixed. The purpose of isolated liner 
exchange is to prevent loosening of the components secondary to osteolysis and 
catastrophic mechanical failure caused by bearing wear-through. Treatment 
options for polyethylene wear include observation (in the asymptomatic hip), 
liner exchange, and more extensive revision procedures. Patients frequently 
present with asymptomatic but substantial polyethylene wear with or without 
associated osteolysis, the treatment of which is controversial. Other areas of 
debate include complete acetabular component removal to allow bone grafting and 
placement of an improved bearing surface, reuse of modular mechanisms, 
cementation into well-fixed shells, and whether to use periacetabular bone 
grafting.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The total number of people living with HIV has reached 39.5 
million. In developed countries, the major risk for HIV transmission is by 
heterosexual intercourse. The general condition and life expectancy of many 
patients with HIV infection is very good, and three-quarter of these individuals 
are in their reproductive years. For these reasons a large number of young 
couples are expected to make future plans to have children. Assisted 
reproduction in HIV-1 discordant couples has become important for clinicians in 
preventing HIV-1 transmission.
RECENT FINDINGS: The main theme covered in this article is epidemiology of HIV-1 
in the world, the biology of the virus present in the sperm, the recently 
published guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and 
ethics recommendations concerning assisted reproduction in people infected by 
virus, and all clinical aspects and scientific data published that have been 
modified to allow assisted reproduction in HIV-serodiscordant couples.
SUMMARY: To evaluate in clinical practice the safety of HIV-1 assisted 
reproduction with sperm washing and the outcome of assisted reproductive 
technologies offered to HIV-1 serodiscordant couples counselled for the 
prevention of HIV transmission.

Nemaline myopathy with exclusively intranuclear rods and a novel mutation in 
ACTA1 (Q139H).

Nemaline myopathies (NM) are a rare group of muscle disorders, but represent one 
of the most common forms of congenital myopathy. The clinical picture ranges 
from severe muscular hypotonia often leading to death during childhood to mild 
forms with long life expectancy. Diagnosis is made by muscle biopsy showing 
characteristic sarcoplasmic and sometimes intranuclear rod bodies. So far, 
disease-associated mutations have been detected in six genes without any simple 
correlation between genotype and phenotype or histological findings. We report a 
patient with a phenotype typical of congenital onset nemaline myopathy and 
exclusively intranuclear rods. Mutation analysis revealed a new heterozygous 
missense mutation in exon 3 of the ACTA1 gene (Q139H). Molecular modelling 
predicts that substitution of Q139 for H139 alters the amino acid side chains 
and hydrogen bonding which may alter the nucleotide binding cleft by adding 
'bulk' to the mutated molecule. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates 
that mutant actin Q139H is expressed at approximately half the level of 
wild-type actin in the patient's muscle. We speculate that these alterations, 
although not directly affecting the nuclear export signal, negatively interfere 
with the nuclear export of the mutated protein and thereby cause retention of 
mutant actin and intranuclear rod formation.

The GH-IGF-I axis and the cardiovascular system: clinical implications.

Colao A(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology, University 
of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy. colao@unina.it

BACKGROUND: GH and IGF-I affect cardiac structure and performance. In the 
general population, low IGF-I has been associated with higher prevalence of 
ischaemic heart disease and mortality. Both in GH deficiency (GHD) and excess 
life expectancy has been reported to be reduced because of cardiovascular 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: To review the role of the GH-IGF-I system on the cardiovascular 
system.
RESULTS: Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that serum IGF-I levels in the 
low-normal range are associated with increased risk of acute myocardial 
infarction, ischaemic heart disease, coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis 
and stroke. This confirms previous findings in patients with acromegaly or with 
GH-deficiency showing cardiovascular impairment. Patients with either childhood- 
or adulthood-onset GHD have cardiovascular abnormalities such as reduced cardiac 
mass, diastolic filling and left ventricular response at peak exercise, 
increased intima-media thickness and endothelial dysfunction. These 
abnormalities can be reversed, at least partially, after GH replacement therapy. 
In contrast, in acromegaly chronic GH and IGF-I excess causes a specific 
cardiomyopathy: concentric cardiac hypertrophy (in more than two-thirds of the 
patients at diagnosis) associated to diastolic dysfunction is the most common 
finding. In later stages, impaired systolic function ending in heart failure can 
occur, if GH/IGF-I excess is not controlled. Abnormalities of cardiac rhythm and 
of cardiac valves can also occur. Successful control of acromegaly is 
accompanied by decrease of the left ventricular mass and improvement of cardiac 
function.
CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular system is a target organ for GH and IGF-I. Subtle 
dysfunction in the GH-IGF-I axis are correlated with increased prevalence of 
ischaemic heart disease. Acromegaly and GHD are associated with several 
abnormalities of the cardiovascular system and control of GH/IGF-I secretion 
reverses (or at least stops) cardiovascular abnormalities.

Aortic valve replacement: choice between mechanical valves and bioprostheses.

Silberman S(1), Oren A, Dotan M, Merin O, Fink D, Deeb M, Bitran D.

Israel. ssilberman@szmc.org.il

BACKGROUND: The choice between a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve replacement 
device is not always clear, although patient age is most often the determining 
factor. We reviewed our experience with patients undergoing aortic valve 
replacement (AVR) in order to assess and compare long-term outcomes between 
patients receiving a mechanical valve and those receiving a bioprosthesis.
METHODS: Three hundred fifty-two patients underwent AVR with or without coronary 
artery bypass between 1993 and 2004: 189 received a mechanical valve and 163 a 
bioprosthesis. Events included: late mortality, thrombo-embolic events, stroke, 
bleeding events, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, reoperation, and coronary 
catheterization.
RESULTS: Patients in the bioprosthesis group were older (71 +/- 11 vs. 65 +/- 
13) than in the mechanical group (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in 
operative mortality (6.8%) or morbidity. Follow-up (61 +/- 40 months) was 
available in 87%. For mechanical valves and bioprostheses, respectively: 3-, 5-, 
and 10-year survival was 92%, 86%, and 69% versus 90%, 86%, and 71% (p = n.s.); 
and event-free survival was 79%, 68%, and 41% versus 79%, 68%, and 44% (p = 
n.s.). Five patients (3%) in each group required re-replacement of their aortic 
valve (p = n.s.). Coronary artery disease requiring bypass surgery did not 
affect long-term survival. Age at operation and renal failure were the only 
predictors for late mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival and event-free survival are similar for patients receiving 
a mechanical or biological aortic valve substitute. Selection of a valve 
replacement device should be based on life expectancy, patient preference, 
ability to take anticoagulants, lifestyle, risk of bleeding, and risk of 
reoperation. Patient age alone should not be the determining factor.

OBJECTIVE: We report on a series of female patients with transitional cell 
carcinoma of the bladder who underwent extraperitoneal retrograde radical 
cystectomy sparing the female reproductive organs with neobladder creation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 female patients between the ages of 45 and 72 years 
who underwent gynecologic-tract sparing cystectomy (GTSC) with neobladder 
between 1997 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. Our surgical technique is 
also described. Radical cystectomy is accomplished by a retrograde method 
sparing the uterus, adnexa, vagina and distal urethra. An orthotopic neobladder 
was constructed using small bowel or sigmoid colon, brought extraperitoneally, 
and anastomosed to the distal urethra.
RESULTS: Operating time ranged from 4.5 to six hours with a mean of 5.3 hours. 
Ten patients were able to void satisfactorily while four required 
self-catheterization for complete emptying of the bladder. Seven patients were 
continent day and night and another 7 reported varying degrees of daytime and 
nighttime incontinence. One patient died of metastases and another of pelvic 
recurrence. There were no urethral recurrences. Patient satisfaction with the 
procedure was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Gynecologic-tract sparing cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder is 
a viable alternative in female patients with muscle invasive traditional cell
