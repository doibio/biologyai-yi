INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to perform an economic assessment in 
order to check whether or not telemonitoring of users with pacemakers offers a 
cost-effective alternative to traditional follow-up in outpatient clinics.
METHODS: We used effectiveness and cost data from the NORDLAND trial, which is a 
controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial. Fifty patients were assigned 
to receive either telemonitoring (TM; n = 25) or conventional monitoring (CM; n 
= 25) and were followed up for 12 months after the implantation. A cost-utility 
analysis was performed in terms of additional costs per additional 
Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) attained from the perspectives of the 
Norwegian National Healthcare System and patients and their caregivers.
RESULTS: Effectiveness was similar between alternatives (TM: 0.7804 [CI: 0.6864 
to 0.8745] vs. CM: 0.7465 [CI: 0.6543 to 0.8387]), while cost per patient was 
higher in the RM group, both from the Norwegian NHS perspective (TM: €2,079.84 
[CI: 0.00 to 4,610.58] vs. €271.97 [CI: 158.18 to 385.76]; p = 0.147) and 
including the patient/family perspective (TM: €2,295.91 [CI: 0.00 to 4,843.28] 
vs. CM: €430.39 [CI: 0.00 to 4,841.48]), although these large differences-mainly 
due to a few patients being hospitalized in the TM group, as opposed to none in 
the CM group-did not reach statistical significance. The Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from the Norwegian NHS perspective 
(€53,345.27/QALY) and including the patient/caregiver perspective 
(€55,046.40/QALY), as well as the Incremental Net Benefit (INB), favors the CM 
alternative, albeit with very broad 95%CIs. The probabilistic analysis confirmed 
inconclusive results due to the wide CIs even suggesting that TM was not 
cost-effective in this study. Supplemental analysis excluding the 
hospitalization costs shows positive INBs, whereby suggesting a discrete 
superiority of the RM alternative if hospitalization costs were not considered, 
albeit also with broad CIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-utility analysis of TM vs. CM shows inconclusive results 
because of broad confidence intervals with ICER and INB figures ranging from 
potential savings to high costs for an additional QALY, with the majority of 
ICERs being above the usual NHS thresholds for coverage decisions.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains an important cause of morbidity 
and mortality. Pneumococcal vaccination is part of the South African pediatric 
public immunization program but the potential cost-effectiveness of such an 
intervention for adults is unknown. This study aimed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of two widely used pneumococcal vaccines: pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in 
South African adults, 18 years and older. Four analyses were carried out in a) 
both the private and public health care sectors; and b) for the HIV-infected 
population alone and for the total mixed population (all HIV-infected and 
-uninfected people). A previously published global pharmacoeconomic model was 
adapted and populated to represent the South African adult population. The model 
utilized a Markov-type process to depict the lifetime clinical and economic 
outcomes of patients who acquire pneumococcal disease in 2015, from a societal 
perspective. Costs were sourced in South African rand and converted to US dollar 
(USD). The incremental cost divided by the incremental effectiveness (expressed 
as quality-adjusted life years gained) represented the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for PCV13 compared to PPSV23. Results indicated that 
the use of PCV13 compared to PPSV23 is highly cost-effective in the public 
sector cohorts with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $771 
(R11,106)/quality-adjusted life year and $956 (R13,773)/quality-adjusted life 
year for the HIV-infected and mixed populations, respectively. The private 
sector cohort showed similar highly cost-effective results for the mixed 
population (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $626 (R9,013)/quality-adjusted 
life year) and the HIV-infected cohort (dominant). In sensitivity analysis, the 
model was sensitive to vaccine price and effectiveness. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses found predominantly cost-effective ICERs. From a societal 
perspective, these findings provide some guidance to policy makers for 
consideration and implementation of an immunization strategy for both the public 
and private sector and amongst different adult patient pools in South Africa.

OBJECTIVES: While previous cost-effectiveness studies on pembrolizumab in stage 
IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have found these regimens to be 
cost-effective, their reliance on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with 
strict inclusion criteria limits generalizability to patients with 
comorbidities. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of first-line pembrolizumab 
for patients with various comorbidities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our base case analysis, we studied pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy (pembrolizumab combination therapy) versus chemotherapy alone. In a 
secondary analysis, we considered only patients with PD-L1 expression of at 
least 50% (PD-L1-high) and evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab 
combination therapy, and chemotherapy alone. Microsimulation models were 
developed for the base case and the PD-L1-high analyses. To estimate outcomes of 
patients with differing comorbidities, we combined survival data from patients 
with few or no comorbidities from the RCTs with estimates from the general 
population obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER)-Medicare database. Comorbidity burden level was divided into three groups 
based on the Charlson score (equal to 0, 1, or 2+); patients with various other 
specific comorbidities were also analyzed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) were compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: In the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 2+ patient populations, 
estimated ICERs for pembrolizumab combination therapy in the base case model 
were $173,919/QALY, $175,165/QALY, and $181,777/QALY, respectively, compared to 
chemotherapy. In the PD-L1-high model, the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 
2+ patients had ICERs of $147,406/QALY, $149,026/QALY, and $154,521/QALY with 
pembrolizumab combination therapy versus chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy 
was weakly dominated for each comorbidity group in the PD-L1-high model.
CONCLUSION: For patients with stage IV NSCLC and varying comorbidity burden, 
first-line treatment with pembrolizumab does not represent a cost-effective 
strategy compared to chemotherapy. Resources should be focused on collecting 
immunotherapy survival data for more representative NSCLC patient populations.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease estimates are an important resource in public 
health. Currently, robust estimates are not available for the burn population. 
Our objectives are to adapt a refined methodology (INTEGRIS method) to burns and 
to apply this new INTEGRIS-burns method to estimate, and compare, the burden of 
disease of burn injuries in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands.
METHODS: Existing European and Western-Australian health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) datasets were combined to derive disability weights for three homogenous 
burn injury groups based on percentage total body surface area (%TBSA) burned. 
Subsequently, incidence data from Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands 
from 2010 to 2017 were used to compute annual non-fatal burden of disease 
estimates for each of these three countries. Non-fatal burden of disease was 
measured by years lived with disability (YLD).
RESULTS: The combined dataset included 7159 HRQL (EQ-5D-3 L) outcomes from 3401 
patients. Disability weights ranged from 0.046 (subgroup < 5% TBSA burned 
> 24 months post-burn) to 0.497 (subgroup > 20% TBSA burned 0-1 months 
post-burn). In 2017 the non-fatal burden of disease of burns for the three 
countries (YLDs/100,000 inhabitants) was 281 for Australia, 279 for New Zealand 
and 133 for the Netherlands.
CONCLUSIONS: This project established a method for more precise estimates of the 
YLDs of burns, as it is the only method adapted to the nature of burn injuries 
and their recovery. Compared to previous used methods, the INTEGRIS-burns method 
includes improved disability weights based on severity categorization of burn 
patients; a better substantiated proportion of patients with lifelong disability 
based; and, the application of burn specific recovery timeframes. Information 
derived from the adapted method can be used as input for health decision making 
at both the national and international level. Future studies should investigate 
whether the application is valid in low- and middle- income countries.

PURPOSE: Women who inherit a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant are at high risk 
of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Evidence for the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of long-term management in clinical practice is lacking. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the real-world cost-effectiveness of BRCA 
carrier management within a structured clinical program.
METHODS: Lifetime health outcomes and costs of clinical management for female 
unaffected BRCA carriers aged 20 were measured using a microsimulation model. 
For the intervention, women could attend a high-risk clinic, undergo 
risk-reducing surgery, and receive annual breast screening. Input data for the 
model was from a clinical database of 983 BRCA carriers. The comparator was no 
risk management. Outcomes were discounted at 5%.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the program was $32,359 to 
$48,263 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Limiting uptake of risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy to <50% of carriers decreased cost-effectiveness by 
$7000-8000 per QALY. Achieving perfect adherence to guidelines was less 
cost-effective for BRCA2 due to increased risk-reducing mastectomy costs with 
smaller incremental health benefit.
CONCLUSION: Long-term management of BRCA carriers within a structured clinical 
program is cost-effective. Suboptimal adherence to risk management guidelines 
can substantially affect outcomes and is an important consideration for future 
studies.

The hasty economic development in developing countries comes along with poorer 
air quality, which has severe toxicological effects on the environment and human 
health. This study is carried out to explore and empirically investigate the 
relationship between industrial pollution and health using the panel of 
middle-income countries (MIC) over 1990-2016. This study uses two indicators of 
health status, namely life expectancy and infant mortality, and two indicators 
of industrial pollution, namely carbon dioxide emissions and nitrous oxide 
emissions. This analysis is carried out using fixed effects (FE) technique on 
the grounds of the Hausman test. The empirical results suggest that industrial 
pollution tends to decrease life expectancy and increases infant mortality. In 
addition, this study suggests that the adverse impact of industrial pollution is 
greater in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC) in comparison with 
upper-middle-income countries (UMIC). This study recommends the programs to 
improve human health status and needs to focus on policies that mitigate 
industrial pollution burden.

BACKGROUND: In longevity societies, one of the most serious social issues is 
sarcopenia and/or frailty. Preventing them is important for maintaining 
independence and quality of life in the older population. This study 
investigated the effect of a self-monitoring comprehensive geriatric 
intervention programme (CGIP) on physical function and muscle size in 
community-dwelling older adults. We compared the effects of a CGIP using weekly 
class-styled (CS) sessions and a home-based (HB) programme.
METHODS: The 526 participants were randomized into one of two groups (CS 251, HB 
275) based on their residential districts. We conducted a 12 week CGIP, which 
consisted of low-load resistance exercise, physical activity increments, oral 
function improvements, and a nutritional guide. All participants were encouraged 
to attend two 90 min lectures that included instructions on the CGIP. They were 
provided with exercise materials (triaxial-accelerometers/pedometers, ankle 
weights, and elastic bands) and diary logs. The CS group attended 90 min weekly 
sessions and independently executed the programme on other days, whereas the HB 
group only received instructions on how to execute the programme. Physical 
functions, such as knee extension strength (KES), normal and maximum walking 
speed, the timed up-and-go test, and anterior thigh muscle thickness (MT), were 
measured and analysed using intention-to-treat analysis before and after the 12 
week intervention.
RESULTS: Of the 526 participants identified, 517 (CS 243 age 74.0 ± 5.4 women 
57.2%, HB 274 age 74.0 ± 5.6 women 58.8%) were enrolled. Nine (CS 8, HB 1) were 
excluded from the analysis because they did not participate in the 
pre-intervention measurements. Both interventions significantly improved KES (CS 
18.5%, HB 10.6%), normal walking speed (CS 3.7%, HB 2.8%), and MT (CS 3.2%, HB 
3.5%). Greater improvement of KES was observed in the CS group (P = 0.003). 
Maximum walking speed (CS 4.7%, HB 1.8%; P = 0.001) and timed up-and-go (CS 
-4.7%, HB -0.2%; P < 0.001) significantly improved in the CS group only.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was effective in preventing sarcopenia and/or 
frailty. Most physical functions and MT improved after both interventions. The 
HB intervention is cost-effective and may help prevent sarcopenia and/or frailty 
in the large older population.

performed to examine disease-specific mortality and prevalence trends for 
diseases in Korea from 2002 to 2015.
METHODS: In this study, 206 mutually exclusive diseases and injuries were 
classified into 21 cause clusters, which were divided into three cause groups: 
1) communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions; 2) 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and 3) injuries. Cause specific trends for 
age-standardized mortality and prevalence rates were analyzed by the joinpoint 
regression method.
RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2015, the age-standardized mortality declined to about 
177 per 100,000 population, while the age-standardized prevalence rate increased 
to approximately 68,065 per 100,000 population. Among the 21 cause clusters, 
most of the disease mortality rates showed decreasing trends. However, 
neurological disorders, self-harm, and interpersonal violence included periods 
during which the mortality rates increased in 2002-2015. In addition, the trends 
for prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, transport injuries, and self-harm, and 
interpersonal violence differed from the overall prevalence rates. The annual 
percent change in prevalence rates for transport injuries increased during 
2004-2007, and then decreased. The self-harm and interpersonal violence 
prevalence rates decreased from 2004 to 2014.
CONCLUSION: Between 2002 and 2015, overall decreasing trends in the mortality 
rate and increasing trends in the prevalence rate were observed for all causes 
in Korea. Especially, NCDs represented an important part of the increasing 
trends in Korea. For clusters of diseases with unusual trends, proper management 
must be considered.

Memory formation, guided by microbial ligands, has been reported for innate 
immune cells. Epigenetic imprinting plays an important role herein, involving 
histone modification after pathogen-/danger-associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs/DAMPs) recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Such "trained 
immunity" affects not only the nominal target pathogen, yet also non-related 
targets that may be encountered later in life. The concept of trained innate 
immunity warrants further exploration in cancer and how these insights can be 
implemented in immunotherapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss our 
current understanding of innate immune memory and we reference new findings in 
this field, highlighting the observations of trained immunity in monocytic and 
natural killer cells. We also provide a brief overview of trained immunity in 
non-immune cells, such as stromal cells and fibroblasts. Finally, we present 
possible strategies based on trained innate immunity that may help to devise 
host-directed immunotherapies focusing on cancer, with possible extension to 
infectious diseases.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel versus aspirin for 
high risk patients (pre-existing symptomatic atherosclerosis or multi-vascular 
territory involvement) with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD) for 
secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in a Chinese setting.Methods: A 
Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the perspective of the 
national healthcare system in China. The primary outputs are quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Clinical efficacy data were obtained from the CAPRIE trial. Drug 
acquisition cost, other direct medical costs, and utilities were from pricing 
records and the literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to test the robustness of the model on 
all parameters.Results: In patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis, 2 years 
of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin would yield total QALYs of 8.776 and 
8.576 at associated costs of ¥18,777 ($2,838) and ¥12,302 ($1,859), 
respectively, resulting in an ICER of ¥32,382 ($4,893) per QALY gained. In 
patients with PVD, secondary prevention with the same drugs would expect to lead 
to total QALYs of 8.836 and 8.632 at associated costs of ¥18,518 ($2,798) and 
¥12,041 ($1,820), respectively, resulting in a corresponding ICER of ¥31,743 
($4,797) per QALY gained. The results were most sensitive to the discount rate 
for future outcomes and costs. The PSA indicated that the probability of 
clopidogrel being cost-effective was 100% at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
3-times GDP.Conclusions: Secondary prevention with clopidogrel is an attractive 
cost-effective option compared with aspirin for high risk patients with 
established PAD from the perspective of the national healthcare system in 
Chinese settings.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders, severe bipolar disorder, or severe recurrent major 
depressive disorder have a shorter life expectancy compared with those in the 
general population. This is largely due to the higher rates of diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Treatment adherence, diet, exercise, and 
weight management are modifiable risk factors for these cardiometabolic 
conditions, yet the use of educational lifestyle interventions is not common 
practice in the clinical setting. AIM: The purpose of this project was to 
evaluate a 12-week evidence-based diabetes prevention education program 
integrated into a primary care behavioral health setting for adults with SMI, 
diabetes, or prediabetes, and who were overweight or obese. METHOD: This project 
utilized a pretest-posttest intervention design. Outcomes for this project 
included diabetes knowledge, self-care, and health indicators (blood pressure, 
hemoglobin A1C, weight, body mass index, and medication adherence). The project 
also addressed feasibility and acceptability of the program in this setting. 
RESULTS: Project outcomes showed a reduction in weight, waist circumference, 
hemoglobin A1C, and blood pressure. Outcomes also indicated an improvement in 
participants' self-knowledge and self-care. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high 
attendance rate and overall acceptability and feasibility described by 
participants. This project highlights the important role that primary care 
providers can play in providing health education to patients with SMI.

BACKGROUND: People with psychotic disorders have reduced life expectancy largely 
because of physical health problems, especially cardiovascular disease, that are 
complicated by the use of tobacco and cannabis.
OBJECTIVES: We set out to (1) chart lifestyle and substance use choices and the 
emergence of cardiometabolic risk from the earliest presentation with psychosis, 
(2) develop a pragmatic health promotion intervention integrated within the 
clinical teams to improve the lifestyle choices and health outcomes of people 
with psychosis and (3) evaluate the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of that health promotion intervention.
DESIGN: We performed a longitudinal cohort study of people presenting with their 
first episode of psychosis in three mental health trusts and followed up 
participants for 1 year [work package 1, physical health and substance use 
measures in first episode of psychosis (PUMP)]. We used an iterative Delphi 
methodology to develop and refine a modular health promotion intervention, 
improving physical health and reducing substance use in psychosis (IMPaCT) 
therapy, which was to be delivered by the patient’s usual care co-ordinator and 
used motivational interviewing techniques and cognitive–behavioural therapy to 
improve health choices of people with psychosis (work package 2). We then 
conducted a multicentre, two-arm, parallel-cluster, randomised controlled trial 
to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using the 
intervention with people with established psychosis (work package 3: IMPaCT 
randomised controlled trial) in five UK mental health trusts. The work took 
place between 2008 and 2014.
PARTICIPANTS: All people aged between 16 and 65 years within 6 months of their 
first presentation with a non-organic psychosis and who were proficient in 
English were eligible for inclusion in the PUMP study. Participants in the work 
package 2 training development were staff selected from a range of settings, 
working with psychosis. Participants in the phase 3 Delphi consensus and manual 
development comprised three expert groups of (1) therapists/researchers 
recruited from the local and national community, (2) clinicians and (3) service 
users, each of whom took part in two iterative review and feedback sessions. For 
work package 3, IMPaCT randomised controlled trial, care co-ordinators in 
participating community mental health teams who were permanently employed and 
had a minimum of four eligible patients (i.e. aged between 18 and 65 years with 
a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder) on their caseload were eligible to 
participate. In studies 1 and 3, patient participants were ineligible if they 
were pregnant or had a major illness that would have had an impact on their 
metabolic status or if they had a significant learning disability. All 
participants were included in the study only after giving written confirmed 
consent.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiometabolic risk markers, including rates of obesity 
and central obesity, and levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipids, were 
the main outcomes in work package 1 (PUMP), with descriptive data presented on 
substance use. Our primary outcome measure for the IMPaCT randomised controlled 
trial was the physical or mental health component Short Form questionnaire-36 
items quality-of-life scores at 12 months.
RESULTS: Obesity rates rose from 18% at first presentation with psychosis to 24% 
by 1 year, but cardiometabolic risk was not associated with baseline lifestyle 
and substance use choices. Patterns of increase in the levels of HbA1c over the 
year following first presentation showed variation by ethnic group. We recruited 
104 care co-ordinators, of whom 52 (with 213 patients) were randomised to 
deliver IMPaCT therapy and 52 (with 193 patients) were randomised to deliver 
treatment as usual, in keeping with our power calculations. Of these 406 
participants with established psychosis, 318 (78%) and 301 (74%) participants, 
respectively, attended the 12- and 15-month follow-ups. We found no significant 
effect of IMPaCT therapy compared with treatment as usual on the physical or 
mental health component Short Form questionnaire-36 items scores at either time 
point in an intention-to-treat analysis [physical health score (‘d’) –0.17 at 12 
months and –0.09 at 15 months; mental health score (‘d’) 0.03 at 12 months and 
–0.05 at 15 months] or on costs. Nor did we find an effect on other 
cardiovascular risk indicators, including diabetes, except in the case of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which showed a trend for greater benefit 
with IMPaCT therapy than with treatment as usual (treatment effect 0.085, 95% 
confidence interval 0.007 to 0.16; p = 0.034).
LIMITATIONS: Follow-up in work package 1 was challenging, with 127 out of 293 
participants attending; however, there was no difference in cardiometabolic 
measures or demographic factors at baseline between those who attended for 
follow-up and those who did not. In work package 3, the IMPaCT randomised 
controlled trial, care co-ordinators struggled to provide additional time to 
their patients that was devoted to the health promotion intervention on top of 
their usual clinical care contact with them.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiometabolic risk is prominent even soon after first 
presentation with psychosis and increases over time. Lifestyle choices and 
substance use habits at first presentation do not predict those who will be most 
cardiometabolically compromised 1 year later. Training and supervising care 
co-ordinators to deliver a health promotion intervention to their own patients 
on top of routine care is not effective in the NHS for improving quality of life 
or reducing cardiometabolic risk.
FUTURE WORK: Further work is needed to develop and evaluate effective, 
cost-effective and affordable ways of preventing the emergence of and reversing 
existing cardiometabolic risk indicators in people with psychosis.

scores.

BACKGROUND: In 2015, approximately 2.16% of adults were recorded as having 
intellectual disabilities. UK government policy is that adults with intellectual 
disabilities should access mainstream health services. However, people with 
intellectual disabilities experience challenges when accessing primary and 
community health services that can lead to inequalities and shorter life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To map and review the evidence on access to primary and community 
health-care services for adults with intellectual disabilities and their carers. 
To identify influencing factors for gaining access to primary and community 
health-care services. To determine which actions, interventions or models of 
service provision improve entry access to these services for people with 
intellectual disabilities and their carers. Finally, to identify the gaps in 
evidence and provide implications for health care and recommendations for 
research.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Applied Social Sciences Index and 
Abstracts (ASSIA) and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) were 
searched from 2002 to 2018.
REVIEW METHODS: The mapping review methodology included an extensive literature 
search, article selection and data extraction of relevant abstracts. Findings 
from the mapping review informed the scope of the targeted systematic review. 
Methodology for the targeted systematic review included an extensive literature 
search informed by the mapping review, article selection, data extraction, 
quality appraisal and narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: The mapping review included 413 studies with data extraction completed 
on abstracts. The targeted systematic review synthesised the evidence from 80 
studies reported in 82 publications. During the review process, the team 
identified three key points at which people with intellectual disabilities 
potentially interacted with primary and community health-care services: 
identifying needs, accessing services and interaction during a consultation. In 
addition, there were a number of papers about interventions or innovations to 
improve access. Evidence from the studies was synthesised within the four 
clusters. Influencing factors were identified: staff knowledge/skills, joint 
working with learning disability services, service delivery model, uptake, 
appointment making, carer/support role, relationship with staff, time, 
accessible information and communication. The influencing factors were 
cross-cutting through the literature, with certain factors having more 
importance in certain clusters.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitation was the weak evidence base. The studies 
generally had small samples, had study designs that were open to potential 
biases and measured only short-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Health checks were found to help identify health needs and improve 
the care of long-term conditions. Important factors for accessing health 
services for adults with intellectual disabilities were consistency of care and 
support, staff training, communication skills and time to communicate, and 
provision of accessible information. Health professionals need to ensure that 
there is joint working between different services, clear communication and 
accurate record-keeping. Future research questions centre on the need to develop 
and value creative study designs capable of addressing the complex issues 
identified in the findings of the review for this complex population.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that low-dose 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including rivaroxaban and apixaban, may help 
reduce the incidence of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE).
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the health sector 
perspective using a Markov state-transition model in patients with cancer who 
are at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE. Transition probability, relative risk, 
cost, and utility inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of the RCTs and 
relevant epidemiology studies. Differences in cost, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient were 
calculated over a lifetime horizon. One-way, probabilistic, and scenario 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In patients with cancer at intermediate-to-high risk for VTE, treatment 
with low-dose DOAC thromboprophylaxis for 6 months, compared with placebo, was 
associated with 32 per 1000 fewer VTE and 11 per 1000 more major bleeding 
episodes over a lifetime. The incremental cost and QALY increases were $1445 and 
0.12, respectively, with an ICER of $11,947 per QALY gained. Key drivers of ICER 
variations included the relative risks of VTE and bleeding as well as drug cost. 
This strategy was 94% cost effective at the threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The 
selection of patients with Khorana scores ≥3 yielded the greatest value, with an 
ICER of $5794 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose DOAC thromboprophylaxis for 6 months appears to be 
cost-effective in patients with cancer who are at intermediate-to-high risk for 
VTE. The implementation of this strategy in patients with Khorana scores ≥3 may 
lead to the highest cost-benefit ratio.
