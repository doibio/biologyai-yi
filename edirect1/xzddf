Patients with chronic multimorbidity are becoming more common as life expectancy 
increases, making it necessary for physicians to develop complex management 
plans. We are looking at the patient management process as a goal-attainment 
problem. Hence, our aim is to develop a goal-oriented methodology for providing 
decision support for managing patients with multimorbidity continuously, as the 
patient's health state is progressing and new goals arise (e.g., treat ulcer, 
prevent osteoporosis). Our methodology allows us to detect and mitigate 
inconsistencies among guideline recommendations stemming from multiple clinical 
guidelines, while consulting medical ontologies and terminologies and relying on 
patient information standards. This methodology and its implementation as a 
decision-support system, called GoCom, starts with computer-interpretable 
clinical guidelines (CIGs) for single problems that are formalized using the 
PROforma CIG language. We previously published the architecture of the system as 
well as a CIG elicitation guide for enriching PROforma tasks with properties 
referring to vocabulary codes of goals and physiological effects of management 
plans. In this paper, we provide a formalization of the conceptual model of 
GoCom that generates, for each morbidity of the patient, a patient-specific goal 
tree that results from the PROforma engine's enactment of the CIG with the 
patient's data. We also present the "Controller" algorithm that drives the GoCom 
system. Given a new problem that a patient develops, the Controller detects 
inconsistencies among goals pertaining to different comorbid problems and 
consults the CIGs to generate alternative non-conflicted and goal-oriented 
management plans that address the multiple goals simultaneously. In this stage 
of our research, the inconsistencies that can be detected are of two types - 
starting vs. stopping medications that belong to the same medication class 
hierarchy, and detecting opposing physiological effect goals that are specified 
in concurrent CIGs (e.g., decreased blood pressure vs. increased blood 
pressure). However, the design of GoCom is modular and generic and allows the 
future introduction of additional interaction detection and mitigation 
strategies. Moreover, GoCom generates explanations of the alternative 
non-conflicted management plans, based on recommendations stemming from the 
clinical guidelines and reasoning patterns. GoCom's functionality was evaluated 
using three cases of multimorbidity interactions that were checked by our three 
clinicians. Usefulness was evaluated with two studies. The first evaluation was 
a pilot study with ten 6th year medical students and the second evaluation was 
done with 27 6th medical students and interns. The participants solved complex 
realistic cases of multimorbidity patients: with and without decision-support, 
two cases in the first evaluation and 6 cases in the second evaluation. Use of 
GoCom increased completeness of the patient management plans produced by the 
medical students from 0.44 to 0.71 (P-value of 0.0005) in the first evaluation, 
and from 0.31 to 0.78 (P-value < 0.0001) in the second evaluation. Correctness 
in the first evaluation was very high with (0.98) or without the system (0.91), 
with non-significant difference (P-value ≥ 0.17). In the second evaluation, use 
of GoCom increased correctness from 0.68 to 0.83 (P-value of 0.001). In 
addition, GoCom's explanation and visualization were perceived as useful by the 
vast majority of participants. While GoCom's detection of goal interactions is 
currently limited to detection of starting vs. stopping the same medication or 
medication subclasses and detecting conflicting physiological effects of 
concurrent medications, the evaluation demonstrated potential of the system for 
improving clinical decision-making for multimorbidity patients.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy treatment on muscle 
strength, quality of life, fatigue, and anxiety in women with breast cancer. 
Nineteen women who were undergoing a chemotherapy treatment (breast cancer 
treatment [BCT] group, 52.2 ± 13.1 years) and 18 women without cancer (control 
[CNT] group, 55.8 ± 8.4 years) answered questionnaires for evaluation of fatigue 
(Fatigue Scale), quality of life (Short-Form Healthy Survey [SF-36] 
questionnaire), and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [IDATE]) levels. 
Muscle strength was also assessed by an isometric grip test and an isokinetic 
knee extension test. Physical limitations, social and emotional domains of 
quality of life were lower in the BCT group in comparison to the CNT group (p = 
0.002; p = 0.003; p = 0.0003, respectively). The other domains did not differ 
between groups (p > 0.05). There were no differences in fatigue and anxiety 
levels between both the BCT and CNT groups (p > 0.05). Additionally, isometric 
grip strength was higher in the CNT group when compared to the BCT group (p = 
0.048). However, there were no differences between the BCT and CNT groups for 
peak torque and total work at both 60°.s-1 (p = 0.95 and p = 0.61, respectively) 
and 180°.s-1 (p = 0.94 and p = 0.72, respectively). These results suggest that 
three cycles of chemotherapy treatment may impair handgrip isometric strength 
and quality of life in women with breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The number of heart failure (HF) patients has been rapidly 
increasing in Japan, and considering the most explosive aging occurring in Asia, 
the management of elderly HF patients and longer life expectancy are critical 
issues. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the mid-term 
prognosis after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation was 
influenced by age and to investigate, in detail, the difference in the change 
ratio of echocardiographic parameters according to the age group of interest.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective analysis included 173 patients who 
underwent CRT implantation in our hospital from February 2008 to March 2019. 
Eighty patients (46%) were classified into the elderly group (≥75 years) and the 
rest in the non-elderly group. The study population was also classified with 
propensity score matching. The mid-term prognosis including all-cause death and 
hospitalization for HF, and the ratio of CRT responders were compared between 
the 2 groups. CRT response was defined as left ventricular (LV) end-systolic 
volume reduction ≥15% at follow-up echocardiography within a year. During a 
median follow-up of 1057 [interquartile range: 412, 2107] days, adverse events 
were not significantly different between the 2 groups before and after matching 
(before matching; all-cause death: log-rank p = 0.323, hospitalization for HF: 
log-rank p = 0.376, after matching; all-cause death: log-rank p = 0.325, 
hospitalization for HF: log-rank p = 0.516). Moreover, the rate of CRT 
responders was not significantly different between the 2 groups before and after 
matching (before matching, p = 0.718; after matching, p = 0.666).
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly HF patients, CRT provided the same clinical benefits as 
in non-elderly HF patients, furthermore, there was a similar trend in LV reverse 
remodeling between the 2 groups. The present study demonstrated that the 
indication of CRT implantation should not be determined by age.

The nascent polypeptide exit tunnel (NPET) is a major functional center of 60S 
ribosomal subunits. However, little is known about how the NPET is constructed 
during ribosome assembly. We utilized molecular genetics, biochemistry, and 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the functions of two 
NPET-associated proteins, ribosomal protein uL4 and assembly factor Nog1, in 
NPET assembly. Structures of mutant pre-ribosomes lacking the tunnel domain of 
uL4 reveal a misassembled NPET, including an aberrantly flexible ribosomal RNA 
helix 74, resulting in at least three different blocks in 60S assembly. 
Structures of pre-ribosomes lacking the C-terminal extension of Nog1 demonstrate 
that this extension scaffolds the tunnel domain of uL4 in the NPET to help 
maintain stability in the core of pre-60S subunits. Our data reveal that uL4 and 
Nog1 work together in the maturation of ribosomal RNA helix 74, which is 
required to ensure proper construction of the NPET and 60S ribosomal subunits.

Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion.

BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation represents an opportunity to reduce both short and 
long-term effects of smoking on complications after lumbar fusion and 
smoking-related morbidity and mortality. However, the cost-effectiveness of 
smoking-cessation interventions prior to lumbar fusion is not fully known.
METHODS: We created a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of 5 smoking-cessation strategies (behavioral counseling, 
nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion or varenicline monotherapy, and a 
combined intervention) prior to single-level, instrumented lumbar posterolateral 
fusion (PLF) from the health payer perspective. Probabilities, costs, and 
utilities were obtained from published sources. We calculated the costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each strategy over multiple 
time horizons and accounted for uncertainty with probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSAs) consisting of 10,000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: Every smoking-cessation intervention was more effective and less costly 
than usual care at the lifetime horizon. In the short term, behavioral 
counseling, NRT, varenicline monotherapy, and the combined intervention were 
also cost-saving, while bupropion monotherapy was more effective but more costly 
than usual care. The mean lifetime cost savings for behavioral counseling, NRT, 
bupropion monotherapy, varenicline monotherapy, and the combined intervention 
were $3,291 (standard deviation [SD], $868), $2,571 (SD, $479), $2,851 (SD, 
$830), $6,767 (SD, $1,604), and $34,923 (SD, $4,248), respectively. The minimum 
efficacy threshold (relative risk for smoking cessation) for lifetime cost 
savings varied from 1.01 (behavioral counseling) to 1.15 (varenicline 
monotherapy). A PSA revealed that the combined smoking-cessation intervention 
was always more effective and less costly than usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Even brief smoking-cessation interventions yield large short-term 
and long-term cost savings. Smoking-cessation interventions prior to PLF can 
both reduce costs and improve patient outcomes as health payers/systems shift 
toward value-based reimbursement (e.g., bundled payments) or population health 
models.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a scoring system to predict morbidity for patients 
undergoing metastatic spinal tumor surgery (MSTS).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multiple scoring systems exist to predict survival 
for patients with spinal metastasis. The potential benefits and risks of surgery 
need to be evaluated for patients with disseminated cancer and limited life 
expectancy. Few scoring systems exist to predict perioperative morbidity after 
MSTS.
METHODS: We reviewed records of patients who underwent MSTS at our institution 
between 2013 and 2019. All perioperative complications occurring within 30 days 
were recorded. A clinical scoring system consisting of five variables (age ≥ 70 
yr, hypoalbuminemia, poor preoperative functional status [Karnofsky ≤ 40], 
Frankel Grade A-C, and multilevel disease ≥2 continuous vertebral bodies) was 
evaluated as a predictive tool for morbidity; every parameter was assigned a 
value of 0 if absent or 1 if present (total possible score = 5). The effect of 
the scoring system on morbidity was evaluated using stepwise multiple logistic 
regression. Model accuracy was calculated by receiver operating characteristic 
analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred and five patients were identified, with a male prevalence 
of 58.1% and average age at surgery of 61 years. The overall 30-day complication 
rate was 36.2%. The perioperative morbidity was 4.6%, 30.0%, 53.9%, and 64.7% 
for patients with scores of 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 points, respectively (P < 0.001). On 
multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for covariates not present in 
the model, the scoring system was significantly associated with 30-day morbidity 
(OR 3.11; 95% CI, 1.72-5.59; P < 0.001). The model's accuracy was estimated at 
0.75.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed model was found to accurately predict perioperative 
morbidity after MSTS. The Spine Oncology Morbidity Assessment (SOMA) score may 
prove useful for risk stratification and possibly decision-making, though 
further validation is needed.Level of Evidence: 4.

A growing number of epidemiological studies have been affirming the linking 
between fine particles (PM2.5) and deaths due to diverse causes as a result of 
long-term exposure. This work demonstrates the benefits of improving air quality 
policies by evaluating the impact of PM2.5 in terms of avoidable mortality due 
to all causes, cardiopulmonary causes, and lung cancer, between 2014 and 2018, 
for 5570 Brazilian cities. Satellite annual surface PM2.5 concentrations were 
compared with available monitoring measurements and used as the baseline 
scenario. Each phase of the Brazilian air quality legislation (CONAMA 491/2018) 
was used as a control scenario. The satellite PM2.5 annual surface levels were 
slightly lower than the monitoring concentrations, with an average mean bias of 
-2.7 μg/m3. No annual mean PM2.5 concentration above 20 μg/m3 was observed in 
any city in 2014 and 2018. In 2016, 23% of cities exceeded the annual mean 
concentration of 10 μg/m3. A weak positive correlation was found between 
city-level PM2.5 and population, vehicle fleet, number of fire outbreaks, urban 
area size, Growth Domestic Product per capita, Human Development Index, and life 
expectancy. During the five years, a total of 48,700 ± 7570 deaths due to all 
causes, 24,100 ± 3260 due to cardiopulmonary causes, and 1780 ± 435 due to lung 
cancer could be avoided if the maximum PM2.5 annual concentration of 10 μg/m3 
was not exceeded. Less restrictive standards lead to much lower avoidable 
deaths. For example, considering the maximum annual concentration of 20 μg/m3, 
1335 ± 175 deaths due to all causes could be avoided between 2015 and 2017. Our 
results indicate the importance of adopting more restrictive air quality 
standards in Brazil. If the current levels do not protect life as they should 
be, an effort regarding control emissions, monitoring, and modeling is essential 
to construct an effective air quality management for the country, aiming to 
comprehend the current PM2.5 concentration and to achieve lower standards.

Burden of Disease studies-such as the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study-quantify health loss in disability-adjusted life-years. However, these 
studies stop short of quantifying the future impact of interventions that shift 
risk factor distributions, allowing for trends and time lags. This methodology 
paper explains how proportional multistate lifetable (PMSLT) modelling 
quantifies intervention impacts, using comparisons between three tobacco control 
case studies [eradication of tobacco, tobacco-free generation i.e. the age at 
which tobacco can be legally purchased is lifted by 1 year of age for each 
calendar year) and tobacco tax]. We also illustrate the importance of 
epidemiological specification of business-as-usual in the comparator arm that 
the intervention acts on, by demonstrating variations in simulated health gains 
when incorrectly: (i) assuming no decreasing trend in tobacco prevalence; and 
(ii) not including time lags from quitting tobacco to changing disease 
incidence. In conjunction with increasing availability of baseline and forecast 
demographic and epidemiological data, PMSLT modelling is well suited to future 
multiple country comparisons to better inform national, regional and global 
prioritization of preventive interventions. To facilitate use of PMSLT, we 
introduce a Python-based modelling framework and associated tools that 
facilitate the construction, calibration and analysis of PMSLT models.

As life expectancy increases, long periods of comorbidity and low quality of 
life commonly precede death. Advance care planning within primary care settings 
is necessary to increase patient agency and prioritize personal wishes. This 
article disseminates a quality improvement initiative within a federally 
qualified health center. New procedures were developed to systematically track 
advance directive conversations using current procedural terminology codes. The 
systems change resulted in a substantial and sustained increase in advance 
directive conversation documentation. The increase was presumably due to the 
implementation of small-scale changes, providers' commitment to geriatric 
primary care, increases in appointment times, allocation of tasks across 
disciplines, availability of Spanish speaking staff and translated forms, and 
the change to record keeping that enabled codes to be easily captured and 
tracked in the electronic medical record. This work may inform future quality 
improvement efforts to boost advance care planning among underserved populations 
in diverse settings.

BACKGROUND: The ideal measure of success after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse 
has long been debated. Historically, strict definitions based on anatomic 
perfection have dominated the literature. However, the importance of 
patient-centered perception of outcomes is equally or more important when 
comparing the success of various prolapse surgeries. Understanding the 
limitations of existing outcome definitions will guide surgical outcome 
reporting and comparisons of pelvic organ prolapse surgeries.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the relationships and overlap among the 
participants who met the anatomic, subjective, and retreatment definitions of 
success or failure after pelvic organ prolapse surgery; demonstrate rates of 
transition between success and failure over time; and compare scores from the 
Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, Short-Form Six-Dimension health index, 
and quality-adjusted life years among these definitions.
STUDY DESIGN: Definitions of surgical success were evaluated at 3 or 6, 12, 24, 
36, 48, and 60 months after surgery for ≥stage II pelvic organ prolapse in a 
cohort of women (N=1250) from 4 randomized clinical trials conducted by the 
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. Surgical failure was defined by a composite 
measure requiring 1 or more of (1) anatomic failure (Pelvic Organ Prolapse 
Quantification point Ba, Bp, or C of >0), (2) subjective failure (presence of 
bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms), or (3) pessary or surgical retreatment for 
pelvic organ prolapse. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, Short-Form 
Six-Dimension health index, and quality-adjusted life years were compared among 
participants who met a variety of definitions of success and failure including 
novel "intermittent" success and failure over time.
RESULTS: Among the 433 of 1250 women (34.6%) who had surgical failure outcomes 
at ≥1 time point, 85.5% (370 of 433) met only 1 component of the composite 
outcome at the assessment of initial failure (anatomic failure, 46.7% [202 of 
433]; subjective failure, 36.7% [159 of 433]; retreatment, 2.1% [9 of 433]). 
Only 12.9% (56 of 433) met the criteria for both for anatomic and subjective 
failure. Despite meeting the criteria for failure in primary study reporting, 
24.2% of these (105 of 433) transitioned between success and failure during 
follow-up, of whom 83.8% (88 of 105) met the criteria for success at their last 
follow-up. There were associations between success or failure classification and 
the 1- and 2-year quality-adjusted life years and a time-varying group effect on 
Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory and Short-Form Six-Dimension health 
index scores.
CONCLUSION: True failure rates after prolapse surgery may be overestimated in 
the current literature. Only 13% of clinical trial subjects initially met both 
subjective and objective criteria for failure. Approximately one-quarter of 
failures were intermittent and transitioned between success and failure over 
time, with most intermittent failures being in a state of "surgical success" at 
their last follow-up. Current composite definitions of success or failure may 
result in the overestimation of surgical failure rates, potentially explaining, 
in part, the discordance with low retreatment rates after pelvic organ prolapse 
surgery.

OBJECTIVES: This study compared ways of describing treatment effects. The 
objective was to better explain to clinicians and patients what they might 
expect from a given treatment, not only in terms of relative and absolute risk 
reduction, but also in projections of long-term survival.
BACKGROUND: The restricted mean survival time (RMST) can be used to estimate of 
long-term survival, providing a complementary approach to more conventional 
metrics (e.g., absolute and relative risk), which may suggest greater benefits 
of therapy in high-risk patients compared with low-risk patients.
METHODS: Relative and absolute risk, as well as the RMST, were calculated in 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) trials.
RESULTS: As examples, in the RALES trial (more severe HFrEF), the treatment 
effect metrics for spironolactone versus placebo on heart failure 
hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death were a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 0.77), number needed to treat = 9 (7 to 
14), and age extension of event-free survival +1.1 years (-0.1 to + 2.3 years). 
The corresponding metrics for EMPHASIS-HF (eplerenone vs. placebo in less severe 
HFrEF) were 0.64 (0.54 to 0.75), 14 (1 to 22), and +2.9 (1.2 to 4.5). In 
patients in PARADIGM-HF aged younger than 65 years, the metrics for 
sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.88), 23 (15 
to 44), and +1.7 (0.6 to 2.8) years; for those aged 65 years or older, the 
metrics were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94), 29 (17 to 83), and +0.9 (0.2 to 1.6) 
years, which provided evidence of a greater potential life extension in younger 
patients. Similar observations were found for lower risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: RMST event-free (and overall) survival estimates provided a 
complementary means of evaluating the effect of therapy in relation to age and 
risk. They also provided a clinically useful metric that should be routinely 
reported and used to explain the potential long-term benefits of a given 
treatment, especially to younger and less symptomatic patients.

OBJECTIVE: Treatment is usually withheld from women with osteopenia even though 
they are the source of over 70% of all women having fragility fractures. As 
microstructural deterioration increases fracture risk and zoledronate reduces 
it, we aimed to determine whether identifying and treating women with osteopenia 
and severe microstructural deterioration is cost-effective. We also compared the 
health economic outcomes of 'global' versus 'targeted' treatment using SFS of 
women aged ≥70 years with osteopenia.
DESIGN: We assessed the cost-effectiveness from using a Markov model that 
simulated 10-year follow up of women with osteopenia. Decision analysis compared 
measurement of distal radial microstructure using high resolution peripheral 
computed tomography (at a cost of USD $210) to target women with severe 
microstructural deterioration for zoledronate treatment, compared to standard 
care defined as measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) with treatment 
recommended when femoral neck BMD T score is ≤-2.5 SD with or without a 
prevalent fracture. In the 'global' treatment approach, high resolution 
peripheral quantitative tomography (HRpQCT) was not undertaken.
SETTING: US healthcare system.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 women aged ≥70 years with osteopenia 
and no previous fractures was studied.
MEASURES: Fractures, deaths, years of life lived, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) lived and costs. Data inputs were obtained from published sources. A 3% 
annual discount rate was applied to future health benefits and costs.
RESULTS: Women in the standard care group incurred 327 fractures during 
7341.0 years and 4914.2 QALYs lived. Women in the intervention group incurred 
300 fractures (number needed to treat 37) during 7359.2 years and 4928.8 QALYs 
lived. Net costs were USD $4,862,669 and $4,952,004, respectively, equating to 
18.1 years of life saved and 14.6 QALYs saved, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $4992 per year of life saved and $6135 per QALY 
saved. These ratios are well within the threshold considered to be 
cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses indicated the results were robust. Relative 
to standard of care, 'global' and 'targeted' treatment respectively resulted in 
0.0364 vs. 0.0181 years of life (YoLS) saved per person, and 0.0292 and 0.0146 
QALYs saved per person. The net costs per person for the respective approaches 
were $US 359 and $US 89. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $9864 
per YoLS and $12,290 per QALY saved for the 'global' approach and $4992 per YoLS 
and $6135 per QALY saved for the 'targeted' approach.
CONCLUSION: Identifying and treating women ≥70 years of age with osteopenia and 
microstructural deterioration with zoledronate cost-effectively reduces the 
morbidity and mortality imposed by fragility fractures. This 'targeted' approach 
is more cost-effective than a 'global' approach and incurs only 25% of total 
costs.
IMPLICATION: Women with osteopenia with bone fragility due to microstructural 
deterioration should be identified and targeted for treatment.
SUMMARY: Women with osteopenia have 70% of fractures. Treating those with 
microstructural deterioration conferred an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of $4992/year of life saved and $6135 per QALY saved.

OBJECTIVE: Cancers result in significant economic burdens on patients, health 
sectors and society. Reliable burden estimates will help guide resource 
allocation. This study aimed to perform a nationwide cost analysis of the direct 
and indirect costs of the top ten most costly cancers, and acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS), as a comparison, in Taiwan.
SETTING: A population-based cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: In total, 545 221 patients with newly diagnosed cancer (lung 
cancer, female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, oral cancer, 
leukaemia, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric cancer and 
oesophageal cancer) and 170 879 patients with ACS between 2007 and 2014 were 
identified.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct medical costs were calculated 
from claims recorded in the National Health Insurance Research Database . 
Indirect costs, comprising morbidity-associated and mortality-associated 
productivity losses, were estimated from public life expectancy, average wage 
and employment data. The costs incurred in the 3 years after diagnosis were 
assessed. As a comparison, the cost of ACS was also estimated using the same 
study frame. A cost driver analysis was conducted to identify factors impacting 
cancer costs.
RESULTS: The cancers with the highest mean direct medical costs and total costs 
were leukaemia (US$28 464) and oesophageal cancer (US$81 775), respectively. 
Indirect costs accounted for over 50% of the total economic burden of most 
cancers, except for prostate cancer and female breast cancer. The costs of ACS 
were lower than those of most cancers. From the cost driver analysis, older age 
at diagnosis significantly (p<0.05) decreased the total cost of cancer; in 
contrast, male, tumour metastasis, comorbidities and treatment in medical 
centres increased the costs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the comprehensive economic burden of the 
top 10 most costly cancers in Taiwan. These results are valuable for optimising 
healthcare resource allocation.

Is an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure? A cross-sectional study of the 
impact of English public health grant on mortality and morbidity.

OBJECTIVES: The UK government is proposing to cease cutting the local authority 
public health grant by reallocating part of the treatment budget to preventative 
activity. This study examines whether this proposal is evidenced based and, in 
particular, whether these resources are best reallocated to prevention, or 
whether this expenditure would generate more health gains if used for treatment.
METHODS: Instrumental variable regression methods are applied to English local 
authority data on mortality, healthcare and public health expenditure to 
estimate the responsiveness of mortality to variations in healthcare and public 
health expenditure in 2013/14. Using a well-established method, these mortality 
results are converted to a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) basis, and this 
facilitates the estimation of the cost per QALY for both National Health Service 
(NHS) healthcare and local public health expenditure.
RESULTS: Saving lives and improving the quality of life requires resources. Our 
estimates suggest that each additional QALY costs about £3800 from the local 
public health budget, and that each additional QALY from the NHS budget costs 
about £13 500. These estimates can be used to calculate the number of QALYs 
generated by a budget boost. If we err on the side of caution and use the most 
conservative estimates that we have, then an additional £1 billion spent on 
public health will generate 206 398 QALYs (95% CI 36 591 to 3 76 205 QALYs), and 
an additional £1 billion spent on healthcare will generate 67 060 QALYs (95% CI 
21 487 to 112 633 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Additional public health expenditure is very productive of health 
and is more productive than additional NHS expenditure. However, both types of 
expenditure are more productive of health than the norms used by National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (£20 000-£30 000 per QALY) to judge 
whether new therapeutic technologies are suitable for adoption by the NHS.

OBJECTIVES: Abdominal aortic aneurysms with a wide proximal neck (>32 mm) are a 
contraindication for the use of conventional abdominal endovascular stent grafts 
because of their limited maximum proximal diameter (36 mm). In these cases, it 
is customary to resort to sophisticated techniques such as parallel or 
fenestrated grafts. In very selected cases, such as symptomatic wide neck 
aneurysm or patient with limited life expectancy, Funnel Technique may find an 
indication.
METHODS: It consists in placing a bifurcated endograft in the abdominal aorta 
embricated with a thoracic endograft as a proximal cuff in an infrarenal 
position.
RESULTS: In the literature review, we found 32 cases of this technique, whose 
characteristics are collected in a table.
CONCLUSION: The Funnel Technique, taking advantage of the larger diameters of 
the thoracic prostheses, may easily treat abdominal aortic aneurysm cases with a 
wide neck.

Not only does Japan has the world's longest healthy life expectancy, but also 
the world's longest average life span. This study investigated the effect of a 
novel dual-task (DT) exercise called "Synapsology" (SYNAP), developed as a 
game-like activity to improve older adults' physical and cognitive functions. 
Participants (n=24) with a mean age of 70.6 years (65-77 years) were randomly 
assigned to the SYNAP exercise group (SG, n=15) and the control group (CG, n=9). 
The SG participated in the DT intervention consisting of 60-minute sessions, 
twice a week, for 8 weeks. Physical function in timed-up-and-go had significant 
pre- and post- trial differences (P=0.017) in SG. In addition, cognitive 
function results in the a 25-hole trail-making peg test (P=0.004) and an 
oxidative stress marker (P=0.039) had a statistically significant difference 
within the SG. However, there were no significant differences in the physical 
and cognitive functions between SG and CG. In the study, older adults who 
participated in cognitive-motor DT intervention improved significantly with 
regard to motor ability and cognitive function results. Thus, a game-like DT 
exercise may help maintain the healthy life of older adults compared to no 
intervention.

PURPOSE: Pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies how inherited genetic variations in 
individuals affect drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism. PGx panel 
testing can potentially help improve efficiency and accuracy in individualizing 
therapy. This study compared the cost-effectiveness between preemptive PGx panel 
testing, reactive PGx panel testing and usual care (no testing) in 
cardiovascular disease management.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model from the US payer's perspective 
for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients ≥45 years old, using a short-term 
decision tree and long-term Markov model. The testing panel included the 
following gene-drug pairs: CYP2C19-clopidogrel, CYP2C9/VKORC1-warfarin, and 
SLCO1B1-statins with 30 test-return days. Costs were reported in 2019 US dollars 
and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The 
primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER = ΔCost/ΔQALY), 
assuming 3% discount rate for costs and QALYs. Scenario and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of demographics, risk 
level, and follow-up timeframe.
RESULTS: Preemptive testing was found to be cost-effective compared with usual 
care (ICER $86,227/QALY) at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY 
while reactive testing was not (ICER $148,726/QALY). Sensitivity analyses 
suggested that our cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to longer 
follow-up, and the age group 45-64 years.
CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, preemptive PGx panel testing was 
cost-effective in cardiovascular disease management.

BACKGROUND: Patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, 
genetic neuromuscular disease, do not achieve key motor function milestones 
(e.g., sitting) and have short life expectancy in the absence of treatment. 
Nusinersen is a disease-modifying therapy for patients with SMA.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
nusinersen compared to best supportive care (BSC) in patients diagnosed with 
infantile-onset SMA in the US.
METHODS: A de novo economic model was developed with the following health 
states: "permanent ventilation", "not sitting", "sitting", "walking", and 
"death". Short-term data were sourced from the pivotal clinical trials and 
studies of nusinersen (ENDEAR and SHINE). Motor function milestones achieved at 
the end of follow-up in the clinical trials were assumed to be sustained until 
death. Mortality risks were based on survival modelling of relevant published 
Kaplan-Meier data. Costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analyses were performed from a 
US health care sector perspective. Scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses 
were conducted to assess the robustness of the results to key parameters.
RESULTS: In our base-case analysis, nusinersen treatment achieves greater QALYs 
and more LYs (3.24 and 7.64, respectively) compared with BSC (0.46 QALYs and 
2.40 LYs, respectively), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of 
approximately $1,112,000 and an incremental cost per LY gained of $590,000 for 
nusinersen compared to BSC. The incremental cost effectiveness ratios did not 
fall below $990,000 per QALY gained in scenario and sensitivity analyses. 
Results were most sensitive to the length of survival, background health care 
costs, and utility in the "not sitting" and "sitting" health states.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness of nusinersen from a 
US health care sector perspective exceeded traditional cost-effectiveness 
thresholds. Cost-effectiveness was dependent on assumptions made regarding 
survival, costs, utilities, and whether the motor function milestones were 
sustained over lifetime. Given the relatively short-term effectiveness data 
available for the treatment, a registry to collect long-term data of 
infantile-onset SMA patients is recommended.
