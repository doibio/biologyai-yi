Capsule-based self-healing is increasingly being targeted as an effective way to 
improve the durability and sustainability of concrete infrastructures through 
the extension of their service life. Assessing the mechanical and durability 
behaviour of self-healing materials after damage and subsequent autonomous 
repair is essential to validate their possible use in real structures. In this 
study, self-healing mortars containing cementitious tubular capsules with a 
polyurethanic repairing agent were experimentally investigated. Their mechanical 
behaviour under both static and cyclic loading was analysed as a function of 
some factors related to the capsules themselves (production method, waterproof 
coating configuration, volume of repairing agent stored) or to the specimens 
(number, size and distribution of the capsules in the specimen). Their 
mechanical performances were quantified in terms of recovery of load-bearing 
capacity under static conditions and number of cycles to failure as a function 
of the peak force under cyclic conditions. Positive results were achieved, with 
a maximum load recovery index up to more than 40% and number of cycles to 
failure exceeding 10,000 in most cases, with peak force applied during cyclic 
loading at least corresponding to 70% of the estimated load-bearing capacity of 
the healed samples.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of naldemedine (a peripherally acting 
µ-opioid receptor antagonist) for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in subjects 
with cancer was demonstrated in the primary report of a phase III, double-blind 
study (COMPOSE-4) and its open-label extension (COMPOSE-5). The primary end 
point, the proportion of spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) responders, was met. 
Here, we report results from secondary end points, including quality of life 
(QOL) assessments from these studies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In COMPOSE-4, eligible adults with OIC and cancer were 
randomly assigned 1:1 to receive once-daily oral naldemedine 0.2 mg (n = 97) or 
placebo (n = 96) for 2 weeks, and those who continued on to COMPOSE-5 received 
naldemedine for 12 weeks (n = 131). Secondary assessments in COMPOSE-4 included 
the proportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, SBM or CSBM responders by 
week, and subjects with ≥1 SBM or CSBM within 24 h postinitial dose. Changes 
from baseline in the frequency of SBMs or CSBMs per week were assessed at weeks 
1 and 2. Time to the first SBM or CSBM postinitial dose was also evaluated. In 
both studies, QOL impact was evaluated by Patient Assessment of 
Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and PAC-QOL questionnaires.
RESULTS: Naldemedine improved bowel function for all secondary efficacy 
assessments versus placebo (all P ≤ 0.0002). The timely onset of naldemedine 
activity versus placebo was evidenced by median time to the first SBM (4.7 h 
versus 26.6 h) and CSBM (24.0 h versus 218.5 h) postinitial dose (all P < 
0.0001). In COMPOSE-4, significant differences between groups were observed with 
the PAC-SYM stool domain (P = 0.045) and PAC-QOL dissatisfaction domain (P = 
0.015). In COMPOSE-5, significant improvements from baseline were observed for 
overall and individual domain scores of PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Naldemedine provided effective and timely symptomatic relief from 
OIC and improved the QOL of subjects with OIC and cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION ID:

BACKGROUND: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is associated with stroke 
incidence and mortality. However, the global distribution and trends of stroke 
burden and mortality attributable to PM2.5 are rarely studied. We estimated the 
spatial patterns and temporal trends of PM2.5-attributable stroke burden in 195 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: Detailed data on stroke burden attributable to PM2.5 were extracted 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017. The numbers and 
age-standardized rates of stroke disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
mortality (ASDR and ASMR) were estimated by age, sex, subtype, region, and 
country. Temporal trends in ASDR and ASMR were analyzed using estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC).
RESULTS: Globally, in 2017, 10.5 million DALYs and 0.4 million deaths related to 
stroke were attributable to PM2.5. The corresponding ASDR and ASMR increased 
with age, were highest in males and for intracerebral hemorrhage, and varied 
greatly across countries, with the largest burden in high-middle 
sociodemographic index (SDI) regions and East Asia. The global ASDR and ASMR 
decreased by 7.2% and 12.2% from 1990 to 2017, with EAPCs of -0.42 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: -0.55, -0.28) and -0.57 (95% CI: -0.72, -0.42), 
respectively. Age-specific stroke burden rates declined significantly, except in 
the middle-aged population. The decrease was more pronounced in women and for 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, while proportions of ischemic stroke burden increased 
globally and in all SDI regions. Most geographic regions achieved significant 
declines in ASDR and ASMR since 1990; however, Asia and approximately 30% of 
countries and territories, especially in low-income countries, showed 
undesirable increasing trends.
CONCLUSIONS: The patterns and trends were heterogeneous across countries. 
Strengthened and tailored approaches for stroke prevention and air pollution 
management are still needed to reduce the disease burden associated with PM2.5, 
particularly in males, middle-age populations, and low-income countries and for 
ischemic stroke.

The aim of this study was to identify the economic screening strategies for 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in high-risk regions. We used a 
validated ESCC health policy model for comparing different screening strategies 
for ESCC. Strategies varied in terms of age at initiation and frequency of 
screening. Model inputs were derived from parameter calibration and published 
literature. We estimated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of ESCC, 
costs, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Compared with no screening, all competing screening strategies 
decreased the incidence of ESCC from 0.35% to 72.8%, and augmented the number of 
QALYs (0.002-0.086 QALYs per person) over a lifetime horizon. The screening 
strategies initiating at 40 years of age and repeated every 1-3 years, which 
gained over 70% of probabilities that was preferred in probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis at a $1,151/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. Results were sensitive 
to the parameters related to the risks of developing basal cell hyperplasia/mild 
dysplasia. Endoscopy screening initiating at 40 years of age and repeated every 
1-3 years could substantially reduce the disease burden and is cost-effective 
for the general population in high-risk regions.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool to inform individuals and general practitioners 
about benefits of lifestyle changes by providing estimates of the expected age 
of death (EAD) for different risk factor values, and for those who plan and 
decide on preventive activities and health services at population level, to 
calculate potential need for these.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study to estimate EAD using a model with 27 
established risk factors, categorised into four groups: (1) sociodemographic 
background and medical history, (2) lifestyles, (3) life satisfaction, and (4) 
biological risk factors. We apply a Poisson regression model on the survival 
data split into 1-year intervals.
PARTICIPANTS: Total of 38 549 participants aged 25-74 years at baseline of the 
National FINRISK Study between 1987 and 2007.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Register-based comprehensive mortality data from 1987 
to 2014 with an average follow-up time of 16 years and 4310 deaths.
RESULTS: Almost all risk factors included in the model were statistically 
significantly associated with death. The largest influence on the EAD appeared 
to be a current heavy smoker versus a never smoker as the EAD for a 30-year-old 
man decreased from 86.8 years, which corresponds to the reference values of the 
risk factors, to 80.2 years. Diabetes decreased EAD by >6.6 years. Whole or full 
milk consumers had 3.4 years lower EAD compared with those consuming skimmed 
milk. Physically inactive men had 2.4 years lower EAD than those with high 
activity. Men who found their life almost unbearable due to stress had 2.8 years 
lower EAD.
CONCLUSIONS: The biological risk factors and lifestyles, and the factors 
connected with life satisfaction were clearly associated with EAD. Our model for 
estimating a person's EAD can be used to motivate lifestyle changes.

Regular aerobic physical exercise of moderate intensity is undeniably associated 
with improved health and increased longevity, with some studies suggesting that 
more is better. Endurance athletes exceed the usual recommendations for exercise 
by 15-fold to 20-fold. The need to sustain a large cardiac output for prolonged 
periods is associated with a 10-20% increase in left and right ventricular size 
and a substantial increase in left ventricular mass. A large proportion of 
endurance athletes have raised levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponins and 
B-type natriuretic peptide) and cardiac dysfunction for 24-48 h after events, 
but what is the relevance of these findings? In the longer term, some endurance 
athletes have an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, myocardial 
fibrosis and arrhythmias. The inherent association between these 
'maladaptations' and sudden cardiac death in the general population raises the 
question of whether endurance exercise could be detrimental for some 
individuals. However, despite speculation that these abnormalities confer an 
increased risk of future adverse events, elite endurance athletes have an 
increased life expectancy compared with the general population.

BACKGROUND: The appropriate interval of post-treatment follow-up appointments 
for uterine cervical cancer is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the impact of reducing the frequency of post-treatment follow-up examinations on 
life expectancy and medical expenses in cervical cancer patients.
METHODS: Cervical cancer patients who were treated with radiotherapy between 
2008 and 2017, underwent a less frequent follow-up program, and subsequently 
developed recurrent disease were included in consecutive group (CG). 
Non-randomized groups of cervical cancer patients who underwent a frequent 
follow-up program after radiotherapy between 1997 and 2007, and subsequently 
developed recurrent disease were also identified through a chart review and 
served as a comparison group (primary group [PG]). Clinical data regarding the 
primary disease, follow-up, recurrence, and survival were collected. Univariate 
and multivariate analyses of predictors of survival were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 263 recurrent cervical cancer patients (PG: 154, CG: 109) 
were included in the current study. A reduction in follow-up frequency of up to 
40% did not increase the frequency of symptomatic recurrence (PG: vs. CG: 31.2% 
vs. 35.8%, p = 0.43) or reduce the median overall survival periods of recurrent 
cervical cancer patients (PG vs. CG: 32 months vs. 36 months, p = 0.15). 
However, the reduction in the follow-up frequency significantly reduced 
follow-up costs.
CONCLUSION: Reducing the frequency of follow-up by up to 40% did not result in 
shorter overall survival compared with a conventional follow-up program. The 
results of this study provide a rationale for future studies investigating the 
optimal follow-up schedule for patients with cervical cancer.

The development of gene-editing technologies, such as the clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease 
(CRISPR/Cas9) system, coincides with a rapidly expanding knowledge of the role 
of genes in the human ageing process. This raises the prospect that, in addition 
to the treatment of genetic diseases and disorders, it may become possible to 
use gene-editing technologies to alter the ageing process and significantly 
extend the maximum human lifespan. Germline editing poses distinctive problems 
due to its implications for individual members of future, unborn generations. In 
this essay, I wish to home in, narrowly, on a single ethical objection to 
extending the lifespan of future generations by editing the human germline. The 
objection suggests that to extend lifespans is to unethically inflict the harm 
of loneliness on future people. I claim that the argument rests on assumptions 
that ought to be rejected.

OBJECTIVES: ACCURATE, a randomized controlled trial, compared safety and 
effectiveness of stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) vs. conventional 
spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS-I and II) 
of the lower extremities. This analysis compares cost-effectiveness of three 
modalities of treatment for CRPS, namely DRG stimulation, SCS, and comprehensive 
medical management (CMM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective cost-utility analysis combined ACCURATE 
study data with claims data to compare cost-effectiveness between DRG 
stimulation, SCS, and CMM. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov 
cohort model with ten-year time horizon from the U.S. payer perspective. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was reported as cost in 2017 U.S. 
dollars per gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY were used to define highly 
cost-effective and cost-effective therapies.
RESULTS: Both DRG and SCS provided an increase in QALYs (4.96 ± 1.54 and 
4.58 ± 1.35 QALYs, respectively) and an increase in costs ($153,992 ± $36,651 
and $128,269 ± $27,771, respectively) compared to CMM (3.58 ± 0.91 QALYs, 
$106,173 ± $27,005) over the ten-year model lifetime. Both DRG stimulation 
($34,695 per QALY) and SCS ($22,084 per QALY) were cost-effective compared to 
CMM. In the base case, ICER for DRG v SCS was $68,095/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: DRG and SCS are cost-effective treatments for chronic pain 
secondary to CRPS-I and II compared to CMM. DRG accrued higher cost due to 
higher conversion from trial to permanent implant and shorter battery life, but 
DRG was the most beneficial therapy due to more patients receiving permanent 
implants and experiencing higher quality of life compared to SCS. New DRG 
technology has improved battery life, which we expect to make DRG more 
cost-effective compared to both CMM and SCS in the future.

CFTR Modulators: The Changing Face of Cystic Fibrosis in the Era of Precision 
Medicine.

Lopes-Pacheco M(1).

Author information:

of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which result in impairment of 
CFTR mRNA and protein expression, function, stability or a combination of these. 
Although CF leads to multifaceted clinical manifestations, the respiratory 
disorder represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality of these 
patients. The life expectancy of CF patients has substantially lengthened due to 
early diagnosis and improvements in symptomatic therapeutic regimens. Quality of 
life remains nevertheless limited, as these individuals are subjected to 
considerable clinical, psychosocial and economic burdens. Since the discovery of 
the CFTR gene in 1989, tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapies 
acting more upstream on the pathogenesis cascade, thereby overcoming the 
underlying dysfunctions caused by CFTR mutations. In this line, the advances in 
cell-based high-throughput screenings have been facilitating the fast-tracking 
of CFTR modulators. These modulator drugs have the ability to enhance or even 
restore the functional expression of specific CF-causing mutations, and they 
have been classified into five main groups depending on their effects on CFTR 
mutations: potentiators, correctors, stabilizers, read-through agents, and 
amplifiers. To date, four CFTR modulators have reached the market, and these 
pharmaceutical therapies are transforming patients' lives with short- and 
long-term improvements in clinical outcomes. Such breakthroughs have paved the 
way for the development of novel CFTR modulators, which are currently under 
experimental and clinical investigations. Furthermore, recent insights into the 
CFTR structure will be useful for the rational design of next-generation 
modulator drugs. This review aims to provide a summary of recent developments in 
CFTR-directed therapeutics. Barriers and future directions are also discussed in 
order to optimize treatment adherence, identify feasible and sustainable 
solutions for equitable access to these therapies, and continue to expand the 
pipeline of novel modulators that may result in effective precision medicine for 
all individuals with CF.

Giant intracranial aneurysms (ICGA) represent 3 to 5% of all intracranial 
aneurysms in adults. They are defined as arterial dilatations, with more than 25 
mm in diameter. Despite important advances in the research of endovascular 
techniques of treating giant intracranial aneurysms, the management of these 
vascular malformations still poses great difficulties for neurologists and 
interventional radiologists. In particular, these challenges arise from the 
difficult and modified cerebral anatomy of patients with ICGA. Choosing the best 
treatment for patients with ICGA involves not only finding the perfect balance 
between the potential risks and benefits of endovascular treatment, but also 
taking into consideration the patient's biological condition and associated 
diseases. The aim of this paper is to describe the decisional algorithm of 
treating patients with giant intracranial aneurysms and factors which could 
influence the choice of endovascular technique. We report a clinical case of a 
63-year-old female with cardio-vascular risk factors (atrial fibrillation, high 
blood pressure), diagnosed with a symptomatic giant aneurysm of the right 
internal carotid artery and multiple cerebral micro-bleeds. Given the very large 
size of the aneurysm, its characteristics as well as patient's associated 
comorbidities, it was decided to exclude the ICA aneurysm from circulation by 
occluding the parent vessel (right internal carotid artery) by using 
endovascular techniques. Also, a review of the literature on the currently 
available endovascular methods for treating patients with giant intracranial 
aneurysms was performed in order to see the indications and possible long-term 
complications of each method. In selected cases, the risks of serious 
complications associated with occluding a large cervical-cerebral vessel (as the 
internal carotid artery) are far exceeded by the risk for rupture of giant 
aneurysms, which is fatal in many cases. Nevertheless, it is of utmost 
importance to mention that, although the use of endovascular methods leads to a 
significant increase in life expectancy, a severe decline in quality of life 
might be experienced by these patients.

A 31-year-old female with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome and two recent 
miscarriages presented with symptoms of a transient ischemic attack. 
Echocardiography to assess for possible embolic source identified a 4.8 cm left 
atrial mass, presumed to be an atrial myxoma. At surgery the tumor was 
suspicious of malignancy. Histopathology revealed a heterogeneous hyper- and 
hypo-cellular spindle cell tumor showing mild atypia. Atrial myxoma markers were 
negative. The Ki67 proliferation factor was 30% and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) analysis showed MDM2 amplification. Expert review confirmed 
the morphological, immunohistochemical, and FISH features to be of a cardiac 
intimal sarcoma. Recent improvements in imaging, surgery, and molecular testing 
have increased diagnoses of primary cardiac intimal sarcomas. Here we discuss 
the pathological and clinical implications of these rare atrial myxoma mimics. 
<Learning objective: Intimal sarcomas are rare, aggressive tumors typically 
associated with great vessels, however, molecular diagnoses of cardiac intimal 
sarcomas are increasing. Presentation is varied. Cardiac symptoms and emboli in 
young patients should prompt investigation with high levels of suspicion. 
Intimal sarcomas show MDM2 amplification with genetic aberration. Careful 
pre-operative planning to achieve clear surgical margins almost doubles life 
expectancy. Chemoradiotherapy may be beneficial. MDM2 and PDGFRa inhibitors are 
in development.>.

Cancer diagnostics and therapies have improved steadily over the last few 
decades, markedly increasing life expectancy for patients at all ages. However, 
conventional and newer anti-neoplastic therapies can cause short- and long-term 
cardiotoxicity. The clinical implications of this cardiotoxicity become more 
important with the increasing use of cardiotoxic drugs. The implications are 
especially serious among patients predisposed to adverse cardiac effects, such 
as youth, the elderly, those with cardiovascular comorbidities, and those 
receiving additional chemotherapies or thoracic radiation. However, the optimal 
strategy for preventing and managing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity remains 
unknown. The routine use of neurohormonal antagonists for cardioprotection is 
not currently justified, given the marginal benefits and associated adverse 
events, particularly with long-term use. The only United States Food and Drug 
Administration and European Medicines Agency approved treatment for preventing 
anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy is dexrazoxane. We advocate administering 
dexrazoxane during cancer treatment to limit the cardiotoxic effects of 
anthracycline chemotherapy.

This study investigates the asymmetric effects of business cycles (measured by 
real GDP per capita) on population health (measured by life expectancy at birth) 
from the ASEAN countries, namely, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, 
Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The panel vector error 
correction model, together with various panel unit root tests and cointegration 
tests, suggested a hidden cointegrated relationship between life expectancy at 
birth and the positive and negative components of real GDP per capita, and the 
asymmetric effects of business cycles on population health were identified in 
both in the short run and in the long run. Policymakers should focus on the 
harmful effects of business cycles on population health, and government 
interventions should be more forceful in times of economic expansion than during 
periods of economic recession.

Autoantibody signatures of circulating mucin fragments stem from cancer tissues, 
and microenvironments are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy. 
This study highlights dynamic epitopes generated by aberrantly truncated 
immature O-glycosylation at consecutive threonine motifs (TTX) found in mucins 
and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). NMR analysis of synthetic mucin 
models having glycosylated TTX motifs and colonic MUC2 tandem repeats (TRs) 
containing TTP and TTL moieties unveils a general principle that O-glycosylation 
at TTX motifs generates a highly extended and rigid conformation in IDPs. We 
demonstrate that the specific conformation of glycosylated TTX motifs in MUC2 
TRs is rationally rearranged by concerted motions of multiple dihedral angles 
and noncovalent interactions between the carbohydrate and peptide region. 
Importantly, this canonical conformation of glycosylated TTX motifs minimizes 
steric crowding of glycans attached to threonine residues, in which O-glycans 
possess restricted orientations permitting further sugar extension. An 
antiadhesive microarray displaying synthetic MUC2 derivatives elicited the 
presence of natural autoantibodies to MUC2 with impaired O-glycosylation at TTX 
motifs in sera of healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with early stage 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Interestingly, autoantibody levels in sera of the late 
stage CRC patients were distinctly lower than those of early stage CRC and 
normal individuals, indicating that the anti-MUC2 humoral response to MUC2 
neoepitopes correlates inversely with the CRC stage of patients. Our results 
uncovered the structural basis of the creation of dynamic epitopes by immature 
O-glycosylation at TTX motifs in mucins that facilitates the identification of 
high-potential targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

China is facing serious population aging issues because of many unintended 
consequences of the economic reforms that began in the 1980s and with social 
policies such as the "one child" policy. Understanding the spatial distribution 
of the health status of older people has attracted more and more attention in 
many countries, including China. By employing descriptive analysis, this study 
uses data from the Chinese Population Censusand Statistical Year Bookto explore 
the health inequalities of older people at the national level. Based on the 
Getis-Ord Gi*, this study finds that the uneven spatial distribution of 
socio-economic status results in health inequalities for older people at the 
national level. The geographic distribution of life expectancy was correlated 
with a number of important demographic, socio-economic, and environmental 
variables. For further research, investigations should be conducted among 
individuals at micro-geographic scales.

Background Right ventricular myocardial fatty infiltration has been observed in 
pediatric cardiac allografts with an associated decrease in graft life 
expectancy. A possible explanation included an immunosuppressant drug effect 
which prompted us to examine common factors between non-cardiac transplanted 
immunosuppressed patients and postmortem hearts of pediatric patients who died 
of non-cardiac causes.Materials and Methods Sixty-one of 1,030 pediatric 
autopsies were from immunosuppressed children who were treated with 
corticosteroids for malignant tumors, non-cardiac transplantations, or other 
chronic clinical conditions. 62 children who died for non-medical reasons served 
as controls. Cardiac H&E autopsy slides were examined for right ventricular 
fatty infiltration.Results There was a significant increase in right ventricular 
fatty infiltration in patients that were non-cardiac transplanted and 
immunosuppressed compared to controls. None of the index patients had other 
features of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.Conclusions 
Immunosuppression may lead to right ventricular fatty infiltration in childhood.

Therapeutic hypothermia in severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: a 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is 0.5 per 
1,000 live births. Current standard treatment is therapeutic hypothermia 
(cooling) begun within 6 hours of life. In infants with severe HIE, this results 
in fewer deaths; however, more infants survive with major neurodevelopmental 
disability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether cooling is cost-effective compared to 
no cooling in cases of severe HIE, and to compare it to the cost-effectiveness 
of cooling in cases of moderate HIE.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model using TreeAge Pro (2020) software was 
designed comparing cooling to no cooling in a cohort of 5,800 term neonates with 
HIE. Model inputs were derived from the literature. Utilities were applied to 
life expectancy to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). All costs and 
QALYs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The strategy was considered 
cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Cooling for the management of severe HIE resulted in increased costs 
and increased QALYs, with an ICER of 6,864. In our theoretical cohort, cooling 
resulted in 835 fewer neonatal deaths, but 52 additional cases of severe 
neurological disability with cooling due to increased survival. When varying the 
probability of a healthy child with cooling in univariate sensitivity analysis, 
cooling was found to be the cost-effective strategy across all ranges and the 
dominant (lower costs, higher QALYs) strategy above 68% (baseline estimate: 
63%). Multivariate sensitivity analysis found cooling was the cost-effective 
strategy 99.7% of the time.
CONCLUSION: Cooling is the cost-effective intervention with improved outcomes 
for neonates with severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy over a wide 
range of assumptions. Despite the increased cost, more neonates survive 
morbidity free when compared with no cooling.

Brachial plexus injuries will cause a significantly decreased quality of life. 
Patients with upper arm type brachial plexus injuries, which means C5 and C6 
roots injury, will lose their shoulder elevation/abduction/external rotation, 
and elbow flexion function. Additional elbow, wrist, and hand extension function 
deficit will occur in patients with C7 root injury. With the advances of 
reconstructive procedures, the upper arm brachial plexus injuries can be 
successfully restored through nerve repair, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, 
muscle / tendon transfer and free functioning muscle transfer. In this review 
article, we summarized the various reconstructive procedures to restore the 
function of shoulder and elbow. Nowadays, the upper arm type BPI can be treat 
with satisfied outcomes (80-90% successful rate).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study.
INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brachial plexus injuries (BPIs) can be devastating and 
negatively impact daily function and quality of life. Occupational therapists 
play an important role in rehabilitation; however, studies identifying outcomes 
are lacking.
PURPOSE: This study aims to describe outcomes including motor recovery, upper 
limb function, participation, pain, and quality of life for people receiving 
occupational therapy intervention.
METHODS: A convenience sample of English-speaking adults (n = 30) with a 
traumatic BPI, attending the clinic between December 1, 2014, to November 30, 
2016, participated. Participants received occupational therapy focusing on 
sensorimotor retraining and activity-based rehabilitation. Data on active range 
of motion (goniometry), strength (Medical Research Council (MRC)), upper-limb 
function (UEFI15, QuickDASH), participation (PSFS), pain (Brief Pain Inventory), 
and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months.
RESULTS: Elbow flexion strength showed significant improvement at all 
time-points, average increase 2.17 (MRC) (95% confidence interval: 1.29-3.04; 
P < .001) and mean final MRC grading 3.86 (standard error: 0.44). Significant 
improvements at 12 months were seen in: shoulder abduction strength and range, 
flexion strength and range, external rotation range; elbow extension strength 
and flexion range; thumb flexion and extension strength. Upper limb function 
(QuickDASH) showed significant improvement (mean change = 18.85; 95% confidence 
interval: 4.12-33.59; P = .02). Forearm protonation range and finger flexion 
strength were significantly worse. Remaining outcomes did not show significant 
improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational therapy with surgical intervention can improve 
strength, range, and upper limb function with people following traumatic BPI. 
Further investigations into impact on participation, pain, and quality of life 
are required.

Increased life expectancy rates in people with a stoma prompt the need to gain a 
better understanding of what are the concerns and the strategies of adaptation 
in this population in the long term to provide appropriate guidance and ongoing 
care. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the experiences and 
perceptions of people living with a colostomy for at least 20 years with regard 
to body changes and how these influence stoma care. This is phenomenological 
study. Five main themes were identified following data analyses: 1) accepting 
the stoma and living one's life almost fully; 2) changes; 3) practices to which 
I owe the recovery of my autonomy; 4) we are in need: before, during and after; 
5) most people don't know. After many years, interviewees did not report 
significant changes in the way they had to manage their stoma and activities of 
daily living. Participants underlined how their healthcare needs continue 
throughout their lives, thus outlining the key role they attribute to nurses, 
stoma therapy services and associations of people with a stoma.

BACKGROUND: Carcinoid syndrome, a rare condition in patients with neuroendocrine 
tumours, characterised by flushing and diarrhoea, severely affects patients' 
quality of life. The current carcinoid syndrome standard of care includes 
somatostatin analogues, but some patients experience uncontrolled symptoms 
despite somatostatin analogue therapy. Telotristat ethyl is a novel treatment 
approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US FDA that significantly 
reduces bowel movement frequency in patients with uncontrolled carcinoid 
syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: We developed a model to evaluate the 5-year budget impact of 
introducing telotristat ethyl to standard care in Swedish patients with 
uncontrolled carcinoid syndrome.
METHODS: Treatment response in the 12-week phase III TELESTAR trial
