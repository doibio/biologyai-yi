Type 2 diabetes is responsible for approximately 90% of all diabetes worldwide 
and it is a global public health problem. This is a chronic, progressive, 
metabolic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia, which leads to 
microangiopathic and macroangiopathic complications. Subjects with type 2 
diabetes have increased mortality and a reduced life expectancy compared with 
those without diabetes. Strong evidence supports the fact that identification of 
type 2 diabetes risk factors and early intervention influencing the modifiable 
ones can reduce incidence rate of diabetes and prevalence of its complications. 
There are many advantages of such interventions for patients (prolonged life 
expectancy, improvement of life quality) and for the whole society (reduction of 
the costs). Therefore the guidelines for the prevention of type 2 diabetes are 
needed. Experts of the Polish Cardiac Society Working Group on Cardiovascular 
Pharmacotherapy reviewed recently published clinical studies regarding the 
prevention of type 2 diabetes and prepared their recommendations. The guidelines 
are designed to assist clinicians and other healthcare workers to make evidence 
based management decisions. The strategies are grouped broadly into 
interventions that aim to change lifestyle through physical activity and diet, 
interventions based on drug administration (pharmacotherapy) and surgical 
interventions.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiologic factors have generated increased demand for 
liver transplantation among older patients. We aimed to describe trends in age 
among liver transplant registrants and recipients and the effect of age on 
waitlist and post-transplantation outcomes and on transplant-related survival 
benefit.
METHODS: We obtained data from the United Network for Organ Sharing on adults 
who were listed for liver transplantation (N = 122,606) or underwent liver 
transplantation (N = 60,820) from 2002 to 2014 in the United States. Competing 
risks analysis was used to model waitlist outcomes and Cox proportional hazards 
analysis to model post-transplantation survival. These models were also used to 
estimate 5-year transplant-related survival benefit for different age groups, 
calculated as the difference between waitlist and post-transplantation life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2014, the mean age of liver transplant registrants 
increased from 51.2 to 55.7 years, with a more prominent increase in hepatitis C 
virus-positive (50.9-57.9 years) than hepatitis C virus-negative (51.3-54.3 
years) registrants. The proportion of registrants aged ≥60 years increased from 
19% to 41%. In hepatitis C virus-negative patients, aging trends were driven by 
increasing proportions of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis. Among transplant registrants, increasing age was associated 
with increasing mortality before transplantation and decreasing likelihood of 
transplantation. Among transplant recipients, increasing age was associated with 
increasing post-transplantation mortality. There was little difference in 5-year 
transplant-related survival benefit between different age groups who had the 
same Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score.
CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic aging of liver transplant registrants and recipients 
occurred from 2002 to 2014, driven by aging of the hepatitis C virus-positive 
cohort and increased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Increasing age does not affect transplant-related 
survival benefit substantially because age diminishes both post-transplantation 
survival and waitlist survival approximately equally.

comprehensive care of cystinosis.

[Article in English, Spanish]

INTRODUCTION: Cystinosis is a rare lysosomal systemic disease that mainly 
affects the kidney and the eye. Patients with cystinosis begin renal replacement 
therapy during the first decade of life in absence of treatment. Prognosis of 
cystinosis depends on early diagnosis, and prompt starting and good compliance 
with cysteamine treatment. Kidney disease progression, extra-renal complications 
and shorter life expectancy are more pronounced in those patients that do not 
follow treatment. The objective of this work was to elaborate recommendations 
for the comprehensive care of cystinosis and the facilitation of patient 
transition from paediatric to adult treatment, based on clinical experience. The 
goal is to reduce the impact of the disease, and to improve patient quality of 
life and prognosis.
METHODS: Bibliographic research and consensus meetings among a multidisciplinary 
professional team of experts in the clinical practice, with cystinotic patients 
(T-CiS.bcn group) from 5 hospitals located in Barcelona.
RESULTS: This document gathers specific recommendations for diagnosis, treatment 
and multidisciplinary follow-up of cystinotic patients in the following areas: 
nephrology, dialysis,renal transplant, ophthalmology, endocrinology, neurology, 
laboratory, genetic counselling,nursing and pharmacy.
CONCLUSIONS: A reference document for the comprehensive care of cystinosis 
represents a support tool for health professionals who take care of these 
patients. It is based on the following main pillars: (a) a multi-disciplinary 
approach, (b) appropriate disease monitoring and control of intracellular 
cystine levels in leukocytes, (c) the importance of adherence to treatment with 
cysteamine, and (d) the promotion of patient self-care by means of disease 
education programmes. All these recommendations will lead us, in a second phase, 
to create a coordinated transition model between paediatric and adult care 
services which will contemplate the specific needs of cystinosis.

BACKGROUND: The moth orchid (Phalaenopsis species) is an ornamental crop that is 
highly commercialized worldwide. Over 30,000 cultivars of moth orchids have been 
registered at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). These cultivars were 
obtained by artificial pollination of interspecific hybridization. Therefore, 
the identification of different cultivars is highly important in the worldwide 
market.
METHODS/RESULTS: We used Illumina sequencing technology to analyze an important 
species for breeding, Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana and develop the 
expressed sequence tag (EST)-simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. After de novo 
assembly, the obtained sequence covered 29.1 Mb, approximately 2.2% of the P. 
aphrodite subsp. formosana genome (1,300 Mb), and a total of 1,439 EST-SSR loci 
were detected. SSR occurs in the exon region, including the 5' untranslated 
region (UTR), coding region (CDS), and 3'UTR, on average every 20.22 kb. The di- 
and tri-nucleotide motifs (51.49% and 35.23%, respectively) were the two most 
frequent motifs in the P. aphrodite subsp. formosana. To validate the developed 
EST-SSR loci and to evaluate the transferability to the genus Phalaenopsis, 
thirty tri-nucleotide motifs of the EST-SSR loci were randomly selected to 
design EST-SSR primers and to evaluate the polymorphism and transferability 
across 22 native Phalaenopsis species that are usually used as parents for moth 
orchid breeding. Of the 30 EST-SSR loci, ten polymorphic and transferable SSR 
loci across the 22 native taxa can be obtained. The validated EST-SSR markers 
were further proven to discriminate 12 closely related Phalaenopsis cultivars. 
The results show that it is not difficult to obtain universal SSR markers by 
transcriptome deep sequencing in Phalaenopsis species.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supported that transcriptome analysis based on deep 
sequencing is a powerful tool to develop SSR loci in non-model species. A large 
number of EST-SSR loci can be isolated, and about 33.33% EST-SSR loci are 
universal markers across the Phalaenopsis breeding germplasm after preliminary 
validation. The potential universal EST-SSR markers are highly valuable for 
identifying all of Phalaenopsis cultivars.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the lifetime and phase-specific cost of anal cancer 
management and the economic burden of anal cancer care in elderly (66 y and 
older) patients in the United States.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this study, we used Surveillance Epidemiology and End 
Results-Medicare linked database (1992 to 2009). We matched newly diagnosed anal 
cancer patients (by age and sex) to noncancer controls. We estimated survival 
time from the date of diagnosis until death. Lifetime and average annual cost by 
stage and age at diagnosis were estimated by combining survival data with 
Medicare claims. The average lifetime cost, proportion of patients who were 
elderly, and the number of incident cases were used to estimate the economic 
burden.
RESULTS: The average lifetime cost for patients with anal cancer was US$50,150 
(N=2227) (2014 US dollars). The average annual cost in men and women was US$8025 
and US$5124, respectively. The overall survival after the diagnosis of cancer 
was 8.42 years. As the age and stage at diagnosis increased, so did the cost of 
cancer-related care. The anal cancer-related lifetime economic burden in 
Medicare patients in the United States was US$112 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of anal cancer among the elderly in the 
United States is small, its economic burden is considerable.

Patterns of Mortality in Patients Treated with Dental Implants: A Comparison of 
Patient Age Groups and Corresponding Reference Populations.

Jemt T, Kowar J, Nilsson M, Stenport V.

PURPOSE: Little is known about the relationship between implant patient 
mortality compared to reference populations. The aim of this study was to report 
the mortality pattern in patients treated with dental implants up to a 15-year 
period, and to compare this to mortality in reference populations with regard to 
age at surgery, sex, and degree of tooth loss.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient cumulative survival rate (CSR) was calculated for 
a total of 4,231 treated implant patients from a single clinic. Information was 
based on surgical registers in the clinic and the National Population Register 
in Sweden. Patients were arranged into age groups of 10 years, and CSR was 
compared to that of the reference population of comparable age and reported in 
relation to age at surgery, sex, and type of jaw/dentition.
RESULTS: A similar, consistent, general relationship between CSR of different 
age groups of implant patients and reference populations could be observed for 
all parameters studied. Completely edentulous patients presented higher 
mortality than partially edentulous patients (P < .05). Furthermore, implant 
patients in younger age groups showed mortality similar to or higher than 
reference populations, while older patient age groups showed increasingly lower 
mortality than comparable reference populations for edentulous and partially 
edentulous patients (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: A consistent pattern of mortality in different age groups of 
patients compared to reference populations was observed, indicating higher 
patient mortality in younger age groups and lower in older groups. The reported 
pattern is not assumed to be related to implant treatment per se, but is assumed 
to reflect the variation in general health of a selected subgroup of treated 
implant patients compared to the reference population in different age groups.

INTRODUCTION: Global increases in life expectancy are expected to continue, with 
accompanying physical and mental well-being challenges specifically for older 
people living in residential care settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between 
mental well-being and social capital of older residents (60+ years) in an urban 
residential care facility in South Africa.
METHOD: A descriptive survey was conducted with 103 residents living in a 
residential care facility in an urban environment in South Africa. The social 
capital framework from the Canadian Policy Research Initiative, the WHO-5 
well-being index, the Kessler-6 measure of psychosocial distress, the OSLO-3 
Social Support Scale and the Australian Bureau of Statistics Indigenous Health 
Questionnaire were used to develop the questionnaire.
RESULTS: The WHO-5 showed moderate ratings of mental well-being for the standard 
scoring (>13) (62, 82.7%), but lower levels when using 'no negative ratings' 
(36; 50.6%). Significant differences in the primary network size, average 
closeness, self-efficacy and social support as well as the ability to confide in 
primary network was shown between residents with mentally well and unwell 
ratings. Logistic regression showed that the strongest predictor for mental 
well-being was participation in activities outside of the residence and having a 
primary network.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms the association between social capital and mental 
well-being.

IMPORTANCE: Which imaging modality is optimal to select patients for 
endovascular stroke treatment remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of specific magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and clinical criteria in the selection of patients with acute ischemic 
stroke for thrombectomy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this observational, single-center, 
prospective cohort study, we studied 72 patients with middle cerebral artery or 
terminal internal carotid artery occlusion using computed tomographic 
angiography, followed by core infarct volume determination by diffusion weighted 
MRI, who underwent thrombectomy after meeting institutional criteria from 
January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. In this period, 31 patients with 
similar ischemic strokes underwent endovascular treatment without MRI and are 
categorized as computed tomography only and considered in a secondary analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were prospectively classified as likely to benefit (LTB) 
or uncertain to benefit (UTB) using diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volume and 
clinical criteria (age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, time 
from onset, baseline modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score, life expectancy).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 90-day mRS score, with favorable defined as a 
90-day mRS score of 2 or less.
RESULTS: Forty patients were prospectively classified as LTB and 32 as UTB. 
Reperfusion (71 of 103 patients) and prospective categorization as LTB (40 of 
103 patients) were associated with favorable outcomes (P < .001 and P < .005, 
respectively). Successful reperfusion positively affected the distribution of 
mRS scores of the LTB cohort (P < .001). Reperfusion was achieved in 27 LTB 
patients (67.5%) and 24 UTB patients (75.0%) (P = .86). Favorable outcomes were 
obtained in 21 (52.5%) and 8 (25.0%) of LTB and UTB patients who were treated, 
respectively (P = .02). Favorable outcomes were observed in 20 of the 27 LTB 
patients (74.1%) who had successful reperfusion compared with 8 of the 24 UTB 
patients (33.3%) who had successful reperfusion (P = .004). The ratio of treated 
to screened patients was 1:3.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prospective classification as LTB by MRI and clinical 
criteria is associated with likelihood of favorable outcome after thrombectomy, 
particularly if reperfusion is successful. Selection of patients using MRI 
compares favorably with selection using computed tomographic techniques with the 
distinction that a higher proportion of screened patients were treated.

The hepatitis C revolution part 1: antiviral treatment options.

and the University of Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, Queens Medical 
Centre, Nottingham, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The rapid evolution in the therapeutic landscape of hepatitis 
C presents a minefield to clinicians seeking to optimize therapy for their 
patients. Efficacy, evidence-base, side-effects, and drug combinations must be 
tailored to individual patients, taking into account comorbidities, degree of 
fibrosis, evidence of hepatic decompensation, and life expectancy. The review 
article aims to discuss novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments with an 
overview of recent breakthrough research validating their potential. It is hoped 
that this systematic evaluation will clarify best available evidence for 
clinicians treating patients with HCV on a regular basis.
RECENT FINDINGS: With greater understanding of the HCV life cycle and viral 
genome, the last decade has seen the emergence of novel direct-acting antiviral 
(DAA) agents, which specifically target proteins responsible for viral 
replication. Landmark clinical trials have offered robust evidence supporting 
the use of DAA agents as pioneer treatments, alone, or in combination with 
standard pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV)-based regimens. DAAs 
have proved highly efficacious, with pan-genotypic activity, shortened treatment 
duration, and an improved side-effect profile when compared with historical 
peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Recent phase 3 studies have provided proof-of-concept 
that all-oral, IFN-free DAA regimens can yield high rates of sustained 
virological response across most HCV genotypes.
SUMMARY: The ability of DAAs to dramatically improve virological clearance 
heralds a new era in clinical therapeutics, as the unprecedented prospect of 
cure for a chronic viral infection becomes tangible. However, myriad clinical 
challenges remain before global eradication of HCV can become reality.

BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a slowly progressive condition of the hand, 
characterised by the formation of nodules in the palm that gradually develop 
into fibrotic cords. Contracture of the cords produces deformities of the 
fingers. Surgery is recommended for moderate and severe contractures, but 
complications and/or recurrences are frequent. Collagenase clostridium 
histolyticum (CCH) has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative to 
surgery for some patients.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
collagenase as an alternative to surgery for adults with Dupuytren's contracture 
with a palpable cord.
DATA SOURCES: We searched all major electronic databases from 1990 to February 
2014.
REVIEW METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised comparative 
studies and observational studies involving collagenase and/or surgical 
interventions were considered. Two reviewers independently extracted data and 
assessed risk of bias of included studies. A de novo Markov model was developed 
to assess cost-effectiveness of collagenase, percutaneous needle fasciotomy 
(PNF) and limited fasciectomy (LF). Results were reported as incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate model and parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Five RCTs comparing collagenase with placebo (493 participants), three 
RCTs comparing surgical techniques (334 participants), two non-randomised 
studies comparing collagenase and surgery (105 participants), five 
non-randomised comparative studies assessing various surgical procedures (3571 
participants) and 15 collagenase case series (3154 participants) were included. 
Meta-analyses of RCTs assessing CCH versus placebo were performed. Joints 
randomised to collagenase were more likely to achieve clinical success. 
Collagenase-treated participants experienced significant reduction in 
contracture and an increased range of motion compared with placebo-treated 
participants. Participants treated with collagenase also experienced 
significantly more adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate. Four 
serious adverse events were observed in the collagenase group: two tendon 
ruptures, one pulley rupture and one complex regional pain syndrome. Two tendon 
ruptures were also reported in two collagenase case series. Non-randomised 
studies comparing collagenase with surgery produced variable results and were at 
high risk of bias. Serious adverse events across surgery studies were low. 
Recurrence rates ranged from 0% (at 90 days) to 100% (at 8 years) for 
collagenase and from 0% (at 2.7 years for fasciectomy) to 85% (at 5 years for 
PNF) for surgery. The results of the de novo economic analysis show that PNF was 
the cheapest treatment option, whereas LF generated the greatest QALY gains. 
Collagenase was more costly and generated fewer QALYs compared with LF. LF was 
£1199 more costly and generated an additional 0.11 QALYs in comparison with PNF. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £10,871 per QALY gained. Two 
subgroup analyses were conducted for a population of patients with moderate and 
severe disease and up to two joints affected. In both subgroup analyses, 
collagenase remained dominated.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of the review was the lack of head-to-head RCTs 
comparing collagenase with surgery and the limited evidence base for estimating 
the effects of specific surgical procedures (fasciectomy and PNF). Substantial 
differences across studies further limited the comparability of available 
evidence. The economic model was derived from a naive indirect comparison and 
was hindered by a lack of suitable data. In addition, there was considerable 
uncertainty about the appropriateness of many assumptions and parameters used in 
the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase was significantly better than placebo. There was no 
evidence that collagenase was clinically better or worse than surgical 
treatments. LF was the most cost-effective choice to treat moderate to severe 
contractures, whereas collagenase was not. However, the results of the 
cost-utility analysis are based on a naive indirect comparison of clinical 
effectiveness, and a RCT is required to confirm or refute these findings.

Recently approved, interferon-free medication regimens for treating hepatitis C 
are highly effective, but extremely costly. We aimed to identify cost-effective 
strategies for managing treatment-naïve U.S. veterans with new hepatitis C 
medication regimens. We developed a Markov model with 1-year cycle length for a 
cohort of 60-year-old veterans with untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C seeking 
treatment in a typical year. We compared using sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or 
ombitasvir/ritonavir/paritaprevir/dasabuvir to treat: (1) any patient seeking 
treatment; (2) only patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; or (3) 
patients with advanced disease first and healthier patients 1 year later. The 
previous standard of care, sofosbuvir/simeprevir or sofosbuvir/pegylated 
interferon/ribavirin, was included for comparison. Patients could develop 
progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, undergo 
transplantation, or die. Complications were less likely after sustained 
virological response. We calculated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) and varied model inputs in one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. We used the Veterans Health Administration perspective 
with a lifetime time horizon and 3% annual discounting. Treating any patient 
with ombitasvir-based therapy was the preferred strategy ($35,560; 14.0 QALYs). 
All other strategies were dominated (greater costs/QALY gained than more 
effective strategies). Varying treatment efficacy, price, and/or duration 
changed the preferred strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, treating 
any patient with ombitasvir-based therapy was cost-effective in 70% of 
iterations at a $50,000/QALY threshold and 65% of iterations at a $100,000/QALY 
threshold.
CONCLUSION: Managing any treatment-naïve genotype 1 hepatitis C patient with 
ombitasvir-based therapy is the most economically efficient strategy, although 
price and efficacy can impact cost-effectiveness. It is economically unfavorable 
to restrict treatment to patients with advanced disease or use a staged 
treatment strategy. (Hepatology 2016;63:428-436).

The risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly is significantly higher than in 
young subjects; paradoxically some treatments that have proven their efficacy in 
reducing cardiovascular risk are often under prescribed in this age group. The 
benefits of statins in secondary cardiovascular prevention are well established 
in patients <80 years. In primary prevention, these drugs reduce the risk of 
myocardial infarction and stroke, but their effects on cardiovascular mortality 
remain uncertain. In very elderly patients, there are no randomized trials 
relative to the impact of statins on morbi-mortality in primary prevention as 
well in secondary prevention. Adverse effects in the elderly seem to be 
statistically similar to those occurring in young people , but the prescription 
in very old people should be individualized, taking into account the life 
expectancy, the life quality, the comorbidities, and especially the risk of drug 
interactions.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cost-effectiveness of a psychologist-led, 
individualised cognitive behavioural intervention (PI) to a nurse-led, minimal 
contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and 
carers.
METHODS: This was an economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised trial 
of highly distressed adult cancer patients and carers calling cancer helplines. 
Services used by participants were measured using a resource use questionnaire, 
and quality-adjusted life years were measured using the assessment of quality of 
life - eight-dimension - instrument collected through a computer-assisted 
telephone interview. The base case analysis stratified participants based on the 
baseline score on the Brief Symptom Inventory. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio confidence intervals were calculated with a nonparametric bootstrap to 
reflect sampling uncertainty. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis 
by varying unit costs for resource use and the method for handling missing data.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in overall total costs or 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between intervention groups. Bootstrapped 
data suggest the PI had a higher probability of lower cost and greater QALYs for 
both carers and patients with high distress at baseline. For patients with low 
levels of distress at baseline, the PI had a higher probability of greater QALYs 
but at additional cost. Sensitivity analysis showed the results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The PI may be cost-effective compared with the nurse-led, minimal 
contact self-management condition for highly distressed cancer patients and 
carers. More intensive psychological intervention for patients with greater 
levels of distress appears warranted. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) disease management (COPD-DM) programme in primary care, 
called RECODE, compared to usual care.
DESIGN: A 2-year cluster-randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 40 general practices in the western part of the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 1086 patients with COPD according to GOLD (Global Initiative for 
COPD) criteria. Exclusion criteria were terminal illness, cognitive impairment, 
alcohol or drug misuse and inability to fill in Dutch questionnaires. Practices 
were included if they were willing to create a multidisciplinary COPD team.
INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team of caregivers was trained in 
motivational interviewing, setting up individual care plans, exacerbation 
management, implementing clinical guidelines and redesigning the care process. 
In addition, clinical decision-making was supported by feedback reports provided 
by an ICT programme.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the impact on health outcomes 
(quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), Clinical COPD Questionnaire, St. George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire and exacerbations) and costs (healthcare and societal 
perspective).
RESULTS: The intervention costs were €324 per patient. Excluding these costs, 
the intervention group had €584 (95% CI €86 to €1046) higher healthcare costs 
than did the usual care group and €645 (95% CI €28 to €1190) higher costs from 
the societal perspective. Health outcomes were similar in both groups, except 
for 0.04 (95% CI -0.07 to -0.01) less QALYs in the intervention group.
CONCLUSIONS: This integrated care programme for patients with COPD that mainly 
included professionally directed interventions was not cost-effective in primary 
care.

The success of the current biomedical paradigm based on a "disease model" may be 
limited in the future because of large number of comorbidities inflicting older 
people. In recent years, there has been growing empirical evidence, based on 
animal models, suggesting that the aging process could be delayed and that this 
process may lead to increases in life expectancy accompanied by improvements in 
health at older ages. In this review, we explore past, present, and future 
prospects of healthy life expectancy and examine whether increases in average 
length of life associated with delayed aging link with additional years lived 
disability-free at older ages. Trends in healthy life expectancy suggest 
improvements among older people in the United States, although younger cohorts 
appear to be reaching old age with increasing levels of frailty and disability. 
Trends in health risk factors, such as obesity and smoking, show worrisome signs 
of negative impacts on adult health and mortality in the near future. However, 
results based on a simulation model of delayed aging in humans indicate that it 
has the potential to increase not only the length of life but also the fraction 
and number of years spent disability-free at older ages. Delayed aging would 
likely come with additional aggregate costs. These costs could be offset if 
delayed aging is widely applied and people are willing to convert their greater 
healthiness into more years of work.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term clinical and economic outcomes of naproxen, 
ibuprofen, celecoxib or tramadol for OA patients with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and diabetes.
DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model to examine treatment with these 
analgesics after standard of care (SOC) - acetaminophen and corticosteroid 
injections - failed to control pain. NSAID regimens were evaluated with and 
without proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We evaluated over-the-counter (OTC) 
regimens where available. Estimates of treatment efficacy (pain reduction, 
occurring in ∼57% of patients on all regimens) and toxicity (major cardiac or 
gastrointestinal toxicity or fractures, risk ranging from 1.09% with celecoxib 
to 5.62% with tramadol) were derived from published literature. Annual costs 
came from Red Book Online(®). Outcomes were discounted at 3%/year and included 
costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Key input parameters were varied in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Adding ibuprofen to SOC was cost saving, increasing QALYs by 0.07 while 
decreasing cost by $800. Incorporating OTC naproxen rather than ibuprofen added 
0.01 QALYs and increased costs by $300, resulting in an ICER of $54,800/QALY. 
Using prescription naproxen with OTC PPIs led to an ICER of $76,700/QALY, while 
use of prescription naproxen with prescription PPIs resulted in an ICER of 
$252,300/QALY. Regimens including tramadol or celecoxib cost more but added 
fewer QALYs and thus were dominated by several of the naproxen-containing 
regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multiple comorbidities, naproxen- and 
ibuprofen-containing regimens are more effective and cost-effective in managing 
OA pain than opioids, celecoxib or SOC.

Development of a methodology for electronic waste estimation: A material flow

Improved living standards and the share of services sector to the economy in 
Asia, and the use of electronic equipment is on the rise and results in 
increased electronic waste generation. A peculiarity of electronic waste is that 
it has a 'significant' value even after its life time, and to add complication, 
even after its extended life in its 'dump' stage. Thus, in Indian situations, 
after its life time is over, the e-material changes hands more than once and 
finally ends up either in the hands of informal recyclers or in the store rooms 
of urban dwellings. This character makes it extremely difficult to estimate 
electronic waste generation. The present study attempts to develop a functional 
model based on a material flow analysis approach by considering all possible end 
uses of the material, its transformed goods finally arriving at disposal. It 
considers various degrees of uses derived of the e-goods regarding their primary 
use (life time), secondary use (first degree extension of life), third-hand use 
(second degree extension of life), donation, retention at the respective places 
(without discarding), fraction shifted to scrap vendor, and the components 
reaching the final dump site from various end points of use. This 'generic 
functional model' named SYE-Waste Model, developed based on a material flow 
analysis approach, can be used to derive 'obsolescence factors' for various 
degrees of usage of e-goods and also to make a comprehensive estimation of 
electronic waste in any city/country.

OBJECTIVES: Prior reports have linked patient transmission of 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE, or "superbug") to endoscopes used 
during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We performed a 
decision analysis to measure the cost-effectiveness of four competing strategies 
for CRE risk management.
METHODS: We used decision analysis to calculate the cost-effectiveness of four 
approaches to reduce the risk of CRE transmission among patients presenting to 
the hospital for symptomatic common bile duct stones. The strategies included 
the following: (1) perform ERCP followed by US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-recommended endoscope reprocessing procedures; (2) perform ERCP followed 
by "endoscope culture and hold"; (3) perform ERCP followed by ethylene oxide 
(EtO) sterilization of the endoscope; and (4) stop performing ERCP in lieu of 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with common bile duct exploration (CBDE). Our 
outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, ERCP with FDA-recommended endoscope 
reprocessing was the most cost-effective strategy. Both the ERCP with culture 
and hold ($4,228,170/QALY) and ERCP with EtO sterilization ($50,572,348/QALY) 
strategies had unacceptable incremental costs per QALY gained. LC with CBDE was 
dominated, being both more costly and marginally less effective vs. the 
alternatives. In sensitivity analysis, ERCP with culture and hold became the 
most cost-effective approach when the pretest probability of CRE exceeded 24%.
CONCLUSIONS: In institutions with a low CRE prevalence, ERCP with 
FDA-recommended reprocessing is the most cost-effective approach for mitigating 
CRE transmission risk. Only in settings with an extremely high CRE prevalence 
did ERCP with culture and hold become cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Occupation is a significant factor affecting life, health and 
well-being. Long-term military service is a unique career path that may have an 
influence on life expectancy, even after excluding obvious risks such as 
battlefield mortality. However, it remains unclear what the effects of a 
military career are on the life trajectory of personnel after retiring from 
service. This study compared life expectancy among retired military personnel 
(RMP) to their sex and birth cohort-specific reference populations.
METHODS: For this historical cohort study, we collected data on the sex, year of 
birth, year of death, time in service, and rank at end of service for 4862 
Israeli RMPs. Data on reference populations were provided by the Israel Central 
Bureau of Statistics by birth decade from 1900 to 1989. We calculated the 
difference between each individual RMP's age at death and the "expected" age at 
death, based on sex and birth cohort-specific means in the reference 
populations.
RESULTS: Overall, 67.9 % of RMPs lived longer than average relative to their 
sex-specific birth cohort. This difference in life expectancy was more 
pronounced among women than among men. There was a significant trend of 
increasing differences between RMP males and reference males over time 
(P < 0.002), whereas no significant trend was identified among females. Length 
of service and rank were not associated with relative longevity for RMPs.
CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of the protective effect of military service on life 
expectancy remains unknown, but our findings indicate that it affects men and 
women differently, with women being more likely to benefit from the potential 
protective effect of military service. The healthy worker effect is known to 
vary from one occupation to another, and to the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first attempt to quantify the magnitude of the healthy worker effect among 
career military servicemen and women.

DNA polymerase β (pol β) is a key enzyme in DNA base excision repair, and an 
important factor for maintaining genomic integrity and stability. Esophageal 
carcinoma (EC) patients who have been identified as carrying the K167I variant 
of pol β have been shown to have decreased life expectancy. However, it is 
unknown if the variant affects pol β's functions and/or how it contributes to 
the initiation and progression of cancer. In this study, we expressed and
