or 3), and only lumbar hematoma was associated with a good initial clinical 
neurological status (NG 0 or 1). Surgery was performed in 767 (80%) cases. 
Mortality was greater in patients older than 40 years of age (9%; p < 0.01). Sex 
did not influence any of these data (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Factors that 
contribute to the formation of acute SEH are iatrogenic, not iatrogenic, or 
multifactorial. The treatment of choice is surgery, and the results of treatment 
are influenced by the patient's clinical and neurological status at admission, 
age, and the craniocaudal site.

Plant lodging resistance is an important integrative agronomic trait of grain 
yield and quality in crops. Although extensin proteins are tightly associated 
with plant cell growth and cell wall construction, little has yet been reported 
about their impacts on plant lodging resistance. In this study, we isolated a 
novel extensin-like (OsEXTL) gene in rice, and selected transgenic rice plants 
that expressed OsEXTL under driven with two distinct promoters. Despite 
different OsEXTL expression levels, two-promoter-driven OsEXTL-transgenic 
plants, compared to a rice cultivar and an empty vector, exhibited significantly 
reduced cell elongation in stem internodes, leading to relatively shorter plant 
heights by 7%-10%. Meanwhile, the OsEXTL-transgenic plants showed remarkably 
thickened secondary cell walls with higher cellulose levels in the mature 
plants, resulting in significantly increased detectable mechanical strength 
(extension and pushing forces) in the mature transgenic plants. Due to reduced 
plant height and increased plant mechanical strength, the OsEXTL-transgenic 
plants were detected with largely enhanced lodging resistances in 3 years field 
experiments, compared to those of the rice cultivar ZH11. In addition, despite 
relatively short plant heights, the OsEXTL-transgenic plants maintain normal 
grain yields and biomass production, owing to their increased cellulose levels 
and thickened cell walls. Hence, this study demonstrates a largely improved 
lodging resistance in the OsEXTL-transgenic rice plants, and provides insights 
into novel extensin functions in plant cell growth and development, cell wall 
network construction and wall structural remodelling.

Failing States as Epidemiologic Risk Zones: Implications for Global Health 
Security.

Hirschfeld K(1).

Author information:

Anthropology, University of Oklahoma , Norman, OK.

Failed states commonly experience health and mortality crises that include 
outbreaks of infectious disease, violent conflict, reductions in life 
expectancy, and increased infant and maternal mortality. This article draws from 
recent research in political science, security studies, and international 
relations to explore how the process of state failure generates health declines 
and outbreaks of infectious disease. The key innovation of this model is a 
revised definition of "the state" as a geographically dynamic rather than static 
political space. This makes it easier to understand how phases of territorial 
contraction, collapse, and regeneration interrupt public health programs, 
destabilize the natural environment, reduce human security, and increase risks 
of epidemic infectious disease and other humanitarian crises. Better 
understanding of these dynamics will help international health agencies predict 
and prepare for future health and mortality crises created by failing states.

Purpose Whether the ASCO Value Framework and the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS) measure similar 
constructs of clinical benefit is unclear. It is also unclear how they relate to 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and funding recommendations in the United 
Kingdom and Canada. Methods Randomized clinical trials of oncology drug 
approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, and 
Health Canada between 2006 and August 2015 were identified and scored using the 
ASCO version 1 (v1) framework, ASCO version 2 (v2) framework, and ESMO-MCBS by 
at least two independent reviewers. Spearman correlation coefficients were 
calculated to assess construct (between frameworks) and criterion validity 
(against QALYs from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] 
and the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review [pCODR]). Associations between scores 
and NICE/pCODR recommendations were examined. Inter-rater reliability was 
assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Results From 109 included 
randomized clinical trials, 108 ASCOv1, 111 ASCOv2, and 83 ESMO scores were 
determined. Correlation coefficients for ASCOv1 versus ESMO, ASCOv2 versus ESMO, 
and ASCOv1 versus ASCOv2 were 0.36 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.54), 0.17 (95% CI, -0.06 
to 0.37), and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.63), respectively. Compared with NICE 
QALYs, correlation coefficients were 0.45 (ASCOv1), 0.53 (ASCOv2), and 0.46 
(ESMO); with pCODR QALYs, coefficients were 0.19 (ASCOv1), 0.20 (ASCOv2), and 
0.36 (ESMO). None of the frameworks were significantly associated with 
NICE/pCODR recommendations. Inter-rater reliability was good for all frameworks. 
Conclusion The weak-to-moderate correlations of the ASCO frameworks with the 
ESMO-MCBS, as well as their correlations with QALYs and with NICE/pCODR funding 
recommendations, suggest different constructs of clinical benefit measured. 
Construct convergent validity with the ESMO-MCBS did not increase with the 
updated ASCO framework.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and 
radiological outcomes of the use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell 
concentrate obtained with selective cell retention technology using Cellect with 
a particular collagen scaffold, Healos for posterolateral spinal fusion.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With the increasing rate of spinal fusion, the 
problem of pseudarthrosis, which contributes to recurrent pain with patient 
disability, is considered to be the most common cause of revision lumbar spine 
surgery. Intensive research is being carried out to develop an alternative 
source of bone grafting and improve the spinal fusion rate.
METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital records was performed. Identified 
patients were contacted to have a clinical and radiological evaluation 
follow-up. Clinical outcome was evaluated using visual analog scales for the 
back pain (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and quality of life 
(EQ-5D) questionnaire. Radiological outcome was evaluated by performing dynamic 
flexion/extension lateral views and calculation of segmental Cobb angle. Any 
implant-associated complication was reported. Computed tomography (CT) scans 
were also performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included and all patients achieved successful 
fusion. The mean difference of the segmental Cobb angle was 0.48° (range 
0.3°-0.7°). Computed tomography scans showed solid bilateral fusion with 
bridging bone (Grade I) in all patients, but solid unilateral fusion with 
bridging bone (Grade II) was detected for one patient at one level. Patients 
started to resume working activities within a mean period of 3.5 months. The VAS 
score for the residual back pain was 4.1 ± 2.1, whereas the ODI was 10.5 ± 5.6 
points, and the mean disability index was 21.1%.
CONCLUSION: The use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell concentrate obtained 
with selective cell retention technology could be considered as an effective 
means for augmenting spinal fusion.

Brochothrix thermosphacta is the predominant spoilage microorganism in meat and 
its control in processing environments is important to maintain meat product 
quality. Atmospheric cold plasma is of interest for control of pathogenic and 
spoilage microorganisms in foods. This study ascertained the potential of 
dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric cold plasma (DBD-ACP) for control of 
B. thermosphacta, taking microbial and food environment factors into 
consideration, and investigated the shelf-life of lamb chop after in-package 
plasma treatment in modified atmosphere. Community profiling was used to assess 
the treatment effects on the lamb microflora. ACP treatment (80 kV) for 30s 
inactivated B. thermosphacta populations below detection levels in PBS, while 
5 min treatment achieved a 2 Log cycle reduction using a complex meat model 
medium and attached cells. The antimicrobial efficacy of plasma was reduced but 
still apparent on lamb chop surface-inoculated with high concentrations of 
B. thermosphacta. Lamb chop treated under modified atmosphere exhibited reduced 
microbial growth over the product shelf-life and community profiling showed no 
evident changes to the microbial populations after the treatment. The overall 
results indicated potential of ACP to enhance microbial control leading to meat 
storage life extension through adjusting the modality of treatment.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Midurethral sling procedures are the first surgical 
option in women undergoing surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). 
Single-incision midurethral-slings (SIMS) were designed to provide similar 
efficacy to traditional midurethral slings but with reduced morbidity. In this 
international trial we compared the efficacy of a SIMS (MiniArc) and a 
transobturator standard midurethral sling (SMUS; Monarc) in the treatment of SUI 
in terms of subjective and objective cure rates and morbidity over a long-term 
follow-up.
METHODS: This was a randomized controlled nonblinded extended trial with a 
follow-up period of 36 months. Women with symptomatic SUI were eligible. The 
primary outcome was subjective cure, defined as an improvement in the Patient 
Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Secondary outcomes were 
objective cure (negative cough stress test), disease-specific quality of life, 
surgical parameters and morbidity. An intention to treat analysis was performed. 
Differences in dichotomous variables were tested using the chi-squared test. 
Differences in continuous variables were tested using Student's t test or the 
Mann-Whitney U test. We hypothesized that MiniArc would be noninferior to Monarc 
concerning subjective cure.
RESULTS: We randomized 97 women to the MiniArc group and 96 to the Monarc group. 
The attrition rate was 23% in the MiniArc group and 22% in the Monarc group 
after 3 years. At 36 months, the subjective cure rates were 86% in the MiniArc 
group and 87% in the Monarc group (risk difference -0.6%, 95% CI -12 to 11%). 
The objective cure rates were 89% and 88%, respectively (risk difference 1.3%, 
95% CI -9 to 11%). Both procedures were associated with low complication rates.
CONCLUSIONS: After a follow-up of 36 months, MiniArc (SIMS) is non-inferior to 
Monarc (SMUS) with respect to subjective and objective cure.

INTRODUCTION: Distal biceps brachii tendon rupture can lead to 30-40% power loss 
of elbow flexion and up to 50% of forearm supination. Re-fixation of the distal 
biceps brachii tendon is recommended to warrant an adequate quality of the 
patient's life. This study reports the isometric and isokinetic results after 
anchor re-fixation 2.5 years after surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, 69 patients with distal biceps 
brachii tendon tear underwent a suture anchor reattachment. During the follow-up 
examination, a questionnaire and DASH score were filled in, the circumferences 
of the arm were measured, range of motion was collected, and different trials 
were conducted at the BTE Primus RS™ (Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment) on both 
arms.
RESULTS: 49 patients (71%) were reinvestigated with a follow-up of 32 months 
(11-58 months). A significant difference was found in the ability of elbow 
flexion between the affected arm and the opposite side as well as in pronation 
and supination. In elbow flexion and extension as well as in pronation and 
supination of the forearm, the strength was significantly diminished.
CONCLUSIONS: 32 months after surgical re-fixation of the distal biceps brachii 
tendon rupture, strength in all exercises is marginally reduced in comparison to 
the opposite arm. Re-fixation of the distal biceps brachii tendon is an adequate 
method to return the range of motion and the strength in the elbow joint to an 
almost normal level and that gives rise to a high level of patient satisfaction.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the trade-offs society 
and payers make when expanding treatment access to patients with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in early stages of disease as well as to 
vulnerable, high-risk populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID) and 
HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM-HIV).
METHODS: A discrete time Markov model simulated HCV progression and treatment 
over 20 years. Population cohorts were defined by behaviors that influence the 
risk of HCV exposure: PWID, MSM-HIV, an overlap cohort of individuals who are 
both PWID and MSM-HIV, and all other adults. Six different treatment scenarios 
were modeled, with varying degrees of access to treatment at different fibrosis 
stages and to different risk cohorts. Benefits were measured as quality-adjusted 
life-years and a $150,000/quality-adjusted life-year valuation was used to 
assess social benefits.
RESULTS: Compared with limiting treatment to METAVIR fibrosis stages F3 or F4 
and excluding PWID, expanding treatment to patients in all fibrosis stages and 
including PWID reduces cumulative new infections by 55% over a 20-year horizon 
and reduces the prevalence of HCV by 93%. We find that treating all HCV-infected 
individuals is cost saving and net social benefits are over $500 billion greater 
compared with limiting treatment. Including PWID in treatment access saves 
12,900 to 41,200 lives.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased access to treatment brings substantial value to society 
and over the long-term reduces costs for payers, as the benefits accrued from 
long-term reduction in prevalent and incident cases, mortality, and medical 
costs outweigh the cost of treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of complete revascularization at 
index admission compared with infarct-related artery (IRA) treatment only, in 
patients with multivessel disease undergoing primary percutaneous coronary 
intervention (P-PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
METHODS: An economic evaluation of a multicenter randomized trial was conducted, 
comparing complete revascularization at index admission to IRA-only P-PCI in 
patients with multivessel disease (12-month follow-up). Overall hospital costs 
(costs for P-PCI procedure(s), hospital length of stay, and any subsequent 
re-admissions) were estimated. Outcomes were major adverse cardiac events 
(MACEs, a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, heart 
failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization) and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) derived from the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. 
Multiple imputation was undertaken. The mean incremental cost and effect, with 
associated 95% confidence intervals, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were estimated.
RESULTS: On the basis of 296 patients, the mean incremental overall hospital 
cost for complete revascularization was estimated to be -£215.96 (-£1390.20 to 
£958.29), compared with IRA-only, with a per-patient mean reduction in MACEs of 
0.170 (0.044 to 0.296) and a QALY gain of 0.011 (-0.019 to 0.041). According to 
the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, the probability of complete 
revascularization being cost-effective was estimated to be 72.0% at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold value of £20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete revascularization at index admission was estimated to be 
more effective (in terms of MACEs and QALYs) and cost-effective (overall costs 
were estimated to be lower and complete revascularization thereby dominated 
IRA-only). There was, however, some uncertainty associated with this decision.

BACKGROUND: The 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic generated additional data and 
triggered new studies that opened debate over the optimal strategy for handling 
a pandemic. The lessons-learned documents from the World Health Organization 
show the need for a cost estimation of the pandemic response during the 
risk-assessment phase. Several years after the crisis, what conclusions can we 
draw from this field of research?
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this article was to provide an analysis of the 
studies that present cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses for A/H1N1 
pandemic interventions since 2009 and to identify which measures seem most 
cost-effective.
METHODS: We reviewed 18 academic articles that provide cost-effectiveness or 
cost-benefit analyses for A/H1N1 pandemic interventions since 2009. Our review 
converts the studies' results into a cost-utility measure (cost per 
disability-adjusted life-year or quality-adjusted life-year) and presents the 
contexts of severity and fatality.
RESULTS: The existing studies suggest that hospital quarantine, vaccination, and 
usage of the antiviral stockpile are highly cost-effective, even for mild 
pandemics. However, school closures, antiviral treatments, and social distancing 
may not qualify as efficient measures, for a virus like 2009's H1N1 and a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $45,000 per disability-adjusted life-year. Such 
interventions may become cost-effective for severe crises.
CONCLUSIONS: This study helps to shed light on the cost-utility of various 
interventions, and may support decision making, among other criteria, for future 
pandemics. Nonetheless, one should consider these results carefully, considering 
these may not apply to a specific crisis or country, and a dedicated 
cost-effectiveness assessment should be conducted at the time.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates predictive factors for observed 
long-term survival of more than 5 and 10 years for patients after liver 
resection for hepatocellular carcinoma and compares their life expectancy to the 
normal national population matched for sex, year of birth and age at resection.
METHODS: 230 patients after primary liver resection for HCC 
(01.01.1995-31.12.2004) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models 
were determined based on Cox regression results and their prognostic capability 
evaluated with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs).
RESULTS: Life years after surgery in deceased patients compared to the normal 
national population matched for sex, year of birth and age at resection was 
reduced by median 21.7 years. Independent predictive factors for 10-year 
survival were age at resection (p < 0.001; OR = 0.898; 95%-CI: 0.846-0.954), 
UICC 7 tumor staging (p = 0.003; OR = 0.344; 95%-CI: 0.126-0.941) and ASAT (GOT) 
in U/l divided by Quick in percent multiplied by the extent of liver resection 
graded in points labelled as the resection severity index (p < 0.001; 
OR = 0.136; 95%-CI: 0.022-0.843) enabling prediction of 10-year survival with an 
AUROC of 0.884. The same factors plus revision surgery (yes/no) predict 5-year 
survival (AUROC 0.736).
CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection enables predictable long-term survival >5 and > 10 
years. The proposed resection severity index quantifies the prognostic relevance 
of liver cellular damage, synthesis and loss of parenchyma for long-term 
survival.

Patients with metastatic disease including polymetastatic, oligometastatic, and 
oligorecurrent spinal lesions have extended life expectancy secondary to 
improvements in systemic agents, and thus require durable local control of spine 
metastases. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), which uses highly conformal 
treatment planning techniques coupled with image-guided technology, has enabled 
the safe delivery of tumor-ablative doses of radiotherapy. The NOMS decision 
framework has been developed as a tool to aid in the determination of the 
optimal treatment of spinal metastases, incorporating radiosurgery, separation 
surgery, stabilization techniques, and conventional radiation. Tumor 
radiosensitivity is critical in determining appropriateness of radiosurgery. In 
general, higher radiation doses provide significant, more durable tumor control, 
whether single-fraction or hypofractionated regimens are used. Spine SBRT can 
provide a high likelihood of durable tumor control with very low rates of 
serious toxicity, and careful attention should be given to dose constraints of 
organs at risk. Here, we review the indications for spine SBRT via the NOMS 
decision framework and provide practical information to the radiation oncologist 
regarding spine radiosurgery.

This study aimed to identify the excess risks associated with diabetic patients 
with early kidney involvement (early diabetic kidney disease). The mortality 
risks of early diabetic kidney disease, defined as diabetes in early stages 1-3 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), were assessed from a cohort of 512,700 adults in 
Taiwan participating in a health surveillance program from 1994-2008. Three 
related groups were identified and compared: diabetes without CKD, early 
diabetic kidney disease, and early CKD without diabetes. Deaths were ascertained 
through the National Death Registry. One-third of diabetics had early kidney 
disease, and approximately two-thirds of patients were classified with early CKD 
due to proteinuria. Patients with early diabetic kidney disease had more 
lifestyle risks such as inactivity or obesity, which characteristically 
amplified excess mortality by up to five times. The three-fold increase in 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 3.16) and a 16-year loss in life expectancy 
made early diabetic kidney disease a serious and yet often overlooked disease, 
with most patients unaware of their kidney involvement. Mortality for early 
diabetic kidney disease was nearly twice as high as that for early CKD (hazard 
ratio 2.01) or diabetes without CKD (hazard ratio 1.79). The 16-year life span 
loss is much worse than individually from early CKD (six years) or diabetes (ten 
years). Thus, identifying early proteinuria among diabetic patients and 
realizing the importance of reducing lifestyle risks like inactivity is a 
clinical challenge, but can save lives.

OBJECTIVES: Data suggesting a link between the fallopian tube and ovarian cancer 
have led to an increase in rates of salpingectomy at the time of pelvic surgery, 
a practice known as opportunistic salpingectomy (OS). However, the potential 
benefits, risks and costs for this new practice are not well established. Our 
objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy at 
the time of laparoscopic permanent contraception or hysterectomy for benign 
indications.
METHODS: We created two models to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
salpingectomy versus usual care. The hypothetical study population is 50,000 
women aged 45 undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with ovarian preservation for 
benign indications, and 300,000 women aged 35 undergoing laparoscopic permanent 
contraception. SEER data were used for probabilities of ovarian cancer cases and 
deaths. The ovarian cancer risk reduction, complication rates, utilities and 
associated costs were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses 
and Monte Carlo simulation were performed, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine the cost per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the laparoscopic hysterectomy cohort, OS is cost saving and would 
yield $23.9 million in health care dollars saved. In the laparoscopic permanent 
contraception cohort, OS is cost-effective with an ICER of $31,432/QALY compared 
to tubal ligation, and remains cost-effective as long as it reduces ovarian 
cancer risk by 54%. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated cost-effectiveness with 
hysterectomy and permanent contraception in 62.3% and 55% of trials, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic salpingectomy for low-risk women undergoing pelvic 
surgery may be a cost-effective strategy for decreasing ovarian cancer risk at 
time of hysterectomy or permanent contraception. In our model, salpingectomy was 
cost-effective with both procedures, but the advantage greater at time of 
hysterectomy.

Exposure to small particulate matter (PM2.5) has become the 5th highest ranking 
risk factor for death, responsible for 4.2 million deaths worldwide. PM 
pollution is also associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, 
and may contribute to deteriorate the already poor cardiometabolic outlook of 
the diabetic patient. Although most sources of outdoor air pollution are well 
beyond the control of individuals, there is still room for personal action. 
Health behaviors (smoking cessation, avoiding obesity, and increasing physical 
activity) may increase the poor life expectancy of individuals in the lowest 
income quartile of the Western population; moreover, a favorable lifestyle, (no 
current smoking, no obesity, physical activity at least once weekly, and a 
healthy diet pattern), may cut by nearly 50% the risk of coronary heart disease 
among people at high genetic risk. Things seem not immutable, as individual 
healthy choices do matter.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness and cost of a fungal meningitis 
outbreak response in the New River Valley of Virginia during 2012-2013 from the 
perspective of the local public health department and clinical facilities. The 
fungal meningitis outbreak affected 23 states in the United States with 751 
cases and 64 deaths in 20 states; there were 56 cases and 5 deaths in Virginia.
METHODS: We conducted a partial economic evaluation of the fungal meningitis 
outbreak response in New River Valley. We collected costs associated with the 
local health department and clinical facilities in the outbreak response and 
estimated the epidemiological effectiveness by using disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) averted.
RESULTS: We estimated the epidemiological effectiveness of this outbreak 
response to be 153 DALYs averted among the patients, and the costs incurred by 
the local health department and clinical facilities to be $30,413 and $39,580, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $198 per 
DALY averted and $258 per DALY averted from the local health department and 
clinical perspectives, respectively, thereby assisting in impact evaluation of 
the outbreak response by the local health department and clinical facilities.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
(GBD 2015) provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of diarrhoeal diseases. 
This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 25 years 
and informs the changing picture of diarrhoeal disease worldwide.
METHODS: We estimated diarrhoeal mortality by age, sex, geography, and year 
using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm), a modelling platform shared 
across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study. We modelled diarrhoeal 
morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform 
called DisMod-MR. We estimated aetiologies for diarrhoeal diseases using a 
counterfactual approach that incorporates the aetiology-specific risk of 
diarrhoeal disease and the prevalence of the aetiology in diarrhoea episodes. We 
used the Socio-demographic Index, a summary indicator derived from measures of 
income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to assess trends in 
diarrhoeal mortality. The two leading risk factors for diarrhoea-childhood 
malnutrition and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene-were used in a 
decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of changes in 
diarrhoea disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2015, we estimate that diarrhoea was a leading cause of 
death among all ages (1·31 million deaths, 95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 
1·23 million to 1·39 million), as well as a leading cause of DALYs because of 
its disproportionate impact on young children (71·59 million DALYs, 66·44 
million to 77·21 million). Diarrhoea was a common cause of death among children 
under 5 years old (499 000 deaths, 95% UI 447 000-558 000). The number of deaths 
due to diarrhoea decreased by an estimated 20·8% (95% UI 15·4-26·1) from 2005 to 
2015. Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea deaths (199 000, 95% UI 
165 000-241 000), followed by Shigella spp (164 300, 85 000-278 700) and 
Salmonella spp (90 300, 95% UI 34 100-183 100). Among children under 5 years 
old, the three aetiologies responsible for the most deaths were rotavirus, 
Cryptosporidium spp, and Shigella spp. Improvements in safe water and sanitation 
have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 13·4%, and reductions in childhood 
undernutrition have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 10·0% between 2005 and 2015.
INTERPRETATION: At the global level, deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have 
decreased substantially in the past 25 years, although progress has been faster 
in some countries than others. Diarrhoea remains a largely preventable disease 
and cause of death, and continued efforts to improve access to safe water, 
sanitation, and childhood nutrition will be important in reducing the global 
burden of diarrhoea.

Aging Reversal and Healthy Longevity is in Reach: Dependence on Mitochondrial 
DNA Heteroplasmy as a Key Molecular Target.

Stefano GB(1), Kream RM(1).

Recent trends in biomedical research have highlighted the potential for 
effecting significant extensions in longevity with enhanced quality of life in 
aging human populations. Within this context, any proposed method to achieve 
enhanced life extension must include therapeutic approaches that draw upon 
essential biochemical and molecular regulatory processes found in relatively 
simple single cell organisms that are evolutionarily conserved within complex 
organ systems of higher animals. Current critical thinking has established the 
primacy of mitochondrial function in maintaining good health throughout plant 
and animal phyla. The mitochondrion represents an existentially defined 
endosymbiotic model of complex organelle development driven by evolutionary 
modification of a permanently enslaved primordial bacterium. Cellular 
mitochondria are biochemically and morphologically tailored to provide 
exponentially enhanced ATP-dependent energy production accordingly to tissue- 
and organ-specific physiological demands. Thus, individual variations in 
longevity may then be effectively sorted according to age-dependent losses of 
single-cell metabolic integrity functionally linked to impaired mitochondrial 
bioenergetics within an aggregate presentation of compromised complex organ 
systems. Recent empirical studies have focused on the functional role of 
mitochondrial heteroplasmy in the regulation of normative cellular processes and 
the initiation and persistence of pathophysiological states. Accordingly, 
elucidation of the multifaceted functional roles of mitochondrial heteroplasmy 
in normal aging and enhanced longevity will provide both a compelling genetic 
basis and potential targets for therapeutic intervention to effect meaningful 
life extension in human populations.

Alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing is a basic mechanism of gene 
regulation. In general, reverse transcription and polymerase based primer 
extension limit the sensitivity and selectivity of the current detection of mRNA 
splice variants, respectively. Here, we show that, using the ligation of two 
properly designed probes at the exon junction combined with universal PCR 
amplification, as little as a single copy of a mRNA splice variant per cell can 
be accurately determined, and the dynamic range covers six orders of magnitude. 
Three mRNA splice variants were measured from total RNA samples derived from 
different cell lines. Moreover, by encoding the ligation probes with different 
lengths, multiplexed mRNA splice variants can be simultaneously detected in 
one-tube PCR amplification using electrophoretic separation.

Sickle Cell Disease encompasses a group of disorders related with the hemoglobin 
S and other hemoglobin genotypes. The clinical manifestation and the severity of 
symptoms are dependent on the specific genotype. In this setting, homozygous 
genotype (HbSS) presents an early onset of symptoms and a low expectancy of 
lifetime. However, the SC genotype (HbSC), which apparently shows a less severe 
clinical course, may exhibit the same complications of HbSS. These complications 
are usually manifested late in the course of life, when compared with the HbSS 
patients. It is noteworthy that HbSC may present a normal hematocrit, and 
therefore stays unknown until the first complication, that may be disastrous. 
The authors report a case of an African-Descendant woman, aging 65 years, with 
no previous diagnosis of anemia who sought medical attention because of a 
thoracic back pain followed by fever and altered mental status. The clinical 
picture deteriorated very fast with multiple organ failure and death. The 
autopsy findings concluded by generalized vaso-occlusive crisis, bone marrow 
necrosis and bone marrow and fat embolism, mainly to the lungs and kidney. The 
authors call attention for the knowledge of this severe life threatening 
complication, mainly in a country with a high Afro-Descendant population.
