[Significance age-related predictors of chronic heart failure in determining the 
risk of death in elderly patients with hypertension].

[Article in Russian]

Medvedev NV, Gorshunova NK.

In order to establish the prognostic value of age-related pathogenesis and the 
development of heart failure related to lipid peroxidation, endogenous 
subclinical inflammation, apoptosis, sarcopenia, interstitial myocardial 
fibrosis in the risk of mortality and survival rates, for the first time the 
results of echocardiography, enzyme immunoassay, bioimpedansmetry with the scale 
of the Seattle model of heart failure performed in 84 elderly patients with 
arterial hypertension stage II (middle age 68,3 +/- 1,8 years) were compared. We 
found that the increased activity of markers of chronic heart failure 
progression was associated with an increased risk of death in patients. We 
identified the most important indicators in assessing the risk of death and 
prognosis of heart failure in elderly patients; their timely correction will 
imply an increase in life expectancy of older patients with chronic heart 
failure.

Recent animal and clinical studies report promising results for the therapeutic 
utilization of stem cells in regenerative medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs), with their pluripotent nature, have advantages over embryonic stem cells 
in terms of their availability and feasibility. However, their proliferative 
activity is destined to slow by replicative senescence, and the limited 
proliferative potential of MSCs not only hinders the preparation of sufficient 
cells for in vivo application, but also draws a limitation on their potential 
for differentiation. This calls for the development of safe and efficient means 
to increase the proliferative as well as differentiation potential of MSCs. 
Recent advances have led to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
and significance of cellular senescence, facilitating ways to manipulate the 
replicative lifespan of a variety of primary cells, including MSCs. This paper 
introduces a class of proteins that function as senescence suppressors. Like 
tumor suppressors, these proteins are lost in senescence, while their forced 
expression delays the onset of senescence. Moreover, treatments that increase 
the expression or the activity of senescence suppressors, therefore, cause 
expansion of the replicative and differentiation potential of MSCs. The nature 
of the activities and putative underlying mechanisms of the senescence 
suppressors will be discussed to facilitate their evaluation.

We conducted a cost-utility analysis of a telehealth programme for patients with 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with usual care. A 
randomized controlled trial was carried out over four months with 45 patients 
treated with long-term oxygen therapy, 24 in the telehealth group (TG) and 21 in 
the control group (CG). The analysis took into account whether the severity of 
comorbidity (defined as the presence of additional chronic diseases co-occurring 
with COPD) was associated with differences in costs and/or quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Results of cost-utility analysis were expressed in terms of the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The average total cost was €2300 
for the TG and €1103 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0059 for the TG 
and 0.0006 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 223,726 €/QALY). For patients 
without comorbidity, the average total cost was €855 for the TG and €1354 for 
the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0288 for the TG and 0.0082 for the CG 
(resulting in the telehealth programme being the dominant strategy). For 
patients with comorbidity, the average total cost was €2782 for the TG and €949 
for the CG, and the average QALY gain was -0.0017 for the TG and -0.0041 for the 
CG (resulting an ICER of 754,592 €/QALY). The telehealth programme may not have 
been cost-effective compared to usual care, although it could be considered 
cost-effective for patients without comorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have investigated the effect of the 
quantity of green space on health outcomes such as self-rated health, morbidity 
and mortality ratios. These studies have consistently found positive 
associations between the quantity of green and health. However, the impact of 
other aspects, such as the perceived quality and average distance to public 
green, and the effect of urban green on population health are still largely 
unknown.
METHODS: Linear regression models were used to investigate the impact of three 
different measures of urban green on small-area life expectancy (LE) and healthy 
life expectancy (HLE) in The Netherlands. All regressions corrected for average 
neighbourhood household income, accommodated spatial autocorrelation, and took 
measurement uncertainty of LE, HLE as well as the quality of urban green into 
account.
RESULTS: Both the quantity and the perceived quality of urban green are modestly 
related to small-area LE and HLE: an increase of 1 SD in the percentage of urban 
green space is associated with a 0.1-year higher LE, and, in the case of quality 
of green, with an approximately 0.3-year higher LE and HLE. The average distance 
to the nearest public green is unrelated to population health.
CONCLUSIONS: The quantity and particularly quality of urban green are positively 
associated with small-area LE and HLE. This concurs with a growing body of 
evidence that urban green reduces stress, stimulates physical activity, improves 
the microclimate and reduces ambient air pollution. Accordingly, urban green 
development deserves a more prominent place in urban regeneration and 
neighbourhood renewal programmes.

BACKGROUND: High serum uric acid (sUA) has been associated with increased 
mortality risks, but its clinical treatment varied with potential side effects. 
The role of physical activity has received limited attention.
METHODS: A cohort, consisting of 467 976 adults, who went through a standard 
health screening programme, with questionnaire and fasting blood samples, was 
successively recruited between 1996 and 2008. High sUA is defined as uric acid 
above 7.0 mg/dL. Leisure time physical activity level was self-reported, with 
fully active defined as those with 30 min per day for at least 5 days a week. 
National death file identified 12 228 deaths with a median follow-up of 
8.5 years. Cox proportional model was used to analyse HRs, and 12 variables were 
controlled, including medical history, life style and risk factors.
FINDINGS: High sUA constituted one quarter of the cohort (25.6%). Their 
all-cause mortality was significantly increased [HR: 1.22 (1.15-1.29)], with 
much of the increase contributed to by the inactive (HR: 1.27 (1.17-1.37)), 
relative to the reference group with sUA level of 5-6 mg/dL. When they were 
fully active, mortality risks did not increase, but decreased by 11% (HR: 0.89 
(0.82-0.97)), reflecting the benefits of being active was able to overcome the 
adverse effects of high sUA. Given the same high sUA, a 4-6 years difference in 
life expectancy was found between the active and the inactive.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is a valuable alternative to pharmacotherapy in 
its ability to reduce the increases in mortality risks from high sUA. By being 
fully active, exercise can extend life span by 4-6 years, a level greater than 
the 1-4 years of life-shortening effect from high sUA.

Bone complications or skeletal-related events (SREs), typically defined as 
radiation to bone, pathological fractures, surgery to bone and spinal cord 
compression, occur frequently in patients with bone metastases. As the survival 
of patients with advanced lung cancer improves, preventing SREs is becoming 
increasingly clinically relevant. The aim of this analysis was to assess the 
impact of SREs on health resource utilisation (HRU) in European lung cancer 
patients with bone metastasis. This multinational, observational study included 
patients who had at least one SRE in the 97 days prior to enrolment, a life 
expectancy of ≥6 months and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 0-2. Data on HRU were retrospectively collected for up to 97 days 
prior to enrolment with a planned prospective follow-up for up to 18-21 months. 
The HRU measures included the number and length of inpatient hospitalisations 
and the number of outpatient visits and procedures. The investigators determined 
whether each HRU was attributable to a SRE. In total, 135 patients with lung 
cancer, enrolled at centres in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, 
contributed 214 SREs to this analysis. The median length [quartile (Q)1, Q3] of 
follow-up ranged from 1.5 (0.7, 3.3) to 5.6 (2.0, 8.2) months across the 
countries. Overall, 41% of the SREs required an inpatient stay, with a median 
(Q1, Q3) duration of 19.0 (6.0, 28.0) days. Spinal cord compression and surgery 
to bone were the SRE types most frequently requiring inpatient stays. Radiation 
to bone was associated with the largest number of outpatient visits and 
procedures. All the SREs resulting from bone metastases in patients with lung 
cancer contribute considerably to HRU and efforts to minimise the incidence of 
bone complications in these patients through appropriate treatments may help 
reduce this burden.

for Spinal Metastasis: LMNOP.

Study Design Review. Objective To describe a decision framework that 
incorporates key factors to be considered for optimal treatment of spinal 
metastasis and highlight how this system incorporates the Spinal Instability 
Neoplastic Score (SINS). Methods We describe how treatment options for spinal 
metastasis have broadened in recent years with advancements in stereotactic 
radiosurgery, vertebral augmentation, and other minimally invasive techniques. 
We discuss classification-based approaches to the treatment of spinal metastasis 
versus principles-based approaches and argue that the latter may be more 
appropriate for optimal patient informed consent. Case examples are provided. 
Results Scoring systems at best produce an estimate of life expectancy but fall 
short in incorporating all of the relevant factors that determine which 
treatment(s) may be indicated. We advocate a principle-based decision framework 
called LMNOP that considers: (L) location of disease with respect to the 
anterior and/or posterior columns of the spine and number of spinal levels 
involved (contiguous or non-contiguous); (M) mechanical instability as graded by 
SINS; (N) neurology (symptomatic epidural spinal cord compression); (O) oncology 
(histopathologic diagnosis), particularly with respect to radiosensitivity; and 
(P) patient fitness, patient wishes, prognosis (which is mostly dependent on 
tumor type), and response to prior therapy. Conclusions LMNOP is the first 
systematic approach to spinal metastasis that incorporates SINS. It is easy to 
remember, it addresses clinical factors not directly addressed by other systems, 
and it is adaptable to changes in technology.

OBJECTIVES: Decompressive craniectomy and barbiturate coma are often used as 
second-tier strategies when intracranial hypertension following severe traumatic 
brain injury is refractory to first-line treatments. Uncertainty surrounds the 
decision to choose either treatment option. We investigated which strategy is 
more economically attractive in this context.
DESIGN: We performed a cost-utility analysis. A Markov Monte Carlo 
microsimulation model with a life-long time horizon was created to compare 
quality-adjusted survival and cost of the two treatment strategies, from the 
perspective of healthcare payer. Model parameters were estimated from the 
literature. Two-dimensional simulation was used to incorporate parameter 
uncertainty into the model. Value of information analysis was conducted to 
identify major drivers of decision uncertainty and focus future research.
SETTING: Trauma centers in the United States.
SUBJECTS: Base case was a population of patients (mean age = 25 yr) who 
developed refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury.
INTERVENTIONS: We compared two treatment strategies: decompressive craniectomy 
and barbiturate coma.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Decompressive craniectomy was associated with an 
average gain of 1.5 quality-adjusted life years relative to barbiturate coma, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,565/quality-adjusted life 
year gained. Decompressive craniectomy resulted in a greater quality-adjusted 
life expectancy 86% of the time and was more cost-effective than barbiturate 
coma in 78% of cases if our willingness-to-pay threshold is 
$50,000/quality-adjusted life year and 82% of cases at a threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year. At older age, decompressive craniectomy 
continued to increase survival but at higher cost (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio = $197,906/quality-adjusted life year at mean age = 85 
yr).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on available evidence, decompressive craniectomy for the 
treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain 
injury provides better value in terms of costs and health gains than barbiturate 
coma. However, decompressive craniectomy might be less economically attractive 
for older patients. Further research, particularly on natural history of severe 
traumatic brain injury patients, is needed to make more informed treatment 
decisions.

Psychiatry, New York, New York.

Rapid identification of traumatic intracranial hematomas following closed head 
injury represents a significant health care need because of the potentially 
life-threatening risk they present. This study demonstrates the clinical utility 
of an index of brain electrical activity used to identify intracranial hematomas 
in traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting to the emergency department (ED). 
Brain electrical activity was recorded from a limited montage located on the 
forehead of 394 closed head injured patients who were referred for CT scans as 
part of their standard ED assessment. A total of 116 of these patients were 
found to be CT positive (CT+), of which 46 patients with traumatic intracranial 
hematomas (CT+) were identified for study. A total of 278 patients were found to 
be CT negative (CT-) and were used as controls. CT scans were subjected to 
quantitative measurements of volume of blood and distance of bleed from 
recording electrodes by blinded independent experts, implementing a validated 
method for hematoma measurement. Using an algorithm based on brain electrical 
activity developed on a large independent cohort of TBI patients and controls 
(TBI-Index), patients were classified as either positive or negative for 
structural brain injury. Sensitivity to hematomas was found to be 95.7% (95% CI 
= 85.2, 99.5), specificity was 43.9% (95% CI = 38.0, 49.9). There was no 
significant relationship between the TBI-Index and distance of the bleed from 
recording sites (F = 0.044, p = 0.833), or volume of blood measured F = 0.179, p 
= 0.674). Results of this study are a validation and extension of previously 
published retrospective findings in an independent population, and provide 
evidence that a TBI-Index for structural brain injury is a highly sensitive 
measure for the detection of potentially life-threatening traumatic intracranial 
hematomas, and could contribute to the rapid, quantitative evaluation and 
treatment of such patients.

BACKGROUND: Common chronic conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, are 
associated with increased psychological distress, functional limitations and 
shortened life expectancy, but whether these diseases alter aspects of 
personality remains unclear.
METHOD: To examine whether the onset of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, 
hypertension, arthritis and respiratory disease is associated with subsequent 
changes in personality traits of the five-factor model, we pooled data from the 
Health and Retirement Study, the Midlife in the United States Survey, and the 
graduate and sibling samples of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study for an 
individual-participant meta-analysis (total n=17,493; mean age at baseline 55.8 
years).
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, we observed consistent decreases in 
extraversion [-0.25 T-scores per one disease; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 
to -0.10], emotional stability (-0.40, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.19), conscientiousness 
(-0.44, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.30) and openness to experience (-0.25, 95% CI -0.37 
to -0.13) but not in agreeableness (-0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.08) after the onset 
of chronic diseases. The onset of each additional chronic disease accelerated 
the average age-related personality change by 2.5 years in decreasing 
extraversion, 5.5 years in decreasing conscientiousness, and 1.6 years in 
decreasing openness to experience, and attenuated the increasing levels of 
emotional stability by 1.9 years. Co-morbid conditions were associated with 
larger changes than single diseases, suggesting a dose-response association 
between morbidity and personality change.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that chronic diseases 
influence personality development in adulthood.

MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for uterine fibroid treatment: a 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

Technology Assessment, 101 Merrimac St, 10th Fl, Boston, MA 02114.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
a treatment strategy for symptomatic uterine fibroids that uses MRI-guided 
focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy relative to uterine artery 
embolization (UAE) or hysterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed a 
decision-analytic model to compare the cost effectiveness of three first-line 
treatment strategies: MRI-guided focused ultrasound, UAE, and hysterectomy. 
Treatment-specific short- and long-term utilities, lifetime costs, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were incorporated, allowing us to conduct an 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, using a societal willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY to designate a strategy as cost effective. 
Sensitivity analyses were subsequently performed on all key parameters. RESULTS. 
In the base-case analysis, UAE as a first-line treatment of symptomatic fibroids 
was the most effective and expensive strategy (22.75 QALYs; $22,968), followed 
by MRI-guided focused ultrasound (22.73 QALYs; $20,252) and hysterectomy (22.54 
QALYs; $11,253). MRI-guided focused ultrasound was cost effective relative to 
hysterectomy, with an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$47,891/QALY. The ICER of UAE relative to MRI-guided focused ultrasound was 
$234,565/QALY, exceeding the WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY, therefore rendering 
MRI-guided focused ultrasound also cost effective relative to UAE. In 
sensitivity analyses, results were robust to changes in most parameters but were 
sensitive to changes in probabilities of recurrence, symptom relief, and 
quality-of-life measures. CONCLUSION. First-line treatment of eligible women 
with MRI-guided focused ultra-sound is a cost-effective noninvasive strategy. 
For those not eligible for MRI-guided focused ultra-sound, UAE remains a 
cost-effective option. These recommendations integrate both the short- and 
long-term decrements in quality of life associated with the specific treatment 
modalities.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy of individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease 
(CKD) on hemodialysis has increased, however, with over years in treatment, 
there is impairment of cognitive function that affect adherence to therapy and 
dialysis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cognitive ability of individuals on hemodialysis 
through the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the relation to 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these individuals.
METHODS: We obtained demographic and clinical information of 75 individuals. To 
assess memory and cognition MMSE was applied, which was analyzed according to 
the different cutoff points proposed in the literature. After classifying the 
participants according to proposal of different studies, the causes of CKD and 
sociodemographic characteristics, individuals were divided into groups with and 
without cognitive impairment in an attempt to identify differences between them.
RESULTS: Most participants were men with a mean age of 59.2 years. The mean MMSE 
score was 24.16 points and there was no difference (p < 0.05) in MMSE results 
between the different causes of CKD. MMSE scores were correlated (p < 0.05) 
positively with years of schooling and income and inversely with age. According 
to the different cutoff points, six to 34 participants showed cognitive 
impairment and memory, and only three of these were classified with cognitive 
impairment for all cutoff points evaluated.
CONCLUSION: The average MMSE score declined with increasing age and increased 
with years of schooling and income per capita. No relationships were found to 
justify the harmful effects of dialysis process on cognition and memory.

INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease characterized by periods of 
mania or hypomania, depression, or a combination of both (mixed state). Because 
bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability, it represents an 
important economic burden on society. Asenapine (ASE) is a new second-generation 
antipsychotic developed and approved for the treatment of manic or mixed 
episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of the present study 
was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ASE compared to olanzapine (OLA) in the 
treatment of patients experiencing mixed episodes associated with bipolar I 
disorder in the context of the Italian National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model was developed to simulate the management of 
Italian bipolar I patients with mixed episodes over a 5-year time horizon by 
combining clinical parameters with resource utilization. An expert panel of 
Italian psychiatrists and health economists was responsible for adapting a UK 
model to the Italian context. The primary outcome measure of the economic 
evaluation was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio, where effectiveness is 
measured in terms of quality adjusted life-years gained. Scenario analyses, 
sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to 
test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: This pharmacoeconomic model showed that ASE resulted to be dominant 
over OLA; in fact, ASE was associated with lower direct costs (derived largely 
by the savings from hospitalizations avoided) and also generated a better 
quality of life. Results were robust to changes in key parameters; both scenario 
analyses and sensitivity analyses demonstrated model reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that the management of bipolar I 
patients with mixed episodes using ASE as alternative to OLA can lead to cost 
saving for the Italian NHS and improve patients quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: CT-angiography gains an increasing role in the initial diagnosis 
of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the 
implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of 
conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility 
and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.
METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our 
university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 
and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of 
treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and 
diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously 
admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. 
Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 
patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional 
angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had 
significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 
4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. 
Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography 
(p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm 
repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of 
diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits 
of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional 
angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of 
CT-angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis 
cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard 
to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.

efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of the complement inhibitor compstatin.

The compstatin family of complement inhibitors has shown promise in various 
immuno-inflammatory disorders. Although recent analogues show beneficial 
pharmacokinetics, further extension of the plasma half-life is expected to 
benefit systemic application of these peptidic inhibitors. We therefore 
synthesized conjugates of compstatin analogues and albumin-binding molecules 
(ABM) to increase circulatory residence. Equilibrium dialysis in 
complement-depleted serum showed a marked increase in plasma protein binding 
from <8 % to >99 % for a resulting chimera (ABM2-Cp20). Further analysis 
confirmed interaction with albumin from different species, primarily via 
site II. Importantly, ABM2-Cp20 bound 20-fold stronger to its target protein C3b 
(KD =150 pM) than the parent peptide. Kinetic and in silico analysis suggested 
that ABM2 occupies a secondary site on C3b and improves the dissociation rate 
via additional contacts. Addition of an ABM modifier thereby not only improved 
plasma protein binding but also produced the most potent compstatin analogue to 
date with potential implications for the treatment of systemic 
complement-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Nephrologists often face difficult decisions when recommending 
dialysis or non-dialysis (supportive) care for elderly patients, given the 
uncertainty around survival and the burden of dialysis. Discrete choice 
experiments (DCEs) mimic real-world decisions through simultaneous consideration 
of multiple variables. We aimed to determine the relative influence of patient 
characteristics on dialysis recommendations.
METHODS: We conducted a DCE among Australasian nephrologists consisting of 12 
scenarios of two patients (described in terms of age, gender, cognition, 
comorbidity, life expectancy, current quality of life (QOL), expected QOL with 
dialysis, social support, patient and family inclination). Nephrologists 
indicated which patient they preferred recommending dialysis for, or whether 
they preferred 'neither'. Mixed logit models determined the odds of recommending 
dialysis over no dialysis. Trade-offs between QOL and survival were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 159 nephrologists participated (34% aged 40-49 years, 62% 
male and 69% Caucasian). All patient characteristics except gender significantly 
affected the likelihood of dialysis recommendation. Nephrologists were more 
likely to recommend dialysis for patients with preserved cognition (odds ratio 
[OR]: 68.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 33.4-140.0), lower comorbidity (OR: 
2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.1), increased life expectancy (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 2.1-3.7), 
high current QOL (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 2.0-3.8) and positive patient and family 
dialysis inclination (OR: 27.5; 95% CI: 16.2-46.8 and OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.3, 
respectively). Nephrologists aged >65 were more likely (OR: 11.7; 95% CI: 
1.8-77.2) to recommend dialysis. Nephrologists were willing to forgo 12 months 
of patient survival to avoid substantial QOL decrease with dialysis.
CONCLUSION: Nephrologists avoided dialysis recommendation if it was expected to 
considerably reduce QOL. To inform elderly patients' dialysis decisions, 
systematic and longitudinal cognition and QOL evaluations are needed as well as 
better research into understanding patient preferences.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are ideally administered before 
HPV exposure; therefore, catch-up programs for girls past adolescence have not 
been readily funded. We evaluated the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a 
delayed, 1-year female catch-up vaccination program in Norway.
METHODS: We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and 
projected the costs and benefits associated with 8 HPV-related conditions while 
varying the upper vaccination age limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored 
the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV 
infections, vaccine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity.
RESULTS: The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper 
age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $150/dose, 
vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway's willingness-to-pay 
threshold (approximately $83 000/quality-adjusted life year gained); extension 
to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($50-$75). At high 
levels of vaccine protection in women with prior HPV exposure, vaccinating up to 
age 26 years was cost-effective. Results were stable with lower coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination catch-up programs, 5 years after routine 
implementation, may be warranted; however, even at low vaccine cost per dose, 
the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating beyond age 22 years remains uncertain.

OBJECTIVES: The fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis describes associations 
found for fetal or early-life exposures with cardiovascular risk and disease in 
adulthood. The extension or not of these associations into old age has received 
less attention. We investigated if maternal health and family circumstances were 
associated with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
late life and discuss results in light of possible selection effects and 
measurement error.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study based on community survey. We examined 224 
possible associations between anthropometric measures, maternal health 
information and family socioeconomic status at birth versus CVD and CVD-related 
risk factors 72-74 years later.
PARTICIPANTS: Of 3341 participants in a community survey of people aged 72-74 
years, we were able to trace birth records from a historical archive in a 
broadly representative subsample of 480.
SETTING: Bergen, Norway.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Established cardiovascular risk factors and indicators of 
CVD.
RESULTS: Only 11 (4.9%) of these associations were found to be statistically 
significant, and no strong or consistent patterns in the associations between 
exposures and outcomes were found.
CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence in this relatively elderly sample for an 
association between early life factors and CVD outcomes of clinical or public 
health relevance. Further research is required to confirm the extent to which a 
diminution of early life influences into old age, if genuine, can be accounted 
for by selective mortality, systematic bias or by dilution of effects due to 
competing risk factors.

857. Neurological, Psychiatric, and Developmental Disorders: Meeting the
Challenge in  the Developing World.

Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Nervous System Disorders in Developing 
Countries.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2001.

Brain disorders—neurological, psychiatric, and developmental—now affect at least 
250 million people in the developing world, and this number is expected to rise 
as life expectancy increases. Yet public and private health systems in 
developing countries have paid relatively little attention to brain disorders. 
The negative attitudes, prejudice, and stigma that often surround many of these 
disorders have contributed to this neglect. Lacking proper diagnosis and 
treatment, millions of individual lives are lost to disability and death. Such 
conditions exact both personal and economic costs on families, communities, and 
nations. The report describes the causes and risk factors associated with brain 
disorders. It focuses on six representative brain disorders that are prevalent 
in developing countries: developmental disabilities, epilepsy, schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, depression, and stroke. The report makes detailed 
recommendations of ways to reduce the toll exacted by these six disorders. In 
broader strokes, the report also proposes six major strategies toward reducing 
the overall burden of brain disorders in the developing world.

Treating glioblastoma in the elderly.

Universidad de Navarra, Av. Pío XII 36, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.

The incidence of glioblastoma (GBM) is increasing among the elderly, who now 
account for up to half of all the adult cases of GBM. This trend has resulted in 
the recent development of clinical research specifically dedicated to this 
fragile population. Some studies have investigated surgical resection, 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide, and ongoing research is 
currently addressing the use of combined radiochemotherapy in this population. 
Although older patients with GBM have a significantly worse life expectancy 
compared with their younger counterparts, etiologic treatments should not be 
withheld from these patients solely because of their age. On the contrary, 
results from prospective studies suggest that active care of these patients has 
a significant positive impact on survival without affecting quality of life or 
cognition. To optimize both symptomatic and etiologic treatment, neuro-oncology 
multidisciplinary teams must take into account performance and cognitive status, 
the resectability of the tumor, and associated comorbidities.

This study characterized life expectancy after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The 
TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database (NDB) was weighted to represent 
those ≥16 years of age completing inpatient rehabilitation for TBI in the United 
States (US) between 2001 and 2010. Analyses included Standardized Mortality 
Ratios (SMRs), Cox regression, and life expectancy. The US mortality rates by 
age, sex, race, and cause of death for 2005 and 2010 were used for comparison 
purposes. Results indicated that a total of 1325 deaths occurred in the weighted 
cohort of 6913 individuals. Individuals with TBI were 2.23 times more likely to 
die than individuals of comparable age, sex, and race in the general population, 
with a reduced average life expectancy of 9 years. Independent risk factors for 
death were: older age, male gender, less-than-high school education, previously 
married at injury, not employed at injury, more recent year of injury, 
fall-related TBI, not discharged home after rehabilitation, less functional 
independence, and greater disability. Individuals with TBI were at greatest risk 
of death from seizures; accidental poisonings; sepsis; aspiration pneumonia; 
respiratory, mental/behavioral, or nervous system conditions; and other external 
causes of injury and poisoning, compared with individuals in the general 
population of similar age, gender, and race. This study confirms prior life 
expectancy study findings, and provides evidence that the TBIMS NDB is 
representative of the larger population of adults receiving inpatient 
rehabilitation for TBI in the US. There is an increased risk of death for 
individuals with TBI requiring inpatient rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: One option for the palliative treatment of recurrent malignant 
pleural effusion is powdered talc using thoracoscopy. This paper presents the 
results of selected systemic and local manifestations of the talc-induced 
inflammatory reaction using a videothoracoscope.
METHOD: A total of 114 patients with repeated malignant pleural effusion were 
treated at the Cardiac Surgery Clinic in Hradec Kralove from January 2010 to 
December 2012. Those with a life expectancy more than ≥ 3 months were eligible 
for talcage surgery. The group was retrospectively divided according to 
treatment results into Group A (N1 = 98 - successful) and Group B (N2 = 16 - 
relapsing). The pleural effusion was quantified using ultrasound over 1 year at 
3-month intervals. Systemic changes due to the inflammatory reaction (body 
temperature, serum leukocyte and CRP levels) were evaluated. Local indicators of 
inflammation included changes in the leukocyte cell population in the effusion 
and changes in the pleural CRP levels. The dynamics of local expression of 
membrane receptors TLR-2 and CD-64 on granulocyte and monocyte cell populations 
in the pleural effusion were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The reaction after talcage, included a significant increase in axillary 
temperature and leukocyte count, 12 h after the procedure. The dynamics were 
different in the two groups. The dynamics of local inflammatory changes were an 
early increase in the pleural CRP levels in both groups. The time interval of 
local inflammatory development and duration was related to the treatment 
efficacy and showed a significant rise 2 h after talcage in Group A. In Group B
