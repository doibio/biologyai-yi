Aquaculture effluent treatment is essential to eliminate the undesirable 
characteristics of water to ensure cleaner production and environmental 
sustainability. In an effort to develop green coagulant without compromising 
cost, this research investigated the feasibility of aquaculture effluent (AQEF) 
pollutant removal using Picralima nitida seeds extract (PNSC) and its 
bio-coagulation/adsorption kinetic characteristics with the substrate in water. 
The coagulative decrease was observed in terms of TD (turbidity), TSS (total 
suspended solids), COD (chemical oxygen demand), BOD (biochemical oxygen 
demand), and COLR (color) from AQEF. The active coagulant was extracted from the 
seeds and analyzed for its spectral and morphological characteristics through 
FTIR and SEM. The influence of PNSC dosage (0.10-0.50 g L-1), pH (2-10), 
settling time (0-60 min), and temperature (303-323 K) on the removal of 
contaminants were surveyed. The process kinetics of coagulation-flocculation 
were also explored. Maximal TD reduction of 90.35%, COD (82.11%), BOD (82.38%); 
TSS (88.84%), and COLR (65.77%) at 0.2 g PNSC L-1, pH 4, and 303 K was achieved. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests proved that pH, temperature, and settling 
time had a significant effect on pollutant removal. Results fitted Von 
Smoluchowski's perikinetics theory at the optimum conditions, which gave 
R2 > 0.900. At perikinetics circumstances, the Kb (reaction rate) and [Formula: 
see text] (half-life) correspond to 0.0635 Lg-1 min-1 and 1.9 min. More so, 
sorption results fitted the Lagergren over the Ho model. Additionally, the net 
cost of using PNSC to handle 1 L of AQEF (including electricity, material, and 
labor costs) was evaluated to be €4.81. Overall, the PNSC appears reliable and 
useful in pretreating AQEF for improved biodegradability and superior effluent 
quality.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence of cost-effective primary prevention 
interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young women. This study aimed 
to assess the value for money of primary prevention of CVD in this population.
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model consisting of both first-ever and 
recurrent CVD events was developed to simulate the lifetime intervention impact 
on cost and health outcomes in women of premenopausal age (30 to 54 years) from 
the Australian healthcare system perspective. The latest wave of the Australian 
National Health Survey defined the modelled population's characteristics. The 
intervention effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program involving changes 
in diet and physical activity demonstrated to be effective in this population 
was sourced from a systematic review and meta-analysis. The first-ever and 
recurrent CVD probabilities were derived from the CVD risk calculators 
accounting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Costs and utility 
weights associated with CVD events and long-term management post-CVD were 
informed by national statistics/published literature. Sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken to examine the robustness of base case results.
RESULTS: The lifestyle modification program was associated with both higher 
costs and benefits (in terms of quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) as a primary 
prevention measure of CVD in premenopausal women, with an ICER of $96,377/QALY 
or $130,469/LY. The intervention led to fewer first-ever (N = -19) and recurrent 
CVD events (N = -23) per 10,000 women over the modelled life horizon. The 
avoided cost due to reduced hospitalisations (-$24) and management (-$164) of 
CVD could partially offset the cost associated with the intervention ($1560). 
Sensitivity analysis indicated that time horizon, starting age of the 
intervention, discount rate, and intervention effectiveness were the key drivers 
of the results. If the intervention was scaled up to the national level 
(N = 502,095 at-risk premenopausal women), the total intervention cost would be 
$794 million with $95 million in healthcare cost-savings.
CONCLUSION: Offering a lifestyle modification program to premenopausal women in 
Australia as primary prevention of CVD is not cost-effective from a healthcare 
system perspective. We should continue to search for new or adapt/optimise 
existing effective and cost-effective primary prevention measures of CVD for 
women.

The improvement of dialysis therapy and clinical support has increased the life 
expectancy of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) over the last years. 
However, in Brazil, the renal transplant rate cannot follow this growth. This 
fact, in association with the unavailability of adequate healthcare services in 
the country, substantially enlarges the use of dual lumen catheters and, 
consequently, access-related complications. The result is a high rate of 
patients with access failure, which brings a challenge: how to maintain dialysis 
in this group? This case report describes a non-conventional surgical approach 
to create a definite access using abdominal vessels, in an end stage vascular 
access patient.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the spatiotemporal trends in disease burden of 
edentulism is critical to reducing disease burden of edentulism and deploying 
medical resources. We assessed the changing patterns of disease burden of 
edentulism at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on incident cases, prevalent cases, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of edentulism were extracted from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study. We calculated the estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) to quantify spatiotemporal trends in the ASRs of 
edentulism.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of prevalent cases and DALYs of edentulism were 
35.2 and 9.6 million, and the ASPR and ASDR were 43.12/1,000 and 1.18/1,000, 
with EAPCs of -0.18 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.28, -0.09] and -0.16[95% 
CI: -0.26, -0.07] from 1990 to 2019, respectively. Females and the elderly had a 
higher burden of edentulism. Although the ASPR, ASDR, and ASIR in the high SDI, 
high-middle SDI, and middle SDI regions showed a decreasing or stable trend, the 
absolute disease burdens of edentulism in these regions were still high. 
Although the absolute disease burdens of low SDI and low-middle SDI were low, 
their ASPR and ASDR showed an upward trend. In countries with high initial 
disease burden or high SDI, ASPR, ASDR, and ASIR showed stable or declining 
trends.
CONCLUSION: The absolute disease burden due to edentulism was increasing in many 
countries and regions. Countries should reduce the disease burden caused by 
edentulism by adopting measures including the prevention and treatment of dental 
caries and periodontal disease.

Impaired semen quality is present in approximately 50% of all infertile couples, 
indicating decreased fertility in the male. The etiology is unknown in 40-60% of 
the cases and standard semen parameters provide limited information about the 
cause and the chance for pregnancy in vivo or in vitro. Assessment of sperm DNA 
strand breaks may therefore be useful for optimal infertility treatment. Since 
the causes of infertility of the male part are largely unknown, few options for 
treatment of decreased semen quality are at hand. This applies to 
pharmacological and surgical methods as well as lifestyle related interventions. 
There are studies showing that infertile men have a significant risk of 
hypogonadism and shorter life expectancy due to higher risk of cardiovascular 
and metabolic diseases as well as certain cancers. Poor fertility can hence be 
considered as an early marker of general disease. Andrological examination, not 
only limited to semen analysis, but also including clinical, endocrinological 
and in some cases genetic evaluation should  be part of the routine work-up of 
infertile couples.

OBJECTIVES: The colorectal cancer (CRC) burden is increasingly high. The aim of 
this study was to investigate temporal and geographical trends in CRC deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to diet low in fiber 
globally from 1990 to 2019.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: The study based on the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019.
PARTICIPANTS: The population comprised individuals from 204 countries and 
territories who were diagnosed with CRC attributable to diet low in fiber from 
1990 to 2019.
MEASUREMENTS: Deaths, DALYs, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), and 
age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) for CRC attributable to diet low in fiber 
were described, and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was further 
calculated to assess the burden in different regions, countries, sexes, and age 
groups. Additionally, we explored the association between EAPC and ASMR/ASDR (in 
1990) and Human Development Index (HDI, in 2019).
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, global ASMR and ASDR for CRC attributable to diet 
low in fiber decreased slightly, but the corresponding deaths and DALYs 
increased by 63.37% and 51.36%, respectively. Those burden varied considerably 
between regions and countries. The burden was higher in high, high-middle and 
middle SDI regions, especially in Asia and Western Europe, but when HDI > 0.7, 
an increasingly rapid decline in ASMR and ASDR was revealed. Unexpectedly, many 
less well-developed countries within the traditionally low deaths and DALYs 
regions of Africa, Central Latin America, and Middle East showed gradual 
increases in ASMR and ASDR.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of CRC attributable to diet low in fiber has 
decreased over the last 30 years, but remains at a high level. It is essential 
for decision-makers to take targeted measures for improving population awareness 
and intake of dietary fiber.

USA.

Background: In the United States, the number of older adults reporting 
non-medical use of prescription pain relievers (NMUPPR) between 2015 and 2019 
has remained constant, while those meeting criteria for opioid use disorders 
(OUDs) between 2013 and 2018 increased three-fold. These rates are expected to 
increase due to increased life expectancy among this population coupled with 
higher rates of substance use. However, they have consistently lower screening 
rates for problematic prescription pain reliever use, compared to younger 
cohorts. Objectives: This commentary reviewed trends in older adult NMUPPR and 
OUDs and reviewed several available screening tools. We then considered reasons 
why providers may not be screening their patients, with a focus on older adults, 
for NMUPPR and OUDs. Finally, we provided recommendations to increase screenings 
in healthcare settings. Results: Low screening rates in older adult patients may 
be due to several contributing factors, such as providers' implicit biases and 
lack of training, time constraints, and comorbid conditions that mask NMUPPR and 
OUD-related symptoms. Recommendations include incorporating more 
addiction-related curricula in medical schools, encouraging participation in CME 
training focused on substance use, attending implicit bias training, and 
breaking down the silos between pharmacy and geriatric, addiction, and family 
medicine. Conclusions: There is a growing need for older adult drug screenings, 
and we have provided several recommendations for improvement. By increasing 
screenings among older populations, providers will assist in the identification 
and referral of patients to appropriate and timely substance use treatment and 
resources to ultimately ameliorate the health of older adult patients.

BACKGROUND: It is essential to deliver specialist human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) care with maximum effectiveness, but also minimum time delay. Therefore, 
we aimed to determine whether rapid linkage to care defined as starting combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) on the day of the first visit at the HIV clinic is 
a costeffective approach.
METHODS: In the analysis, Markov's lifetime model presented in our previous 
study was implemented. The inputs used in the model were updated in the terms of 
costs, life expectancy, and patient characteristics. For the analysis we used 
information from the previous model about the additional costs of treatment and 
qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) lost in the life horizon for people newly 
infected with HIV. The number of newly infected persons was estimated based on 
available data.
RESULTS: Input data was available for 344 men having sex with men (MSM) who 
registered in the HIV specialist care between 2016 and 2017. The estimated QALY 
loss due to lack of rapid treatment initiation, where the viral load is not 
(was) taken into account, equals 0·018 (0·022), 0·039 (0·047), 0·131 (0·158) 
respectively in low, medium and high risk transmission groups. Rapid cART 
initiation was dominant regardless of the chosen scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis considering the HIV transmission 
indicates that the rapid initiation of HIV treatment is a cost-effective and 
potentially cost-saving approach to improve HIV care and reduce HIV transmission 
in Central and Eastern Europe.

BACKGROUND: Asia accounts for the largest burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
worldwide. This study examines the temporal patterns of CRC in Asia in the last 
three decades.
METHODS: The data pertaining to CRC burden measured by incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) and its risk factors for 49 countries in 
the Asian continent were drawn from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study 
between 1990 and 2019. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was employed as a 
proxy indicator of 5-year survival rates.
RESULTS: In Asia, incident cases more than tripled from 270,851 to 1.1 million, 
deaths tripled from 183,252 to 560,426, and DALYs more than doubled from 5 
million to 13.4 million between 1990 and 2019. The age-standardized incidence 
rate (ASIR) increased from 14.0/100,000 to 23.9/100,000, age-standardized 
mortality rate (ASMR) increased from 10.1/100,000 to 12.5/100,000, and MIR 
decreased from 0.68 to 0.50 between 1990 and 2019. ASIR varied 10-folds across 
countries from 5.6/100,000 in Bangladesh to 62.0/100,000 in Taiwan in 2019 and 
ASMR from 4.9/1000 in Bangladesh to 30.3/100,000 in Brunei. In 2019, diet low in 
milk (18.7%) and whole grains (15.2%) and calcium (16.6%) were the major 
contributory risk factors in CRC DALYs in 2019.
CONCLUSION: CRC is a fast-rising neoplasm in Asia and its burden can be 
curtailed by focusing on primary prevention (e.g., diet and physical activity) 
and secondary prevention through screening. The policy focus and resources must 
be directed towards capacity building, including cancer infrastructure and 
quality data availability from cancer registries.

Post-stroke sequelae includes loss functions, such as cognitive and 
sensory-motor which lead to emotional and social problems, reducing quality of 
life and well-being. The main aim of our study was to investigate the effects of 
transcranial laser photobiomodulation together with neuromuscular electrical 
stimulation (NMES) in post-stroke patients. We performed a clinical trial and an 
ex vivo study. For the clinical trial, hemiplegic patients were separated into 
two groups: Treated Group (TG): Hemiplegics treated with transcranial laser (on) 
associated with NMES (on) and; Placebo Group (PG): Hemiplegics treated with 
placebo transcranial laser (off) associated with NMES (on). The cluster 
prototype includes 12 diode laser beams (4 × 660 nm, 4 × 808 nm and 4 × 980 nm) 
with average power of 720 mW per cluster applied during one minute, leading to 
43.2 J energy per cluster. Fifteen regions for all head were irradiated by 
cluster, leading to 648 J energy per session. The parameters of NMES of the 
paretic limbs to generate extension wrist and ankle dorsiflexion were 
symmetrical biphasic rectangular waveforms, 50 Hz frequency, 250 μs pulse 
duration, and adjustable intensity to maintain the maximum range of motion 
(amplitude between 0 and 150 mA). Our clinical trial showed improvement of 
cognitive function, pain relief, greater manual dexterity, enhancement of 
physical and social-emotional health which lead to better quality of life and 
well-being. There was also increased temperature in the treated regions with 
laser and NMES. For the ex vivo study, the distribution of infrared and red 
radiation after penetration through the cranium and hemihead of cadavers were 
showed. Therefore, transcranial laser photobiomodulation associated with NMES 
can be an important therapeutic resource for rehabilitation after stroke.

Failure is an integral part of life and by extension academia. At the same time, 
failure is often ignored, with potentially negative consequences both for the 
science and the scientists involved. This article provides several strategies 
for learning from and dealing with failure instead of ignoring it. Hopefully, 
our recommendations are widely applicable, while still taking into account 
individual differences between academics. These simple rules allow academics to 
further develop their own strategies for failing successfully in academia.

Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to map the methodological 
variations and population characteristics of the studies that report normative 
data for accommodation and vergence parameters.
INTRODUCTION: Accommodation and vergence are the two important parameters 
required for normal binocular vision. The presence of accommodation and vergence 
anomalies impairs the quality of life of an individual by interfering with their 
daily visual activities. Diagnosis of accommodative and vergence anomalies 
requires a series of test procedures. The test procedure or the tool used could 
influence the outcome measured. Different study designs and methods have been 
used to estimate the normative data; therefore, we aim to explore the variation 
in terms of population characteristics and methods used to measure accommodative 
and vergence parameters.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will include published literature that 
assesses normative function of various binocular vision parameters with a focus 
on mapping the methodological differences.
METHODOLOGY: JBI methodological framework for scoping reviews will be followed. 
The review will also be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 
Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Three-phase searches for identifying relevant articles 
will be conducted in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, 
Web of Science, African Journals Online, LILACS, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, and Google Scholar. The review undertakes two stages of 
screening: i) title/abstract screening and ii) full-text screening. The data 
will be extracted from the retrieved full text. The results will be tabulated 
and summarized descriptively.

Hospital, New Zealand; Faculty of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.

AIM: To ascertain if endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 
the elderly is associated with an increased risk of complications.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 509 consecutive ERCPs on 338 patients in one 
year (2019-2020). Patients were categorised as >75 years old (elderly test 
group) or ≤75 (controls). The primary outcome was ERCP complications. Secondary 
outcomes were the length of hospital stay after complications, intensive care 
admissions, and all-cause mortality at 30 and 90 days.
RESULTS: Forty-four complications occurred in a group of 42 (8%) patients; 11 
(2%) were severe, including four deaths. The most common complication was 
pancreatitis n=33 (6%). There was no difference in complication rates between 
the elderly and younger controls. Length of stay after complications was similar 
(median five versus four days; p=0.354). All-cause mortality was higher in the 
elderly at 30-days (8.5% versus 2%; p=0.002) and 90-days (19.7% versus 6.9%; 
p=0.001), mostly attributed to malignancy. Logistic analysis showed that neither 
age >75 years nor Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ≥5 was associated with 
post-ERCP pancreatitis, but a CCI≥5 strongly increased the odds of death at 
90-days (AOR=74.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.78- 566.38, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: ERCP is relatively safe in elderly patients, but comorbidities 
should be considered to avoid subjecting vulnerable individuals with a short 
life expectancy to unnecessary procedures.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are reported and to 
assess the quality of reporting PROs for elderly patients with a hip fracture in 
both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase and CENTRAL were searched on 1 March 2013 to 25 
May 2021.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: RCTs and observational studies on geriatric (≥65 years of 
age) patients, with one or more PRO as outcome were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Primary outcome was type of PRO; secondary 
outcome and quality assessment was measured by adherence to the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for patient-reported outcomes 
(CONSORT-PRO). Because of heterogeneity in study population and outcomes, data 
pooling was not possible.
RESULTS: 3659 studies were found in the initial search. Of those, 67 were 
included in the final analysis. 83.6% of studies did not adequately mention 
missing data, 52.3% did not correctly report how PROs were collected and 61.2% 
did not report adequate effect size. PRO limitations were adequately reported in 
20.9% of studies and interpretation of PROs was adequately reported in 19.4% of 
studies. Most Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes were measured by the EuroQol 
5-Dimension 3-Levels, and pain as well as patient satisfaction by Visual 
Analogue Scale.
CONCLUSION: This study found that a high variety of PRO measures are used to 
evaluate geriatric hip fracture care. In addition, 47.8% of studies examining 
PROs in elderly patients with hip fracture do not satisfy at least 50% of the 
CONSORT-PRO criteria. This enables poorly conducted research to be published and 
used in evidence-based medicine and, consequently, shared decision-making. More 
efforts should be undertaken to improve adequate reporting. We believe extending 
the CONSORT-PRO extension to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational 
Studies in Epidemiology for observational studies would be a valuable addition 
to current guidelines.

We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), 13-valent pneumococcal conjunctive 
vaccine (PCV13), and PCV13-PPSV23 sequential vaccination strategies in 
preventing pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases among the senior citizens 
(≥ 65 years) in China. The cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines compared 
to no vaccination was estimated using a decision-tree Markov model from a 
societal perspective. Parameters including epidemiological data, vaccine 
efficacy and cost data were obtained from previous studies. Cases and deaths 
averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as outcomes. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to explore the uncertainty in the model. In the 
base-case analysis, compared with no pneumococcal vaccination, the ICERs of 
PPSV23, PCV13 and PCV13-PPSV23 are US$10,776.7/QALY, $9,193.2/QALY, and 
$15,080.0/QALY, respectively. PCV13 is the most cost-effective strategy and the 
only cost-effective strategy based on a threshold of the one-time national GDP 
per capita, whereas PPSV23 vaccine strategy is provided with the lowest cost, 
and PCV13-PPSV23 demonstrates the greatest impact on pneumococcal disease 
burden. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the results are greatly influenced by 
serotype coverage, vaccine efficacy, CAP incidence and vaccine prices. The PCV13 
vaccination for Chinese seniors is more cost-effective than PPSV23 vaccination 
and PCV13-PPSV23 sequential vaccination.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Although usually benign, varicella can lead to serious 
complications and sometimes long-term sequelae. Vaccines are safe and effective 
but not yet included in immunisation programmes in many countries. We aimed to 
quantify the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in children with varicella and their 
families, key to assessing cost-utility in countries with low mortality due to 
this infection.
METHODS: Children with varicella in the community and admitted to hospitals in 
Portugal were included over 18 months from January 2019. Children's and carers' 
HRQoL losses were assessed prospectively using standard multi-attribute utility 
instruments for measuring HRQoL (EQ-5D and CHU9D), from presentation to 
recovery, allowing the calculation of QALYs.
RESULTS: Among 109 families with children with varicella recruited from 
attendees at a pediatric emergency service (community arm), the mean HRQoL 
loss/child was 2.0 days (95 % CI 1.9-2.2, n = 101) (mean 5.4 QALYs/1000 children 
(95 % CI 5.3-6.1) and 1.3 days/primary carer (95 % CI 1.2-1.6, n = 103) (mean 
3.6 QALYs /1000 carers (95 % CI 3.4-4.4). Among 114 families with children 
admitted to hospital because of severe varicella or a complication (hospital 
arm), the mean HRQoL loss/child was 9.8 days (95 % CI 9.4-10.6, n = 114) (mean 
26.8 QALYs /1000 children (95 % CI 25.8-29.0) and 8.5 days/primary carer (95 % 
CI 7.4-9.6, n = 114) (mean 23.4 QALYs/1000 carers (95 % CI 20.3-26.2). Mean QALY 
losses/1000 patients were particularly high for bone and joint infections [67.5 
(95 % CI 43.9-97.6)]. Estimates for children's QALYs lost using the CHU9D tool 
were well correlated with those obtained using EQ-5D, but substantially lower.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of varicella on HRQoL is substantial. We report the 
first measurements of QALYs lost in hospitalised children and in the families of 
children both in the community and admitted to hospital, providing important 
information to guide vaccination policy recommendations.

Aging is a gradual and irreversible pathophysiological process. It presents with 
declines in tissue and cell functions and significant increases in the risks of 
various aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, 
cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and 
immune system diseases. Although the development of modern medicine has promoted 
human health and greatly extended life expectancy, with the aging of society, a 
variety of chronic diseases have gradually become the most important causes of 
disability and death in elderly individuals. Current research on aging focuses 
on elucidating how various endogenous and exogenous stresses (such as genomic 
instability, telomere dysfunction, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, 
compromise of autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem 
cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, deregulated nutrient 
sensing) participate in the regulation of aging. Furthermore, thorough research 
on the pathogenesis of aging to identify interventions that promote health and 
longevity (such as caloric restriction, microbiota transplantation, and 
nutritional intervention) and clinical treatment methods for aging-related 
diseases (depletion of senescent cells, stem cell therapy, antioxidative and 
anti-inflammatory treatments, and hormone replacement therapy) could decrease 
the incidence and development of aging-related diseases and in turn promote 
healthy aging and longevity.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is often seen as the first 
choice treatment for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), particularly 
high-risk patients, yet the long-term survival rate and improvement in quality 
of life are still unclear. In order to seek the value of EVAR to the entire 
healthcare field, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate whether the 
improvement EVAR can truly bring to the quality of medical care in the era of 
value-based healthcare.
METHODS: We included AAA patients who underwent surgical treatment in the 
Department of Vascular Surgery, First Hospital of China Medical University, from 
January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2019 and evaluated surgery procedure data, 
short-term and long-term mortality, complications, prognoses, and medical costs.
RESULTS: We analyzed 507 patients with AAA who underwent open repair (n = 232) 
or EVAR (n = 275) over a 15-year period. The operative time, blood loss, blood 
transfusion rate, and postoperative length of hospital stay of the EVAR group is 
significantly lower than which of the open repair group. Meanwhile, neither 
short-term nor long-term mortality rates shows significant differences between 
the two groups. On the other hand, the complication rate of the EVAR group was 
significantly higher than that of the open repair group. Lastly, the total cost 
of EVAR was significantly higher than that of open repair.
CONCLUSION: Existing evidence suggests that EVAR improves neither short-term nor 
long-term survival rate compared with open surgery. In contrast, the 
complication rate and the reintervention rate in the EVAR group were higher than 
those in the open surgery group. Moreover, the cost of EVAR and that paid by 
medical insurance were higher than those for open surgery. For patients with a 
long-life expectancy, in order to ensure that patients receive appropriate and 
effective care, surgeons should choose a suitable method that considers both the 
quality of medical care as well as the expense accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders are a major and increasing global health 
challenge, which accounts for a substantial portion of the disease burden 
worldwide. The aim of this systematic analysis is to present the most 
comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of disease burden, epidemiological 
trends, and attributable risk factors of neurological disorders at global, 
regional, and national levels.
METHODS: We extracted data of 18 neurological disorders from the Global Burden 
of Disease 2019 study database. The burden of neurological disorders was 
measured using the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), and further described according to age, sex, year, 
geographical location and socio-demographic Index (SDI). All estimates were 
presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, there were nearly 10 million deaths and 349 million 
DALYs due to neurological disorders. Among the 18 neurological disorders, stroke 
was the biggest contributor to DALYs (143232.18 [95%UI 133095.81-153241.82] in 
thousands) and deaths (6552.72 [95%UI 5995.20-7015.14] in thousands), followed 
by neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. From 1990 to 2019, 
the DALYs of neurological diseases belonging to the communicable, maternal, 
neonatal and nutritional categories showed a sharp decrease, while Alzheimer's 
disease and other dementias and Parkinson's disease showed a large increase. 
Neurological disorders exhibited different profiles in different regions and age 
groups. A significant correlation between the SDI and the age-standardized DALY 
rates was also found except for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In 
addition, risk factors such as high systolic blood pressure, low birth weight 
and short gestation period, and metabolic risk contribute significantly to 
neurological disorders.
INTERPRETATION: The overall burden of neurological disorders has increased from 
1990 to 2019, especially for non-communicable neurological disorders. The 
substantial variations of burden across regions emphasize the need for 
region-specific interventional strategies and allocation of resources based on 
priorities.
