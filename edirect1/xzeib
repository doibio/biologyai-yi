SCI, falls were the leading cause in 97% (198/204) of countries/territories, 
followed by conflict and terrorism (3%, 6/204).
CONCLUSIONS: Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI have decreased 
significantly since 1990, whereas SCI had no significant change. The leading 
causes of TBI/SCI globally were falls, but variations did exist between 
countries/territories. Policy-makers should continue to prioritise interventions 
to reduce falls, but priorities may vary between countries/territories.

INTRODUCTION: Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare 
disease with symptoms including movement disorders, developmental delays, and 
autonomic symptoms starting from birth; further, patients with AADC deficiency 
are at a high risk of death in the first decade of life. Limited information on 
the impact of treatment with gene therapy on patients' disease trajectories and 
survival, quality-of-life, and resource usage benefits are available.
METHOD: A cohort-based model with a lifetime horizon has been developed, based 
on motor milestones, to estimate the long-term benefits for patients after 
treatment with eladocagene exuparvovec compared to best supportive care (BSC). 
The model takes a National Health Service (NHS) perspective using a UK setting. 
The model comprises two parts: the developmental phase, in which patients with 
initially no motor function can progress to other motor milestone states, and a 
long-term projection phase. Efficacy for eladocagene exuparvovec is derived from 
clinical trial data with a duration up to 120 months. As the incidence of AADC 
deficiency is low, data for key model inputs is lacking; therefore estimates of 
survival by motor milestone were based on proxy diseases. A disease-specific 
utility study provided quality of life inputs and a burden of illness study 
informed inputs for disease management.
RESULTS: The model indicates survival (25.25 undiscounted life years gained) and 
quality-of-life benefits (20.21 undiscounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] 
gained) for patients treated with eladocagene exuparvovec compared to BSC. 
Resource usage costs are greater for patients treated with eladocagene 
exuparvovec, mainly due to the increased life expectancy during which patients 
accrue additional healthcare resource usage. Scenario analyses indicate robust 
results.
CONCLUSION: This study assessed long-term outcomes for patients with AADC 
deficiency. Patients treated with eladocagene exuparvovec were found to have 
improved survival and quality of life benefits compared to patients treated with 
BSC.

BACKGROUND: Increasing expectancy of life and levels of activity in the growing 
geriatric population lead to a rising number of prosthetic implants of the hip 
and consequently the incidence of periprosthetic fractures of the femur 
increase. The fracture pattern and the possible instability of the stem are a 
challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon. Treatment options are complete replacement 
of the implant or a solitary osteosynthesis. The goal of this study was to 
analyse the feasibility of the operative intervention using a contralateral 
reversed anatomic distal femoral LISS® locking plate and the radiological and 
functional outcome in a geriatric cohort.
METHODS: We included all patients older than 75 years of age with a Vancouver 
type B fracture, which have been treated by osteosynthesis using a LISS® 
(contralateral reversed) plate in our institution in an interdisciplinary 
ortho-geriatric setting between 7/2013 and 12/2021. Perioperative morbidities, 
clinical and radiological outcome during follow-up were retrospectively 
analysed.
RESULTS: During the observed time period, 83 patients (mean age: 88 years 
(range: 76-103), male/female: 26/57) were treated. Most fractures were Vancouver 
type B2 (n = 45, 54%) followed by B1 (n = 20, 24%) and B3 (n = 18, 22%). The 
most prevalent postoperative surgical complication was anaemia (n = 73, 88%) 
followed by infections (n = 12, 14%, urinary infections, pneumonia) and 
cardiovascular decompensation (n = 8, 10%). Clinical and radiological follow up 
6-8 weeks postoperative was possible for 59 patients (70%). The majority of them 
did not describe pain (n = 50, 85%) and had a good or excellent radiological 
outcome. Three cases needed revision surgery due to infection and another three 
due to non-union, loosening of the stem or an additional fracture. 1-year 
mortality was 30%.
CONCLUSION: We are convinced that the reversed contralateral LISS-plate is an 
easy-to-use implant with a small complication rate but a very successful and 
high healing rate in a geriatric, polymorbid cohort.

The rising global life expectancy has underlined the necessity of designing 
novel and tasty food products, suitable for seniors and people with impaired 
oral and swallowing functions. For developing these products, texture should be 
optimised from rheological, colloidal, tribological, and masticatory points of 
view. The current review provides an overview of different studies based on 
shear rheological, tribological, and in vitro mastication properties of model or 
real food systems intended for the elderly and/or people with swallowing 
dysfunctions, with special emphasis on the relation between the instrumental 
measurements and sensory perceptions of foods. Several works demonstrated that 
instrumental data from shear rheological and tribological tests complement the 
sensory evaluations of foods, providing useful information when designing food 
commodities for specific populations. Conversely, only few works correlated the 
instrumental data obtained from artificial mouths and/or simulated masticators 
with the sensory attributes generated by trained assessors. Broaden knowledge of 
these topics will help in formulating and adapting foods with enhanced 
functionalities for people with impaired oral and swallowing capabilities. Shear 
rheology, soft oral tribology, and simulated mastication tests are crucial in 
designing safe- and easy-swallowing food products.

INTRODUCTION: When performing an exercise or a functional test, pain that is 
evoked by movement or muscle contraction could be a stronger stimulus for 
changing how individuals move compared to tonic pain. We investigated whether 
the decrease in muscle force production is larger when experimentally-induced 
knee pain is directly associated to the torque produced (movement-evoked) 
compared to a constant painful stimulation (tonic).
METHODS: Twenty-one participants performed three isometric knee extension 
maximal voluntary contractions without pain (baseline), during pain, and after 
pain. Knee pain was induced using sinusoidal electrical stimuli at 10 Hz over 
the infrapatellar fat pad, applied continuously or modulated proportionally to 
the knee extension torque. Peak torque and contraction duration were averaged 
across repetitions and normalized to baseline.
RESULTS: During tonic pain, participants reported lower pain intensity during 
the contraction than at rest (p < 0.001), whereas pain intensity increased with 
contraction during movement-evoked pain (p < 0.001). Knee extension torque 
decreased during both pain conditions (p < 0.001), but a larger reduction was 
observed during movement-evoked compared to tonic pain (p < 0.001). Participants 
produced torque for longer during tonic compared to movement-evoked pain 
(p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that movement-evoked pain was a more potent 
stimulus to reduce knee extension torque than tonic pain. The longer contraction 
time observed during tonic pain may be a result of a lower perceived pain 
intensity during muscle contraction. Overall, our results suggest different 
motor adaptation to tonic and movement-evoked pain and support the notion that 
motor adaptation to pain is a purposeful strategy to limit pain. This 
mechanistic evidence suggests that individuals experiencing prevalently tonic or 
movement-evoked pain may exhibit different motor adaptations, which may be 
important for exercise prescription.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle and longevity genes have different and important roles in 
the human lifespan; however, the association between a healthy lifestyle in 
late-life and life expectancy mediated by genetic risk is yet to be elucidated. 
We aimed to investigate the associations of healthy lifestyle in late-life and 
genetic risk with life expectancy among older adults.
METHODS: A weighted healthy lifestyle score was constructed from the following 
variables: current non-smoking, non-harmful alcohol consumption, regular 
physical activity, and a healthy diet. Participants were recruited from the 
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, a prospective community-based 
cohort study that took place between 1998 and 2018. Eligible participants were 
aged 65 years and older with available information on lifestyle factors at 
baseline, and then were categorised into unhealthy (bottom tertile of the 
weighted healthy lifestyle score), intermediate (middle tertile), and healthy 
(top tertile) lifestyle groups. A genetic risk score was constructed based on 11 
lifespan loci among 9633 participants, divided by the median and classified into 
low and high genetic risk groups. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression 
was used to estimate the interaction between genetic and lifestyle factors on 
all-cause mortality risk.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 1998, and Dec 31, 2018, 36 164 adults aged 65 years 
and older were recruited, among whom a total of 27 462 deaths were documented 
during a median follow-up of 3·12 years (IQR 1·62-5·94) and included in the 
lifestyle association analysis. Compared with the unhealthy lifestyle category, 
participants in the healthy lifestyle group had a lower all-cause mortality risk 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0·56 [95% CI 0·54-0·57]; p<0·0001). The highest mortality 
risk was observed in individuals in the high genetic risk and unhealthy 
lifestyle group (HR 1·80 [95% CI 1·63-1·98]; p<0·0001). The absolute risk 
reduction was greater for participants in the high genetic risk group. A healthy 
lifestyle was associated with a gain of 3·84 years (95% CI 3·05-4·64) at the age 
of 65 years in the low genetic risk group, and 4·35 years (3·70-5·06) in the 
high genetic risk group.
INTERPRETATION: A healthy lifestyle, even in late-life, was associated with 
lower mortality risk and longer life expectancy among Chinese older adults, 
highlighting the importance of a healthy lifestyle in extending the lifespan, 
especially for individuals with high genetic risk.

BACKGROUND: Those with self-inflicted burns are a small but consistent group 
among burn patients, with large injuries and conflicting findings regarding 
their in-hospital mortality. Overall, burn survivors have a shorter life 
expectancy, as compared with national controls, but long-term mortality after 
self-inflicted burns is understudied. The aim of this retrospective study was to 
investigate possible differences in long-term mortality among survivors after 
self-inflicted and accidental burns.
METHODS: All adult patients with burns admitted at the Linköping Burn Centre and 
discharged alive between 2000 and 2017 were included, and end of follow up was 
April 26, 2021. Those with unknown survival status at that time were excluded. A 
Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusted for age and sex, was used to 
analyse long term mortality.
RESULTS: Among the 930 patients included in this study, 37 had self-inflicted 
burns. Overall, median follow up period was 8.8 years and crude mortality was 
24.7%. After adjustment for age and sex, self-inflicted burns were independently 
associated with long-term mortality, Hazard Ratio= 2.08 (95% CI 1.13-3.83). Post 
hoc analysis showed that the effect was most pronounced during the first years 
after discharge although it was noticeable over the whole study period.
CONCLUSION: Long-term risk of mortality after discharge from a burn centre was 
higher in patients with self-inflicted burns than in patients with accidental 
burns. The effect was noticeable over the whole study period although it was 
most pronounced during the first years after discharge.

Cereal/legume intercropping is becoming a popular production strategy for higher 
crop yields and net profits with reduced inputs and environmental impact. 
However, the effects of different spatial arrangements on the growth, grain 
yield, nitrogen uptake, and land-use advantage of wheat/soybean relay 
intercropping are still unclear, particularly under arid irrigated conditions. 
Therefore, in a three-year field study from 2018 to 2021, soybean was relay 
intercropped with wheat in different crop configurations (0.9 m, narrow strips; 
1.8 m, medium strips; and 2.7 m, wide strips), and the results of intercropping 
systems were compared with their sole systems. Results revealed that intercrops 
with wide strips outperformed the narrow and medium strips, when the objective 
was to obtain higher total leaf area, dry matter, nitrogen uptake, and grain 
yield on a given land area due to reduced interspecific competition between 
intercrops. Specifically, at maturity, wide strips increased the dry matter 
accumulation (37% and 58%) and its distribution in roots (37% and 55%), straw 
(40% and 61%), and grains (30% and 46%) of wheat and soybean, respectively, 
compared to narrow strips. This enhanced dry matter in wide strips improved the 
soybean's competitive ability (by 17%) but reduced the wheat's competitive 
ability (by 12%) compared with narrow strips. Noticeably, all intercropping 
systems accumulated a significantly higher amount of nitrogen than sole systems, 
revealing that wheat/soybean relay intercropping requires fewer anthropogenic 
inputs (nitrogen) and exerts less pressure on the ecosystem than sole systems. 
Overall, in wide strips, intercropped wheat and soybean achieved 62% and 71% of 
sole wheat and soybean yield, respectively, which increased the greater total 
system yield (by 19%), total land equivalent ratio (by 24%), and net profit (by 
34%) of wide strips compared to narrow strips. Our study, therefore, implies 
that the growth parameters, grain yields, nutrient accumulation, and land-use 
advantage of intercrop species could be improved with the proper spatial 
arrangement in cereal/legume intercropping systems.

High environment ammonia (HEA) poses a deadly threat to aquatic animals and 
indirectly impacts human healthy life, while nutritional regulation can 
alleviate chronic ammonia toxicity. α-lipoic acid exhibits antioxidative effects 
in both aqueous and lipid environments, mitigating cellular and tissue damage 
caused by oxidative stress by aiding in the neutralization of free radicals 
(reactive oxygen species). Hence, investigating its potential as an effective 
antioxidant and its protective mechanisms against chronic ammonia stress in 
crucian carp is highly valuable. Experimental fish (initial weight 
20.47 ± 1.68 g) were fed diets supplemented with or without 0.1% α-lipoic acid 
followed by a chronic ammonia exposure (10 mg/L) for 42 days. The results 
revealed that chronic ammonia stress affected growth (weight gain rate, specific 
growth rate, and feed conversion rate), leading to oxidative stress (decreased 
the activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, 
glutathione peroxidase; decreased total antioxidant capacity), increased lipid 
peroxidation (accumulation of malondialdehyde), immune suppression (decreased 
contents of nonspecific immune enzymes AKP and ACP, 50% hemolytic complement, 
and decrease of immunoglobulin M), impaired ammonia metabolism (reduced contents 
of Glu, GS, GSH, and Gln), imbalance of expression of induced 
antioxidant-related genes (downregulation of Cu/Zu SOD, CAT, Nrf2, and HO-1; 
upregulation of GST and Keap1), induction of pro-apoptotic molecules 
(transcription of BAX, Caspase3, and Caspase9), downregulation of anti-apoptotic 
gene Bcl-2 expression, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress 
(upregulation of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 expression). The results suggested that 
the supplementation of α-lipoic acid could effectively induce humoral immunity, 
alleviate oxidative stress injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and 
ultimately alleviate liver injury induced by ammonia poisoning (50-60% 
reduction). This provides theoretical basis for revealing the toxicity of 
long-term ammonia stress and provides new insights into the anti-ammonia 
toxicity mechanism of α-lipoic acid.

INTRODUCTION: As the population ages, surgeons are growing frequently faced with 
hard choices among a vast array of treatment options for the elderly. This study 
was to investigate safety and efficacy of resection in elderly patients with 
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Literature reading and meta-analysis unveiled that elderly 
PHCC patients held a higher risk of death within 90 days after hepatectomy 
relative to younger patients, but their 5-year overall survival and disease-free 
survival were comparable. Among PHCC patients who underwent hepatectomy, the 
proportion of elderly patients with tumor classification Bismuth I-II and tumor 
stage pStage 1-3 was significantly higher than that of younger patients.
RESULTS: Curative resection R0 was more common in elderly patients than younger 
patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because of more 
comorbidities and less physiological reserve of elderly patients, they seemed to 
suffer more postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: Considering improved life expectancy, it is crucial to treat elderly 
PHCC patients appropriately and attempts should be made to radical surgery based 
on comorbidities and functional status.

Tick species are vectors of harmful human and animal diseases, and their 
expansion is raising concerns under the global environmental changes' scenario. 
Ticks host and transmit bacteria, protozoa and viruses, making the understanding 
of host-pathogen molecular pathways critical to development of effective disease 
control strategies. Despite the considerable sizes and repeat contents of tick 
genomes, individual tick genomics is perhaps the most effective approach to 
reveal genotypic traits of interest. Presence-Absence gene Variations (PAVs) can 
contribute to individual differences within species, with dispensable genes 
carried by subsets of individuals possibly underpinning functional significance 
at individual or population-levels. We exploited 350 resequencing datasets of 
Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes persulcatus, 
Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus hard tick specimens to 
reveal the extension of PAV and the conservation of dispensable genes among 
individuals and, comparatively, between species. Overall, we traced 550-3,346 
dispensable genes per species and were able to reconstruct 5.3-7 Mb of genomic 
regions not included in the respective reference genomes, as part of the tick 
pangenomes. Both dispensable genes and de novo predicted genes indicated that 
PAVs preferentially impacted mobile genetic elements in these tick species.

INTRODUCTION: With the increasing life expectancy of people with haemophilia, 
the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and thrombotic events has become a 
growing concern. Longitudinal studies on the incidence and risk factors of CVD 
in this population are limited, and optimal prevention and treatment strategies 
are yet to be established.
AIM: This study aimed to present the baseline data of a prospective longitudinal 
study focusing on a subset of Japanese patients with haemophilia, specifically 
investigated the incidence, risk factors and treatment modalities for CVD and 
thrombotic diseases in people aged 40 years in Japan over 10 years through the 
ADVANCE Japan study.
METHODS: The ADVANCE Japan study is a prospective multicentre cohort study 
involving 600 adult individuals with haemophilia A/B aged 40 years in Japan. The 
primary endpoint was the incidence of CVD, with secondary endpoints encompassing 
anticoagulant use, mortality rates, and comparison with the general population.
RESULTS: Baseline data from the 600 participants revealed that thrombotic events 
occurred in 13 individuals (2.2%), mostly in those with haemophilia A. Atrial 
fibrillation was observed in 11 participants (1.8%). Hypertension and 
dyslipidaemia were identified as the prevalent risk factors. Various 
prophylactic treatments were employed, and no severe bleeding events were 
observed during the study period.
CONCLUSION: This study provides vital baseline data for a 10-year prospective 
investigation of CVD and thrombotic disease risk in people with haemophilia. 
These findings will contribute to refining prevention and treatment approaches 
and improving patients' quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of 
telerehabilitation in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have 
increased. However, the study quality and results differ, systematic reviews are 
limited. We aimed to synthesise systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess 
the effects of telerehabilitation in patients post-TKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding the 
effectiveness and safety of TKA telerehabilitation were retrieved from eight 
databases from establishment to 18 December 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), A Measurement Tool to Assess 
Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) and 
GRADE system were used to evaluate results, methods, bias and evidence quality.
RESULTS: Thirteen systematic reviews and meta-analyses were analysed. The AMSTAR 
2 showed low methodological quality in seven studies and very low quality in 
six. Among the key items, item 2 had been registered on website before 
systematic review in four reviews. Concerning item 4, did not provide a 
comprehensive search strategy in 4 reviews. For item 7, none of the reviews 
provided a list of reasons for excluding an article. For item 9, regarding 
whether appropriate tools were used to assess the risk of bias of each included 
study, one review was assessed as 'partially yes', one review only included 
RCTs, and the remainder were assessed as 'yes'. For item 11, one review did not 
specify the statistical methods used, and three reviews did not conduct a 
meta-analysis. For item 13, four reviews considered the risk of bias when 
interpreting or discussing the study results. For item 15, seven reviews did not 
evaluate publication bias. The PRISMA scores of the 13 reviews ranged from 17.5 
to 26.0. The PRISMA indicated that 69.2% had no protocol registration, 38.5% did 
not provide other materials and evidence certainty, 23.1% did not provide 
certainty assessment, 30.8% did not report study bias. According to the ROBIS 
scale, diferrent domains have diferrent risks in all the reviews.
CONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation positively affects walking ability, knee 
extension and patient costs post-TKA surgery. Regarding the quality of life, 
patient satisfaction and the WOMAC, telerehabilitation had similar effects to 
conventional rehabilitation. Owing to the low quality of the studies, these 
conclusions should be interpreted cautiously, high-quality studies are needed in 
the future.

Injuries are responsible for a high premature mortality and disability. They are 
poorly explored in low and middle income-countries. We aimed to estimate the 
burden of hospitalized injuries in the Monastir governorate (Tunisia) according 
to the nature of the injury, trends and projections of hospitalizations for 
injuries up until 2024, and to identify the distribution of this disease burden 
based on age and sex. We performed a descriptive study from 2002 to 2012 
including all hospitalizations for injuries. Data were collected from morbidity 
and mortality register of the University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia). We 
estimated the burden of injuries using the Disability Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs). We described injuries (crude prevalence rate (CPR) and age standardized 
prevalence rate (ASR)), related mortality (lethality and standardized mortality 
ratio (SMR)), trends and prediction for 2024. A total of 18,632 hospitalizations 
for injuries representing 10% of all hospitalizations during study period were 
recorded. Per 1000 inhabitants per year, CPR was 3.36 and the ASR was 3.44. The 
lethality was of 17.5 deaths per 1000 injured inpatients per year and the SMR 
was of 2.95 (Confidence Interval of 95%: 2.64-3.29). Burden related to injuries 
was 2.36 DALYs per 1000 population per year, caused mainly by Years of Life Lost 
(83.4%), most frequent among men aged under 40 years. The predicted ASR for 2024 
was 4.46 (3.81-5.23) per 1000 person-years. Injuries to the head was the most 
prevalent (20.7%) causing 67.7% of DALYs; and increasing by 226% through 2024. 
Injuries had a high prevalence and an important burden in a Tunisian university 
hospital. Prediction showed increased prevalence for 2024. Preventive measures 
and a trauma surveillance register should be implemented soon.

OBJECTIVE: With expanding eligibility criteria, transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement is being performed on patients with longer life expectancy, and 
subsequent procedures after index transcatheter aortic valve replacement are 
inevitable. This study examines the incidence and outcomes of patients 
undergoing subsequent procedural readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement.
METHODS: All patients who underwent index transcatheter aortic valve replacement 
and were discharged alive from January 2012 to December 2019 at a single 
institution were evaluated. Study end points were mortality and readmission for 
procedure with more than 1-day hospital stay. Effect on survival was evaluated 
by treating procedural readmission as a time-dependent variable by Cox 
proportional hazard model and competing risk analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1092 patients met inclusion criteria with a median follow-up 
time of 34 months. A total of 218 patients (20.0%) had 244 subsequent procedural 
readmissions. During the 244 procedural readmissions, there were 260 procedures; 
96 (36.9%) were cardiac (most commonly pacemaker implantation, percutaneous 
coronary interventions, and surgical aortic valve replacements), and 164 (63.1%) 
were noncardiac (most commonly orthopedic and gastrointestinal procedures). The 
overall procedural readmission rates were 32%, 39%, and 42%, and all-cause 
mortality was 27%, 44%, and 54% at 20, 40, and 60 months, respectively. 
Procedural readmissions were not associated with a survival penalty in any 
surgical risk group or on Cox regression (hazard ratio, 1.25; 0.91-1.64, 
P = .17).
CONCLUSIONS: After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, procedural 
interventions are seen frequently, with most procedures occurring within the 
first year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, subsequent 
procedural readmissions do not appear to have a survival penalty for patients 
after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. After transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement with resolution of aortic stenosis, subsequent procedures can and 
should be pursued if they are needed.

Global brachial plexus injury (GBPI) mainly affects adults and causes severe 
life-changing consequences that lead to the deterioration of patients' quality 
of life. Several surgical approaches have been described and reported in the 
literature to improve patients' functional ability. A literature review is done 
on PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase using specific keywords to retrieve relevant 
articles assessing different surgical approaches for GBPI management. Inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were applied, and eligible articles were included in the 
review. The literature survey revealed that various surgical options had been 
used to manage GBPI patients. In this concise review, we discuss and compare the 
different surgical approaches related to GBPI and its outcome in terms of 
restoring elbow flexion and extension, shoulder abduction, and wrist and hand 
function. The primary surgical intervention relies mainly on transferring single 
or multiple nerves with/without nerve grafts to restore the function of the 
targeted muscle. Different techniques using a variety of nerve donors and 
recipients are compared to assess the functional outcomes of each option. 
Moreover, further options are addressed for delayed GBPI injuries or failed 
nerve transfer procedures, as in free functional muscle transfer techniques. In 
addition, information about brachial plexus injury cases faced in our center is 
presented along with our center's approach to diagnosing and managing partial 
and GBPI cases.

Household income does not affect the pleiotropy of schizophrenia genetic 
liability with mental and physical health outcomes.

Kouakou MR, Cabrera-Mendoza B, Pathak GA, Cannon TD, Polimanti R.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) suffer from 
comorbidities that substantially reduce their life expectancy. Socioeconomic 
inequalities could contribute to many of the negative health outcomes associated 
with SCZ.
STUDY DESIGN: We investigated genome-wide datasets related to SCZ (52,017 cases 
and 75,889 controls) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, household income 
(HI; N=361,687) from UK Biobank, and 2,202 medical endpoints assessed in up to 
342,499 FinnGen participants. A phenome-wide genetic correlation analysis of SCZ 
and HI was performed, also assessing whether SCZ genetic correlations were 
influenced by HI effect on SCZ. Additionally, SCZ and HI direct effects on 
medical endpoints were estimated using multivariable Mendelian randomization 
(MR).
STUDY RESULTS: SCZ and HI showed overlapping genetic correlations with 70 traits 
(p<2.89×10 -5 ), including mental health, substance use, gastrointestinal 
illnesses, reproductive outcomes, liver diseases, respiratory problems, and 
musculoskeletal phenotypes. SCZ genetic correlations with these traits were not 
affected by HI effect on SCZ. Considering Bonferroni multiple testing correction 
(p<7.14×10 -4 ), MR analysis indicated that SCZ and HI may affect medical 
abortion (SCZ odds ratio, OR=1.07; HI OR=0.78), panic disorder (SCZ OR=1.20; HI 
OR=0.60), personality disorders (SCZ OR=1.31; HI OR=0.67), substance use (SCZ 
OR=1.2; HI OR=0.68), and adjustment disorders (SCZ OR=1.18; HI OR=0.78). 
Multivariable MR analysis confirmed that SCZ effects on these outcomes were 
independent of HI.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of SCZ genetic liability on mental and physical health 
may not be strongly affected by socioeconomic differences. This suggests that 
SCZ-specific strategies are needed to reduce negative health outcomes affecting 
patients and high-risk individuals.

BACKGROUND: Statin therapy in multimorbid older individuals with polypharmacy is 
controversial, particularly in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
Thereby, physicians must weigh potential benefits against potential side 
effects, drug-drug interactions, and limited life expectancy.
AIM: To assess the prevalence and determinants of potentially inappropriate 
statin therapy in multimorbid older patients.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of patients aged ≥70 years with 
multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the Swiss study center of OPERAM, a 
cluster-randomized trial on pharmacotherapy optimization to reduce drug-related 
hospital admissions. We assessed potential underuse (no statin but formal 
indication) and potential overuse (statin but no formal indication, including 
predicted >60% one-year mortality based on the Walter Score) based on current 
guidelines for patients in secondary and primary cardiovascular prevention. We 
assessed the association of potential statin overuse and underuse with six 
patient characteristics (age, gender, number of diagnoses, number of 
medications, mental impairment, being housebound) in LASSO-selection analyses.
RESULTS: Of 715 multimorbid older adults (79.7 ± 6.5 years, 39.9% women), 337 
(47%) were on statin. Statin therapy was appropriate in 474 (66.3%), underused 
in 130 (18.2%), and overused in 111 (15.5%) patients. In participants in 
secondary cardiovascular prevention (n = 437), being female (odds ratio [OR] 
2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-4.22) was significantly associated with 
potential underuse while being housebound (OR 3.53, 95%CI 1.32-9.46) and taking 
≥10 medications (OR 1.95,95%CI 1.05-3.67) were associated with potential 
overuse. In participants in primary cardiovascular prevention (n = 278), 28.1% 
were potentially under- (9%) or overusing (19%) a statin, with no identified 
risk factor.
CONCLUSION: A third of hospitalized multimorbid older patients with polypharmacy 
potentially (either) overused or underused statin therapy. Among patients in 
secondary cardiovascular prevention, women were at risk for potential statin 
underuse. Housebound patients and those taking ≥10 medications were at risk for 
potential overuse of a statin. Physicians should carefully evaluate the 
indication for statin prescription in multimorbid older patients with 
polypharmacy.
