rate of medical progress. A welfare analysis shows that while the subsidization 
of health care through health insurance creates excessive health care spending, 
the gains in life expectancy brought about by induced medical progress more than 
compensate for this.

AIMS: Patients suffering from chronic ischaemic heart failure with reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) have reduced quality-of-life, repetitive 
hospital admissions, and reduced life expectancy. Allogeneic cell therapy is 
currently investigated as a potential treatment option after initially 
encouraging results from clinical autologous and allogeneic trials in patients 
with HFrEF. We aimed to investigate the allogeneic Cardiology Stem Cell Centre 
Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal Stromal Cell product (CSCC_ASC) as an add-on 
therapy in patients with chronic HFrEF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a Danish multi-centre double-blinded 
placebo-controlled phase II study with direct intra-myocardial injections of 
allogeneic CSCC_ASC. A total of 81 HFrEF patients were included and randomized 
2:1 to CSCC_ASC or placebo injections. The inclusion criteria were reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 45%), New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class II-III despite optimal anti-congestive heart failure medication and no 
further revascularization options. Injections of 0.3 mL CSCC_ASC (total cell 
dose 100 × 106 ASCs) (n = 54) or isotonic saline (n = 27) were performed into 
the viable myocardium in the border zone of infarcted tissue using the NOGA 
Myostar® catheter (Biological Delivery System, Cordis, Johnson & Johnson, USA). 
The primary endpoint, left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), was 
evaluated at 6-month follow-up. The safety was measured during a 3-years 
follow-up period.
RESULTS: Mean age was 67.0 ± 9.0 years and 66.6 ± 8.1 years in the ASC and 
placebo groups, respectively. LVESV was unchanged from baseline to 6-month 
follow-up in the ASC (125.7 ± 68.8 mL and 126.3 ± 72.5 mL, P = 0.827) and 
placebo (134.6 ± 45.8 mL and 135.3 ± 49.6 mL, P = 0.855) group without any 
differences between the groups (0.0 mL (95% CI -9.1 to 9.0 mL, P = 0.992). 
Neither were there significant changes in left ventricular end diastolic volume 
or LVEF within the two groups or between groups -5.7 mL (95% CI -16.7 to 5.3 mL, 
P = 0.306) and -1.7% (95% CI -4.4. to 1.0, P = 0.212), respectively). NYHA 
classification and 6-min walk test did not alter significantly in the two groups 
(P > 0.05). The quality-of-life, total symptom, and overall summary score 
improved significantly only in the ASC group but not between groups. There were 
24 serious adverse events (SAEs) in the ASC group and 11 SAEs in the placebo 
group without any significant differences between the two groups at 1-year 
follow-up. Kaplan-Meier plot using log-rank test of combined cardiac events 
showed an overall mean time to event of 30 ± 2 months in the ASC group and 
29 ± 2 months in the placebo group without any differences between the groups 
during the 3 years follow-up period (P = 0.994).
CONCLUSIONS: Intramyocardial CSCC_ASC injections in patients with chronic HFrEF 
were safe but did not improve myocardial function or structure, nor clinical 
symptoms.

In recent decades, obesity has extensively emerged to the level of pandemics. 
It's significantly associated with serious co-morbidities that could decrease 
life quality and even life expectancy. Obesity has several determinants, such as 
age, sex, endocrine, and genetic factors. The miRNAs have emerged as genetic 
factors affecting obesity. The miRNAs are small noncoding nucleic acids that can 
modify gene expression and hence, control biological processes. The miRNAs can 
greatly affect many biological processes in obesity, such as adipogenesis, lipid 
metabolism, and homeostasis. As a result, the entry of miRNAs in obesity 
therapeutic approaches has been strongly advised as miRNAs mimics, inhibitors, 
and stimulators. Hence, this review aims to point out a summarized and updated 
overview of miRNAs and their roles in obesity and its included processes, such 
as adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Besides, we also review recent 
applications of miRNAs as a treatment approach for obesity.

In type 1 diabetes, average life expectancy is reduced by ˃10 years as compared 
with outside of diabetes. Residual cardiovascular risk defines high 
cardiovascular event rate despite modern, guideline-recommended standard of care 
of established risk factors like hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and glycaemic 
control, and it adds importantly to these lost years of life in type 1 diabetes 
due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and 
ischaemic stroke. With a growing understanding of inflammation as an important 
driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, residual inflammatory risk is 
a novel and common risk factor and a promising target for lowering residual 
cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, the inexpensive 
anti-inflammatory agent colchicine reduced the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events by 25% in cardiovascular outcome trials in the secondary 
prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Here, we summarize the 
role of inflammation as a driver of atherosclerosis and review current evidence 
linking inflammation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in type 1 
diabetes. Also, we provide an overview of the evidence base for targeting 
residual inflammatory risk with colchicine for lowering residual cardiovascular 
risk in type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic condition characterized by 
global developmental delay, including severe intellectual disability. The 
parents of persons with AS experience increased stress, anxiety, and depression. 
This impacts parents' career choices and productivity.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate, for the first time, the total productivity lost by the 
parents of persons with AS over a 10-year period in Australia and the 
corresponding cost to society.
METHODS: A cost-of-illness model with simulated follow-up over a 10-year period 
was developed, with 2019 as the baseline year, facilitated by a Markov chain of 
life tables. The prevalence of persons with AS and their parents, the 
productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost by parents, and the cost to 
society were estimated. Key data were obtained from a prospective cohort of AS 
families, peer-reviewed literature, and publicly available sources.
RESULTS: The base-case productivity burden borne by the estimated 330 living 
parents of the 428 prevalent persons with AS totaled AUD$45.30 million, 
corresponding to a loss of 38.42% of PALYs per parent.
CONCLUSIONS: Caring for a child with AS has a significant impact on the 
productivity of affected parents, with a large associated impact on the broader 
Australian economy.

AIM: To enhance health services that can address multifaceted issues, the 
Questionnaire for Medical Checkup of Old-Old (QMCOO) was strategically developed 
to ascertain frailty status. Using the National Health Insurance database 
system, we aimed to clarify whether the QMCOO can predict new certifications for 
long-term care for disabilities.
METHOD: Of 20 151 adults aged ≥75 years who underwent health checkups in Kashiwa 
City, Japan, in fiscal year 2020 (examination rate 36.8%), 18 130 persons were 
included (mean age 80.1 ± 4.1 years, 55.1% women). The outcome was the new 
certification of long-term care until January 2022. From the medical care 
receipt data, QMCOO, age, sex, living arrangement, body mass index, comorbidity, 
and musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases were evaluated.
RESULT: During the follow-up period, 727 (4.0%) participants had an incident 
disability (median follow up 457 days [quartile range 408-519 days]). The 
QMCOO's predictive accuracy for new long-term care needs was optimal when the 
total score of 3/4 was used as the threshold. Older adults with scores ≥4 had a 
higher adjusted hazard ratio for incident disability (adjusted hazard ratio 2.5, 
95% confidence interval 2.1-2.9). Furthermore, the adjusted hazard ratio was 
greatly enhanced with comorbidity (6.6, 95% confidence interval 4.8-8.9).
CONCLUSION: The QMCOO, which reflects multifaceted frailty, might be predictive 
of incident disability, and its predictive accuracy could be improved by 
considering comorbidities. The comprehensive QMCOO could contribute to extending 
healthy life expectancy through efficiently assessing health care and preventing 
long-term care, even among the old-old in the latter stage who tended to suffer 
from multimorbidity. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2023; 23: 124-130.

Cystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) are rare chronic conditions which 
management differs according to the type (macrocystic LMs, microcystic LMs or 
both). Studies are lacking due to rarity of the pathology. We aimed to establish 
a French National Diagnosis and Care Protocol (PNDS: Protocole National de 
Diagnostic et de Soins), to provide health professionals with free open access 
synthesis on optimal management and care of patients with LMs ( 
https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-03/malformations_lymphatiques_kystiques_-_pnds.pdf 
). The process included a critical review of the literature and 
multidisciplinary expert consensus. LMs are congenital but are not always 
discovered at birth. Nearly 75% of them are located in the head and neck because 
of the highly dense lymphatic system in this region. Physical examination 
(showing painless masses with normal skin color and depressible consistency, or 
cutaneous/mucosal lymphangiectasia) and color Doppler ultrasonography, usually 
allow for diagnosis. MRI (involving T2 sequences with fat saturation in at least 
two spatial planes) is the tool of choice for evaluating anatomical extension, 
characterizing lesions (microcystic and macrocystic), and before considering 
therapeutic management. A biopsy, coupled to a blood sample, can also be used 
for molecular biology analyses, to search for activating mutations of the PIK3CA 
gene, particularly with LM integrating in a syndromic form (CLOVES or 
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome) but also in certain isolated (or common) LMs. The 
spontaneous evolution of LMs, in particular microcystic forms, is often toward 
progressive aggravation, with an increase in the number of vesicles, thickening, 
increased oozing and bleeding, while pure macrocystic LMs may regress due to 
"natural sclerosis", i.e. fibrosis secondary to an inflammatory reorganization 
after common infantile infections. In case of voluminous LMs or syndromic forms, 
functional and psychological repercussions can be major, deteriorating the 
patient's quality of life. LMs must be treated by physicians integrated in 
multidisciplinary teams, and be personalized. Management is a life-long process 
that involves one or several of these therapies: conservative management, 
physical therapy (compression), sclerotherapy, surgery, drugs such as mTOR 
inhibitors (sirolimus), that has shown efficacy in decreasing the volume of LMs, 
and, more recently, PI3K-inhibitors in syndromic forms. Psychological and social 
support is necessary, taking into account the patient and his family.

BACKGROUND: The combinations of BRAF + MEK inhibitors-encorafenib (ENC) + 
binimetinib (BIN), cobimetinib (COB) + vemurafenib (VEM), and dabrafenib (DAB) + 
trametinib (TRA)-are recommended for the treatment of BRAF-mutated advanced 
melanoma.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ENC + BIN versus 
COB + VEM versus DAB + TRA from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate a hypothetical cohort over a 
time horizon of 10 years. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS) curves were independently digitized from a randomized controlled 
trial for ENC + BIN and fitted using R software. Published and indirectly 
estimated hazard ratios were used to fit OS and PFS curves for COB + VEM and DAB 
+ TRA. Costs, life-year gains, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
associated with the 3 treatment combinations were estimated. A base case 
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to estimate 
the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). A discount rate of 3.5% was applied 
on cost and outcomes.
RESULTS: The ENC + BIN versus COB + VEM comparison was associated with an ICUR 
of $656 233 per QALY gained. The ENC + BIN versus DAB + TRA comparison was 
associated with an ICUR of $3 135 269 per QALY gained. The DAB + TRA combination 
dominated COB + VEM. The base case analysis estimates were confirmed by the PSA 
estimates. ENC + BIN was the most cost-effective combination at a high 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $573 000 per QALY and $1.5 million/QALY 
when compared to COB + VEM and DAB + TRA, respectively.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Given current prices and acceptable WTP thresholds, 
our study suggests that DAB + TRA is the optimum treatment. In this study, ENC + 
BIN was cost-effective only at a very high WTP per QALY threshold.

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an underdiagnosed condition with a high 
disease burden. Due to delayed diagnosis and limited access to specialist care, 
conventional health data might not sufficiently capture the perspective of 
affected individuals. The aim of this study was to assess public interest, unmet 
needs, and disease burden of axSpA in Germany through the analysis of thematic, 
geographic, and temporal patterns in national web search data. Google Ads 
Keyword Planner was used to identify axSpA-related keywords and their monthly 
search volume in Germany between January 2017 and December 2020. Identified 
keywords were qualitatively categorized into six categories. Overall, 265 
axSpA-related keywords with a search volume of 3,881,490 queries were 
identified. Nearly 81% of the total search volume was assigned to the category 
terms and definition, while 19% referred to either outcomes, symptoms, 
diagnosis, management, or causes. In the category outcomes, prognostic outcomes 
like "life expectancy" generated more searches than physical manifestations like 
"pain". Less populated cities showed significantly more searches per 100,000 
inhabitants than larger cities. Searches were seasonally stable with a 
Germany-wide peak in July 2017. This study provides an overview of public 
interest in axSpA based on web search data in Germany. The identified search 
patterns could be used to guide public health campaigns and optimize axSpA 
management in Germany.

Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of dementia. Accurate diagnosis and 
prognosis of this disease are essential to design an appropriate treatment plan, 
increasing the life expectancy of the patient. Intense research has been 
conducted on the use of machine learning to identify Alzheimer's Disease from 
neuroimaging data, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging. In recent 
years, advances of deep learning in computer vision suggest a new research 
direction for this problem. Current deep learning-based approaches in this 
field, however, have a number of drawbacks, including the interpretability of 
model decisions, a lack of generalizability information and a lower performance 
compared to traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we design a 
two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the first stage, an 
ensemble of 125 U-Nets is used to grade the input image, producing a 3D map that 
reflects the disease severity at voxel-level. This map can help to localize 
abnormal brain areas caused by the disease. In the second stage, we model a 
graph per individual using the generated grading map and other information about 
the subject. We propose to use a graph convolutional neural network classifier 
for the final classification. As a result, our framework demonstrates 
comparative performance to the state-of-the-art methods in different datasets 
for both diagnosis and prognosis. We also demonstrate that the use of a large 
ensemble of U-Nets offers a better generalization capacity for our framework.

Other Dementias in Mexico. Results at the National and Subnational Levels, 
1990-2019.

INTRODUCTION: Dementias, including Alzheimer´s disease (AD), are one of the 
leading causes of disability and mortality in older people. It is a growing 
health problem in low- and middle-income countries, where epidemiological 
information is scarce and deficient. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
burden of AD and other dementias in Mexico from 1990 to 2019 by sex, subnational 
level, and age groups.
METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the 2019 Global 
Burden of Disease, Injury, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Data on prevalence, 
incidence, mortality, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability 
(YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to AD and other dementias 
were obtained. A joinpoint regression analysis was performed to describe the 
changes in the trend of age-standardized DALY rates by AD and other dementias 
during the analysis period.
RESULTS: AD and other dementias ranked second among neurological disorders 
producing the most DALY in Mexico. Between 1990 and 2019, prevalence and 
incidence increased by almost 203%. In 2019, the age-standardized rate per 
100,000 inhabitants was: 512 for prevalence, 79.3 for incidence, 73.3 for YLD, 
256.9 for YLL and 272.2 for DALY. Likewise, five states concentrated 39% of AD 
and other dementias cases: Ciudad de México, Estado de México, Veracruz, Jalisco 
and Puebla. Differences were also observed by sex and age groups.
DISCUSSION: Given that the number of older adults in Mexico will significantly 
rise over the next few decades, AD and other dementias represent one of the most 
important health challenges. The fact that epidemiological and demographic 
transformations take place in Mexico in a very diverse way makes it difficult 
for the country to adequately plan for the growing demands of both people with 
AD and other dementias and their families.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia. It 
manifests as early-onset or late-onset AD. Early-onset AD represents about 5.5% 
of the total cases and occurs in patients under age 65. The EOAD progresses more 
aggressively and has a shorter life expectancy due to a greater pathogenic load. 
We present two asymptomatic siblings, a 30-year-old male and a 34- year-old 
female, who are heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic variant c.428T>C 
(Ile143Thr) in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene. During genetic counseling, 
assisted reproduction techniques (ART) coupled with embryo biopsy and a 
preimplantation genetic test for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) were recommended to 
provide reproductive care for the patients and their partners. ART and 
preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) have made it possible to have 
chromosomally normal and genetically unaffected offspring, allowing patients 
with genetic diseases to become parents.

Cognitive impairment and organic solvent exposure have been becoming public 
health concerns due to an increasingly aging population, increased life 
expectancy, urbanization, and industrialization. Converging evidence indicates 
the link between 1,2-diacetylbenzene (DAB), prolactin (PRL), risperidone, and 
cognitive impairment. However, these relationships remain unclear. We 
investigated the therapeutic properties of risperidone in DAB-induced cognitive 
impairment using both in vivo and in silico methods. Risperidone alleviated 
DAB-induced cognitive impairment in hippocampal mice, possibly by inhibiting 
GSK-3β, β-amyloid, CDK5, BACE, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Risperidone also 
attenuated the activation of TREM-1/DAP12/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β, and TLR4/NF-κB 
pathways caused by DAB. Furthermore, risperidone inhibited DAB-induced oxidative 
stress, advanced glycation end products, and proinflammatory cytokines, as well 
as increased the expression of Nrf2, IL-10, Stat3, MDM2, and catalase activity. 
On the other hand, risperidone activated the expression of IRS1, PI3K, AKT, 
BDNF, Drd2, Scna5, and Trt as well as reduced the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and Caspase-3 
levels. In silico analyses identified the prolactin signaling pathway, 
miR-155-5p, miR-34a-5p, and CEBPB as the main molecular mechanisms involved in 
the pathophysiology of DAB-induced cognitive impairment and targeted by 
risperidone. Our results suggest that risperidone could be used to treat 
cognitive impairment caused by organic solvents, especially DAB.

Aging is one of the world's greatest concerns, requiring urgent, effective, 
large-scale interventions to decrease the number of late-life chronic diseases 
and improve human healthspan. Anti-aging drug therapy is one of the most 
promising strategies to combat the effects of aging. However, most 
geroprotective compounds are known to successfully affect only a few 
aging-related targets. Given this, there is a great biological rationale for the 
use of combinations of anti-aging interventions. In this review, we characterize 
the various types of compound combinations used to modulate lifespan, discuss 
the existing evidence on their role in life extension, and present some key 
points about current challenges and future prospects for the development of 
combination drug anti-aging therapy.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a common disabling progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder. We aimed to report the prevalence, death and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to PD in the Middle East and 
North Africa (MENA) region and its 21 countries by age, sex and 
socio-demographic index (SDI), between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Publicly available data on the burden of PD in the MENA countries were 
retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 project. The results are 
presented with age-standardised numbers and rates per 100,000 population, along 
with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: In 2019, PD had an age-standardised point prevalence of 82.6 per 
100,000 population in MENA and an age-standardised death rate of 5.3, which have 
increased from 1990 to 2019 by 15.4% and 2.3%, respectively. In 2019, the 
age-standardised DALY rate of PD was 84.4, which was 0.9% higher than in 1990. 
The highest and lowest age-standardised DALY rates of PD in 2019 were found in 
Qatar and Kuwait, respectively. Also in 2019, the highest number of prevalent 
cases and number of DALYs were found in the 75-79 age group for both sexes. In 
2019, females in MENA had an overall higher DALY rate. Furthermore, from 1990 to 
2019 the burden of PD generally decreased with increasing socio-economic 
development, up to an SDI of around 0.4, and then increased with higher levels 
of SDI.
CONCLUSION: An upward trend was observed in the point prevalence of PD over the 
last three decades. This highlights the need to allocate more resources for 
research. Furthermore, properly equipped healthcare services are needed for the 
increasing number of patients with PD.

Frailty and surgical outcomes in gastrointestinal cancer: Integration of 
geriatric assessment and prehabilitation into surgical practice for vulnerable 
patients.

Sciences Kumamoto University Kumamoto Japan.

As life expectancy increases, the older population continues to grow rapidly, 
resulting in increased requirement for surgery for older patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer. Older individuals represent a heterogeneous group in 
terms of physiological reserves, co-morbidity, cognitive impairment, and 
disability. Owing to the lack of treatment guidelines for vulnerable patients 
with gastrointestinal cancer, these patients are more likely to be at risk of 
undertreatment or overtreatment. Hence, the identification of frail patients 
with gastrointestinal cancer would improve cancer treatment outcomes. Although 
there is no standardized geriatric assessment tool, a growing body of research 
has shown associations of frailty with adverse postoperative outcomes and poor 
prognosis after resection of gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary-pancreatic 
cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that prehabilitation, which includes 
exercise and nutritional support, can improve preoperative functional capacity, 
postoperative recovery, and surgical outcomes, particularly in frail patients 
with gastrointestinal cancer. We reviewed major geriatric assessment tools for 
identification of frail patients and summarized clinical studies on frailty and 
surgical outcomes, as well as prehabilitation or rehabilitation in 
gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancers. The integration of 
preoperative geriatric assessment and prehabilitation of frail patients in 
clinical practice may improve surgical outcomes. In addition, improving 
preoperative vulnerability and preventing functional decline after surgery is 
important in providing favorable long-term survival in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer. Further clinical trials are needed to examine the 
effects of minimally invasive surgery, and chemotherapy in frail patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of indolent 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The median age of diagnosis for FL is 65 years old. 
Although the median life expectancy after diagnosis is approximately 10 years, 
the incurable disease has a high risk of transformation. This case report 
focuses on an 80-year-old patient diagnosed with low-grade follicular lymphoma 
which subsequently transformed leading to the patient's eventual demise as the 
patient took on the palliative intent. This case report aims to highlight the 
importance of clinical markers or prognostic factors to identify patients, 
specifically the elderly population who are at risk of transformation to 
aggressive forms when their FL remains at stage I-II phases. Currently, elderly 
patients with FL tend to be quickly dismissed with curative intent with 
chemotherapy, given their age and comorbidities, despite forming the majority of 
the population with follicular lymphoma. Age more than 60 years old has been 
shown to be one of the most powerful yet poor prognostic features in follicular 
lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI)-the main scoring system used for 
FL. Hence, further studies are required to look into the tailoring treatment for 
elderly patients with follicular lymphoma after risk stratifying them with 
appropriate clinical and prognostic markers.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As life expectancy increases, the ageing population accrues 
an increasing burden of chronic conditions and functional compromise. Some 
conditions that lead to compromise are deemed part of 'natural ageing,' whereas 
others are considered to represent disease processes. Ageing ('a natural 
process') and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ('a disease') share many 
common features, both pulmonary and systemic. At times, the pathways of injury 
are the same, and at times they are concurrent. In some cases, age and disease 
are separated not by the presence but by the severity of a finding or condition. 
This brief review aims to compare some of the similarities between ageing and 
COPD and to compare/contrast mechanisms for each.
RECENT FINDINGS: At the cellular level, the natural process of ageing includes 
multiple systemic and molecular mechanisms. COPD, though defined by progressive 
pulmonary compromise, can also be a systemic disease/process. It has become 
evident that specific senescence pathways like p-16 and the sirtuin family of 
proteins are implicated both in ageing and in COPD. Also common to both ageing 
and COPD are increased inflammatory markers, leucocyte response abnormalities, 
and DNA-level abnormalities.
SUMMARY: The prevalence of COPD increases with increasing age. COPD contributes 
to the accrued burden of chronic disease and is a significant contributor to 
morbidity and mortality in this population. This review attempts to summarize 
some of similarities between ageing and COPD and their underlying mechanisms.

The use of lorlatinib, an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor for the 
treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is associated 
with dyslipidemia in over 80% of patients. Clinical trial protocols for the 
management of lorlatinib-associated dyslipidemia differ from clinical practice 
guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular disease, 
in that they are based on total cholesterol and triglyceride levels rather than 
on the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels that form the basis of current cardiovascular guideline 
recommendations. In order to simplify and harmonize the management of 
cardiovascular risk in patients with lorlatinib, an advisory committee 
consisting of a medical oncologist, a cardiologist, and two pharmacists with 
expertise in cardiology and oncology aimed to develop a simplified algorithm, 
adapted from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society dyslipidemia recommendations. 
Recommendations for the evaluation and management of hypercholesterolemia and 
isolated hypertriglyceridemia in patients treated with lorlatinib are outlined. 
These recommendations are based on data collected in a large number of 
lipid-lowering therapy trials applicable to individuals with and without cancer. 
Considering the relatively long life expectancy and improving prognosis of 
patients with ALK translocations, this specific patient population should be 
treated as are patients without cancer and are likely to derive the same 
benefits from lipid-lowering therapy.

PURPOSE: Patients with relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) have a 
high disease burden with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which 
worsens with each additional relapse. We aimed to review the impact of triplet, 
doublet, monotherapies, and salvage autologous stem cell transplantation on the
