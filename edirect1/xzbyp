The disparity in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
populations, including within high-income countries, is driven by a heightened 
risk of cardio-metabolic diseases. The current study recruited independent 
panels of experts in Indigenous cardio-metabolic health from Australia, New 
Zealand and the United States, in order to establish local consensus opinion and 
initiate dialogue on appropriate prevention strategies. Therefore, a three-round 
Delphi process was used to consolidate and compare the opinions of 60 experts, 
20 from each country. Round one, the experts were asked twelve open-ended 
questions across six domains: (i) prevention; (ii) consultation; (iii) 
educational resources; (iv) societal issues; (v) workforce issues; (vi) culture 
and family. Round two, the experts completed a structured questionnaire based on 
results from the first round, in which they ranked items according to their 
importance. Final round, the experts were asked to re-rank the same items after 
receiving summary feedback about the rank ordering from the previous round. 
Several themes emerged common to all three countries: (i) socio-economic and 
education inequalities should be addressed; (ii) educational, behaviour change 
and prevention strategies should address physical environmental determinants and 
be responsive to the local context, including being culturally appropriate; and 
(iii) cultural appropriateness can be achieved through consultation with 
Indigenous communities, cultural competency training, use of Indigenous health 
workers, and use of appropriate role models. These findings highlight several 
key priorities that can be used to initiate dialogue on appropriate prevention 
strategies. Such strategies should be contextualized to the local Indigenous 
populations.

With increase in life expectancy, the number of persons suffering from common 
age-related brain diseases, including neurodegenerative (e.g., dementia) and 
cerebrovascular (e.g., stroke) disease is expected to rise substantially. As 
current neuro-imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging may not be 
able to detect subtle subclinical changes (resolution <100-500 μm) in dementia 
and stroke, there is an urgent need for other complementary techniques to probe 
the pathophysiology of these diseases. The retina - due to its anatomical, 
embryological and physiological similarities with the brain - offers a unique 
and accessible "window" to study correlates and consequences of subclinical 
pathology in the brain. Retinal components such as the microvasculature and 
retinal ganglion cell axons can now be visualized non-invasively using different 
retinal imaging techniques e.g., ocular fundus photography and optical coherence 
tomography. Advances in retinal imaging may provide new and potentially 
important insights into cerebrovascular neurodegenerative processes in addition 
to what is currently possible with neuro-imaging. In this review, we present an 
overview of the current literature on the application of retinal imaging in the 
study of dementia and stroke. We discuss clinical implications of these studies, 
novel state-of-the-art retinal imaging techniques and future directions aimed at 
evaluating whether retinal imaging can be an additional investigation tool in 
the study of dementia and stroke.

Two major hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), regulate 
insect growth and development according to their precisely coordinated titres, 
which are controlled by both biosynthesis and degradation pathways. Juvenile 
hormone esterase (JHE) is the primary JH-specific degradation enzyme that plays 
a key role in regulating JH titers, along with JH epoxide hydrolase (JHEH) and 
JH diol kinase (JHDK). In the current study, a loss-of-function analysis of JHE 
in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, was performed by targeted gene disruption using 
the transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeats/RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases) system. Depletion of B. mori JHE (BmJHE) 
resulted in the extension of larval stages, especially the penultimate and 
ultimate larval stages, without deleterious effects to silkworm physiology. The 
expression of JHEH and JHDK was upregulated in mutant animals, indicating the 
existence of complementary routes in the JH metabolism pathway in which 
inactivation of one enzyme will activate other enzymes. RNA-Seq analysis of 
mutant animals revealed that genes involved in protein processing in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and in amino acid metabolism were affected by BmJHE 
depletion. Depletion of JHE and subsequent delayed JH metabolism activated genes 
in the TOR pathway, which are ultimately responsible for extending larval 
growth. The transgenic Cas9 system used in the current study provides a 
promising approach for analysing the actions of JH, especially in nondrosophilid 
insects. Furthermore, prolonging larval stages produced larger larvae and 
cocoons, which is greatly beneficial to silk production.

BACKGROUND: The restricted mean survival time (RMST) estimates life expectancy 
up to a given time horizon and can thus express the impact of a disease. The aim 
of this study was to estimate the 15-year RMST of a hypothetical cohort of 
incident patients starting renal replacement therapy (RRT), according to their 
age, gender and diabetes status, and to compare it with the expected RMST of the 
general population.
METHODS: Using data from 67 258 adult patients in the French Renal Epidemiology 
and Information Network (REIN) registry, we estimated the RMST of a hypothetical 
patient cohort (and its subgroups) for the first 15 years after starting RRT 
(cRMST) and used the general population mortality tables to estimate the 
expected RMST (pRMST). Results were expressed in three different ways: the 
cRMST, which calculates the years of life gained under the hypothesis of 100% 
death without RRT treatment, the difference between the pRMST and the cRMST (the 
years lost), and a ratio expressing the percentage reduction of the expected 
RMST: (pRMST - cRMST)/pRMST.
RESULTS: Over their first 15 years of RRT, the RMST of end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) patients decreased with age, ranging from 14.3 years in patients without 
diabetes aged 18 years at ESRD to 1.8 years for those aged 90 years, and from 
12.7 to 1.6 years, respectively, for those with diabetes; expected RMST varied 
from 15.0 to 4.1 years between 18 and 90 years. The number of years lost in all 
subgroups followed a bell curve that was highest for patients aged 70 years. 
After the age of 55 years in patients with and 70 years in patients without 
diabetes, the reduction of the expected RMST was >50%.
CONCLUSION: While neither a clinician nor a survival curve can predict with 
absolute certainty how long a patient will live, providing estimates on years 
gained or lost, or percentage reduction of expected RMST, may improve the 
accuracy of the prognostic estimates that influence clinical decisions and 
information given to patients.

Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that reduces life expectancy; therefore, the 
search for new alternative and effective treatments is ongoing. The aim of the 
present investigation was to identify the chemical compounds in the 
hydroethanolic extract of leaves of Jacaranda decurrens subsp. symmetrifoliolata 
and to evaluate their toxicity and antiobesity effects. High-performance liquid 
chromatography was used to identify the chemical constituents, and acute 
toxicity was evaluated in rats treated with doses of 2 and 5 g·kg-1 body mass. 
The antiobesity effect was determined in rats with hypercaloric diet-induced 
obesity. Our results revealed the presence of compounds, such as jacaric, 
ursolic, and oleic acids, as well as luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol, in the 
extract. The acute toxicity tests revealed that rats treated with elevated doses 
of the extract showed no signs of toxicity. The extract induced reduction in 
total body mass and the white adipose tissue depots. The obese rats treated with 
the extract showed an increased fluid intake and feces excretion while their 
serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased compared to those in 
the controls, without any hematological changes. Taken together, the results 
showed that the constituents of J. decurrens extracts included phenolic 
compounds and exhibited antiobesity effects with no toxicity.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease primarily 
characterized by the hallmarks of motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia, 
rigidity, and postural instability. However, through clinical investigations in 
patients and experimental findings in animal models of Parkinson's disease for 
years, it is now well recognized that Parkinson's disease is more than just a 
motor-deficit disorder. The majority of Parkinson's disease patients suffer from 
nonmotor disabilities, for instance, cognitive impairment, autonomic 
dysfunction, sensory dysfunction, and sleep disorder. So far, anti-PD 
prescriptions and surgical treatments have been mainly focusing on motor 
dysfunctions, leaving cognitive impairment a marginal clinical field. Within the 
nonmotor symptoms, cognitive impairment is one of the most common and 
significant aspects of Parkinson's disease, and cognitive deficits such as 
dysexecutive syndrome and visuospatial disturbances could seriously affect the 
quality of life, reduce life expectancy, prolong the duration of 
hospitalization, and therefore increase burdens of caregiver and medical costs. 
In this review, we have done a retrospective study of the recent related 
researches on epidemiology, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, genetics, and 
potential treatment of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease, aiming to 
provide a summary of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and make it 
easy for clinicians to tackle this challenging issue in their future practice.

OBJECTIVE: There are several prediction scales and parameters for prognosis 
after a cardiac arrest. One of these scales is the brain arrest neurological 
outcome scale (BrANOS), which consists of duration of cardiac arrest, Glasgow 
Coma Scale score and Hounsfield unit measured on cranial computed tomography 
(CT) scan. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of 
BrANOS on predicting the mortality and disability after a cardiac arrest.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated cardiac arrest patients who were 
hospitalized in our intensive care unit (ICU) within a 3-year period. Inclusion 
criteria were age over 18 years old, survival of more than 24 hours after 
cardiac arrest and availability of cranial CT. We recorded the age, sex, 
diagnosis, duration of cardiac arrest and hospital stay, mortality, Glasgow 
Outcome Score (GOS) and BrANOS score. The primary endpoint of the study was to 
establish the relationship between mortality and BrANOS score in patients who 
survived for more than 24 hours after a cardiac arrest. The secondary endpoint 
of the study was to determine the 2-year life expectancy and GOS after cardiac 
arrest.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57±17 years (33 females, 67 males). 
ICU mortality rate was 57%. The BrANOS mean score was 10.3±3.2. There was a 
significant difference between survivors and non-survivors in terms of the 
BrANOS score (8.8±3.2 vs. 11.6±2.7; p<0.001). BrANOS reliably predicted the 
survival with a ROC area under the curve of 0.733. The scale of >14 predicted 
death with 100% accuracy. All the patients without disability had a BrANOS score 
of <10. The BrANOS score also correlated well with GOS (p<0.001). The 2-year 
life expectancy rate was 31% in patients who survived more than 24 hours after a 
cardiac arrest.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that BrANOS provided reliable data 
for prognostic evaluation after a cardiac arrest.

Many high-resolution crystal structures have contributed to our understanding of 
the reaction pathway for catalysis by DNA and RNA polymerases, but the 
structural basis of nonenzymatic template-directed RNA replication has not been 
studied in comparable detail. Here we present crystallographic studies of the 
binding of ribonucleotide monomers to RNA primer-template complexes, with the 
goal of improving our understanding of the mechanism of nonenzymatic RNA 
copying, and of catalysis by polymerases. To explore how activated 
ribonucleotides recognize and bind to RNA templates, we synthesized an 
unreactive phosphonate-linked pyrazole analogue of guanosine 
5'-phosphoro-2-methylimidazolide (2-MeImpG), a highly activated nucleotide that 
has been used extensively to study nonenzymatic primer extension. We 
cocrystallized this analogue with structurally rigidified RNA primer-template 
complexes carrying single or multiple monomer binding sites, and obtained 
high-resolution X-ray structures of these complexes. In addition to Watson-Crick 
base pairing, we repeatedly observed noncanonical guanine:cytidine base pairs in 
our crystal structures. In most structures, the phosphate and leaving group 
moieties of the monomers were highly disordered, while in others the distance 
from O3' of the primer to the phosphorus of the incoming monomer was too great 
to allow for reaction. We suggest that these effects significantly influence the 
rate and fidelity of nonenzymatic RNA replication, and that even primitive 
ribozyme polymerases could enhance RNA replication by enforcing Watson-Crick 
base pairing between monomers and primer-template complexes, and by bringing the 
reactive functional groups into closer proximity.

OBJECTIVE: Due to increase in elderly population as result of longer life 
expectancy and the incidence of chronic disease, greater importance should be 
given to elderly care and the needs of primary caregivers. The purpose of this 
study was to determine depression status of caregivers who were providing 
in-home healthcare services.
METHODS: This study was conducted with caregivers for 63 home-dependent patients 
who benefited from the services provided by Kartal Dr. Lutfi Kirdar Training and 
Research Hospital Family Practice Clinic between May 15, 2013 and July 1, 2013 
using a socio-demographic variables questionnaire and the Beck Depression 
Inventory. Data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U 
test, Student's-t test and chi-square test.
RESULTS: Of the total, 87.3% of survey participants were women. Average age was 
52.47 years; 73% were married, 17.5% were single, and 9.5% were widows. Monthly 
income of 50.8% of participants was between TL 1000 and 3000. Of all the 
patients, 77.8% were totally, and 22.2% were semi-dependent. Depression was 
detected in 61.1% of patient relatives who were responsible for patient 
healthcare and in 22.2% of paid professional caregivers (p=0.052). Depression 
was detected at rate of 37% in caregivers who had been providing nursing care 
for less than 1 year, 63% for those who had been caregivers for 1 to 5 years, 
and for those providing care for more than 5 years, rate was 63 %. Rate of 
depression in study participants overall was 55.6%.
CONCLUSION: Duration of providing care, dependency level of patient, and level 
of intimacy affect caregivers. They need psychological support.

Tongue strength is a useful indicator of oral function and has been found to 
decrease with aging and reduced physical functioning. The present study aimed to 
assess the relationships of tongue strength with physical function, mental 
function, and nutritional status, and also between these factors and 1-year 
outcomes, to determine whether tongue strength is related to life expectancy in 
elderly people needing nursing care. The subjects were 140 elderly individuals 
requiring needing nursing care (49 men and 91 women; ≥65 years). The 
investigated items included sex, age, activities of daily living (ADL), 
comorbidity, cognitive function, nutritional status, eating function, occlusal 
support, and tongue strength. Furthermore, a follow-up study was conducted 
1 year later, and factors related to death were identified. The mean tongue 
strength of the total 140 subjects was 20.3 ± 8.6 kPa. Tongue strength was 
assessed relative to each of the investigated items, using the t test and 
one-way analysis of variance. Tongue strength was significantly related to ADL, 
comorbidity, cognitive function, calf circumference, food intake, and occlusal 
support. Fifteen subjects were found to have died at the 1-year follow-up study. 
We assessed the relationships of 1-year outcomes with each of the factors 
examined, and 1-year outcomes were found to be significantly related to ADL and 
tongue strength.

INTRODUCTION: The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class has 
grown in the last decade, with several agents available in the UK. However there 
is currently a paucity of evidence regarding the relative cost-effectiveness of 
liraglutide 1.2 mg versus other daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists, due 
to a lack of head-to-head trial data. Therefore the present analysis was 
performed, using results from a network meta-analysis (NMA), to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of three currently available daily administered GLP-1 
receptor agonists for treatment of diabetes in the UK setting.
METHODS: A validated and published diabetes model was used to make long-term 
projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2015 GBP) for patients 
receiving liraglutide 1.2 mg once-daily, exenatide 10 μg twice daily and 
lixisenatide 20 μg once-daily. Treatment effects were taken from an NMA 
evaluating the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and were applied in a cohort 
based on the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 (LEAD-6) trial. Costs 
and utilities were based on published sources.
RESULTS: Liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with improved quality-adjusted life 
expectancy versus exenatide [9.19 versus 9.17 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs)] and lixisenatide (9.19 versus 9.12 QALYs). Improvements were driven by 
benefits in glycemic control, leading to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related 
complications. Liraglutide 1.2 mg was associated with reduced costs versus 
exenatide (GBP 36,394 versus GBP 36,547) and lixisenatide (GBP 36,394 versus 
GBP 36,496), with cost savings as a result of complications avoided entirely 
offsetting increased acquisition costs. Based on the projected outcomes, 
liraglutide was found to be dominant over both exenatide and lixisenatide.
CONCLUSION: Liraglutide 1.2 mg is likely to be considered cost-effective versus 
alternative daily administered GLP-1 receptor agonists for treatment of type 2 
diabetes in the UK.

Randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
of 'Families for Health', a family-based childhood obesity treatment 
intervention delivered in a community setting for ages 6 to 11 years.

S, Stallard N, Petrou S, Simkiss D, Harrison E, Kim SW, Thorogood M.

BACKGROUND: Effective programmes to help children manage their weight are 
required. 'Families for Health' focuses on a parenting approach, designed to 
help parents develop their parenting skills to support lifestyle change within 
the family. Families for Health version 1 showed sustained reductions in mean 
body mass index (BMI) z-score after 2 years in a pilot project.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT).
DESIGN: The trial was a multicentre, investigator-blind RCT, with a parallel 
economic and process evaluation, with follow-up at 3 and 12 months. 
Randomisation was by family unit, using a 1 : 1 allocation by telephone 
registration, stratified by three sites, with a target of 120 families.
SETTING: Three sites in the West Midlands, England, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 6-11 years who were overweight (≥ 91st centile BMI) 
or obese (≥ 98th centile BMI), and their parents/carers. Recruitment was via 
referral or self-referral.
INTERVENTIONS: Families for Health version 2 is a 10-week, family-based 
community programme with parallel groups for parents and children, addressing 
parenting, lifestyle, social and emotional development. Usual care was the 
treatment for childhood obesity provided within each locality.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Joint primary outcome measures were change in children's 
BMI z-score and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at 
12 months' follow-up (QALYs were calculated using the European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions Youth version). Secondary outcome measures included changes in 
children's waist circumference, percentage body fat, physical activity, 
fruit/vegetable consumption and quality of life. Parents' BMI and mental 
well-being, family eating/activity, parent-child relationships and parenting 
style were also assessed. The process evaluation documented recruitment, reach, 
dose delivered, dose received and fidelity, using mixed methods.
RESULTS: The study recruited 115 families (128 children; 63 boys and 65 girls), 
with 56 families randomised to the Families for Health arm and 59 to the 
'usual-care' control arm. There was 80% retention of families at 3 months 
(Families for Health, 46 families; usual care, 46 families) and 72% retention at 
12 months (Families for Health, 44 families; usual care, 39 families). The 
change in BMI z-score at 12 months was not significantly different in the 
Families for Health arm and the usual-care arm [0.114, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) -0.001 to 0.229; p = 0.053]. However, within-group analysis showed that the 
BMI z-score was significantly reduced in the usual-care arm (-0.118, 95% CI 
-0.203 to -0.034; p = 0.007), but not in the Families for Health arm (-0.005, 
95% CI -0.085 to 0.078; p = 0.907). There was only one significant difference 
between groups for secondary outcomes. The economic evaluation, taking a NHS and 
Personal Social Services perspective, showed that mean costs 12 months post 
randomisation were significantly higher for Families for Health than for usual 
care (£998 vs. £548; p < 0.001). The mean incremental cost-effectiveness of 
Families for Health was estimated at £552,175 per QALY gained. The probability 
that the Families for Health programme is cost-effective did not exceed 40% 
across a range of thresholds. The process evaluation demonstrated that the 
programme was implemented, as planned, to the intended population and any 
adjustments did not deviate widely from the handbook. Many families waited more 
than 3 months to receive the intervention. Facilitators', parents' and 
children's experiences of Families for Health were largely positive and there 
were no adverse events. Further analysis could explore why some children show a 
clinically significant benefit while others have a worse outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Families for Health was neither effective nor cost-effective for 
the management of obesity in children aged 6-11 years, in comparison with usual 
care. Further exploration of the wide range of responses in BMI z-score in 
children following the Families for Health and usual-care interventions is 
warranted, focusing on children who had a clinically significant benefit and 
those who showed a worse outcome with treatment. Further research could focus on 
the role of parents in the prevention of obesity, rather than treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term safety and tolerability of naloxegol with 
placebo in patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and noncancer pain.
DESIGN: Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 
3 extension study (KODIAC-07, NCT01395524).
SETTING: Clinical investigation centers in the United States.
PATIENTS: Adult outpatients (N = 302) with confirmed OIC who had completed a 
12-week pivotal phase 3 study (KODIAC-04, NCT01309841).
INTERVENTIONS: Daily oral administration of naloxegol (12.5 and 25 mg) or 
placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse events (AEs), including treatment-related AEs, 
serious AEs, and AEs of special interest; changes from baseline to week 12 in 
pain scores, daily opioid dose, and symptoms and quality-of-life measurements.
RESULTS: No important new AEs occurred during this extension study compared with 
KODIAC-04. AEs occurred more frequently with naloxegol 25 mg (41.2 percent) 
versus naloxegol 12.5 mg (34.0 percent) and placebo (33.0 percent). 
Treatment-emergent AEs occurring in >5 percent of patients in either naloxegol 
group during the treatment period were arthralgia (25 mg; 5.2 percent) and 
diarrhea (12.5 mg; 5.3 percent); two reported AEs attributable to opioid 
withdrawal syndrome in naloxegol groups were deemed unrelated to study 
medication. None of the gastrointestinal serious AEs was adjudicated as bowel 
perforation; one patient (naloxegol 12.5 mg) had an event adjudicated as a major 
cardiovascular event and was unrelated to study medication. Pain scores and 
daily opioid dose were unchanged, and improvements in symptoms and 
quality-of-life observed in KODIAC-04 were maintained throughout the extension 
study.
CONCLUSION: Naloxegol was generally safe and well tolerated in this 12-week 
extension study in patients with noncancer pain and OIC.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of daclatasvir in 
patients whose hepatitis C threatens their life expectancy. The Named Patient 
Program in Europe included patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C, a life 
expectancy of less than 12 months and no other treatment options.
METHODS: A retrospective multi-country cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis 
C who received daclatasvir as part of the Named Patient Program in Austria, 
Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Treatment response 
was defined as a sustained virologic response (unquantifiable hepatitis C RNA) 
at 12 weeks post treatment. We summarised the characteristics of the patients in 
this cohort and estimated the rate of sustained virologic response for patients 
receiving daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin using 
hierarchical Bayesian modelling.
RESULTS: The 249 patients included had a median age of 56 years; most were male 
(78%), hepatitis C genotype 1 (75%), treatment experienced (65%) and with 
decompensated cirrhosis (59%). Many had had a liver transplant before receiving 
daclatasvir (40%). Of the 249 patients, 242 patients received daclatasvir and 
sofosbuvir and either reached 12 weeks post treatment or died during (n = 9) or 
after treatment (n = 4) or were lost to follow up during treatment (n = 1). The 
estimated rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post treatment was 
87% (95% credible interval 75 to 94%) for previously treated genotype 1 patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Daclatasvir with sofosbuvir is an effective treatment in clinical 
practice for hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Many cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
are characterized by a metabolic rewiring with increased glucose uptake and 
lactate production, termed as aerobic glycolysis. Targeting aerobic glycolysis 
presents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. This study investigates the 
therapeutic potential of glycolysis blockage by targeting 
phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in HNSCC.
METHODS: 1-(4-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one (PFK15) was used as a 
selective antagonist of PFKFB3. Glycolytic flux was determined by measuring 
glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP yield. PFKFB3 expression was examined 
using HNSCC tissue arrays. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and motility were 
analysed. HNSCC xenograft mouse model and metastasis mouse model were 
established to examine the therapeutic efficacy of PFK15 in vivo.
RESULTS: HNSCC showed an increased PFKFB3 expression compared with adjacent 
mucosal tissues (P < 0.01). Targeting PFKFB3 via PFK15 significantly reduced the 
glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP generation in HNSCC cell lines. PFK15 
suppressed cell proliferation, halted cell cycle progression and induced cell 
apoptosis. The invadopodia of HNSCC cells was markedly reduced after PFK15 
treatment, thereby impairing cell motility and extracellular matrix degradation 
ability. The in vivo data from the xenograft mice models proved that PFK15 
administration suppressed the tumor growth. And the results from the metastatic 
mice models showed administration of PFK15 alleviated the lung metastasis of 
HNSCC and extended the life expectancy of mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 via PFK15 suppressed tumor 
growth and alleviated metastasis in HNSCC, offering a promising strategy for 
cancer therapy.

CONTEXT: Accurately estimating the life expectancy of critically ill patients 
with metastatic or advanced cancer is a crucial step in planning appropriate 
palliative or supportive care.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of laboratory tests performed within two 
days of hospital admission to predict the likelihood of death within 14 days.
METHODS: We retrospectively selected patients 18 years or older with metastatic 
or advanced cancer who were admitted to intensive care units or palliative and 
supportive care services in our hospital. We evaluated whether the following are 
independent predictors in a logistic regression model: age, sex, comorbidities, 
and the results of seven commonly available laboratory tests. The end point was 
death within 14 days in or out of the hospital.
RESULTS: Of 901 patients in the development cohort and 45% died within 14 days. 
The risk of death within 14 days after admission increased with increasing age, 
lactate dehydrogenase levels, and white blood cell counts and decreasing albumin 
levels and platelet counts (P < 0.01). The model predictions were confirmed 
using a separate validation cohort. The areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves were 0.74 and 0.70 for the development and validation 
cohorts, respectively, indicating good discriminatory ability for the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that laboratory test results performed within 
two days of admission are valuable in predicting death within 14 days for 
patients with metastatic or advanced cancer. Such results may provide an 
objective assessment tool for physicians and help them initiate conversations 
with patients and families about end-of-life care.

Animals are naturally surrounded by a variety of microorganisms with which they 
constantly interact. Among these microbes, some live in close association with a 
host and form its microbiota. These communities are being extensively studied, 
owing to their contributions to shaping various aspects of animal physiology. 
One of these commensal species, Lactobacillus plantarum, and in particular the 
L.p.WJL strain, has been shown to promote the growth of Drosophila larvae upon 
nutrient scarcity, allowing earlier metamorphosis and adult emergence compared 
with axenic individuals. As for many insects, conditions surrounding the 
post-embryonic development dictate key adult life history traits in Drosophila, 
and adjusting developmental timing according to the environment is essential for 
adult fitness. Thus, we wondered whether the growth acceleration induced by 
L.p.WJL in a context of poor nutrition could adversely impact the fitness of 
Drosophila adults. Here, we show that the L.p.WJL -mediated acceleration of 
growth is not deleterious; adults emerging after an accelerated development are 
as fit as their axenic siblings. Additionally, the presence of L.p.WJL even 
leads to a lifespan extension in nutritionally challenged males. These results 
demonstrate that L.p.WJL is a beneficial partner for Drosophila melanogaster 
through its entire life cycle. Thus, commensal bacteria allow the earlier 
emergence and longer survival of fit and fertile individuals and might represent 
one of the factors contributing to the ecological success of Drosophila.

Aging is a natural process characterized by several biological changes. In this 
context, oxidative stress appears as a key factor that leads cells and organisms 
to severe dysfunctions and diseases. To cope with reactive oxygen species and 
oxidative-related damage, there has been increased use of superoxide dismutase 
(SOD)/catalase (CAT) biomimetic compounds. Recently, we have shown that three 
metal-based compounds {[Fe(HPClNOL)Cl2]NO3, [Cu(HPClNOL)(CH3CN)](ClO4)2 and 
Mn(HPClNOL)(Cl)2}, harboring in vitro SOD and/or CAT activities, were critical 
for protection of yeast cells against oxidative stress. In this work, treating 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae with these SOD/CAT mimics (25.0 µM/1 h), we highlight 
the pivotal role of these compounds to extend the life span of yeast during 
chronological aging. Evaluating lipid and protein oxidation of aged cells, it 
becomes evident that these mimics extend the life expectancy of yeast mainly due 
to the reduction in oxidative stress biomarkers. In addition, the treatment of 
yeast cells with these mimics regulated the amounts of lipid droplet occurrence, 
consistent with the requirement and protection of lipids for cell integrity 
during aging. Concerning SOD/CAT mimics uptake, using inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry, we add new evidence that these complexes, besides being 
bioabsorbed by S. cerevisiae cells, can also affect metal homeostasis. Finally, 
our work presents a new application for these SOD/CAT mimics, which demonstrate 
a great potential to be employed as antiaging agents. Taken together, these 
promising results prompt future studies concerning the relevance of 
administration of these molecules against the emerging aging-related diseases 
such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate and analyze the evolution of mortality rates of 
gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in Peru and its regions between 2005-2014.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a nationwide secondary analysis of Peru's 
Health Ministry registry of deaths during the period 2005-2014, with a focus on 
regional differences. Deaths registered with codes C15 to C25 (malignant 
neoplasms of digestive organs) from the ICD-10 were included. Calculation of 
age-standarized mortality rates and years of life lost (YLL) due to GI cancer 
per 100,000 habitants were also performed.
RESULTS: Data of 67,527 deaths from GI cancers was analyzed, 35,055 (51.91%) 
were women. In 2005, the number of GI cancer deaths was 6,484, for 2014, 7,532 
cases were recorded. The GI cancer age-standarized mortality rates at the 
country level showed a decrease of 12.70% between 2005-2014. Stomach cancer 
presented the highest age-standarized mortality rate despite showing a downward 
trend in the last years, equal for gallbladder, liver and biliary tract, and 
esophagus cancer. Colorectal, small intestine and anus cancer show a progressive 
increase. In 2014, Callao (48.8), Huancavelica (48.5), La Libertad (39.6), 
Lambayeque (40.5) and Huanuco (38.9) had the highest rates. The three types of 
GI cancers with the highest rates of YLL in 2014 were stomach cancer (118.51), 
followed by liver and biliary tract cancer (58.68) and colorectal (44.86).
CONCLUSION: GI cancer mortality in Peru is high and a priority issue in regions 
like Huancavelica, Huanuco, Callao, La Libertad and Lambayeque. Stomach cancer 
remains the most frequent GI cancer, but with a downward trend in the study
