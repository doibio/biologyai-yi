Theories of natural language and concepts have been unable to model the 
flexibility, creativity, context-dependence, and emergence, exhibited by words, 
concepts and their combinations. The mathematical formalism of quantum theory 
has instead been successful in capturing these phenomena such as graded 
membership, situational meaning, composition of categories, and also more 
complex decision making situations, which cannot be modeled in traditional 
probabilistic approaches. We show how a formal quantum approach to concepts and 
their combinations can provide a powerful extension of prototype theory. We 
explain how prototypes can interfere in conceptual combinations as a consequence 
of their contextual interactions, and provide an illustration of this using an 
intuitive wave-like diagram. This quantum-conceptual approach gives new life to 
original prototype theory, without however making it a privileged concept 
theory, as we explain at the end of our paper.

In five studies (total N = 1300) we developed and validated a Polish version of 
the Dirty Dozen measure (DTDD-P) that measures the three traits of the Dark 
Triad, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. We detail the presence and 
stability of a bifactor structure of the 12 items and present evidence for good 
internal consistency and test-retest reliability. We examine the nomological 
network surrounding the Dark Triad and show that both the Dark Triad total score 
and the subscales have acceptable validity. We also present evidence on the Dark 
Triad and moral behavior. Dark Triad predicts utilitarian moral choice (e.g., 
approval for sacrificing somebody's life for the sake of saving others) and this 
link is mediated by low empathic concern. In total, our results suggest that the 
Polish Dirty Dozen-Parszywa Dwunastka-is valid, stable, and useful for the study 
of lingering puzzles in the literature.

The social and economic burden of diabetes is large and growing. Diabetes is a 
significant public health issue in the Appalachian region; women constitute 
approximately 50% of those diagnosed with diabetes. This cross-sectional study 
examined the relationship among sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and 
psychosocial factors (cognitive and affective representations) and perceived 
risk of diabetes in non-diabetic, non-elderly (21-50 years) Appalachian women 
residing in West Virginia (N = 202). Participants were recruited through social 
media, flyers, and a newsletter from the West Virginia University Extension. The 
final survey was conducted from March 2015 to June 2015. Bivariate analyses were 
used to examine unadjusted relations among sociodemographic, anthropometric, 
lifestyle, and psychosocial factors and comparative perceived risk of diabetes. 
In a multivariable logistic regression model, we found that younger age, higher 
body mass index, non-White race, greater diabetes knowledge, personal control, 
and moderate amounts of physical activity were significantly, positively 
associated with higher diabetes risk perception (p < .05). Our results indicated 
that diabetes knowledge, personal control, and physical activity were related to 
diabetes risk perception among Appalachian women. Understanding perceived 
diabetes-related risk may aid in the development of effective intervention 
strategies to reduce the burden of diabetes among Appalachian and other 
populations. These cross-sectional findings need further evaluation in 
longitudinal studies.

Non-essential "heavy" metals such as cadmium tend to accumulate in an organism 
and thus are a particular threat for long-lived animals. Here we show that two 
unrelated, short-lived groups of mammals (rodents and shrews, separated by 100 
Mio years of evolution) each have independently acquired mutations in their 
metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF-1) in a domain relevant for robust 
transcriptional induction by zinc and cadmium. While key amino acids are mutated 
in rodents, in shrews an entire exon is skipped. Rodents and especially shrews 
are unique regarding the alterations of this region. To investigate the 
biological relevance of these alterations, MTF-1s from the common shrew (Sorex 
araneus), the mouse, humans and a bat (Myotis blythii), were tested by 
cotransfection with a reporter gene into cells lacking MTF-1. Whereas shrews 
only live for 1.5-2.5 years, bats, although living on a very similar insect 
diet, have a lifespan of several decades. We find that bat MTF-1 is similarly 
metal-responsive as its human counterpart, while shrew MTF-1 is less responsive, 
similar to mouse MTF-1. We propose that in comparison to most other mammals, the 
short-lived shrews and rodents can afford a "lower-quality" system for heavy 
metal homeostasis and detoxification.

BACKGROUND: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare, 
debilitating, and life-threatening disease. We investigated associations between 
markers of disease severity and long-term outcomes in patients with inoperable 
CTEPH or persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary 
endarterectomy (PEA) who were receiving the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator 
riociguat. We also present safety and efficacy from the final data cutoff of 
CHEST-2, where most patients had received riociguat for at least 2 years.
METHODS: Eligible patients from the CHEST-1 study entered the CHEST-2 open-label 
extension study, in which all patients received riociguat individually adjusted 
to a maximum dose of 2·5 mg three times per day. The primary endpoint was safety 
and tolerability. We did exploratory assessments of associations between markers 
of disease severity (6-min walking distance [6MWD], N-terminal prohormone of 
brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] concentration, and WHO functional class) 
at baseline and follow-up with overall survival and clinical worsening-free 
survival. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. CHEST-2 is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00910429.
FINDINGS: 237 patients entered CHEST-2. At 2 years, overall survival was 93% 
(95% CI 89-96) and clinical worsening-free survival was 82% (77-87). A 
significant association with overall survival was seen for 6MWD and NT-proBNP 
concentration at baseline (p=0·0199 and p=0·0183, respectively) and at follow-up 
(p=0·0385 and p=0·0068, respectively). Change from baseline in 6MWD was also 
significantly associated with survival (p=0·0047). WHO functional class at 
baseline and follow-up showed no significant association with overall survival 
but was associated with clinical worsening-free survival. Riociguat was well 
tolerated by most patients and no new safety signals were identified. Serious 
adverse events were seen in 129 (54%) of 237 patients, and 14 (6%) discontinued 
riociguat therapy because of adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: Riociguat may be used long term in patients with CTEPH. 6MWD and 
NT-proBNP concentration are good prognostic markers.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a chronic disease associated with 
poor long-term outcomes. Identifying predictors of long-term outcome in 
pulmonary arterial hypertension is important to assess disease severity and 
guide treatment. We investigate associations between efficacy parameters and 
long-term outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving 
riociguat in the PATENT-2 study. We also present safety and efficacy data from 
the final data cutoff of PATENT-2, where most patients had received at least 2 
years of riociguat treatment.
METHODS: Eligible patients from the PATENT-1 study entered the PATENT-2 
open-label extension, which will continue until all patients transition to the 
commercial drug. All patients received riociguat individually adjusted to a 
maximum dose of 2·5 mg three times a day. The primary endpoint was safety and 
tolerability, assessed with recording adverse events, serious adverse events, 
discontinuations, and deaths; exploratory assessments included 6-min walking 
distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, N-terminal prohormone of brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)concentrations, Borg dyspnoea score, 
health-related quality of life (EQ-5D score), survival, and clinical 
worsening-free survival. Association between efficacy parameters and long-term 
outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and a Cox proportional-hazards 
regression model. PATENT-2 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00863681.
FINDINGS: 396 patients entered PATENT-2, of whom 197 patients were receiving 
riociguat monotherapy and 199 were receiving riociguat in combination with 
endothelin receptor antagonists or prostanoids, or both. A significant 
association was noted between 6MWD, NT-proBNP concentration, and WHO functional 
class and overall survival at baseline (p=0·0006, 0·0225, and 0·0191, 
respectively), and at follow-up (p=0·021, 0·0056, and 0·0048, respectively). 
Riociguat was well tolerated in PATENT-2. Serious adverse events were recorded 
in 238 (60%) of the total population, and 45 (11%) patients discontinued 
treatment because of an adverse event. Improvements in 6MWD, WHO functional 
class, and NT-proBNP concentrations were maintained after 2 years of treatment.
INTERPRETATION: These results support the long-term use of riociguat in patients 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and emphasise the prognostic value of 
6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP concentrations.

BACKGROUND: In 2014, lurasidone, an atypical antipsychotic, was approved for the 
treatment of schizophrenia in adults. It is an alternative treatment option to 
aripiprazole, and when compared with aripiprazole, lurasidone was associated 
with improved symptom reduction and reduced risk of weight gain and relapse. We 
conducted a cost-utility analysis of lurasidone versus aripiprazole from the 
perspective of healthcare services, using Scotland and Wales as specific case 
studies.
METHODS: A 10-year Markov model, incorporating a 6-week acute phase and a 
maintenance phase across three health states (discontinuation, relapse, death) 
was constructed. Six-week probabilities of discontinuation and adverse events 
were based on a published independent mixed-treatment comparison; long-term 
risks of relapse and discontinuation were from an indirect comparison. Costs 
included drug therapy, relapse, and outpatient, primary and residential care. 
Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5 %. Utility estimates were taken from 
published literature, and cost effectiveness was expressed as total 10-year 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Lurasidone yielded a cost saving of £3383 and an improvement of 0.005 
QALYs versus aripiprazole, in Scotland. Deterministic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that results were sensitive to relapse rates, while probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis suggested that lurasidone had the highest expected net 
benefit at willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20,000-30,000 per QALY. The 
probability that lurasidone was a cost-effective treatment strategy was 
approximately 75 % at all willingness-to-pay thresholds, with similar results 
being obtained for the Welsh analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that lurasidone would provide an effective, 
cost-saving alternative for the healthcare service in the treatment of adult 
patients with schizophrenia.

We aimed to review and summarize the evidence from accomplished trials analyzing 
factors influencing mortality in patients with T2DM and to provide some 
recommendations for targets and treatment in the European region. The following 
databases were searched for relevant trials: PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Of 
3.806 citations, 134 trials met our inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The reduction in lifetime for 65 + -years-old patients having less than 
10 years T2DM amounts to 1.8 years. Having T2DM for more than 10 years lifetime 
will be reduced by 2.7 years. However, the lifetime shortening factor of T2DM 
will even be stronger for 40 + -years-old patients at onset. Males will lose 
11.6 years of life and 18.6 QUALYs. T2DM among females will reduce life by 14 
QUALYs by 22 years. From a statistical point of view, the highest mortality rate 
will occur in an over 55-years-old European smoking and non-compliant diabetic 
woman with alcohol abuse living in a rural area with a low level of education 
and a low socio-economic status. Furthermore, other co-morbidities such as 
cardiovascular diseases, gout, and depression affect mortality. Additionally, 
mortality will increase with a BMI over 35 and also with a BMI under 20-25. This 
refers to the obesity paradox indicating a higher mortality rate among normal 
weight patients with T2DM compared to overweight patients with T2DM. 
HbA1c-levels between 6.5 % and 7 % are associated with the lowest impact on 
mortality.

According to disease avoidance theory, selective pressures have shaped adaptive 
behaviours to avoid people who might transmit infections. Such behavioural 
immune defence strategies may have social and societal consequences. 
Attractiveness is perceived as a heuristic cue of good health, and the relative 
importance of attractiveness is predicted to increase during high disease 
threat. Here, we investigated whether politicians' attractiveness is more 
important for electoral success when disease threat is high, in an effort to 
replicate earlier findings from the USA. We performed a cross-sectional study of 
484 members of the House of Commons from England and Wales. Publicly available 
sexiness ratings (median 5883 ratings/politician) were regressed on measures of 
disease burden, operationalized as infant mortality, life expectancy and 
self-rated health. Infant mortality in parliamentary constituencies did not 
significantly predict sexiness of elected members of parliament (p = 0.08), nor 
did life expectancy (p = 0.06), nor self-rated health (p = 0.55). Subsample 
analyses failed to provide further support for the hypothesis. In conclusion, an 
attractive leader effect was not amplified by disease threat in the UK and these 
results did not replicate those of earlier studies from the USA concerning the 
relationship between attractiveness, disease threat and voting preference.

Age Patterns in Mental Representations of Time: Underlying Constructs and 
Relevant Covariates.

Rutt JL(1), Löckenhoff CE(1).

Author information:
(1)a Department of Human Development , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , 
USA.

BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: Research suggests that mental representations of time 
encompass multiple distinct aspects that vary with age, but prior studies rarely 
assessed more than one aspect of time perception and did not systematically 
consider relevant covariates. This lack of integration across studies hampers 
theory building and limits a deeper understanding of underlying constructs.
METHODS: Five widely used and conceptually distinct measures of time perception 
(i.e., perceived life position, global future horizons, future orientation and 
planning, self-continuity, and the temporal extension of episodic future 
thought) were administered to a demographically stratified adult life-span 
sample. Theoretically implicated covariates, including cognition, current 
affect, personality, and subjective health, were also assessed.
RESULTS: Principle component analyses suggested a four-component solution. 
Perceived life position and global future horizons formed a single component 
reflecting subjective life span; the remaining measures each constituted 
separate components. The life span component and episodic future thought were 
negatively associated with age, self-continuity was positively associated with 
age, and future orientation did not vary by age. Among the covariates, mental 
and physical health showed the most pronounced associations with time 
perceptions, but the direction of effects varied across components.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that mental representations of time encompass 
multiple components that show distinct age patterns and associations with 
covariates. Implications for theory building and practical applications are 
discussed.

This clinical report describes a child suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea 
(OSA) and class II skeletal malocclusion with maxillary contraction and anterior 
open bite. He presented moderate obstructive sleep apnoea with large impact on 
quality of life of patient and parents. He was treated using an innovative 
orthodontic device (Sleep Apnea Twin Expander) to simultaneously carry out 
palatal expansion and mandibular advancement. After orthodontic therapy, the 
OSA-18 questionnaire demonstrated an improvement of the main respiratory 
symptoms, while cardiorespiratory sleep study revealed a reduction in 
obstructive sleep apnoea events. Post-treatment, clinical assessment and 
cephalometric analysis showed a reduction of sagittal maxillary discrepancy and 
an extension of upper airway space. In conclusion, this case report suggests 
that orthodontic treatment might be a valuable alternative treatment in children 
with obstructive sleep apnoea related to craniofacial anomalies.

palato e l’avanzamento mandibolare contemporaneamente. Dopo la terapia 
ortodontica, il questionario sulla qualità della vita ha evidenziato un 
miglioramento dei principali sintomi respiratori e lo studio cardiorespiratorio 
del sonno ha rivelato una riduzione degli eventi di apnee ostruttive. Al termine 
della terapia, la valutazione clinica e l’analisi cefalometrica hanno 
evidenziato una riduzione della discrepanza sagittale e verticale tra il 
mascellare superiore e la mandibola e un ampliamento dello spazio delle vie 
aeree superiori. In conclusione, questo case report suggerisce che il 
trattamento ortodontico può essere una valida terapia alternativa nei bambini 
con apnea ostruttiva del sonno associata ad anomalie cranio-facciali.

OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to examine the trend of major clinical 
biochemistry factors associated with cardiovascular diseases and dyslipidemia 
onset over a 10-year period (2000-2010) in Oil and Gas workers.
METHODS: The information extracted from "Computerized management of individual 
medical services database" regarding 439 Italian workers of an oil and gas 
company were analysed.
RESULTS: A constant and significant increase of the average Body Mass Index and 
serum cholesterol were found, and in particular in workers < 36 years: BMI was 
24.4 (2000) and 25.8 (2010) with p < 0.001, and cholesterol was 188.3 mg/dL 
(2000) and 206.5 mg/dL (2010) with p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: Analysed variables are the most important risk factor for 
cardiovascular, neurological and neoplastic diseases, as well as they reduce 
life expectancy. Occupational medicine in particular in extreme working 
environmental conditions, such as for workers in oil and gas companies, 
monitoring health status and promoting healthy life style, has a strategic role 
to perform cost-effective strategies to reduce health risks, thus improving the 
workers lifestyle.

BACKGROUND: The role of the caregiver has received increasing attention in 
recent years. This is due in part to today's longer life expectancy, which has 
resulted in a larger population affected by chronic pathologies. But it is also 
due to the lack of suitable solutions provided by the social and health 
structures. This research aims to investigate in depth the characteristics and 
the needs of caregivers involved with adult and paediatric patients who are 
receiving treatment for acute pathologies in hospitals. Study Design. 
Questionnaire.
METHODS: A questionnaire was used that was validated in a previous study. It was 
administered in the period from March 2014 to January 2015 at the Fondazione 
IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano in six wards. The 
questionnaire was anonymous.
RESULTS: We administered 364 questionnaires which enabled us to identify the 
characteristics of adult and paediatric patients' caregivers. Those in hospitals 
are prevalently women. Adult patients' caregivers tend to be from 40 to 79 years 
of age, those of paediatric patients from 20 to 59. Adult patients' caregivers 
may often be the husband/wife (35%), or a son/daughter (32%). Paediatric 
patients' caregivers for paediatric patients are almost always parents (97%). 
The states of mind and the sensations felt by caregivers are anxiety and 
tension.
CONCLUSION: The increasing number and severity of the conditions of people 
needing care, the changing family composition and the economic crisis have 
compelled caregivers to perform tasks requiring technical skills that should not 
be expected from them, but which the circumstances do not allow them to evade. 
It emerges from an analysis of the data provided by this research that a more 
complete use could be made of caregivers' potentials by involving them to a 
greater extent in the care process by the healthcare providers.

COUNTRY-LEVEL SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH SURVIVAL PROBABILITY OF 
BECOMING A CENTENARIAN AMONG OLDER EUROPEAN ADULTS: GENDER INEQUALITY, MALE

This study confirms an association between survival probability of becoming a 
centenarian (SPBC) for those aged 65 to 69 and country-level socioeconomic 
indicators in Europe: the gender inequality index (GII), male labour force 
participation (MLP) rates and proportions of seats held by women in national 
parliaments (PWP). The analysis was based on SPBC data from 34 countries 
obtained from the United Nations (UN). Country-level socioeconomic indicator 
data were obtained from the UN and World Bank databases. The associations 
between socioeconomic indicators and SPBC were assessed using correlation 
coefficients and multivariate regression models. The findings show significant 
correlations between the SPBC for women and men aged 65 to 69 and country-level 
socioeconomic indicators: GII (r=-0.674, p=0.001), MLP (r=0.514, p=0.002) and 
PWP (r=0.498, p=0.003). The SPBC predictors for women and men were lower GIIs 
and higher MLP and PWP (R 2=0.508, p=0.001). Country-level socioeconomic 
indicators appear to have an important effect on the probability of becoming a 
centenarian in European adults aged 65 to 69. Country-level gender equality 
policies in European counties may decrease the risk of unhealthy old age and 
increase longevity in elders through greater national gender equality; 
disparities in GII and other country-level socioeconomic indicators impact 
longevity probability. National longevity strategies should target country-level 
gender inequality.

Dietary regimens have proven to delay aging and age-associated diseases in 
several eukaryotic model organisms but the input of nutritional balance to 
longevity regulation is still poorly understood. Here, we present data on the 
role of single carbon and nitrogen sources and their interplay in yeast 
longevity. Data demonstrate that ammonium, a rich nitrogen source, decreases 
chronological life span (CLS) of the prototrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
strain PYCC 4072 in a concentration-dependent manner and, accordingly, that CLS 
can be extended through ammonium restriction, even in conditions of initial 
glucose abundance. We further show that CLS extension depends on initial 
ammonium and glucose concentrations in the growth medium, as long as other 
nutrients are not limiting. Glutamine, another rich nitrogen source, induced CLS 
shortening similarly to ammonium, but this effect was not observed with the poor 
nitrogen source urea. Ammonium decreased yeast CLS independently of the 
metabolic process activated during aging, either respiration or fermentation, 
and induced replication stress inhibiting a proper cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 
phase. The present results shade new light on the nutritional equilibrium as a 
key factor on cell longevity and may contribute for the definition of 
interventions to promote life span and healthy aging.

Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH. Hsiche@ccf.org.

Heart transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with Stage D 
heart failure with a median life expectancy of ≈10 to 15 years. Unfortunately, 
many patients die on the waiting list hoping for a chance of survival. The life 
boat cannot rescue everyone. Over a decade, the donor pool has remained 
relatively stable, whereas the number of heart transplant candidates has risen. 
Potential recipients often have many comorbidities and are older because the 
criteria for heart transplantation has few absolute contraindications. Women, 
Hispanics, and patients with restrictive heart disease and congenital heart 
disease are more likely to die while awaiting heart transplantation than men, 
white patients, and those with either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. To 
better match the market, we need to (1) increase the donor pool, (2) reduce the 
waitlist, and (3) improve the allocation system. This review article addresses 
all 3 options and compares strategies in the United States to those in other 
countries.

Cofilin Activation Is Temporally Associated with the Cessation of Growth in the 
Developing Hippocampus.

Dendritic extension and synaptogenesis proceed at high rates in rat hippocampus 
during early postnatal life but markedly slow during the third week of 
development. The reasons for the latter, fundamental event are poorly 
understood. Here, we report that levels of phosphorylated (inactive) cofilin, an 
actin depolymerizing factor, decrease by 90% from postnatal days (pnds) 10 to 
21. During the same period, levels of total and phosphorylated Arp2, which 
nucleates actin branches, increase. A search for elements that could explain the 
switch from inactive to active cofilin identified reductions in β1 integrin, 
TrkB, and LIM domain kinase 2b, upstream proteins that promote cofilin 
phosphorylation. Moreover, levels of slingshot 3, which dephosphorylates 
cofilin, increase during the period in which growth slows. Consistent with the 
cofilin results, in situ phalloidin labeling of F-actin demonstrated that spines 
and dendrites contained high levels of dynamic actin filaments during Week 2, 
but these fell dramatically by pnd 21. The results suggest that the change from 
inactive to constitutively active cofilin leads to a loss of dynamic actin 
filaments needed for process extension and thus the termination of spine 
formation and synaptogenesis. The relevance of these events to the emergence of 
memory-related synaptic plasticity is described.

Nebraska Medical Center, College of Public Health, Omaha, NE 68198-4365, USA.

This study examined the association between unemployment and life expectancy in 
the United States during 1990-2010. Census-based unemployment rates were linked 
to US county-level mortality data. Life expectancies were calculated by age, 
sex, race, and unemployment level during 1990-2010. Differences in life 
expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of death. Life expectancy was 
consistently lower in areas with higher unemployment rates. In 2006-2010, those 
in areas with high unemployment rates (≥9%) had a life expectancy of 76.9 years, 
compared with 80.7 years for those in areas with low unemployment rates (<3%). 
The association between unemployment and life expectancy was stronger for men 
than for women. Life expectancy ranged from 69.9 years among black men in high 
unemployment areas to 90.0 years among Asian/Pacific Islander women in low 
unemployment areas. Disparities persisted over time. In 1990-1992, life 
expectancy was 4.7 years shorter in high unemployment than in low unemployment 
areas. In 2006-2010, the life expectancy difference between the lowest and 
highest unemployment areas decreased to 3.8 years. Heart disease, cancer, 
homicide, unintentional injuries, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and liver cirrhosis 
contributed most to the lower life expectancy in high unemployment areas. High 
unemployment areas recorded larger gains in life expectancy than low 
unemployment areas, contributing to the narrowing gap during 1990-2010.

Reducing Iron Deficiency Anemia in 6-23-Month-Old-Children in Urban India.

INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major public health problem in 
India and especially harmful in early childhood due to its impact on cognitive 
development and increased all-cause mortality. We estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of price subsidies on fortified packaged infant cereals 
(F-PICs) in reducing IDA in 6-23-monthold children in urban India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness is estimated by comparing the net 
social cost of price subsidies with the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
averted with price subsidies. The net social costs correspond to the cost of the 
subsidy minus the monetary costs saved by reducing IDA. The estimation proceeds 
in three steps: 1) the current lifetime costs of IDA are assessed with a health 
economic model combining the prevalence of anemia, derived from a large 
population survey, with information on the health consequences of IDA and their 
costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and DALYs. 2) The effects of price 
subsidies on the demand for F-PICs are assessed with a market survey among 4801 
households in 12 large Indian cities. 3) The cost-effectiveness is calculated by 
combining the findings of the first two steps with the results of a systematic 
review on the effectiveness of F-PICs in reducing IDA. We compare the 
cost-effectiveness of interventions that differ in the level of the subsidy and 
in the socio-economic strata (SES) eligible for the subsidy.
RESULTS: The lifetime social costs of IDA in 6-23-month-old children in large 
Indian cities amount to production losses of 3222 USD and to 726,000 DALYs. Poor 
households incur the highest costs, yet even wealthier households suffer 
substantial losses. The market survey reveals that few households currently buy 
F-PICs, with the share ranging from 14% to 36%. Wealthier households are 
generally more likely to buy FPICs. The costs of the subsidies per DALY averted 
range from 909 to 3649 USD. Interventions targeted at poorer households are most 
effective. Almost all interventions are cost saving from a societal perspective 
when taking into account the reduction of future production losses. Return per 
DALY averted ranges between gains of 1655 USD to a cost of 411 USD.
CONCLUSION: Price subsidies on F-PICs are a cost-effective way to reduce the 
social costs of IDA in 6-23-month-old children in large Indian cities. 
Interventions targeting poorer households are especially cost-effective.

Overexpression of the Wheat Expansin Gene TaEXPA2 Improved Seed Production and 
Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco Plants.

Expansins are cell wall proteins that are grouped into two main families, 
α-expansins and β-expansins, and they are implicated in the control of cell 
extension via the disruption of hydrogen bonds between cellulose and matrix 
glucans. TaEXPA2 is an α-expansin gene identified in wheat. Based on putative 
cis-regulatory elements in the TaEXPA2 promoter sequence and the expression 
pattern induced when polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to mimic water stress, we 
hypothesized that TaEXPA2 is involved in plant drought tolerance and plant 
development. Through transient expression of 35S::TaEXPA2-GFP in onion epidermal 
cells, TaEXPA2 was localized to the cell wall. Constitutive expression of 
TaEXPA2 in tobacco improved seed production by increasing capsule number, not 
seed size, without having any effect on plant growth patterns. The transgenic 
tobacco exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to water-deficiency stress 
than did wild-type (WT) plants. We found that under drought stress, the 
transgenic plants maintained a better water status. The accumulated content of 
osmotic adjustment substances, such as proline, in TaEXPA2 transgenic plants was 
greater than that in WT plants. Transgenic plants also displayed greater 
antioxidative competence as indicated by their lower malondialdehyde (MDA) 
content, relative electrical conductivity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
accumulation than did WT plants. This result suggests that the transgenic plants 
suffer less damage from ROS under drought conditions. The activities of some 
antioxidant enzymes as well as expression levels of several genes encoding key 
antioxidant enzymes were higher in the transgenic plants than in the WT plants 
under drought stress. Collectively, our results suggest that ectopic expression 
of the wheat expansin gene TaEXPA2 improves seed production and drought 
tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants.

INTRODUCTION: The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan presents an immense 
burden to the Jordanian health system, particularly in treating chronic health 
conditions. This study was undertaken to assess utilization of health services 
for chronic health conditions among Syrian refugees in non-camp settings.
METHODS: A survey of Syrian refugees in Jordan was undertaken in June 2014 to 
characterize health seeking behaviors and issues related to accessing care for 
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, 
and arthritis. A cluster design with probability proportional to size sampling 
was used to attain a nationally representative sample of 1550 non-camp Syrian 
refugee households.
RESULTS: Of 1363 cases with a chronic health condition diagnosis, 84.7% had 
received care in Jordan. Public facilities faced a heavy burden serving over 
half (53.9%) of care-seekers; the remainder received care in the private (29.6%) 
and NGO/charity (16.6%) sectors. Individuals with non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) in the central region of Jordan and with arthritis had the lowest rates 
of care-seeking when compared to other regions and conditions. Overall, 31.6% of 
care-seekers had an out-of-pocket payment for the most recent care-seeking event
