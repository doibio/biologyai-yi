Revisiting a population-dynamic model of air pollution and daily mortality of 
the elderly in Philadelphia.

Epidemiological studies find that elderly, susceptible, and previously impaired 
individuals are more sensitive to transient air pollution exposures than healthy 
persons. However, any associated changes in life expectancy remain largely 
unresolved. Murray and Nelson published a model of daily mortality and air 
pollution that addresses mortality displacement or harvesting by directly 
considering population dynamics on the basis of the assumption that a period of 
illness or frailty precedes most elderly deaths. The underlying concept is that 
a person's response to an environmental exposure also depends on his/her 
physiological ability to withstand stress at that time. They used Kalman 
filtering to estimate an unobservable quantity--the size of the frail 
subpopulation from which elderly (ages > or = 65 yr) nontraumatic deaths are 
assumed to derive. They found a small subpopulation, relatively robust to 
environmental variations over 14 yr, with remaining life expectancies of 8-31 
days in this frail status. Here, this model and dataset are expanded to examine 
the ramifications in more detail (including seasonality), to consider peak ozone 
as an additional pollutant, and to consider remaining life expectancies of the 
this frail subpopulation on a daily basis. Previous studies of mortality 
displacement and of Philadelphia mortality-air-pollution associations are also 
summarized in general, and agreement with the Murray-Nelson model was found, 
thus supporting its validity. The estimated additional mortality associated with 
a given environmental exposure persists for a few days at most but is not always 
compensated by subsequent mortality deficits. It is concluded that the 
pollution-associated mortality increases of a few percent in this dataset are 
consistent with losses of remaining life expectancy of up to a few days. It is 
also recommended that a more complex population-dynamic model be implemented to 
examine the extent to which previous short-term environmental exposures and 
seasonal trends may also influence morbidity and thus entry into the frail 
at-risk subpopulation.

[Mortality and life span of able-bodied population in Russia: methods and 
results of studies].

[Article in Russian]

Tikhonova GI, Gorchakova TIu.

The article deals with methods to analyze mortality and life span of able-bodied 
population, including mathematical modelling methods. These methods helped to 
analyze changes in mortality, to evaluate life span in able-bodied age interval 
and damage caused by certain death causes. The authors revealed major trends in 
mortality of able-bodied population in Russia over the recent decade.

Healthier times?: revisiting Indigenous Australian health history.

Blyton G(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Newcastle.

The perception that Indigenous Australians were primitive hunters and gatherers 
who lived in a nomadic 'Stone Age' culture resonates through most narratives 
found on Indigenous people in pre-colonial times. This narrative is better 
placed in the realm of myth; I contest claims that the life expectancy of 
Indigenous Australians was only forty years in pre-colonial times, by providing 
suggestive evidence that there is a strong probability that longevity favoured 
Indigenous Australians in comparison to many poorer sectors of the European 
population living in slum habitats. As well, I will challenge notions that 
Indigenous Australians were more violent than supposedly 'civilised' nations. 
Finally I express the hope that future researchers will revisit archival sources 
to develop a more nuanced perspective on the past.

Cost effectiveness of prophylactic HPV 16/18 vaccination in Finland: results 
from a modelling exercise.

OBJECTIVES: the study aims to estimate the clinical-impact and 
cost-effectiveness value of adding human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccination 
against cervical cancer among women currently undergoing organised screening in 
Finland.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model evaluating high-risk HPV infections and cervical 
cancer (CC) cases combined with screening has been customised to the Finnish 
setting. The model outcome for a cohort of 30,000 girls aged 10 years was 
calibrated to age-specific annual number of Pap smears, CC incidence and 
mortality.
RESULTS: The observed age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CC closely 
match the data replicated by the model. The model predicts that with a 90% 
vaccine coverage rate, CC cases and mortality would be reduced by 70%. In the 
base-case analysis with a discount rate of 3% the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, from a healthcare perspective, was 
€17,294. Without discounting this value is €2,591/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that implementing prophylactic CC vaccination 
within the current screening system would substantially reduce CC cases and 
deaths, as well as the overall disease burden expressed in pre-cancer lesions 
averted. Vaccination could be a cost-effective intervention in Finland despite 
the fact that the number of CC cases and deaths are currently relatively low. 
Conservative estimates of the cost effectiveness of the vaccination were 
provided since it was not possible to assess herd protection induced by 
vaccination using this Markov model.

Estimated causes of death in Thailand, 2005: implications for health policy.

AD.

BACKGROUND: Almost 400,000 deaths are registered each year in Thailand. Their 
value for public health policy and planning is greatly diminished by incomplete 
registration of deaths and by concerns about the quality of cause-of-death 
information. This arises from misclassification of specified causes of death, 
particularly in hospitals, as well as from extensive use of ill-defined and 
vague codes to attribute the underlying cause of death. Detailed investigations 
of a sample of deaths in and out of hospital were carried out to identify 
misclassification of causes and thus derive a best estimate of national 
mortality patterns by age, sex, and cause of death.
METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 11,984 deaths in 2005 was 
selected, and verbal autopsy interviews were conducted for almost 10,000 deaths. 
Verbal autopsy procedures were validated against 2,558 cases for which medical 
record review was possible. Misclassification matrices for leading causes of 
death, including ill-defined causes, were developed separately for deaths inside 
and outside of hospitals and proportionate mortality distributions constructed. 
Estimates of mortality undercount were derived from "capture-recapture" methods 
applied to the 2005-06 Survey of Population Change. Proportionate mortality 
distributions were applied to this mortality "envelope" and ill-defined causes 
redistributed according to Global Burden of Disease methods to yield final 
estimates of mortality levels and patterns in 2005.
RESULTS: Estimated life expectancy in Thailand in 2005 was 68.5 years for males 
and 75.6 years for females, two years lower than vital registration data 
suggest. Upon correction, stroke is the leading cause of death in Thailand 
(10.7%), followed by ischemic heart disease (7.8%) and HIV/AIDS (7.4%). Other 
leading causes are road traffic accidents (males) and diabetes mellitus 
(females). In many cases, estimated mortality is at least twice what is 
estimated in vital registration. Leading causes of death have remained stable 
since 1999, with the exception of a large decline in HIV/AIDS mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Field research into the accuracy of cause-of-death data can result 
in substantially different patterns of mortality than suggested by routine death 
registration. Misclassification errors are likely to have very significant 
implications for health policy debates. Routine incorporation of validated 
verbal autopsy methods could significantly improve cause-of-death data quality 
in Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Highland areas of Africa are mostly malaria hypoendemic, due to 
climate which is not appropriate for anophelines development and their 
reproductive fitness. In view of designing a malaria control strategy in Western 
Cameroon highlands, baseline data on anopheline species bionomics were 
collected.
METHODS: Longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted in three localities 
at different altitudinal levels. Mosquitoes were captured when landing on human 
volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. Sampled Anopheles were tested for the 
presence of Plasmodium circumsporozoite proteins and their blood meal origin 
with ELISA. Entomological parameters of malaria epidemiology were assessed using 
Mac Donald's formula.
RESULTS: Anopheline species diversity and density decreased globally from 
lowland to highland. The most aggressive species along the altitudinal transect 
was Anopheles gambiae s.s. of S molecular form, followed in the lowland and on 
the plateau by An. funestus, but uphill by An. hancocki. An. gambiae and An. 
ziemanni exhibited similar seasonal biting patterns at the different levels, 
whereas different features were observed for An. funestus. Only indoor resting 
species could be captured uphill; it is therefore likely that endophilic 
behaviour is necessary for anophelines to climb above a certain threshold. Of 
the ten species collected along the transect, only An. gambiae and An. funestus 
were responsible for malaria transmission, with entomological inoculation rates 
(EIR) of 90.5, 62.8 and zero infective bites/human/year in the lowland, on the 
plateau and uphill respectively. The duration of gonotrophic cycle was 
consistently one day shorter for An. gambiae as compared to An. funestus at 
equal altitude. Altitudinal climate variations had no effect on the survivorship 
and the subsequent life expectancy of the adult stage of these malaria vectors, 
but most probably on aquatic stages. On the contrary increasing altitude 
significantly extended the duration of gonotrophic cycle and reduced: the EIR, 
their preference to human blood and consequently the malaria stability index.
CONCLUSION: Malaria epidemiological rooting in the outskirts of Western Cameroon 
highlands evolves with increasing altitude, gradually from stable to unstable 
settings. This suggests a potential risk of malaria epidemic in highlands, and 
the need for a continuous epidemiological surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The health impacts of pulmonary impairment after tuberculosis (TB) 
treatment have not been included in assessments of TB burden. Therefore, 
previous global and national TB burden estimates do not reflect the full 
consequences of surviving TB. We assessed the burden of TB including pulmonary 
impairment after tuberculosis in Tarrant County, Texas using Disability-adjusted 
Life Years (DALYs).
METHODS: TB burden was calculated for all culture-confirmed TB patients treated 
at Tarrant County Public Health between January 2005 and December 2006 using 
identical methods and life tables as the Global Burden of Disease Study. Years 
of life-lost were calculated as the difference between life expectancy using 
standardized life tables and age-at-death from TB. Years lived-with-disability 
were calculated from age and gender-specific TB disease incidence using 
published disability weights. Non-fatal health impacts of TB were divided into 
years lived-with-disability-acute and years lived-with-disability-chronic. Years 
lived-with-disability-acute was defined as TB burden resulting from illness 
prior to completion of treatment including the burden from treatment-related 
side effects. Years lived-with-disability-chronic was defined as TB burden from 
disability resulting from pulmonary impairment after tuberculosis.
RESULTS: There were 224 TB cases in the time period, of these 177 were culture 
confirmed. These 177 subjects lost a total of 1189 DALYs. Of these 1189 DALYs 
23% were from years of life-lost, 2% were from years lived-with-disability-acute 
and 75% were from years lived-with-disability-chronic.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the disease burden from TB is greater 
than previously estimated. Pulmonary impairment after tuberculosis was 
responsible for the majority of the burden. These data demonstrate that 
successful TB control efforts may reduce the health burden more than previously 
recognized.

OBJECTIVES: To perform surgical closure of a clinically significant arterial 
duct on children in a third world country.
BACKGROUND: An arterial duct is one of the most common congenital cardiac 
defects. Large arterial ducts can cause significant pulmonary overcirculation, 
causing symptoms of congestive cardiac failure, ultimately resulting in 
premature death. Closure of an arterial duct is usually curative, allowing for a 
normal quality of life and expectancy. In western countries, arterial duct 
closure in children is usually performed by deployment of a device through a 
catheter-based approach, replacing previous surgical approaches. In third world 
countries, there is limited access to the necessary resources for performing 
catheter-based closure of an arterial duct. Consequently, children with an 
arterial duct in a third world country may only receive palliative care, can be 
markedly symptomatic, and often do not survive to adulthood.
METHODS: We assembled a team of 11 healthcare workers with extensive experience 
in the medical and surgical management of children with congenital cardiac 
disease. In all, 21 patients with a history of an arterial duct were screened by 
performing a comprehensive history, physical, and echocardiogram at the Angkor 
Hospital for Children in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
RESULTS: A total of 18 children (eight male and ten female), ranging in age from 
10 months to 14 years, were deemed suitable to undergo surgery. All patients 
were symptomatic, and the arterial ducts ranged in size from 4 to 15 
millimetres. Surgical closure was performed using two clips, and in four cases 
with the largest arterial duct, sutures were also placed. All patients had 
successful closure without any significant complications, and were able to be 
discharged home within 2 days of surgery. Of note, four children with arterial 
ducts died in the 5 months before our arrival.
CONCLUSION: Surgical closure of an arterial duct can be performed safely and 
effectively by an experienced paediatric cardiothoracic surgical team on 
children in a third world country. We hope that our experience will inspire 
others to perform similar missions throughout the world.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether (i) motivational enhancement therapy (MET) + 
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) compared with usual care, (ii) MET compared 
with usual care, (iii) or MET + CBT compared with MET was more effective in 
improving glycaemic control when delivered by general nurses with additional 
training in these techniques.
DESIGN: A three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial as the gold standard 
design to test the effectiveness of psychological treatments.
SETTING: The recruiting centres were diabetes clinics in seven acute trusts in 
south-east London and Greater Manchester.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (18-65 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes 
for a minimum duration of 2 years and a current glycated (or glycosylated) 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) value between 8.2% and 15.0%.
INTERVENTIONS: The control arm consisted of usual diabetes care which varied 
between the hospitals, but constituted at least three monthly appointments to 
diabetes clinic. The two treatments arms consisted of usual care with MET and 
usual care with MET + CBT.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was HbA1c at 12 months from 
randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were 1-year costs measured by the 
Client Service Receipt Inventory at baseline, 6 months and 12 months; quality of 
life-years [quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] measured by the SF-36 (Short 
Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire) and EQ-5D (European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions) at baseline and 12 months.
RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and fifty-nine people with type 1 diabetes 
were screened and 344 were randomised to MET + CBT (n = 106), MET (n = 117) and 
to usual care (n = 121). The 12-month follow-up rate for HbA1c was 88% (n = 
305). The adjusted mean 12-month HbA1c was 0.45% lower in those treated with MET 
+ CBT [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16% to 0.79%, p = 0.008] than for usual 
care; 0.16% lower in those treated with MET (95% CI 0.20% to 0.51%, p = 0.38) 
than for usual care; and 0.30% lower with MET + CBT than with MET (95% CI -0.07% 
to 0.66%, p = 0.11). The higher the HbA1c, and the younger the participant at 
baseline, the greater was the reduction in HbA1c. The interventions had no 
effect on secondary outcomes such as depression and quality of life. The 
economic evaluation was inconclusive. Both interventions were associated with 
increased health care costs than for usual care alone. There was no significant 
difference in social costs. Cost effectiveness ratios, up to one year, varied 
considerably according to whether QALY estimates were based on EQ-5D or SF-36 
and whether imputed or complete data were used in the analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of MET and CBT may be useful for patients with 
persistent sub-optimal diabetic control. MET alone appears less effective than 
usual care. Economic evaluation was inconclusive.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a contemporary epidemic that does not affect all age 
groups and sections of society equally.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine socioeconomic differences in 
trajectories of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) and obesity between the ages 
of 45 and 65 y.
DESIGN: A total of 13,297 men and 4532 women from the French GAZEL (Gaz de 
France Electricité de France) cohort study reported their height in 1990 and 
their weight annually over the subsequent 18 y. Changes in BMI and obesity 
between ages 45 and 49 y, 50 and 54 y, 55 and 59 y, and 60 and 65 y as a 
function of education and occupational position (at age 35 y) were modeled by 
using linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: BMI and obesity rates increased between the ages of 45 and 65 y. In 
men, BMI was higher in unskilled workers than in managers at age 45 y; this 
difference in BMI increased from 0.82 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) at 45 y to 1.06 (95% 
CI: 0.85, 1.27) at 65 y. Men with a primary school education compared with those 
with a high school degree at age 45 y had a 0.75 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.00) higher 
BMI, and this difference increased to 1.32 (95% CI: 1.03,1.62) at age 65 y. 
Obesity rates were 3.35% and 7.68% at age 45 y and 9.52% and 18.10% at age 65 y 
in managers and unskilled workers, respectively; the difference in obesity 
increased by 4.25% (95% CI: 1.87, 6.52). A similar trend was observed in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight continues to increase in the transition between midlife and 
old age; this increase is greater in lower socioeconomic groups.

Theta-band phase locking of orbitofrontal neurons during reward expectancy.

The expectancy of a rewarding outcome following actions and cues is coded by a 
network of brain structures including the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus far, 
predicted reward was considered to be coded by time-averaged spike rates of 
neurons. However, besides firing rate, the precise timing of action potentials 
in relation to ongoing oscillations in local field potentials is thought to be 
of importance for effective communication between brain areas. We performed 
multineuron and field potential recordings in orbitofrontal cortex of rats 
performing olfactory discrimination learning to study the temporal structure of 
coding predictive of outcome. After associative learning, field potentials were 
marked by theta oscillations, both in advance and during delivery of reward. 
Orbitofrontal neurons, especially those coding information about upcoming reward 
with their firing rate, phase locked to these oscillations in anticipation of 
reward. When established associations were reversed, phase locking collapsed in 
the anticipatory task phase, but returned when reward became predictable again 
after relearning. Behaviorally, the outcome anticipation phase was marked by 
licking responses, but the frequency of lick responses was dissociated from the 
strength of theta-band phase locking. The strength of theta-band phase locking 
by orbitofrontal neurons robustly follows the dynamics of associative learning 
as measured by behavior and correlates with the rat's current outcome 
expectancy. Theta-band phase locking may facilitate communication of 
outcome-related information between reward-related brain areas and offers a 
novel mechanism for coding value signals during reinforcement learning.

Long-term survival after surgical critical illness: the impact of prolonged 
preceding organ support therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the prognostic importance of preceding invasive 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and catecholamine therapy for long-term 
survivors after surgical critical illness.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Nothing is known about the effect of preceding 
intensive care unit (ICU)-related therapies on long-term outcome.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 
of an ICU patient cohort linked to a local database. Adult patients (n = 1462) 
admitted to a 12-bed ICU between 1993 and 2005, who had an ICU length of stay of 
more than 4 days, were followed up until the end of the second year after ICU 
admission. Hazard function was explored by Weibull modeling and likelihood ratio 
tests. Cox-type structured hazard regression models were used to analyze linear, 
nonlinear, or time-varying associations of therapeutic variables with 2-year 
survival time of a patient subgroup, which had survived the period of high 
hazard.
RESULTS: Hazard rate declined exponentially up to day 195 after ICU admission, 
and became constant thereafter. A total of 808 patients reached this stable 
stage of their disease forming the study population. Of these patients, 648 
(80.2%) were still alive at the end of the second year after ICU admission. 
Underlying diseases were major determinants for long-term outcome. Long-term 
mortality was significantly associated with the acute extent of physiological 
derangement during ICU stay (maximum Apache II score), but was independent from 
the duration of preceding invasive organ support.
CONCLUSION: In surgical patients with a prolonged ICU length of stay, an 
exorbitant mortality exists for about half a year after ICU admission. Later on, 
life expectancy of surviving patients is largely determined by the underlying 
disease and, to a minor degree, by the acute extent of homeostatic disturbance 
during ICU stay. The duration of preceding invasive therapies does not limit 
long-term survival.

OBJECTIVE: To present the longest follow-up report of any lipid-atherosclerosis 
intervention trial.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The Program on the Surgical Control of the 
Hyperlipidemias (POSCH), a secondary, clinical/arteriographic, randomized 
controlled trial, was the first lipid-atherosclerosis trial to demonstrate 
unequivocally that low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction reduced the 
incidence of coronary heart disease death and myocardial infarction.
METHODS: We report POSCH 25 years follow-up for overall mortality, specific 
cause of death, and certain subgroup analyses, as well as a prediction for 
increase in life expectancy derived from the POSCH database, supplemented by the 
2006 National Death Index, 1989-2006.
RESULTS: There were 838 patients randomized in POSCH (421 surgery, 417 control). 
At 25 years follow-up, the difference in the restricted mean survival and the 
logrank (Mantel-Haenszel) statistic was statistically significant, with survival 
probabilities of 0.57 (surgery) and 0.51 (controls). Cause of death data 
indicated a significant increase in cardiovascular deaths in the control group; 
cancer deaths were also greater in the control group but this was not 
significant. The most compelling subgroup analysis was a significant increase in 
survival, starting at 5 years after randomization, in the surgery group for 
patients with an ejection fraction > or = 50%, with relative probabilities of 
0.61 (surgery) and 0.51 (control). The estimated incremental increase in life 
expectancy over more than 25 years of follow-up was 1.0 year overall and 1.7 
years in the cohort with an ejection fraction > or = 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: A 25-year mortality follow-up in POSCH shows statistically 
significant gains in overall survival, cardiovascular disease-free survival, and 
life expectancy in the surgery group compared with the control group.

OBJECTIVE: Cirrhotic patients have poorer life expectancy than the general 
population. The purpose of this study was to identify causes of death in a 
sample of cirrhotic patients from Madagascar.
METHODS: A retrospective analytic and descriptive study was conducted on the 
files of cirrhotic inpatients admitted to the gastroenterology department of the 
Joseph Raseta Befelatanana University Hospital Center in Antananarivo, 
Madagascar from January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2007.
RESULTS: The files of 117 patients were reviewed. Death occurred in 31 cases for 
a mortality rate of 26.5%. The main causes of death were disorders of 
consciousness (51.6%) and hypovolemic shock (25.8%). Jaundice, encephalopathy, 
and gastrointestinal bleeding were predictive factors for mortality.
CONCLUSION: Cirrhotic patients in this study were hospitalized at a late stage 
of disease. Further prospective study in a larger sample will be needed to 
standardize the management protocol in Madagascar.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) leading to neurological deficits produces long-term 
effects that persist over a lifetime. Survival analysis of patients with SCI, at 
individual and population level, is important for public health management and 
the assessment of treatment achievements. The current study evaluated survival 
following traumatic and non-traumatic SCI worldwide. A systematic review was 
conducted, and all included papers were assessed for quality using a purposely 
designed assessment form. Survival data were presented in Kaplan-Meier curves 
and compared using the log-rank test. Sixteen studies were included of which 11 
concerned traumatic SCI, four non-traumatic SCI, and one both. Crude standard 
mortality rates (SMRs) revealed that overall mortality in SCI is up to three 
times higher than in the general population. Survival rates were statistically 
significantly lower in non-traumatic SCI than in traumatic SCI (log-rank p = 
0.000). Age at injury, neurological level, extent of lesion, and year of injury 
have been described as predictors of survival. Causes of death stem from 
secondary complications, with failure of the respiratory system being the 
leading cause. This is the first systematic literature review on survival 
analysis following SCI worldwide. An increase in survival over time was found. 
However, the SMRs of individuals with SCI still exceed those of an age-matched 
non-disabled population, mainly due to secondary complications. Lower survival 
rates were observed in non-traumatic SCI compared with traumatic SCI.

A randomised controlled equivalence trial to determine the effectiveness and 
cost-utility of manual chest physiotherapy techniques in the management of 
exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MATREX).

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect, if any, of manual chest physiotherapy (MCP) 
administered to patients hospitalised with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) exacerbation on both disease-specific and generic health-related quality 
of life. To compare the health service costs for those receiving and not 
receiving MCP.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial powered for equivalence. It was 
not possible to blind participants, clinicians or research staff to study arm 
allocation during the intervention.
SETTING: Four UK hospitals in Norwich, Great Yarmouth, King's Lynn and 
Liverpool.
PARTICIPANTS: 526 participants aged 34-91 years were recruited between November 
2005 and April 2008; of these, 372 provided evaluable data for the primary 
outcome. All persons hospitalised with COPD exacerbation and evidence of sputum 
production on examination were eligible for the trial providing there were no 
contraindications to performing MCP.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated to either MCP or no MCP on an 
intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. However, active cycle of breathing techniques 
(ACBT) was used in both arms. Participants allocated to the intervention were 
guided to perform ACBT while the physiotherapist delivered MCP. Participants 
allocated to the control arm received instruction on ACBT only.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was COPD-specific quality of life, 
measured using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at 6 months post 
randomisation. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire 
was used to calculate the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain associated with 
MCP compared with no MCP. Secondary physiological outcome measures were also 
used.
RESULTS: Of the 526 participants, 261 were allocated to MCP and 264 to control, 
with 186 participants evaluable in each arm. ITT analyses indicated no 
significant difference at 6 months post randomisation in total SGRQ score 
[adjusted effect size (no MCP - MCP) 0.03 (95% confidence interval, CI -0.14 to 
0.19)], SGRQ symptom score [adjusted effect size 0.04 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.23)], 
SGRQ activity score [adjusted effect size -0.02 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.16)] or SGRQ 
impact score [adjusted effect size 0.02 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.18)]. The imputed ITT 
and per-protocol results were similar. No significant differences were observed 
in any of the outcome measures or subgroup analyses. Compared with no MCP, 
employing MCP was associated with a slight loss in quality of life (0.001 QALY 
loss) but lower health service costs (cost saving of 410.79 pounds). Based on 
these estimates, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of lambda = 20,000 pounds per 
QALY, MCP would constitute a cost-effective use of resources (net benefit = 
376.14 pounds). There was, however, a high level of uncertainty associated with 
these results and it is possible that the lower health service costs could have 
been due to other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In terms of longer-term quality of life the use of MCP did not 
appear to affect outcome. However, this does not mean that MCP is of no 
therapeutic value to patients with COPD in specific circumstances. Although the 
cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that its use was cost-effective, much 
uncertainty was associated with this finding and it would be difficult to 
justify providing MCP therapy on the basis of cost-effectiveness alone. Future 
research should include evaluation of MCP for patients with COPD producing high 
volumes of sputum, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of ACBT in COPD 
exacerbation.

Comment in
    Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2010 Jul;3(4):335-6.

BACKGROUND: Although bivalirudin compared with unfractionated heparin with 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduces bleeding and hospitalization costs in 
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), little is known 
about the economic impact of bivalirudin versus heparin alone and at what 
threshold of procedural bleeding risk bivalirudin would be considered 
cost-effective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A validated model was used to predict risk of major 
bleeding for 81,628 National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI 
Registry patients from 2004 to 2006 who received unfractionated heparin only. 
Costs were derived from multiple sources including wholesale acquisition costs 
(for drugs) and single-center data (for PCI-related complications). Based on 
ISAR-REACT 3, we assumed that bivalirudin would reduce the risk of major 
bleeding by 33% compared with unfractionated heparin alone. A Markov model was 
used to estimate lost life expectancy associated with a major bleed. Major 
bleeding was predicted to occur in 2.2% of patients. Bivalirudin for all 
patients was estimated to increase costs by $571 per patient, yielding 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $287,473 per bleeding event averted and $1,173,360 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Bivalirudin was cost saving for patients 
with a predicted bleeding risk >20% (0.16% of CathPCI population). At 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50K and $100K per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained, bivalirudin was cost-effective for patients with a bleeding risk > or = 
8% (2.5% patients) and > or = 5% (7.9% patients), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This decision-analytic modeling study demonstrates that for 
patients undergoing PCI, substitution of bivalirudin for unfractionated heparin 
monotherapy is projected to increase costs for virtually all patients and would 
be considered cost-effective for only a minority of patients with a high 
bleeding risk. From a policy standpoint, studies such as this, aimed at 
identifying the appropriate risk threshold for initiating treatment, may help in 
the development of informed guidelines for the use of expensive therapies.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis for single-level instrumented fusion 
during a 5-year postoperative interval.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for 
single-level instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar 
spine conditions during a 5-year period.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cost/QALY has become a standard measure among 
healthcare economists because it is generic and can be used across medical 
treatments. Prior studies have reported widely variable estimates of cost/QALY 
for lumbar spine fusion. This variability may be related to factors including 
study design, sample population, baseline assumptions, and length of the 
observation period.
METHODS: To determine QALY, the Short Form 6D (SF-6D), a utility index derived 
from the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) was used. Cost analysis was 
performed based on actual reimbursements from third-party payors, including 
those for the index surgical procedure, treatment of complications, emergency 
room outpatient visits, and revision surgery. A second cost analysis using only 
the contemporaneous Medicare Fee schedule was also performed, in addition to a 
subanalysis including indirect costs from days off work.
RESULTS: The mean SF-6D health utility value showed a gradual increase 
throughout the follow-up period. The mean health utility value gained in each 
year postoperatively was 0.12, 0.14, 0.13, 0.15, and 0.15, for a cumulative 0.69 
QALY improvement during the 5-year interval. Mean direct medical costs based on 
actual reimbursements for 5 years after surgery, including the index and 
revision procedures, was $22,708. The resultant cost per QALY gained at the 
5-year postoperative interval was $33,018. The analogous mean direct cost based 
on Medicare reimbursement for 5 years was $20,669, with a resultant cost per 
QALY gained of $30,053. The mean total work productivity cost for 5 years was 
$14,377. The resultant total cost (direct and indirect) per QALY gained ranged 
from $53,949 to $53,914 at 5 years postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: In the future, surgeons will need to demonstrate cost-effectiveness 
as well as clinical efficacy in order to justify payment for medical and 
surgical interventions, including lumbar spine fusion. This study indicates that 
at 5-year follow-up, single-level instrumented posterolateral spine fusion is 
both effective and durable, resulting in a favorable cost/QALY gain compared to 
other widely accepted healthcare interventions.

Skill set development of doctoral and post-doctoral graduates in life sciences.

Kanwar RS(1).

Ames, Iowa 50011, USA.

Doctoral and post-doctoral training programs at leading research universities in 
the USA are highly important in generating the much needed knowledge in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics for keeping rural and urban economies 
strong and societies healthy and prosperous. In addition, innovative graduate 
and post doctoral research programs are the driving engines of the success of 
U.S. economy and have made the U.S. the most successful model of generating new 
knowledge in the broader areas of life sciences (and agricultural education, 
research, and extension). We need to do everything in our power to make these 
training programs innovative, collaborative, independent, and resourceful so 
that students are trained in different disciplines making them more flexible 
within a range of challenges and opportunities. The training programs must 
empower students to solve complex and interdisciplinary problems of the society 
in 21st century and make our students competitive within a global economic 
system, to improve the health of the nation's economy. If our land grant schools 
and institutions of higher learning are not preparing doctoral students to be 
globally competitive scientists to create new knowledge and technologies to 
solve complex and interdisciplinary problems of the 21st century, then either we 
need to redefine the mission of our land grant system or we risk losing our role 
to serve the public and industry effectively. Doctoral and post doctoral 
students should be given the needed skills and experiences to prepare them for 
tenure track faculty jobs at leading US Universities in the 21st century as well 
as prepare them for the world outside of academia. I would say minimum 
competency skills are needed as "bare survival skills" for all doctoral students 
to become successful after obtaining PhD degrees. Today's PhD students will be 
working in a global but highly competitive, rapidly changing, and complex world. 
It is no longer enough to be a good researcher and a good teacher; researchers 
and teachers must be good team players and leaders to lead interdisciplinary 
research programs, and exceptional managers to effectively manage their research 
staff, MS and PhD students, and post doctoral researchers. Doctoral students 
have exceptional opportunities during their PhD degree programs to acquire these 
skills from their world class supervisors and participate in available workshops 
on how to develop successful and winning grant proposals, improving 
communication skills, and participate in "future faculty programs" on their 
campuses.

Standardization of doctoral study in agricultural and extension education: is 
the field of study mature enough for achievement of the optimum degree of order?

Agricultural and extension education--or some derivative name--is a field of 
study leading to the doctoral degree in universities around the world. Is there 
are body of knowledge or a taxonomy of the knowledge--e.g., a knowledge 
domain--that one should possess with a doctorate in agricultural and extension 
education? The purpose of this paper was to synthesize the work of researchers 
who attempted to define the field of study, with a taxonomy comprising the 
knowledge domains (standards) and knowledge objects--structured interrelated 
sets of data, knowledge, and wisdom--of the field of study. Doctoral study in 
agricultural and extension education needs a document that provides for rules 
and guidelines--rules and guidelines that in turn provide for common and 
repeated use--all leading to achievement of an optimum degree of order in the 
context of academic, scholarly, and professional practice in agricultural and 
extension education. Thus, one would know in broad categories the knowledge, 
skills, and abilities possessed by one who holds a doctoral degree in 
agricultural and extension education. That is, there would exist a standard for 
doctoral degrees in agricultural and extension education. A content analysis of 
three previous attempts to categorize knowledge in agricultural and extension 
education served as the primary technique to create a new taxonomy--or to 
confirm an existing taxonomy--for doctoral study in agricultural and extension 
education. The following coalesced as nine essential knowledge domains for a 
doctorate in agricultural and extension education: (1) history, philosophy, 
ethics, and policy; (2) agricultural/rural development; (3) organizational 
development and change management; (4) planning, needs assessment, and 
evaluation; (5) learning theory; (6) curriculum development and instructional 
design; (7) teaching methods and delivery strategies; (8) research methods and 
tools; and, (9) scholarship and communications.

Comparable data on cancer incidence and mortality in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, 
Norway, and Sweden are available for analysis through a collaboration of the 
national Cancer Registries via the NORDCAN website (http://ancr.nu). In the 
continued spirit of Nordic collaborative research, a number of studies examining 
trends in cancer survival are published in this journal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were divided into eight 5-year periods by sex in 
five Nordic countries. Age-standardised 5-year relative survival ratios and 
excess mortality rates in the short-term (first month and 1-3 months following 
diagnosis), and the long-term (2-5 years after diagnosis) were calculated, as 
were age-specific 5-year relative survival using cohort-survival methods. A 
hybrid method combining the cohort and period methods was used for the period 
1999-2003 as not all patients were followed for five years. Age-standardisation 
used the International Cancer Survival Standard, and calculation of expected 
deaths used country-specific population mortality rates.
RESULTS: The data series constitutes 3 360 397 tumours among 3 160 802 patients 
followed up for death through 2006 for 39 different cancer sites diagnosed in 
the years 1964-2003. The paper describes the data, exclusions and imputations, 
design and analysis, age structure and standardisation procedures, follow-up, 
and case-mix adjustment methods.
CONCLUSION: The strengths of this study include the overall comparability and 
quality of the data, the national coverage, and the length of the time series. 
Collecting and analysing data from the five Nordic countries for 39 different 
cancer sites over 40 years in a systematised and comparable way is a major 
undertaking. A thorough description of the analyses, definitions and exclusions 
in the survival study, supplemented with corresponding information on cancer 
incidence and mortality is needed for appropriate interpretation and comparison 
between countries, and between and within cancer sites. This information must be 
made available to provide appropriate interpretation of the site-specific 
results.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that often presents in early 
adulthood.
AIM: To evaluate health care costs and costs per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) for Crohn's disease.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using administrative claims data for 
patients aged > or = 18 years with > or = 3 years of continuous enrolment from 
2000 to 2008 and > or =2 Crohn's disease claims. Disease states (remission, 
mild-moderate, moderate-severe, and severe-fulminant) were defined using the 
American College of Gastroenterology treatment guidelines criteria. Transition 
probabilities were calculated from consecutive 6-month periods. Costs were 
determined from paid claims and QALY utilities were obtained from the 
literature. The model assumed a 30-year-old patient at the time of entry into 
the model.
RESULTS: There were 40 063 patients identified, with a total of 420 773 cycles 
[remission (197 111; 46.8%), mild-moderate (44 024; 10.5%), moderate-severe (132 
695; 31.5%), severe-fulminant (46 925; 11.2%)]. The costs/QALY for remission, 
mild-moderate, moderate-severe, and severe-fulminant disease states respectively 
were $2896, $8428, $11 518 and $69 277 for males and $2896, $8426, $22 633 and 
$69 412 for females.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, health care costs for patients with Crohn's disease 
increased with disease severity. Although the probabilities of transitioning 
from other health states to the severe-fulminant disease state were low, the 
cost/QALY was high.

BACKGROUND: Recently, the present team reported the 1-year data of a one-stage 
surgery and mainly early loading with five supporting implants in completely 
edentulous mandibles, indicating more bone loss at the central implant, placed 
in the midline of the jaw.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present retrospective investigation was to evaluate the 
1-year results of the same treatment technique with four instead of five 
supporting implants in completely edentulous mandibles. The outcome was compared 
with that of a former study (control) on five implants per patient during first 
year of function.
