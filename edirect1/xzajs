Extremely preterm infants [gestational age (GA) between 24-28 weeks] should be 
delivered optimally in an institute where neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is 
available and their short- and long-term care is ensured. At the Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7499 infants were 
born between 1st of January, 2000 and 31st of December, 2004. During this period 
the rate of preterm deliveries was 20% (1499/7499). Among preterm infants the 
incidence of extremely preterm babies (GA 28 weeks or less) was 18% (272/1499), 
the rate of profoundly preterm infants (GA less than 25 weeks) was 3.2% 
(48/1499). Advancing with gestational age the survival rate is increasing. At 
the department, the rate of handicapped infants among extremely premature babies 
was 15.3%. The majority of the handicapped infants were profoundly preterm, 
meanwhile, more than 50% of infants born at the 26 gestational weeks were free 
of symptoms influencing social activities. It is important to stress the 
prognostic value of the screening for hearing loss (otoacoustic emission), 
visual problems, and intracranial bleeding for the early detection and cure of 
the possible complications of prematurity.

BACKGROUND: Evidence is accumulating to suggest that clinical guidelines should 
be modified for patients with comorbidities, yet there is no quantitative and 
objective approach that considers benefits together with risks.
METHODS: We outline a framework using a payoff time, which we define as the 
minimum elapsed time until the cumulative incremental benefits of a guideline 
exceed its cumulative incremental harms. If the payoff time of a guideline 
exceeds a patient's comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy, then the guideline is 
unlikely to offer a benefit and should be modified. We illustrate the framework 
by applying this method to colorectal cancer screening guidelines for 
50-year-old men with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 60-year-old women 
with congestive heart failure (CHF).
RESULTS: We estimated that colorectal cancer screening payoff times for 
50-year-old men with HIV would range from 1.9 to 5.0 years and that colorectal 
cancer screening payoff times for 60-year-old women with CHF would range from 
0.7 to 2.9 years. Because the payoff times for 50-year-old men with HIV were 
lower than their life expectancies (12.5-24.0 years), colorectal cancer 
screening may be beneficial for these patients. In contrast, because payoff 
times for 60-year-old women with CHF were sometimes greater than their life 
expectancies (0.6 to >5 years), colorectal cancer screening is likely to be 
harmful for some of these patients.
CONCLUSION: Use of a payoff time calculation may be a feasible framework to 
tailor clinical guidelines to the comorbidity profiles of individual patients.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a known predictor of mortality, but most studies include 
small numbers of participants above age 90. The influence of dementia or 
cognition on mortality in this age group is therefore uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine 5-year mortality in relation to dementia and cognitive 
performance at age 95.
METHODS: A population sample of 338 individuals examined at age 95 was followed 
to age 100. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria. Cognitive 
function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). 
Information on severe physical disorders was obtained from the Swedish Hospital 
Discharge Register, and date of death from the Swedish Population Register.
RESULTS: Five-year mortality was higher in 95-year-olds with dementia than in 
95-year-olds without dementia (96% vs 73%; p < 0.0001), even when adjusting for 
severe physical disorders. A Cox regression analysis with calculation of 
population attributable risk (PAR), calculated from adjusted relative risks, 
showed that mortality was predicted by dementia (PAR 42%), cardiac disease (PAR 
17%), cancer (PAR 6%), and male sex (PAR 7%), but not by stroke. Among the 
subjects without dementia, cognitive performance measured using the MMSE (n = 
133 with complete tests; 81% of the subjects without dementia) predicted 
mortality. For each point increase in the MMSE, mortality decreased by 13%.
CONCLUSIONS: In 95-year-olds, dementia, as well as cognitive performance in the 
subjects without dementia, influences mortality. When controlling for other 
severe medical conditions we found dementia to be the leading cause of deaths 
among the oldest old. The reason why dementia and cognitive function predict 
life expectancy requires further elucidation.

The economic impacts of premature adult mortality: panel data evidence from 
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

Measuring the household level economic impacts of AIDS-related deaths is of 
particular salience in South Africa, a country struggling with a legacy of 
poverty and economic inequality in the midst of an HIV epidemic. Household panel 
data that span more than a decade permit us to resolve many of the statistical 
problems that make it difficult to determine these impacts. After allowing for 
the impact of demographic adjustments and other coping strategies, we found 
evidence that these impacts are quite different across different types of 
households, and that the largest and most persistent effects were in the middle 
ranges of the South African income distribution, that is, households just above 
the poverty line. Households below that level seem less severely affected, 
whereas those above it seem to recover more quickly. All these results need to 
be treated with caution because their statistical precision is weak.

BACKGROUND: The project to develop a new Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) 
score rating system for low back disorders, the JOA Back Pain Evaluation 
Questionnaire (JOABPEQ), is currently in progress. Part 1 of the study selected 
25 "candidate" items for use on the JOABPEQ. The purpose of this current Part 2 
of the study was to verify the reliability of the questionnaire.
METHODS: A total of 161 patients with low-back disorders of any type 
participated in the study. Each patient was interviewed twice at an interval of 
2 weeks using the same questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was 
evaluated by determining the extension of the kappa and weighted kappa 
coefficients.
RESULTS: Both kappa and weighted kappa were more than 0.50 for all but one item, 
which was 0.48. The lower 95% confidence interval exceeded 0.4 in all but two 
items, which was 0.39. This implied that the test-retest reliability of JOABPEQ 
was acceptable as a measure of outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The tentative questionnaire of the JOABPEQ with 25 items was 
confirmed to be reliable enough to describe the quality of life of patients who 
suffer low back disorders.

Impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus are becoming increasingly 
common complications of cystic fibrosis (CF), most probably merely as a result 
of increased life expectancy. In order to understand the pathophysiology of 
cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), knowledge on the possible expression 
and cell distribution of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) protein within the endocrine pancreas is required. In this report, we 
establish the first evidence for expression of CFTR protein in rat pancreatic 
islets by using independent techniques. First reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification showed that CFTR mRNA is present in 
isolated islets of Langerhans. Furthermore, the analysis of flow 
cytometry-separated islet cells indicated that the level of CFTR transcripts is 
significantly higher in the non-beta than in beta-cell populations. The 
expression of CFTR protein in rat islet cells was also demonstrated by Western 
blotting and the level of expression was also found significantly higher in the 
non-beta than in beta-cell populations. Last, in situ immunocytochemistry 
studies with two monoclonal antibodies recognizing different CFTR epitopes 
indicated that CFTR expression occurs mainly in glucagon-secreting alpha-cells.

[Age- and sex-specific mortality in the Ruhr region from 1994 to 2004].

[Article in German]

Gesundheitswissenschaften, Universität Bielefeld.

OBJECTIVE: Results of an analysis of the mortality in the Ruhr region have shown 
increased mortality rates and a corresponding lower life expectancy, relative to 
the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) as a whole. For the years 
2002-2004 the male life expectancy was 0.86 years below the NRW level, and for 
females 0.56 years under the NRW level. The analysis of the age- and 
sex-specific mortality rates be-tween the years 1994 and 2004 has demonstrated 
in which age groups mortality increased in the Ruhr region.
METHOD: The mortality rates for all 15 municipalities and counties of the Ruhr 
region have been analysed according to different areas: centre of population 
(Ballungskern), conurbation areas (Ballungsrandzone), Ruhr City (alias 
Ruhrgebiet/Ruhr-Region) and NRW without Ruhr City. Eleven average values and 
three-year mean values were calculated to reduce the range of the year-values. 
Per cent deviations of the NRW values demonstrate the size of the differences.
RESULTS: Comparisons between the centres of population, conurbation areas with 
NRW without Ruhr City demonstrate an increased mortality especially in the male 
and female age groups of 40 to 54 years. A comparison of the municipalities with 
the highest life expectancy level, Bonn, with that with the lowest life 
expectancy level, Gelsenkirchen, for the years 2002-2004 shows a difference in 
the life expectancy of 2.7 years for females and 4.3 years for males. The male 
and female mortality rates of the age groups 40-59 years in Gelsenkirchen exceed 
the comparable rates in Bonn by 30% on average.
CONCLUSION: In spite of increasing life expectancy in the Ruhr region from 1994 
to 2004 the age-specific mortality rates of the 35-54-year-old population are 
increased, especially in the centres of population. The problem area is the 
centres of population with a complicated socio-demographic situation and worse 
indicators of the health status.

[Age and cause of death contributing to reduction of disparity in age-adjusted 
overall mortality between males in Okinawa and mainland Japan].

[Article in Japanese]

OBJECTIVES: We here propose a new index, the difference-change contribution 
proportion, to quantify contributions of age and cause of death to differences 
in age-adjusted overall mortality disparities between two groups over time. The 
present study was conducted with the aim of elucidating age and cause of death 
contributions to the recent decrease in disparity in life expectancy between 
males in Okinawa and mainland Japan. The longer-term goal is to apply the 
findings to developing appropriate preventive measures against diseases for 
Okinawa people.
METHODS: Changes in disparity between age-adjusted overall mortality of male 
populations of Okinawa and Japan nationwide during a 15-year period, between 
1985 and 2000, were measured and difference-change contribution proportions for 
age-adjusted overall mortality were computed.
RESULTS: Causes of death that showed high difference-change contribution 
proportions included cerebral infarction (24.26%), cardiac failure (18.45%), 
other cerebrovascular diseases (15.11%), malignant gastric neoplasms (11.89%), 
ischemic heart disease (11.06%), hepatic disease (10.93%), suicide (5.71%), and 
diabetes (5.36%). Of these, cerebral infarction, cardiac failure, other 
cerebrovascular diseases, malignant gastric neoplasm, ischemic heart disease, 
and diabetes indicated high difference-change contribution proportions among 
seniors 65 years old and above, while hepatic disease and suicide ranked highly 
among the middle-aged.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed the extent of age and cause of 
death contributions to the decreasing disparity observed between populations of 
Okinawa and Japan nationwide in male age-adjusted overall mortality. The causes 
of death and the age revealed by this study are critical to taking preventive 
measures against diseases. Moreover, this study confirmed that the 
difference-change contribution proportion is a useful method to quantify 
contributions of age and cause of death to changes in variation regarding life 
expectancy.

Effective discharge planning is needed to facilitate clients' transition from 
psychiatric hospital wards to community care. Previous studies have shown that 
client outcomes can be improved by using a Transitional Discharge Model (TDM) 
that includes peer support and an extension of inpatient-practitioner 
relationships that are introduced prior to discharge. However, countries vary in 
many ways that may affect implementation of the model. This article describes 
some of the similarities and differences related to introducing transitional 
discharge in two countries: Canada and Scotland. It is important to elucidate 
facilitators and challenges in implementing the TDM to identify and disseminate 
strategies to aid implementation. Implications for future implementation of the 
model are also discussed.

University, Bangkok, Thailand. pramook_siriraj@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: The concomitant cardiopulmonary disease precluded the elective 
repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with acceptable risk. The 
endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become an alternative 
method for the treatment of AAA with high-risk comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the results of EVAR in high-risk patients with large AAA.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study of high-risk patients with large AAA 
and suitable morphology who underwent EVAR between August 2003 and August 2005 
was conducted. The long-term outcomes were observed up to December 2006. The 
comorbidities, size of aneurysm, types of procedures, operative time, amount of 
blood loss and transfusion, length of postoperative stay in intensive care unit 
and hospital, postoperative complications and mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight patients (7 males and 1 female) with the mean age of 71.4 years 
(range 66-83 years) were included in the present study. The comorbidities were 
six of compromised cardiac status, one of severe pulmonary disease and one of 
morbid obesity. The average size of aneurysm was 6.2 +/- 0.64 centimetres. One 
patient also had large bilateral iliac artery aneurysms. Seven patients 
underwent EVAR with bifurcated aortic stent graft and one proceeded with aorto 
uni-iliac stent graft. Three patients underwent preoperative coil embolisation 
into internal iliac arteries when the distal landing zones at the external iliac 
arteries were considered. The mean estimated blood loss was 369cc and the mean 
blood transfusion was 0.88 units. There were no perioperative mortality, early 
graft occlusion, AAA rupture and open conversion in the present study. One 
patient had cardiac arrest due to upper airway obstruction but with successful 
treatment. Type II endoleak was observed in one patient and successfully treated 
by expectant management. One limb of bifurcated stent graft was occluded at the 
5th month post EVAR and was successfully treated by artery bypass surgery at 
both groins. The 3-year primary graft limb patency was 87.5% (7/8). The 
survivals of patients at 1, 2 and 3 years were 100%, 100% and 87.5% 
respectively. The cause of death in one patient was not related to EVAR.
CONCLUSION: EVAR may be a safe and effective alternative to open AAA repair 
especially in high-risk patients.

Laparoscopic nephrectomy outcomes of elderly patients in the 21st century.

Lai FC(1), Kau EL, Ng CS, Fuchs GJ.

(1)Minimally Invasive Urology Institute, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los 
Angeles, California 90048, USA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As life expectancy continues to increase, we will be 
faced with the need to counsel older patients on the risks and benefits of 
undergoing surgery. It is clear that laparoscopic renal surgery has significant 
benefits over open renal surgery. However, contemporary data on whether these 
benefits carry over to the elderly is less robust. The objective of this study 
is to compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients 
age 70 and over to those under age 70. Outcomes from the study can be used to 
assist in preoperative counseling for older patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2000 and December 2005, 405 consecutive 
patients underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign or malignant conditions. 
To decrease selection bias, kidney donors, bilateral nephrectomies, partial 
nephrectomies, as well as patients under the age of 17 were excluded. 
Laparoscopic nephrectomies included simple nephrectomies, radical nephrectomies, 
and nephroureterectomies. A total of 158 patients were included in the analysis. 
Patient demographics and perioperative data were recorded prospectively. The 
preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was used to 
reflect patient co-morbidity. Subset analysis between pure laparoscopic 
nephrectomy (LN) and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) was also 
performed.
RESULTS: Average hospital stay for patients 70 years and older was 3.6 days 
versus 2.6 days for their younger counterparts (p = 0.02). All other demographic 
and perioperative parameters were comparable between groups, including incidence 
of intraoperative or postoperative complications, blood transfusions, and 
conversions to open surgery. In a subset analysis of patients undergoing HALN, 
despite having similar co-morbid conditions (ASA score 2.57 vs. 2.56, p = 0.9), 
the elderly group had a significantly increased length of stay compared to 
patients younger than 70 years (3.0 vs. 4.2 days, p < 0.05). However, in the 
group undergoing LN, there was no statistically significant difference in 
hospital stay (3.1 vs. 2.4 days, p = 0.22), despite the older group having 
higher co-morbid conditions (ASA score 2.55 vs. 2.10, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Other than an increased hospital stay by one day, patients 70 years 
and older undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy can expect comparable 
perioperative outcomes to those achieved in younger patients. Such differences 
in the length of hospital stay may be mitigated by pure laparoscopic nephrectomy 
as opposed to hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients 70 years or 
older. These data may be useful in preoperative decision-making and counseling 
in this growing subset of patients.

The optimal timing of intestinal transplantation for children with intestinal 
failure: a Markov analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Identify an optimal approach to the timing of intestinal 
transplantation for children dependent on total parenteral nutrition (PN).
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Children with short bowel syndrome are frequently 
dependent on PN for growth and development. Intestinal transplantation is often 
considered after PN-related complications occur, but optimal timing of 
transplantation is controversial.
METHODS: A Markov analytic model was used to determine life expectancy (LY) and 
quality-adjusted life years on a theoretical cohort of 4-year-old subjects for 
two treatment strategies: (1) standard care consisting of PN and referral to 
transplantation according to accepted guidelines and (2) early listing for 
isolated small intestine transplantation.
RESULTS: Early listing for intestinal transplantation was associated with 0.27 
additional life years (13.16 vs. 12.89) and 0.76 additional quality-adjusted 
life years (10.51 vs. 9.75) as compared with current standard care. The 
unadjusted analysis was sensitive to the development of PN-associated liver 
disease, at a threshold of approximately 11% per year, and its related 
probability of dying at a threshold of 80% 2-year mortality. Early listing for 
transplantation was the dominant strategy until the probability of late bowel 
rejection reached 35% per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with short bowel syndrome dependent on PN should be 
considered for intestinal transplantation earlier than what is current practice.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis or acute neutropenia.

de l'Hôpital, 67 091 Strasbourg Cedex, France.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis or acute 
neutropenia is an adverse event resulting in a neutrophil count of under 0.5 x 
10/l. Patients with such severe neutropenia are likely to experience 
life-threatening and sometimes fatal infections.
RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last 20 years, the incidence of idiosyncratic 
drug-induced agranulocytosis or acute neutropenia has remained stable at 
2.4-15.4 cases per million, despite the emergence of new causative drugs: 
antibiotics (beta-lactam and cotrimoxazole), antiplatelet agents (ticlopidine), 
antithyroid drugs, sulfasalazine, neuroleptics (clozapine), antiepileptic agents 
(carbamazepine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and dipyrone. 
Drug-induced agranulocytosis remains a serious adverse event due to the 
occurrence of severe sepsis with severe deep infections (such as pneumonia), 
septicemia and septic shock in around two thirds of patients. In this setting, 
old age (>65 years), septicemia or shock, metabolic disorders such as renal 
failure, and a neutrophil count under 0.1 x 10/l are poor prognostic factors. 
Nevertheless with appropriate management using preestablished procedures, with 
intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and hematopoietic growth factors, 
the mortality rate is currently around 5%.
SUMMARY: Given the increased life expectancy and subsequent longer exposure to 
drugs, as well as the development of new agents, healthcare professionals should 
be aware of this adverse event and its management.

BACKGROUND: To examine lifetime patterns of cardiovascular risk factors and 
their implications in subsequent birth cohorts of older adults in Germany, who 
experienced very different political and socioeconomic conditions at various 
phases of their lives.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants of the ESTHER study, a statewide cohort study 
conducted in Saarland, Germany, were categorized into four birth cohorts: 
1925-1934, 1935-1939, 1940-1944, 1945-1952. At baseline, lifetime history of 
body weight, physical activity, smoking and drinking habits, and of 
physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus were documented. The average BMI, the 
average number of hours of physical activity, prevalence of smoking and alcohol 
consumption between ages 20 and 50 years were assessed. The relative risks of a 
first diagnosis of diabetes mellitus before or at the age of 50 years by birth 
cohorts were assessed by multiple logistic regressions controlling for education 
and BMI at the age of 20.
RESULTS: For both men and women, later birth cohorts had considerably worse 
lifestyle profiles. The frequency of diabetes mellitus up to the age of 50 years 
was much higher in the later than in the earlier cohorts. The increase was more 
pronounced among men than among women.
CONCLUSION: Women and men reaching old age in the forthcoming years have more 
unfavourable lifetime risk factor profiles than earlier birth cohorts. These 
patterns might have substantial implications for the future burden of chronic 
disease.

Quality of life (QL) is an important consideration when comparing adjuvant 
therapies for early breast cancer, especially if they differ substantially in 
toxicity. We evaluated QL and Q-TWiST among patients randomised to adjuvant 
dose-intensive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide administered with filgrastim and 
progenitor cell support (DI-EC) or standard-dose anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy (SD-CT). We estimated the duration of chemotherapy toxicity (TOX), 
time without disease symptoms and toxicity (TWiST), and time following relapse 
(REL). Patients scored QL indicators. Mean durations for the three transition 
times were weighted with patient reported utilities to obtain mean Q-TWiST. 
Patients receiving DI-EC reported worse QL during TOX, especially treatment 
burden (month 3: P<0.01), but a faster recovery 3 months following chemotherapy 
than patients receiving SD-CT, for example, less coping effort (P<0.01). Average 
Q-TWiST was 1.8 months longer for patients receiving DI-EC (95% CI, -2.5 to 
6.1). Q-TWiST favoured DI-EC for most values of utilities attached to TOX and 
REL. Despite greater initial toxicity, quality-adjusted survival was similar or 
better with dose-intensive treatment as compared to standard treatment. Thus, QL 
considerations should not be prohibitive if future intensive therapies show 
superior efficacy.

Is it necessary to cure prostate cancer when it is possible? (Understanding the 
role of prostate inflammation resolution to prostate cancer evolution).

OBJECTIVE: Definitive therapy with radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, or 
radiation therapy generally follows the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, 
particularly when men have at least 10 additional years of life expectancy. 
There is growing concern regarding the optimal conservative treatment for 
patients who decline or do not otherwise qualify for such definitive curative 
treatment. For those patients who choose a watchful waiting approach, it would 
be beneficial to know what specific dietary and nutritional methods could 
potentially slow the progression of their disease. In this prospective study, it 
was our goal to analyze the efficacy and safety of treating prostate cancer 
conservatively using the principles of a Mediterranean diet in association with 
a specific prostate nutritional supplement.
METHOD: Twenty-three men aged 43-74 (median age: 64) with biopsy proven, 
organ-confined prostate cancer who had already declined immediate hormonal 
therapy and attempts at a curative cancer treatment agreed to participate in a 
Chronic Disease Management (CDM) protocol highlighted by diet with a specific 
prostate nutritional supplement. The diet recommended was a modified 
Mediterranean diet while a patented nutritional prostatitis formula (Peenuts) 
was the supplement common to all patients. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), a 
recognized marker of prostate disease and prostate cancer activity, was the 
primary indicator to validate exacerbation or suppression of disease. All men 
were followed with serial PSA testing, a digital rectal exam, an International 
Prostate Symptom Score index (IPSS-Index) and an expressed prostatic secretion 
(EPS) examination. The primary Gleason sum/score represented in this study was 6 
(n = 11), while Gleason sum patterns 5, 5/6, 6/7, and 7 were also evaluated. 
Referencing the Partin Tables, organ confinement was predicted to be 66%.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of men (n = 20) noted a 58% reduction (range of 
improvement: 13%-90%) in PSA over an average of 38.5 months (range: 13-84 
months). The remaining 13% of men included three men who experienced a mild 
elevation in PSA of 0.3 ng/ml, 0.7 ng/ml, and 0.9 ng/ml over 14 months, 42 
months, and 34 months, respectively. Fifteen men had completed an initial and 
secondary IPSS-Index while 14 men had undergone an initial and secondary EPS. 
The mean percentage reduction in IPSS-Index was 61% (range: 20%-100% with a 
median of 55%), while men evaluated with EPS examinations noted a mean 
percentage reduction in white blood cells of 77.5% (range: 33%-99% with a median 
of 82%). These results were evaluated using the t-test, Wilcoxon Analysis and 
the Null Hypothesis and found to be statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Clearly there is a need to develop effective alternative 
conservative therapies for the increasing numbers of prostate cancer patients 
who will not tolerate definitive curative measures or simply choose a 
conservative approach. Although this prospective study had no control arm, was 
of limited duration and included only 23 participants, it did appear to show 
significant benefit to the majority of prostate cancer patients treated with 
selective nutritional and dietary therapy alone. Such treatments may provide a 
safe and effective long-term treatment alternative for some patients. Further 
study is encouraged.

Respiratory disorders during sleep in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Ricerche, Palermo, Italy. marrone@ibim.cnr.it

Patients with COPD may show slow, progressive deteriorations in arterial blood 
gases during the night, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This 
is mainly due to hypoventilation, while a deterioration of ventilation/perfusion 
mismatch plays a minor role. The severity of gas exchanges alterations is 
proportional to the degree of impairment of diurnal pulmonary function tests, 
particularly of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 
in arterial blood, but correlations between diurnal and nocturnal blood gas 
levels are rather loose. Subjects with diurnal PaO2 of 60-70 mmHg are 
distinguished in "desaturators" and "nondesaturators" according to nocturnal 
oxyhemoglobin saturation behavior. The role of nocturnal hypoxemia as a 
determinant of alterations in sleep structure observed in COPD is dubious. 
Effects of the "desaturator" condition on pulmonary hemodynamics, evolution of 
diurnal blood gases, and life expectancy are also controversial. Conversely, it 
is generally accepted that occurrence of sleep apneas in COPD is associated with 
a worse evolution of the disease. Nocturnal polysomnographic monitoring in COPD 
is usually performed when coexistence of sleep apnea ("overlap syndrome") is 
suspected, while in most other cases nocturnal oximetry may be enough. Nocturnal 
oxygen attenuates sleep desaturations among stable patients, without increases 
in PaCO2 of clinical concern. Nocturnal treatment with positive pressure 
ventilators may give benefit to some stable hypercapnic subjects and patients 
with the overlap syndrome.

Studies on free radicals, antioxidants, and co-factors.

England, UK. k.rahman@ljmu.ac.uk

The interplay between free radicals, antioxidants, and co-factors is important 
in maintaining health, aging and age-related diseases. Free radicals induce 
oxidative stress, which is balanced by the body's endogenous antioxidant systems 
with an input from co-factors, and by the ingestion of exogenous antioxidants. 
If the generation of free radicals exceeds the protective effects of 
antioxidants, and some co-factors, this can cause oxidative damage which 
accumulates during the life cycle, and has been implicated in aging, and age 
dependent diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative 
disorders, and other chronic conditions. The life expectancy of the world 
population is increasing, and it is estimated that by 2025, 29% of the world 
population will be aged > or = 60 years, and this will lead to an increase in 
the number of older people acquiring age-related chronic diseases. This will 
place greater financial burden on health services and high social cost for 
individuals and society. In order to acheive healthy aging the older people 
should be encouraged to acquire healthy life styles which should include diets 
rich in antioxidants. The aim of this review is to highlight the main themes 
from studies on free radicals, antioxidants and co-factors, and to propose an 
evidence-based strategy for healthy aging.

After the increasing rate of deaths observed during the 1980s due to human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the health-related quality of life and 
life expectancy of persons with hemophilia have improved, mainly due to the 
progresses of replacement therapy and antiviral drugs and to the improvement of 
the global comprehensive care provided by specialized centers. As a consequence, 
an increasing number of hemophiliacs have reached an older age and nowadays 
physicians in hemophilia centers find that they must handle age-related clinical 
problems never previously observed in this population. The management of elderly 
persons with congenital hemophilia is discussed in the first part of this 
review. The second part describes the general aspects of acquired hemophilia due 
to anti-factor VIII autoantibodies, focusing on the clinical management of 
elderly patients, one of the groups most frequently affected by this acquired 
bleeding disorder.

The aging process and potential interventions to extend life expectancy.

Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.

Aging is commonly defined as the accumulation of diverse deleterious changes 
occurring in cells and tissues with advancing age that are responsible for the 
increased risk of disease and death. The major theories of aging are all 
specific of a particular cause of aging, providing useful and important insights 
for the understanding of age-related physiological changes. However, a global 
view of them is needed when debating of a process which is still obscure in some 
of its aspects. In this context, the search for a single cause of aging has 
recently been replaced by the view of aging as an extremely complex, 
multifactorial process. Therefore, the different theories of aging should not be 
considered as mutually exclusive, but complementary of others in the explanation 
of some or all the features of the normal aging process. To date, no convincing 
evidence showing the administration of existing "anti-aging" remedies can slow 
aging or increase longevity in humans is available. Nevertheless, several 
studies on animal models have shown that aging rates and life expectancy can be 
modified. The present review provides an overlook of the most commonly accepted 
theories of aging, providing current evidence of those interventions aimed at 
modifying the aging process.

Norway.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of a PCR-amplified 16S rDNA 
sequence was used to characterize changes in the microbial flora caused by ozone 
(O3) treatment of farmed cod (Gadus morhua). Portions of cod were produced under 
controlled conditions, bathed in fresh water supplemented with 2 ppm of O3 for 
30 min, and packaged in modified atmosphere (MA: 60% CO2 and 40% N2) before 4 
degrees C storage. Control samples were packaged in MA or air, without prior O3 
treatment. Samples were analyzed by PCR-DGGE to determine the predominant 
bacterial flora and to examine possible differences in the microbial community 
due to O3 treatment. The DGGE analysis during the storage period showed that the 
O3 treatment produced no significant difference in the microbial flora compared 
with the controls. Sequencing of 16S rDNA detected the specific spoilage 
bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum, Pseudomonas spp., Shewanella baltica, and 
Shewanella putrefaciens as the predominant bacteria in all samples. PCR-DGGE 
results were supported by culture and sensory analyses used in predicting 
product shelf life. Aerobic plate count, H2S-producing bacteria, and 
psychrotrophic bacterial counts demonstrated no significant extension of the 
shelf life of MA-packaged, O3-treated cod fillets.

Impact of late-life self-reported emotional problems on Disability-Free Life 
Expectancy: results from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.

OBJECTIVES: Depression in old age is a major public health problem though its 
relationship to onset of disability and death is not well understood. We aim to 
quantify the impact of late-life self-reported depression and emotional problems 
on both the length and quality of remaining life.
METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of 11,022 individuals from the MRC Cognitive 
Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS), multi-centre longitudinal study on ageing 
in individuals age 65 years and older living in England and Wales. Individuals 
have been followed at intermittent time intervals over 10 years. Subjects 
reporting at baseline that they had consulted about emotional problems for the 
first time since the age of 60 years were considered, along with a subgroup 
where a GP suggested depression. Disability was defined as an IADL or ADL 
disability that required help at least once a week. Total and Disability-Free 
Life Expectancy (TLE and DFLE) were calculated using multi-state models, 
separately by gender, and with presence of emotional problems/depression and 
multimorbidity as covariates.
RESULTS: Emotional problems had a greater impact on DFLE than TLE, reducing DFLE 
by 1.8 years, but TLE by only 0.5 years at age 65 with the effect increasing 
with age. The effect was most marked in older people reporting other 
co-morbidities where emotional problems in addition resulted in a reduction of 
0.9 years in total and 2.6 years disability-free.
CONCLUSIONS: Although emotional problems were only self-reported, these results 
highlight the burden of late-life depression on the quality of remaining years 
of life.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic renal failure increase with the age. The 
selection of patient to dialysis has been increasing in spite of the high 
comorbidity. Moreover, in our clinical practice the aged patient is not 
contraindicated to dialysis. However, in the nephrology clinical practice not 
all the patients start the treatment with dialysis. OBJECTIVE The aim of our 
study has been to compare the characteristics of the patients who had not been 
dialyzed between the periods 1992-1995 and 2000-2003 to analyze the trend of the 
nephrology clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comparative study of the characteristics and the evolution 
of patients with chronic renal failure in stage V, (renal failure) not 
incorporated to dialysis in one hospital during four years between the periods 
the 1992-1995 ( period A) and 2000-2003 (period B).
RESULTS: Start dialysis (period A versus period B): 116 patients, age 59.9+15.5 
years vs. 229 patients, age 64.0+15.8 years (p<0.05). Non-dialysis (period A 
versus period B): 38 patients, age 77.5+9.3 years vs. 37 patients, age 81.7+6.2 
years (p<0.01). Renal function: serum creatinina 7.4+2.4 mg/dl vs. 5.3+1.2 mg/dl 
(p<0.001), MDRD estimate glomerular filtration 6.9+2.4 mg/dl ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 
10.0+2.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001). Primary renal disease: unknown etiology 31.5 
% vs. 24.3 %, nephroangiosclerosis 23.6 % vs. 32.4 %, diabetes 28.9 % vs. 21.6 
%. Functional status: dependent patients 34.2 % vs 83.8 % (p<0.001). The 
principal reason for non-dialysis were: personal decision: 26.3 % vs. 35.1 %, 
dementia 15.8 % vs. 29.7 %, brief life expectancy because of serious co-existing 
diseases 13.1 % vs. 21.7 % and serious chronic illness with inability for 
themselves care 44.7 % vs. 13.1 %. Comorbid conditions: 2.3+1.0 vs. 3.0+1.5 
(p<0.05). Survival: 55+168 days vs. 168+236 days (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Most of the patients that don't begin dialysis are elderly together 
with a poor functional capacity and with more autonomy in their decisions. The 
identification of patients with renal failure (stage V) was detected early in 
the last period than in the following one. The conservative management of 
non-dialyzed uremic patients is a significative nephrology clinical practice due 
to more survival of those persons.

BACKGROUND: It is thought that excessive alcohol consumption is related to the 
high mortality among working age men in Russia. Moreover it has been suggested 
that alcohol is a key proximate driver of the very sharp fluctuations in 
mortality seen in this group since the mid-1980s. Designing an individual-level 
study suitable to address the potential acute effects of alcohol consumption on 
mortality in Russia has posed a challenge to epidemiologists, especially because 
of the need to identify factors that could underlie the rapid changes up and 
down in mortality rates that have been such a distinctive feature of the Russian 
mortality crisis. In order to address this study question which focuses on 
exposures acting shortly before sudden death, a cohort would be unfeasibly large 
and would suffer from recruitment bias.
METHODS: Although the situation in Russia is unusual, with a very high death 
rate characterised by many sudden and apparently unexpected deaths in young men, 
the methodological problem is common to research on any cause of death where 
many deaths are sudden.
RESULTS: We describe the development of an innovative approach that has overcome 
some of these challenges: a case-control study employing proxy informants and 
external data sources to collect information about proximate determinants of 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: This offers a set of principles that can be adopted by 
epidemiologists studying sudden and unexpected deaths in other settings.

Incremental dental development: methods and applications in hominoid 
evolutionary studies.

Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany. tsmith@eva.mpg.de

This survey of dental microstructure studies reviews recent methods used to 
quantify developmental variables (daily secretion rate, periodicity of 
long-period lines, extension rate, formation time) and applications to the study 
of hominoid evolution. While requisite preparative and analytical methods are 
time consuming, benefits include more precise identification of tooth crown 
initiation and completion than conventional radiographic approaches. 
Furthermore, incremental features facilitate highly accurate estimates of the 
speed and duration of crown and root formation, stress experienced during 
development (including birth), and age at death. These approaches have provided 
insight into fossil hominin and Miocene hominoid life histories, and have also 
been applied to ontogenetic and taxonomic studies of fossil apes and humans. It 
is shown here that, due to the rapidly evolving nature of dental microstructure 
studies, numerous methods have been applied over the past few decades to 
characterize the rate and duration of dental development. Yet, it is often 
unclear whether data derived from different methods are comparable or which 
methods are the most accurate. Areas for future research are identified, 
including the need for validation and standardization of certain methods, and 
new methods for integrating nondestructive structural and developmental studies 
are highlighted.
