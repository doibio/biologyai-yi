OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prospective testing for HLA-B*58:01, as a 
strategy to prevent serious adverse reactions to allopurinol in patients with 
gout, is cost-effective from the perspective of the National Health Service in 
the UK.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association of 
HLA-B*58:01 with cutaneous and hypersensitivity adverse drug reactions informed 
a decision analytic and Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes 
associated with testing vs standard care (with febuxostat prescribed for 
patients who test positive). Scenario analyses assessed alternative treatment 
assumptions and patient populations.
RESULTS: The number of patients needed to test to prevent one case of adverse 
drug reaction was 11 286 (95% central range (CR): 2573, 53 594). Cost and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains were small, £103 (95% CR: £98, £106) and 
0.0023 (95% CR: -0.0006, 0.0055), respectively, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £44 954 per QALY gained. The probability of 
testing being cost-effective at a threshold of £30 000 per QALY was 0.25. 
Reduced costs of testing or febuxostat resulted in an ICER below £30 000 per 
QALY gained. The ICER for patients with chronic renal insufficiency was £38 478 
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Routine testing for HLA-B*58:01 in order to reduce the incidence of 
adverse drug reactions in patients being prescribed allopurinol for gout is 
unlikely to be cost-effective in the UK; however testing is expected to become 
cost-effective with reductions in the cost of genotyping, and with the future 
availability of cheaper, generic febuxostat.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To document racial/ethnic and nativity differences by 
gender in cognitive life expectancies among older adults in the United States.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sullivan-based life tables were used to estimate 
cognitively normal, cognitively impaired/no dementia (CIND), and dementia life 
expectancies by gender for White, Black, U.S.-born Hispanic, and foreign-born 
Hispanic adults 50 years and older in the Health and Retirement Study.
RESULTS: Among women, the number of years spent living with dementia for Whites, 
Blacks, U.S.-born Hispanics, and foreign-born Hispanics was 1.6, 3.9, 4.7, and 
6.0 years, respectively. For men, Whites lived 1.1 years with dementia compared 
to 3.1 years for Blacks, 3.0 years for U.S.-born Hispanics and 3.2 years for 
foreign-born Hispanics. Similar patterns were observed for race/ethnic and 
nativity differences in CIND life expectancies. Blacks and Hispanics spend a 
larger fraction of their remaining years with CIND and dementia relative to 
Whites, regardless of gender. Foreign-born Hispanic men and women and Black men 
are particularly disadvantaged in the proportion of years spent after age 50 
with CIND and/or dementia.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Disparities in cognitive life expectancies indicate 
that intervention strategies should target the specific needs of minority and 
immigrant older adults with dementia. Given that education is a strong predictor 
of cognitive health, improving access to the social and economic resources that 
delay dementia onset is key to improving the well-being of diverse older adults.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy has resulted in more older patients at 
trauma centers. Traditional assessments of injuries alone may not be sufficient; 
age, comorbidities, and medications should be considered.
METHODS: 446 older trauma patients were analyzed in two groups, 45-65 years and 
<65, using Injury Severity Score (ISS), the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), 
and Comorbidity-Polypharmacy Score (CPS).
RESULTS: CCI and CPS were associated with HLOS in patients <65. In patients aged 
45-65, only CPS was associated with HLOS. CPS was inversely associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients <65, but not patients aged 45-65. CCI score 
was not associated with in-hospital mortality in either group.
CONCLUSION: Increased CCI and CPS were associated with increased HLOS. In 
patients over 65, increased CPS was associated with decreased mortality. This 
could be due to return toward physiologic normalcy in treated patients not seen 
in their peers with undiagnosed or untreated comorbidities.

Formation of 100S ribosome dimer is generally associated with translation 
suppression in bacteria. Trans-acting factors ribosome modulation factor (RMF) 
and hibernating promoting factor (HPF) were shown to directly mediate this 
process in E. coli. Gram-positive S. aureus lacks an RMF homolog and the 
structural basis for its 100S formation was not known. Here we report the 
cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native 100S ribosome from S. aureus, 
revealing the molecular mechanism of its formation. The structure is distinct 
from previously reported analogs and relies on the HPF C-terminal extension 
forming the binding platform for the interactions between both of the small 
ribosomal subunits. The 100S dimer is formed through interactions between rRNA 
h26, h40, and protein uS2, involving conformational changes of the head as well 
as surface regions that could potentially prevent RNA polymerase from docking to 
the ribosome.Under conditions of nutrient limitation, bacterial ribosomes 
undergo dimerization, forming a 100S complex that is translationally inactive. 
Here the authors present the structural basis for formation of the 100S 
complexes in Gram-positive bacteria, shedding light on the mechanism of 
translation suppression by the ribosome-silencing factors.

Synergistic Effect of Nano-Sliver with Sucrose on Extending Vase Life of the 
Carnation cv. Edun.

We investigated the effects of sucrose and nano-silver (NAg) on extending the 
vase life of cut carnation flowers "Edun". Sucrose (pulse treatment) suppressed 
ethylene production by downregulating the genes that code for its biosynthesis. 
Relative to the control, however, sucrose significantly promoted xylem blockage 
on cut stem surfaces and reduced relative fresh weight, antioxidant activity, 
and cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene (DcCPi) expression. Consequently, the 
sucrose-treated flowers had shorter vase lives than the control. In contrast, 
NAg suppressed ethylene production in the petal, prevented xylem blockage in the 
cut stem surface, and improved all the aforementioned parameters. Therefore, NAg 
increased flower longevity. The most effective treatment in terms of longevity 
extension and parameter improvement, however, was the combination of NAg and 
sucrose. These results suggest that sucrose can suppress ethylene production but 
does not necessarily extend the vase life of the flower cultivar. The role of 
NAg in increasing cut carnation longevity is mainly to inhibit xylem blockage 
rather than suppress ethylene production, and the combined effect of NAg and 
sucrose is most effective at prolonging cut carnation vase life, likely due to 
their synergetic effects on multiple modes of action.

The integrity of the cellular proteome is supported by quality control networks, 
which govern protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. It is generally 
accepted that an age-related decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) 
contributes to protein aggregation diseases. However, the mechanistic principles 
underlying proteostasis imbalance and the impact on life expectancy are not well 
understood. We recently demonstrated that this interrelation is affected by 
chaperone-directed ubiquitylation, shifting the amount of the conserved 
DAF-2/insulin receptor both in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila 
melanogaster. The ubiquitin ligase CHIP either targets the membrane bound 
insulin receptor or misfolded proteins for degradation, which depends on the 
cellular proteostasis status. Increased proteotoxicity triggers 
chaperone-assisted redirection of CHIP toward protein aggregates, limiting its 
capacity to degrade the insulin receptor and prevent premature aging. In light 
of these findings, we discuss a new concept for understanding the impact of 
proteome imbalance on longevity risk.

BACKGROUND: Sacubitril/valsartan reduces cardiovascular death and 
hospitalizations for heart failure (HF). However, decision-makers need to 
determine whether its benefits are worth the additional costs, given the 
low-cost generic status of traditional standard of care.
AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared to 
enalapril in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, from the Singapore 
healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project clinical and economic outcomes 
of sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril for 66-year-old patients with HF over 10 
years. Key health states included New York Heart Association classes I-IV and 
deaths; patients in each state incurred a monthly risk of hospitalization for HF 
and cardiovascular death. Sacubitril/valsartan benefits were modeled by applying 
the hazard ratios (HRs) in PARADIGM-HF trial to baseline probabilities. Primary 
model outcomes were total and incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
sacubitril/valsartan relative to enalapril Results: Compared to enalapril, 
sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an ICER of SGD 74,592 (USD 55,198) per 
QALY gained. A major driver of cost-effectiveness was the cardiovascular 
mortality benefit of sacubitril/valsartan. The uncertainty of this treatment 
benefit in the Asian sub-group was tested in sensitivity analyses using a HR of 
1 as an upper limit, where the ICERs ranged from SGD 41,019 (USD 30,354) to SGD 
1,447,103 (USD 1,070,856) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
showed the probability of sacubitril/valsartan being cost-effective was below 
1%, 12%, and 71% at SGD 20,000, SGD 50,000, and SGD 100,000 per QALY gained, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: At the current daily price sacubitril/valsartan may not represent 
good value for limited healthcare dollars compared to enalapril in reducing 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HF in the Singapore healthcare 
setting. This study highlights the cost-benefit trade-off that healthcare 
professionals and patients face when considering therapy.

AIMS: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telotristat ethyl (TE) 
added to somatostatin analog octreotide (SSA + TE) compared to octreotide alone 
(SSA) in patients with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea (CSD) whose symptoms remain 
uncontrolled with SSA alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deterministic Markov model evaluated the costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained with SSA + TE vs SSA per a third-party 
US payer perspective. The model reflected clinical practice and resource use 
estimates based on current standards of care, with utility estimates based on 
similar symptoms from ulcerative colitis. Treatment efficacy was based on the 
phase III clinical trial of SSA + TE vs SSA alone [TELESTAR, NCT01677910]. 
According to TELESTAR, 44% of SSA + TE and 20% of SSA patients responded to 
therapy after 12 weeks. At each 4-week assessment period, SSA patients not 
adequately controlled received increasing doses of SSA and SSA + TE patients 
discontinued TE and moved to SSA only. Drug costs for adequately and not 
adequately controlled patients were $4,291.75 and $5,890.57 for SSA, 
respectively, and $9,456.07 and $5,890.57 for SSA + TE, respectively.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 1.67 at a cost of 
$495,125 for the SSA cohort and 2.33 ($590,087) for SSA + TE with an incremental 
QALY for SSA + TE of 0.66 for an additional $94,962. The incremental cost per 
QALY gained was $142,545. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated high probability 
(>99%) of SSA + TE being cost-effective at thresholds for rare diseases and 
orphan drugs of $300,000-$450,000.
LIMITATIONS: The recent availability of TE precluded the incorporation of 
clinical and economic inputs based on real-world practice patterns. The scarcity 
of epidemiology and utility information for this rare condition required the use 
of some proxy estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated TE is a cost-effective treatment option 
when used on top of standard of care in CSD patients.

This study explores whether the National Health Information Database (NHID) can 
be used to monitor health status of entire population in Korea. We calculated 
the crude mortality rate and life expectancy (LE) at birth across the national, 
provincial, and municipal levels using the NHID eligibility database from 2004 
to 2015, and compared the results with the corresponding values obtained from 
the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) of Statistics Korea. The 
study results showed that the ratio of crude mortality rate between the two data 
was 0.99. The absolute difference between the LE of the two data was not more 
than 0.5 years, and did not exceed 0.3 years in gender specific results. The 
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) between the crude mortality rates 
from NHID and the rates from KOSIS ranged 0.997-0.999 among the municipalities. 
For LE, the CCC between the NHID and KOSIS across the municipalities were 0.990 
in 2004-2009 and 0.985 in 2010-2015 among men, and 0.952 in 2004-2009 and 0.914 
in 2010-2015 among women, respectively. Overall, the NHID was a good source for 
monitoring mortality and LE across national, provincial, and municipal levels 
with the population representativeness of entire Korean population. The results 
of this study indicate that NHID may well contribute to the national health 
promotion policy as a part of the health and health equity monitoring system.

OBJECTIVE: Studies using relative measures, such as standardized mortality 
ratios, have shown that patients with epilepsy have an increased mortality. 
Reports on more direct and absolute measure such as life expectancy are sparse. 
We report potential years lost and how life expectancy has changed over 40 years 
in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.
METHODS: We analyzed life expectancy in a cohort of adult patients diagnosed 
with definite epilepsy between 1970 and 2010. Those with brain tumor as cause of 
epilepsy were excluded. By retrospective probabilistic record linkage, living or 
death status was derived from the national death registry. We estimated life 
expectancy by a Weibull regression model using gender, age at diagnosis, 
epilepsy etiology, and year of diagnosis as covariates at time of epilepsy 
diagnosis, and 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after diagnosis. Results were compared to 
the general population, and 95% confidence intervals are given.
RESULTS: There were 249 deaths (105 women, age at death 19.0-104.0 years) in 
1,112 patients (11,978.4 person-years, 474 women, 638 men). A substantial 
decrease in life expectancy was observed for only a few subgroups, strongly 
depending on epilepsy etiology and time of diagnosis: time of life lost was 
highest in patients with symptomatic epilepsy diagnosed between 1970 and 1980; 
the impact declined with increasing time from diagnosis. Over half of the 
analyzed subgroups did not differ significantly from the general population. 
This effect was reversed in the later decades, and life expectancy was prolonged 
in some subgroups, reaching a maximum in those with newly diagnosed idiopathic 
and cryptogenic epilepsy between 2001 and 2010.
SIGNIFICANCE: Life expectancy is reduced in symptomatic epilepsies. However, in 
other subgroups, a prolonged life expectancy was found, which has not been 
reported previously. Reasons may be manifold and call for further study.

BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects (NTDs), the second most frequent cause of human 
congenital abnormalities, are debilitating birth defects due to failure of 
neural tube closure. It has been shown that noncanonical WNT/planar cell 
polarity (PCP) signaling is required for convergent extension (CE), the 
initiation step of neural tube closure (NTC). But the effect of canonical 
WNT//β-catenin signaling during NTC is still elusive. LRP6 (low density 
lipoprotein receptor related proteins 6) was identified as a co-receptor for 
WNT/β-catenin signaling, but recent studies showed that it also can mediate 
WNT/PCP signaling.
METHODS: In this study, we screened mutations in the LRP6 gene in 343 NTDs and 
215 ethnically matched normal controls of Chinese Han population.
RESULTS: Three rare missense mutations (c.1514A>G, p.Y505C); c.2984A>G, p.D995G; 
and c.4280C>A, p.P1427Q) of the LRP6 gene were identified in Chinese NTD 
patients. The Y505C mutation is a loss-of-function mutation on both 
WNT/β-catenin and PCP signaling. The D995G mutation only partially lost 
inhibition on PCP signaling without affecting WNT/β-catenin signaling. The 
P1427Q mutation dramatically increased WNT/β-catenin signaling but only mildly 
loss of inhibition on PCP signaling. All three mutations failed to rescue CE 
defects caused by lrp6 morpholino oligos knockdown in zebrafish. Of interest, 
when overexpressed, D995G did not induce any defects, but Y505C and P1427Q 
caused more severe CE defects in zebrafish.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that over-active canonical WNT signaling 
induced by gain-of-function mutation in LRP6 could also contribute to human 
NTDs, and a balanced WNT/β-catenin and PCP signaling is probably required for 
proper neural tube development. Birth Defects Research 110:63-71, 2018. © 2017

The main objective of this study is to estimate the monetary value of the gains 
of healthy days and life expectancy due to the ambient air quality standard that 
came into effect in 2014 by estimating the country-specific value of a life year 
(VOLY) and the value of the healthier and longer life (VHLL) for Turkey. 
Contingent valuation method is adopted to reveal individuals' willingness to pay 
for an improvement of health condition and the extension of their life 
expectancy by avoiding respiratory and lung related illnesses. VHLL is composed 
of two parts, WTP for an extension of one's life years (VOLY) and for an 
increase in the number of healthy days throughout one's life time (VHLL-VOLY). 
We found that close to 80% of WTP is allocated to the latter component of VHLL 
and only 20% is for VOLY mainly due to Islamic beliefs of the respondents. A 
total of 1314 observations are collected by face-to-face interviews from 
Afsin-Elbistan, Kutahya-Tavsanli and Ankara. The estimated VHLL and VOLY are 
[41,750 TL, 10,258 TL] with all the observations, [30,185 TL, 7132 TL] for 
Afsin-Elbistan, [31,718 TL, 7081 TL] for Kutahya-Tavsanli and [52,334 TL, 14,813 
TL] for Ankara. The Inverse-U shaped relationship between Age and WTP is 
confirmed. The income elasticities of WTP is found to be close to 0.5 for all 
study areas while an Inverse-U shaped relationship between the household income 
and Income Elasticity of WTP is observed in the income group based analysis. Age 
and household income are the two prominent determinants of VHLL.

BACKGROUND: Fluctuations in the national economy shape labour market 
opportunities and outcomes, which in turn influence the health conditions of 
older workers. This study examined whether overall economic shifts during the 
2008 recession was associated with four health indicators among older workers.
METHOD: Data came from 4917 respondents (16 090 contacts) aged 50-70 in 13 
European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) participating in 
the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Health and employment 
assessments from 2004-13 were linked to annual data on fluctuations in Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy and unemployment rates for 
each country. Using fixed effects models, we assessed the recession's 
implications on four individual health outcomes: body mass index (BMI), drinking 
alcohol, depression and general health, while isolating cyclical variation 
within countries and individual changes over time.
RESULTS: Overall economic shifts had an effect on older workers: decreases in 
GDP were associated with a decline in average BMI, consumption of alcohol and 
deterioration in self-rated health; country-level unemployment rate had no 
effect on health outcomes, while life expectancy at birth was significant but 
not consistently across models. Being employed or retired were associated with 
fewer depressive symptoms and better self-rated health.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall economic shifts during recessions affect certain health 
outcomes of older workers, and better health conditions together with being 
employed or retired may limit the negative health consequences of a recession.

Understanding how host-crop genotypes affect the life history of insect pests is 
important for developing and using varietal resistance as a pest control 
measure. Here we determined how wild and cultivated sugarcane genotypes affect 
key life-history traits and the demographic performance of the root spittlebug, 
Mahanarva fimbriolata (Stål; Hemiptera: Cercopidae), a major pest of sugarcane, 
which produces most of the world's sugar and bioethanol. In the greenhouse, 
plants of four sugarcane genotypes (two wild and two cultivated) were infested 
with newly-ecloded spittlebug nymphs. A longitudinal life-table experiment was 
conducted recording developmental time, survival, reproductive output, and 
longevity of the released spittlebug nymphs. One of the promising sugarcane 
genotypes was the accession IM76-229 (Saccharum robustum Brandes & Jesw. ex 
Grassl), which allowed only 20% of nymph survival to adulthood and reduced the 
spittlebug longevity by 10 d. Such effects on these life-history traits led to a 
negative intrinsic rate of population growth (rm = -0.002) of the insects, 
indicating that the test population would eventually go extinct on this 
sugarcane genotype. An opposite trend (i.e., population growth) was obtained for 
the insects raised on Saccharum spp. (SP81-3250 and SP80-1816 cultivars) and 
Erianthus arundinaceus (Retz) Jeswiet (Kawandang genotype). These results show 
that S. robustum IM76-229 genotype has resistance traits that drastically reduce 
spittlebug population growth and indicate that it can be used in breeding 
programs aiming to develop sugarcane cultivars with resistance to spittlebugs.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer 
and other malignant and benign neoplastic lesions. HPV vaccination has three 
potential goals: to prevent transmission, infection, and disease. At present, 
there are no available data about health consequences of HPV immunization in 
Italy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of current HPV 
vaccination strategy in Italy.
METHODS: A multistate morbidity-mortality model was developed to estimate the 
infection process in a theoretical cohort of Italian women. The Markov process 
considered nine health states (health, anogenital warts, grade 1 and grade 2/3 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, anal cancer, death due to 
cervical cancer, anal cancer and other causes), and 26 transition probabilities 
for each age group. The model was informed with the available data in national 
and international literature. Effectiveness of immunization was assumed 
considering a literature review pertaining to models and vaccination coverage 
rates observed in Italy. Life expectancy (ex), Quality-Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs), Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and attributable risk (AR) were 
estimated for no intervention (cervical cancer screening) and vaccination 
strategies scenarios.
RESULTS: The model showed that in a cohort of 100,000 Italian women the e0 is 
equal to 83.1 years. With current HPV vaccination strategy the e0 achieves 83.2 
(+0.1) years. When HPV-related diseases are considered altogether, the QALYs 
increase from 82.7 to 82.9 (+0.2 QALYs) with no intervention and vaccination 
strategies respectively. DALYs decrease by 0.6 due to vaccination. Finally, AR 
is equal to 93 and 265 cases per 100,000 women in population and not vaccinated, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: When mortality due to cervical cancer is considered, HPV vaccination 
seems to have a low impact on health unit gains in the Italian female 
population. Conversely, when several HPV-related and cancer morbidity conditions 
are included, the effect of vaccination becomes quite remarkable.

AIMS: To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB) kyphosis, 
with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence of restrictive 
lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively 
collected imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients of 
Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean of 113° of 
kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria were reviewed. Plain 
radiographs were used to assess the degree of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT 
and MRI were used when available to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and 
canal. Patient demographics, age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types 
of surgical procedure, intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological 
status were assessed.
RESULTS: All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB 
chemotherapy when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently 
received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity correction 
in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to 59) since these surgical 
interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered from late neurological 
deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to 49) after the initial drug treatment. 
The causes of neurological deterioration were healed disease in nine patients 
(56.2%), re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal 
stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse in healed 
disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration received surgery to 
correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged from 97° to 72°. Three patients 
who were clinically quiescent with no neurological deterioration were found to 
have active TB of the spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no 
patient suffered from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On 
final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range: 47 years 
to 75 years).
CONCLUSION: Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB with 
severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant health problems 
many years following the initial drug treatment. Early surgical correction of 
the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular surveillance may avoid late 
complications. Paraplegia, restrictive lung disease and early onset kyphosis 
might relate to early death. Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure.

A fundamental challenge faced by the immune system is to discriminate contexts 
meriting activation from contexts in which activation would be harmful. 
Selection pressures on this ability are likely to be acute: the penalty of 
mis-identification of pathogens (therefore failure to attack them) is mortality 
or morbidity linked to infectious disease, which could reduce fitness by 
reducing lifespan or fertility; the penalty associated with mis-identification 
of host (therefore self-attack) is immunopathology, whose fitness costs can also 
be extreme. Here we use classic epidemiological tools to frame this trade-off 
between sensitivity and specificity of immune activation, exploring implications 
for evolution of immune discrimination. We capture the expected increase in the 
evolutionarily optimal sensitivity under higher pathogen mortality risk, and a 
decrease in sensitivity with increased immunopathology mortality risk; but a 
number of non-intuitive predictions also emerge. All else being equal, optimal 
sensitivity decreases with increasing lifespan; and, where sensitivity can vary 
over age, decreases at late ages not solely attributable to immunosenescence are 
predicted. These results both enrich and challenge previous predictions 
concerning the relationship between life expectancy and optimal evolved 
defenses, highlighting the need to account for epidemiological setting, 
lifestage-specific immune priorities, and immune discrimination in future 
investigations.

Sexual dimorphisms account for differences in clinical manifestations or 
incidence of infectious or autoimmune diseases and malignancy between females 
and males. Females develop enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses than 
males and are less susceptible to many infections of bacterial, viral, 
parasitic, and fungal origin and malignancies but in contrast, they are more 
prone to develop autoimmune diseases. The higher susceptibility to infections in 
males is observed from birth to adulthood, suggesting that sex chromosomes and 
not sex hormones have a major role in sexual dimorphism in innate immunity. 
Sex-based regulation of immune responses ultimately contributes to age-related 
disease development and life expectancy. Differences between males and females 
have been described in the expression of pattern recognition receptors of the 
innate immune response and in the functional responses of phagocytes and antigen 
presenting cells. Different factors have been shown to account for the sex-based 
disparity in immune responses, including genetic factors and hormonal mediators, 
which contribute independently to dimorphism in the innate immune response. For 
instance, several genes encoding for innate immune molecules are located on the 
X chromosome. In addition, estrogen and/or testosterone have been reported to 
modulate the differentiation, maturation, lifespan, and effector functions of 
innate immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, 
and dendritic cells. In this review, we will focus on differences between males 
and females in innate immunity, which represents the first line of defense 
against pathogens and plays a fundamental role in the activation, regulation, 
and orientation of the adaptive immune response.

OBJECTIVES: The management of patients with recurrent neck cancer invading the 
carotid artery is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
overall survival and healthy survival years (QALY) as well as the patency of 
carotid revascularization after enbloc tumor resection followed by complementary 
radiotherapy.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 42 consecutive patients with recurrent neck cancer 
invading the carotid artery underwent resection of the tumor associated with 
reconstruction of the carotid artery with a PTFE prosthesis (n=31) or with a 
saphenous vein graft (n=11). In 11 cases, resection was associated with 
musculocutaneous flap coverage. The primary tumor was a squamous cell carcinoma 
of the larynx (20 patients) or of the pharynx (9 patients), undifferentiated 
carcinoma of unknown origin (10 patients) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (3 
patients). All patients had postoperative radiotherapy (50-70Gy) supplemented in 
16 of them by chemotherapy. Nine patients had metastatic dissemination at the 
time of reoperation with a recurrent tumor ulcerated to the skin in 5 of them.
RESULTS: The combined 30-day mortality and stroke rate was nil. Postoperative 
morbidity included dysphagia (n=8), vocal cord paralysis (n=6), late wound 
healing delay (n=2), transient mandibular claudication (n=1) and partial 
necrosis of the musculocutaneous flap (n=1). No infection and no thrombosis of 
the bypass were observed during follow-up [median: 31 months, range: 8-167 
months]. Twenty-one patients (50%) died from the consequences of the spread of 
cancer, which had become metastatic, but without local recurrence. The 5-year 
survival rate was 50.9±8.3%. The median healthy survival year (QALY) was 3.38 
[95% CI: 1.70-4.54] with a significant difference between patients without 
metastasis at the time of reoperation [n=33; QALY=4.02] and those with 
metastases [n=9; QALY=0.43; P=0.005]. Healthy life expectancy was also 
significantly longer in patients with laryngeal cancer [n=20, QALY=4.95] 
compared to patients with other types of tumors [n=22, QALY=1.67; P=0.032].
CONCLUSION: In the absence of metastases, enbloc resection of recurrent neck 
cancers invading the carotid artery improves the duration and quality of patient 
survival.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of natriuretic peptide (NP) 
testing and specialist outreach in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) 
residing off the cardiology ward.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for patients presenting to hospital with suspected AHF. We 
examined diagnostic workup with and without the NP test in suspected new cases, 
and we examined the impact of specialist heart failure outreach in all suspected 
cases. Inputs for the model were derived from systematic reviews, the UK 
national heart failure audit, randomized controlled trials, expert consensus 
from a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline development 
group, and a national online survey. The main benefit from specialist care 
(cardiology ward and specialist outreach) was the increased likelihood of 
discharge on disease-modifying drugs for people with left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, which improve mortality and reduce re-admissions due to worsened 
heart failure (associated with lower utility). Costs included diagnostic 
investigations, admissions, pharmacological therapy, and follow-up heart failure 
care.
RESULTS: NP testing and specialist outreach are both higher cost, higher QALY, 
cost-effective strategies (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £11,656 and 
£2,883 per QALY gained, respectively). Combining NP and specialist outreach is 
the most cost-effective strategy. This result was robust to both univariate 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: NP testing for the diagnostic workup of new suspected AHF is 
cost-effective. The use of specialist heart failure outreach for inpatients with 
AHF residing off the cardiology ward is cost-effective. Both interventions will 
help improve outcomes for this high-risk group.
