neuroimaging features to epidemiologic risk factors, social determinants, and 
candidate treatments. Here we highlight some of the shared themes that cut 
across these distinct perspectives: (1) the lifetime course of vascular brain 
injury pathogenesis and progression; (2) the scientific and ethical imperative 
to extend vascular brain health research in non-White and non-affluent 
populations; (3) the need for improved tools to study the cerebral small vessels 
themselves; (4) the potential role for brain recovery mechanisms in determining 
vascular brain health and resilience; and (5) the cross-pathway mechanisms by 
which vascular and neurodegenerative processes may interact. The diverse 
perspectives featured in this Focused Update offer a sense of the 
multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations that will be required to launch 
our populations towards improved brain health and successful aging.

INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for registered nurses with gerontological 
competence within long-term care (LTC) of older adults. Despite increases of 
life expectancy, LTC for older adults is not emphasized in nursing curricula in 
neither Sweden nor Thailand. Thus, the aim was to explore conceptions on 
gerontological nursing (GN) among Swedish and Thai nurse educators.
METHOD: A qualitative phenomenographic method, based on open-ended interviews 
with five Thai and nine Swedish nurse educators was conducted.
RESULTS: The results indicate a paradox between the educators' knowledge about 
the implications of global aging, their hope of own aging, and LTC. The ethical 
responsibility of being credible and a source of inspiration in teaching about 
aging are focused, while GN seem to be less important.
DISCUSSION: To increase students' interest in GN, measures need to be taken 
within the educational arenas, where the educators' own conceptions toward GN, 
cultural aspects of aging, and LTC are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the impact of the burden of COVID-19 is key to 
successfully navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a larger investigation 
on COVID-19 mortality impact, this study aims to estimate the Potential Years of 
Life Lost (PYLL) in 17 countries and territories across the world (Australia, 
Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Peru, 
Norway, England & Wales, Scotland, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United 
States [USA]).
METHODS: Age- and sex-specific COVID-19 death numbers from primary national 
sources were collected by an international research consortium. The study period 
was established based on the availability of data from the inception of the 
pandemic to the end of August 2020. The PYLL for each country were computed 
using 80 years as the maximum life expectancy.
RESULTS: As of August 2020, 442,677 (range: 18-185,083) deaths attributed to 
COVID-19 were recorded in 17 countries which translated to 4,210,654 (range: 
112-1,554,225) PYLL. The average PYLL per death was 8.7 years, with substantial 
variation ranging from 2.7 years in Australia to 19.3 PYLL in Ukraine. North and 
South American countries as well as England & Wales, Scotland and Sweden 
experienced the highest PYLL per 100,000 population; whereas Australia, Slovenia 
and Georgia experienced the lowest. Overall, males experienced higher PYLL rate 
and higher PYLL per death than females. In most countries, most of the PYLL were 
observed for people aged over 60 or 65 years, irrespective of sex. Yet, Brazil, 
Cape Verde, Colombia, Israel, Peru, Scotland, Ukraine, and the USA concentrated 
most PYLL in younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the role of PYLL as a tool to understand the 
impact of COVID-19 on demographic groups within and across countries, guiding 
preventive measures to protect these groups under the ongoing pandemic. 
Continuous monitoring of PYLL is therefore needed to better understand the 
burden of COVID-19 in terms of premature mortality.

Benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 self-tests from a consumer's 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to quantify the health benefits, risks, and 
cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 self-tests from a consumer's perspective in 
Germany.
METHODS: The analysis is based on a modelling approach using secondary data. The 
clinical endpoints considered in this analysis are avoided SARS-CoV-2 infections 
and secondary severe clinical events (death, intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission, and long COVID syndrome). The study determines the number of 
self-tests that need to be conducted under a 7-day incidence of 75 per 100,000 
population to prevent one infection or severe clinical event. Furthermore, the 
study calculates the cost of testing per avoided clinical event and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a consumer perspective.
RESULTS: Disregarding the rate of unreported COVID-19 cases, 4556 self-tests 
need to be conducted (over 12 years) in order to avoid one undesirable event 
(death, intensive care unit stay, or long COVID syndrome). Ninety percent of 
infections are not avoided among direct contacts but along the chain of 
infection. The costs per quality-adjusted life year gained from a consumer's 
perspective are €5870. This ratio is particularly sensitive to the 7-day 
incidence, effective reproduction number, and the age of contacts.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of self-testing in the general population at a 7-day 
incidence rate of 75 per 100,000 appear to be minor. Nevertheless, 
cost-effectiveness may still be acceptable in the presence of higher-risk 
contacts given the low costs of self-test kits in Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of the modified Post-Stroke Checklist (mPSC) to 
identify impairments and care needs of patients with stroke (PwS) in an 
inpatient rehabilitation setting.
METHODS: Prospective observational design with consecutive admission of PwS 
(n = 44) at a tertiary rehabilitation facility. The post-stroke checklist was 
administered at hospital discharge (T1) and 3 months post-discharge (T2). 
Furthermore, validated questionnaires assessed function and participation, 
including the Clinical Functioning Information Tool (ClinFIT) on admission (T0), 
T1 and T2.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 67.7 years (standard deviation; SD) 14.6), 
58% of participants were female, and the mean length of inpatient stay was 32.7 
days (SD 22.4). At T1, 80% and at T2 only 60% of participants reported ≥1 
stroke-related problem (mean 5.3 (SD 3.3) and 3.6 (SD 2.8), respectively). Half 
of participants were referred to physiotherapy/occupational therapy, and 36% to 
specialist clinics following discharge. The most prevalent problems included: 
life after stroke (62.2%), fatigue (55.6%), activities of daily living, and 
mobility (51.1% each). Compared with T1, at T2 there was an observed reduction 
in all mPSC items, except pain and incontinence. Participants showed improved 
function at T1 and T2 (Extension Index, ClinFIT set), from T0 to T1 and T0 to T2 
(p<0.001, with large effect sizes).
CONCLUSION: The mPSC is feasible to implement in an inpatient rehabilitation 
setting and community. It can identify relevant stroke-related problems, and 
hence facilitate targeted intervention.

School of Medicine, Mineola, New York, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrotic lung 
disease characterized by dry cough, fatigue, and progressive exertional dyspnea. 
Lung parenchyma and architecture is destroyed, compliance is lost, and gas 
exchange is compromised in this debilitating condition that leads inexorably to 
respiratory failure and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. This review 
discusses treatment approaches to IPF in current use and those that appear 
promising for future development.
DATA SOURCE: The data were obtained from the Randomized Controlled Trials and 
scientific studies published in English literature. We used search terms related 
to IPF, antifibrotic treatment, lung transplant, and management.
RESULTS: Etiopathogenesis of IPF is not fully understood, and treatment options 
are limited. Pathological features of IPF include extracellular matrix 
remodeling, fibroblast activation and proliferation, immune dysregulation, cell 
senescence, and presence of aberrant basaloid cells. The mainstay therapies are 
the oral antifibrotic drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib, which can improve 
quality of life, attenuate symptoms, and slow disease progression. Unilateral or 
bilateral lung transplantation is the only treatment for IPF shown to increase 
life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Clearly, there is an unmet need for accelerated research into IPF 
mechanisms so that progress can be made in therapeutics toward the goals of 
increasing life expectancy, alleviating symptoms, and improving well-being.

Thermal Requirements and Life Table Parameters of Tomato Leaf Miner Tuta 
absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in Egypt.

S Rashwan R, El-Refai SA, Abdemaksoud EM.

&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; The tomato leaf miner, 
&lt;i&gt;Tuta absoluta&lt;/i&gt; (Meyrick) is being a serious pest to tomato 
cultivations in Egypt since 2009. The present study was carried out to calculate 
the developmental parameters of insects based on temperature degree. 
&lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The influence of 3 tested temperatures 
(20, 24, 28°C) were examined to evaluate its effect on the developmental stages 
of &lt;i&gt;T. absoluta&lt;/i&gt;. Developmental thresholds and needed heat 
units for insect stages were mathematically calculated according to 
developmental rates. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Developmental threshold for egg 
stage and mean thermal units were calculated to be 7°C and 86.2 DD's. The 
developmental threshold for the larval stage was 10°C, while mean thermal units 
were calculated to be 310.8 DD's. Percentages mortality of larval stage were 52, 
74, 74 and 100% at 20, 24, 28 and 32°C, respectively. For the pupal stage 
developmental threshold and mean thermal units required for completing the pupal 
stage was 11.2°C and 132.2 DD's. For an adult, zero of the developmental 
threshold female and of male were 11.2 and 9.8°C, respectively. The mean 
required heat units for female and male was 142.3 and 136.7 DD's Life table 
parameters such as net Reproduction Rate (R&lt;sub&gt;◦&lt;/sub&gt;), Mean 
Generation Time (Gt), Intrinsic Rate of Increase (r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), 
Finite Rate of Increase (λ) and Population Double Time (Dt) were calculated at 
three tested temperatures. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Estimating thermal 
heat units of &lt;i&gt;T. absoluta&lt;/i&gt; help in predicting the field 
generations of the insect and improve planning the integrated pest management.

Calcium-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis is mediated by SNARE complex 
formation. The transition from the Munc18-1/syntaxin-1 complex to the SNARE 
complex is catalyzed by the Munc13-1 MUN domain and involves at least two 
conformational changes: opening of the syntaxin-1 linker region and extension of 
Munc18-1 domain 3a. However, the relationship and the action order of the two 
conformational changes remain not fully understood. Here, our data show that an 
open conformation in the syntaxin-1 linker region can bypass the requirement of 
the MUN NF sequence. In addition, an extended state of Munc18-1 domain 3a can 
compensate the role of the syntaxin-1 RI sequence. Altogether, the current data 
strongly support our previous notion that opening of the syntaxin-1 linker 
region by Munc13-1 is a key step to initiate SNARE complex assembly, and 
consequently, Munc18-1 domain 3a can extend its conformation to serve as a 
template for association of synaptobrevin-2 and syntaxin-1.

Identification of Partner Proteins of the Algae Klebsormidium nitens NO 
Synthases: Toward a Better Understanding of NO Signaling in Eukaryotic 
Photosynthetic Organisms.

In animals, NO is synthesized from L-arginine by three isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS) enzyme. NO production and effects have also been reported in 
plants but the identification of its sources, especially the enzymatic ones, 
remains one of the critical issues in the field. NOS-like activities have been 
reported, although there are no homologs of mammalian NOS in the land plant 
genomes sequenced so far. However, several NOS homologs have been found in algal 
genomes and transcriptomes. A first study has characterized a functional NOS in 
the chlorophyte Ostreococcus tauri and the presence of NOS homologs was later 
confirmed in a dozen algae. These results raise the questions of the 
significance of the presence of NOS and their molecular diversity in algae. We 
hypothesize that comparisons among protein structures of the two KnNOS, together 
with the identification of their interacting partner proteins, might allow a 
better understanding of the molecular diversification and functioning of NOS in 
different physiological contexts and, more generally, new insights into NO 
signaling in photosynthetic organisms. We recently identified two NOS homologs 
sequences in the genome of the streptophyte Klebsormidium nitens, a model alga 
in the study of plant adaptation to terrestrial life. The first sequence, named 
KnNOS1, contains canonical NOS signatures while the second, named KnNOS2, 
presents a large C-ter extension including a globin domain. In order to identify 
putative candidates for KnNOSs partner proteins, we draw the protein-protein 
interaction networks of the three human NOS using the BioGRID database and 
hypothesized on the biological role of K. nitens orthologs. Some of these 
conserved partners are known to be involved in mammalian NOSs regulation and 
functioning. In parallel, our methodological strategy for the identification of 
partner proteins of KnNOS1 and KnNOS2 by in vitro pull-down assay is presented.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) has long been one of the most disability 
mental disorders and a major cause of health loss.
METHODS: Based on open access data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD 
2019) study, we extracted data of years lived with disability (YLD), years of 
life lost (YLL) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) to describe the 
changes of AUD burden over the period of 1990-2019 stratified by sex in globe, 
high-income countries (HICs), upper-middle income countries (UMCs), lower-middle 
income countries (LMCs), low-income countries (LICs) and China. We used 
Joinpoint regression model to fit the changing trend of years. And pairwise 
comparison was applied to test the coincidence parallelism and judge whether the 
difference of the trend among different regions is statistically significant.
RESULTS: LMCs experienced the largest changes in the YLD rate of AUD from 1990 
to 2019 (average annual percent change (AAPC) = -0.7, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = -0.8, -0.7, P < 0.05), with China experienced a higher increase in 1990 
to 1993 (annual percent change (APC) = 3.8, 95% CI = 3.2, 4.4, P < 0.05) than 
other regions, and the rate of decline in China from 1996 to 2002 (APC = -3.4, 
95% CI = -3.6, -3.1, P < 0.05) was higher than that in other regions. UMCs 
experienced the largest changes in the YLL rate of AUD from 1990 to 2019 
(AAPC = -1.1, 95% CI = -1.6, -0.6, P < 0.05), with a larger decline in 2004 to 
2012 (APC = -6.2, 95% CI = -6.7, -5.7, P < 0.05) than other regions, and China 
experienced a larger increase in the rate of YLL from 1999 to 2004 (APC = 9.2, 
95% CI = 8.5, 9.9, P < 0.05) than other regions. LMCs experienced the largest 
changes in the DALY rate of AUD from 1990 to 2019 (AAPC = -0.9, 95% CI = -1.0, 
-0.8, P < 0.05), with a larger decline in 2006 to 2010 (APC = -3.3, 95% 
CI = -3.6, -2.9, P < 0.05) than other regions, and UMCs showed a larger increase 
in the rate of DALY from 1990 to 1994 (APC = 4.5, 95% CI = 3.8, 5.1, P < 0.05) 
than other regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the large variations in AUD burden of disease by income 
level, future strategies to prevent and reduce the burden should be developed 
and implemented based on country-specific development status.

During the last few decades, income inequality in emerging Asian economies has 
been increased dramatically. It is widely recognized that income inequality has 
severely impacted population health. This study attempts to estimate the impact 
of income inequality on health outcomes in emerging Asian economies for a time 
horizon ranging from 1991 to 2019. Our empirical analysis shows that income 
inequality has a negative effect on life expectancy in the long run. We also 
find that positive changes in income inequality decrease life expectancy, but a 
negative change in income inequality increases life expectancy in the long run 
in emerging Asian economies. The symmetric and asymmetric results are robust to 
different measures of econometric methods. Thus, governments should pay more 
attention to the consequences of their economic policies on income inequality to 
improve health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Deficits in knee strength after anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction (ACLR) surgery are common. Deficits in the single-leg drop jump 
(SLDJ), a test of plyometric ability, are also found.
PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between isokinetic knee strength, SLDJ 
performance, and self-reported knee function 9 months after ACLR.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Knee isokinetic peak torque, SLDJ jump height, contact time, and 
reactive strength index (RSI), as well as International Knee Documentation 
Committee (IKDC) scores were assessed in 116 male, field-sport athletes at 9.2 
months after ACLR. SLDJ testing took place in a 3-dimensional biomechanics 
laboratory. Linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship 
between the variables.
RESULTS: A significant relationship was found between ACLR-limb isokinetic knee 
extensor strength and SLDJ jump height (P < .001, r 2 = 0.29) and RSI (P < .001, 
r 2 = 0.33), and between ACLR-limb isokinetic knee flexor strength and SLDJ jump 
height (P < .001, r 2 = 0.12) and RSI (P < .001, r 2 = 0.15). A significant 
positive relationship was also found between knee extensor asymmetry and SLDJ 
jump height asymmetry (P < .001, r 2 = 0.27) and SLDJ reactive strength 
asymmetry (P < .001, r 2 = 0.18). Combined ACLR-limb jump height and contact 
time best predicted IKDC scores (P < .001, r 2 = 0.12).
CONCLUSION: Isokinetic knee extension strength explained approximately 30% of 
SLDJ performance, with a much weaker relationship between knee flexion strength 
and SLDJ performance. Isokinetic strength and SLDJ performance were weak 
predictors of variation in IKDC scores.

BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD) long-term motor outcomes of subthalamic 
nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) are well documented, while 
comprehensive reports on non-motor outcomes are fewer and less consistent.
OBJECTIVE: To report motor and non-motor symptoms after 5-years of STN-DBS.
METHODS: We performed an open 5-year extension study of a randomized trial that 
compared intraoperative verification versus mapping of STN using microelectrode 
recordings. Changes from preoperative to 5-years of STN-DBS were evaluated for 
motor and non-motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS I-IV), sleep disturbances (PDSS), 
autonomic symptoms (Scopa-Aut), quality of life (PDQ-39) and cognition through a 
neuropsychological test battery. We evaluated whether any differences between 
the two randomization groups were still present, and assessed preoperative 
predictors of physical dependence after 5 years of treatment using logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: We found lasting improvement of off-medication motor symptoms (total 
MDS-UPDRS III, bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and tremor), on-medication tremor, 
motor fluctuations, and sleep disturbances, but reduced performance across all 
cognitive domains, except verbal memory. Reduction of verbal fluency and 
executive function was most pronounced the first year and may thus be more 
directly related to the surgery than worsening in other domains. The group 
mapped with multiple microelectrode recordings had more improvement of 
bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and of PDQ-39 bodily discomfort sub-score, but also 
more reduction in word fluency. Older age was the most important factor 
associated with physical dependence after 5 years.
CONCLUSION: STN-DBS offers good long-term effects, including improved sleep, 
despite disease progression. STN-DBS surgery may negatively impact verbal 
fluency and executive function.

Tuning the Biointerface: Low-Temperature Surface Modification Strategies for 
Orthopedic Implants to Enhance Osteogenic and Antimicrobial Activity.

As both the average life expectancy and incidence of bone tissue reconstruction 
increases, development of load-bearing implantable materials that simultaneously 
enhance osseointegration while preventing postoperative infection is crucial. To 
address this need, significant research efforts have been dedicated to 
developing surface modification strategies for metallic load-bearing implants 
and scaffolds. Despite the abundance of strategies reported, many address only 
one factor, for example, surface chemistry or topography. Furthermore, the 
incorporation of surface features to increase osteocompatibility can increase 
the probability of infection, by encouraging the formation of bacterial 
biofilms. To truly advance this field, research efforts must focus on developing 
multifunctional coatings that concurrently address these complex and competing 
requirements. In addition, particular emphasis should be placed on utilizing 
surface modification processes that are versatile, low cost, and scalable, for 
ease of translation to mass manufacturing and clinical use. The aim of this 
short Review is to highlight recent advances in scalable and multifunctional 
surface modification techniques that obtain a programmed response at the bone 
tissue/implant interface. Low-temperature approaches based on macromolecule 
immobilization, electrochemical techniques, and solution processes are 
discussed. Although the strategies discussed in this Review have not yet been 
approved for clinical use, they show great promise toward developing the next 
generation of ultra-long-lasting biomaterials for joint and bone tissue repair.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the treatment and long-term outcomes of patients with 
acromegaly from all healthcare regions in Sweden.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of prospectively reported data from the Swedish 
Pituitary Register of 698 patients (51% females) with acromegaly diagnosed from 
1991 to 2011. The latest clinical follow-up date was December 2012, while 
mortality data were collected for 28.5 years until June 2019.
RESULTS: The annual incidence was 3.7/million; 71% of patients had a 
macroadenoma, 18% had visual field defects, and 25% had at least one pituitary 
hormone deficiency. Eighty-two percent had pituitary surgery, 10% radiotherapy, 
and 39% medical treatment. At the 5- and 10-year follow-ups, insulin-like growth 
factor 1 levels were within the reference range in 69 and 78% of patients, 
respectively. In linear regression, the proportion of patients with biochemical 
control including adjuvant therapy at 10 years follow-up increased over time by 
1.23% per year. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (95% CI) for all patients 
was 1.29 (1.11-1.49). For patients with biochemical control at the latest 
follow-up, SMR was not increased, neither among patients diagnosed between 1991 
and 2000, SMR: 1.06 (0.85-1.33) nor between 2001 and2011, SMR: 0.87 (0.61-1.24). 
In contrast, non-controlled patients at the latest follow-up from both decades 
had elevated SMR, 1.90 (1.33-2.72) and 1.98 (1.24-3.14), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with biochemical control increased over 
time. Patients with biochemically controlled acromegaly have normal life 
expectancy, while non-controlled patients still have increased mortality. The 
high rate of macroadenomas and unchanged age at diagnosis illustrates the need 
for improvements in the management of patients with acromegaly.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Decompensation is a hallmark of disease progression in 
cirrhotic patients. Early detection of a phase transition from compensated 
cirrhosis to decompensation would enable targeted therapeutic interventions 
potentially extending life expectancy. This study aims to (a) identify the 
predictors of decompensation in a large, multicentric cohort of patients with 
compensated cirrhosis, (b) to build a reliable prognostic score for 
decompensation and (c) to evaluate the score in independent cohorts.
METHODS: Decompensation was identified in electronic health records data from 
6049 cirrhosis patients in the IBM Explorys database training cohort by 
diagnostic codes for variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, ascites, hepato-renal 
syndrome and/or jaundice. We identified predictors of clinical decompensation 
and developed a prognostic score using Cox regression analysis. The score was 
evaluated using the IBM Explorys database validation cohort (N = 17662), the 
Penn Medicine BioBank (N = 1326) and the UK Biobank (N = 317).
RESULTS: The new Early Prediction of Decompensation (EPOD) score uses platelet 
count, albumin, and bilirubin concentration. It predicts decompensation during a 
3-year follow-up in three validation cohorts with AUROCs of 0.69, 0.69 and 0.77, 
respectively, and outperforms the well-known MELD and Child-Pugh score in 
predicting decompensation. Furthermore, the EPOD score predicted the 3-year 
probability of decompensation.
CONCLUSIONS: The EPOD score provides a prediction tool for the risk of 
decompensation in patients with cirrhosis that outperforms well-known cirrhosis 
scores. Since EPOD is based on three blood parameters, only, it provides maximal 
clinical feasibility at minimal costs.

Background: For hospitalized patients with palliative care needs, there is 
little evidence on whether postdischarge outcomes differ if inpatient palliative 
care was delivered by a palliative care specialist or nonspecialist/generalist. 
Objective: To evaluate relationships between inpatient palliative care 
involvement and physician-delivered palliative care in the community after 
hospital discharge among individuals with limited life expectancy. Design: 
Population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health data. 
Settings/Subjects: Adults with a predicted median survival of six months or less 
admitted to acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2013, and 
March 31, 2017, and discharged to the community. Measurements: Inpatient 
palliative care involvement was classified as high (e.g., palliative care unit), 
medium (e.g., palliative care specialist consult), low (e.g., 
generalist-delivered palliative care), or none. Community palliative care 
included outpatient and home and clinic visits three weeks postdischarge. 
Results: Among 3660 hospitalized adults, 82 (2.2%) received inpatient palliative 
care with high level of involvement, 462 (12.6%) with medium level of 
involvement, 525 (14.3%) with low level of involvement, and 2591 (70.8%) had no 
inpatient palliative care. Patients who received inpatient palliative care were 
more likely to receive community palliative care after discharge than those who 
received no inpatient palliative care. These associations were stronger among 
patients who received high/medium palliative care involvement than patients who 
received low palliative care involvement. Conclusions: Inpatient palliative 
care, including that delivered by generalists, is associated with an increased 
likelihood of community palliative care after discharge. Increased inpatient 
generalist palliative care may help support patients' palliative care needs.

The ever-increasing rise in the global population coupled with rapid 
urbanization demands considerable consumption of fossil fuel, food, and water. 
This in turn leads to energy depletion, greenhouse gas emissions and wet wastes 
generation (including food waste, animal manure, and sewage sludge). Conversion 
of the wet wastes to bioenergy and biochar is a promising approach to mitigate 
wastes, emissions and energy depletion, and simultaneously promotes 
sustainability and circular economy. In this study, various conversion 
technologies for transformation of wet wastes to bioenergy and biochar, 
including anaerobic digestion, gasification, incineration, hydrothermal 
carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, slow and fast pyrolysis, are 
comprehensively reviewed. The technological challenges impeding the widespread 
adoption of these wet waste conversion technologies are critically examined. 
Eventually, the study presents insightful recommendations for the technological 
advancements and wider acceptance of these processes by establishing a hierarchy 
of factors dictating their performance. These include: i) life-cycle assessment 
of these conversion technologies with the consideration of reactor design and 
catalyst utilization from lab to plant level; ii) process intensification by 
integrating one or more of the wet waste conversion technologies for improved 
performance and sustainability; and iii) emerging machine learning modeling is a 
promising strategy to aid the product characterization and optimization of 
system design for the specific to the bioenergy or biochar application.

Yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) is commonly contaminated by protease 
inhibitors because of the illegal use of antiviral drugs in aquaculture, so the 
determination of antiviral drugs is essential in food safety supervision. In 
this study, a novel sorbent, graphene and silica nanospheres composite 
(G/KCC-1), was synthesized for pipette-tip-based solid-phase extraction (PT-SPE) 
and purification of ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir in yellow catfish, 
followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The wrinkly structure of G/KCC-1 with center-radial 
nanowrinkles enlarged the surface area and increased the capacity of absorbing 
the target analyte. With the proposed G/KCC-1 based PT-SPE UPLC-MS/MS method, 
the pH of sample solution, aspirating/dispensing cycles for extraction and 
elution were optimized to be 4.0, 25, and 10 respectively, and the eluting 
solvent was methanol/ammonia (95:5, v/v) with 0.02 M sodium chloride. This new 
method was further validated to be linear (correlation coefficient R2, 
0.9993-0.9996), sensitive (limit of detection, LOD ≤ 0.8 ng mL-1), accurate 
(89.3-114.2%), and precise (relative standard deviation, RSD ≤ 6.23%). These 
results indicated that the proposed method is qualified in bioanalytical method 
validation and meets the requirements for detecting illegally used antiviral 
drugs in yellow catfish. The demonstrated G/KCC-1 based PT-SPE UPLC-MS/MS method 
is a potential analytical method in food and drug administration.

In classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), immunoediting via protein signaling is key 
to evading tumor surveillance. We aimed to identify immune-related proteins that 
distinguish diagnostic cHL tissues (=diagnostic tumor lysates, n = 27) from 
control tissues (reactive lymph node lysates, n = 30). Further, we correlated 
our findings with the proteome plasma profile between cHL patients (n = 26) and 
healthy controls (n = 27). We used the proximity extension assay (PEA) with the 
OlinkTM multiplex Immuno-Oncology panel, consisting of 92 proteins. Univariate, 
multivariate-adjusted analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's false discovery testing 
(=Padj) were performed to detect significant discrepancies. Proteins 
distinguishing cHL cases from controls were more numerous in plasma (30 
proteins) than tissue (17 proteins), all Padj < 0.05. Eight of the identified 
proteins in cHL tissue (PD-L1, IL-6, CCL17, CCL3, IL-13, MMP12, TNFRS4, and 
LAG3) were elevated in both cHL tissues and cHL plasma compared with control 
samples. Six proteins distinguishing cHL tissues from controls tissues were 
significantly correlated to PD-L1 expression in cHL tissue (IL-6, MCP-2, CCL3, 
CCL4, GZMB, and IFN-gamma, all p ≤0.05). In conclusion, this study introduces a 
distinguishing proteomic profile in cHL tissue and potential immune-related 
markers of pathophysiological relevance.
