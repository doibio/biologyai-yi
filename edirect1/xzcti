RESULTS: Of 204 studies screened, 11 studies met inclusion criteria, 
representing 31,439 SCS patients and 299,182 CT patients. The mean age was 53.5 
years for SCS and 55.6 years for CT. In eight of 11 studies, SCS was associated 
with favorable outcomes and found to be more cost-effective than CT for chronic 
low back pain. Compared with CT, SCS resulted in shorter hospital stays and 
lower complication rates and health care costs at 90 days. SCS was associated 
with significant improvement in health-related quality of life, health status, 
and quality-adjusted life-years.
CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of chronic low back and leg pain, the majority of 
studies are of fair quality, with level 3 or 4 evidence in support of SCS as 
potentially more cost-effective than CT, with less resource expenditure but 
higher complication rates. SCS therapy may yet play a role in mitigating the 
financial burden associated with chronic low back and leg pain.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive inherited 
haemoglobinopathy which causes painful vaso-occlusive crises due to sickle red 
blood cell dehydration. Vaso-occlusive crises are common painful events 
responsible for a variety of clinical complications; overall mortality is 
increased and life expectancy decreased compared to the general population. 
Experimental studies suggest that intravenous magnesium has proven to be 
well-tolerated in individuals hospitalised for the immediate relief of acute 
(sudden onset) painful crisis and has the potential to decrease the length of 
hospital stay. Some in vitro studies and open studies of long-term oral 
magnesium showed promising effect on pain relief but failed to show its 
efficacy. The studies show that oral magnesium therapy may prevent sickle red 
blood cell dehydration and prevent recurrent painful episodes. There is a need 
to access evidence for the impact of oral and intravenous magnesium effect on 
frequency of pain, length of hospital stay and quality of life. This is an 
updated version of the review.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of short-term intravenous magnesium on the 
length of hospital stay and quality of life in children and adults with sickle 
cell disease. To determine the effects of long-term oral magnesium therapy on 
the frequency of painful crises and the quality of life in children and adults 
with sickle cell disease.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books.Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis 
and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 03 February 
2019.Date of last search of other resources (clinical trials registries): 04 
April 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for published and unpublished randomized 
controlled studies of oral or intravenous magnesium compared to placebo or no 
magnesium.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed the study quality 
and extracted the data using standard Cochrane methodologies.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five randomized placebo-controlled studies with a 
total of 386 participants (aged three to 53 years). Of these, two shorter 
parallel studies (n = 306) compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo 
(normal saline) for admission to hospital due to a vaso-occlusive crisis, for 
which we were able to analyse data. The quality of evidence was moderate for 
studies in this comparison, mainly due to limitations due to risk of bias and 
imprecision. Two of the three longer-term studies comparing oral magnesium 
pidolate to placebo had a cross-over design. The third was a parallel factorial 
study which compared hydroxyurea and oral magnesium to each other and to placebo 
over a longer period of time; we only present the comparison of oral magnesium 
to placebo from this study. The quality of evidence was very low with 
uncertainty of the estimation.The eight-hourly dose levels in the two studies of 
intravenous magnesium were different; one used 100 mg/kg while the second used 
40 mg/kg. Only one of these studies (n = 104) reported the mean daily pain score 
while hospitalised (a non-significant difference between groups, moderate 
quality evidence). The second study (n = 202) reported a number of child- and 
parent-reported quality of life scores. None of the scores showed any difference 
between treatment groups (low quality evidence). Data from one study (n = 106) 
showed no difference in length of stay in hospital between groups (low quality 
evidence). Both studies reported on adverse events, but not defined by severity 
as we had planned. One study showed significantly more participants receiving 
intravenous magnesium experienced warmth at infusion site compared to placebo; 
there were no differences between groups for other adverse events (low quality 
evidence).Three studies (n = 80) compared oral magnesium pidolate to placebo. 
None of them reported data which we were able to analyse. One study (n = 24) 
reported on the number of painful days and stated there was no difference 
between two groups (low quality evidence). None of the studies reported on 
quality of life or length of hospital stay. Two studies (n = 68) reported there 
were no differences in levels of magnesium in either plasma or red blood cells 
(moderate quality evidence). Two studies (n = 56) reported adverse events. One 
reported episodes of mild diarrhoea and headache, all of which resolved without 
stopping treatment. The second study reported adverse events as gastrointestinal 
disorders, headache or migraine, upper respiratory infections and rash; which 
were all evenly distributed across treatment groups (moderate quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to low quality evidence showed neither 
intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium therapy has an effect on reducing 
painful crisis, length of hospital stay and changing quality of life in treating 
sickle cell disease. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding 
its clinical benefit. Further randomized controlled studies, perhaps 
multicentre, are necessary to establish whether intravenous and oral magnesium 
therapies have any effect on improving the health of people with sickle cell 
disease.

Transvaginal US of Endometriosis: Looking Beyond the Endometrioma with a 
Dedicated Protocol.

Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is a valuable primary imaging tool for the initial 
evaluation and management of endometriosis, a complex multifocal disease process 
with a varied spectrum of clinical and morphologic features that can 
substantially affect quality of life. The high accuracy of TVS for the detailed 
mapping of disease extent, an essential process for guiding treatment 
strategies, is well documented. The dynamic nature of US provides added value, 
revealing information that is not easily addressed with other imaging 
modalities. As recognized by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis 
Consensus Group, a dedicated standardized protocol that is used by experienced 
and knowledgeable operators is necessary for a complete evaluation. The four 
components of a dedicated TVS protocol for evaluation of pelvic endometriosis 
are (a) evaluation of the uterus and adnexa, (b) dedicated search for deep 
infiltrating endometriosis, (c) assessment of the sliding sign, and (d) 
detection of sonographic soft markers. These components are described, and the 
multiple locations and US findings of endometriosis within the pelvis are 
reviewed, with emphasis on the unique features of US as an extension of the 
physical examination. In addition to enabling evaluation of the static findings 
of adenomyosis, endometrioma, hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx, and hypoechoic 
nodules of deep infiltrating endometriosis, dynamic TVS enables assessment of 
pouch of Douglas obliteration, organ mobility, and site-specific tenderness, as 
well as tenderness-guided imaging. The benefits of implementing a dedicated TVS 
protocol in terms of improved patient care are also discussed. Online 
supplemental material is available for this article. ©RSNA, 2019.

BACKGROUND: Effective and cost-effective primary care treatments for low back 
pain (LBP) are required to reduce the burden of the world's most disabling 
condition. This study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach to LBP 
(intervention) with usual general practitioner (GP) care (control).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial with 
process evaluation and parallel economic evaluation was conducted in the Hutt 
Valley, New Zealand. Eight general practices were randomly assigned (stratified 
by practice size) with a 1:1 ratio to intervention (4 practices; 34 GPs) or 
control group (4 practices; 29 GPs). Adults presenting to these GPs with LBP as 
their primary complaint were recruited. GPs in the intervention practices were 
trained in the FREE approach, and patients presenting to these practices 
received care based on the FREE approach. The FREE approach restructures LBP 
consultations to prioritise early identification and management of barriers to 
recovery. GPs in control practices did not receive specific training for this 
study, and patients presenting to these practices received usual care. Between 
23 September 2016 and 31 July 2017, 140 eligible patients presented to 
intervention practices (126 enrolled) and 110 eligible patients presented to 
control practices (100 enrolled). Patient mean age was 46.1 years (SD 14.4), and 
46% were female. The duration of LBP was less than 6 weeks in 88% of patients. 
Primary outcome was change from baseline in patient participant Roland Morris 
Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 6 months. Secondary patient outcomes 
included pain, satisfaction, and psychosocial indices. GP outcomes included 
attitudes, knowledge, confidence, and GP LBP management behaviour. There was 
active and passive surveillance of potential harms. Patients and outcome 
assessors were blind to group assignment. Analysis followed intention-to-treat 
principles. A total of 122 (97%) patients from 32 GPs in the intervention group 
and 99 (99%) patients from 25 GPs in the control group were included in the 
primary outcome analysis. At 6 months, the groups did not significantly differ 
on the primary outcome (adjusted mean RMDQ score difference 0.57, 95% CI -0.64 
to 1.78; p = 0.354) or secondary patient outcomes. The RMDQ difference met the 
predefined criterion to indicate noninferiority. One control group participant 
experienced an activity-related gluteal tear, with no other adverse events 
recorded. Intervention group GPs had improvements in attitudes, knowledge, and 
confidence compared with control group GPs. Intervention group GP LBP management 
behaviour became more guideline concordant than the control group. In 
cost-effectiveness, the intervention dominated control with lower costs and 
higher Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains. Limitations of this study were 
that although adequately powered for primary outcome assessment, the study was 
not powered for evaluating some employment, healthcare use, and economic 
outcomes. It was also not possible for research nurses (responsible for patient 
recruitment) to be masked on group allocation for practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that the FREE approach improves GP 
concordance with LBP guideline recommendations but does not improve patient 
recovery outcomes compared with usual care. The FREE approach may reduce 
unnecessary healthcare use and produce economic benefits. Work participation or 
health resource use should be considered for primary outcome assessment in 
future trials of undifferentiated LBP.

BACKGROUND: Surgical disease increasingly contributes to global mortality and 
morbidity. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery found that global 
cost-effectiveness data are lacking for a wide range of essential surgical 
procedures. This study helps to address this gap by defining the 
cost-effectiveness of exploratory laparotomies in a regional referral hospital 
in Uganda.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A time-and-motion analysis was utilized to calculate 
operating theater personnel costs per case. Ward personnel, administrative, 
medication, and supply costs were recorded and calculated using a microcosting 
approach. The cost in 2018 US Dollars (USD, $) per disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) averted was calculated based on age-specific life expectancies for 
otherwise fatal cases.
RESULTS: Data for 103 surgical patients requiring exploratory laparotomy at the 
Soroti Regional Referral Hospital were collected over 8 mo. The most common 
cause for laparotomy was small bowel obstruction (32% of total cases). The 
average cost per patient was $75.50. The postoperative mortality was 11.7%, and 
7.8% of patients had complications. The average number of DALYs averted per 
patient was 18.51. The cost in USD per DALY averted was $4.08.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides evidence that exploratory laparotomy is 
cost-effective compared with other public health interventions. Relative 
cost-effectiveness includes a comparison with bed nets for malaria prevention 
($6.48-22.04/DALY averted), tuberculosis, tetanus, measles, and polio vaccines 
($12.96-25.93/DALY averted), and HIV treatment with multidrug antiretroviral 
therapy ($453.74-648.20/DALY averted). Given that the total burden of surgically 
treatable conditions in DALYs is more than that of malaria, tuberculosis, and 
HIV combined, our findings strengthen the argument for greater investment in 
primary surgical capacity in low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: The large observed variability in hemophilia prevalence prevents 
robust estimation of burden of disease.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and prevalence at birth of hemophilia and 
the associated life expectancy disadvantage.
DESIGN: Random-effects meta-analysis of registry data.
SETTING: Australia, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Male patients with hemophilia A or B.
MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of hemophilia as a proportion of cases to the male 
population, prevalence of hemophilia at birth as a proportion of cases to live 
male births by year of birth, life expectancy disadvantage as a 1 - ratio of 
prevalence to prevalence at birth, and expected number of patients worldwide 
based on prevalence in high-income countries and prevalence at birth.
RESULTS: Prevalence (per 100 000 males) is 17.1 cases for all severities of 
hemophilia A, 6.0 cases for severe hemophilia A, 3.8 cases for all severities of 
hemophilia B, and 1.1 cases for severe hemophilia B. Prevalence at birth (per 
100 000 males) is 24.6 cases for all severities of hemophilia A, 9.5 cases for 
severe hemophilia A, 5.0 cases for all severities of hemophilia B, and 1.5 cases 
for severe hemophilia B. The life expectancy disadvantage for high-income 
countries is 30% for hemophilia A, 37% for severe hemophilia A, 24% for 
hemophilia B, and 27% for severe hemophilia B. The expected number of patients 
with hemophilia worldwide is 1 125 000, of whom 418 000 should have severe 
hemophilia.
LIMITATION: Details were insufficient to adjust for comorbid conditions and 
ethnicity.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hemophilia is higher than previously estimated. 
Patients with hemophilia still have a life expectancy disadvantage. Establishing 
prevalence at birth is a milestone toward assessing years of life lost, years of 
life with disability, and burden of disease.

BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in staging 
gastro-oesophageal cancers (GOCs) has been widely studied. However, the economic 
evidence of EUS staging in the management of patients with GOCs is scarce. This 
review aimed to examine all economic evidence (not limited to randomised 
controlled trials) of the use of EUS staging in the management of GOCs patients, 
and to offer a review of economic evidence on the costs, benefits (in terms of 
GOCs patients' health-related quality of life), and economic implications of the 
use of EUS in staging GOCs patients.
METHODS: The protocol was registered prospectively with PROSPERO 
(CRD42016043700; 
http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42016043700 ). 
MEDLINE (ovid), EMBASE (ovid), The Cochrane Collaboration Register and Library 
(including the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), 
CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Web of Science (Core Collection) as well as reference 
lists were systematically searched for studies conducted between 1996 and 2018 
(search update 28/04/2018). Two authors independently screened the identified 
articles, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Study characteristics of 
the included articles, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, when 
available, were summarised narratively.
RESULTS: Of the 197 articles retrieved, six studies met the inclusion criteria: 
three economic studies and three economic modelling studies. Of the three 
economic studies, one was a cost-effectiveness analysis and two were cost 
analyses. Of the three economic modelling studies, one was a cost-effectiveness 
analysis and two were cost-minimisation analyses. Both of the cost-effectiveness 
analyses reported that use of EUS as an additional staging technique provided, 
on average, more QALYs (0.0019-0.1969 more QALYs) and saved costs (by 
£1969-£3364 per patient, 2017 price year) compared to staging strategy without 
EUS. Of the six studies, only one included GOCs participants and the other five 
included oesophageal cancer participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The data available suggest use of EUS as a complementary staging 
technique to other staging techniques for GOCs appears to be cost saving and 
offers greater QALYs. Nevertheless, future studies are necessary because the 
economic evidence around this EUS staging intervention for GOCs is far from 
robust. More health economic research and good quality data are needed to judge 
the economic benefits of EUS staging for GOCs.

BACKGROUND: With the increase of overall life expectancy in Japan, effective and 
beneficial lifestyle approaches and practices are crucial for individuals to 
have a long, productive and healthy life. Although previous studies suggest that 
exercise or sports, especially when performed with others, from midlife level 
have a positive impact on enhancing healthy life expectancy, there is paucity of 
information regarding these contexts and possible associations. The present 
study intends to clarify the relationship between engagement in exercise or 
sports among middle-aged persons and healthy life expectancy through an 
ecological study in all prefectures in Japan.
METHODS: We tabulated (1) the ratios of middle-aged individuals engaged in 
exercise or sports and (2) the different methods by which they are engaged in 
exercise or sports for each prefecture by using data from the 2005-2010 
Longitudinal Survey of Middle-aged and Elderly Persons by the Ministry of 
Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. Weighted multiple linear regression 
analyses were performed by sex, using healthy life expectancy in 2010 of each 
prefecture calculated by Hashimoto (2013) as a criterion variable; indices of 
(1) and (2) of each year as explanatory variables; and age, living conditions, 
employment, and chronic diseases as adjusted variables.
RESULTS: For middle-aged males, the ratio of those engaged in exercise or sports 
in each year from 2005 to 2010 was positively correlated with healthy life 
expectancy; this relationship was found in the ratio of middle-aged engaging in 
exercise or sports "with families or friends". For females, such a relationship 
could only be found in the ratio of middle-aged females engaged in exercise or 
sports in 2008 and 2010, and those engaging in exercise or sports "with families 
or friends" in 2008.
CONCLUSION: Prefectures with a higher ratio of middle-aged individuals engaging 
in exercise or sports, especially when done with families or friends, have 
longer healthy life expectancies. This was particularly evident for males. Thus, 
exercise or sports with families or friends in midlife seems to be more 
effective in promoting healthy life expectancy for males than females in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Sternal wound complications (SWC) are a rare but potentially 
life-threatening complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
surgery. Especially the use of bilateral IMA (BIMA) grafts as opposed to single 
IMA (SIMA) grafts is associated with an increased risk of SWC. Skeletonised 
harvesting has been proposed to reduce this risk. The purpose of this study was 
to retrospectively investigate the effect of skeletonisation on SWC after 
off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) in a centre with a high volume 
of off-pump procedures and high frequencies of BIMA.
METHODS: From January 2010 to November 2016, 1900 consecutive patients underwent 
OPCAB surgery at the University Hospitals of Leuven. The first group (n = 1487) 
received non-skeletonised IMA grafts, whereas the second group (n = 413) 
received skeletonised grafts. Optimal wound management was pursued in all 
patients. A new four-grade classification for SWC was developed. Incidence and 
grade of SWC as well as overall survival were assessed.
RESULTS: Analysis of diabetic patients showed a lower incidence of SWC in the 
skeletonised (12/141, 8.5%) compared to the non-skeletonised group (82/414, 
19.8%) [odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval (0.23;0.88), p = 0.019] as well 
as a lower grade [0.45 (0.24;0.871), p = 0.018]. There was no significant effect 
on overall survival [0.67 (0.19;2.32), p = 0.529]. Subanalysis of this 
population revealed that the observed effects were most prominent in patients 
receiving BIMA grafts, with 6/56 (10.7%) SWC in the skeletonised and 62/252 
(24.6%) in the non-skeletonised group [0.37 (0.15;0.90), p = 0.028 for 
incidence], as well as a lower grade [0.36 (0.15;0.88), p = 0.025]. These 
advantages were not significant in diabetic patients receiving SIMA grafts nor 
in the full study population.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, using a more sensitive classification of SWC, shows in 
a large group of patients that, in combination with optimized wound management, 
the skeletonisation technique is associated with a clear reduction in the 
incidence and grade of SWC in diabetic patients receiving BIMA grafts. This 
encourages the extension of BIMA use in OPCAB to this risk population.

Life expectancy in the United States has increased due to advances in health 
care. Despite increased utilization of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 
octogenarian patients are less likely to be referred to the catheterization 
laboratory for coronary interventions. This is in part due to multiple patient 
co-morbidities and lack of established guidelines. We examined in-hospital 
clinical outcomes of octogenarian and nonoctogenarian patients who underwent PCI 
in the United States. Using the National Inpatient Sampling database, we 
identified all adult patients who are older than 18 years and underwent PCI. 
Patient were stratified by age into 2 groups, ≥80 years old and <80 years old 
and in-hospital adverse outcome rates were determined. A total of 11,056,559 
patients underwent PCI between the years of 2002 and 2014 and 1,544,563 patients 
were ≥80 years old (14%). After multivariable adjustment, patients who are ≥80 
years old had higher in-hospital mortality (3.3% vs 1.3%, adjusted Odds Ratio, 
1.624; 95% confidence interval, 1.602 to 1.647, p <0.0001) and longer length of 
stay (median length of stay days 3, range 2 to 8 days vs median 2 days, range 1 
to 4 days) (p <0.0001). Patients ≥80 years old had a higher rate of 
cardiopulmonary complications, postprocedural stroke, acute kidney injury, 
postprocedural thromboembolic complications, and hemorrhage requiring 
transfusion. There was no difference in vascular complications between the 2 
groups. In conclusion, octogenarians who underwent PCI were at increased risk 
for in-hospital mortality and morbidity compared with nonoctogenarians. The 
decision to proceed with PCI in this patient population should be 
individualized, taking into consideration known risk factors and patient's 
wishes.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a rapidly spreading chronic disease worldwide. Long-term 
results are critical to assess the effectiveness of a bariatric procedure, 
particularly in young patients who have long life expectancy.
METHODS: A retrospective study on adolescents with morbid obesity who underwent 
Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (LAGB) at our institute from 1995 to 
2018 was made. Primary endpoints were efficacy, in term of weight loss and 
comorbidity resolution, occurrence of complications and reoperations.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients underwent LAGB between 1995 and 2018. Intra- and 
post-operative mortality was absent. The patients' presence at follow-up at 5, 
10 and 15 years was 38/50 (76%), 18/25 (72%) and 5/8 (63%), respectively. At 
those times the mean excess weight loss percentage was 61.7 ± 29.4, 48.1 ± 50.4 
and 55.8 ± 51.2, respectively. Comorbidity resolution rates were 100% for 
patients with diabetes, 78% for patients with hypertension, 75% for joint pain 
suffers, 69% for patients with sleep apnea and 57% for patients with anxiety and 
depression. Total reoperation rate was 30.5%. The band was removed in 8 
patients: 3 due to erosions, 3 by patients' choice and 2 conversions to other 
bariatric procedures.
CONCLUSION: LAGB, in combination with the patients' close follow-up performed by 
an interdisciplinary team, can be an effective long-term surgical treatment for 
teenagers with morbid obesity.

OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies reported that achieving near-normal glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes may delay or even prevent 
vascular complications. However, information regarding the impact of non-optimal 
HbA1c control on adverse health outcomes in an Arab population is unknown. The 
aim of this study was to estimate the fraction of deaths and potential years of 
life lost (PYLL) attributable to non-optimal HbA1c control among Emirati men and 
women with diabetes in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study was conducted in outpatient clinics at a tertiary care 
centre in Al Ain, UAE, between April 2008 and September 2018.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample comprised of 583 adult UAE nationals, aged≥18 years, 
with diabetes. Overall, 57% (n=332) of the study participants were men and 43% 
(n=251) were women.
EXPOSURE: Non-optimal HbA1c control, defined as HbA1c≥6.5%.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality, defined as death from any cause.
RESULTS: At the end of the 9-year follow-up period, 86 (14.8%) participants 
died. Overall, up to 33% (95% CI 2% to 63%) of deaths were attributable to 
non-optimal HbA1c control among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Stratified 
by sex, the adjusted fraction of avoidable mortality was 17% (95% CI -23% to 
57%) for men and 50% (95% CI 3% to 98%) for women. Both deaths and PYLL 
attributable to non-optimal HbA1c control were higher in women compared with 
men.
CONCLUSIONS: Up to one-third of all deaths in adult UAE nationals with DM could 
be attributed to non-optimal HbA1c control. Effective sex-specific interventions 
and healthcare quality-improvement programmes should urgently be implemented.

We collected data on mortality of late-instar gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), 
from outbreak populations over 4 wk in June 2017 at 10 sites in the New England 
region of the United States, along with estimated rainfall at these sites. 
Deposition of airborne conidia of the fungal pathogen, Entomophaga maimaiga 
Humber, Shimazu & R.S. Soper, was measured at these same sites as well as at 
seven other locations in New England. We also quantified the geographical 
distribution of gypsy moth-caused defoliation in New England in 2017 and 2018 
from Landsat imagery. Weekly mortality of gypsy moth larvae caused by E. 
maimaiga correlated with local deposition of conidia from the previous week, but 
not with rainfall. Mortality from this pathogen reached a peak during the last 2 
wk of gypsy moth larval development and always exceeded that caused by LdNPV, 
the viral pathogen of gypsy moth that has long been associated with gypsy moth 
outbreaks, especially prior to 1989. Cotesia melanoscela (Ratzeburg) was by far 
the most abundant parasitoid recovered and caused an average of 12.6% cumulative 
parasitism, but varied widely among sites. Deposition of E. maimaiga conidia was 
highly correlated with percent land area defoliated by gypsy moths within 
distances of 1 and 2 km but was not significantly correlated with defoliation at 
distances greater than 2 km. This is the first study to relate deposition of 
airborne conidia of E. maimaiga to mortality of gypsy moths from that agent.

with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator explant in a high-income city of 
China.

INTRODUCTION: Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is recommended for 
patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removal. This study 
aimed to investigate the potential cost-effectiveness of WCD for patients with 
ICD explant in a high-income city of China.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 5-year decision-analytic model was developed to simulate 
outcomes of three strategies during the period between ICD explant and 
reimplantation: discharge-to-home without WCD (home group), discharge-to-home 
with WCD (WCD group), and stay-in-hospital (hospital group). Outcome measures 
were mortality rates (during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation), 
direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost 
per QALY saved (ICER). Model inputs were derived from literature and public 
data. Base-case analysis was performed at four cost levels of WCD. Robustness of 
model results was examined by sensitivity analyses. In base-case analysis, the 
8-week mortality rates of WCD, hospital, and home groups were 7.3%, 8.1%, and 
9.4%, respectively. WCD group gained the highest QALYs (3.0990 QALYs), followed 
by hospital group (3.0553 QALYs) and home group (3.0132 QALYs). The WCD group 
was the cost-effective option with ICERs less than willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold (57 315 USD/QALY) at WCD daily cost ≤USD48. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, the WCD group at daily cost of USD24, USD48, USD72, and 
USD96 were cost-effective in 100%, 94.16%, 22.08%, and 0.16% of 10 000 Monte 
Carlo simulations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of WCD during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation 
is likely to save life and gain higher QALYs. Cost-effectiveness of WCD is 
highly subject to the daily cost of WCD in China.

INTRODUCTION: Many patients at the end of their life are treated with multiple 
medications while some of the drugs may no longer be beneficial and should be 
reduced.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess polypharmacy, overprescribing, 
and the incidence of presumable pharmacological errors at referral to palliative 
care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Current treatment in consecutive patients was analyzed 
based on the clinical judgment of a palliative care specialist on the first 
appointment. The number of drugs/tablets with pharmacotherapy inappropriateness 
was counted, analyzed, and a new therapy was proposed.
RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were admitted. The median number of drugs / 
tablets used at referral was 7 / 9 per day. In patients with short life 
prognosis, the corresponding numbers were higher (8 / 10). Polypharmacy was 
found in 265 patients (78.6%) and at least 1 drug inappropriateness occurred in 
238 patients (70.6%). The most frequent error type was lack of necessary 
concomitant drug. Patients who were bed‑bound (Palliative Performance Scale ≤40 
points), with the shortest life expectancy (Gold Standards Framework, D), who 
died within 2 weeks or were discharged from the hospital and admitted to hospice 
had more often 1 or more potentially inappropriate medication. The risk of 
inappropriateness increased with the number of drugs / tablets prescribed by 
13.3% / 7.4% per drug / tablet. The median number of drugs / tablets decreased 
on palliative consultation by 1.0 / 2.0 (P = 0.01 / P <0.001, respectively). 
Subgroups with a higher number of errors had a larger drug reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy and increased risk of drug inappropriateness 
particularly affect elderly patients referred by hospitals, with poor prognosis, 
low performance, admitted to in‑patient hospice. Therapy reduction may diminish 
the risk of therapeutic inappropriateness but requires further education within 
nonspecialist palliative care.

Aims: Protocol T (NCT01627249) was a head-to-head study conducted by the 
Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network that compared intravitreal 
aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab for the treatment of diabetic macular 
edema (DME). A cost-effectiveness analysis accompanying the 1-year data of 
Protocol T revealed that aflibercept was not cost-effective vs ranibizumab for 
all patients, but could have been cost-effective in certain patient sub-groups 
if the 1-year results were extrapolated out to 10 years. The present study 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of US Food and Drug Administration-approved 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (ranibizumab, aflibercept) for 
treatment of DME using the 2-year data from Protocol T.Methods: Costs of 
aflibercept 2.0 mg or ranibizumab 0.3 mg, visual acuity (VA)-related medical 
costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were simulated for eight VA 
health states. Treatment, adverse event management, and VA-related healthcare 
resource costs (2016 US dollars) were based on Medicare reimbursement and 
published literature. VA-related health utilities were determined using a 
published algorithm. Patients were stratified by baseline VA: 20/40 or better; 
20/50 or worse.Results: Total 2-year costs were higher, and QALYs similar, for 
aflibercept vs ranibizumab in the full cohort ($44,423 vs $34,529; 1.476 vs 
1.466), 20/40 or better VA sub-group ($40,854 vs $31,897; 1.517 vs 1.519), and 
20/50 or worse VA sub-group ($48,214 vs $37,246; 1.433 vs 1.412), respectively. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the full cohort and 20/50 or worse VA 
sub-group were $986,159/QALY and $523,377/QALY, respectively. These decreased to 
$711,301 and $246,978 when analyses were extrapolated to 10 years.Limitations: 
Key potential limitations include the fact that VA was the only QALY parameter 
analyzed and the uncertainty surrounding the role of better- and worse-seeing 
eye VA in overall functional impairment.Conclusions: This analysis suggests that 
aflibercept is not cost-effective vs ranibizumab for patients with DME, 
regardless of baseline vision.

Background: Concerns about falls, or fear of falling, are frequently reported by 
older people and can have serious consequences. Aim of this study was to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a home-based, cognitive behavioral programme 
for independently-living, frail older people in comparison with usual care from 
a societal perspective. Methods: This economic evaluation was embedded in a 
randomized-controlled trial with a follow-up of 12-months. In the trial 389 
people aged 70 years or older were allocated to usual care (n = 195) or the 
intervention group (n = 194). The intervention group received a home-based, 
cognitive behavioral programme. Main outcome measures were concerns about falls 
and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Results: Average total costs per 
participant in the usual care group were 8,094 Euros and 7,890 Euros for 
participants in the intervention group. The intervention group showed a 
significant decrease in concerns about falls and a non-significant increase in 
QALYS in comparison with the usual care group. The probability that the 
intervention was cost-effective was 75% at a willingness to pay of 20,000 Euros 
per QALY. Discussion: The programme is likely to be cost-effective, and 
therefore a useful addition to current geriatric care, particularly for those 
persons who are not able or willing to attend group programmes. Trial 
registration: NCT01358032.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Due to continuous development of new drugs and better 
treatment strategies, survival of patients with cystic fibrosis has changed 
dramatically. Recently, targeted therapy of cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have become available. Despite these 
promising developments, treatment of this complex multiorgan disease constitutes 
a high and variable amount of other drugs. Complications of pharmacotherapeutic 
treatment are, therefore, expected to become more prevalent. This gives cause to 
review drug-related side effects in this new era in cystic fibrosis treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: We will discuss cystic fibrosis-related pharmacotherapies with 
a focus on indication of treatment, side effects and their complications, 
drug--drug interactions, and options to monitor and prevent drug-induced 
toxicity. Many recent publications about pharmacotherapy in cystic fibrosis, 
focus on antifungal therapy and CFTR modulators. We will give an overview of the 
most important studies.
SUMMARY: With increased life expectancy which is, in part, because of better 
treatment options, the burden of pharmacotherapy in cystic fibrosis patients 
will increase. This has a high impact on quality of life as pharmacotherapy is 
time consuming and may cause side effects. Therefore, it is very important to be 
aware of possible pharmacotherapy-related side effects and their complications, 
drug--drug interactions, and options to monitor and prevent drug-induced 
toxicity.
