Introduction. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is one of the major causes of pain 
and disability in the older population. Although exercise is an effective 
treatment for knee OA, there is lack of evidence regarding hip OA. The aim of 
this trial was to test the safety and feasibility of a specifically designed 
exercise program in relieving hip pain and improving function in hip OA 
participants and to evaluate various methods to measure changes in their 
physical functioning. Materials and Methods. 13 women aged ≥ 65 years with hip 
OA were recruited in this 12-week pilot study. Results. Pain declined 
significantly over 30% from baseline, and joint function and health-related 
quality of life improved slightly. Objective assessment of physical functioning 
showed statistically significant improvement in the maximal isometric leg 
extensor strength by 20% and in the hip extension range of motion by 30%. 
Conclusions. The exercise program was found to be safe and feasible. The present 
evidence indicates that the exercise program is effective in the short term. 
However, adequate powered RCTs are needed to determine effects of long-term 
exercise therapy on pain and progression of hip OA.

The Brazilian Cerrado area is in rapid decline because of the expansion of 
modern agriculture. In this study, we used extensive field data and a 30-year 
chronosequence of Landsat images (1980-2010) to assess the effects of time since 
conversion of Cerrado into agriculture upon soil chemical attributes and 
soybean/corn yield in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed. We determined the rates 
of vegetation conversion into agriculture, the agricultural land use time since 
conversion, and the temporal changes in topsoil (0-20 cm soil depth) and 
subsurface (20-40 cm) chemical attributes of the soils. In addition, we 
investigated possible associations between fertilization/over-fertilization and 
land use history detected from the satellites. The results showed that 61.8% of 
the native vegetation in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed was already converted 
into agriculture with 31% of soils being used in agriculture for more than 
30 years. While other fertilizers in cultivated soils (e.g., Ca+2, Mg+2, and P) 
have been compensated over time by soil management practices to keep crop yield 
high, large reductions in C org (38%) and N tot (29%) were observed in old 
cultivated areas. Furthermore, soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years 
of farming presented higher values of P and Mg+2 than the ideal levels necessary 
for plant development. Therefore, increased risks of over-fertilization of the 
soils and environmental contamination with these macronutrients were associated 
with soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming, especially 
those with more than 30 years of agricultural land use.

The choice of antiplatelet therapy among Asian populations for the treatment of 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is complicated owing to the high prevalence of 
cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genetic polymorphism that has been associated 
with reduced efficacy of clopidogrel. Ticagrelor is a potent but more expensive 
alternative antiplatelet agent that is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism. 
This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from the Hong Kong 
health-care provider's perspective, of CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided selection of 
antiplatelet therapy compared with the universal use of clopidogrel or 
ticagrelor among ACS patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI). In the present study, a two-part model consisting of a 1-year decision 
tree and a lifetime Markov model was built to simulate the progress of a typical 
cohort of 60-year-old Chinese patients until age 85 years and compare three 
treatment strategies: (i) generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor based on CYP2C19*2 
genotype, (ii) universal use of generic clopidogrel or (iii) universal use of 
ticagrelor for all patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of <1 
gross domestic product per capita locally (US dollar 
(USD)42 423/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) were considered cost-effective. 
Base-case results showed universal ticagrelor use was cost-effective compared 
with universal clopidogrel, but was dominated by genotype-guided treatment. 
Genotype-guided treatment was cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel 
use (ICER of USD2560/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that with the cost 
of genotype testing up to USD400, CYP2C19*2 genotype-guided antiplatelet 
treatment remained a cost-effective strategy compared with either universal use 
of generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor in post-PCI ACS patients in Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of radical hysterectomy (RH) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for the 
management of early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA2-IB1).
METHODS: A simple decision tree model was developed to follow a simulated cohort 
of patients with early-stage cervical cancer treated with RH and 1 of 3 lymph 
node assessment strategies: systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), SLNB 
using technetium 99 (Tc99) and blue dye, and SLNB using Tc99 only. SLNB using 
indocyanine green (ICG) was used as an exploratory strategy. Relevant studies 
were identified to extract the probability data and utility parameters and to 
estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and absolute life-years (ALYs). 
Only direct medical costs were modeled, and the time horizon for the study was 5 
years.
RESULTS: SLNB using Tc99 and blue dye cost $21,089 and yielded 4.54 QALYs and 
4.90 ALYs. PLND cost $22,353 and yielded 4.47 QALYs and 4.91 ALYs. SLNB using 
blue dye and Tc99 was the most cost-effective strategy when ALYs were considered 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $144,531. When QALYs were 
considered, the SLNB technique using Tc99 and blue dye dominated all other 
strategies. SLNB using ICG cost $20,624 and yielded 4.90 ALYs and 4.54 QALYs. It 
was clinically superior to and less expensive than all other strategies when 
QALYs were the outcome of interest and had an ICER of $221,171 per ALY in 
comparison with RH plus PLND.
CONCLUSIONS: SLNB using Tc99 and blue dye with ultrastaging is considered the 
most cost-effective strategy with respect to 5-year progression-free survival 
and morbidity-free survival. Although it was included only as an exploratory 
strategy in this study, SLNB with ICG has the potential to be the most 
cost-effective strategy. Cancer 2017;123:1751-1759. © 2017 American Cancer

For identification of clinically relevant masses to predict status, grade, 
relapse and prognosis of colorectal cancer, we applied Matrix-assisted laser 
desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to a tissue micro 
array containing formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 349 
patients. Analysis of our MALDI-IMS data revealed 27 different m/z signals 
associated with epithelial structures. Comparison of these signals showed 
significant association with status, grade and Ki-67 labeling index. Fifteen out 
of 27 IMS signals revealed a significant association with survival. For seven 
signals (m/z 654, 776, 788, 904, 944, 975 and 1013) the absence and for eight 
signals (m/z 643, 678, 836, 886, 898, 1095, 1459 and 1477) the presence were 
associated with decreased life expectancy, including five masses (m/z 788, 836, 
904, 944 and 1013) that provided prognostic information independently from the 
established prognosticators pT and pN. Combination of these five masses resulted 
in a three-step classifier that provided prognostic information superior to 
univariate analysis. In addition, a total of 19 masses were associated with 
tumor stage, grade, metastasis and cell proliferation. Our data demonstrate the 
suitability of combining IMS and large-scale tissue micro arrays to 
simultaneously identify and validate clinically useful molecular marker.

Achieving efficient nonenzymatic replication of RNA is an important step toward 
the synthesis of self-replicating protocells that may mimic early forms of life. 
Despite recent progress, the nonenzymatic copying of templates containing mixed 
sequences remains slow and inefficient. Here we demonstrate that activating 
nucleotides with 2-aminoimidazole results in superior reaction kinetics and 
improved yields of primer extension reaction products. This new leaving group 
significantly accelerates monomer addition as well as trimer-assisted RNA primer 
extension, allowing efficient copying of a variety of short RNA templates with 
mixed sequences.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that chronic low back pain patients with 
fear-avoidance (FAR) or endurance behavior are at risk of treatment failure and 
pain maintenance, with bodily overuse or underuse being assumed as mediating 
mechanisms for pain chronification. This study sought to examine whether or not 
the avoidance-endurance model subgroups, FAR, distress-endurers (DER), 
eustress-endurers (EER), and adaptive responders (AR), differed in physical 
measures and outcomes after training therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 137 chronic low back pain patients were 
assessed before, at the end of, and 6 months after a 6-month rehabilitation 
training. Patients performed maximum back extension strength and trunk 
range-of-motion measures, flexion-relaxation tests, and completed the following 
questionnaires: Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire, Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire, Pain Disability Index, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and visual analog scale. 
Statistical analysis included cluster analysis, analysis of covariances, and 
mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: At baseline, avoidance-endurance model subgroups did not differ in 
physical measures and activity levels. At the end of training, patients' 
back-related health was significantly improved in all subgroups. However, the 
DER and the FAR were found to be more impaired before and after the intervention 
compared with EER and AR, as indicated by a higher pain intensity, higher 
disability levels, lower quality of life, and inferior working capacity.
DISCUSSION: Although FAR and DER did not differ in physical measures or activity 
levels from EER and AR, they demonstrated poor lower back-related health at 
baseline and after intervention. Thus, future research should elucidate as to 
which additional interventions could optimize their health.

AIM: To compare the cost-effectiveness of different disease-modifying therapies' 
strategies for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for different strategies of using 
disease-modifying therapies from a US third-party payer perspective. All costs 
were converted to 2014 US$.
RESULTS: Over 20 years, the total costs per patient were estimated at 
US$161,136.60 for Strategy 1 (symptom management [SM] alone), US$551,650.66 for 
Strategy 2 (SM and IFN-β-1a), US$703,463.60 for Strategy 3 (SM and natalizumab) 
and US$670,985.24 for Strategy 4 (SM and alemtuzumab). The accumulated 
quality-adjusted life years were 10.49, 10.66, 10.69 and 10.71 for each of the 
four Strategies 1-4, respectively. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were 2,297,141.53 comparing Strategy 2 to Strategy 1, and -1,623,918.00 
comparing Strategy 4 to Strategy 3.
CONCLUSION: Strategy 1 was the cost-effective strategy for treatment of 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when compared with other strategies.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with premature death and a number of serious 
complications. The presence of comorbid depression makes these outcomes more 
likely and results in increased healthcare costs. The aim of this work was to 
assess the health economic outcomes associated with having both diabetes and 
depression, and assess the cost-effectiveness of potential policy changes to 
improve the care pathway: improved opportunistic screening for depression, 
collaborative care for depression treatment, and the combination of both.
METHODS: A mathematical model of the care pathways experienced by people 
diagnosed with type-2 diabetes in England was developed. Both an NHS perspective 
and wider social benefits were considered. Evidence was taken from the published 
literature, identified via scoping and targeted searches.
RESULTS: Compared with current practice, all three policies reduced both the 
time spent with depression and the number of diabetes-related complications 
experienced. The policies were associated with an improvement in quality of 
life, but with an increase in health care costs. In an incremental analysis, 
collaborative care dominated improved opportunistic screening. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for collaborative care compared with current 
practice was £10,798 per QALY. Compared to collaborative care, the combined 
policy had an ICER of £68,017 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies targeted at identifying and treating depression early in 
patients with diabetes may lead to reductions in diabetes related complications 
and depression, which in turn increase life expectancy and improve 
health-related quality of life. Implementing collaborative care was 
cost-effective based on current national guidance in England.

OBJECTIVE: to validate STOPPFrail, a list of explicit criteria for potentially 
inappropriate medication (PIM) use in frail older adults with limited life 
expectancy.
DESIGN: a Delphi consensus survey of an expert panel comprising academic 
geriatricians, clinical pharmacologists, palliative care physicians, old age 
psychiatrists, general practitioners and clinical pharmacists.
SETTING: Ireland.
SUBJECTS: seventeen panellists.
METHODS: STOPPFrail criteria were initially created by the authors based on 
clinical experience and literature appraisal. Criteria were organised according 
to the physiological system; each criterion accompanied by an explanation. Using 
Delphi consensus methodology, panellists ranked their agreement with each 
criterion on a 5-point Likert scale and provided written feedback. Criteria with 
a median Likert response of 4/5 (agree/strongly agree) and a 25th centile of ≥4 
were included in the final list.
RESULTS: all panellists completed three Delphi rounds. Thirty criteria were 
proposed, 27 were accepted. The first two criteria suggest deprescribing 
medications without indication or where compliance is poor. The remaining 25 
criteria include lipid-lowering therapies, alpha-blockers for hypertension, 
anti-platelets, neuroleptics, memantine, proton-pump inhibitors, H2-receptor 
antagonists, anti-spasmodic agents, theophylline, leukotriene antagonists, 
calcium supplements, bone anti-resorptive therapy, selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, 
5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, alpha-1-selective blockers, muscarinic 
antagonists, oral diabetic agents, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor 
blockers, systemic oestrogens, multivitamins, nutritional supplements and 
prophylactic antibiotics. Consensus could not be reached on the inclusion of 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Full consensus was reached on the exclusion of 
anticoagulants and antidepressants from the list.
CONCLUSION: STOPPFrail comprises 27 criteria relating to medications that are 
potentially inappropriate in frail older patients with limited life expectancy. 
STOPPFrail may assist physicians in deprescribing medications in these patients.

Metabolic Dysfunctions in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Pathogenesis and 
Potential Metabolic Treatments.

Sciences, Department of Pharmacology, The University of Queensland Brisbane,

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
primarily characterized by loss of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord. The 
death of motor neurons leads to denervation of muscle which in turn causes 
muscle weakness and paralysis, decreased respiratory function and eventually 
death. Growing evidence indicates disturbances in energy metabolism in patients 
with ALS and animal models of ALS, which are likely to contribute to disease 
progression. Particularly, defects in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial 
dysfunction limit the availability of ATP to CNS tissues and muscle. Several 
metabolic approaches improving mitochondrial function have been investigated in 
vitro and in vivo and showed varying effects in ALS. The effects of metabolic 
approaches in ALS models encompass delays in onset of motor symptoms, protection 
of motor neurons and extension of survival, which signifies an important role of 
metabolism in the pathogenesis of the disease. There is now an urgent need to 
test metabolic approaches in controlled clinical trials. In addition, more 
detailed studies to better characterize the abnormalities in energy metabolism 
in patients with ALS and ALS models are necessary to develop metabolically 
targeted effective therapies that can slow the progression of the disease and 
prolong life for patients with ALS.

Rai and Binet staging systems are important to predict the outcome of patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but do not reflect the biologic 
diversity of the disease nor predict response to therapy, which ultimately shape 
patients' outcome. We devised a biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system based on 
the two most important prognostic parameters in CLL (i.e., IGHV mutational 
status and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] cytogenetics), separating 
three different risk groups: (1) low-risk (mutated IGHV + no adverse FISH 
cytogenetics [del(17p), del(11q)]); (2) intermediate-risk (either unmutated IGHV 
or adverse FISH cytogenetics) and (3) high-risk (unmutated IGHV + adverse FISH 
cytogenetics). In 524 unselected subjects with CLL, the 10-year overall survival 
was 82% (95% CI 76%-88%), 52% (45%-62%), and 27% (17%-42%) for the low-, 
intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Patients with low-risk 
comprised around 50% of the series and had a life expectancy comparable to the 
general population. The prognostic model was fully validated in two independent 
cohorts, including 417 patients representative of general CLL population and 337 
patients with Binet stage A CLL. The model had a similar discriminatory value as 
the CLL-IPI. Moreover, it applied to all patients with CLL independently of age, 
and separated patients with different risk within Rai or Binet clinical stages. 
The biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system presented here simplifies the CLL-IPI 
and could be useful in daily practice and to stratify patients in clinical 
trials.

Background While cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ischaemic heart disease 
and heart failure is considered cost-effective, this evidence may not be 
transferable to heart valve surgery patients. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the cost-effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation following heart 
valve surgery. Design We conducted a cost-utility analysis based on a randomised 
controlled trial of 147 patients who had undergone heart valve surgery and were 
followed for 6 months. Methods Patients were randomised to cardiac 
rehabilitation consisting of 12 weeks of physical exercise training and monthly 
psycho-educational consultations or to usual care. Costs were measured from a 
societal perspective and quality-adjusted life years were based on the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D). Estimates were presented as means and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on bootstrapping. Costs and effect 
differences were presented in a cost-effectiveness plane and were transformed 
into net benefit and presented in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
Results No statistically significant differences were found in total societal 
costs (-1609 Euros; 95% CI: -6162 to 2942 Euros) or in quality-adjusted life 
years (-0.000; 95% CI -0.021 to 0.020) between groups. However, approximately 
70% of the cost and effect differences were located below the x-axis in the 
cost-effectiveness plane, and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed 
that the probability for cost- effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation compared 
to usual care is at minimum 75%, driven by a tendency towards costs savings. 
Conclusions Cardiac rehabilitation after heart valve surgery may not have 
improved health-related quality of life in this study, but is likely to be 
cost-effective for society, outweighing the extra costs of cardiac 
rehabilitation.

OBJECTIVE: Data from the Health and Retirement Study were used to test a 
conceptual model integrating stress and coping, conservation of resources, and 
life-course theories, to investigate predictors of depression symptoms over 
8 years among a nationally representative sample of older adults aged 
50-91 years. The main investigative questions were: (1) Do older adults with 
cancer have a different 8-year symptomatic depression trajectory than those 
without cancer? (2) Do the differences in life-course factors, internal, 
external, and health-related resources within and between older adults have a 
differential effect on 8-year symptomatic depression trajectories for 
individuals with and without a cancer diagnosis?
METHODS: We used a two-level longitudinal panel design to test a multilevel 
growth model. We examined individual differences in depression symptoms between 
2000 and 2008, and tested multiple potential predictors. All those with a first 
diagnosis of cancer in 1998-2000 were included in the study (n = 200) together 
with a representative subsample of all noncancer cases (n = 1,190).
RESULTS: Significant two-way interaction effects were detected between having 
cancer and the absence of spouse/partner in the home, and cancer and lower life 
expectancy; each resulted in higher probabilities of depression. A significant 
three-way interaction effect was detected between cancer, gender, and social 
support; women with a cancer history and low social support had the highest 
probability of depression.
CONCLUSION: Assessment and intervention in the "survivorship" phase of cancer 
should target older adults with higher levels of depression early in the cancer 
experience, those with no partner present in home, those with lower life 
expectancy, and women with low social support.

BACKGROUND: The NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) offer help to smokers who want 
to quit. However, the proportion of smokers attending the SSSs is low and 
current figures show a continuing downward trend. This research addressed the 
problem of how to motivate more smokers to accept help to quit.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, of an 
intervention consisting of proactive recruitment by a brief computer-tailored 
personal risk letter and an invitation to a 'Come and Try it' taster session to 
provide information about the SSSs, compared with a standard generic letter 
advertising the service, in terms of attendance at the SSSs of at least one 
session and validated 7-day point prevalent abstinence at the 6-month follow-up.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention with follow-up 6 
months after the date of randomisation.
SETTING: SSSs and general practices in England.
PARTICIPANTS: All smokers aged ≥ 16 years identified from medical records in 
participating practices who were motivated to quit and who had not attended the 
SSS in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomised in the ratio 3 : 2 
(intervention to control) by a computer program.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention - brief personalised and tailored letter sent from 
the general practitioner using information obtained from the screening 
questionnaire and from medical records, and an invitation to attend a taster 
session, run by the local SSS. Control - standard generic letter from the 
general practice advertising the local SSS and the therapies available, and 
asking the smoker to contact the service to make an appointment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of people attending the first session of a 
6-week course over a period of 6 months from the receipt of the invitation 
letter, measured by records of attendance at the SSSs; (2) 7-day point prevalent 
abstinence at the 6-month follow-up, validated by salivary cotinine analysis; 
and (3) cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS: Eighteen SSSs and 99 practices within the SSS areas participated; 4384 
participants were randomised to the intervention (n = 2636) or control 
(n = 1748). One participant withdrew and 4383 were analysed. The proportion of 
people attending the first session of a SSS course was significantly higher in 
the intervention group than in the control group [17.4% vs. 9.0%; unadjusted 
odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 2.57; p < 0.001]. The 
validated 7-day point prevalent abstinence at the 6-month follow-up was 
significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (9.0% 
vs. 5.6%; unadjusted OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.15; p < 0.001), as was the 
validated 3-month prolonged abstinence and all other periods of abstinence 
measured by self-report. Using the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence decision-making threshold range of £20,000-30,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, the probability that the intervention was 
more cost-effective than the control was up to 27% at 6 months and > 86% over a 
lifetime horizon.
LIMITATIONS: Participating SSSs may not be representative of all SSSs in 
England. Recruitment was low, at 4%.
CONCLUSIONS: The Start2quit trial added to evidence that a proactive approach 
with an intensive intervention to deliver personalised risk information and 
offer a no-commitment introductory session can be successful in reaching more 
smokers and increasing the uptake of the SSS and quit rates. The intervention 
appears less likely to be cost-effective in the short term, but is highly likely 
to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon.
FUTURE WORK: Further research could assess the separate effects of these 
components.

The pecan nut is a nutrient-rich part of a healthy diet full of beneficial fatty 
acids and antioxidants, but can also cause allergic reactions in people 
suffering from food allergy to the nuts. The transcriptome of a developing pecan 
nut was characterized to identify the gene expression occurring during the 
process of nut development and to highlight those genes involved in fatty acid 
metabolism and those that commonly act as food allergens. Pecan samples were 
collected at several time points during the embryo development process including 
the water, gel, dough, and mature nut stages. Library preparation and sequencing 
were performed using Illumina-based mRNA HiSeq with RNA from four time points 
during the growing season during August and September 2012. Sequence analysis 
with Trinotate software following the Trinity protocol identified 133,000 
unigenes with 52,267 named transcripts and 45,882 annotated genes. A total of 
27,312 genes were defined by GO annotation. Gene expression clustering analysis 
identified 12 different gene expression profiles, each containing a number of 
genes. Three pecan seed storage proteins that commonly act as allergens, Car i 
1, Car i 2, and Car i 4, were significantly up-regulated during the time course. 
Up-regulated fatty acid metabolism genes that were identified included 
acyl-[ACP] desaturase and omega-6 desaturase genes involved in oleic and 
linoleic acid metabolism. Notably, a few of the up-regulated acyl-[ACP] 
desaturase and omega-6 desaturase genes that were identified have expression 
patterns similar to the allergen genes based upon gene expression clustering and 
qPCR analysis. These findings suggest the possibility of coordinated 
accumulation of lipids and allergens during pecan nut embryogenesis.

Men are catching up with women in the life expectancy game.

[No authors listed]

One reason men are catching up is because of falling smoking rates. To give an 
idea of the powerful effect of smoking rates on mortality, 800,000 American 
deaths from lung cancer have been avoided because of the decline in smoking 
rates between 1975 and 2000.

Differential Motor Unit Changes after Endurance or High-Intensity Interval 
Training.

PURPOSE: Using a novel technique of high-density surface EMG decomposition and 
motor unit (MU) tracking, we compared changes in the properties of vastus 
medialis and vastus lateralis MU after endurance (END) and high-intensity 
interval training (HIIT).
METHODS: Sixteen men were assigned to the END or the HIIT group (n = 8 each) and 
performed six training sessions for 14 d. Each session consisted of 8-12 × 60-s 
intervals at 100% peak power output separated by 75 s of recovery (HIIT) or 
90-120 min continuous cycling at ~65% V˙O2peak (END). Pre- and postintervention, 
participants performed 1) incremental cycling to determine V˙O2peak and peak 
power output and 2) maximal, submaximal (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% maximum 
voluntary contraction [MVC]), and sustained (until task failure at 30% MVC) 
isometric knee extensions while high-density surface EMG signals were recorded 
from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis. EMG signals were decomposed 
(submaximal contractions) into individual MU by convolutive blind source 
separation. Finally, MU were tracked across sessions by semiblind source 
separation.
RESULTS: After training, END and HIIT improved V˙O2peak similarly (by 5.0% and 
6.7%, respectively). The HIIT group showed enhanced maximal knee extension 
torque by ~7% (P = 0.02) and was accompanied by an increase in discharge rate 
for high-threshold MU (≥50% knee extension MVC) (P < 0.05). By contrast, the END 
group increased their time to task failure by ~17% but showed no change in MU 
discharge rates (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HIIT and END induce different adjustments in MU discharge rate 
despite similar improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness. Moreover, the changes 
induced by HIIT are specific for high-threshold MU. For the first time, we show 
that HIIT and END induce specific neuromuscular adaptations, possibly related to 
differences in exercise load intensity and training volume.

Early life stressors can affect aging and life expectancy in positive or 
negative ways. Individuals can adjust their behavior and molecular physiology 
based on early life experiences but relatively few studies have connected such 
mechanisms to demographic patterns in social organisms. Sociality buffers 
individuals from environmental influences and it is unclear how much early life 
stress affects later life history. Workers of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) 
were exposed to two stressors, Varroa parasitism and Paraquat exposure, early in 
life. Consequences were measured at the molecular, behavioral, and demographic 
level. While treatments did not significantly affect levels of oxidative damage, 
expression of select genes, and titers of the common deformed wing virus, most 
of these measures were affected by age. Some of the age effects, such as 
declining levels of deformed wing virus and oxidative damage, were opposite to 
our predictions but may be explained by demographic selection. Further analyses 
suggested some influences of worker behavior on mortality and indicated weak 
treatment effects on behavior. The latter effects were inconsistent among the 
two experiments. However, mortality rate was consistently reduced by Varroa mite 
stress during development. Thus, mortality was more responsive to early life 
stress than our other response variables. The lack of treatment effects on these 
measures may be due to the social organization of honey bees that buffers the 
individual from the impact of stressful developmental conditions.

Primary Prevention Strategies for Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity: A Brief 
Overview.

Menna P(1), Salvatorelli E.

Author information:

Italy.

The clinical use of doxorubicin and other antitumor anthracyclines is limited by 
a dose-related risk of cardiomyopathy and heart failure which may occur "on 
treatment" or any time, from months to years, after completing chemotherapy. 
Dose reductions diminish the incidence of cardiac events attributable to 
anthracyclines, but heart failure still occurs in some patients exposed to low 
or moderate anthracycline doses. Because anthracyclines improve the life 
expectancy of patients with, for example, breast cancer or lymphomas, preventing 
or diminishing the risk of early or delayed cardiotoxicity is of obvious 
clinical importance. Here, we briefly review some potential strategies of 
primary prevention that are based on what we know about the molecular mechanisms 
of cardiotoxicity, and what can be done, or might be done, to interfere with the 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and genetic determinants of cardiotoxicity.

Current practices for the management of Barrett's esophagus (BE) vary across 
Europe, as several national European guidelines exist. This Position Statement 
from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) is an attempt to 
homogenize recommendations and, hence, patient management according to the best 
scientific evidence and other considerations (e.g. health policy). A Working 
Group developed consensus statements, using the existing national guidelines as 
a starting point and considering new evidence in the literature. The Position 
Statement wishes to contribute to a more cost-effective approach to the care of 
patients with BE by reducing the number of surveillance endoscopies for patients 
with a low risk of malignant progression and centralizing care in expert centers 
for those with high progression rates.Main statements MS1 The diagnosis of BE is 
made if the distal esophagus is lined with columnar epithelium with a minimum 
length of 1 cm (tongues or circular) containing specialized intestinal 
metaplasia at histopathological examination. MS2 The ESGE recommends varying 
surveillance intervals for different BE lengths. For patients with an irregular 
Z-line/columnar-lined esophagus of < 1 cm, no routine biopsies or endoscopic 
surveillance is advised. For BE ≥ 1 cm and < 3 cm, BE surveillance should be 
repeated every 5 years. For BE ≥ 3 cm and < 10 cm, the interval for endoscopic 
surveillance should be 3 years. Patients with BE with a maximum extent ≥ 10 cm 
should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance endoscopies. Patients 
with limited life expectancy and advanced age should be discharged from 
endoscopic surveillance. MS3 The diagnosis of any degree of dysplasia (including 
"indefinite for dysplasia") in BE requires confirmation by an expert 
gastrointestinal pathologist. MS4 Patients with visible lesions in BE diagnosed 
as dysplasia or early cancer should be referred to a BE expert center. All 
visible abnormalities, regardless of the degree of dysplasia, should be removed 
by means of endoscopic resection techniques in order to obtain optimal 
histopathological staging MS5 All patients with a BE ≥ 10 cm, a confirmed 
diagnosis of low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia (HGD), or early cancer 
should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance and/or treatment. BE 
expert centers should meet the following criteria: annual case load of ≥10 new 
patients undergoing endoscopic treatment for HGD or early carcinoma per BE 
expert endoscopist; endoscopic and histological care provided by endoscopists 
and pathologists who have followed additional training; at least 30 supervised 
endoscopic resection and 30 endoscopic ablation procedures to acquire competence 
in technical skills, management pathways, and complications; multidisciplinary 
meetings with gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists to 
discuss patients with Barrett's neoplasia; access to experienced esophageal 
surgery; and all BE patients registered prospectively in a database.
