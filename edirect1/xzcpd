cancer ranked third. Overall, the number of new cancer cases among older adults 
in the region is expected to double by 2040, reaching 1.6 million new cases.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need for an urgent adaptation of 
healthcare systems across LAC by improving training in geriatrics for the 
oncology workforce, and by including older adults in clinical guidelines, 
insurance schemes, and cancer prevention policies.

We evaluated the association between individual-level socioeconomic status 
(SES), life expectancy, and mortality, in adult men and women from the general 
population living in Catalonia, a universal healthcare coverage setting. We used 
the Catalan Health Surveillance System database, which includes individual-level 
information on sociodemographic characteristics and mortality for all residents 
of Catalonia (Spain). We categorized individuals as high, medium, low or very 
low SES based on annual personal income and welfare receipt. We used 2016 
mortality data to estimate life expectancy at age 18, and the probability of 
death by age, sex and SES categories. We followed a total of 6,027,424 Catalan 
residents in 2016. Men and women of very low SES had 12.0 and 9.4 years lower 
life expectancy compared to men and women of high SES, respectively. Low SES was 
also strongly associated with mortality in both men and women of any age. In the 
entire adult population of Catalonia, despite the availability of universal, 
high quality healthcare coverage, low SES is associated with lower life 
expectancy and higher mortality. Solutions to these large inequalities may 
combine tailored health promotion and management interventions, with solutions 
coming from outside of the health sector.

Aging is a complex process. It is considered a risk factor for several diseases 
such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and 
diabetes, most of which have an oxidative and inflammatory base. Given that life 
expectancy is increasing, there is a present interest in the search for 
anti-aging strategies that allow a healthy aging. Interestingly, in Spain, where 
the Mediterranean Diet (MD) is the reference food pattern, life expectancy will 
have the highest average by 2040. This diet is characterized, among other items, 
by virgin olive oil intake, which contains between 50-200 mg/kg of 
hydroxytyrosol, a major polyphenolic component of olive oil. Hydroxytyrosol is 
formed by the hydrolysis of oleuropein during the maturing of olives, storage of 
olive oil, and preparation of table olives. It is a yield of oleuropein by 
microbiota action in the organism after virgin olive oil consumption. The daily 
intake in context of the MD is estimated to be around 0.15 and 30 mg/day. In the 
last few years, hydroxytyrosol has received increasing attention due to its 
multiple pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
pro-apoptotic activities. It has also been the focus of extensive research 
regarding its bioactivity. In this sense, hydroxytyrosol is under consideration 
for the development of new anti-aging strategies. In this review we will 
summarize the potential anti-aging effects of hydroxytyrosol and its protective 
role in several age-related diseases.

Objective: Mental illness often interferes with daily functioning and an 
individual's pattern of psychiatric signs and symptoms may predict risk of 
future disability. Understanding the linkage between psychiatric symptoms and 
impaired functioning is critical for accurate rehabilitation planning and legal 
assessment. Here, we investigated the stability of functional impairment 
measures over 18 months and their association with psychiatric symptoms. 
Moreover, we developed a clinical self-report measure that allows estimation of 
functional impairment levels over 18 month observation periods. Methods: 
Consecutively treated outpatients and daycare patients (N = 155) from several 
psychiatric units in Switzerland completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 
Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, Multidimensional Inventory for 
Dissociation, Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and WHO 
Disability Assessment Schedule at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month follow-up 
examinations. The association between symptoms functional impairment over time 
was investigated using longitudinal linear mixed models. Penalized regression 
was used to identify questionnaire items that best predicted functional 
impairment. Results: We found high stability in the extent of functional 
impairment over 18 months. Fear of negative evaluation, fatigue, concentration 
problems, negative alterations in mood, and dissociative symptoms showed the 
strongest association with functional impairment measures. The empirically 
derived scale for functional impairment prediction explained between 0.62 and 
0.77 of the variance in disability across various life domains. Conclusion: 
Given the capability for somatic and mental symptoms associated with social 
anxiety, depression, and dissociation to predict future disability, these 
symptoms have strong potential for guiding rehabilitation planning and 
prognostic evaluation in insurance medicine. The Functional Impairment 
Prediction Scale may serve as a valuable, empirical-based extension in legal 
assessments of how work capacity is affected by psychological factors.

Relationship) Profiles.

The spatial distribution of biodiversity (i.e., the biogeography) of the 
hot-spring microbiome is critical for understanding the microbial ecosystems in 
hot springs. We investigated the microbiome diversity scaling (changes) over 
space by analyzing the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension 
to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography. We built DAR 
models for archaea and bacteria with 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets from 165 hot 
springs globally. From the DAR models, we sketch out the biogeographic maps of 
hot-spring microbiomes by constructing: (i) DAR profile-measuring the archaea or 
bacteria diversity scaling over space (areas); (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity 
overlap or similarity) profile-estimating the PDO between two hot springs; (iii) 
MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile-predicting the global MAD; (iv) LRD/LGD 
(ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity) profile. We further 
investigated the differences between archaea and bacteria in their biogeographic 
maps. For example, the comparison of DAR-profile maps revealed that the archaea 
diversity is more heterogeneous (i.e., more diverse) or scaling faster than the 
bacterial diversity does in terms of species numbers (species richness), but is 
less heterogeneous (i.e., less diverse) or scaling slower than bacteria when the 
diversity (Hill numbers) were weighted in favor of more abundant dominant 
species. When the diversity is weighted equally in terms of species abundances, 
archaea, and bacteria are equally heterogeneous over space or scaling at the 
same rate. Finally, unified DAR models (maps) were built with the combined 
datasets of archaea and bacteria.

Interventional treatment with stents in pancreatic cancer is a topic that 
developed during recent years and new fields of palliative stent therapy have 
evolved. The increasing life expectancy of patients with unresectable pancreatic 
cancer increases the need for clinical and cost effective therapeutic 
interventions. Current literature, guidelines, practice and evidence were 
reviewed. Besides the most obvious biliary stenting via endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), pancreatic and gastroduodenal stenting as well 
as percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and the rapidly growing field 
of endosonographic stent implantation in the palliative care of patients with 
pancreatic cancer are being discussed from several points of view in this 
review.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication improves dyspeptic symptoms in 
8%-10%, prevents peptic ulcer and may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. 
Availability of a high quality diagnostic test and an effective treatment makes 
population screening and eradication of Helicobacter pylori an attractive 
option.
AIM: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori population 
screening and eradication.
METHODS: Cost effectiveness analysis and cost utility analysis alongside 
randomised controlled trial with 13 years follow-up. The evaluation has a 
societal perspective. A random general population sample of 20 011 individuals 
aged 40-65 were randomised and invited in 1998-1999; 12 530 were enrolled and, 
of these, 8658 have been successfully followed up at 1, 5, and 13 years after 
intervention. Questionnaires included the quality of life instrument SF-36. From 
SF-36 responses an SF-6D score was derived and used for calculation of 
quality-adjusted life years. Register data on costs, use of health care 
resources and medication were obtained for all randomised individuals. The 
intervention was an invitation to Helicobacter pylori screening by in-office 
blood test; positive tests were validated by 13 C-urea breath test. Those who 
tested positive were offered eradication therapy. Main outcome measures were 
Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year and life-years gained.
RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori population screening and eradication with 13 years 
follow-up was not effective in regards to quality of life and the cost per 
screened person was higher than not screening (mean difference 11 269 DKK [95% 
CI: 3175-19 362]). The probability of being cost-effective was 80% at a 
threshold of 400 000 DKK (approximately 53,800 Euros) of willingness-to-pay per 
life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori population screening and eradication with 
13 years follow-up was not effective in regards to quality of life and the cost 
of screening was higher than not screening.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
sunitinib versus interferon-alfa for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in Singapore.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states 
(progression-free, progressive disease, and death) was developed from a 
healthcare payer perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Survival curves from 
the pivotal trial of sunitinib versus interferon-alfa were extrapolated beyond 
the trial period to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and 
overall survival parametric distributions. Health state utilities were derived 
from the literature and direct costs were sourced from local public healthcare 
institutions. The sunitinib dose in the model reflected local prescribing 
practices whereby a combination of 50 mg (28 percent) and 37.5 mg (72 percent) 
strengths are used.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis comparing sunitinib versus interferon-alfa 
resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SGD191,061 
(USD139,757) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to variations in the utility value 
assumed for the progression-free health state and the price of sunitinib.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of any price reduction, sunitinib had an exceedingly 
high ICER and was not considered a cost-effective use of healthcare resources in 
Singapore's context for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. The findings 
from our evaluation will be useful to inform local healthcare decision making 
and resource allocations for tyrosine kinase inhibitors when appraised alongside 
comparative clinical effectiveness data and payer affordability considerations.

Carotid revascularization is an effective method of primary and secondary 
prevention of ischemic cerebral stroke in patients presenting with extracranial 
carotid atherosclerosis leading to significant stenosis of the internal carotid 
artery. Currently, the European guidelines recommend surgical revascularization 
in all symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis with a documented periprocedural 
death/stroke risk of <6%. Endovascular revascularization should be considered in 
symptomatic patients with anatomical and clinical features that contribute to 
making such patients at high surgical risk. According to the guidelines, 
revascularization should be considered in patients with >60% stenosis, in the 
presence of clinical and/or imaging features associated with an increased risk 
of ipsilateral stroke (in the presence of documented risk of perioperative 
stroke/death <3% and patient's life expectancy >5 years). In patients with low 
and/or average surgical risk should be considered carotid endarterectomy, while 
in patients who are deemed at high surgical risk carotid stenting should be 
considered.Nowadays, thanks to technological advances and improved operators' 
experience, carotid stenting can be considered a valuable therapeutic strategy.

Vaccines are a 20th century medical marvel. They have dramatically reduced the 
morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases and contributed to a 
striking increase in life expectancy around the globe. Nonetheless, determining 
vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that the 
current acellular vaccine (aPV) for Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) induces 
suboptimal immunity. Therefore, a major challenge is designing a next-generation 
vaccine that induces protective immunity without the adverse side effects of a 
whole-cell vaccine (wPV). Here we describe a protocol that we used to test the 
efficacy of a promising, novel adjuvant that skews immune responses to a 
protective Th1/Th17 phenotype and promotes a better clearance of a B. pertussis 
challenge from the murine respiratory tract. This article describes the protocol 
for mouse immunization, bacterial inoculation, tissue harvesting, and analysis 
of immune responses. Using this method, within our model, we have successfully 
elucidated crucial mechanisms elicited by a promising, next-generation acellular 
pertussis vaccine. This method can be applied to any infectious disease model in 
order to determine vaccine efficacy.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the article was to analyse how Finnish and Swedish 
speakers in Finland differ in health and labour market outcomes after sickness 
absence. Apart from many similarities, these two population groups differ in 
life expectancy and union stability and are supposed to be culturally distinct. 
Our analyses, therefore, help to shed light on the interrelation between culture 
and health.
STUDY DESIGN: We monitored health and labour market-related status 3 years after 
the first sickness absence.
METHODS: The register-based longitudinal data covered the years 1988-2010. 
Multinomial logistic regressions were used to quantify the odds of being 
unemployed, retired due to disability, otherwise outside the labour force or 
dead, as compared with being employed. The analyses were controlled for age, 
educational level, region of residence, population density, birth region, family 
status, job industry, income, homeownership, time period and time on sick leave.
RESULTS: Unemployment after sickness absence was notably more common for Finnish 
speakers than for Swedish speakers. In the fully adjusted models, the odds 
ratios were 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.67) in men and 1.29 (95% 
CI 1.07-1.48) in women. Disability pension, being outside the labour force and 
having died were also more frequent outcomes for Finnish speakers than for 
Swedish speakers, although most of this variation could be attributed to 
socio-economic and demographic characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The article illustrates that register-based analyses can be 
effective tools for assessing and identifying persons with latent problems that 
impede their functioning in the labour market. These findings also suggest that 
culturally related factors presumably play an important role in this concern.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes has increased substantially in Mexico 
over the last 40 years, leading to significant impacts on population health and 
the healthcare system. Technology-based solutions may improve diabetes outcomes 
in areas where lack of efficient transportation creates barriers to care.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a technology-based 
diabetes care management program from the perspective of the Mexican healthcare 
system.
METHODS: Clinical outcomes and cost data from a 3-arm randomized clinical trial 
of Dulce Wireless Tijuana, a diabetes care management program incorporating 
short-term mobile technology, were used as inputs in a validated simulation 
model for type 2 diabetes. Study arms included a control group (CG), Project 
Dulce diabetes care management (PD), and Project Dulce with technology 
enhancement (PD-TE).
RESULTS: Intervention costs were $1448 for PD and $1740 for PD-TE compared with 
$740 for CG. Both intervention arms increased quality-adjusted life-years and 
costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PD was $1635 and for PD-TE 
was $2220, both compared with CG. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
PD-TE versus PD was $4299. The results were sensitive to the time horizon. The 
PE and PD-TE interventions were cost-effective under time horizons of 15 to 20 
years, but were not cost-effective under time horizons of 5 to 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the PD and PD-TE were highly cost-effective from a Mexican 
health system perspective. Considering the economic impact of the diabetes 
epidemic and the widespread use of cellular technology in Mexico, implementation 
of PD-TE is warranted.

Microbiology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.

The bacteriology, organoleptic quality and shelf-life extension of radurized 
beef cuts were investigated. Application of doses of 2 kGy to vacuum-packed meat 
caused a considerable change in the bacterial population by elimination of the 
pseudomonads, Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. The LLP group of lactic acid 
bacteria was relatively resistant to radiation, and after radurization was 
mostly comprised of Lactobacillus species. The lactobacilli multiplied rapidly 
on the meat during storage at 4 C, and reached relatively high numbers toward 
the end of the storage period. Odor and appearance evaluations were carried out 
at regular intervals and were used together with organoleptic testing and 
bacteriological analyses to determine the shelf-life extension of radurized beef 
cuts. A doubling in the shelf-life of samples irradiated to 2 kGy was attained 
when compared to non-irradiated (control) samples.

In two orchard experiments, interplanting wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Stacy) 
around either newly planted or 4-year-old well-established peach trees did not 
suppress (P ≤ 0.05) the population density of the ring nematode, Criconemella 
xenoplax, after 3 years. Furthermore, inter-planting wheat around newly planted 
trees reduced tree growth, perhaps the result of competition for water and (or) 
nutrients. Wheat root exudate was not as attractive to C. xenoplax as peach root 
exudate, but wheat root exudate did not repel the nematode either. Stacy wheat 
appeared to be more beneficial as a preplant rather than as a postplant ground 
cover management tool for suppressing the population density of C. xenoplax.

Background. Economic evaluations are less commonly applied to implementation 
interventions compared to clinical interventions. The efficacy of an 
implementation strategy to improve adherence to screening guidelines among 
first-degree relatives of people with colorectal cancer was recently evaluated 
in a randomized-controlled trial. Using these trial data, we examined the costs 
and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from societal and health care funder 
perspectives. Method. In this prospective, trial-based evaluation, mean costs, 
and outcomes were calculated. The primary outcome of the trial was the 
proportion of participants who had screening tests in the year following the 
intervention commensurate with their risk category. Quality-adjusted life years 
were included as secondary outcomes. Intervention costs were determined from 
trial records. Standard Australian unit costs for 2016/2017 were applied. 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the net benefit framework. Nonparametric 
bootstrapping was used to calculate uncertainty intervals (UIs) around the costs 
and the incremental net monetary benefit statistic. Results. Compared with usual 
care, mean health sector costs were $17 (95% UI [$14, $24]) higher for those 
receiving the intervention. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 
primary trial outcome was calculated to be $258 (95% UI [$184, $441]) per 
additional person appropriately screened. The significant difference in 
adherence to screening guidelines between the usual care and intervention groups 
did not translate into a mean quality-adjusted life year difference. Discussion. 
Providing information on both the costs and outcomes of implementation 
interventions is important to inform public health care investment decisions. 
Challenges in the application of cost-utility analysis hampered the 
interpretation of results and potentially underestimated the value of the 
intervention. Further research in the form of a modeled extrapolation of the 
intermediate increased adherence effect and distributional cost-effectiveness to 
include equity requirements is warranted.

Therapeutic advances, including the availability of oral iron chelators and new 
non-invasive methods for early detection and treatment of iron overload, have 
significantly improved the life expectancy and quality of thalassemia patients, 
with a consequent increase in their reproductive potential and desire to have 
children. Hundreds of pregnancies have been reported so far, highlighting that 
women carefully managed in the preconception phase usually carry out a 
successful gestation and labor, both in case of spontaneous conception and 
assisted reproductive techniques. A multidisciplinary team including a 
cardiologist, an endocrinologist, and a gynecologist, under the supervision of 
an expert in beta-thalassemia, should be involved. During pregnancy, a close 
follow-up of maternal disorders and of the baby's status is recommended. 
Hemoglobin should be maintained over 10 g/dL to allow normal fetal growth. 
Chelators are not recommended; nevertheless, it may be reasonable to consider 
restarting chelation therapy with desferrioxamine towards the end of the second 
trimester when the potential benefits outweigh the potential fetal risk. Women 
with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia who have never previously been 
transfused or who have received only minimal transfusion therapy are at risk of 
severe alloimmune anemia if blood transfusions are required during pregnancy. 
Since pregnancy increases the risk of thrombosis three-fold to four-fold and 
thalassemia is also a hypercoagulable state, the recommendation is to keep women 
who are at higher risk -such as those who are not regularly transfused and those 
splenectomised- on prophylaxis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

PURPOSE: The 14th Japan-Korea joint symposium on cancer and aging research was 
held at an auditorium of Saga University, Japan, May 31-Jun 2, 2018. 
Participants presented 31 oral and 21 poster presentations, two lectures at a 
luncheon seminar, plus special lectures from two Korean Emeritus Professors and 
founders of our joint symposia. The essential parts of the lectures are reviewed 
here.
RESULTS: This Symposium was called Japan-Korea, because the host country comes 
first. Our symposia are organized every 18 months and the program includes 
keynote and plenary lectures, and oral and poster presentations. (1) Subjects 
related to cancer development at this symposium were: prostate cancer 
progression, molecules activating GSK3β, suppressing the activation of cancer 
stem cells, profiling human B cell receptor repertoires, and hereditary 
gastrointestinal cancer syndrome. (2) Subjects related to treatment were: 
G-quadruplex ligands for glioma stem cells, tankyrase inhibitor for colorectal 
cancer, and eradication of ATL. (3) Cancer prevention subjects were: physical 
adsorption of EGCG to cell membrane, inhibition of immune evasion of cancer 
cells with EGCG, and prevention with antidiabetic agents. (4) Aging subjects 
were life span extension with Toll-like receptor 5 vaccine and reversal of 
senescence with inhibitors of ATM and ROCK. (5) The results of epidemiology 
focused on aldehyde dehyrogenase-2 and alcohol consumption.
CONCLUSION: The 14th symposium demonstrated the cutting-edge of presentations 
with discussion of numerous ideas by the participants.

Epidemiology of breast cancer in the Arab region is understudied as compared 
with Western countries. We aimed to examine breast cancer epidemiology in Arab 
countries from 1990 to 2016. We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease, 2016 data 
for breast cancer among women in 22 Arab countries. Epidemiological measures 
including incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were 
analyzed for breast cancer in women from 1990 to 2016. We also measured the 
burden of breast cancer stratified by the sociodemographic index (SDI). Our 
analysis indicates that the incidence of breast cancer in Arab women has risen 
over the past 26 years, but is still lower than global averages. In 2016, there 
were 45,980 new cases (28/100,000) and 20,063 deaths (11/100,000) in the region. 
The burden of breast cancer as estimated by DALYs was also lower than the global 
rates and tended to increase with increasing SDI. Although some studies have 
reported that Arab women present with breast cancer at a younger age, our 
analysis of age-specific rates, indicates that this is not statistically 
significant. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive plan to improve public 
awareness, screening, diagnosis, and treatment is required to reduce the growing 
burden of breast cancer in the Arab world.

Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) or celiac artery compression syndrome is 
caused by extrinsic compression by the median arcuate ligament. It is often 
asymptomatic, but it can cause intestinal symptoms suggestive of angina. We 
present a patient with repeated episodes of postprandial pain, nausea and 
occasional vomiting. After several studies, it was concluded that the 
symptomatology was attributable to this syndrome. Conservative treatment was 
performed due to the coexistence of underlying neoplastic disease and low life 
expectancy.

Background Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are a common public health 
metric used to consistently estimate and compare health loss because of both 
fatal and nonfatal disease burden. The annual number of DALY because of adult 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States is unknown. Our 
objective was to estimate the DALY after adult nontraumatic, emergency medical 
services-treated OHCA, and to compare OHCA DALY to other leading causes of death 
and disability in the US. Methods and Results The DALY were calculated as the 
sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. The years of life 
lost were calculated using all adult nontraumatic emergency medical 
services-treated OHCA with complete data from the national Cardiac Arrest 
Registry to Enhance Survival database for 2016, and actuarial data for remaining 
life expectancy at the age of death. Cerebral performance category scores from 
the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database and previously 
established disability weights were used to estimate years lived with 
disability. The cohort's calculated DALY were extrapolated to a national level 
to estimate total US DALY. Data were reported as total, mean, and DALY per 
100 000 individuals. A total of 59 752 OHCA met study inclusion criteria. The 
DALY for the study population were 1 194 993 (years of life lost, 1 194 069; 
years lived with disability, 924) in 2016. The estimated total DALY following 
adult nontraumatic emergency medical services-treated OHCA in the US were 4 354 
 192 (years of life lost, 4 350  825; years lived with disability, 3365) for the 
index year 2016. The rate of OHCA DALY were 1347 per 100 000 population, which 
ranked third in the US behind ischemic heart disease (2447) and low back and 
neck pain (1565). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings. Conclusions 
Adult nontraumatic OHCA is a leading cause of annual DALY in the US and should 
be a focus of public health policy and resources.

There Is Still Time to Be Active: Self-Perceptions of Aging, Physical Activity, 
and the Role of Perceived Residual Lifetime Among Older Adults.

Beyer AK, Wiest M, Wurm S.

Self-perceptions of aging (SPA) are a resource in later life. As aging is 
accompanied with perceptions of the finitude of life, it is assumed that 
perceived residual lifetime may play a role in the relationship between SPA and 
health behavior. Among older adults aged 65 years and older, the present study 
tested whether the relationships between gain- and loss-related SPA and two 
kinds of physical activity are moderated by perceived residual lifetime. Data 
were based on 2.367 participants over a 3-year period. Participants with less 
gain-related SPA were less likely to walk on a regular basis; however, a longer 
residual lifetime compensated for this negative effect. In addition, 
participants did sports more often if they not only held less loss-related SPA 
but also perceived a longer residual lifetime. These results emphasize the 
importance of perceived residual lifetime in health promotion interventions 
targeting physical activity in older adults.

AIMS: Ambient air pollution is a major health risk, leading to respiratory and 
cardiovascular mortality. A recent Global Exposure Mortality Model, based on an 
unmatched number of cohort studies in many countries, provides new hazard ratio 
functions, calling for re-evaluation of the disease burden. Accordingly, we 
estimated excess cardiovascular mortality attributed to air pollution in Europe.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The new hazard ratio functions have been combined with 
ambient air pollution exposure data to estimate the impacts in Europe and the 28 
countries of the European Union (EU-28). The annual excess mortality rate from 
ambient air pollution in Europe is 790 000 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
645 000-934 000], and 659 000 (95% CI 537 000-775 000) in the EU-28. Between 40% 
and 80% are due to cardiovascular events, which dominate health outcomes. The 
upper limit includes events attributed to other non-communicable diseases, which 
are currently not specified. These estimates exceed recent analyses, such as the 
Global Burden of Disease for 2015, by more than a factor of two. We estimate 
that air pollution reduces the mean life expectancy in Europe by about 2.2 years 
with an annual, attributable per capita mortality rate in Europe of 133/100 000 
per year.
CONCLUSION: We provide new data based on novel hazard ratio functions suggesting 
that the health impacts attributable to ambient air pollution in Europe are 
substantially higher than previously assumed, though subject to considerable 
uncertainty. Our results imply that replacing fossil fuels by clean, renewable 
energy sources could substantially reduce the loss of life expectancy from air 
pollution.

In this paper we describe the Subnational Human Development Database. This 
database contains for the period 1990-2017 for 1625 regions within 161 countries 
the national and subnational values of the Subnational Human Development Index 
(SHDI), for the three dimension indices on the basis of which the SHDI is 
constructed - education, health and standard of living --, and for the four 
indicators needed to create the dimension indices -- expected years of 
schooling, mean years of schooling, life expectancy and gross national income 
per capita. The subnational values of the four indicators were computed using 
data from statistical offices and from the Area Database of the Global Data Lab, 
which contains indicators aggregated from household surveys and census datasets. 
Values for missing years were estimated by interpolation and extrapolation from 
real data. By normalizing the population-weighted averages of the indicators to 
their national levels in the UNDP-HDI database, values of the SHDI and its
