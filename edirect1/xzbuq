BACKGROUND: No agreement has been reached on the long-term survival prospects 
for patients with Cushing's disease. We studied life expectancy in patients who 
had received curative treatment and whose hypercortisolism remained in remission 
for more than 10 years, and identified factors determining their survival.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, multinational, retrospective cohort study using 
individual case records from specialist referral centres in the UK, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, and New Zealand. Inclusion criteria for participants, who had all 
been in studies reported previously in peer-reviewed publications, were 
diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's disease, being cured of hypercortisolism 
for a minimum of 10 years at study entry, and continuing to be cured with no 
relapses until the database was frozen or death. We identified the number and 
type of treatments used to achieve cure, and used mortality as our primary 
endpoint. We compared mortality rates between patients with Cushing's disease 
and the general population, and expressed them as standardised mortality ratios 
(SMRs). We analysed survival data with multivariate analysis (Cox regression) 
with no corrections for multiple testing.
FINDINGS: The census dates on which the data were frozen ranged from Dec 31, 
2009, to Dec 1, 2014. We obtained data for 320 patients with 3790 person-years 
of follow-up from 10 years after cure (female:male ratio of 3:1). The median 
patient follow-up was 11·8 years (IQR 17-26) from study entry and did not differ 
between countries. There were no significant differences in demographic 
characteristics, duration of follow-up, comorbidities, treatment number, or type 
of treatment between women and men, so we pooled data from both sexes for 
survival analysis. 51 (16%) of the cohort died during follow-up from study entry 
(10 years after cure). Median survival from study entry was similar for women 
(31 years; IQR 19-38) and men (28 years; 24-42), and about 40 years (IQR 30-48) 
from remission. The overall SMR for all-cause mortality was 1·61 (95% CI 
1·23-2·12; p=0·0001). The SMR for circulatory disease was increased at 2·72 
(1·88-3·95; p<0·0001), but deaths from cancer were not higher than expected 
(0·79, 0·41-1·51). Presence of diabetes, but not hypertension, was an 
independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 2·82, 95% CI 1·29-6·17; 
p=0·0095). We noted a step-wise reduction in survival with increasing number of 
treatments. Patients cured by pituitary surgery alone had long-term survival 
similar to that of the general population (SMR 0·95, 95% CI 0·58-1·55) compared 
with those who were not (2·53, 1·82-3·53; p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Patients with Cushing's disease who have been in remission for 
more than 10 years are at increased risk of overall mortality compared with the 
general population, particularly from circulatory disease. However, median 
survival from cure is excellent at about 40 years of remission. Treatment 
complexity and an increased number of treatments, reflecting disease that is 
more difficult to control, appears to negatively affect survival. Pituitary 
surgery alone is the preferred treatment to secure an optimum outcome, and 
should be done in a centre of surgical excellence.

BACKGROUND: Following primary vaccination of adults ⩾65years of age with 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), immune responses 
increase and thereafter appear to decrease over time. With increased life 
expectancy worldwide, revaccination with PPSV23 may be required for continued 
protection of the elderly population against pneumococcal disease. The present 
study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of revaccination with PPSV23 in 
the Japanese elderly.
METHODS: Depending on prior history of PPSV23 vaccination, adults aged ⩾70years 
were given a first dose (primary group; N=81) or second dose (revaccination 
group; N=161, at least 5years after first dose) of PPSV23 intramuscularly. 
Subjects were matched for gender, age, and number and type of comorbidity across 
both groups. Blood samples were collected before and 4weeks postvaccination to 
measure serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations and 
opsonophagocytic killing activity (OPA) antibody titers to serotypes included in 
the vaccine. Injection-site and systemic adverse events (AEs) were collected for 
14days postvaccination.
RESULTS: Baseline serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and 
OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) were generally higher in subjects with a prior 
history of PPSV23 vaccination than in PPSV23-naïve subjects. The levels of IgG 
GMCs and OPA GMTs after revaccination were generally comparable to those 
observed after primary vaccination. Incidences of systemic AEs were comparable 
between the 2 groups. Although incidences of injection-site AEs were higher 
following revaccination than primary vaccination, the difference was not 
clinically significant as most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and 
resolved within 5days after revaccination without treatment.
CONCLUSION: Revaccination with PPSV23 was well tolerated and associated with 
increases in serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titers in the elderly 
who received a prior PPSV23 dose at least 5years before. Revaccination with 
PPSV23 can be safely implemented in the elderly for continued prevention against 
pneumococcal disease.

OBJECTIVE: Major thalassemia is one of the hematological diseases requiring 
multiple blood transfusions, which results in iron overload in the liver, heart 
and other organs. Current iron chelation therapy consists of intravenous (IV) 
deferoxamine and oral deferasirox and deferiprone. Although these chelators are 
effective, many side effects are reported. In the present study, the 
iron-chelating effect of ciprofloxacin with good oral absorption was 
investigated.
METHODS: Thirty male albino Wistar rats were used for the study. Ciprofloxacin 
(7 or 14 mg/kg per day) was administered simultaneously with iron (0.03 g/kg per 
day) or after one-month administration of iron. Ciprofloxacin effect on iron 
absorption in the liver and heart was studied carefully using atomic absorption.
RESULTS: A significant decrease in the liver and heart iron following the 
ciprofloxacin (14 mg/kg per day) administration was observed, when compared with 
the control group. This ciprofloxacin-induced tissue iron depletion was more 
pronounced when it was administered simultaneously with iron, when it was 
administered for a longer duration (2 months rather than 1 month) and when it 
was given in higher doses (14 mg/kg per day).
CONCLUSION: Administration of ciprofloxacin may help to decrease the burden of 
parenteral administration, thereby improving compliance and also the life 
expectancy of thalassemic patients.

Publisher: AMAÇ: Talasemi majör, karaciğer, kalp ve diğer organlarda demir 
yüklenmesiyle sonuçlanan, çoklu kan transfüzyonları gerektiren hematolojik 
hastalıklardan biridir. Güncel demir şelasyon tedavisi, intravenöz (IV) 
defroksamin ve oral deferasiroks ve deferipron uygulamasını içermektedir. Bu 
şelatörlerin etkili olmalarına karşın, birçok yan etkileri bulunmaktadır. Bu 
çalışmada, iyi oral absorbsiyonlu siprofloksasinin demir bağlayıcı etkileri 
araştırılmıştır. YÖNTEMLER: Bu çalışmada 30 erkek Wistar sıçanı kullanıldı. 
Siprofloksasin (7 veya 14 mg/kg/gün), demirle aynı zamanda (0.03 g/kg/gün) veya 
1 aylık demir uygulaması sonrası uygulanmıştır. Siprofloksasinin karaciğer ve 
kalpteki demir absorbsiyonu üzerine olan etkisi atomik absorbsiyon kullanılarak 
dikkatlice çalışılmıştır.
BULGULAR: Kontrol grubuyla karşılaştırıldığında, siprofloksasin uygulamasını (14 
mg/kg/gün) takiben karaciğer ve kalp demirinde anlamlı bir düşüş gözlenmiştir. 
Siprofloksasinle indüklenen bu doku demir deplesyonu yüksek dozda daha 
belirgindir. SONUÇ: Siprofloksasin uygulaması, uyumluluğu ve ayrıca talasemik 
hastaların yaşam beklentisini artırarak, parenteral uygulama yükünü azaltmaya 
yardımcı olabilir.

The Use of Economic Evaluation to Inform Newborn Screening Policy Decisions: The 
Washington State Experience.

POLICY POINTS: Newborn screening not only saves lives but can also yield net 
societal economic benefit, in addition to benefits such as improved quality of 
life to affected individuals and families. Calculations of net economic benefit 
from newborn screening include the monetary equivalent of avoided deaths and 
reductions in costs of care for complications associated with late-diagnosed 
individuals minus the additional costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment 
associated with prompt diagnosis. Since 2001 the Washington State Department of 
Health has successfully implemented an approach to conducting evidence-based 
economic evaluations of disorders proposed for addition to the state-mandated 
newborn screening panel.
CONTEXT: Economic evaluations can inform policy decisions on the expansion of 
newborn screening panels. This article documents the use of cost-benefit models 
in Washington State as part of the rule-making process that resulted in the 
implementation of screening for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) 
deficiency and 4 other metabolic disorders in 2004, cystic fibrosis (CF) in 
2006, 15 other metabolic disorders in 2008, and severe combined immune 
deficiency (SCID) in 2014.
METHODS: We reviewed Washington State Department of Health internal reports and 
spreadsheet models of expected net societal benefit of adding disorders to the 
state newborn screening panel. We summarize the assumptions and findings for 2 
models (MCAD and CF) and discuss them in relation to findings in the 
peer-reviewed literature.
FINDINGS: The MCAD model projected a benefit-cost ratio of 3.4 to 1 based on 
assumptions of a 20.0 percentage point reduction in infant mortality and a 13.9 
percentage point reduction in serious developmental disability. The CF model 
projected a benefit-cost ratio of 4.0-5.4 to 1 for a discount rate of 3%-4% and 
a plausible range of 1-2 percentage point reductions in deaths up to age 10 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: The Washington State cost-benefit models of newborn screening were 
broadly consistent with peer-reviewed literature, and their findings of net 
benefit appear to be robust to uncertainty in parameters. Public health newborn 
screening programs can develop their own capacity to project expected costs and 
benefits of expansion of newborn screening panels, although it would be most 
efficient if this capacity were shared among programs.

Life expectancy in patients with schizophrenia is reduced by 20 years for men 
and 15 years for women compared to the general population. About 60% of the 
excess mortality is due to physical illnesses, with cardiovascular disease being 
dominant. CHANGE was a randomized, parallel-group, superiority, multi-centre 
trial with blinded outcome assessment, testing the efficacy of an intervention 
aimed to improve cardiovascular risk profile and hereby potentially reduce 
mortality. A total of 428 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 
abdominal obesity were recruited and centrally randomized 1:1:1 to 12 months of 
lifestyle coaching plus care coordination plus treatment as usual (N=138), or 
care coordination plus treatment as usual (N=142), or treatment as usual alone 
(N=148). The primary outcome was 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease assessed 
post-treatment and standardized to age 60. At follow-up, the mean 10-year risk 
of cardiovascular disease was 8.4 ± 6.7% in the group receiving lifestyle 
coaching, 8.5 ± 7.5% in the care coordination group, and 8.0 ± 6.5% in the 
treatment as usual group (p=0.41). We found no intervention effects for any 
secondary or exploratory outcomes, including cardiorespiratory fitness, physical 
activity, weight, diet and smoking. In conclusion, the CHANGE trial did not 
support superiority of individual lifestyle coaching or care coordination 
compared to treatment as usual in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders and abdominal obesity.

[Local population of Eritrichium caucasicum as an object of mathematical 
modelling. I. Life cycle graph and a nonautonomous matrix model].

[Article in Russian]

Logofet DO, Belova IN, Kazantseva ES, Onipchenko VG.

For the plant species, which is considered a short-lived perennial, we have 
composed a scale of ontogenetic stages and the life cycle graph (LCG) according 
to annual observations on permanent sample plots in an Alpine lichen heath 
during the 2009-2014 period. The LCG that reflects seed reproduction has been 
reduced to the one that avoids the stage of soil seed bank, yet preserves the 
arcs of annual recruitment. The corresponding matrix model of stage-structured 
population dynamics has four stages: juvenile plants (including seedlings), 
virginal, generative, and 'terminally generative' (the plants die after seed 
production). Model calibration reduces to directly calculating the rates of 
transition between stages and those of delays within stages from the data of 
only one time step, while keeping the two reproduction rates uncertain, yet 
confined to the quantitative bounds of observed recruitment. This has enabled us 
to determine a feasible range for the dominant eigenvalue of the model matrix, 
i.e., the quantitative bounds for the measure of how the local population adapts 
to its environment, at each of the five time steps, resulting in aformally 
nonautonomous model. To obtain 'age-specific parameters' from a stage-classified 
model, we have applied the technique that constructs a virtual absorbing Markov 
chain and calculates its fundamental matrix. In a nonautonomous model, the 
estimates of life expectancy also depend on the time of observation (that fixes 
certain environmental conditions), and vary from two to nearly seven years. The 
estimates reveal how specifically short lives the short-lived perennial, while 
their range motivates the task to average the model matrices over the whole 
period of observation. The model indicates that Eritrichium caucasicum plants 
spend the most part of their life span in the virginal stage under each of the 
environment conditions observed, thus revealing the place retention strategy by 
C. K6rner (2003), or the delayed-development strategy by L.A. Zhukova (1995). We 
discuss the prospects of model experiments with a logically nonautonomous model 
to forecast the long-term dynamics of E. caucasicum under a scenario of climate 
changes.

[RANK INDICES METHOD AND ITS USE FOR THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF POPULATION 
HEALTH].

[Article in Russian]

Bolshakov AM, Krutko VN, Smirnova TM, Chankov SV.

There is presented a calculation method aimed to elevate the informative value 
of the integral indices of the social and hygienic monitoringfor purposes of 
comparative analysis. The method of rank indices is based on the ranking of 
monitoring objects on the values of primary indices on the base of which there 
are calculated the integral such indices as, for example, life expectancy. There 
are presented results of the use of this method for the comparative analysis of 
mortality rate in WHO Member States for the period of 1990-2011. There were 
revealed specialfeatures of mortality trends which cannot be detected when using 
only mortality rates or the life expectancy. In particular, for Russia there was 
shown that, in spite of the downward trend in child and adolescent mortality 
rate observed in the last decade, the country's world rankings for these indices 
fail to achieve the level of 1990. This means that the competitiveness of the 
country, sharply declined in the 90's, was not restored until now. There are 
described some features of the use of the method of rank indices for the 
analysis of indices of the environment state, public health and its 
socio-economic determinants.

INTRODUCTION: Osteopetrosis is an autosomal metabolic bone disease characterized 
by a decrease in bone resorption. It can be dominant or recessive. The patient 
often has increased bone fragility with fractures, which are usually the first 
sign of disease. Symptoms are variable, ranging from mild hematological 
disorders to severe neurological complications that can be life threatening. 
This work reports on the contribution of single-photon emission computed 
tomography (SPECT)/CT in the diagnosis and management of osteoarticular 
complications of marble bone disease, based on a clinical case.
CASE REPORT: A 2-year-old child, born after a consanguineous marriage, was 
hospitalized because of mucocutaneous pallor, splenomegaly, failure to thrive, 
and altered psychomotor development. Radiographic examination showed signs of 
osteopetrosis. SPECT/CT revealed a double fracture of the right coracoid process 
and the 10th right rib.
DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION: Fractures are a common complication of osteopetrosis. 
They are spontaneous or associated with minor trauma. SPECT/CT is important in 
the evaluation of the extension of bone lesions, and it confirms the diagnosis 
of osteomyelitis or fracture when radiological images are atypical or clinical 
expression is unusual.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of expanding screening and treatment for 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Discrete-time Markov model.
METHODS: We modeled HCV progression and transmission to analyze the costs and 
benefits of investment in screening and treatment over a 20-year time horizon. 
Population-level parameters were estimated using National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey data and published literature. We considered 3 screening 
scenarios that vary in terms of clinical guidelines and physician awareness of 
guidelines. For each screening scenario, we modeled 3 approaches to treatment, 
varying the fibrosis stage of treatment initiation. Net social value was the key 
model outcome, calculated as the value of benefits from improved 
quality-adjusted survival and reduced transmission minus screening, treatment, 
and medical costs.
RESULTS: Expanded screening policies generated the largest value to society. 
However, this value is constrained by the availability of treatment to diagnosed 
patients. Screening all individuals in the population generates $0.68 billion in 
social value if diagnosed patients are treated in fibrosis stages F3-F4 compared 
with $824 billion if all diagnosed patients in stages F0-F4 are treated. 
Moreover, increased screening generates cumulative net social value by year 8 to 
9 under expanded treatment policies compared with 20 years if only patients in 
stages F3-F4 are treated.
CONCLUSIONS: Although increasing screening for HCV may generate some value to 
society, only when paired with expanded access to treatment at earlier disease 
stages will it produce considerable value. Such a "test and treat" strategy is 
likely to entail higher short-term costs but also yield the greatest social 
benefits.

Costs and spillover effects of private insurers' coverage of hepatitis C 
treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment incentives for private payers may 
be misaligned because payers must bear immediate costs and may not realize 
long-term benefits. However, these benefits may accrue to future payers, 
including Medicare. We examined how and to what extent private payers' current 
HCV treatment coverage decisions impact Medicare's and private payers' future 
costs.
STUDY DESIGN: Discrete-time Markov model.
METHODS: We modeled HCV disease progression and transmission to simulate the 
economic and social effects of different private-payer HCV treatment scenarios 
on Medicare. The model examined differences between a baseline scenario (current 
practice guidelines) and 2 alternative scenarios that expand treatment coverage. 
Spillover effects were measured as reduced HCV treatment costs and medical 
expenditures in Medicare. We calculated the spillover effects and net social 
value of each scenario (total value of quality-adjusted life-years accrued over 
time minus cumulative treatment and medical costs).
RESULTS: With expanded HCV treatment coverage, private payers experience reduced 
medical expenditures in the 3-to-5-year time horizon; however, they still face 
higher treatment costs. Over a 20-year horizon, private payers experience 
overall savings of $10 billion to $14 billion after treatment costs. The 
expansion of coverage by private payers generates positive spillover benefits to 
Medicare of $0.3 billion to $0.7 billion over a 5-year horizon, and $4 billion 
to $11 billion over a 20-year horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: When private payers increase HCV treatment coverage, they may 
achieve significant savings while inducing spillover benefits to Medicare. 
Future savings, however, may not motivate immediate treatment investments among 
private payers who experience high beneficiary turnover.

BACKGROUND: Many developing countries are experiencing rapid ecological changes 
such as deforestation and shifting agricultural practices. These environmental 
changes may have an important consequence on malaria due to their impact on 
vector survival and reproduction. Despite intensive deforestation and malaria 
transmission in the China-Myanmar border area, the impact of deforestation on 
malaria vectors in the border area is unknown.
METHODS: We conducted life table studies on Anopheles minimus larvae to 
determine the pupation rate and development time in microcosms under deforested, 
banana plantation, and forested environments.
RESULTS: The pupation rate of An. minimus was 3.8 % in the forested environment. 
It was significantly increased to 12.5 % in banana plantations and to 52.5 % in 
the deforested area. Deforestation reduced larval-to-pupal development time by 
1.9-3.3 days. Food supplementation to aquatic habitats in forested environments 
and banana plantations significantly increased larval survival rate to a similar 
level as in the deforested environment.
CONCLUSION: Deforestation enhanced the survival and development of An. minimus 
larvae, a major malaria vector in the China-Myanmar border area. Experimental 
determination of the life table parameters on mosquito larvae under a variety of 
environmental conditions is valuable to model malaria transmission dynamics and 
impact by climate and environmental changes.

INTRODUCTION: Socioeconomic status (SES), which indicates one's access to 
financial, educational, and social resources, is a powerful determinant of 
health outcomes in multiple chronic diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an 
autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in a single gene. Although life 
expectancy and quality of life for patients with CF have improved exponentially, 
disease severity varies substantially, even among individuals with identical 
genotypes.
AREAS COVERED: CF disease progression and outcomes are influenced by a number of 
nongenetic factors, such as material well-being, educational attainment, living 
and working conditions, physical environment and exposures, family environment, 
social support, health behaviors, and health care. This review discusses 
pathways by which financial, educational, and social resources are translated 
into health advantages in CF. Expert commentary: To achieve equitable CF 
outcomes, the contribution of nongenetic factors must be emphasized, 
highlighting the mechanisms through which the social and physical environments 
influence disease variability.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the standardized incidence and 
mortality rate of colorectal cancer and its relationship with the human 
development index (HDI) across the world in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ecologic study was conducted for assessment of the 
correlation between age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) and age-specific 
mortality rate (ASMR) with HDI and its components. Data for SIR and SMR for 
every country for the year 2012 were obtained from the global cancer project. We 
used a bivariate method for assessment of the correlation between SIR and SMR 
and HDI. Statistical significance was assumed at <0.05. Statistical analyses 
were performed using SPSS (Version 22.0, SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS: Countries with the highest SIR of colorectal cancer in the world in 
2012, were Republic of Korea, Slovakia, Hungary and countries with the highest 
SMR were Hungary, Croatia and Slovakia. The correlation between SIR of 
colorectal cancer and the HDI was 0.712 (P≤0.001), with life expectancy at birth 
0.513 (P≤0.001), with mean years of schooling 0.641 (P≤0.001) and with level of 
income per each person of the population 0.514 (P=0.013). In addition, the 
correlation between SMR of colorectal cancer and the HDI was 0.628 (P≤0.001), 
with life expectancy at birth 0.469 (P≤0.001), with mean years of schooling 
0.592 (P≤0.001) and with level of income per each person of the population 0.378 
(P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The highest SIR and SMR of colorectal cancer was in the WHO Europe 
region. There was a positive correlation between HDI and SIR and SMR of 
colorectal cancer.

homeostasis.

Essential biological systems employ self-correcting mechanisms to maintain 
cellular homeostasis. Mammalian cell function is dynamically regulated by the 
interaction of cell surface galectins with branched N-glycans. Here we report 
that N-glycan branching deficiency triggers the Golgi to generate bioequivalent 
N-glycans that preserve galectin-glycoprotein interactions and cellular 
homeostasis. Galectins bind N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units within N-glycans 
initiated from UDP-GlcNAc by the medial-Golgi branching enzymes as well as the 
trans-Golgi poly-LacNAc extension enzyme β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 
(B3GNT). Marginally reducing LacNAc content by limiting N-glycans to three 
branches results in T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity; yet further 
restricting branching does not produce a more hyperactive state. Rather, new 
poly-LacNAc extension by B3GNT maintains galectin binding and immune 
homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by redistribution of unused 
UDP-GlcNAc from the medial to trans-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules. These 
data demonstrate the functional equivalency of structurally dissimilar N-glycans 
and suggest a self-correcting feature of the Golgi that sustains cellular 
homeostasis.

Modelling the Cost-Effectiveness of Delaying End-Stage Renal Disease.

Author information:
(1)Department of Nephrology and Einthoven Laboratory for Experimental Vascular 
Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: As the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is on the rise, 
new therapies are being developed for delaying ESRD. This study is aimed at 
constructing a generic model for estimating the cost-effectiveness of delaying 
ESRD in 7 European countries: the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, Finland and Hungary. The use of this model is illustrated by assessing 2 
fictitious, but realistic therapy options.
METHODS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs were estimated 
using a state-transition model. Age-dependent survival after renal replacement 
therapy was estimated using data from the Dutch Renal Registry. Healthcare costs 
and utilities were obtained from published reports. Country-specific differences 
regarding access to transplantation and value of productivity were factored.
RESULTS: A 1-year delay of ESRD rendered an estimated gain of 0.6 QALYs and 0.3 
years in productivity. Access to transplantation had a minimal impact, whereas 
savings on productivity had a significant impact. For a 1-year delay free of 
charge, societal savings would range from €8,000 in the United Kingdom to 
€17,000 in Germany. Applying thresholds of €20,000-€40,000 per QALY gained, 
one-time cell-based therapy would be economically acceptable if it delayed ESRD 
by 0.2-0.5 years. It would be cost saving for a delay in excess of 0.5 years. 
Continuous use of medication is unlikely to be cost-effective for prices higher 
than €30,000 per year.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the economic potential of new 
therapies delaying ESRD. The constructed model provides users with information 
about the market success rates of treatment options at an early stage.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation of a randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: Compare costs and cost-effectiveness of usual primary care management 
for patients with acute low back pain (LBP) with or without the addition of 
early physical therapy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low back pain is among the most common and costly 
conditions encountered in primary care. Early physical therapy after a new 
primary care consultation for acute LBP results in small clinical improvement 
but cost-effectiveness of a strategy of early physical therapy is unknown.
METHODS: Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized clinical trial 
of patients with acute, nonspecific LBP consulting a primary care provider. All 
patients received usual primary care management and education, and were randomly 
assigned to receive four sessions of physical therapy or usual care of delaying 
referral consideration to permit spontaneous recovery. Data were collected in a 
randomized trial involving 220 participants age 18 to 60 with LBP <16 days 
duration without red flags or signs of nerve root compression. The EuroQoL EQ-5D 
health states were collected at baseline and after 1-year and used to compute 
the quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Direct (health care utilization) 
and indirect (work absence or reduced productivity) costs related to LBP were 
collected monthly and valued using standard costs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was computed as incremental total costs divided by 
incremental QALYs.
RESULTS: Early physical therapy resulted in higher total 1-year costs (mean 
difference in adjusted total costs = $580, 95% CI: $175, $984, P = 0.005) and 
better quality of life (mean difference in QALYs = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.35, 
P = 0.008) after 1-year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $32,058 
(95% CI: $10,629, $151,161) per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Our results support early physical therapy as cost-effective 
relative to usual primary care after 1 year for patients with acute, nonspecific 
LBP.

OBJECTIVE: Long-term treatment with thiopurines is associated with a decreased 
risk of Crohn's disease (CD) flare but an increased risk of various cancers 
depending on gender, age, and presence of extensive colitis. We evaluated risks 
and benefits of withdrawing thiopurines in patients with CD in prolonged 
remission.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model assessing risks and benefits of withdrawing 
thiopurines compared to continuing thiopurines in a lifetime horizon. The model 
was stratified by age (35 and 65 years old at thiopurine withdrawal), gender and 
presence of extensive colitis. Parameter estimates were taken from French 
cohorts and hospital databases, cancer and death national registries and 
published literature. Life expectancy, rates of relapse, serious adverse events, 
and causes-of-death were evaluated.
RESULTS: In patients without extensive colitis, continuing thiopurines increased 
life expectancy up to 0.03 years for 35 year-old men and women but decreased 
life expectancy down to 0.07 years for 65 year-old men and women. Withdrawal 
strategy became the preferred strategy at 40.6 years for men, and 45.7 years for 
women without extensive colitis. In patients with extensive colitis, 
continuation strategy was the preferred strategy regardless of age. Risk-benefit 
analysis was not modified by duration of CD activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Factors determining life expectancy associated with withdrawal or 
continuation of thiopurines in patients with CD and in sustained clinical 
remission vary substantially according to gender, age and presence of extensive 
colitis. Individual decisions to continue or withdraw thiopurines in patients 
with CD in sustained remission should take into account these parameters.

BACKGROUND: There are many studies on the prognosis and mortality for the acute 
care of traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the first year. Prediction of the 
long-term outcome after TBI is more difficult, and can be ascribed to indistinct 
methods and the necessity of taking into account multiple influencing factors.
OBJECTIVE: The main factors that determine the long-term outcome of TBI are 
described.
MATERIALS AND METHODES: A summary of the relevant literature and experience of 
the reintegration of TBI patients are presented.
RESULTS: The major factors predicting the long-term outcome of TBI are 
well-known. They can be measured by International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health (ICF) of the World Health Organization and self-reported 
quality of life, which are important for the prognosis. Returning to work has a 
particularly positive effect on the quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors are most predictive of long-term TBI outcome. 
The awareness of the interaction of all these factors requires a individualized 
long-term rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is newly available for treatment 
of chronic hepatitis B patients in China. To date, no study has been conducted 
to examine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. The aim of this study was 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TDF versus four oral nucleos(t)ide analogs 
[lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), telbivudine (LdT), and entecavir (ETV)] and 
from a pharmacoeconomic perspective to assess current drug pricing for TDF.
METHODS: Based on Chinese healthcare perspectives, a Markov model was applied to 
simulate the lifetime (40-year time span) costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for five different monotherapy strategies. Two kinds of rescue 
combination strategies (base-case: LAM + ADV then ETV + ADV; alternative: 
directly using ETV + ADV) were separately considered for treatment of patients 
refractory to monotherapy. Model parameters (including disease transition, cost, 
and utility) were obtained from previous Chinese population studies. Both 
branded and generic drugs were separately analyzed. Study model uncertainties 
were assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Two-way 
sensitivity analysis was used to explore uncertainties between efficacy and 
price of TDF.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the lowest lifetime cost and the best 
cost-effectiveness ratio were obtained by ETV, which was considered the 
reference treatment. LAM, ADV, and LdT treatments had significantly greater 
costs and lower efficacies. Compared to ETV, TDF was more effective but also 
more expensive. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of TDF versus ETV were 
much higher than the willing-to-pay threshold of $20,466 US dollars (USD) per 
QALY gained (3 × gross domestic product per capita of China, 2014). TDF would be 
the most cost-effective strategy if the annual cost did not exceed $2260 USD and 
$1600 USD for branded and generic drugs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For Chinese chronic hepatitis B patients, ETV is still the most 
cost-effective strategy over TDF and other nucleos(t)ide analogs, with a 
threshold of $20,466 USD/QALY gained.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is highly 0conserved in eukaryotes and 
prokaryotes. Since its discovery in 1977, numerous studies established the 
TSPO's importance for life essential functions. For these studies, synthetic 
TSPO ligands typically are applied. Tetrapyrroles present endogenous ligands for 
the TSPO. Tetrapyrroles are also evolutionarily conserved and regulate multiple 
functions. TSPO and tetrapyrroles regulate each other. In animals 
TSPO-tetrapyrrole interactions range from effects on embryonic development to 
metabolism, programmed cell death, response to stress, injury and disease, and 
even to life span extension. In animals TSPOs are primarily located in 
mitochondria. In plants TSPOs are also present in plastids, the nuclear 
fraction, the endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi stacks. This may contribute to 
translocation of tetrapyrrole intermediates across organelles' membranes. As in 
animals, plant TSPO binds heme and protoporphyrin IX. TSPO-tetrapyrrole 
interactions in plants appear to relate to development as well as stress 
conditions, including salt tolerance, abscisic acid-induced stress, reactive 
oxygen species homeostasis, and finally cell death regulation. In bacteria, TSPO 
is important for switching from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, including the 
regulation of photosynthesis. As in mitochondria, in bacteria TSPO is located in 
the outer membrane. TSPO-tetrapyrrole interactions may be part of the 
establishment of the bacterial-eukaryote relationships, i.e., 
mitochondrial-eukaryote and plastid-plant endosymbiotic relationships.

We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of 
warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United Kingdom and 
Sweden. Data from EU-PACT, a randomized controlled trial in newly diagnosed AF 
patients, were used to model the incremental costs per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained by pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing versus 
standard treatment over a lifetime horizon. Incremental lifetime costs were £26 
and 382 Swedish kronor (SEK) and incremental QALYs were 0.0039 and 0.0015 in the 
United Kingdom and Sweden, respectively. The corresponding incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were £6 702 and 253 848 SEK per QALY gained. 
The ICER was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained 
in 93% of the simulations in the United Kingdom and below 500 000 SEK in 67% of 
the simulations in Sweden. Our data suggest that pharmacogenetic-guided dosing
