METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to compare 1) no intervention; 2) HCV 
screening and education (control); and 3) HCV screening, education, and care 
coordination (active linkage intervention). We also explored an alternative 
strategy wherein HCV/HIV co-infected participants linked elsewhere. Trial data 
include population characteristics (67% male, mean age 48, 58% HCV infected) and 
linkage rates. Data from published sources include treatment efficacy and HCV 
re-infection risk. We projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime 
medical costs using an established model of HCV (HEP-CE). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are in 2015 US$/QALY discounted 3% annually.
RESULTS: The control strategy resulted in a projected 35% linking to care within 
6 months and 31% achieving sustained virologic response (SVR). The intervention 
resulted in 60% linking and 54% achieving SVR with an ICER of $24,600/QALY 
compared to no intervention from the healthcare sector perspective and was a 
more efficient use of resources than the control strategy. The intervention had 
an ICER of $76,500/QALY compared to the alternative strategy. From a societal 
perspective, the intervention had a net monetary benefit of $511,000-$975,600.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV care coordination interventions that include screening, 
education and active linkage to care in MMT settings are likely cost-effective 
at a conventional $100,000/QALY threshold for both HCV mono-infected and HIV 
co-infected patients.

PURPOSE: To present ophthalmic patient time-tradeoff vision utilities for 
quantifying vision-related quality-of-life when the fellow eye still has good 
vision. These utilities are important for performing reliable cost-utility 
analyses.
DESIGN: Consecutive time-tradeoff vision utilities were obtained from ophthalmic 
patients with good vision (20/20-20/25) in one eye and vision ranging from 20/20 
to no light perception in the fellow eye over a 15-year period from 2000 
through 2014.
PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred eighty-six ophthalmic participant interviews from 
Wills Eye Hospital, New York Eye and Ear Hospital, and ophthalmology office 
practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
METHODS: Participants underwent a full ophthalmic examination, after which 
time-tradeoff vision utilities were obtained by personal interview by the 
authors using a standardized, validated instrument.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time-tradeoff vision utilities.
RESULTS: Mean time-tradeoff vision utilities were as follows in participants 
with good vision (20/20-20/25) in at least one eye and the following visions in 
the fellow eyes: no light perception, 0.79; counting fingers to light 
perception, 0.87; 20/200 to 20/400, 0.88; 20/60 to 20/100, 0.88; 20/30 to 20/50, 
0.87; and 20/20 to 20/25, 0.94.
CONCLUSIONS: In people with good vision (20/20-20/25) in one eye, the associated 
mean time-tradeoff vision utility is a remarkably consistent 0.87 to 0.88 when 
vision in the fellow eye ranges from 20/30 to light perception. Vision of 20/20 
to 20/25 in the fellow eye results in a significantly higher associated utility 
of 0.94 (P < 0.01), whereas vision of no light perception in the fellow eye 
results in a significantly lower utility of 0.079 (P < 0.01). These utilities 
are important for calculating reliable patient value (quality-adjusted 
life-year) gains in ophthalmic cost-utility analysis populations in which there 
is unilateral and bilateral disease involvement.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious complication of hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection. Sustained virologic response (SVR) for HCV is associated with a 
reduction in cirrhosis, HCC and mortality and their associated costs. Japanese 
HCV patients are older with higher prevalence of HCC. Here we used a 
decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the economic benefit of HCV cure by 
reducing HCC and DCC burden in Japan. A cohort of 10 000 HCV genotype 1b (GT1b) 
Japanese patients was modelled with a hybrid decision tree and Markov 
state-transition model capturing natural history of HCV over a lifetime horizon. 
Treatment options were approved all-oral direct-acting anti-virals (DAAs) vs no 
treatment. Treatment efficacy was based on clinical trials and transition rates 
and costs obtained from Japan-specific data. Cases of HCC, decompensated 
cirrhosis (DCC) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were projected for 
patients treated with DAAs vs NT. QALYs were monetized using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥4-to-¥6 million. Incremental savings with 
treatment were calculated by adding the projected cost of complications avoided 
to the monetized gains in QALYs. The model showed that DAA treatment vs no 
treatment, reduces 2057 cases of HCC and 1478 cases of decompensated cirrhosis 
and saves ¥850 446.73 and ¥338 229.90 per patient (ppt). Additionally, treatment 
can lead to additional 2.64 QALYs gained per patient. The indirect economic 
gains associated with treatment-related QALY improvements were ¥10 576 000, 
¥13 220 000 and ¥15 864 000 ppt (willingness-to-pay thresholds of ¥4 million, ¥5 
million and ¥6 million). Total economic savings of treatment with DAAs (vs no 
treatment) was ¥7 526 372.63, ¥10 170 372.63 and ¥12 814 372.63, at these 
different willingness-to-pay thresholds. In conclusion treatment of HCV GT1b 
with all-oral DAAs in Japan can lead to significant direct and indirect savings 
related to avoidance of HCC and DCC.

Diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus 
infection mean for the patient to be able to maintain working capacity, to 
increase quality of life, to prevent cancer, and to prolong life expectancy, 
while the society benefits from eliminating the chances of further transmission 
of the viruses, and decreasing the overall costs of serious complications. The 
guideline delineates the treatment algorithms from 22 September 2017 set by a 
consensus meeting of physicians involved in the treatment of these diseases. The 
prevalence of HBV infection in the Hungarian general population is 0,5-0,7%. The 
indications of treatment are based upon viral examinations (including viral 
nucleic acid determination), determinations of disease activity and stage 
(including biochemical, pathologic, and/or non-invasive methods), and excluding 
contraindications. To avoid unnecessary side effects and for a cost-effective 
approach, the guideline stresses the importance of quick and detailed virologic 
evaluations, the applicability of transient elastography as an acceptable 
alternative of liver biopsy in this regard as well as the relevance of 
appropriate consistent follow-up schedule for viral response during therapy. The 
first choice of therapy in chronic HBV infection can be pegylated interferon for 
48 weeks or continuous entecavir or tenofovir therapy. The latter two must be 
continued for at least 12 months after hepatitis B surface antigen 
seroconversion. Lamivudine is no longer the first choice; patients currently 
taking lamivudine must switch if the response is inadequate. Appropriate 
treatment of patients taking immunosuppressive medications is highly 
recommended. Pegylated interferon based therapy is recommended for the treatment 
of concomitant hepatitis D infection. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(Suppl 1): 24-37.

Hammertoe deformities are one of the most common foot deformities, affecting up 
to one third of the general population. Fusion of the joint can be achieved with 
various devices, with the current focus on percutaneous Kirschner (K)-wire 
fixation or commercial intramedullary implant devices. The purpose of the 
present study was to determine whether surgical intervention with percutaneous 
K-wire fixation versus commercial intramedullary implant is more cost effective 
for proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis in hammertoe surgery. A formal 
cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic tree model was conducted 
to investigate the healthcare costs and outcomes associated with either K-wire 
or commercial intramedullary implant fixation. The outcomes assessed included 
long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per 
QALY gained. Costs were evaluated from the healthcare system perspective and are 
expressed in U.S. dollars at a 2017 price base. Our results found that 
commercial implants were minimally more effective than K-wires but carried 
significantly higher costs. The total cost for treatment with percutaneous 
K-wire fixation was $5041 with an effectiveness of 0.82 QALY compared with a 
commercial implant cost of $6059 with an effectiveness of 0.83 QALY. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of commercial implants was $146,667. With 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of >$50,000, commercial implants failed 
to justify their proposed benefits to outweigh their cost compared to 
percutaneous K-wire fixation. In conclusion, percutaneous K-wire fixation would 
be preferred for arthrodesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint for 
hammertoes from a healthcare system perspective.

INTRODUCTION: Testicular tumors in children have two peaks with different types 
of tumors; in the first 4 years of life a third to half are benign with 
increased risk of malignancy during puberty. The pathology of testicular tumors 
between these peaks, at the age of 5-12 years, is not known. We hypothesized 
that because of the low level of testosterone at this time, the incidence of 
malignant tumors is very low.
OBJECTIVE: To compare malignancy risk of primary testicular tumors in children 
in the prepubertal period (5-12 years) compared with younger (0-4 years) and 
pubertal (13-18 years) children.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively (2002-2016) identified patients <18 years with 
surgery for primary testicular tumor. Patients with testicular tumor risk were 
excluded. Ultrasound studies were reviewed for contralateral testis volume, 
tumor morphology, and tumor maximal diameter, for three age groups: 0-4, 5-12, 
and 13-18 years. The Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability 
test was adopted for categorical outcomes, and one-way ANOVA for continuous 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (mean age 11.0 years, range 6 days-18 years) were 
identified. Malignant tumor prevalence significantly differed (p < 0.01) among 
age groups (Fig).: 0-4 (72.7%, 8/11), 5-12 (0%, 0/16), and 13-18 years (44.0%, 
11/25). The most common tumor types in 5-12 years were epidermoid cyst (31.3%, 
5/16) and tumor mimics (37.5%, 6/16). Prevalence of cystic tumors in 5-12 year 
olds was not significantly different compared with other age groups. 
Contralateral testicular volume >4 mL (pubertal surge) significantly (p < 0.01) 
differed among groups: 0-4 years (0/11), 5-12 years (3/16), and 13-18 years 
(19/20). In children aged 13-18 years the mean tumor maximal diameter 
(29.8 ± 4.4 mm) was significantly larger (p < 0.01) compared with children 5-12 
years (9.3 ± 5.5 mm) and all malignant tumors had contralateral testicular 
volume >4 mL.
DISCUSSION: We found that preadolescent children between the ages of 5 and 12 
years have distinctive characteristics compared with the other age groups. Most 
importantly, no malignant testicular tumors were found in this age group. About 
a third of the children presented with an incidental testicular mass. The 
testicular tumors were significantly smaller (9.3 ± 6.7 mm) compared with those 
in children aged 13-18 years (29.8 ± 4.4 mm). There were limitations because of 
the retrospective nature of the study.
CONCLUSION: We found no malignant testicular tumors in children aged 5-12 years 
with no risk factors and prior to pubertal surge. Our study suggests use of more 
conservative treatment in this group of patients.

A decline in female reproduction is one of the earliest hallmarks of aging in 
many animals, including invertebrates and mammals [1-4]. The 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) pathway has a conserved 
role in regulating longevity [5] and also controls reproductive aging [2, 6]. 
Although IIS transcriptional targets that regulate somatic aging have been 
characterized [7, 8], it was not known whether the same mechanisms influence 
reproductive aging. We previously showed that Caenorhabditis elegans daf-2 IIS 
receptor mutants extend reproductive span by maintaining oocyte quality with age 
[6], but IIS targets in oocytes had not been identified. Here, we compared the 
transcriptomes of aged daf-2(-) and wild-type oocytes, and distinguished IIS 
targets in oocytes from soma-specific targets. Remarkably, IIS appears to 
regulate reproductive and somatic aging through largely distinct mechanisms, 
although the binding motif for longevity factor PQM-1 [8] was also 
overrepresented in oocyte targets. Reduction of oocyte-specific IIS targets 
decreased reproductive span extension and oocyte viability of daf-2(-) worms, 
and pqm-1 is required for daf-2(-)'s long reproductive span. Cathepsin-B-like 
gene expression and activity levels were reduced in aged daf-2(-) oocytes, and 
RNAi against cathepsin-B-like W07B8.4 improved oocyte quality maintenance and 
extended reproductive span. Importantly, adult-only pharmacological inhibition 
of cathepsin B proteases reduced age-dependent deterioration in oocyte quality, 
even when treatment was initiated in mid-reproduction. This suggests that it is 
possible to pharmacologically slow age-related reproductive decline through 
mid-life intervention. Oocyte-specific IIS target genes thereby revealed 
potential therapeutic targets for maintaining reproductive health with age.

Elderly care is an emerging global issue threatening both developed and 
developing countries. The elderly in Japan increased to 26.7% of the population 
in 2015, and Japan is classified as a super-aged society. In this article, we 
introduce the financial aspects of the medical care and welfare services policy 
for the elderly in Japan. Japan's universal health insurance coverage system has 
been in place since 1961. Long-term care includes welfare services, which were 
separated from the medical care insurance scheme in 2000 when Japan was already 
recognized as an aging society. Since then, the percentage of the population 
over 65 has increased dramatically, with the productive-age population on the 
decrease. The Japanese government, therefore, is seeking to implement "The 
Community-based Integrated Care System" with the aim of building comprehensive 
up-to-the-end-of-life support services in each community. The system has four 
proposed elements: self-help (Ji-jo), mutual aid (Go-jo), social solidarity care 
(Kyo-jo), and government care (Ko-jo). From the financial perspective, as the 
government struggles against the financial burdens of an aging population, they 
are considering self-help and mutual aid. Based on Japan's present situation, 
both elements could lead to positive results. The Japanese government must also 
entrust the responsibility for implementing preventive support to municipalities 
through strongly required regional autonomy. As Japan has resolved this new 
challenge through several discussions over a long period of time, other aging 
countries could learn from the Japanese experience of solving barriers to 
healthcare policy for the elderly.

In this paper, we analyse the effect of an onset of a health shock on subjective 
survival probability and compare it with objective survival probability and 
self-reported health measures. In particular, we are interested in whether 
expectations of people respond to health shocks and whether these follow the 
evolution of objective life expectations and self-reported health measures over 
time. Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we estimate 
fixed effects models of adaptation for the objective and subjective survival 
probabilities and for some self-reported health measures. The results show that 
after cancer diagnosis, conditional on surviving, both the objective and 
subjective longevity and self-reported health measures drift back to the before 
diagnosis trajectories. For stroke and heart attack, in spite of their 
persistent negative effect on survival, subjective life expectations and 
self-reported health measures seem to indicate only a transient effect of the 
health shock. The differences between the objective and subjective measures are 
in line with the concept of adaptation. We discuss the policy implications of 
our results.

important public health issues. This study investigates the association between 
socioeconomic position (SEP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) stage at diagnosis and 
survival in Switzerland, a European country with highest level of medical 
facilities and life expectancy. We used population-based CRC data from seven 
Swiss cantonal cancer registries 2001-2008 (N = 10,088) linked to the Swiss 
National Cohort (SNC). Follow-up information was available until the end of 
2013. SEP was estimated based on education. The association between cancer stage 
and SEP was assessed using logistic regression models including cancer 
localization (colon/rectum), sex, age, civil status, urbanity of residence, 
language region, and nationality (Swiss/non-Swiss). Survival was analyzed using 
competing risk regressions reporting subhazard ratios (SHRs) for the risk of 
dying due to CRC. We observed a social gradient for later stage CRC with 
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97-1.19) and 1.28 (95% CI: 
1.08-1.50) for middle and low SEP compared to high SEP. Further, single compared 
to married people had elevated odds of being diagnosed at later stages. Survival 
was lower in patients with CRC with low SEP in the unadjusted model (SHR: 1.18, 
95% CI: 1.07-1.30). After adjustment for stage at diagnosis and further 
sociodemographic characteristics, significant survival inequalities by SEP 
disappeared but remained for non-Swiss compared to Swiss citizens and for 
patients living in nonurban areas compared to their urban counterparts. Swiss 
public health strategies should facilitate equal access to CRC screening and 
optimal CRC care for all social groups and in all regions of Switzerland.

Neuroendocrine tumors detected in appendectomy specimens: ten-year single-center 
experience.

Şenel F, Karaman H, Demir H.

Background/aim: The aim of this study was to investigate neuroendocrine tumors 
(NETs) detected in appendectomy specimens and the incidence and 
clinicopathologic characteristics of these tumors in our center. Materials and 
methods: A total of 13,863 patients were evaluated retrospectively. All 
underwent appendectomy operation in the Kayseri Training and Research Hospital 
and had a histopathological examination at the Pathology Clinic between January 
2007 and March 2017. Age, sex, preoperative clinical findings, operation 
procedure, and histopathological examination results of the cases reported to be 
NET are presented. Results: NET was detected in 29 cases (0.2%) in the 
histopathological examination of 13,863 appendectomy specimens. Of these, 26 
were classical carcinoid tumors and 3 were goblet cell carcinoid tumors (GCCTs). 
For the NET cases, the mean age was 37 years and the male to female ratio was 
1.07. Only 68.9% of the patients underwent an appendectomy, and 31% of the 
patients underwent a secondary right hemicolectomy. Recurrences were not 
detected in any of the cases. In the present study, coincidence was determined 
in all of the cases with NET in the appendix. Conclusion: Contrary to many 
studies, both NETs of the appendix and GCCT cases were slightly higher among 
males and advanced age groups in this study. The long-term life expectancy in 
cases of classical carcinoid tumors of the appendix is quite good.

The increased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in severe mental 
illness (SMI) contributes to increased cardiovascular morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy for people with SMI. Areas covered: In the present clinical review, 
we summarize the efficacy, safety and tolerability of selected diabetic 
pharmacotherapy options in SMI and discuss the quality and strength of evidence. 
Expert commentary: General principles for treating T2DM in SMI involve 
identifying treatments which promote weight loss and which have low or no risk 
of hypoglycemia. Patient engagement in decision making about treatment choices 
is an important factor to ensure adherence and successful use of the chosen 
therapy. The first line therapeutic option for T2DM in SMI for which there is 
most evidence is metformin. Based on general population data, second line 
treatment options in combination with metformin to achieve glycated haemoglobin 
treatment goals include GLP-1R agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulphonylureas, SGLT2 
inhibitors, pioglitazone and insulin, with most evidence for the use of GLP-1R 
agonists in SMI. Alongside efficacy and tolerability, treatment for T2DM in SMI 
should be considered on a patient-tailored basis.

BACKGROUND: Decrease in coercive measures can lead to increased exposure to 
antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. This is not desirable as these drugs are 
associated with harmful side effects and reduced life expectancy.
AIM: To quantify and compare the use of antipsychotic and anxiolytic medications 
in connection with the implementation of a programme to reduce coercion and 
restraint.
METHODS: Observational study in a general psychiatric ward comparing 
psychopharmacological treatment after implementation of non-pharmacological 
interventions to reduce coercion and mechanical restraint with a historical 
reference cohort from the same ward.
RESULTS: Data from 101 admissions after implementation of interventions were 
compared with data from 85 admissions in a historical reference cohort. Mean 
defined daily doses of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or the total amount of 
both showed no difference before and after implementation of the programme. 
Standardised regression coefficients (β) from a mixed effects linear regression 
model, adjusted for age, gender, length of admission, involuntary admission and 
history of substance abuse showed that neither total dose of antipsychotics 
(adjusted β: .05, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.20 to 0.31), total dose of 
benzodiazepines (adjusted β: -.13, 95%CI: -.42 to 0.16) nor total amount of both 
drugs (adjusted β: .00, 95%CI: -.26 to 0.21) increased after implementation.
CONCLUSION: Decrease in coercive measures from 2013 to 2016 has not lead to 
significant increases in the use of antipsychotic medication or benzodiazepines. 
The interventions are useful in establishing restraint-free wards, and careful 
monitoring of the psychopharmacological treatment is important for patient 
safety.

OBJECTIVE: A large, pivotal, phase 3 trial in patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma (MM) demonstrated that denosumab, compared with zoledronic 
acid, was non-inferior for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs), 
extended the observed median progression-free survival (PFS) by 10.7 months, and 
showed significantly less renal toxicity. The cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs 
zoledronic acid in MM in the US was assessed from societal and payer 
perspectives.
METHODS: The XGEVA Global Economic Model was developed by integrating data from 
the phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with zoledronic acid for 
the prevention of SREs in MM. SRE rates were adjusted to reflect the real-world 
incidence. The model included utility decrements for SREs, administration, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and disease progression. Drug, administration, 
SRE management, SAEs, and anti-MM treatment costs were based on data from 
published studies. For the societal perspective, the model additionally included 
SRE-related direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The net monetary 
benefit (NMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000. 
One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, the use of 
denosumab resulted in an incremental cost of US$26,329 and an incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.2439, translating into a cost per QALY 
gained of US$107,939 and a NMB of US$10,259 in favor of denosumab. Results were 
sensitive to SRE rates and PFS parameters.
LIMITATIONS: Costs were estimated from multiple sources, which varied by tumor 
type, patient population, country, and other parameters. PFS and overall 
survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using 
fitted parametric curves.
CONCLUSION: Denosumab's efficacy in delaying or preventing SREs, potential to 
improve PFS, and lack of renal toxicity make it a cost-effective option for the 
prevention of SREs in MM compared with zoledronic acid.

BACKGROUND: The literature offers discrepant findings regarding age at death in 
individuals with Huntington disease (HD).
OBJECTIVE: To study the age at death and causes of death in males and females 
with a diagnosis of HD in Norway.
METHODS: Registry study of deaths in 1986-2015 using data from two national 
registries: the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry (NCDR) and the registry of the 
Centre for Rare Disorders (CRD), Oslo University Hospital.
RESULTS: Mean age at death for individuals with HD was found to be 63.9 years 
(NCDR) and 61.7 years (CRD), compared to a mean of 76.9 years in the general 
population (NCDR). There were no significant gender differences for age at death 
in individuals with HD. The significant increase in age at death within the 
general population from 1986 to 2015 was not observed in individuals with HD. In 
73.5% of individuals with HD, the underlying cause of death was HD, followed by 
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases. The most common 
immediate cause of death was respiratory diseases (44.2%). Suicide was a more 
common cause of death in the population with HD (2.3%) compared to the general 
population (1.3%).
CONCLUSION: The age at death of individuals with HD was stable over a period of 
30 years and 13.3 years lower than in the general population. Longer life 
expectancy for females from the general population was not found in females with 
HD. Suicide was more common among individuals with HD compared to the general 
population.

PURPOSE: This article summarizes relevant findings related to low back and neck 
pain from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) reports for the purpose of 
informing the Global Spine Care Initiative.
METHODS: We reviewed and summarized back and neck pain burden data from two 
studies that were published in Lancet in 2016, namely: "Global, regional, and 
national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases 
and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2015" and "Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for 315 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE), 
1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015."
RESULTS: In 2015, low back and neck pain were ranked the fourth leading cause of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally just after ischemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infection {low back and 
neck pain DALYs [thousands]: 94 941.5 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 67 
745.5-128 118.6]}. In 2015, over half a billion people worldwide had low back 
pain and more than a third of a billion had neck pain of more than 3 months 
duration. Low back and neck pain are the leading causes of years lived with 
disability in most countries and age groups.
CONCLUSION: Low back and neck pain prevalence and disability have increased 
markedly over the past 25 years and will likely increase further with population 
aging. Spinal disorders should be prioritized for research funding given the 
huge and growing global burden. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic 
Supplementary Material.

As part of its single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company that manufactures 
ponatinib (Inclusig®; Incyte Corporation) to submit evidence for the clinical 
and cost effectiveness for previously treated chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 
and Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL). 
This paper focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the 
accelerated phase (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and 
Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was 
commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article 
presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the 
outcome of the NICE guidance. Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a 
phase II, industry-sponsored, single-arm, open-label, multicentre, 
non-comparative study. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, 
this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment 
(in terms of major cytogenetic response and major haematological response) with 
an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML. Given the absence of any 
head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other relevant comparators, the 
company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of ponatinib 
with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with CP-CML because 
comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to allow the 
matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC approach, 
ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the 
third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company 
developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of 
ponatinib for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or 
BP-CML, which were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore 
the uncertainty in the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the 
uncertainty in the decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses 
undertaken by the ERG produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, 
from £18,246 to £27,667 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared 
with best supportive care (BSC), from £19,680 to £37,381 per QALY gained 
compared with bosutinib and from £18,279 per QALY gained to dominated compared 
with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). In AP-CML, the cost per QALY 
gained for ponatinib ranged from £7123 to £17,625 compared with BSC, and from 
dominating to £61,896 per QALY gained compared with allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the 
cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from £5033 per QALY gained to dominated 
compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more favourable end 
of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The NICE 
appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS 
resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the 
agreed discount in the Patient Access Scheme.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence invited Eli Lilly and 
Company Ltd, the company manufacturing ixekizumab (tradename Taltz®), to submit 
evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of ixekizumab. Ixekizumab was 
compared with tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, 
adalimumab), ustekinumab, secukinumab, best supportive care and, if 
non-biological treatment or phototherapy is suitable, also compared with 
systemic non-biological therapies and phototherapy with ultraviolet B radiation 
for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews 
Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was 
commissioned as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents a 
summary of the company submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the 
development of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance 
for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee. The 
Evidence Review Group produced a critical review of the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of ixekizumab based on the company submission. The company 
submission presented three randomised controlled trials identified in a 
systematic review. All randomised controlled trials were phase III, multicentre 
placebo-controlled trials including 3866 participants with moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis. Two trials also included an active comparator (etanercept). All 
randomised controlled trials showed statistically significant increases in two 
primary outcomes, static Physician Global Assessment (0,1) and improvement of 
75% from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Ixekizumab was 
generally well tolerated in the randomised controlled trials, with similar 
discontinuation rates because of adverse events as placebo or etanercept. The 
most frequent adverse events of special interest were infections and 
injection-site reactions. The company submission also included a network 
meta-analysis of relevant comparators. The Evidence Review Group highlighted 
some issues regarding the systematic review process and an issue with the 
generalisability of the findings in that the trials failed to include patients 
with moderate psoriasis according to a widely used definition. This issue was 
considered by the Appraisal Committee and the population was deemed 
generalisable to patients in England and Wales. Based on the network 
meta-analysis, the Appraisal Committee concluded that ixekizumab was more 
clinically effective than adalimumab and ustekinumab, and agreed it was likely 
that ixekizumab was similarly effective compared with secukinumab and infliximab 
while tolerability was similar to other biological treatments approved for 
treating psoriasis. The Evidence Review Group's critical assessment of the 
company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (1) 
the use of relative outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response 
to model the cost effectiveness; (2) the exclusion of the consequences of 
adverse events; (3) the assumption of no utility gain in the induction phase; 
(4) equal annual discontinuation rates for all treatments; (5) the selection of 
treatment sequences for consideration in the analyses and; (6) the transparency 
of the Visual Basic for Applications code used to develop the model. Although 
some of these issues were adjusted in the Evidence Review Group base case, the 
Evidence Review Group could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and 
thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the 
cost-effectiveness evidence. In the Evidence Review Group base-case incremental 
analysis, the treatment sequence incorporating ixekizumab in the second line has 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £25,532 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained vs. the etanercept sequence. Ixekizumab in the first-line 
sequence has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £39,129 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with the treatment sequence 
incorporating ixekizumab in the second line. Consistent with its conclusion 
regarding clinical effectiveness, the Appraisal Committee concluded that the 
cost effectiveness of ixekizumab for treating moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis was similar to that of other biological treatments, already 
recommended in previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidance. The committee concluded that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was within the range that could be considered a cost-effective use of National 
Health Service resources.
