AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
dapagliflozin (Forxiga(®)) added to metformin, compared with sulfonylurea (SU) 
added to metformin, in Nordic Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients 
inadequately controlled on metformin.
METHODS: Data from a 52-week clinical trial comparing dapagliflozin and SU in 
combination with metformin was used in a Cardiff simulation model to estimate 
long term diabetes-related complications in a cohort of T2DM patients. Costs and 
QALYs were calculated from a healthcare provider perspective and estimated over 
a patient's lifetime.
RESULTS: Compared with metformin+SU, the cost per QALY gained with 
dapagliflozin+metformin was €7944 in Denmark, €5424 in Finland, €4769 in Norway, 
and €6093 in Sweden. Metformin+dapagliflozin was associated with QALY gains 
ranging from 0.236 in Norway to 0.278 in Sweden and incremental cost ranging 
from €1125 in Norway to €1962 in Denmark. Results were robust across both 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results were driven by weight 
changes associated with each treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that metformin+dapagliflozin is associated with 
gains in QALY compared with metformin+SU in Nordic T2DM patients inadequately 
controlled on metformin. Dapagliflozin treatment is a cost-effective treatment 
alternative for Type 2 diabetes in all four Nordic countries.

Assembly of transmembrane domains (TMDs) is a critical step in the function of 
membrane proteins. In recent years, the role of specific amino acids in TMD-TMD 
interactions has been better characterized, with more emphasis on polar and 
aromatic residues. Despite the high abundance of proline residues in TMDs, 
contribution of proline to TMD-TMD association has not been intensively studied. 
Here, we evaluated statistically the frequency of appearance, and experimentally 
the contribution of proline, compared to other hydrophobic amino acids (Gly, 
Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, and Met), with regard to TMD-TMD self-assembly. Our model 
system is the assembly motif ((22)QxxS(25)) found previously in TMDs of the 
Escherichia coli aspartate receptor (Tar-1). Statistically, our data revealed 
that all different motifs, except PxxS (P/S), have frequencies similar to their 
theoretical random expectancy within a database of 41916 sequences of TMDs, 
while PxxS motif is underrepresented. Experimentally, using the ToxR assembly 
system, the SDS-gel running pattern of biotin-conjugated TMD peptides, and FRET 
experiments between fluorescence-labeled peptides, we found that only the P/S 
motif preserves the dimerization ability of wild-type Tar-1 TMD. Although 
proline is known as a helix breaker in solution, Circular Dichroism spectroscopy 
revealed that the secondary structure of the P/S and the wild-type peptides are 
similar. All together, these data suggest that proline can stabilize TM 
self-assembly when localized to the interaction interface of a transmembrane 
oligomer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Interfacially Active 
Peptides and Proteins. Guest Editors: William C. Wimley and Kalina Hristova.

Routine echocardiography screening for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction 
in childhood cancer survivors: a model-based estimation of the clinical and 
economic effects.

Yeh JM, Nohria A, Diller L.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2014 May 20;160(10):731-2.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors treated with cardiotoxic therapies are 
recommended to have routine cardiac assessment every 1 to 5 years, but the 
long-term benefits are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine cardiac assessment to 
detect asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor and β-blocker treatment to reduce congestive heart failure 
(CHF) incidence in childhood cancer survivors.
DESIGN: Simulation model.
DATA SOURCES: Literature, including data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor 
Study.
TARGET POPULATION: Childhood cancer survivors.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Interval-based echocardiography assessment every 1, 2, 5, or 10 
years, with subsequent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or β-blocker 
treatment for patients with positive test results.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime risk for systolic CHF, lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The lifetime risk for systolic CHF among 5-year 
childhood cancer survivors aged 15 years was 18.8% without routine cardiac 
assessment (average age at onset, 58.8 years). Routine echocardiography reduced 
lifetime risk for CHF by 2.3% (with assessment every 10 years) to 8.7% (annual 
assessment). The ICER for assessment every 10 years was $111 600 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with no assessment. Assessment every 
5 years had an ICER of $117 900 per QALY, and ICERs for more frequent assessment 
exceeded $165 000 per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to treatment 
effectiveness, absolute excess risk for CHF, and asymptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction asymptomatic period. The probability that assessment every 10 or 5 
years was preferred at a $100 000-per-QALY threshold was 0.33 for the overall 
cohort.
LIMITATION: Treatment effectiveness was based on adult data.
CONCLUSION: Current recommendations for cardiac assessment may reduce CHF 
incidence, but less frequent assessment may be preferable.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines are at high 
risk for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD), subsequent heart 
failure, and death. The consensus-based Children's Oncology Group (COG) 
Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines recommend lifetime echocardiographic screening 
for ALVD.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the COG guidelines 
and to identify more cost-effective screening strategies.
DESIGN: Simulation of life histories using Markov health states.
DATA SOURCES: Childhood Cancer Survivor Study; published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Childhood cancer survivors.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Echocardiographic screening followed by angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and β-blocker therapies after ALVD diagnosis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in dollars per QALY, and cumulative incidence 
of heart failure.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The COG guidelines versus no screening have an 
ICER of $61 500, extend life expectancy by 6 months and QALYs by 1.6 months, and 
reduce the cumulative incidence of heart failure by 18% at 30 years after cancer 
diagnosis. However, less frequent screenings are more cost-effective than the 
guidelines and maintain 80% of the health benefits.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER was most sensitive to the magnitude of 
ALVD treatment efficacy; higher treatment efficacy resulted in lower ICER.
LIMITATION: Lifetime non-heart failure mortality and the cumulative incidence of 
heart failure more than 20 years after diagnosis were extrapolated; the efficacy 
of ACE inhibitor and β-blocker therapy in childhood cancer survivors with ALVD 
is undetermined (or unknown).
CONCLUSION: The COG guidelines could reduce the risk for heart failure in 
survivors at less than $100 000/QALY. Less frequent screening achieves most of 
the benefits and would be more cost-effective than the COG guidelines.

BACKGROUND: As highly effective hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies emerge, data 
are needed to inform the development of interventions to improve HCV treatment 
rates. We used simulation modeling to estimate the impact of loss to follow-up 
on HCV treatment outcomes and to identify intervention strategies likely to 
provide good value for the resources invested in them.
METHODS: We used a Monte Carlo state-transition model to simulate a hypothetical 
cohort of chronically HCV-infected individuals recently screened positive for 
serum HCV antibody. We simulated four hypothetical intervention strategies 
(linkage to care; treatment initiation; integrated case management; peer 
navigator) to improve HCV treatment rates, varying efficacies and costs, and 
identified strategies that would most likely result in the best value for the 
resources required for implementation.
MAIN MEASURES: Sustained virologic responses (SVRs), life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), costs from health system and program 
implementation perspectives, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: We estimate that imperfect follow-up reduces the real-world 
effectiveness of HCV therapies by approximately 75%. In the base case, a 
modestly effective hypothetical peer navigator program maximized the number of 
SVRs and QALE, with an ICER compared to the next best intervention of 
$48,700/quality-adjusted life year. Hypothetical interventions that 
simultaneously addressed multiple points along the cascade provided better 
outcomes and more value for money than less costly interventions targeting 
single steps. The 5-year program cost of the hypothetical peer navigator 
intervention was $14.5 million per 10,000 newly diagnosed individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that imperfect follow-up during the HCV cascade of care 
greatly reduces the real-world effectiveness of HCV therapy. Our mathematical 
model shows that modestly effective interventions to improve follow-up would 
likely be cost-effective. Priority should be given to developing and evaluating 
interventions addressing multiple points along the cascade rather than options 
focusing solely on single points.

The Nearctic genus Prostoia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) is reviewed. Prostoia 
ozarkensis sp. n. is described from the male and female adult stages mainly from 
the Interior Highland region encompassing portions of Arkansas, Missouri, and 
Oklahoma. Prostoia ozarkensis sp. n. appears most closely related to two 
species, one distributed broadly across the western Nearctic region, P. 
besametsa (Ricker), and one found widely throughout the central and eastern 
Nearctic regions, P. completa (Walker). A surprising range extension is noted 
for P. hallasi Kondratieff & Kirchner, a species once known only from the Great 
Dismal Swamp, from small upland streams in southern Illinois. Additional new 
state records are documented for P. besametsa, P. completa, P. hallasi and P. 
similis (Hagen). Taxonomic keys to Prostoia males and females are provided, and 
scanning electron micrographs of adult genitalia of all species are given.

We collated and analysed data from hospital records regarding the cause of death 
of 18,385 patients with diabetes who died in 282 medical institutions throughout 
Japan over the 10-year period between 1991 and 2000. Autopsy was carried out in 
1750 cases. The most frequent cause of death in all 18,385 cases was malignant 
neoplasia, accounting for 34.1% of cases, followed by vascular diseases 
(including diabetic nephropathy, ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular 
diseases) in 26.8%, infections in 14.3%, and then diabetic coma in 1.2%. The 
most common malignancy was liver cancer, accounting for 8.6% of all the deaths. 
Of the deaths from vascular diseases, diabetic nephropathy was the cause of 
death in 6.8% of cases, and the frequency as cause of death for ischemic heart 
diseases and cerebrovascular diseases were similar at 10.2% and 9.8%, 
respectively. Myocardial infarction accounted for almost all the deaths from 
ischemic heart diseases, whereas deaths from cerebral infarction were 2.2-fold 
as common as those from cerebral hemorrhage. In the analyses of the relationship 
between age and causes of death in diabetic patients who underwent autopsy, the 
overall mortality rate as a result of vascular diseases increased with age, 
although the mortality rates from diabetic nephropathy and cerebrovascular 
diseases increased little from the fifth decade of life. The mortality rate from 
ischemic heart diseases increased with age, however, and was higher than the 
other forms of vascular diseases from the sixth decade of life, accounting for 
approximately 50% of vascular deaths in the eighth decade. Malignant neoplasia 
was the most frequent cause of death from the fifth decade of life, and was 
extremely common in the seventh decade, accounting for 46.3% of all the deaths. 
The mortality rate from infections varied little between age groups from the 
fifth decade of life. In the analyses of glycemic control and the age at the 
time of death, lifespans were 2.5 years shorter in males, and 1.6 years shorter 
in female diabetics with poor glycemic control than in those with good or fair 
glycemic control. This difference was greater for deaths as a result of 
infections and vascular diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy, than for 
malignant neoplasia. Analysis of the relationship between glycemic control and 
the duration of diabetes and deaths as a result of vascular diseases showed no 
correlation between the level of glycemic control and death from diabetic 
nephropathy, ischemic heart diseases or cerebrovascular diseases. In diabetics 
with disease durations of less than 10 years, the mortality rate from 
macroangiopathy was higher than that as a result of diabetic nephropathy, a form 
of microangiopathy. Treatment for diabetes comprised of diet alone in 21.5%, 
oral hypoglycemic agents in 29.5%, and insulin with or without oral hypoglycemic 
agents in 44.2%, which was the most common. In particular, 683/1170 (58.4%) 
diabetics who died from diabetic nephropathy were on insulin therapy, a higher 
proportion than the 661/1687 (39.2%) who died from ischemic heart diseases, or 
the 659/1622 (40.6%) who died from cerebrovascular diseases. The average age at 
the time of death in the survey population was, 68 years for males and 
71.6 years for females. These were 9.6 and 13 years, respectively, short of the 
average life expectancy for the Japanese general population. In comparison with 
the previous survey (1981-1990), the average age at the time of death had 
increased 1.5 years for males, and 3.2 years for females. The average life 
expectancy for the Japanese general population had also increased 1.7 and 
2.7 years, respectively, over that period, showing that advances in the 
management and treatment of diabetes have not led to any improvement in 
patients' life expectancies. (J Diabetes Invest, doi:

Aims/Introduction:  The objective of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of administering voglibose, in addition to standard care of 
diet and exercise, compared with standard care alone for high-risk Japanese 
patients with impaired glucose tolerance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:   A Markov model was constructed to estimate the 
long-term prognosis of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, in terms of 
expected medical costs and life expectancy. Transition probabilities were 
derived from the results of a clinical trial of voglibose, as well as the 
epidemiological information. Effectiveness was evaluated by life expectancy and 
only direct costs were considered. The future costs and effectiveness were 
discounted by 3% per year.
RESULTS:   Estimated expected lifetime costs for the voglibose administration 
group and the standard care group was JPY718,724 ($US7598) and JPY1,365,405 
($US14,433), respectively, with voglibose administration resulting in saving of 
JPY646,681 ($US6836). Estimated life expectancy was 18.672 and 18.073 years, 
respectively, with life expectancy prolonged by 0.599 years when voglibose was 
administered together with the standard care.
CONCLUSIONS:   In order to prevent type 2 diabetes among Japanese patients with 
impaired glucose tolerance, voglibose with standard care resulted in 
cost-saving, as well as prolongation of life expectancy, compared with standard 
care alone. (J Diabetes Invest, doi: 10.1111/j.2040-1124.2010.0052.x, 2010).

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: An initial 26-week, randomized, open-label study compared the 
efficacy and safety of exenatide 10 mcg twice daily with exenatide 2 mg once 
weekly in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes who experienced inadequate 
glycemic control with oral antidiabetes medications. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate the safety of exenatide once weekly in Japanese patients, a subset 
of the initial patient population, who continued into this extension study for 
an additional 26 weeks of therapy on exenatide once weekly, followed by 10 weeks 
without exenatide once weekly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese patients initially assigned to exenatide twice 
daily (n = 62) switched to exenatide once weekly for the extended 26 weeks, and 
patients initially assigned to exenatide once weekly (n = 74) continued on this 
regimen for the remainder of the study (total treatment of 52 weeks).
RESULTS: A total of 68% of patients reported one or more treatment-emergent 
adverse events during the extension period; the most common of these were 
nasopharyngitis (14%) and vomiting (6%). No major hypoglycemic episodes were 
reported. Improvements in glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose and 
postprandial glucose were maintained over 52 weeks of treatment. At week 52, 
bodyweight remained reduced from baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide once weekly added to oral antidiabetes medication was 
well tolerated in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, and was associated 
with glycemic control and weight loss through to 52 weeks, supporting the use of 
exenatide once weekly as an adjunctive treatment for type 2 diabetes in this 
patient population. The initial 26-week portion of this trial was registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT00917267).

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use causes high burden of disease and injury globally. 
Switzerland has a high consumption of alcohol, almost twice the global average. 
Alcohol-attributable deaths and years of life lost in Switzerland were estimated 
by age and sex for the year 2011. Additionally, the impact of heavy drinking 
(40+grams/day for women and 60+g/day for men) was estimated.
METHODS: Alcohol consumption estimates were based on the Addiction Monitoring in 
Switzerland study and were adjusted to per capita consumption based on sales 
data. Mortality data were taken from the Swiss mortality register. Methodology 
of the Comparative Risk Assessment for alcohol was used to estimate 
alcohol-attributable fractions.
RESULTS: Alcohol use caused 1,600 (95% CI: 1,472 - 1,728) net deaths (1,768 
deaths caused, 168 deaths prevented) among 15 to 74 year olds, corresponding to 
8.7% of all deaths (men: 1,181 deaths; women: 419 deaths). Overall, 42,627 years 
of life (9.7%, 95% CI: 40,245 - 45,008) were lost due to alcohol. Main causes of 
alcohol-attributable mortality were injuries at younger ages (15-34 years), with 
increasing age digestive diseases (mainly liver cirrhosis) and cancers 
(particularly breast cancers among women). The majority (62%) of all 
alcohol-attributable deaths was caused by chronic heavy drinking (men: 67%; 
women: 48 %).
CONCLUSION: Alcohol is a major cause of premature mortality in Switzerland. Its 
impact, among young people mainly via injuries, among men mainly through heavy 
drinking, calls for a mix of preventive actions targeting chronic heavy 
drinking, binge drinking and mean consumption.

Improving maternal health in Kenya: Challenges and strategies for low resource 
nations.

Kagia J(1).

In order to improve maternal health in low-resource countries, a multifaceted, 
culturally and religiously sensitive approach is needed. This approach includes 
working for political stability, increasing women's level of education, economic 
empowerment, strengthening existing health management systems, and wisely 
allocating human and material resources. Critically important material resources 
such as access to and production of food and clean water must be a top priority. 
In Kenya, our constitution respects life from conception as an individual's 
right. This means that there is need to set up strategies that improve maternal 
health and by extension improve the health of the unborn baby.

Managing chronic pain effectively is often challenging for health care providers 
and patients. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve 
patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has 
previously been unavailable. This paper describes the development and evaluation 
of a telehealth intervention (TelePain) designed to address the need for pain 
specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in 
non-academic medical centers. We describe the theoretical foundation and 
development of a multifaceted intervention using a cluster randomized clinical 
trial design. Health care providers and their patients with chronic pain are 
enrolled in the study. Patient participants receive the intervention (report of 
symptoms and receipt of a pain graph) weekly for 8 weeks and are contacted at 12 
weeks for completion of post-intervention follow-up measures. Their providers 
attend TelePain sessions which involve a didactic presentation on an 
evidence-based topic related to pain management followed by patient case 
presentations and discussion by community clinicians. Symptom management 
recommendations for each patient case are made by a panel of pain specialists 
representing internal medicine, addiction medicine, rehabilitation medicine, 
anesthesiology, psychiatry, and nursing. The outcomes assessed in this 
randomized trial focus on pain intensity, pain's interference on function and 
sleep, and anxiety, depression, and cost-effectiveness. Some of the challenges 
and lessons that we have learned early in implementing the TelePain intervention 
are also reported.

A review of the psychometric properties of generic utility measures in multiple 
sclerosis.

University, 3654 Prom Sir William Osler, Montreal, QC, H3G 1Y5, Canada,

OBJECTIVE: The reliability and validity of generic utility measures have not yet 
been summarized in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is important to 
assess the psychometric properties of these measures, to ensure that the values 
obtained by the scoring system are valid for interpretation and utilization by 
clinicians, researchers and policy makers. Therefore, the objective of this 
review was to summarize the evidence from published literature on the 
psychometric properties of generic utility measures in MS.
METHODS: A structured literature search was conducted by using multiple 
electronic databases. All potentially relevant abstracts and full-text articles 
were read to identify publications that may be eligible for inclusion in the 
review. A meta-analysis was conducted to combine correlation coefficient values 
for convergent validity. The Schmidt-Hunter method, a weighted mean of the 
correlation coefficient values, was used. Heterogeneity, the percentage of total 
variation across studies that is due to between-study differences rather than 
chance, was assessed using the I (2) statistic.
RESULTS: The following generic utility measures were identified: the EQ-5D (n = 
9)/EQ-5D-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) (n = 1), followed by the Health Utilities Index Mark 
3/2 (HUI2/HUI3) (n = 3), the SF-6D (n = 2), the Assessment of Quality of Life 
(AQOL) (n = 2), and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale (n = 1). Ceiling and 
floor effects were present for the EQ-5D and the SF-6D, but not for the HUI3. 
The EQ-5D, the SF-6D and the HUI3 demonstrated excellent reliability. In terms 
of discriminative ability, the SF-6D and the QWB scale were not able to 
differentiate between moderately and severely disabled MS patients, and the 
EQ-5D was not able to differentiate between those who were mildly and moderately 
disabled. The AQOL and the HUI3, on the other hand, demonstrated good 
discriminative ability, as both measures were able to differentiate between all 
levels of disability. As for convergent validity, the HUI2/HUI3 were highly 
correlated (r = 0.7) against measurement instruments that evaluated impairments 
such as disease severity, ambulation and manual dexterity. The EQ-5D, SF-6D and 
the QWB scale demonstrated small to moderate correlations (r = 0.4) against 
instruments evaluating impairments, and slightly stronger correlations against 
measures of activity limitations/participation restrictions and health-related 
quality of life (HRQL) (r = 0.6).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first study to review the validity and 
reliability of generic utility measures in MS. The HUI3 demonstrated the 
strongest psychometric properties when compared with other utility measures. 
However, the HUI3 only measures impairment and excludes important components of 
HRQL such as participation restrictions. The EQ-5D, the SF-6D and the QWB scale, 
on the other hand, do include items on participation. However, these measures 
demonstrated a lack of content validity in MS by missing certain domains that 
were important to the disease, as well as difficulty in differentiating between 
different levels of disability. The addition of MS-specific 'bolt-ons' to 
generic utility measures and the development of an MS specific utility measure 
are possible areas of exploration for future research.

The better than dead method: feasibility and interpretation of a valuation 
study.

PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Ralph.vanHoorn@radboudumc.nl.

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the valuation of health states worse than being dead 
suffers from two problems: [1] the use of different elicitation methods for 
positive and negative values, necessitating arbitrary transformations to map 
negative to positive values; and [2] the inability to quantify that values are 
time dependent. The Better than Dead (BTD) method is a health-state valuation 
method where states with a certain duration are compared with being dead. It has 
the potential to overcome these problems.
OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility of the BTD method to estimate values for the 
EQ-5D system.
METHODS: A representative sample of 291 Dutch respondents (aged 18-45 years) was 
recruited. In a web-based questionnaire, preferences were elicited for a 
selection of 50 different health states with six durations between 1 and 40 
years. Random-effects models were used to estimate the effects of 
socio-demographic and experimental variables, and to estimate values for the 
EQ-5D. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 41 respondents.
RESULTS: Important determinants for BTD were a religious life stance [odds ratio 
4.09 (2.00-8.36)] and the educational level. The fastest respondents more often 
preferred health-state scenarios to being dead and had lower test-retest 
reliability (0.45 versus 0.77 and 0.84 for fast, medium and slow response times, 
respectively). The results showed a small number of so-called maximal endurable 
time states.
CONCLUSION: Valuating health states using the BTD method is feasible and 
reliable. Further research should explore how the experimental setting modifies 
how values depend on time.

Active and successful aging: a European policy perspective.

Over the past two decades, "active aging" has emerged in Europe as the foremost 
policy response to the challenges of population aging. This article examines the 
concept of active aging and how it differs from that of "successful aging." In 
particular, it shows how active aging presents a more holistic, life 
course-oriented approach than successful aging. We provide a critical 
perspective on active aging too by, first, tracing its emergence in Europe and 
then showing how, in practice, it has been dominated by a narrow economic or 
productivist perspective that prioritizes the extension of working life. It has 
also been gender blind. Nonetheless, it is argued that an active aging approach 
has the potential to enable countries to respond successfully to the challenges 
of population aging because of its comprehensive focus and emphasis on societal 
as well as individual responsibility. Finally, we set out the basic principles 
that need to be followed if the full potential of active aging is to be 
achieved.

Predictors of colorectal neoplasia after polypectomy: based on initial and 
consecutive findings.

Koornstra JJ.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal adenoma patients are kept under surveillance because of 
the risk of developing metachronous neoplasia. The aim is to determine 
predictors of neoplasia development after polypectomy.
METHODS: It is an observational cohort study. 433 Patients who had ≥1 adenoma 
removed between 1988 and 2004 were included, with follow-up until 2010. 
Multivariate analysis of patient and adenoma characteristics was performed at 
initial colonoscopy and at consecutive positive examinations. The main outcome 
measured was the development of metachronous (advanced) adenomas during 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 85 months. Multivariate analysis identified male 
sex, ≥3 adenomas, high-grade dysplasia and age ≥55 years as risk factors for 
metachronous lesions at first surveillance. Analysis using life expectancy as a 
timescale showed ≥3 adenomas to be the only predictive factor. The time to 
second or third metachronous adenoma did not depend on the number of adenomas. 
Patients with ≥3 adenomas were five years older at the time of their first 
polypectomy compared with those with fewer adenomas, but of the same age at the 
first recurrence. Prevalence of high-grade dysplasia was associated with age and 
high-grade dysplasia in the prior adenoma independent of time interval.
CONCLUSIONS: Adenoma development after polypectomy occurs in a regular and 
repetitive way. Our data suggest that only the interval between the initial 
colonoscopy and the first follow-up colonoscopy should be based on initial 
findings, i.e. number of adenomas, and that subsequent colonoscopies can be 
planned at predetermined intervals.

Demographic, epidemiological, and health transitions: are they relevant to 
population health patterns in Africa?

Kuate Defo B(1).

Author information:
(1)Public Health Research Institute and Department of Demography, University of 
Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; barthelemy.kuate.defo@umontreal.ca.

BACKGROUND: Studies of trends in population changes and epidemiological profiles 
in the developing world have overwhelmingly relied upon the concepts of 
demographic, epidemiological, and health transitions, even though their 
usefulness in describing and understanding population and health trends in 
developing countries has been repeatedly called into question. The issue is 
particularly relevant for the study of population health patterns in Africa and 
sub-Saharan Africa, as the history and experience there differs substantially 
from that of Western Europe and North America, for which these concepts were 
originally developed.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is two-fold: to review and clarify any 
distinction between the concepts of demographic transition, epidemiological 
transition and health transition and to identify summary indicators of 
population health to test how well these concepts apply in Africa.
RESULTS: Notwithstanding the characteristically diverse African context, Africa 
is a continent of uncertainties and emergencies where discontinuities and 
interruptions of health, disease, and mortality trends reflect the enduring 
fragility and instability of countries and the vulnerabilities of individuals 
and populations in the continent. Africa as a whole remains the furthest behind 
the world's regions in terms of health improvements and longevity, as do its 
sub-Saharan African regions and societies specifically. This study documents: 1) 
theoretically and empirically the similarities and differences between the 
demographic transition, epidemiological transition, and health transition; 2) 
simple summary indicators that can be used to evaluate their descriptive and 
predictive features; 3) marked disparities in the onset and pace of variations 
and divergent trends in health, disease, and mortality patterns as well as 
fertility and life expectancy trajectories among African countries and regions 
over the past 60 years; 4) the rapid decline in infant mortality and gains in 
life expectancy from the 1950s through the 1990s in a context of preponderant 
communicable diseases in all African countries; 5) the salient role of adult 
mortality, mostly ascribed to HIV/AIDS and co-morbidities, since the 1990s in 
reversing trends in mortality decline, its interruption of life expectancy 
improvements, and its reversal of gender differences in life expectancies 
disadvantaging women in several countries with the highest prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS; 6) the huge impact of wars in reversing the trends in under-five 
mortality decline in sub-Saharan countries in the 1990s and beyond. These 
assessments of these transition frameworks and these phenomena were not well 
documented to date for all five regions and 57 countries of Africa.
CONCLUSION: Prevailing frameworks of demographic, epidemiological, and health 
transitions as descriptive and predictive models are incomplete or irrelevant 
for charting the population and health experiences and prospects of national 
populations in the African context.

Changes in mortality and human longevity in Kerala: are they leading to the 
advanced stage?

(ISEC), Bangalore, India; benson@isec.ac.in.

(ISEC), Bangalore, India.

BACKGROUND: During the last century, Kerala witnessed drastic mortality 
reduction and high improvement in longevity. This achievement is often compared 
with that of developed countries. However, how far the early advantages in 
mortality reduction have further enhanced in Kerala remains unknown. In most 
developed countries, advanced stage of mortality reduction and further increase 
in longevity was achieved mainly due to the mortality shift from adult and older 
ages to oldest ages (Olshansky and Ault 1986).
OBJECTIVES: Considering the lack of comprehensive study on the change in 
longevity in Kerala, this study focuses on discovering (i) the historical 
time-periods that provided the biggest gain to life expectancy and also the 
beneficiaries (by age group and sex) and (ii) the contributions of major groups 
of causes of death in mortality reduction and consequent improvement in 
longevity.
METHODOLOGY AND DATA: The study uses the methodology proposed by Olshansky and 
Ault in 1986. It used methods such as Temporary Life Expectancy (TLE), Annual 
Relative Change in TLE, Decomposition of changes in longevity among different 
age groups (gender and spatial) and causes of deaths, for the analysis. It used 
data from various sources such as Census, Civil Registration System (CRS) and 
Directorate of Health Services (DHS), as well as survey data from Sample 
Registration System (SRS) and Medically Certified Causes of Deaths (MCCD) for 
this study.
FINDING AND CONCLUSION: The study found that overall mortality dramatically 
declined in the state in the recent decades. Younger ages have contributed the 
most for this reduction. Therefore, further mortality reduction is possible in 
adult and early old ages. However, the contribution of these ages to life 
expectancy was lower than that of youngsters until 1991-2000 especially among 
males. This may indicate a slow progress towards the advanced stage of 
epidemiological transition characterized by high prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases. The paper concludes that although the health issues of infants, 
children, and mothers in the reproductive age group, are effectively addressed 
through various policies in Kerala, the state needs to focus more on the health 
problems of adults, especially males.

The epidemiological transition in Antananarivo, Madagascar: an assessment based 
on death registers (1900-2012).

Statistique de Madagascar (INSTAT), Antananarivo, Madagascar.

BACKGROUND: Madagascar today has one of the highest life expectancies in 
sub-Saharan Africa, despite being among the poorest countries in the continent. 
There are relatively few detailed accounts of the epidemiological transition in 
this country due to the lack of a comprehensive death registration system at the 
national level. However, in Madagascar's capital city, death registration was 
established around the start of the 20th century and is now considered virtually 
complete.
OBJECTIVE: We provide an overview of trends in all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality in Antananarivo to document the timing and pace of the mortality 
decline and the changes in the cause-of-death structure.
DESIGN: Death registers covering the period 1976-2012 were digitized and the 
population at risk of dying was estimated from available censuses and surveys. 
Trends for the period 1900-1976 were partly reconstructed from published 
sources.
RESULTS: The crude death rate stagnated around 30‰ until the 1940s in 
Antananarivo. Mortality declined rapidly after the World War II and then 
resurged again in the 1980s as a result of the re-emergence of malaria and the 
collapse of Madagascar's economy. Over the past 30 years, impressive gains in 
life expectancy have been registered thanks to the unabated decline in child 
mortality, despite political instability, a lasting economic crisis and the 
persistence of high rates of chronic malnutrition. Progress in adult survival 
has been more modest because reductions in infectious diseases and diseases of 
the respiratory system have been partly offset by increases in cardiovascular 
diseases, neoplasms, and other diseases, particularly at age 50 years and over.
CONCLUSIONS: The transition in Antananarivo has been protracted and largely 
dependent on anti-microbial and anti-parasitic medicine. The capital city now 
faces a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The ongoing 
registration of deaths in the capital generates a unique database to evaluate 
the performance of the health system and measure intervention impacts.
