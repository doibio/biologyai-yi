BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of HIV positive people live in Africa where food 
insecurity and under nutrition are endemic. However the impact of malnutrition 
on treatment outcome is not clear. This study assessed the effect of under 
nutrition on Anti-Retroviral Therapy treatment outcome among pediatric age group 
living with HIV/AIDS in Public Hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on records of 242 pediatric 
children in Guraghe zone Public Hospitals. Also median, mean, standard deviation 
and interquartile range were calculated. Life table, hazard function and 
survival function were plotted. Log rank test with 95% confidence interval of 
mean survival time was done. The nutritional status data were managed via WHO 
Anthros plus and BMI for age Z score was calculated. To assess effects of 
nutritional status on mortality, both Bivariate and multivariate cox 
proportional hazard regression was conducted with crude (CHR) and adjusted 
hazard ratio (AHR) (95% confidence interval and p value). P value of less than 
0.05 was used as cut off point to declare statistical significance.
RESULTS: A total of 243 records of pediatric ART records with mean age of 11.6 
(± 3.8 years) were reviewed. About 178 (73.3%) have got therapeutic feeding on 
the course of ART treatment. Whereas significant number of children, 163 (67.1%) 
reported to had eating problems. A total of 13 (5.3%) children were dead with 
incidence density of 11.2 deaths per 1000 person years. There is significantly 
higher survival time among well nourished (11.1 years with 95% CI: 10.8 to 11.4) 
as compared to underweight children (9.76 with 95% CI: 9.19 to 10.32 years). 
Underweight children had almost three fold increase incidence of death 
(AHR = 3.01; 95% CI: 0.80-11.4). Similarly children with anemia had higher 
incidence of death than children without anemia (AHR = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.49-4.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Low nutritional status at the start of ART evidenced by underweight 
and anemia were found to be predictors of survival among HIV positive children. 
There should be improved, sustained and focused nutritional screening, care and 
treatment for children on ART follow up.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with 
2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) and dietary 
phenylalanine and tyrosine restriction improves physical health and life 
expectancy in Tyrosinemia type 1 (TT1). However, neurocognitive outcome is 
suboptimal. This study aimed to investigate behavior problems and health-related 
quality of life (HR-QoL) in NTBC-dietary-treated TT1 and to relate this to 
phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations.
RESULTS: Thirty-one TT1 patients (19 males; mean age 13.9 ± 5.3 years) were 
included in this study. Emotional and behavioral problems, as measured by the 
Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, were present in almost all 
domains. Attention and thought problems were particularly evident. HR-QoL was 
assessed by the TNO AZL Children's and Adults QoL questionnaires. Poorer HR-QoL 
as compared to reference populations was observed for the domains: independent 
daily functioning, cognitive functioning and school performance, social 
contacts, motor functioning, and vitality. Both internalizing and externalizing 
behavior problems were associated with low phenylalanine (and associated lower 
tyrosine) concentrations during the first year of life. In contrast, high 
tyrosine (and associated higher phenylalanine) concentrations during life and 
specifically the last year before testing were associated with more 
internalizing behavior and/or HR-QoL problems.
CONCLUSIONS: TT1 patients showed several behavior problems and a lower HR-QoL. 
Associations with metabolic control differed for different age periods. This 
suggests the need for continuous fine-tuning and monitoring of dietary treatment 
to keep phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations within target ranges in 
NTBC-treated TT1 patients.

BACKGROUND: Determining the effectiveness of community-based health promotion 
and disease prevention programs requires an appropriate data collection tool. 
This study aimed to develop a comprehensive health questionnaire for older 
adults, called the HABiT, and evaluate its reliability, content validity, and 
face validity in assessing individual health-related items (e.g., health status, 
healthcare utilization) and five specific scales: knowledge, current health 
behaviors (risk factors), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), perceived risk 
and understanding, and self-efficacy.
METHODS: Iterative survey development and evaluation of its psychometric 
properties in a convenience sample of 28 older adults (≥ 55 years old), half 
from a low-income population. Following item generation, the questionnaire was 
assessed for content validity (expert panel), face validity (participant 
feedback), internal consistency of each scale (Cronbach's alpha), and 
test-retest reliability for each item and scale (Pearson's r and phi 
correlations, as appropriate).
RESULTS: Questions were drawn from 15 sources, but primarily three surveys: 
Canadian Community Health Survey, Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire 
(CANRISK), and a survey by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. Expert 
consensus was attained for item inclusion and representation of the desired 
constructs. Participants completing the questionnaire deemed the questions to be 
clear and appropriate. Test-retest reliability for many individual items was 
moderate-to-high, with some exceptions for items that can reasonably change in a 
short period (e.g., perceived day-to-day stress). Of the five potential scales 
evaluated, two had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.60) and 
a subset of one scale also had acceptable internal consistency. Test-retest 
reliability was high (correlation ≥ 0.80) for all scales and sub-scales.
CONCLUSIONS: The HABiT is a reliable and suitable comprehensive tool with 
content and face validity that can be used to evaluate health promotion and 
chronic disease prevention programs in older adults, including low-income older 
adults. Some noted limitations are discussed. Data collected using this tool 
also provides a diabetes risk score, health literacy score, and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) for economic analysis.

The current literature regarding surgical treatment for tumors in the 
sphenopetroclival (SPC) region is merely scarce. Through a comprehensive 
literature review, we investigated the indications, outcomes, and complications 
of different surgical approaches to the SPC meningiomas. Given its complicated 
relationship between these slow-progression tumors and some critical 
neurovascular structures in the SPC region, surgical treatment of these tumors 
faces the challenge of achieving a maximal grade of resection, while preserving 
patient functionality. The development of new surgical techniques and approaches 
in recent years have permitted the advancement in the treatment of these tumors, 
with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality. The choice of a surgical 
approach as a treatment for the lesion depends mainly on the type of tumor 
extension, surgeon's preferences, and the displacement of neurovascular 
structures. Rather than focusing on one single strategy of treatment, the 
skull-base surgeon should tailor the approach based on the origin and features 
of the lesion; as well as the peculiarities of the surgical anatomy. This 
strategy aims to decrease morbidity and to optimize tumor resection and patient 
quality of life.

The substantial social and economic burden attributable to smoking is 
well-known, with heavy smokers at higher risk of chronic disease and premature 
mortality than light smokers and nonsmokers. In aging societies with high rates 
of male smoking such as in East Asia, smoking is a leading preventable risk 
factor for extending lives (including work-lives) and healthy aging. However, 
little is known about whether smoking interventions targeted at heavy smokers 
relative to light smokers lead to disproportionately larger improvements in life 
expectancy and prevalence of chronic diseases and how the effects vary across 
populations. Using a microsimulation model, we examined the health effects of 
smoking reduction by simulating an elimination of smoking among subgroups of 
smokers in South Korea, Singapore, and the United States. We found that life 
expectancy would increase by 0.2 to 1.5 years among light smokers and 2.5 to 3.7 
years among heavy smokers. Whereas both interventions led to an increased life 
expectancy and decreased the prevalence of chronic diseases in all three 
countries, the life-extension benefits were greatest for those who would 
otherwise have been heavy smokers. Our findings illustrate how smoking 
interventions may have significant economic and social benefits, especially for 
life extension, that vary across countries.

Endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer is currently in a state of flux 
with much uncertainty about choice of agents and duration of therapy. The 
standard treatment span of 5 years usually incorporates an aromatase inhibitor 
in the majority of postmenopausal patients. Hormonal therapy has a cytostatic 
action that provides a biological rationale for continuing treatment for more 
prolonged periods to reduce risk of late recurrence in estrogen 
receptor-positive disease. Several trials of extended endocrine therapy for 
periods varying from 7.5 to 10 years have shown mixed results for gains in 
disease-free survival. The challenge is to assimilate available data and apply 
clinical judgment to tailor therapies taking account of intrinsic risk of 
disease recurrence, patient preference, tolerability to date, and 
co-morbidities.

Using the Job Demands-Resources model literature and the life-span theory as 
scholarly frameworks, we examined the effects of job demands and job resources 
as mediators in the relationship between bundles of used HRM practices and 
employee outcomes. In addition, we tested for age differences in our research 
model. Findings confirmed the hypothesized original 2-factor structure 
representing maintenance and development HRM practices. Structural Equation 
Modeling analyses showed that the maintenance HRM bundle related directly and 
negatively to employee outcomes, without moderating effects of age. However, job 
resources appeared to mediate this relationship in a positive way as it also did 
for the development HRM bundle. Whereas this study showed the 'driving power' of 
the actual use of HRM bundles through job resources, regardless of the 
employee's age, this study also suggests a 'dark side' of HRM. In particular, we 
found that development HRM bundles may also increase job demands, which, in 
turn, may result in lower levels of beneficial employee outcomes. These 
empirical outcomes demonstrate the strength of the driving power eliciting from 
job resources preceded by any HRM bundle. Moreover, this effect appears to apply 
to employees of all ages. Our moderated-mediation model appeared robust for 
several control variables. Overall, this study provides an extension of the 
well-known Job Demands-Resources model by including maintenance and development 
bundles of HRM practices used by employees that have a differential effect on 
job demands and job resources which in turn have an impact on employee outcomes.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a popular method for examining real-life 
decision-making. Research has shown gender related differences in performance, 
in that men consistently outperform women. It has been suggested that these 
performance differences are related to decreased emotional control in women 
compared to men. Given the likely role of emotion in these gender differences, 
in the present study, we examine the effect of a humor induction on IGT 
performance and whether the effect of humor is moderated by gender. IGT 
performance and parameters from the Expectancy Valence Model (EVM) were measured 
in 68 university students (34 men; mean age 22.02, SD = 4.3 and 34 women; mean 
age 22.3, SD = 4.1) during a 100 trial-IGT task. Participants were exposed to a 
brief video before each of the IGT decisions available; one half of the samples 
(17 men and 17 women) was exposed to 100 humor videos, while the other half was 
exposed to 100 non-humor videos during the task. We observed a significant 
interaction between gender and humor, such that under humor, women's performance 
during the last block (trials 80-100) improved (compared to women under 
non-humor), whereas men's performance during the last block was worse (compared 
to men under non-humor). Consistent with previous work, under non-humor, men 
outperformed women in the last block. Lastly, our EVM results show that humor 
impacts the learning mechanisms of decision-making differently in men and women. 
Humor impaired men's ability to acquire knowledge about the payoff structure of 
the decks, and as a consequence, they were stuck in suboptimal performance. On 
the other hand, humor facilitated women's ability to explore and to learn from 
experience, improving performance. These findings deepen our understanding of 
the mechanisms underlying IGT decision-making and differential effects of humor 
in men and women.

Department, "Malaxa" Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common congenital heart malformation that 
produces cyanosis. It consists of four different defects of the heart: 
ventricular septal defect, pulmonary artery stenosis (blockage of blood flow 
from the right ventricle to the lungs), right ventricle hypertrophy and 
dextroposition of aorta. Echocardiography is essential in establishing the 
diagnosis of patients with cardiac malformation. Patients with Fallot tetralogy 
present a higher frequency of major non-cardiac congenital disorders. The 
association with congenital scoliosis influences vital and functional overcomes, 
restricting physical activity and lowering life expectancy. The author presents 
therapeutic management on the clinical case of a 13-year-old child with Fallot 
tetralogy and congenital scoliosis. Therapeutic management of both illnesses 
consisted in serial surgical interventions as it follows: first time at the age 
of six years, cardiac malformation was solved, and later, at the age of 13 years 
the correction of spinal deformity was performed.

Is Stem Cell Therapy an Answer to Heart Failure: A Literature Search.

The heart is one of the most industrious organs in the human body. It starts 
beating in the first few weeks of embryonic life and keeps pumping blood till 
death. This organ can host a range of diseases as well. Some can hamper the 
vasculature, while others can affect its electrical activity, the heart valves, 
etc. All these conditions can lead to end-stage failure where it can no longer 
meet the requirements of the body's milieu. This imbalance between supply and 
demand leads to an array of symptoms. Medical management can reduce these 
clinical effects and possibly prolong the life expectancy in such patients. 
However, prescription medications can also have their own adverse effects. This 
necessitates that each line of treatment should be assessed on a risk vs benefit 
basis. The conventional approach has been to try and slow down the progression 
of heart failure (HF). However, the inception of stem cells in the management of 
HF has the potential for reversal of this pathology. Keeping this in view, many 
studies and trials are under process. To turn the clock back on the HF, before 
complications set in or get out of control, is the main focus of the time. This 
article attempts to evaluate various studies about stem cell therapy (SCT) and 
highlight the important aspects of this novel modality in changing patients' 
lives.

Introduction Depression is a common psychiatric complication associated with 
stroke. However, while most studies focus on post-stroke depression (PSD) 
subsequent to ischemic strokes, fewer studies have specifically 
explored depressive symptoms and the use of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The 
aim of our study was to identify the incidence and factors associated with 
depression in ICH patients and the use of SSRIs as therapy by physicians at a 
tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Materials and methods A 
retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients with ICH through 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding 
system electronic medical records of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, 
Pakistan. Patient records spanning a period of five years at the hospital were 
identified and analyzed by neurology residents. Patients' clinical, laboratory, 
radiological, and pharmacological data were recorded and analyzed using a 
structured proforma. Patients with a past history of depression or those who 
were taking SSRIs at the time of admission were excluded from the analysis. 
Depression was defined as the presence of five or more symptoms according to the 
diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Results Out of the 458 patients we analyzed, 
258 (56%) were men and 200 (44%) were women. The mean age was 59 years. Median 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 13 
(range: 0-42), and the median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 4 (range: 
0-6). On neuroimaging, sites of hemorrhage in patients were found to include the 
basal ganglia/thalamus in 279 (61%) patients, cerebral cortex in 105 (23%), 
cerebellum in 25 (5%), brain stem in 17 (4%), ventricles in 17 (4%), and 
multiple sites in eight (2%). We found that 48 (10%) patients had a ventricular 
extension, and 130 (28%) had midline shift, hydrocephalus, or both. Overall, 103 
(22%) patients met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression. The most 
common depressive symptoms included tearfulness (67%), sadness (55%), and loss 
of interest or pleasure in life activities (53%). None of the patients reported 
suicidal ideation. Only seven patients (2%) were seen by a psychiatrist. The 
presence of depression was not significantly associated with hemorrhage sites 
[prabability value (p): 0.55] or the extent of disability (p: 0.09). Among the 
103 depressed patients, only 25 (24%) received SSRIs during the hospital stay. A 
total of 57 (12%) received SSRIs during the hospital stay, of which only 25 had 
met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression. The mean duration between the 
diagnosis of ICH and the start of SSRIs was five days (range 3-25 days). None of 
the patients received any psychotherapeutic help for depression. At the time of 
discharge, only 13 (13%) of the 103 patients diagnosed with depression were 
discharged on SSRIs, while 23 that had not met the DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria were discharged on SSRIs. Conclusion The present study demonstrates 
that depression is not uncommon in acute ICH patients, and it is both 
underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Physicians should be trained to 
accurately identify and effectively treat depressive symptoms in ICH patients. 
Clear guidelines should be developed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of 
post-ICH depression in hospital settings.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated how changes in 84 proteins over a 10-year 
period of aging were related to changes in measures of body fat and distribution 
over the same period.
METHODS: Cardiovascular candidate proteins were measured using the proximal 
extension assay technique, along with BMI and waist-hip ratio (WHR), at ages 70, 
75, and 80 in 1,016 participants of the Prospective Investigation of the 
Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) cohort. Associations of changes in plasma 
protein levels, BMI, and WHR over time were analyzed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Changes in 19 and 16 proteins were significantly associated with 
changes in BMI and WHR, respectively (P < 0.00059), over the investigated 
10-year period. Leptin and fatty acid-binding protein 4 were among the proteins 
most strongly associated with changes in both BMI and WHR. Four of the proteins 
significantly tracked with change in BMI (P < 0.00059) but not WHR (P > 0.05): 
endothelial cell-specific molecule 1, pentraxin-related protein PTX3, 
ST2 protein (also known as interleukin-1 receptor-like 1), and spondin-1. Five 
proteins tracked with change in WHR (P < 0.00059) but not BMI (P > 0.05): 
caspase-8, cathepsin L1, oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, 
interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha, and C-C motif chemokine 20.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large longitudinal study of how changes in plasma 
protein signatures are associated with changes in measures of body fat and 
distribution over 10 years of aging.

BACKGROUND: The improvement of breast cancer treatment and the extension of 
survivorship have led to the development of postoperative complications among 
cancer survivors. Health literacy (HL), defined as patients' capability of using 
health information to maintain their health status, can enable breast cancer 
patients to manage postoperative complications.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to develop a tailored rehabilitation 
education (TRE) program and examine the effectiveness of this program in 
improving the HL and health status with breast cancer.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial recruited 99 breast cancer patients 
(49 and 50 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) within 1 week 
after surgery. Four-week individualized TRE programs were implemented to improve 
their HL and health status.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the TRE program produced significant 
improvements in HL and health status in the components of the International 
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. However, no significant 
difference was observed in the activity scores obtained using the Barthel Index 
between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Our finding supports the effectiveness of 1-month TRE in improving 
HL and all components of the International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health status, except the activity component among breast cancer 
in Taiwan.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Clinicians could incorporate the TRE techniques in 
the rehabilitation sessions according to the healthcare, disease prevention, and 
health promotion domains to improve the clinical outcomes as well as change 
their health behaviors and attitudes of patients with breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma with an extensive intravenous 
tumor thrombus which is extending into internal jugular vein (IJV), superior 
vena cava (SVC) and right atrium (RA) is a rare clinical finding. We report a 
multimodal staged surgical approach for this life threatening complicated case.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 52 year old female, presented with diffuse thyroid 
swelling, FNAC revealed it as follicular thyroid neoplasm. Computed tomography 
(CT) scan showed tumor thrombus extending into IJV, SVC and right atrium (RA). 
We planned complete resection of tumor in two stage operation. Initially in 
first stage, cardio-thoracic surgery was done to remove SVC and RA thrombus to 
eliminate the immediate risk of pulmonary embolism. In the second stage, neck 
surgery was performed to resect thyroid tumor and to perform extensive 
thrombectomy in the cervical veins. This patient has been followed for one year 
after successful surgery without recurrence.
DISCUSSION: Venous involvement by follicular thyroid carcinoma reaching to RA is 
a rare life threatening condition. Though there is no standard guidelines 
available, treatment strategies should be discussed and planned among 
multidisciplinary team. Intraluminal extension is not a contraindication for 
aggressive surgical management. It will avoid fatal pulmonary embolism, as well 
as improve overall survival of the patient.
CONCLUSION: Invasion of the great vessels by thyroid carcinoma is usually 
associated with early relapse and poor prognosis, but if tumor in the blood 
vessel is resected completely, a better prognosis is possible. Two staged 
surgical approach is safe and gives a predictable outcome.

OBJECTIVE: Treatment options for HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) 
patients have expanded markedly since trastuzumab approval in 1998. Several 
other regimens are now available, including pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus 
docetaxel, T-DM1, capecitabine plus lapatinib, and trastuzumab plus lapatinib. 
This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of four treatment sequences for 
HER-2-positive mBC according to the Taiwanese National Health Insurance 
Administration (TNHIA).
METHODS: Costs (U.S. Dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years) of 
four treatment sequences for HER-2-positive mBC patients were examined using a 
Markov model over a lifetime horizon. Transition probabilities, disease 
progression, and probability of adverse events and survival were derived from 
clinical trial data. Costs and health utilities were estimated from TNHIA, 
Taipei Medical University Hospital, and the literature. Deterministic, 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses and a scenario analysis examined parameter 
uncertainty and accounted for drug wastage in dosage and cost calculations.
RESULTS: Sequence 3 (1st line: trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: T-DM1; 3rd 
line: trastuzumab plus lapatinib) was the most cost-effective sequence followed 
by sequence 1 (1st line: pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: 
T-DM1; 3rd line: capecitabine plus lapatinib), and sequence 4 (1st line: 
trastuzumab plus docetaxel; 2nd line: trastuzumab plus lapatinib; 3rd line: 
trastuzumab plus capecitabine), respectively. The model was sensitive to costs 
and transition probabilities, but not particularly sensitive to the wastage 
assumption.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the TNHIA, trastuzumab plus docetaxel as 
1st line followed by T-DM1 and trastuzumab plus lapatinib as 2nd and 3rd line 
represents the most cost-effective strategy among the four sequences considered 
for treating HER-2-positive mBC patients.

Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading risk factor for end-stage 
renal disease and is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease in patients with diabetes. It is possible that novel markers portraying 
the pathophysiological underpinning processes may be useful.Aim: To investigate 
the associations between 80 circulating proteins, measured by a proximity 
extension assay, and prevalent DKD and major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) in type 2 diabetes.Methods: We randomly divided individuals with type 2 
diabetes from three cohorts into a two-thirds discovery and one-third 
replication set (total n = 813, of whom 231 had DKD defined by estimated 
glomerular filtration rate <60 mg/mL/1.73 m2 and/or urinary albumin-creatinine 
ratio ≥3 g/mol). Proteins associated with DKD were also assessed as predictors 
for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in persons with DKD at 
baseline.Results: Four proteins were positively associated with DKD in models 
adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, and 
diabetes medication: kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, odds ratio [OR] per 
standard deviation increment, 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14); 
growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16-1.69); myoglobin 
(OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10, OR 1.43, 
95% CI 1.17-1.74). In patients with DKD, GDF-15 was significantly associated 
with increased risk of MACE after adjustments for baseline age, sex, 
microalbuminuria, and kidney function and (59 MACE events during 7 years 
follow-up, hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.43 [95% CI 1.03-1.98]) 
but not after further adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors.Conclusion: 
Our proteomics approach confirms and extends previous associations of higher 
circulating levels of GDF-15 with both micro- and macrovascular disease in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data encourage additional studies evaluating 
the clinical utility of our findings.

The vulnerability of executive functioning: The additive effects of recent 
non-restorative sleep, pain interference, and use of expressive suppression on 
test performance.

Objective: Certain transient contextual factors (i.e. higher expressive 
suppression, pain, and non-restorative sleep) are all associated with temporary 
decrements in performance on measures of executive functioning (EF), making 
clinical interpretation of EF scores challenging. Additionally, pain, 
non-restorative sleep, and expressive suppression are thought to be mutually 
interrelated with one another and with depression. This study sought to 
investigate how these factors impact EF when considered simultaneously.Methods: 
A total of 95 community-dwelling older adults completed the Push-Turn-Taptap 
(PTT) task as a measure of EF, and self-report measures of expressive 
suppression, pain interference, non-restorative sleep, and depressive 
symptoms.Results: Expressive suppression and pain interference, but not 
non-restorative sleep, demonstrated unique relationships with EF performance 
when all factors were considered simultaneously. Expressive suppression fully 
mediated the relationship between non-restorative sleep and EF performance, but 
not when controlling for depression. When a single contextual burden composite 
was generated collapsing across transient contextual factors, a composite that 
included all three examined factors (i.e. including non-restorative sleep) 
accounted for more variance in EF scores beyond depression than a composite that 
only included expressive suppression and pain interference.Conclusion: 
Expressive suppression, pain interference, and non-restorative sleep share some 
overlap with one another and with depression, but nonetheless have an additive 
negative effect on EF performance beyond depression. Quantifying these transient 
contextual factors may improve the accuracy of EF assessment and, by extension, 
the utility of EF measures in predicting daily functioning. These transient 
contextual factors also represent targets that, if better managed, may reduce EF 
lapses in daily life.

BACKGROUND: Clear evidence on the benefit-harm balance and cost effectiveness of 
population-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is missing. We aim to 
systematically evaluate the long-term effectiveness, harms and cost 
effectiveness of different organized CRC screening strategies in Austria.
METHODS: A decision-analytic cohort simulation model for colorectal adenoma and 
cancer with a lifelong time horizon was developed, calibrated to the Austrian 
epidemiological setting and validated against observed data. We compared four 
strategies: 1) No Screening, 2) FIT: annual immunochemical fecal occult blood 
test age 40-75 years, 3) gFOBT: annual guaiac-based fecal occult blood test age 
40-75 years, and 4) COL: 10-yearly colonoscopy age 50-70 years. Predicted 
outcomes included: benefits expressed as life-years gained [LYG], CRC-related 
deaths avoided and CRC cases avoided; harms as additional complications due to 
colonoscopy (physical harm) and positive test results (psychological harm); and 
lifetime costs. Tradeoffs were expressed as incremental harm-benefit ratios 
(IHBR, incremental positive test results per LYG) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios [ICER]. The perspective of the Austrian public health 
care system was adopted. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: The most effective strategies were FIT and COL. gFOBT was less 
effective and more costly than FIT. Moving from COL to FIT results in an 
incremental unintended psychological harm of 16 additional positive test results 
to gain one life-year. COL was cost saving compared to No Screening. Moving from 
COL to FIT has an ICER of 15,000 EUR per LYG.
CONCLUSIONS: Organized CRC-screening with annual FIT or 10-yearly colonoscopy is 
most effective. The choice between these two options depends on the individual 
preferences and benefit-harm tradeoffs of screening candidates.
