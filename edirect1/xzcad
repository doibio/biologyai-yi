Type IV pili are long filamentous structures on the surface of bacteria, which 
can be rapidly assembled or disassembled with pilin subunits by molecular 
motors. They can generate force during retraction and are involved in many 
bacterial functions. Steered molecular dynamics simulations with coarse-grained 
MARTINI models are carried out to investigate the mechanical behaviors of pili 
under tension. Our study is the first to report a Young's modulus of 
0.80±0.07GPa and a spring constant of 1294.6±116.5kJmol-1nm-2 for pilus. Our 
results show the mechanical responses of pili are different from those described 
by the worm-like chain model and the van der Waal's interactions play a critical 
role in the mechanical responses. Moreover, the effects of pulling rates and 
virtual spring constants of pilus on Young's modulus are studied and two 
distinct morphological stages with the conformational changes appear during the 
extension of pilus are observed. This work provide insight into the mechanics 
and the deformation mechanism of pilus assembly.

Advances in public health in the past century have seen a sharp increase in 
human life expectancy. With these changes have come an increased prevalence of 
age-related pathologies and health burdens in the elderly. Patient age is the 
biggest risk factor for multiple chronic conditions that often occur 
simultaneously within a single individual. An alternative to disease-centric 
therapeutic approaches is that of 'geroscience', which aims to define molecular 
mechanisms that link age to overall disease risk. One such mechanism is 
deregulation of CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs). Initially 
identified for their role in modulating CREB transcription, the past 5 years has 
seen an expansion in knowledge of new cellular regulators and roles of CRTCs 
beyond CREB. CRTCs have been shown to modulate organismal aging in 
Caenorhabditis elegans and to impact on age-related diseases in humans. We 
discuss CRTC deregulation as a new driver of aging that integrates the link 
between age and disease risk.

Running is a popular and convenient leisure-time physical activity (PA) with a 
significant impact on longevity. In general, runners have a 25%-40% reduced risk 
of premature mortality and live approximately 3 years longer than non-runners. 
Recently, specific questions have emerged regarding the extent of the health 
benefits of running versus other types of PA, and perhaps more critically, 
whether there are diminishing returns on health and mortality outcomes with 
higher amounts of running. This review details the findings surrounding the 
impact of running on various health outcomes and premature mortality, highlights 
plausible underlying mechanisms linking running with chronic disease prevention 
and longevity, identifies the estimated additional life expectancy among runners 
and other active individuals, and discusses whether there is adequate evidence 
to suggest that longevity benefits are attenuated with higher doses of running.

In order to provide a common standard for the treatment of mycosis fungoides 
(MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS), the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer-Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force (EORTC-CLTF) published in 2006 
its consensus recommendations for the stage-adapted selection of management 
options for these neoplasms. Since then, the understanding of the 
pathophysiology and epidemiology of MF/SS has advanced, the staging system has 
been revised, new outcome data have been published and novel treatment options 
have been introduced. The purpose of the present document is to update the 
original recommendations bearing in mind that there are still only a limited 
number of controlled studies to support treatment decisions for MF/SS and that 
often treatment is determined by institutional experience and availability. This 
consensus on treatment recommendations was established among the authors through 
a series of consecutive consultations in writing and a round of discussion. 
Recommended treatment options are presented according to disease stage, whenever 
possible categorised into first- and second-line options and supported with 
levels of evidence as devised by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 
(OCEBM). Skin-directed therapies are still the most appropriate option for 
early-stage MF, and most patients can look forward to a normal life expectancy. 
For patients with advanced disease, prognosis is still grim, and only for a 
highly selected subset of patients, prolonged survival can be achieved with 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). There is a high need for the 
development and investigation in controlled clinical trials of treatment options 
that are based on our increasing understanding of the molecular pathology of 
MF/SS.

Giant cell tumour of bone in the denosumab era.

Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is an intermediate locally aggressive primary 
bone tumour, occurring mostly at the meta-epiphysis of long bones. 
Overexpression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) by 
mononuclear neoplastic stromal cells promotes recruitment of numerous reactive 
multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, causing lacunar bone resorption. 
Preferential treatment is curettage with local adjuvants such as phenol, alcohol 
or liquid nitrogen. The remaining cavity may be filled with bone graft or 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement; benefits of the latter are a lower 
risk of recurrence, possibility of direct weight bearing and early radiographic 
detection of recurrences. Reported recurrence rates are comparable for the 
different local adjuvants (27-31%). Factors increasing the local recurrence risk 
include soft tissue extension and anatomically difficult localisations such as 
the sacrum. When joint salvage is impossible, en-bloc resection and 
endoprosthetic joint replacement may be performed. Local tumour control on the 
one hand and maintenance of a functional native joint and quality of life on the 
other hand are the main pillars of surgical treatment for this disease. Current 
knowledge and development in the fields of imaging, functional biology and 
systemic therapy are forcing us into a paradigm shift from a purely surgical 
approach towards a multidisciplinary approach. Systemic therapy with denosumab 
(RANKL inhibitor) or zoledronic acid (bisphosphonates) blocks, respectively 
inhibits, bone resorption by osteoclast-like giant cells. After use of 
zoledronic acid, stabilisation of local and metastatic disease has been 
reported, although the level of evidence is low. Denosumab is more extensively 
studied in two prospective trials, and appears effective for the optimisation of 
surgical treatment. Denosumab should be considered in the standard 
multidisciplinary treatment of advanced GCTB (e.g. cortical destruction, soft 
tissue extension, joint involvement or sacral localisation) to facilitate 
surgery at a later stage, and thereby aiming at immediate local control. Even 
though several questions concerning optimal treatment dose, duration and 
interval and drug safety remain unanswered, denosumab is among the most 
effective drug therapies in oncology.

AIMS: Although serum complement factor 3 (C3) is an acute phase reactant mainly 
synthesized in the liver, several recent studies have shown high C3 gene 
expression in adipose tissue (AT). However, the relationship between C3 and AT 
levels has not been fully clarified in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
METHODS: A total of 164 T2DM patients (109men and 55 women) participated in this 
cross-sectional study. A computed tomography scan was performed to measure 
visceral, subcutaneous, and total AT. The correlation between these factors and 
C3 levels was examined using Pearson's correlation analysis. A multivariate 
regression model was used to assess an independent determinant associated with 
C3 levels after adjusting the explanatory variables (i.e., all ATs [visceral, 
subcutaneous, and total], and clinical features [sex, age, body mass index, 
waist circumference, glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, aspartate aminotransferase levels, alanine 
aminotransferase levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, log(triglyceride levels), estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, and log(high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels)]).
RESULTS: Serum C3 levels were correlated with visceral, subcutaneous, and total 
AT among both men (r=0.505, p<0.001; r=0.545, p<0.001; r=0.617, p<0.001, 
respectively) and women (r=0.396, p=0.003; r=0.517, p<0.001; r=0.548, p<0.001, 
respectively). In the multivariate regression model, the association between 
total AT and C3 levels remained significantly positive (β=0.490, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum C3 levels are associated with visceral, subcutaneous, and 
total AT in T2DM patients. Furthermore, C3 levels seem to be a marker for 
overall adiposity rather than regional adiposity.

OBJECTIVE: Survival and causes of death (COD) in multiple sclerosis (MS) provide 
ultimate endpoints. We aimed to investigate survival and COD in a 60-year 
population-based MS cohort compared with the general population.
METHODS: All patients with incident multiple sclerosis (MS) (N=1388) with onset 
during 1953-2012 in Hordaland County, Western Norway, were included. Data were 
obtained from patient records at Haukeland University Hospital and linked to the 
Norwegian COD registry. Survival adjusted for sex, age and disease course were 
estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses from birth and from disease onset. Mortality 
and COD in MS relative to the general population were examined by standardised 
mortality ratio (SMR).
RESULTS: Of 1388 patients, 291 had deceased, mainly of MS (56.4%). Median life 
expectancy was 74.7 years for MS and 81.8 years for the general population 
(p<0.001); 77.2 years for women with MS and 72.2 years for men with MS 
(p<0.001). Life expectancy for patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) was 
77.8 years and -71.4 years for primary progressive MS (PPMS) (p<0.001). Overall 
SMR was 2.7 (p>0.0001); 2.9 in women and 2.5 in men (p=0.0009). SMR was 2.4 in 
RRMS and 3.9 in PPMS (p<0.0001). SMR from disease onset during 1953-1974 was 
3.1; 2.6 during 1975-1996 and 0.7 during 1997-2012 (p<0.0083). No difference in 
cause-specific deaths were found (p=0.0871).
CONCLUSION: We found a 7-year shorter life expectancy and almost threefold 
higher mortality in MS compared with the general population. A rise in survival 
in MS was observed during the entire observation period.

This study provides detailed data on the current characteristics, perceptions 
and outcomes of 45 young people with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they transition 
into adulthood. Although many had severe disease, they generally coped well, 
found attendance at a transition clinic helpful and welcomed the increased 
independence of an adult healthcare environment. Levels of psychological 
distress were low with only 15.6% having anxiety and 6.7% depression. The main 
psychological coping strategy used was optimistic acceptance. Overall, most 
remained stable after transfer but 33% had some decline in lung function and 9% 
in nutritional status, requiring intensification of treatment. They had high 
levels of satisfaction with their relationships and life situations and 76% were 
in employment or education. These results are encouraging and as life expectancy 
improves, young adults with CF are coping well with transition into adulthood.

Demographic data on wild chimpanzees are crucial for understanding the evolution 
of chimpanzee and hominin life histories, but most data come from populations 
affected by disease outbreaks and anthropogenic disturbance. We present 
survivorship data from a relatively undisturbed and exceptionally large 
community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, 
Kibale National Park, Uganda. We monitored births, deaths, immigrations, and 
emigrations in the community between 1995 and 2016. Using known and estimated 
ages, we calculated survivorship curves for the whole community, for males and 
females separately, and for individuals ≤2 years old when identified. We used a 
novel method to address age estimation error by calculating stochastic 
survivorship curves. We compared Ngogo life expectancy, survivorship, and 
mortality rates to those from other chimpanzee communities and human 
hunter-gatherers. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 32.8 
years, far exceeding estimates of chimpanzee life expectancy in other 
communities, and falling within the range of human hunter-gatherers (i.e., 27-37 
years). Overall, the pattern of survivorship at Ngogo was more similar to that 
of human hunter-gatherers than to other chimpanzee communities. Maximum lifespan 
for the Ngogo chimpanzees, however, was similar to that reported at other 
chimpanzee research sites and was less than that of human-hunter gatherers. The 
absence of predation by large carnivores may contribute to some of the higher 
survivorship at Ngogo, but this cannot explain the much higher survivorship at 
Ngogo than at Kanyawara, another chimpanzee community in the same forest, which 
also lacks large carnivores. Higher survivorship at Ngogo appears to be an 
adaptive response to a food supply that is more abundant and varies less than 
that of Kanyawara. Future analyses of hominin life history evolution should take 
these results into account.

BACKGROUND: The Hospital-patient One-year Mortality Risk (HOMR) score is an 
externally validated index using health administrative data to accurately 
predict the risk of death within 1 year of admission to the hospital. This study 
derived and internally validated a HOMR modification using data that are 
available when the patient is admitted to the hospital.
METHODS: From all adult hospitalizations at our tertiary-care teaching hospital 
between 2004 and 2015, we randomly selected one per patient. We added to all 
HOMR variables that could be determined from our hospital's data systems on 
admission other factors that might prognosticate. Vital statistics registries 
determined vital status at 1 year from admission.
RESULTS: Of 2,06,396 patients, 32,112 (15.6%) died within 1 year of admission to 
the hospital. The HOMR-now! model included patient (sex, comorbidities, living 
and cancer clinic status, and 1-year death risk from population-based life 
tables) and hospitalization factors (admission year, urgency, service and 
laboratory-based acuity score). The model explained that more than half of the 
total variability (Regenkirke's R2 value of 0.53) was very discriminative 
(C-statistic 0.92), and accurately predicted death risk (calibration slope 
0.98).
CONCLUSION: One-year risk of death can be accurately predicted using routinely 
collected data available when patients are admitted to the hospital.

The life expectancy of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing due 
to advances in medicine and technology. As a result, there is a higher incidence 
of age-associated illnesses in this population. Degenerative joint disease is a 
common age-associated illness that causes pain and thus, in persons with SCI 
above the T6 level, can serve as a noxious stimulus to trigger autonomic 
dysreflexia (AD). This is a case report of severe bilateral hip osteoarthritis 
(OA) causing unyielding AD in a person with tetraplegia leading to bilateral 
girdle stone surgeries. Hip OA as an etiology for AD has not previously been 
reported and is important to recognize as this population continues to age and 
to develop age-associated diseases.

PURPOSE: To develop a multidisciplinary algorithmic approach to management of 
women aged ≥70 years with clinically staged T1N0 hormone receptor-positive 
breast cancer, including geriatric assessments predicting life expectancy and 
the likelihood of functional decline in the near future, in the context of a 
program-wide quality improvement initiative, to better select patients for 
therapeutic interventions.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two geriatric assessment tools, the Combined 
Lee-Schonberg Index and the Vulnerable Elderly Scale, were introduced into our 
clinical workflow to predict long-term mortality and likelihood of functional 
decline. Scores from these tools, along with patient preferences and clinical 
features, were incorporated into a preoperative algorithm addressing the use of 
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and a postoperative algorithm addressing the 
use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).
RESULTS: The algorithms were approved for use in August 2015. Twenty-four 
patients were identified by in-clinic screening and have been managed using the 
algorithms as a guide. Mean patient age was 80 years (range, 71-89 years). Per 
the preoperative algorithm, consideration of omission of SLNB was an option in 
11 of 24 patients (46%), and in total 18 of 24 (75%) opted against SLNB. Per the 
postsurgical algorithm, consideration of omission of adjuvant RT was an option 
for 19 of 24 patients (79%), and in total 17 of 24 (71%) opted to forego RT.
CONCLUSION: Incorporation of simple geriatric assessments seems to have had a 
marked impact on decision making regarding both surgical and adjuvant therapies 
for women aged ≥70 years with early-stage hormone-positive breast cancer 
compared with historical patterns, with ≥71% omission of both SLNB and adjuvant 
RT in patients managed according to an institutional quality improvement 
initiative.

PURPOSE: To examine the frequency of guideline-concordant cancer care in elderly 
patients, including "older" elderly (age ≥80 years).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End 
Results-Medicare dataset in patients aged ≥66 years diagnosed with nonmetastatic 
breast cancer (n=55,094), non-small cell lung (NSCLC) (n=36,203), or prostate 
cancer (n=86,544) from 2006 to 2011, chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation (RT) 
treatments were identified using claims. Pearson χ2 tested associations between 
age and guideline concordance.
RESULTS: Older patients were less likely to receive guideline-concordant 
curative treatment: in stage III breast cancer, receipt of postmastectomy RT 
(70%, 46%, and 21% in patients aged 66-79, 80-89, and ≥90 years, respectively; 
P<.0001); in stage I NSCLC, RT or surgery (89%, 80%, and 64% in age 66-79, 
80-89, and ≥90 years; P<.0001); in stage III NSCLC, RT or surgery plus 
chemotherapy (79%, 58%, and 27% in age 66-79, 80-89, and ≥90 years; P<.0001); 
and in intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer, RT or prostatectomy (projected 
life expectancy >10 years: 85% and 82% in age 66-69 and 70-75 years; and 
≤10 years: 70%, 42%, and 9% in age 76-79, 80-89, and ≥90 years; P<.0001). 
However, older patients were more likely to receive guideline-concordant 
de-intensified treatment: in stage I to II node-negative breast cancer, 
hypofractionated postlumpectomy RT (9%, 16%, and 23% in age 66-79, 80-89, and 
≥90 years; P<.0001); in stage I estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, 
observation after lumpectomy (12%, 42%, and 84% in age 66-79, 80-89, and 
≥90 years; P<.0001); in stage I NSCLC, stereotactic body RT instead of surgery 
(7%, 16%, and 25% in age 66-79, 80-89, and ≥90 years; P<.0001); and in 
lower-risk prostate cancer, no active treatment (25%, 54%, and 68% in age 66-79, 
80-89, and ≥90 years; P<.0001).
CONCLUSION: Actual treatment of older elderly cancer patients frequently 
diverged from guidelines, especially in curative treatment of advanced disease. 
Results suggest a need for better metrics than existing guidelines alone to 
evaluate quality and appropriateness of care in this population.

PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of evolocumab in 
patients at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events from the Spanish National 
Health System perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness (incremental 
[∆] cost per ∆ quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]; or cost utility) of evolocumab 
plus standard of care (SoC; statins) versus SoC, assuming lifetime treatment. 
Cohorts with baseline LDL-C >100 mg/dL and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or 
CV event history (secondary prevention [SP]) were considered. Lifetime CV event 
rates were predicted either (1) using risk equations considering local risk 
factors (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) adjusted to reflect 
the increased risk of FH patients or (2) using CV event rates from local 
registries (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) 
for SP patients. LDL-C relative reductions from evolocumab trials (Evolocumab 
140 mg Q2W (bi-weekly) and 420 mg QM (monthly)) were converted into CV event 
reductions using rate ratios per millimole per liter (mmol/L; 38.67 mg/dL) from 
a meta-analysis of statin trials (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' 
Collaboration).
FINDINGS: Predicted 10-year/lifetime CV risks were 50%/95% (FH) and 62%/82% (SP) 
for SoC and 27%/83% (FH) and 44%/69% (SP) for evolocumab plus SoC. Predicted 
10-year/lifetime major CV event risks were 42%/86% (FH) and 47%/67% (SP) for SoC 
and 21%/68% (FH) and 31%/52% (SP) for evolocumab plus SoC. Predicted per 
patient-year rates of non-fatal/fatal CV events were 2.2/0.8 (FH) and 1.1/0.6 
(SP) for SoC and 1.2/0.6 (FH) and 0.7/0.5 (SP) for evolocumab plus SoC. 
Predicted CV event reductions per mmol/L were 17% (FH) and 15% (SP). Evolocumab 
treatment was associated with increased QALYs and costs compared with SoC (FH: 
∆cost, €65,369; ∆QALY, 2.12; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], 
€30,893; SP: ∆cost, €42,266; ∆QALY, 0.93; ICER, €45,340).
IMPLICATIONS: Evolocumab plus to SoC may provide a cost-effective option for 
LDL-C lowering in FH and SP patients in Spain.

Gut microbiota play key roles in host nutrition and metabolism. However, little 
is known about the relationship between host genetics, gut microbiota and 
metabolic profiles. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry approaches to characterize the microbiota 
composition and the metabolite profiles in the gut of five cyprinid fish species 
with three different feeding habits raised under identical husbandry conditions. 
Our results showed that host species and feeding habits significantly affect not 
only gut microbiota composition but also metabolite profiles (ANOSIM, p ≤ 0.05). 
Mantel test demonstrated that host phylogeny, gut microbiota, and metabolite 
profiles were significantly related to each other (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, the 
carps with the same feeding habits had more similarity in gut microbiota 
composition and metabolite profiles. Various metabolites were correlated 
positively with bacterial taxa involved in food degradation. Our results shed 
new light on the microbiome and metabolite profiles in the gut content of 
cyprinid fishes, and highlighted the correlations between host genotype, fish 
gut microbiome and putative functions, and gut metabolite profiles.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated obesity rates are a major contributor to the significantly 
reduced life expectancy impacting people with serious mental illness. With over 
1.5 billion Facebook users worldwide, this platform may afford opportunities for 
reaching individuals with serious mental illness outside professional settings 
and fostering social support for adopting healthier behaviors. In this mixed 
methods pilot study, we explored the feasibility and acceptability of using 
Facebook to support a group lifestyle intervention for weight loss among obese 
adults with serious mental illness.
METHODS: Nine of eleven participants enrolled in a six-month lifestyle 
intervention delivered through a community mental health center agreed to join a 
private Facebook group to support their healthy eating and exercise goals. We 
measured participants' use of the Facebook group and collected post-intervention 
feasibility and acceptability questionnaires followed by in-depth qualitative 
interviews to elicit participants' perspectives and recommendations for 
improving the use of Facebook.
RESULTS: Of 188 posts to the Facebook group, the majority (79%) were from 
participants compared to study staff (21%). Participants also posted 186 
comments, 299 likes, and recorded 1316 page views. Participants were positive 
about opportunities to interact and support each other outside group sessions, 
found content posted by other participants to be helpful, and indicated that the 
Facebook group was safe to use. Participants provided constructive feedback, 
including recommendations for more detailed instructions for accessing the group 
and posting content, finding ways to encourage more interaction within the 
group, and tips for responding to notifications or alerts directly from the 
Facebook website.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Facebook may be feasible for supporting 
health promotion efforts targeting people with serious mental illness. 
Participants provided valuable feedback that can inform the use of Facebook for 
future health promotion efforts targeting this high-risk group.

In the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, queens and workers have different 
longevity although they share the same genome. Queens consume royal jelly (RJ) 
as the main food throughout their life, including as adults, but workers only 
eat worker jelly when they are larvae less than 3 days old. In order to explore 
the effect of RJ and the components affecting longevity of worker honey bees, we 
first determined the optimal dose for prolonging longevity of workers as 4% RJ 
in 50% sucrose solution, and developed a method of obtaining long lived workers. 
We then compared the effects of longevity extension by RJ 4% with bee-collected 
pollen from rapeseed (Brassica napus). Lastly, we determined that a water 
soluble RJ protein obtained by precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate (RJP60) 
contained the main component for longevity extension after comparing the effects 
of RJ crude protein extract (RJCP), RJP30 (obtained by precipitation with 30% 
ammonium sulfate), and RJ ethanol extract (RJEE). Understanding what regulates 
worker longevity has potential to help increase colony productivity and improve 
crop pollination efficiency.

BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against PCSK9, 
significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in 
Japanese patients by up to 76% when administered with a statin. We evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of 1 year of evolocumab in a pooled analysis of patients 
from the 12-week YUKAWA studies who continued into the open-label extension 
(OLE) OSLER studies.Methods and Results:YUKAWA-1 and YUKAWA-2 were conducted in 
hypercholesterolemic, high-cardiovascular-risk Japanese patients who were 
receiving statin therapy. Patients completing these studies were eligible for an 
OLE study. At OLE entry, patients were re-randomized 2:1 to evolocumab+standard 
of care (SOC) or SOC alone (OSLER-1: evolocumab 420 mg monthly; OSLER-2: 
evolocumab 140 mg biweekly or 420 mg monthly). A 1-year analysis was performed 
on patients enrolled from the YUKAWA studies into OSLER. At parent-study 
baseline (YUKAWA-1 or YUKAWA-2 patients continuing into OSLER), mean (SD) age 
was 61 (10) years; 39% were female; mean (SD) baseline LDL-C (on statin) was 
119.7 (33.0) mg/dL. Overall rates of adverse events were comparable between 
evolocumab+SOC and SOC alone. In YUKAWA patients receiving evolocumab+SOC, mean 
(SE) reductions in LDL-C from parent-study baseline to OLE 1 year were 69.1% 
(1.2%; OSLER-1) and 65.1% (2.2%; OSLER-2).
CONCLUSIONS: In a pooled 1-year analysis of Japanese patients in the ongoing 
OSLER studies, treatment with evolocumab+SOC was well tolerated and resulted in 
sustained LDL-C reductions at 1 year.

[How did Japanese rural dwellers become rapidly healthier in the two decades 
following World War II?: Examining the diverse policy interventions that 
improved the population's health].

[Article in Japanese]

University.

Objective　During the two decades following Japan's World War II surrender in 
1945, tremendous improvement in the population's health was observed, 
particularly in infant mortality and life expectancy. How did Japanese rural 
dwellers achieve such remarkable health improvement during this relatively short 
time span while its economy remained heavily damaged following the war? While 
the efforts from government-driven public health strategies and programs are 
well known, relatively little is known about the contributions of policies in 
non-health sectors. Therefore, the main aim is to verify, using literature based 
sources, whether non-health sectors contributed to the betterment of the 
population's health in addition to the public health sector 
policies.Hypotheses　Synergistic efforts of diverse interventions from different 
policies and programs likely catalyzed the drastic health improvement observed 
in the Japanese population in the two decades after World War II. The Ministry 
of Health and Welfare, for example, implemented programs to provide health care 
services. These are thought to have contributed directly to reducing maternal 
and child mortality, as well as tuberculosis-related mortality. Additionally, 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry carried out a nationwide livelihood 
improvement program to enhance individual and family lifestyles, improve indoor 
and outdoor environments, and strengthen social solidarity. The ministry also 
attempted to generate income stability for farmers through an agricultural 
improvement program to ensure allocation of household income to family health. 
The Ministry of Education also had an initiative to disseminate the concepts of 
democracy and rational thought to the Japanese population through a social 
education program. Through these efforts, superstition and pre-modern customs 
were reduced, and subsequently health awareness increased, leading to an 
improvement in the population's health.Conclusion　The public health policies 
implemented in Japan as well as the integration of various policies and programs 
addressing livelihoods, economics, and education greatly improved the 
population's health in a relatively short time. These non-health initiatives 
intersected with a wide range of health determinants. Verifying these hypotheses 
in detail would help develop effective measures for international aid to 
poverty-stricken regions. It also encourages alternative ways through which 
Japan could overcome its present-day challenges such as a rapidly aging 
population with limited access to national schemes for social security.

INTRODUCTION: The US Food and Drug Administration allows a previously unapproved 
device to be used clinically to collect safety and effectiveness data under 
their Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) category. The process usually falls 
under 3 different trial categories: noninferiority, equivalency, and 
superiority. To confidently inform our patients, understanding the basic 
concepts of these trials is paramount. The purpose of this manuscript was to 
provide a comprehensive review of these topics using recently published IDE 
trials and economic analyses of cervical total disc replacement as illustrative
