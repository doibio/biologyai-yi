BACKGROUND: Disease burden is not evenly distributed within a population; this 
uneven distribution can be due to individual heterogeneity in progression rates 
between disease stages. Composite measures of disease burden that are based on 
disease progression models, such as the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), 
are widely used to quantify the current and future burden of infectious 
diseases. Our goal was to investigate to what extent ignoring the presence of 
heterogeneity could bias DALY computation.
METHODS: Simulations using individual-based models for hypothetical infectious 
diseases with short and long natural histories were run assuming either 
"population-averaged" progression probabilities between disease stages, or 
progression probabilities that were influenced by an a priori defined 
individual-level frailty (i.e., heterogeneity in disease risk) distribution, and 
DALYs were calculated.
RESULTS: Under the assumption of heterogeneity in transition rates and 
increasing frailty with age, the short natural history disease model predicted 
14% fewer DALYs compared with the homogenous population assumption. Simulations 
of a long natural history disease indicated that assuming homogeneity in 
transition rates when heterogeneity was present could overestimate total DALYs, 
in the present case by 4% (95% quantile interval: 1-8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of ignoring population heterogeneity should be 
considered when defining transition parameters for natural history models and 
when interpreting the resulting disease burden estimates.

The endocrine system plays a major role in the regulation of several biological 
activity and in the ageing process. Evolutionary conservation of 
GH/IGF-I/insulin pathway from worms to mice and similarities in this system 
between mice and humans raised expectations that downregulated activity of the 
GH/IGF-I/insulin pathway could be beneficial for the extension of human life 
span. Centenarians represent the best example of successful ageing having 
reached the very extremes of the human life span, escaping and delaying the 
occurrence of several fatal age-related diseases, such as cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases. This review describes the endocrine profile of 
centenarians concerning the GH/IGF-I/insulin system, focusing on the relevance 
of this pathway on the modulation of ageing and longevity.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal codominantly inherited 
disease. The severity of clinical presentation depends on the zygosity of the 
mutations in the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes. The homozygous form (HoFH) is 
associated with high mortality rate by third decade of life, while individuals 
with HeFH begin to suffer from premature cardiovascular disease in fourth or 
fifth decade of life. Statin drugs have helped to improve the biochemical 
profile and life expectancy in HeFH, while they are only minimally effective in 
HoFH. LDL apheresis remains an effective treatment option in HoFH, though 
limited by its availability and affordability issues. We present the case that 
highlights a few novel aspects of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in FH, 
wherein a child presented with features of both HeFH and HoFH. His clinical 
picture was that of HoFH; however he responded well clinically and biochemically 
to pharmacologic treatment only. DNA sequencing showed a novel heterozygous rare 
splicing variant in the LDLR gene in addition to a relatively high polygenic 
trait score comprised of LDL-C raising alleles from common polymorphic sites. 
Interestingly his normolipemic mother showed the same heterozygous mutation. 
Thus this novel splicing variant in LDLR showed nonclassical co-segregation with 
the disease phenotype and was associated with a high polygenic trait score 
comprised of common LDL-C raising polymorphic alleles in the affected proband. 
Thus it indicates the phenotypic heterogeneity of FH and suggests that secondary 
causes, such as polygenic factors and possibly as yet undetermined genetic or 
environmental factors, can exacerbate the metabolic phenotype in an individual 
who is genotypically heterozygous for FH.

Patients with HCV genotype 3 (GT3) infection and cirrhosis are currently the 
most difficult to cure. We report our experience with sofosbuvir+daclatasvir 
(SOF+DCV) or sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), with or without ribavirin (RBV) in 
clinical practice in this population. This was a multicenter observational study 
including cirrhotic patients infected by HCV GT3, treated with sofosbuvir plus 
an NS5A inhibitor (May 2014-October 2015). In total, 208 patients were included: 
98 (47%) treatment-experienced, 42 (20%) decompensated and 55 (27%) MELD score 
>10. In 131 (63%), treatment was SOF+DCV and in 77 (37%), SOF/LDV. Overall, 86% 
received RBV. RBV addition and extension to 24 weeks was higher in the SOF/LDV 
group (95% vs 80%, P=.002 and 83% vs 72%, P=.044, respectively). A higher 
percentage of decompensated patients were treated with DCV than LDV (25% vs 12%, 
P=.013). Overall, SVR12 was 93.8% (195/208): 94% with SOF+DCV and 93.5% with 
SOF/LDV. SVR12 was achieved in 90.5% of decompensated patients. Eleven treatment 
failures: 10 relapses and one breakthrough. RBV addition did not improve SVR 
(RR: 1.08; P=.919). The single factor associated with failure to achieve SVR was 
platelet count <75×10E9/mL (RR: 3.50, P=.019). In patients with MELD <10, type 
of NS5A inhibitor did not impact on SVR12 (94% vs 97%; adjusted RR: 0.49). 
Thirteen patients (6.3%) had serious adverse events, including three deaths 
(1.4%) and one therapy discontinuation (0.5%), higher in decompensated patients 
(16.7% vs 3.6%, P<.006). In patients with GT3 infection and cirrhosis, SVR12 
rates were high with both SOF+DCV and SOF/LDV, with few serious adverse events.

AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of reduced life expectancy in 
type 1 diabetes (T1D). Intensive insulin therapy prevents CV complications but 
is constrained by hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Adjunct metformin reduces 
insulin dose requirement and stabilizes weight but there are no data on its 
cardiovascular effects. We have therefore initiated an international 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (REMOVAL: REducing with 
MetfOrmin Vascular Adverse Lesions in type 1 diabetes) to examine whether 
metformin reduces progression of atherosclerosis in adults with T1D. Individuals 
≥40 years of age with T1D for ≥5 years are eligible if they have ≥3 of 10 
specified CV risk factors. The enrolment target is 500 participants in 17 
international centres.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 12 weeks of single-blind placebo-controlled run-in, 
participants with ≥ 70% adherence are randomized to metformin or matching 
placebo for 3 years with insulin titrated towards HbA1c 7.0% (53 mmol/mol). The 
primary endpoint is progression of averaged mean far wall common carotid 
intima-media thickness (cIMT) measured by ultrasonography at baseline, 12, 24 
and 36 months. This design provides 90% power to detect a mean difference of 
0.0167 mm in cIMT progression between treatment arms (α = 0.05), assuming that 
up to 20% withdraw or discontinue treatment. Other endpoints include HbA1c, 
weight, LDL cholesterol, insulin requirement, progression of retinopathy, 
endothelial function and frequency of hypoglycaemia.
CONCLUSION: REMOVAL is the largest clinical trial of adjunct metformin therapy 
in T1D to date and will provide clinically meaningful information on its 
potential to impact CV disease and other complications.

BACKGROUND: An evaluation was conducted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
insufflation of warmed humidified CO2 during open and laparoscopic colorectal 
surgery compared with usual care from a UK NHS perspective.
METHODS: Decision analytic models were developed for open and laparoscopic 
surgery. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated. 
The open surgery model used data on the incidence of intra-operative hypothermia 
and applied risks of complications for hypothermia and normothermia. The 
laparoscopic surgery model utilised data describing complications directly. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, insufflation of warmed humidified CO2 
dominated. For open surgery, savings of £20 and incremental QALYs of 0.013 were 
estimated per patient. For laparoscopic surgery, savings of £345 and incremental 
QALYs of 0.001 per patient were estimated. Results were robust to most 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the current evidence base, the intervention is likely 
to be cost-effective compared with usual care in patients undergoing colorectal 
surgery.

Survival is a fundamental demographic component and the importance of its 
accurate estimation goes beyond the traditional estimation of life expectancy. 
The evolutionary stability of isomorphic biphasic life-cycles and the occurrence 
of its different ploidy phases at uneven abundances are hypothesized to be 
driven by differences in survival rates between haploids and diploids. We 
monitored Gracilaria chilensis, a commercially exploited red alga with an 
isomorphic biphasic life-cycle, having found density-dependent survival with 
competition and Allee effects. While estimating the linear-in-the-parameters 
survival function, all model I regression methods (i.e, vertical least squares) 
provided biased line-fits rendering them inappropriate for studies about 
ecology, evolution or population management. Hence, we developed an iterative 
two-step non-linear model II regression (i.e, oblique least squares), which 
provided improved line-fits and estimates of survival function parameters, while 
robust to the data aspects that usually turn the regression methods numerically 
unstable.

There is a link between the pregnancy and its long-term influence on health and 
susceptibility to future chronic disease both in mother and offspring. The 
objective was to determine whether individual counseling on physical activity 
and diet and weight gain at five antenatal visits can prevent type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and overweight or improve glycemic parameters, among all 
at-risk-mothers and their children. Another objective was to evaluate whether 
gestational lifestyle intervention was cost-effective as measured with mother's 
sickness absence and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). This study was a 
seven-year follow-up study for women, who were enrolled to the antenatal 
cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT). Analysis of the outcome included all 
women whose outcome was available, in addition with subgroup analysis including 
women adherent to all lifestyle aims. A total of 173 women with their children 
participated to the study, representing 43% (173/399) of the women who finished 
the original RCT. Main outcome measures were: T2DM based on medication use or 
fasting blood glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), body mass index 
(BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). None of the women were diagnosed to have 
T2DM. HbA1c or fasting blood glucose differences were not found among mothers or 
children. Differences in BMI were non-significant among mothers (Intervention 
27.3, Usual care 28.1 kg/m2, p = 0.33) and children (I 21.3 vs U 22.5 kg/m2, p = 
0.07). Children's BMI was significantly lower among adherent group (I 20.5 vs U 
22.5, p = 0.04). The mean total cost per person was 30.6% lower in the 
intervention group than in the usual care group (I €2,944 vs. U €4,243; p = 
0.74). Intervention was cost-effective in terms of sickness absence but not in 
QALY gained i.e. if society is willing to pay additional €100 per one avoided 
sickness absence day; there is a 90% probability of the intervention arm to be 
cost-effective. Long-term effectiveness of antenatal lifestyle counseling was 
not shown, in spite of possible effect on children's BMI. Cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention in terms of sickness absence may have larger societal impact.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol relapses after liver transplantation (LT) constitute a 
critical issue. Because there is no widely accepted definition of LT, its 
prevalence varies from 7 to 95% across studies. Only a severe relapse, the 
frequency of which is estimated to be 11 to 26%, decreases life expectancy after 
5 years of LT and requires specific care. To improve the early identification of 
alcohol consumption among transplanted patients, liver transplant teams may be 
helped by input from an addiction team. Nevertheless, added benefit of 
involvement by addiction specialists in treating posttransplant patients has not 
been demonstrated. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the evaluation of 
the alcohol consumption after LT performed routinely during the transplant 
consultation or obtained from a specific addiction consultation.
METHODS: This was a prospective single-site study. Patients were seen 
consecutively by their hepatologist and by an addiction specialist, and they 
completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C). 
Thus, the patient's alcohol status was assessed using 3 different sources of 
information: the hepatologist's interview, the AUDIT-C score, and the addiction 
specialist visit.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients were consecutively evaluated. Alcohol 
consumption was identified by the hepatologist in 31 patients (21.9%), in 52 
(36.8%) using the AUDIT-C questionnaire, and in 58 (41.1%) by the addiction 
specialist. The 31 patients concerned reported an average of 6.5 alcohol 
units/wk to the transplant physician, a number which was significantly greater 
(p = 0.001) by 8.6 units/wk when they were interviewed by the addiction 
specialist.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the clinical utility of a systematic 
addiction consultation among liver transplant patients, irrespective of the 
reason for transplantation.

Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are typically assayed in vitro with 5-10 mM Mg2+, 
whereas the free Mg2+ concentration in cells is much lower. Artificially high 
Mg2+ concentrations used in vitro can misrepresent different properties of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RT, including fidelity, catalysis, pausing, and 
RNase H activity. Here, we analyzed nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside RT 
inhibitors (NNRTIs) in primer extension assays at different concentrations of 
free Mg2+. At low concentrations of Mg2+, NRTIs and dideoxynucleotides (AZTTP, 
ddCTP, ddGTP, and 3TCTP) inhibited HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT synthesis less efficiently 
than they did with large amounts of Mg2+, whereas inhibition by the 
"translocation-defective RT inhibitor" EFdA 
(4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine) was unaffected by Mg2+ concentrations. 
Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that the reduced level of inhibition at 
low Mg2+ concentrations resulted from a 3-9-fold (depending on the particular 
nucleotide and inhibitor) less efficient incorporation (based on kcat/Km) of 
these NRTIs under this condition compared to incorporation of natural dNTPs. In 
contrast, EFdATP was incorporated with an efficiency similar to that of its 
analogue dATP at low Mg2+ concentrations. Unlike NRTIs, NNRTIs (nevirapine, 
efavirenz, and rilviripine), were approximately 4-fold (based on IC50 values) 
more effective at low than at high Mg2+ concentrations. Drug-resistant HIV-1 RT 
mutants also displayed the Mg2+-dependent difference in susceptibility to NRTIs 
and NNRTIs. In summary, analyzing the efficiency of inhibitors under more 
physiologically relevant low-Mg2+ conditions yielded results dramatically 
different from those from measurements using commonly employed high-Mg2+ in 
vitro conditions. These results also emphasize differences in Mg2+ sensitivity 
between the translocation inhibitor EFdATP and other NRTIs.

Drug discovery is usually focused on a single protein target; in this process, 
existing compounds that bind to related proteins are often ignored. We describe 
ProBiS plugin, extension of our earlier ProBiS-ligands approach, which for a 
given protein structure allows prediction of its binding sites and, for each 
binding site, the ligands from similar binding sites in the Protein Data Bank. 
We developed a new database of precalculated binding site comparisons of about 
290000 proteins to allow fast prediction of binding sites in existing proteins. 
The plugin enables advanced viewing of predicted binding sites, ligands' poses, 
and their interactions in three-dimensional graphics. Using the InhA query 
protein, an enoyl reductase enzyme in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis fatty acid 
biosynthesis pathway, we predicted its possible ligands and assessed their 
inhibitory activity experimentally. This resulted in three previously 
unrecognized inhibitors with novel scaffolds, demonstrating the plugin's utility 
in the early drug discovery process.

Cardiometabolic diseases of civilization: history and maturation of an evolving 
global threat. An update and call to action.

Despite striking extensions of lifespan, leading causes of death in most 
countries now constitute chronic, degenerative diseases which outpace the 
capacity of health systems. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of 
death in both developed and undeveloped countries. In America, nearly half of 
the adult population has at least one chronic disease, and polypharmacy is 
commonplace. Prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health has not meaningfully 
improved over the past two decades. The fall in cardiovascular deaths in Western 
countries, half due to a fall in risk factors and half due to improved 
treatments, have plateaued, and this reversal is due to the dual epidemics of 
obesity and diabetes type 2. High burdens of cardiovascular risk factors are 
also evident globally. Undeveloped nations bear the burdens of both infectious 
diseases and high childhood death rates. Unacceptable rates of morbidity and 
mortality arise from insufficient resources to improve sanitation, pure water, 
and hygiene, ultimately linked to poverty and disparities. Simultaneously, about 
80% of cardiovascular deaths now occur in low- and middle-income nations. For 
these reasons, risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, including poverty, 
health illiteracy, and lack of adherence, must be targeted with unprecedented 
vigor worldwide. Key messages In developed and relatively wealthy countries, 
chronic "degenerative" diseases have attained crisis proportions that threaten 
to reverse health gains made within the past decades. Although poverty, 
disparities, and poor sanitation still cause unnecessary death and despair in 
developing nations, they are now also burdened with increasing cardiovascular 
mortality. Poor adherence and low levels of health literacy contribute to the 
high background levels of cardiovascular risk.

OBJECTIVES: Imatinib (Glivec) and nilotinib (Tasigna) have been covered by 
critical disease insurance in Jiangsu province of China since 2013, which 
changed local treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML). This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
insurance coverage with imatinib as the first-line treatment for patients with 
CML in China from a societal perspective.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model based on previously published and real-world 
evidence was applied to simulate and evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic 
outcomes associated with CML treatments before and after imatinib was covered by 
medical insurance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated 
with both costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 3% 
annually. Different assumptions of treatment benefits and costs were taken to 
address uncertainties and were tested with sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, both cost and effectiveness of CML treatments 
increased after imatinib was covered by the medical insurance; on average, the 
incremental QALY and cost were 5.5 and ¥277,030 per patient in lifetime, 
respectively. The ICER of insurance coverage with imatinib was ¥50,641, which is 
less than the GDP per capita of China. Monte Carlo simulation resulted in the 
estimate of 100% probability that the insurance coverage of imatinib is 
cost-effective. Total cost was substantially saved at 5 years after patients 
initiated imatinib treatment with insurance coverage compared to no insurance 
coverage, the saved cost at 5 years was ¥99,565, which included the cost savings 
from both direct (e.g. cost of bone marrow or stem cell transplant) and indirect 
costs (e.g. productivity loss of patients and care-givers).
CONCLUSIONS: The insurance coverage of imatinib is very cost-effective in China, 
according to the local cost and clinical data in Jiangsu province. More 
importantly, the insurance coverage of imatinib and nilotinib have changed the 
treatment patterns of CML patients, thus dramatically increasing life expectancy 
and quality-of-life (QoL) saving on productivity losses for both CML patients 
and their caregivers.

Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) now account for more than one-half of the global 
burden of disease. Cardiovascular diseases account for about one-half of NCD 
deaths, and the majority of cardiovascular disease deaths occur in low- and 
middle-income countries. The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) study measures and 
benchmarks health loss from death or disability from more than 300 diseases in 
over 100 countries. According to GBD analyses, the rise of NCD is in part due to 
increased life expectancy due to reduced premature mortality from communicable, 
child, and maternal illnesses, but preventable risk factors also contribute and 
present targets for NCD control efforts. In addition to traditional NCD risk 
factors, like tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, and unhealthful diet, 
nontraditional risk factors like air pollution and unhealthful alcohol 
consumption also play a role. The GBD study continues to grow by gathering more 
data from country partners than ever before, and by measuring health at the 
national and subnational levels and in smaller time increments. The GBD study 
will continue to provide the data to set priorities for and measure progress in 
the global effort to control the rising burden of NCD.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy 
have a limited overall survival. Expectations and preferences of such patients 
towards palliative chemotherapy after explanation of disease prognosis and 
treatment options are unknown.
METHODS: This was a single arm, prospective, observational study where newly 
diagnosed head and neck cancer patients warranting palliative chemotherapy 
underwent protocol defined counselling. Following counselling, they were 
administered chemotherapy expectation and preference proforma (CEP). The primary 
objective of this study was to estimate the percentage of patients opting for an 
increase in survival as the primary expectation from chemotherapy.
RESULTS: We recruited two hundred patients all patients except one answered the 
CEP. Prolongation of life as the primary expectation from palliative 
chemotherapy was seen only in 82 patients (41.0%; 95% CI 34.4-47.9%). Symptom 
relief was the primary expectation or an equally important expectation amongst 
the remaining 117 patients (58.5%; 95% CI 51.6-65.1%). There was a statistically 
significant difference between the preferences of patients having a primary 
expectation of prolongation of life as opposed to symptom relief regarding the 
minimum expected number of patients need to treat to get prolongation of life (p 
value -0.00). The minimum expected increment in life expectancy for taking 
palliative chemotherapy was ">1year" in 190 patients (94.5%; 95% CI 91.5-97.7%).
CONCLUSION: The primary expectation from palliative chemotherapy in head and 
neck cancer patients is not necessarily living longer in all patients. The 
magnitude of benefit preferred by the patients from chemotherapy far exceeded 
the current standards for drug approval.

PURPOSE: To determine the most cost-effective treatment strategy for patients 
with massive rotator cuff tears and pseudoparalysis of the shoulder without 
osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint (PP without OA). Specifically, we aimed 
to compare arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) versus reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty (RTSA) and investigate the effect of patient age on this decision.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was used to compare 3 treatment strategies for 
addressing PP without OA: (1) ARCR with option to arthroscopically revise once, 
(2) ARCR with immediate conversion to RTSA on potential failure, and (3) primary 
RTSA. Hypothetical patients were cycled through the model according to 
transition probabilities, meanwhile accruing financial costs, utility for time 
in health states, and disutilities for surgical procedures. Utilities were 
derived from the Short Form-6D scale and expressed as quality-adjusted 
life-years. Model parameters were derived from the literature and from expert 
opinion, and thorough sensitivity analyses were conducted. TreeAge Pro 2015 
software was used to construct and assess the Markov model.
RESULTS: For the base-case scenario (60-year-old patient), ARCR with conversion 
to RTSA on potential failure was the most cost-effective strategy when we 
assumed equal utility for the ARCR and RTSA health states. Primary RTSA became 
cost-effective when the utility of RTSA exceeded that of ARCR by 0.04 
quality-adjusted life-years per year. Age at decision did not substantially 
change this result.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary ARCR with conversion to RTSA on potential failure was found 
to be the most cost-effective strategy for PP without OA. This result was 
independent of age. Primary ARCR with revision ARCR on potential failure was a 
less cost-effective strategy.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, economic and decision analysis.

This study aimed to evaluate the temporal and spacial distribution of the mucins 
produced by goblet cells and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) expression 
during the development of the small intestine of the rat. Intestines were 
removed from rats on the 15th, 17th and 18th days of intratuterine life (i.u.) 
and on the 3rd, 10th, 17th and 25th days after birth (a.b.). Intestines were 
processed for routine histological procedures and sections were submitted to 
histochemistry using PAS to stain neutral glycoproteins and Alcian blue for 
acidic glycoproteins, as well as immunohistochemistry to detect IAP. In rats, 
glycoprotein production was seen to begin in the intestinal epithelium cell at 
around the 17th day of i.u. life; however, this production was not accompanied 
by morphological indications of the presence of goblet cells. By the 18th i.u. 
day, the villus epithelium was undergoing differentiation and the first goblet 
cells could be identified from this time. At around the 10th day a.b., both 
compartments of the small intestine were detected; i.e. the villi and the 
crypts. At this timepoint, goblet cells were present in the villi, and also in 
the upper regions of the crypts. On the 3rd, 10th 17th and 25th days a.b., the 
presence of the goblet cells increased and presented regional differences in the 
sections evaluated. IAP was not detected during i.u. life, but was weakly 
detected in the cells of the villi from the 3rd day a.b., along the entire 
extension of the villi. On the 10th day, IAP was detected at the tip of the 
villi, while on the 25th day, it was detected along the extension of the villi, 
but with a weaker intensity. In conclusion, a temporal and spacial distribution 
of goblet cells and IAP activity occurs during the development of the small 
intestine, suggesting a possible regulatory control in accordance with the 
suckling and weaning phases of food intake in the rat's life.

Air pollution is considered to be one of the most important environmental health 
determinants. The studies constitute an attempt to explain the role of air 
pollutants in the impact on the length of life of the 3.5 million people living 
in the cities of the Silesia province in Poland. The association between the 
long-term inhalation exposure to PM10, benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium and lead in the 
period from 1989 to 2008 and length of life in the year 2014 of the inhabitants 
of 19 cities of the Silesia province has been estimated. The Pearson linear 
regression method was applied to calculate the relation between exposure to 
specific pollutants and length of life. In order to determine the influence of 
the mixture of the pollutants the multiple regression analysis was carried out. 
The studies have confirmed the significant correlations between the chronic 
exposure of Silesia province residents to PM10 and benzo(a)pyrene and their 
length of life. The stronger correlation was demonstrated in case of the 
long-term exposure to the mixture of examined air pollutants. Differentiated 
exposure of the inhabitants of the Silesia province to air pollutants results in 
existing inequalities in the life expectancy of men and women among the cities.

It has been observed by in vivo imaging that damaged neuronal structures can be 
reversibly restored after ischemic insults with the application of timely 
therapeutic interventions. However, what degree of neuronal damage can be 
restored and the time frame for reversible recovery of neuronal structures 
remain unclear. Here, transcranial two-photon imaging, histological staining and 
electron microscopy were used to investigate the reversible recovery of neuronal 
structures from dendrites to soma after different durations of global cerebral 
ischemia in mice. Intravital imaging revealed that the damage to dendritic 
structures was reversible when ischemia time was <1h, but they became difficult 
to restore after >3h of ischemia. Data from fixed YFP brain slice and Golgi 
staining indicated that the damage of dendritic structures progressively 
extended to deeper dendritic shafts with the extension of ischemia time. 
Furthermore, longer duration of ischemia caused an increasing number of 
degenerating neurons. Importantly, significant chromatin margination and 
karyopyknosis of neuron were observed after 6h of ischemia. These data suggested 
that neuronal structures could be reversibly restored when ischemia time was 
<1h, but irreversible and progressive damage to neurons occurred with longer 
duration of ischemia. Consistently, behavioral performance of post-ischemic 
animals experienced an ischemia time-dependent recovery. Taken together, our 
data suggested that recovery of neuronal structures following ischemia was 
dependent on the duration of ischemia, and prevention of neuronal loss is a key 
target for therapeutic interventions in ischemic stroke.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase in minority and 
underserved patients, who are also more likely to have poorer control of 
diabetes and related risk factors for complications. Although the Look AHEAD 
trial has demonstrated improved risk factor control among overweight or obese 
diabetes patients who received an intensive lifestyle intervention, translating 
such findings into accessible programs is a major public health challenge. The 
purpose of this paper is to report the design and baseline characteristics of 
the Lifestyle Interventions for the Treatment of Diabetes study (LIFT Diabetes). 
The overall goal is to test the impact of a community-based lifestyle weight 
loss (LWL) intervention adapted from Look AHEAD on cardiovascular disease risk 
at 12-months and 24-months among minority and lower income diabetes patients. 
Secondary outcomes include body weight, physical activity, medication use, cost, 
resource utilization, and safety. The primary hypothesis being tested is that 
the LWL will result in 10% relative reduction in CVD risk compared to the DSM. 
We have randomized 260 overweight or obese adults with diabetes one of two 
12-month interventions: a LWL condition delivered by community health workers or 
a diabetes self-management (DSM) education condition. The baseline demographic 
characteristics indicate that our sample is predominantly female, obese, low 
income, and ethnic minority. Translating evidence-based, lifestyle strategies, 
and targeting minority and underserved patients, will yield, if successful, a 
model for addressing the burden of diabetes and may favorably impact health 
disparities.
