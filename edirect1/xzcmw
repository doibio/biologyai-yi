BACKGROUND: Metastasis of rectal cancer to the penis is a very rare condition 
with less than 40 cases found in the literature.
CASE REPORT: We here report a case of a 41-year-old man who was diagnosed with 
rectal cancer which later metastasized to the penis. The patient was treated 
with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, underwent rectal resection, had adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and, despite that, had penile metastasis 2 years later. Palliative 
penectomy as well as bilateral orchiectomy with suprapubic cystostomy were 
performed. The patient died 2 months after the diagnosis. All the previous cases 
mentioned in the literature are reviewed as well.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of penile metastasis from rectal cancer is poor and 
life expectancy is short. The mechanism of rectal cancer metastasis spread to 
the penis is unknown. The most acceptable theory is retrograde venous spread. 
There are several treatment options; however, no single treatment option is 
associated with superior results.

PURPOSE: Improved life expectancy imposes new challenges for policy-makers. The 
growing oldest-old age group (defined as 80 and over) is often characterised by 
increased support needs. Greater attention to wellbeing in this population group 
is necessary, and may well require a shift in social policy focus. The current 
review seeks to explore current research on determinants of mental wellbeing for 
the oldest old.
METHODS: An iterative rapid review approach was used to review existing 
literature in line with four dimensions of mental wellbeing defined by the 
European Welfare Models and Mental Wellbeing in Final Years of Life (EMMY) 
study; functional, social, personal and environmental. A specific focus on 
articles employing multidimensional definitions of mental wellbeing was adopted.
RESULTS: Multidimensional indicators reflect the multifaceted and 
multidirectional dynamics of wellbeing in very old age. Considerable variety in 
both measures and terminology was found within the literature making precise 
comparison difficult. The current review takes steps towards comparability by 
focusing on studies implementing multiple measures of mental wellbeing including 
evaluative, hedonistic and eudaimonic factors. Clearly defined and multifaceted 
measures of mental wellbeing are needed to sharpen evidence used in policy 
development, appraisal and evaluation in light of the considerable diversity of 
health and functional states experienced in later life.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies appear to line up the four main dimensions of 
mental wellbeing identified in the EMMY study. Actively improving opportunities 
for older adults to produce benefits to society can be done via a stronger focus 
on resources such as mental wellbeing.

Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos State, Nigeria.

There is a need for relevant, valid, and practical metrics to better quantify 
both need and progress in global pediatric surgery and for monitoring systems 
performance. There are several existing surgical metrics in use, including 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), surgical backlog, effective coverage, 
cost-effectiveness, and the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery indicators. Most 
of these have, however, not been yet applied to children's surgery, leaving 
therefore significant data gaps in the burden of disease, infrastructure, human 
resources, and quality of care assessments in the specialty. This chapter 
reviews existing global surgical metrics, identifies settings where these have 
been already applied to children's surgery, and highlights opportunities for 
further inquiry in filling the knowledge gaps. Directing focused, intentional 
knowledge translation efforts in the identified areas of deficiency will foster 
the maturation of global pediatric surgery into a solid academic discipline able 
to contribute directly to the cause of improving the lives of children around 
the world.

INTRODUCTION: Proteomic profiling of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
could lead to improved risk prediction and novel insights into cardiovascular 
disease mechanisms. Plasma levels of 92 cardiovascular disease-associated 
proteins were assessed by proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD-1, 
Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) in a discovery cohort of dialysis patients, 
the Mapping of Inflammatory Markers in Chronic Kidney disease cohort [MIMICK; 
n = 183, 55% women, mean age 63 years, 46 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up 
(mean 43 months)]. Significant results were replicated in the incident and 
prevalent hemodialysis arm of the Salford Kidney Study [SKS dialysis study, 
n = 186, 73% women, mean age 62 years, 45 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up 
(mean 12 months)], and in the CKD5-LD-RTxcohort with assessments of coronary 
artery calcium (CAC)-score by cardiac computed tomography (n = 89, 37% women, 
mean age 46 years).
RESULTS: In age and sex-adjusted Cox regression in MIMICK, 11 plasma proteins 
were nominally associated with cardiovascular mortality (in order of 
significance: Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), Matrix metalloproteinase-7, 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor 2, Interleukin-6, Matrix metalloproteinase-1, 
Brain-natriuretic peptide, ST2 protein, Hepatocyte growth factor, TNF-related 
apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-2, Spondin-1, and Fibroblast growth factor 
25). Only plasma KIM-1 was associated with cardiovascular mortality after 
correction for multiple testing, but also after adjustment for dialysis vintage, 
cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation (hazard ratio) per standard 
deviation (SD) increase 1.84, 95% CI 1.26-2.69, p = 0.002. Addition of KIM-1, or 
nine of the most informative proteins to an established risk-score (modified 
AROii CVM-score) improved discrimination of cardiovascular mortality risk from 
C = 0.777 to C = 0.799 and C = 0.823, respectively. In the SKS dialysis study, 
KIM-1 predicted cardiovascular mortality in age and sex adjusted models (hazard 
ratio per SD increase 1.45, 95% CI 1.03-2.05, p = 0.034) and higher KIM-1 was 
associated with higher CACscores in the CKD5-LD-RTx-cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomics approach identified plasma KIM-1 as a risk marker 
for cardiovascular mortality and coronary artery calcification in three 
independent ESRD-cohorts. The improved risk prediction for cardiovascular 
mortality by plasma proteomics merit further studies.

Accurately measuring health state utilities is crucial for health economic 
evaluation. This study empirically investigated both indirect approaches 
(including using the latest version of five-level EQ-5D questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L 
and the popular SF-6D), as well as a direct approach (the time trade-off, TTO) 
for eliciting utilities in breast cancer patients. A valid sample of 608 breast 
cancer patients (48% TNM Stages III/IV) in mainland China was analysed. Mean 
utilities elicited from the TTO, EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D were 0.80, 0.83 and 0.65 
respectively. There is poor to fair agreement between direct and indirect 
approaches on measuring health state utilities with breast cancer patients. The 
absolute agreement was higher between EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D utilities (intraclass 
correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.55) than between TTO and EQ-5D-5L/SF-6D 
utilities (ICCs < 0.3). Regression analyses found that both EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D 
utilities were responsive to five out of eight breast cancer-specific symptom 
and functional scales. In sum, criterion and known-group validities of three 
health state utility measures which were investigated in this research suggest 
that, the EQ-5D-5L is currently the optimal approach (followed by the SF-6D) to 
elicit health state utilities from breast cancer patients in mainland China.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy has led to indications for spine surgery 
in patients older than 90 years, but data on associated risks and outcome are 
lacking.
METHODS: Indication, type of surgery, complications, functional outcome, and 
mortality were retrospectively collected from all patients aged 90 years or 
older operated between 2006 and 2016 at the University Hospital Basel, 
Switzerland.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included, of which 55% had degenerative, 36% 
traumatic, and 9% other pathologies. Most surgeries (84%) were performed 
electively and 16% as emergencies. More than a third (36%) of elective and 58% 
of emergency surgeries required stabilization. The complication rate was 54% in 
the elective surgery group (ELSG) and 125% in the emergency surgery group 
(EMSG). Stabilization (P = 0.006) and emergency surgeries (P = 0.032) were 
significant risk factors for experiencing complications. Six weeks after 
surgery, 80% of the patients reported symptomatic improvement. More than half 
(58%) of the patients in the ELSG reached their specific median life expectancy, 
compared with 38% in the EMSG. Seventeen percent of patients in the EMSG versus 
0% in the ELSG died in the first 3 months after surgery. In the nonstabilized 
group, 67% of the patients reached their median life expectancy, compared with 
38% of the stabilized group.
CONCLUSIONS: Elective spinal surgery in patients older than 90 years of age does 
not reduce life expectancy and has a good functional outcome for well-selected 
patients, whereas emergency surgery and stabilization surgery in this age group 
are associated with a high rate of complications and higher mortality.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determinate the cost-effectiveness 
of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) versus transfemoral stenting (TFS) and 
transcervical stenting (TCS) in a short- and long-term basis in symptomatic and 
asymptomatic patients.
METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2014, patients from the vascular 
department, with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, who were 
clinically and anatomically suitable for TFS, TCS, or CEA, were included. 
Prospective cost data for each individual procedure and complication during 
follow-up were obtained from the diagnosis-related group. The quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. 
Analysis of data was by treatment received. All statistical tests were 
two-sided. The significance level was 5%.
RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were enrolled: 61 for CEA (17.5%), 159 for TFS 
(45.5%), and 129 for TCS (37%). A total of 220 (63%) patients were symptomatic 
and 129 (37%) were asymptomatic. The median procedural cost and overall cost 
were lower on CEA (5499€ and 5595€, respectively). However, QALYs, for 
symptomatic patients, were better on TCS (7.3), whereas for asymptomatic 
patients, QALYs were better on CEA (9.6). Cost-effectiveness for symptomatic 
patients was better with TCS (803€/QALY), and for asymptomatic patients, it was 
with CEA (654€/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: TFS and TCS were associated with clinical outcomes equivalent to 
CEA on both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Cost-effectiveness ratios for 
symptomatic patients were better on TCS, whereas the CEA showed the best results 
in asymptomatic patients.

Several components of the GH axis are involved in tumor progression, and 
GH-induced intracellular signaling has been strongly associated with breast 
cancer susceptibility in genome-wide association studies. In the general 
population, high IGF-I levels and low IGF-binding protein-3 levels within the 
normal range are associated with the development of common malignancies, and 
components of the GH-IGF signaling system exhibit correlations with clinical, 
histopathological, and therapeutic parameters in cancer patients. Despite 
promising findings in preclinical studies, anticancer therapies targeting the 
GH-IGF signaling system have led to disappointing results in clinical trials. 
There is substantial evidence for some degree of protection against tumor 
development in several animal models and in patients with genetic defects 
associated with GH deficiency or resistance. In contrast, the link between GH 
excess and cancer risk in acromegaly patients is much less clear, and cancer 
screening in acromegaly has been a highly controversial issue. Recent studies 
have shown that increased life expectancy in acromegaly patients who attain 
normal GH and IGF-I levels is associated with more deaths due to age-related 
cancers. Replacement GH therapy in GH deficiency hypopituitary adults and short 
children has been shown to be safe when no other risk factors for malignancy are 
present. Nevertheless, the use of GH in cancer survivors and in short children 
with RASopathies, chromosomal breakage syndromes, or DNA-repair disorders should 
be carefully evaluated owing to an increased risk of recurrence, primary cancer, 
or second neoplasia in these individuals.

INTRODUCTION: During the last years, a significant number economic evaluations 
of HPV vaccination has been published. Given that cost-effectiveness constitutes 
an essential part of decision-making with regards to the reimbursement of a 
health technology, the purpose of this study is to provide a supportive tool to 
decision-makers regarding the economic efficiency of the introduction of HPV 
vaccination to national immunization programs.
AREAS COVERED: The PubMed database was searched in order to identify 
cost-effectiveness studies for HPV vaccination. A total of 42 articles were 
finally retrieved. All retrieved cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
converted in the same currency unit (I$) and then inflated to the same year 
(2015) in order to facilitate cross-country comparisons.
RESULTS: Overall, vaccination against HPV 6,11,16,18 types appears to have a 
ICER with mean value of I$25132/QALY, whereas the mean ICER of vaccination 
against oncogenic HPV 16,18 types is estimated at I$38,253/QALY.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: HPV vaccination would be a cost-effective intervention in the 
setting of high-income countries and could reduce the incidence of HPV-related 
diseases.

Recently, drugs targeting the remodelling, vascular circulation and homeostasis 
of bone are frequently applied with an unquestionable benefit in the therapy of 
numerous severe medical conditions. Besides bisphosphonates, other 
antiresorptive and antiangiogenic drugs are also used, however, limited 
publications are focusing on data of their results. Increasing number of 
patients arrives the mentioned medication is increasing in the daily dental 
practice, especially when accurate anamnesis is taken. Our aim is to highlight 
the preventive considerations that help minimize the occurence of 
medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw by presentating a complex dental 
rehabilitation of a patient at risk. The synchronization of dental surgery, 
conservative and prosthodontic treatment is essential in the case of an elderly 
patient having many concomitant disorders. Our aim is also to draw the attention 
of our colleagues working on different medical fields to the timing of dental 
procedures. The best and simplest way to prevent jaw necrosis is to achieve good 
oral health and hygiene before the introduction of antiresorptive therapy. If, 
however, our patient is already taking this medication, we still have a chance 
to prevent the appearance of this devastating condition by following the 
preventive measures. The medication-related necrosis of the jaw is a severe 
condition leading to a decreased life quality and having a reduced healing 
expectancy. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(48): 2031-2036.

valószínűsége. A szájsebészeti, konzerváló fogászati és protetikai ellátás 
szinkronizálása kitüntetett szereppel bír egy idős, sok háttérbetegséggel 
rendelkező páciens esetén. Célunk továbbá felhívni a társszakmákban dolgozó 
kollégák figyelmét a beavatkozások időzítésének jelentőségére. Az 
állcsontnecrosis megelőzésének alapja a gyógyszerszedés előtti teljes körű 
fogászati szanálás. Amennyiben azonban a páciens már szedi a csontmetabolizmusra 
ható és mucotoxicus készítményt, megfelelő felkészültség és gondosság mellett 
lehet esély a súlyos, az életminőséget komolyan befolyásoló és rossz gyógyulási 
hajlamot mutató szövődmények megelőzésére. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(48): 2031–2036.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an asymptomatic disease associated with high 
morbidity and life-threatening complications that lead to decreased life 
expectancy. Worldwide prevalence of CKD is escalating at an alarming rate. Large 
population-based representative surveys have been reported in Western countries 
to estimate the prevalence of the disease. However, there is paucity of data as 
far as developing nations are concerned. Asia is the world's largest continent 
accommodating maximum number of under-developed and developing countries with an 
unclear picture of prevalence of CKD. Current review attempts to give an insight 
to the prevalence of CKD in this region by combining population-based surveys. 
This review will assist in estimating the burden of CKD in Asia, so that 
appropriate control measures could be designed.

The unprecedented increase of life expectancy challenges society to protect the 
elderly from morbidity and mortality making vaccination a crucial mean to 
safeguard this population. Indeed, infectious diseases, such as influenza and 
pneumonia, are among the top killers of elderly people in the world. Elderly 
individuals are more prone to severe infections and less responsive to 
vaccination prevention, due to immunosenescence combined with the progressive 
increase of a proinflammatory status characteristic of the aging process 
(inflammaging). These factors are responsible for most age-related diseases and 
correlate with poor response to vaccination. Therefore, it is of utmost interest 
to deepen the knowledge regarding the role of inflammaging in vaccination 
responsiveness to support the development of effective vaccination strategies 
designed for elderly. In this review we analyse the impact of age-associated 
factors such as inflammaging, immunosenescence and immunobiography on immune 
response to vaccination in the elderly, and we consider systems biology 
approaches as a mean for integrating a multitude of data in order to rationally 
design vaccination approaches specifically tailored for the elderly.

OBJECTIVE: To support decision-making in aortic valve replacement (AVR) in 
elderly patients, we provide a comprehensive overview of outcome after AVR with 
bioprostheses.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies reporting clinical outcome 
after AVR with bioprostheses in elderly patients (mean age ≥70 years; minimum 
age ≥65 years) published between January 1, 2000, to September 1, 2016. Reported 
event rates and time-to-event data were pooled and entered into a 
microsimulation model to calculate life expectancy and lifetime event risks.
RESULTS: Forty-two studies reporting on 34 patient cohorts were included, 
encompassing a total of 12,842 patients with 55,437 patient-years of follow-up 
(pooled mean follow-up 5.0 ± 3.3 years). Pooled mean age was 76.5 ± 5.5 years. 
Pooled early mortality risk was 5.42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.49-6.55), 
thromboembolism rate was 1.83%/year (95% CI, 1.28-3.61), and bleeding rate was 
0.75%/year (95% CI, 0.50-1.11). Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was based 
on pooled time to SVD data (Gompertz; shape: 0.124, rate: 0.003). For a 
75-year-old patient, this translated to an estimated life expectancy of 
9.8 years (general population: 10.2 years) and lifetime risks of bleeding of 7%, 
thromboembolism of 17%, and reintervention of 9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The low risks of SVD and reintervention support the use of 
bioprostheses in elderly patients in need of AVR. The estimated life expectancy 
after AVR was comparable with the general population. The results of this study 
inform patients and clinicians about the expected outcomes after bioprosthetic 
AVR and thereby support treatment decision-making. Furthermore, our results can 
be used as a benchmark for long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation in patients who were eligible for surgery and other (future) 
alternative treatments (eg, tissue-engineered heart valves).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the 
association of hormonal contraception and other life-style factors and habits 
affecting body composition (BC) and muscle strength.
STUDY DESIGN: We measured the body composition of 400 healthy Finnish women 
(aged 20-40 years) using total body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (TB-DXA) as 
well as grip strength (GS [kPa]) with a hand-held dynamometer and knee extension 
strength (KES [kg]) between 2011 and 2014. Investigated body composition 
variables were appendicular skeletal mass (ASM [kg]), body mass index (BMI 
[kg/m2]), relative skeletal muscle index (RSMI [ASM/m2]), total lean mass (TLM 
[kg]), skeletal muscle index (SMI [TLM/weight × 100]) and fat-%. Participants 
filled out a questionnaire concerning life-style factors and habits: hormonal 
contraception, physical activity, alcohol consumption, age, pregnancies, smoking 
and self-assessed health that were also adjusting factors in the covariate 
model. We investigated the effects of hormonal contraception and other 
life-style factors and habits on body composition and muscle strength using 
AN(C)OVA in the analyses.
RESULTS: Women using hormonal contraception with the combination of ethinyl 
estradiol + progestogen had significantly lower mean ASM (18.0), RSMI (6.5), TLM 
(40.8) (p < 0.01) and GS (34.6) (p < 0.001) compared to the women not using 
hormonal contraception with mean values of ASM (18.8), RSMI (6.7), TLM (42.6) 
and GS (36.9). After adjustment ASM (18.3), SMI (64.3), GS (35.2) (p < 0.05), 
RSMI (6.6) and TLM (41.2) (p < 0.01) were significantly lower and fat-% (31.4) 
higher (p < 0.05) compared to women not using hormonal contraception with mean 
values of ASM (19.0), SMI (66.1), GS (36.7), RSMI (6.8), TLM (42.7) and fat-% 
(29.8).
CONCLUSION: Use of ethinyl estradiol + progestogen-containing hormonal 
contraception may have negative association with muscle mass and strength.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the significant impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
there is not yet an analytical decision tool for assessing efficiency of 
interventions to prevent primary CVD events in Brazil. Therefore, we sought to 
adapt a Scottish CVD Policy Model to be used in the proposed population.
METHODS: Calibration consisted of identifying multiplicative factors for linear 
predictors of existing survival analysis models to produce predictions that 
closely match observed data (Life-table and Brazilian cohort study). Target data 
were life expectancy (LE) and cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease 
(CHD), cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), fatal CVD and fatal non-CVD. 
Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) was used to estimate differences between 
predictions and observations. Acceptance criteria were defined as a fit of less 
than one year for LE and 1% for cumulative incidence. Male and female models 
were built separately.
RESULTS: The original model underestimated LE (RMSE=2.85 for men and 1.91 for 
women), CHD and CBVD for women (RMSE=0.044 and 0.041, respectively). The 
calibration process identified multiplicative factors to reach acceptance 
criteria for the four target data mentioned above (RMSE=0.61, 0.21, 0.016 and 
0.017, respectively). Over prediction was identified only for CHD events in men 
(RMSE=0.031) being further calibrated (RMSE=0.008). All other target data met 
the acceptance criteria. Overall, the calibrated model predicts properly to 
individuals aging 35-80 years old, diabetics or not, smokers or not, with or 
without family history of CVD, and presenting at least one of the risk factors 
uncontrolled: Systolic Blood Pressure, Total Cholesterol or HDL-Cholesterol.
DISCUSSION: This is the first decision analytic model capable of assessing 
efficiency of interventions that prevent primary CVD events in Brazil. In future 
research, independent external validation should be carried out to corroborate 
the reliability of the model outputs.

BACKGROUND: A recent cluster randomized trial evaluating a multicomponent 
intervention showed significant reductions in blood pressure in low-income 
hypertensive subjects in Argentina.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
METHODS: A total of 1432 hypertensive participants were recruited from 18 
primary health care centers. The intervention included home visits led by 
community health workers, physician education, and text messaging. Resource use 
and quality of life data using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional 
questionnaire were prospectively collected. The study perspective was that of 
the public health care system, and the time horizon was 18 months. 
Intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze cost and health outcomes 
(systolic blood pressure [SBP] change and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). 
A 1 time gross domestic product per capita per QALY was used as the 
cost-effectiveness threshold (US $14,062).
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two arms. QALYs 
significantly increased by 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.09) in the 
intervention group, and SBP net difference favored the intervention group: 5.3 
mm Hg (95% CI 0.27-10.34). Mean total costs per participant were higher in the 
intervention arm: US $304 in the intervention group and US $154 in the control 
group (adjusted difference of US $140.18; 95% CI US $75.41-US $204.94). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3299 per QALY (95% credible interval 
1635-6099) and US $26 per mm Hg of SBP (95% credible interval 13-46). Subgroup 
analysis showed that the intervention was cost-effective in all prespecified 
subgroups (age, sex, cardiovascular risk, and body mass index).
CONCLUSIONS: The multicomponent intervention was cost-effective for blood 
pressure control among low-income hypertensive patients.

BACKGROUND: Warfarin use for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) 
patients with chronic kidney disease is debated. Apixaban was shown to be safer 
than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, 
mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in 
AF patients at different levels of kidney function.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban 
compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 
ml/min, and 50 ml/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were 
obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system 
perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and 
Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. 
Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the 
robustness of results.
RESULTS: Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy compared with warfarin in AF 
patients with eGFR levels of 50 ml/min or less and 50 to 80 ml/min. In patients 
with an eGFR of more than 80 ml/min, apixaban was cost-effective compared with 
warfarin, costing $6307 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were 
consistent assuming anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. 
Compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban was the only cost-effective 
anticoagulant strategy relative to warfarin in both mild and moderate renal 
impairment settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is a favorably cost-effective alternative to warfarin in 
AF patients with normal kidney function and potentially cost-saving in those 
with renal impairment.

BACKGROUND: Dual urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with lesinurad in combination with 
either allopurinol or febuxostat is an option for patients with gout 
unsuccessfully treated on either monotherapy. Treatment failure is often a 
result of poor medication adherence. Imperfect adherence in clinical trials may 
lead to biased estimates of treatment effect and confound the results of 
cost-effectiveness analyses.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of varying medication adherence on the cost 
effectiveness of lesinurad dual therapy and estimate the value-based price of 
lesinurad at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is equal to £20,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
METHODS: Treatment effect was simulated using published 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models and scenarios representing adherence in 
clinical trials, routine practice, and perfect use. The subsequent cost and 
health impacts, over the lifetime of a patient cohort, were estimated using a 
bespoke pharmacoeconomic model.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing lesinurad 
dual ULT with monotherapy ranged from £39,184 to £78,350/QALY gained using 
allopurinol and £31,901 to £124,212/QALY gained using febuxostat, depending on 
the assumed medication adherence. Results assuming perfect medication adherence 
imply a per-quarter value-based price of lesinurad of £45.14 when used in dual 
ULT compared with allopurinol alone and £57.75 compared with febuxostat alone, 
falling to £25.41 and £3.49, respectively, in simulations of worsening 
medication adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated value-based prices of lesinurad only exceeded that 
which has been proposed in the United Kingdom when assuming both perfect drug 
adherence and the eradication of gout flares in sustained treatment responders.

Adjusted Limited Dependent Variable Mixture Models versus Response Mapping.

BACKGROUND: Preference-based measures of health, such as the three-level EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), are required to calculate 
quality-adjusted life-years for use in cost-effectiveness analysis, but are 
often not recorded in clinical studies. In these cases, mapping can be used to 
estimate preference-based measures.
OBJECTIVES: To model the relationship between the EQ-5D-3L and the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer (FACT-B) instrument, comparing 
indirect and direct mapping methods, and the use of FACT-B summary score versus 
FACT-B subscale scores.
METHODS: We used data from three clinical studies for advanced breast cancer 
providing 11,958 observations with full information on FACT-B and the EQ-5D-3L. 
We compared direct mapping using adjusted limited dependent variable mixture 
models (ALDVMMs) with indirect mapping using seemingly unrelated ordered probit 
models. The EQ-5D-3L was estimated as a function of FACT-B and other 
patient-related covariates.
RESULTS: The use of FACT-B subscale scores was better than using the total 
FACT-B score. A good fit to the observed data was observed across the entire 
range of disease severity in all models. ALDVMMs outperformed the indirect 
mapping. The breast cancer-specific scale had a strong influence in predicting 
the pain/discomfort and self-care dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L.
CONCLUSIONS: This article adds to the growing literature that demonstrates the 
performance of the ALDVMM method for mapping. Regardless of which model is used, 
the subscales of FACT-B should be included as independent variables wherever 
possible. The breast cancer-specific subscale of FACT-B is important in 
predicting the EQ-5D-3L. This suggests that generic cancer measures should not 
be used for utility mapping in patients with breast cancer.
