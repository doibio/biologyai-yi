regarding the age criteria for choosing biological valves, or if the age should 
be set higher relative to that specified in the western guidelines, given the 
longer Japanese life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: We believe that the development of unique, Japanese guidelines for 
the selection of prosthetic valves will allow us to provide appropriate 
selection and treatment for each patient.

The rate of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is rising rapidly, 
despite limited evidence about the procedure's relative benefits and harms. The 
objective of this study is to examine the impact of CPM on life expectancy (LE) 
and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in women with sporadic unilateral 
breast cancer. A Markov model was developed to compare 18 hypothetical cohorts 
of 45-year-old women with newly diagnosed unilateral, sporadic breast cancer 
treated with or without CPM. The probability of developing distant metastases by 
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and molecular subtype was derived from 
British Columbia Cancer Agency data. Additional model parameters were identified 
from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the 
impact of plausible variations in key model parameters on results. CPM improved 
LE in all cohorts (range 0.06-0.54 years). Stage had more effect on LE than 
subtype (stage I mean, 0.44 years, stage III mean, 0.11 years). However, after 
adjusting for quality-of-life, No CPM was favored in all cohorts. Univariate 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most influential model parameter was 
the post-CPM health state utility. The preferred strategy shifted from No CPM to 
CPM when the post-CPM utility exceeded 0.83 (base case value 0.81). PSA 
indicated that LE gains and QALE decreases were stable in all cohorts. The 
primary determinant of survival after unilateral breast cancer is stage at 
diagnosis. Our results suggest that routine CPM would not improve 
quality-adjusted survival for the majority of women with unilateral sporadic 
breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important endpoint of 
many healthcare interventions. This study develops guidance on how to select 
appropriate HRQoL measures for inclusion in a clinical trial, given the purposes 
of the HRQoL measurement.
METHODS: The guidance is based on a systematic literature review, discussions 
with members of the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) 
and two rounds of public consultation.
RESULTS: A set of twelve recommendations was developed, addressing the 
requirements for HRQoL data for relative effectiveness assessment, for 
cost-utility analyses and for informing clinical decision making. 
Recommendations relate to the choice of the type of measure as well as to 
aspects such as measurement frequency, target population and presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The purpose and context of HRQoL measurement is crucial for the 
relevance of the data obtained with a specific HRQoL measure. It is recommended 
to always include a generic HRQoL instrument in clinical trials to cover a wide 
range of possible future uses of the HRQoL data.

During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence and extension movements elongate 
embryonic tissues anteroposteriorly and narrow them mediolaterally. Planar cell 
polarity (PCP) signaling is essential for mediolateral cell elongation 
underlying these movements, but how this polarity arises is poorly understood. 
We analyzed the elongation, orientation and migration behaviors of lateral 
mesodermal cells undergoing convergence and extension movements in wild-type 
zebrafish embryos and mutants for the Wnt/PCP core component Vangl2 (Trilobite). 
We demonstrate that Vangl2 function is required at the time when cells 
transition to a highly elongated and mediolaterally aligned body. vangl2 mutant 
cells fail to undergo this transition and to migrate along a straight path with 
high net speed towards the dorsal midline. Instead, vangl2 mutant cells exhibit 
an anterior/animal pole bias in cell body alignment and movement direction, 
suggesting that PCP signaling promotes effective dorsal migration in part by 
suppressing anterior/animalward cell polarity and movement. Endogenous Vangl2 
protein accumulates at the plasma membrane of mesenchymal converging cells at 
the time its function is required for mediolaterally polarized cell behavior. 
Heterochronic cell transplantations demonstrated that Vangl2 cell membrane 
accumulation is stage dependent and regulated by both intrinsic factors and an 
extracellular signal, which is distinct from PCP signaling or other gastrulation 
regulators, including BMP and Nodals. Moreover, mosaic expression of fusion 
proteins revealed enrichment of Vangl2 at the anterior cell edges of highly 
mediolaterally elongated cells. These results demonstrate that the dynamic 
Vangl2 intracellular distribution is coordinated with and necessary for the 
changes in convergence and extension cell behaviors during gastrulation.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic and economic benefits of continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) 
have been established in middle-aged people. In older people there is a lack of 
evidence.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical efficacy of CPAP in older people with OSAS 
and to establish its cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: A randomised, parallel, investigator-blinded multicentre trial with 
within-trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-eight patients, aged ≥ 65 years with newly 
diagnosed OSAS [defined as oxygen desaturation index at ≥ 4% desaturation 
threshold level for > 7.5 events/hour and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score 
of ≥ 9] recruited from 14 hospital-based sleep services across the UK.
INTERVENTIONS: CPAP with best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone. Autotitrating 
CPAP was initiated using standard clinical practice. BSC was structured advice 
on minimising sleepiness.
COPRIMARY OUTCOMES: Subjective sleepiness at 3 months, as measured by the ESS 
(ESS mean score: months 3 and 4) and cost-effectiveness over 12 months, as 
measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated using the European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and health-care resource use, information 
on which was collected monthly from patient diaries.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Subjective sleepiness at 12 months (ESS mean score: months 
10, 11 and 12) and objective sleepiness, disease-specific and generic quality of 
life, mood, functionality, nocturia, mobility, accidents, cognitive function, 
cardiovascular risk factors and events at 3 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-eight patients were randomised to CPAP 
(n = 140) or BSC (n = 138) over 27 months and 231 (83%) patients completed the 
trial. Baseline ESS score was similar in both groups [mean (standard deviation; 
SD) CPAP 11.5 (3.3), BSC 11.4 (4.2)]; groups were well balanced for other 
characteristics. The mean (SD) in ESS score at 3 months was -3.8 (0.4) in the 
CPAP group and -1.6 (0.3) in the BSC group. The adjusted treatment effect of 
CPAP compared with BSC was -2.1 points [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.0 to 
-1.3 points; p < 0.001]. At 12 months the effect was -2.0 points (95% CI -2.8 to 
-1.2 points; p < 0.001). The effect was greater in patients with increased CPAP 
use or higher baseline ESS score. The number of QALYs calculated using the EQ-5D 
was marginally (0.005) higher with CPAP than with BSC (95% CI -0.034 to 0.044). 
The average cost per patient was £1363 (95% CI £1121 to £1606) for those 
allocated to CPAP and £1389 (95% CI £1116 to £1662) for those allocated to BSC. 
On average, costs were lower in the CPAP group (mean -£35; 95% CI -£390 to 
£321). The probability that CPAP was cost-effective at thresholds conventionally 
used by the NHS (£20,000 per QALY gained) was 0.61. QALYs calculated using the 
Short Form questionnaire-6 Dimensions were 0.018 higher in the CPAP group (95% 
CI 0.003 to 0.034 QALYs) and the probability that CPAP was cost-effective was 
0.96. CPAP decreased objective sleepiness (p = 0.02), increased mobility 
(p = 0.03) and reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05, 
p = 0.04, respectively) at 3 months but not at 12 months. In the BSC group, 
there was a fall in systolic blood pressure of 3.7 mmHg at 12 months, which was 
not seen in the CPAP group (p = 0.04). Mood, functionality, nocturia, accidents, 
cognitive function and cardiovascular events were unchanged. There were no 
medically significant harms attributable to CPAP.
CONCLUSION: In older people with OSAS, CPAP reduces sleepiness and is marginally 
more cost-effective than BSC over 12 months. Further work is required in the 
identification of potential biomarkers of sleepiness and those patients at 
increased risk of cognitive impairment. Early detection of which could be used 
to inform the clinician when in the disease cycle treatment is needed to avert 
central nervous system sequelae and to assist patients decision-making regarding 
treatment and compliance. Treatment adherence is also a challenge in clinical 
trials generally, and adherence to CPAP therapy in particular is a recognised 
concern in both research studies and clinical practice. Suggested research 
priorities would include a focus on optimisation of CPAP delivery or support and 
embracing the technological advances currently available. Finally, the 
improvements in quality of life in trials do not appear to reflect the dramatic 
changes noted in clinical practice. There should be a greater focus on patient 
centred outcomes which would better capture the symptomatic improvement with 
CPAP treatment and translate these improvements into outcomes which could be 
used in health economic analysis.

Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) are defined as infections developing in 
relation to health services at inpatient treatment facilities in general. 
Although health services improve, HAIs continue to be seen both in 
underdeveloped and developed countries. HAIs result in a range of negative 
externalities. Negative externalities include factors such as an increase in 
morbidity and mortality, extension of the hospitalization duration, impaired 
quality of life, loss of working power and performance. HAIs pose a big burden 
regarding population and community health care. This study aims to calculate the 
financial burden of HAIs by evaluating it within the scope of negative 
externality. The communal costs of HAIs patients were calculated by using a 
genuine approach with reference to samples obtained from the Duzce University 
Research and Application Hospital. This approach includes 4 stages and the 
results of each stage is sorted according to the data of 2013 as follows: (i) 
HAIs expenditure undertaken by the Social Security Institution is 5,832,167 TL, 
(ii) the monetary value of the work power loss of the HAIs patients who are at a 
working age is 126,154 TL, (iii) the relative cost of HAIs patients compared to 
a group of normal patients is 21,507 TL and (iv) HAIs patients' communal cost is 
6,013,101 TL. Based on the received results, the annual communal cost of the 
estimated HAIs patients in Turkey is predicted to be 3,640,442,057 TL. In 
addition to these findings, HAIs patients experience 14 times longer in-patient 
stay at the hospitals as compared to normal patients, and their treatment 
expenditures are 23 times higher than the normal patients. In the conclusion 
part of the study, regarding the preventability (internalization) of HAIs, which 
was evaluated as part of negative externality, alternative applicable political 
suggestions are presented for the use of policymakers.

[Geriatric risk detection and prevention in older elective surgery patients--a 
novel track in Assuta Medical Centers].

[Article in Hebrew]

Gindin J, Waserman D, Shlomo Y, Rafael Y.

As life expectancy rises, so do the rates of operable chronic and/or non-urgent 
conditions, and the prevalence of the elderly among elective surgery patients. 
Pre-operative assessments have so far been based on standards of internal and 
anaesthetic medicine, and focused on the physical aspect. This paper presents a 
groundbreaking modified assessment for detecting geriatric risks and selecting 
appropriate interventions.
AIMS: An appropriate response to the unique risks and needs of elderly patients 
in elective surgery, emphasizing each individual's functional, mental, emotional 
and environmental-supportive aspects, alongside the physical aspects typical of 
old age.
METHODS: In addition to anaesthetic pre-operative assessment, patients aged 75 
and older underwent a geriatric screening assessment, identifying those who 
require in-depth geriatric assessment. This algorithmically triggers persons at 
selected risks for treatment and intervention. This paper describes the method 
and its principles, and characterizes patient groups and problems.
RESULTS: A total of 18.6% of screened patients showed risks or problems 
requiring in-depth assessment and intervention. An average of 5.9 treatment and 
intervention protocols were triggered and activated per in-depth assessee.
CONCLUSIONS: The pre-operative geriatric assessment was welcomed by doctors and 
nurses and by management, as well as patients' families. The success in the 
preliminary screening and secondary activation of geriatric protocols for 
elective surgery is expressed in the doubting of proactive calls from surgery 
wards for the Geriatric team during the first 6 months of service 
implementation.
SUMMARY: The screening of elderly patients above 70 years of age in elective 
surgery focuses resources on only one fifth of them, who are at geriatric risk. 
Providing solutions for the individual, the system, the family and the 
post-discharge services, improves care during hospitalization and afterwards.

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) is defined as the presence of a clonal B-cell 
population in the peripheral blood with fewer than 5 × 10(9)/L B-cells and no 
other signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The majority of cases of MBL have 
the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MBL can be 
categorized as either low count or high count based on whether the B-cell count 
is above or below 0.5 × 10(9)/L. Low-count MBL can be detected in ∼5% of adults 
over the age of 40 years when assessed using standard-sensitivity flow cytometry 
assays. A number of biological and genetic characteristics distinguish low-count 
from high-count MBL. Whereas low-count MBL rarely progresses to CLL, high-count 
MBL progresses to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1% to 2% per year. 
High-count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the B-cell count 
is above or below 5 × 10(9)/L. Although individuals with both high-count MBL and 
CLL Rai stage 0 are at increased risk of infections and second cancers, the risk 
of progression requiring treatment and the potential to shorten life expectancy 
are greater for CLL. This review highlights challenging questions regarding the 
classification, risk stratification, management, and supportive care of patients 
with MBL and CLL.

Research on in vitro spermatogenesis is important for elucidating the 
spermatogenic mechanism. We previously developed an organ culture method which 
can support spermatogenesis from spermatogonial stem cells up to sperm formation 
using immature mouse testis tissues. In this study, we examined whether it is 
also applicable to mature testis tissues of adult mice. We used two lines of 
transgenic mice, Acrosin-GFP and Gsg2-GFP, which carry the marker GFP gene 
specific for meiotic and haploid cells, respectively. Testis tissue fragments of 
adult GFP mice, aged from 4 to 29 weeks old, which express GFP at full 
extension, were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% KSR or AlbuMAX. GFP 
expression decreased rapidly and became the lowest at 7 to 14 days of culture, 
but then slightly increased during the following culture period. This increase 
reflected de novo spermatogenesis, confirmed by BrdU labeling in spermatocytes 
and spermatids. We also used vitamin A-deficient mice, whose testes contain only 
spermatogonia. The testes of those mice at 13-21 weeks old, showing no GFP 
expression at explantation, gained GFP expression during culturing, and 
spermatogenesis was confirmed histologically. In addition, the adult testis 
tissues of Sl/Sld mutant mice, which lack spermatogenesis due to Kit ligand 
mutation, were cultured with recombinant Kit ligand to induce spermatogenesis up 
to haploid formation. Although the efficiency of spermatogenesis was lower than 
that of pup, present results showed that the organ culture method is effective 
for the culturing of mature adult mouse testis tissue, demonstrated by the 
induction of spermatogenesis from spermatogonia to haploid cells.

Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

BACKGROUND: Estimations of life expectancies (LE) in health and ill health are 
important for planning future health care support. This study aimed at 
quantifying whether an increased LE is accompanied by an increase in the 
duration of life with dementia (DemLE) in Hong Kong SAR.
METHODS: Two parameters from a logistic model were used to fit the overall trend 
of the weighted prevalence of dementia. Abridged age- and sex-specific life 
tables and Sullivan's method were used to calculate dementia-free LE (DemFLE) 
for 1998 and 2013.
RESULTS: In 2013, among elderly individuals in Hong Kong aged 65 years, men had 
lived with dementia for 1.8 years and women for 3.6 years. These values are 
similar to those for subjects aged ≥85 years, while the proportion of DemLE was 
much greater at advanced ages. Elderly female individuals tend to experience a 
greater number of years with dementia than males.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate although LE has increased for all older age 
groups over time, the increase in DemFLE has not been greater than the gain in 
LE, suggesting an absolute expansion of the burden of dementia to the community 
between 1998 and 2013. The results suggest that more caregiving resources and 
manpower will be needed in the future as the population ages.

Dutch Cycling: Quantifying the Health and Related Economic Benefits.

Sensible Transport, Melbourne, Australia. Paul Schepers was also with the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.

The Netherlands is well known for their high bicycle use. We used the Health 
Economic Assessment Tool and life table calculations to quantify the 
population-level health benefits from Dutch cycling levels. Cycling prevents 
about 6500 deaths each year, and Dutch people have half-a-year-longer life 
expectancy because of cycling. These health benefits correspond to more than 3% 
of the Dutch gross domestic product. Our study confirmed that investments in 
bicycle-promoting policies (e.g., improved bicycle infrastructure and 
facilities) will likely yield a high cost-benefit ratio in the long term.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing international commitment to universal health 
coverage (UHC), but limited means to determine progress towards that goal. We 
developed a practical index for capturing health service coverage - a critical 
dimension of UHC -- that was more inclusive than previous methods.
METHODS: Our data included publicly-available, indicators reflecting health 
service delivery, infrastructure, human resources, and health expenditures for 
103 countries. We selected a set of internally-consistent indicators and 
performed principal component analysis. Multiple imputation was used to address 
missing values. We extracted and rotated four components related to health 
service coverage and developed a composite index for each country for 2009.
RESULTS: Explaining cumulatively almost 80% of the total variance, the four 
extracted components were characterized as: 1) provision of services, 2) 
infrastructure and human resources, 3) immunization (provision of services), and 
4) financial resources. The health service coverage index developed from these 
components demonstrated strong correlation with health outcome measures such as 
infant mortality and life expectancy, supporting its validity. Index values also 
appeared generally consistent with published reports and the regional 
distribution of health coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach moved beyond common indicators of service coverage 
focused on infectious diseases and maternal and child health, to include 
information on necessary health inputs. The resulting, balanced, composite index 
of health service coverage demonstrated promise as a metric, likely to 
discriminate coverage levels between countries and regions. An important number 
of service provision indicators were correlated, therefore a reduced set of 
services performed well as a proxy for the full set of available indicators. 
This parsimonious index is a start toward simplifying the task of policy-makers 
monitoring progress on a key domain of universal health coverage.

AIMS: To quantify the reduction potential of asthma in Finland achievable by 
adjusting exposures to selected environmental factors.
METHODS: A life table model for the Finnish population for 1986-2040 was 
developed and Years Lived with Disability caused by asthma and attributable to 
the following selected exposures were estimated: tobacco smoke (smoking and 
second hand tobacco smoke), ambient fine particles, indoor dampness and mould, 
and pets.
RESULTS: At baseline (2011) about 25% of the total asthma burden was 
attributable to the selected exposures. Banning tobacco was the most efficient 
mitigation action, leading to 6% reduction of the asthma burden. A 50% reduction 
in exposure to dampness and mould as well as a doubling in exposure to pets lead 
each to a 2% reduction. Ban of urban small scale wood combustion, chosen as a 
mitigation action to reduce exposure to fine particles, leads to a reduction of 
less than 1% of the total asthma burden. Combination of the most efficient 
mitigation actions reduces the total asthma burden by 10%. A more feasible 
combination of mitigation actions leads to 6% reduction of the asthma burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The adjustment of environmental exposures can reduce the asthma 
burden in Finland by up to 10%.

BACKGROUND: Despite the dramatically improved survival due to combination 
antiretroviral therapies (cART), life expectancy of people with HIV/AIDS remains 
lower than that of the general population. This study aimed to estimate, at a 
population level, the survival experience of Italian people with AIDS (PWA) and 
to quantify the prognostic role of selected factors at diagnosis in the risk of 
early mortality (i.e., within six months from AIDS diagnosis).
METHODS: A population-based, retrospective-cohort study was conducted among 
Italian PWA diagnosed between 1999 and 2009 and recorded in the national AIDS 
registry. The vital status, up to December 2010, of 14,552 PWA was ascertained 
through a record linkage procedure with the Italian mortality database. Survival 
probabilities were estimated through Kaplan-Meier method. To identify risk 
factors for early mortality from any cause, odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for major confounders, were computed 
using multivariate logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Of the 5,706 deaths registered among the 14,552 PWA included in the 
study, 2,757 (18.9%) occurred within six months from AIDS diagnosis. The 
probability of surviving six months increased from 81.2% in PWA diagnosed in 
1999-2000 to 82.9% in 2009, while the 5-year survival augmented from 60.7% in 
PWA diagnosed in 1999-2000 to 65.4% for PWA diagnosed in 2005-2006. Elevated 
risks of early mortality were associated to older age (OR = 5.28; 95% CI: 
4.41-6.32 for age ≥60 vs. <35 years), injecting drug use (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 
1.53-1.91 vs. heterosexual intercourse), and CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3) at AIDS 
diagnosis (OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.55-2.27 vs. ≥350). Elevated ORs for early 
mortality also emerged for PWA diagnosed with primary brain lymphoma 
(OR = 11.66, 95% CI: 7.32-18.57), or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(OR = 4.21, 95% CI: 3.37-5.27).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented, among Italian PWA, the high - though slightly 
decreasing - frequency of early mortality in the full cART era. These findings 
indicate the need for enduring and ameliorating preventive actions aimed at 
timely HIV testing among all individuals at risk for HIV infection and/or those 
who present diseases known to be related with HIV infection.

PURPOSE: In an otherwise healthy patient with severe facial disfigurement 
secondary to burns, composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) results in 
life-long immunosuppressive therapy and its associated risk. In this study, we 
assess the net gain of CTA of face (in terms of utilities) from the perspectives 
of patient, general public and medical expert, in comparison to the risks.
METHODS: Using the standard gamble (SG) and time-trade off (TTO) techniques, 
utilities were obtained from members of general public, patients with facial 
burns, and medical experts (n=25 for each group). The gain (or loss) in utility 
and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated using face-to-face 
interviews. A sensitivity analysis using variable life expectancy was conducted.
RESULTS: From the patient perspective, severe facial burn was associated with a 
health utility value of 0.53, and 27.1 QALYs as calculated by SG, and a health 
utility value of 0.57, and 28.9 QALYs as calculated by TTO. In comparison, CTA 
of the face was associated with a health utility value of 0.64, and 32.3 QALYs 
(or 18.2 QALYs years per sensitivity analysis) as calculated by SG, and a health 
utility value of 0.67, and 34.1 QALYs (or 19.2QALYs per sensitivity analysis) as 
calculated by TTO. However, a loss of 8.9 QALYs (by SG method) to 9.5 QALYs (by 
TTO method) was observed when the life expectancy was decreased in the 
sensitivity analysis. Similar results were obtained from the general population 
and medical experts perspectives.
CONCLUSION: We found that severe facial disfigurement is associated with a 
significant reduction in the health-related quality of life, and CTA has the 
potential to improve this. Further, we found that a trade-off exists between the 
life expectancy and gain in the QALYs, i.e. if life expectancy following CTA of 
face is reduced, the gain in QALY is also diminished. This trade-off needs to be 
validated in future studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of second HIV test in pregnancy.
BACKGROUND: Current strategy of single HIV test during pregnancy in India can 
miss new HIV infections acquired after the first test or those HIV infections 
that were missed in the first test due to a false-negative HIV test.
METHODS: Between August 2011 and April 2013, 9097 pregnant HIV uninfected women 
were offered a second HIV test near term (34 weeks or beyond) or within 4 weeks 
of postpartum period. A decision analysis model was used to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness of a second HIV test in pregnant women near term.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: Our key outcome measures include programme cost 
with addition of second HIV test in pregnant women and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: We detected 4 new HIV infections in the second test. Thus HIV incidence 
among pregnant women was 0.12 (95% 0.032 to 0.297) per 100 person women years 
(PWY). Current strategy of a single HIV test is 8.2 times costlier for less 
QALYs gained as compared to proposed repeat HIV testing of pregnant women who 
test negative during the first test.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results warrant consideration at the national level for 
including a second HIV test of all pregnant women in the national programme. 
However prior to allocation of resources for a second HIV test in pregnancy, 
appropriate strategies will have to be planned for improving compliance for 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and reducing loss-to-follow-up 
of those women detected with HIV.

PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of blindness and cataract surgical outcomes 
in persons 50 years or older above in Takeo Province, Cambodia.
DESIGN: A population based survey.
METHODS: A total of 93 villages were selected through probability proportionate 
to size using the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness methodology. 
Households from 93 villages were selected using compact segment sampling. Visual 
acuity (VA) of 4650 people 50 years or older was tested and lens status and 
cause of visual impairment were assessed.
RESULTS: The response rate was 96.2%. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of 
bilateral blindness [presenting visual acuity (PVA) <3/60 in the better eye] was 
3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.8%-4.0%), resulting in an estimated 4187 people 
blind in Takeo Province. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of low vision (PVA 
<6/18 to 3/60) was 21.1%, an estimated 25,900 people. Cataract surgical coverage 
in the bilaterally blind was 64.7% (female 59.5%, male 78.1%). Cataract surgical 
outcome was poor (best-corrected visual acuity <6/60) in only 7.7% and good in 
88.7% (best-corrected visual acuity ≥6/18) of eyes operated in the last 5 years 
before the survey.
CONCLUSIONS: The cataract surgical coverage for women is less than that for men. 
The increased life expectancy in Cambodia and the fact that women constitute 
60.6% of the population (aged ≥50 years) at Takeo Province could have had an 
impact on cataract workload and high prevalence of blindness. A repeated survey 
using the same methodology after 8-12 years might be helpful in proving genuine 
change over time.

BACKGROUND: Although patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have a 
shortened life expectancy, their end-of-life (EOL) care is suboptimal. The aim 
of this study was to review the utilization of specialist palliative care (SPC) 
in patients with ESKD in Dublin, Ireland.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of prevalent patients with 
ESKD who died between January 2005 and December 2009 at a tertiary referral 
centre. We recorded SPC referrals, modality of renal replacement therapy, age 
and place of death.
RESULTS: Of 131 included patients, 88 (67.2%) were male, mean age at death was 
63.2 ± 15.1 years and 102 (77.9%) were treated with haemodialysis. Forty-eight 
patients (36.7%) were referred to SPC, who were involved in the patients' 
management for a median of 12 days (range 0-907) before death. A total 104 
patients (79.4%) died in an acute hospital, 19 (14.5%) died at home, 3 (2.3%) 
died in an inpatient hospice and the place of death was unknown for 5 patients 
(3.8%). Dialysis was withdrawn prior to death in 50 patients (38.1%), with a 
median time to death after withdrawal of dialysis of 6 days (0-105 days). A 
discussion regarding the withdrawal of dialysis was more frequently held with 
family member(s) rather than the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: SPC was involved in the antemortem care of ∼1/3 of the patients 
with the majority of referrals placed at a late stage. Given the short timeframe 
until death once dialysis is withdrawn, it is imperative that appropriate EOL 
care is instituted. This study identifies an underutilization of SPC and 
improved integration of palliative care and nephrology services may optimize EOL 
care for patients with ESKD.

Given the growing aged care population, the complexity of their 
medication-related needs and increased risk of adverse drug events, there is a 
necessity to systematically monitor and manage medication-related quality of 
care. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise 
medication-related quality of care indicators with respect to application to 
residential aged care. MEDLINE (Ovid), Psychinfo, CINAHL, Embase and Google® 
were searched from 2001 to 2013 for studies that were in English, focused on 
older people aged 65+ years and discussed the development, application or 
validation of original medication-related quality of care indicators. The 
quality of selected articles was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills 
Program and psychometric qualities extracted and synthesised using content 
analysis. Indicators were mapped to six medication-related quality of care 
attributes and a minimum indicator set derived. Thirty three articles describing 
25 indicator sets met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen (52%) contained 
prescribing quality indicators only. Eight (32%) were developed specifically for 
aged care. Twenty three (92%) were validated and seven (28%) assessed for 
reliability. The most common attribute addressed was medication appropriateness 
(n = 24). There were no indicators for evaluating medication use in those with 
limited life expectancy, which resulted in only five of the six attributes being 
addressed. The developed minimum indicator set contains 28 indicators 
representing 22 of 25 identified indicator sets. Whilst a wide variety of 
validated indicator sets exist, none addressed all aspects of medication-related 
quality of care pertinent to residential aged care. The minimum indicator set is 
intended as a foundation for comprehensively evaluating medication-related 
quality of care in this setting. Future work should focus on bridging identified 
gaps.

STUDY DESIGN: Independent retrospective review of prospectively collected data, 
comparative cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical, 
radiographical, and cost/value of the addition of an interbody arthrodesis (IBA) 
to a posterolateral arthrodesis (PLA) in the surgical treatment of L4-L5 
degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). The authors hypothesized that the addition 
of IBA to PLA would produce added value while incurring minimal additional 
costs.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many lumbar surgical advances have been made during 
the past several decades, yet there is a paucity of strong evidence-based 
validation, let alone comparative value analyses. The addition of an IBA to a 
PLA has become increasingly popular during the past 2 decades, yet the potential 
added value for the patient has not been carefully defined.
METHODS: Patients undergoing single-level arthrodesis for L4-L5 DS performed at 
our institution from 2004 to 2012 were identified. Exclusion criteria included 
multilevel arthrodesis, spinal stenosis requiring decompression at or above 
L2-L3, previous L4-L5 spinal fusion, spondylolisthesis of greater than 33% of 
the vertebral body, and use of minimally invasive surgery. Radiographical fusion 
status, epidemiological, surgical, and functional outcomes, and cost/value data 
were recorded or calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 179 patients with follow-up meeting inclusion criteria were 
identified: 68 with PLA alone and 111 with PLA + IBA. No statistical differences 
were noted in Oswestry Disability Index, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey 
scores, fusion rates, or cost/value at 6 months and at more than 3 years despite 
the PLA cohort being significantly older with more medical comorbidities. When 
length of stay was normalized across cohorts, the addition of an IBA increased 
hospital costs ranging from $577 to $5276, but this did not reach statistical 
significance.
CONCLUSION: This single-center review of open surgical treatment of L4-L5 DS 
demonstrated that the addition of IBA to PLA added cost while producing 
equivalent results in fusion rates, Oswestry Disability Index, and 36-item 
Short-Form Health Survey scores when compared with PLA alone.

IMPORTANCE: Sudden cardiac death is a leading cause of mortality in psychiatric 
patients. Long QT (LQT) is common in this population and predisposes to 
Torsades-de-Pointes (TdP) and subsequent mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of electrocardiographic screening 
to detect LQT in psychiatric inpatients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We built a decision analytic model based on a 
decision tree to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and utility of LQT screening 
from a health care perspective. LQT proportion parameters were derived from an 
in-hospital cross-sectional study. We performed experts' elicitation to estimate 
the risk of TdP, given extent of QT prolongation. A TdP reduction of 65% after 
LQT detection was based on positive drug dechallenge rate and through adequate 
treatment and electrolyte adjustments. The base-case model uncertainty was 
assessed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, the TdP 
related mortality and TdP avoidance parameters were varied in a two-way 
sensitivity analysis to assess their effect on the Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, Quality Ajusted Life Year (QALY), ICER, and 
probability of cost effectiveness thresholds ($ 10,000, $25,000, and $50,000 per 
QALY).
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the numbers of patients needed to screen 
were 1128 and 2817 to avoid one TdP and one death, respectively. The ICER of 
systematic ECG screening was $8644 (95%CI, 3144-82 498) per QALY. The 
probability of cost-effectiveness was 96% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 for 
one QALY. In sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to the case-fatality 
of TdP episodes and to the TdP reduction following the diagnosis of LQT.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In psychiatric hospitals, performing systematic ECG 
screening at admission help reduce the number of sudden cardiac deaths in a 
cost-effective fashion.
