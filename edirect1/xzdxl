BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir is usually not often prescribed (or reimbursed) for 
non-high-risk patients consulting for influenza-like-illness (ILI) in primary 
care in Europe. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding 
oseltamivir to usual primary care in adults/adolescents (13 years +) and 
children with ILI during seasonal influenza epidemics, using data collected in 
an open-label, multi-season, randomised controlled trial of oseltamivir in 15 
European countries.
METHODS: Direct and indirect cost estimates were based on patient reported 
resource use and official country-specific unit costs. Health-Related Quality of 
Life was assessed by EQ-5D questionnaires. Costs and quality adjusted life-years 
(QALY) were bootstrapped (N = 10,000) to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER), from both the healthcare payers' and the societal perspectives, 
with uncertainty expressed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
expected value for perfect information (EVPI) analysis. Additionally, scenario 
(self-reported spending), comorbidities subgroup and country-specific analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: The healthcare payers' expected ICERs of oseltamivir were €22,459 per 
QALY gained in adults/adolescents and €13,001 in children. From the societal 
perspective, oseltamivir was cost-saving in adults/adolescents, but the ICER is 
€8,344 in children. Large uncertainties were observed in subgroups with 
comorbidities, especially for children. The expected ICERs and extent of 
decision uncertainty varied between countries (EVPI ranged €1-€35 per patient).
CONCLUSION: Adding oseltamivir to primary usual care in Europe is likely to be 
cost-effective for treating adults/adolescents and children with ILI from the 
healthcare payers' perspective (if willingness-to-pay per QALY gained > €22,459) 
and cost-saving in adults/adolescents from a societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo massive femoral malignant tumor (MFMT) 
resection often exhibit shortened femoral metaphyseal juxta-articular segments. 
The use of a customized femoral endoprosthesis (CFE) with an intra-neck curved 
stem (INCS) has emerged as a viable reconstructive surgical strategy for these 
individuals. Relative to a cemented INCS, it remains unclear as to whether 
cementless INCS use is associated with improvements in functionality or 
reconstructive longevity. As such, the present study was conducted to compare 
functional outcomes, endoprosthetic survival, and endoprosthesis-related 
complication rates in patients undergoing cemented and cementless INCS 
implantation.
METHODS: A total of 24 patients undergoing lower limb salvage and reconstructive 
surgical procedures utilizing cemented or cementless INCS endoprostheses were 
retrospectively included. Patient-functional outcomes, endoprosthetic survival, 
and complication rates were compared as a function of age; diagnosis; the length 
of femoral resection; residual proximal femur length; Musculoskeletal Tumor 
Society (MSTS) scores; visual analog scale (VAS) scores; and the rates of 
implant breakage, periprosthetic infections, periprosthetic fractures, and 
aseptic loosening.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 56 months. Significant differences in the length 
of femoral resection (p<0.001) and residual proximal femur length were observed 
(p<0.001) between the cemented and cementless INCS groups. There were no 
differences in overall patient survival and aseptic loosening-associated 
endoprosthesis survival in the cemented and cementless groups. None of the 
included patients experienced periprosthetic fractures, infections, or implant 
breakage. Average respective MSTS and VAS scores did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing treatment for MFMTs, the use of a CFE with 
an INCS has emerged as a viable approach to hip-preserving reconstructive 
surgery. With appropriately designed individualized rehabilitative programs, 
good functional outcomes can be achieved for these endoprostheses, which are 
associated with low complication rates. Moreover, the selection between cemented 
or cementless INCS in the clinic should be made based on patient-specific 
factors, with cementless INCS implementation being preferable in younger 
patients with good-quality bone, the potential for long-term survival, and the 
osteotomy site near the lesser trochanter, whereas cemented INCS use should be 
favored for individuals who are older, have a shorter life expectancy, or have 
poor bone quality.

Oxidative chemical etching of metal nanoparticles (NPs) to produce holey 
graphene (hG) suffers from the presence of aggregated NPs on the graphene 
surface triggering heterogeneous etching rates and thereby producing irregular 
sized holes. To encounter such a challenge, we investigated the use of scanning 
probe block co-polymer lithography (SPBCL) to fabricate precisely positioned 
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on graphene surfaces with exquisite control over 
the NP size to prevent their aggregation and consequently produce uniformly 
distributed holes after oxidative chemical etching. SPBCL experiments were 
carried out via printing an ink suspension consisting of poly(ethylene 
oxide-b-2-vinylpyridine) and silver nitrate on a graphene surface in a selected 
pattern under controlled environmental and instrumental parameters followed by 
thermal annealing in a gaseous environment to fabricate AgNPs. Scanning electron 
microscopy revealed the uniform size distribution of AgNPs on the graphene 
surface with minimal to no aggregation. Four main sizes of AgNPs were obtained 
(37 ± 3, 45 ± 3, 54 ± 2, and 64 ± 3 nm) via controlling the printing force, 
z-piezo extension, and dwell time. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis 
validated the existence of elemental Ag on the graphene surface. Subsequent 
chemical etching of AgNPs using nitric acid (HNO3) with the aid of sonication 
and mechanical agitation produced holes of uniform size distribution generating 
hG. The obtained I D/I G ratios ≤ 0.96 measured by Raman spectroscopy were lower 
than those commonly reported for GO (I D/I G > 1), indicating the removal of 
more defective C atoms during the etching process to produce hG while preserving 
the remaining C atoms in ordered or crystalline structures. Indeed, SPBCL could 
be utilized to fabricate uniformly distributed AgNPs of controlled sizes on 
graphene surfaces to ultimately produce hG of uniform hole size distribution.

Nanotechnology has increasingly emerged as a promising tool for exploring new 
approaches, from treating complex conditions to early detection of the onset of 
multiple disease states. Tailored designer nanoparticles can now more 
comprehensively interact with their cellular targets and various pathogens due 
to a similar size range and tunable surface properties. The basic goal of drug 
delivery is to employ pharmaceuticals only where they are needed, with as few 
adverse effects and off-target consequences as possible. Rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) is a chronic inflammatory illness that leads to progressive loss of bone 
and cartilage, resulting in acute impairment, decreased life expectancy, and 
increased death rates. Recent advancements in treatment have significantly 
slowed the progression of the disease and improved the lives of many RA 
sufferers. Some patients, on the other hand, attain or maintain illness 
remission without needing to continue immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, a 
large percentage of patients do not respond to current treatments or acquire 
tolerance to them. As a result, novel medication options for RA therapy are 
still needed. Nanocarriers, unlike standard medications, are fabricated to 
transport drugs directly to the location of joint inflammation, evading systemic 
and negative effects. As a result, researchers are reconsidering medicines that 
were previously thought to be too hazardous for systemic delivery. This article 
gives an overview of contemporary nanotechnology-based tactics for treating 
rheumatoid arthritis, as well as how the nanotherapeutic regimen could be 
enhanced in the future.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the 
effectiveness of the National Health Inequality Strategy, which was conducted in 
England between 1999 and 2010.
DESIGN: Three databases (Ovid Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) and grey literature 
were searched for articles published that reported on changes in inequalities in 
health outcomes in England over the implementation period. Articles published 
between January 1999 and November 2021 were included. Title and abstracts were 
screened according to an eligibility criteria. Data were extracted from eligible 
studies, and risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized 
Studies of Interventions tool.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 10 311 unique studies, which were 
screened. 42 were reviewed in full text and 11 were included in the final 
review. Six studies contained data on inequalities of life expectancy or 
mortality, four on disease-specific mortality, three on infant mortality and 
three on morbidities. Early government reports suggested that inequalities in 
life expectancy and infant mortality had increased. However, later publications 
using more accurate data and more appropriate measures found that absolute and 
relative inequalities had decreased throughout the strategy period for both 
measures. Three of four studies found a narrowing of inequalities in all-cause 
mortality. Absolute inequalities in mortality due to cancer and cardiovascular 
disease decreased, but relative inequalities increased. There was a lack of 
change, or widening of inequalities in mental health, self-reported health, 
health-related quality of life and long-term conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: With respect to its aims, the strategy was broadly successful. 
Policymakers should take courage that progress on health inequalities is 
achievable with long-term, multiagency, cross-government action.

There are still few portable methods for monitoring lower limb joint 
coordination during the cutting movements (CM). This study aims to obtain the 
relevant motion biomechanical parameters of the lower limb joints at 90°, 135°, 
and 180° CM by collecting IMU data of the human lower limbs, and utilizing the 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural-network framework to predict the 
coordination variability of selected lower extremity couplings at the three CM 
directions. There was a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the three 
couplings during the swing, especially at 90° vs the other directions. At 135° 
and 180°, t13-he coordination variability of couplings was significantly greater 
than at 90° (p < 0.001). It is important to note that the coordination 
variability of Hip rotation/Knee flexion-extension was significantly higher at 
90° than at 180° (p < 0.001). By the LSTM, the CM coordination variability for 
90° (CMC = 0.99063, RMSE = 0.02358), 135° (CMC = 0.99018, RMSE = 0.02465) and 
180° (CMC = 0.99485, RMSE = 0.01771) were accurately predicted. The predictive 
model could be used as a reliable tool for predicting the coordination 
variability of different CM directions in patients or athletes and real-world 
open scenarios using inertial sensors.

Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of eHealth in palliative care is scarce. 
Oncokompas, a fully automated behavioral intervention technology, aims to 
support self-management in cancer patients. This study aimed to assess the 
cost-utility of the eHealth application Oncokompas among incurably ill cancer 
patients, compared to care as usual. In this randomized controlled trial, 
patients were randomized into the intervention group (access to Oncokompas) or 
the waiting-list control group (access after three months). Healthcare costs, 
productivity losses, and health status were measured at baseline and three 
months. Intervention costs were also taken into account. Non-parametric 
bootstrapping with 5000 replications was used to obtain 95% confidence intervals 
around the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A 
probabilistic approach was used because of the skewness of cost data. 
Altogether, 138 patients completed the baseline questionnaire and were randomly 
assigned to the intervention group (69) or the control group (69). In the base 
case analysis, mean total costs and mean total effects were non-significantly 
lower in the intervention group (-€806 and -0.01 QALYs). The probability that 
the intervention was more effective and less costly was 4%, whereas the 
probability of being less effective and less costly was 74%. Among patients with 
incurable cancer, Oncokompas does not impact incremental costs and seems 
slightly less effective in terms of QALYs, compared to care as usual. Future 
research on the costs of eHealth in palliative cancer care is warranted to 
assess the generalizability of the findings of this study.

Nanomaterials (NMs) inevitably adsorb proteins in blood and form "protein 
corona" upon intravenous administration as drug carriers, potentially changing 
the biological properties and intended functions. Inspired by anti-adhesion 
properties of natural proteins, herein, we employed the one-bead one-compound 
(OBOC) combinatorial peptide library method to screen anti-adhesion peptides 
(AAPs) against proteins. The library beads displaying random peptides were 
screened with three fluorescent-labeled plasma proteins. The nonfluorescence 
beads, presumed to have anti-adhesion property against the proteins, were 
isolated for sequence determination. These identified AAPs were coated on gold 
nanorods (GNRs), enabling significant extension of the blood circulating 
half-life of these GNRs in mice to 37.8 h, much longer than that (26.6 h) of 
PEG-coated GNRs. In addition, such AAP coating was found to alter the 
biodistribution profile of GNRs in mice. The bioinspired screening strategy and 
resulting peptides show great potential for enhancing the delivery efficiency 
and targeting ability of NMs.

This study presents, the development of a green method to produce rich in thymol 
natural zeolite (TO@NZ) nanostructures. This material was used to prepare 
sodium-alginate/glycerol/xTO@NZ (ALG/G/TO@NZ) nanocomposite active films for the 
packaging of soft cheese to extend its shelf-life. Differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), X-ray analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments were used for the 
characterization of such nanostructures and films, to identify the thymol 
adsorbed amount, to investigate the thermal behaviour, and to confirm the 
dispersion of nanostructure powder into the polymer matrix. Water vapor 
transmission rate, oxygen permeation analyzer, tensile measurements, antioxidant 
measurements, and antimicrobial measurements were used to estimate the film's 
water and oxygen barrier, mechanical properties, nanostructure's 
nanoreinforcement activity, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The findings 
from the study revealed that ALG/G/TO@NZ nanocomposite film could be used as an 
active packaging film for foods with enhanced, mechanical properties, oxygen and 
water barrier, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, and it is capable of 
extending food shelf-life.

AIMS: The provision of guideline-based care for patients with diabetes-related 
foot ulcers (DFU) in clinical practice is suboptimal. We estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of higher rates of guideline-based care, compared with 
current practice.
METHODS: The costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with 
current practice (30% of patients receiving guideline-based care) were compared 
with seven hypothetical scenarios with increasing proportion of guideline-based 
care (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%). Comparisons were made using 
discrete event simulations reflecting the natural history of DFU over a 3-year 
time horizon from the Australian healthcare perspective. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for each scenario and compared to a 
willingness-to-pay of AUD 28,000 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted to incorporate joint parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: All seven scenarios with higher rates of guideline-based care were 
likely cheaper and more effective than current practice. Increased proportions 
compared with current practice resulted in between AUD 0.28 and 1.84 million in 
cost savings and 11-56 additional QALYs per 1000 patients. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the finding is robust to parameter 
uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher proportions of patients receiving guideline-based care are 
less costly and improve patient outcomes. Strategies to increase the proportion 
of patients receiving guideline-based care are warranted.

During recent decades, bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) have continuously 
expanded their range in the Mediterranean climate regions of Israel. To assess 
their potential effects on local bee communities, we monitored their diurnal and 
seasonal activity patterns, as well as those of native bee species in the Judean 
Hills. We found that all bee species tend to visit pollen-providing flowers at 
earlier times compared to nectar-providing flowers. Bumble bees and honey bees 
start foraging at earlier times and colder temperatures compared to other 
species of bees. This means that the two species of commercially managed social 
bees are potentially depleting much of the pollen, which is typically 
non-replenished, before most local species arrive to gather it. Taking into 
consideration the long activity season of bumble bees in the Judean hills, their 
ability to forage at the low temperatures of the early morning, and their 
capacity to collect pollen at early hours in the dry Mediterranean climate, 
feral and range-expanding bumble bees potentially pose a significant competitive 
pressure on native bee fauna. Their effects on local bees can further modify 
pollination networks, and lead to changes in the local flora.

Energy is considered a vital factor of economic growth that contributes to 
improve quality of life and health status. However, global warming, climate 
change, and environmental degradation are due primarily because of energy 
emissions, whereas environmental degradation is detrimental to health. Since 
one-fifth of the population lives in South Asia, it is necessary to analyze the 
impact of energy and environmental degradation on health status in this region. 
For this purpose, health status in South Asia is proxy with health expenditure, 
life expectancy, and infant mortality, and this study investigates the effect of 
energy intensity, income, and carbon emissions on health status, whereas 
urbanization is considered a control variable. The cointegration test indicates 
South Asia's long-term health status factors are energy intensity, income, 
carbon emissions, and urbanization. Long-run results suggest that energy 
intensity and income improve health status as these factors reduce health 
expenditure, improve life expectancy, and decrease infant mortality. 
Environmental degradation not only increases health expenditure but also hinders 
life expectancy and increases mortality. Moreover, an increase in income 
diminishes health expenditure and is responsible for high life expectancy and 
low mortality in South Asia.

Erratum in

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
allogeneic umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells with sodium 
hyaluronate (hUCB-MSC) compared with microfracture in patients with knee 
cartilage defects caused by osteoarthritis (OA) in South Korea.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model approach was taken consisting of five 
mutually exclusive health states: excellent, good, fair, poor, and death over a 
20-year time horizon. Utility values were obtained from a randomized clinical 
trial. Cost data were extracted from a database provided by the Health Insurance 
Review & Assessment Service, and the utilization of healthcare services was 
estimated from an expert panel of orthopedic surgeons using a structured 
questionnaire. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) was calculated. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental costs of US$14,410 for hUCB-MSC 
therapy along with its associated QALY gain of 0.857 resulted in an ICER of 
US$16,812 (₩18,790,773) per QALY (95% confidence interval [CI] 
US$13,408-US$20,828) when compared with microfracture treatment from a 
healthcare payer perspective. From a societal perspective, the ICER was US$268 
(₩299,255) per QALY (95% CI -US$2915 to US$3784). When using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of US$22,367/QALY, the probability of hUCB being 
cost effectiveness compared with microfracture was 99% from the healthcare payer 
perspective and 100% from the societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that hUCB-MSC therapy was cost effective 
compared with microfracture when treating patients with knee OA. These findings 
should inform health policy decision makers about considerations for 
cost-effective therapy for treating knee OA to ultimately enhance population 
health.

IMPORTANCE: Approximately 50% of all patients with cancer have an indication for 
radiotherapy, and approximately 50% of radiotherapy is delivered with palliative 
intent, with the aim of alleviating symptoms. Symptoms are best assessed by 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs), yet their reliable interpretation requires 
adequate reporting in publications.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use and reporting of PROs in clinical trials of 
palliative radiotherapy.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: This preregistered systematic review searched PubMed/Medline, 
EMBASE, and the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials for clinical 
trials of palliative radiotherapy published from 1990 to 2020. Key eligibility 
criteria were palliative setting, palliative radiotherapy as treatment modality, 
and clinical trial design (per National Institutes of Health definition). Two 
authors independently assessed eligibility. Trial characteristics were extracted 
and standard of PRO reporting was assessed in adherence to the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO extension. The association of the 
year of publication with the use of PROs was assessed by logistic regression. 
Factors associated with higher CONSORT-PRO adherence were analyzed by multiple 
regression. This study is reported following the PRISMA guidelines.
FINDINGS: Among 7377 records screened, 225 published clinical trials 
representing 24 281 patients were eligible. Of these, 45 trials (20%) used a PRO 
as a primary end point and 71 trials (31%) used a PRO as a secondary end point. 
The most prevalent PRO measures were the Numeric Rating Scale/Visual Analogue 
Scale (38 trials), European Organization for the Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (32 trials), and trial-specific 
unvalidated measures (25 trials). A more recent year of publication was 
significantly associated with a higher chance of PROs as a secondary end point 
(odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.07]; P = .03) but not as primary end 
point. Adherence to CONSORT-PRO was poor or moderate for most items. Mean (SD) 
adherence to the extension adherence score was 46.2% (19.6%) for trials with 
PROs as primary end point and 31.8% (19.8%) for trials with PROs as a secondary 
end point. PROs as a primary end point (regression coefficient, 9.755 [95% CI, 
2.270-17.240]; P = .01), brachytherapy as radiotherapy modality (regression 
coefficient, 16.795 [95% CI, 5.840-27.751]; P = .003), and larger sample size 
(regression coefficient, 0.028 [95% CI, 0.006-0.049]; P = .01) were 
significantly associated with better PRO reporting per extension adherence 
score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review of palliative radiotherapy 
trials, the use and reporting of PROs had room for improvement for future 
trials, preferably with PROs as a primary end point.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being performed in 
younger and lower surgical risk patients. Given the longer life expectancy of 
these patients, the bioprosthetic valve will eventually fail, and aortic valve 
reintervention may be necessary. Although currently rare, redo-TAVR will likely 
increase in the future as younger patients are expected to outlive their 
transcatheter bioprosthesis. This review provides a contemporary overview of the 
indications, procedural planning, implantation technique, and outcomes of TAVR 
in failed transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves.
