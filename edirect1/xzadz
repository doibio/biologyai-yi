Watchful-waiting policy is an important treatment option for some patients with 
localized prostate cancer and it is widely recognized in Western countries in 
which the prostate cancer mortality rate is 510 fold higher than that in Japan. 
Most men with well and perhaps moderately differentiated prostate cancer who 
have a life expectancy of less than 10 years will die of other causes and it is 
not clear whether early primary hormone therapy improves survival and the 
quality of life compared to androgen suppression deferred until signs and 
symptoms of clinical progression. There is one major question as to whether 
patients who do not need radical treatment should undergo early primary hormone 
therapy in Japan in spite of high cost and treatment-related adverse effects of 
hormone therapy.

Aging research in vertebrates is hampered by the lack of short-lived models. 
Annual fishes of the genus Nothobranchius live in East African seasonal ponds. 
Their life expectancy in the wild is limited by the duration of the wet season 
and their lifespan in captivity is also short. Nothobranchius are popular 
aquarium fishes and many different species are kept as captive strains, 
providing rich material for comparative studies. The present paper aims at 
reviving the interest in these fishes by reporting that: (1) Nothobranchius can 
be cultured, and their eggs stored dry at room temperature for months or years, 
offering inexpensive methods of embryo storage; (2) Nothobranchius show 
accelerated growth and expression of aging biomarkers at the level of histology 
and behaviour; (3) the species Nothobranchius furzeri has a maximum lifespan of 
only 3 months and offers the possibility to perform investigations thus far 
unthinkable in a vertebrate, such as drug screening with life-long 
pharmacological treatments and experimental evolution; (4) when the lifespan of 
different species is compared, a general correlation is found between wet season 
duration in their natural habitat and longevity in captivity; and (5) vertebrate 
aging-related genes, such as p66Shc and MTP, can be easily isolated in 
Nothobranchius by homology cloning. These fishes can become excellent models for 
aging studies. They can be employed to test the effects of experimental 
manipulation on aging at a pace comparable with that of Drosophila and to probe 
the effects of natural selection on the evolution of aging-related genes.

BACKGROUND: The growing problem of relentless deterioration of renal function in 
patients who undergo transplantation of nonrenal solid organs is bound to have 
an increasingly important impact as it may not only worsen patient morbidity and 
mortality but also increase transplantation costs.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature in order to provide a sum of the most 
important data on the incidence, clinical picture, renal pathology pattern, 
damage mechanisms, and risk factors, along with strategies for prevention and 
treatment of chronic renal damage following nonrenal solid organ 
transplantation.
RESULTS: Literature data report that 10% to 80% of transplanted patients have 
some degree of renal dysfunction and that they share a common clinical picture 
characterized by relentless asymptomatic progression, frequent hypertension, 
mild urinary abnormalities, and pathology features of vascular, glomerular, 
tubular, and interstitial involvement. These changes are very similar to those 
reported for chronic nephrotoxicity from calcineurin inhibitors. The occurrence 
of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic dialysis has been reported 
in up to 20% of nonrenal transplant recipients. Although there are some 
organ-specific differences, a group of common risk factors has been recognized, 
including the use of calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressive agents, age, 
pretransplantation renal function, intraoperative/perioperative factors, 
concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, infections, and posttransplantation 
acute renal failure.
CONCLUSION: Calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity is a growing problem 
and, as the age of recipients of nonrenal organs is increasing, this problem is 
destined to increase. It would therefore be advisable for nephrologists to share 
their experiences in immunomodulation with other specialties, so as to favor the 
cautious extension of calcineurin inhibitor-sparing protocols to the area of 
life-saving transplants.

[Mammaplasty and the aesthetically correct: breast and medias].

This article discusses how the norms of the aesthetically correct breast, the 
physiological characteristics of the breast, the increase in life expectancy, 
and the possibility of cosmetic surgery all influence the demand of breast 
modification. It then reviews the various stances of the medias on the subject, 
looking at the print medias, women's magazines, TV documentaries and reality 
shows. There is a paradox between a social context of hardening of the norms, 
encouragement of well-being and self-realisation, tolerance ideal, and the 
reality of quite a denial of the women's rights to choose their mammary 
appearance. The article seeks to elucidate historical, philosophical, social, 
religious and ideological obstacles. Finally, a new analysis chart looking at 
stances on the issue of cosmetic breast surgery is proposed, according to two 
criteria: "Doing" and "Saying". This chart will help the surgeon to better 
decode the demand of each patient in order to better come up to her 
expectations.

Quadrangle, Liverpool L69 3GB, UK. debbi@liv.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between levels of patriarchy and male health 
by comparing female homicide rates with male mortality within countries.
HYPOTHESIS: High levels of patriarchy in a society are associated with increased 
mortality among men.
DESIGN: Cross sectional ecological study design.
SETTING: 51 countries from four continents were represented in the data-America, 
Europe, Australasia, and Asia. No data were available for Africa.
RESULTS: A multivariate stepwise linear regression model was used. Main outcome 
measure was age standardised male mortality rates for 51 countries for the year 
1995. Age standardised female homicide rates and GDP per capita ranking were the 
explanatory variables in the model. Results were also adjusted for the effects 
of general rates of homicide. Age standardised female homicide rates and ranking 
of GDP were strongly correlated with age standardised male mortality rates 
(Pearson's r=0.699 and Spearman's 0.744 respectively) and both correlations 
achieved significance (p<0.005). Both factors were subsequently included in the 
stepwise regression model. Female homicide rates explained 48.8% of the variance 
in male mortality, and GDP a further 13.6% showing that the higher the rate of 
female homicide, and hence the greater the indicator of patriarchy, the higher 
is the rate of mortality among men.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that oppression and exploitation harm the 
oppressors as well as those they oppress, and that men's higher mortality is a 
preventable social condition, which could be tackled through global social 
policy measures.

Population health. More than the sum of the parts?

Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH, UK. daniel.reidpath@brunel.ac.uk

The past decade has seen an upsurge of interest in the development of summary 
measures of population health. Almost invariably the measures have relied on 
"rolling up" individual level health data such as mortality data or life 
expectancy data. The approach, however, of treating population health as a 
synthesis of aggregated individual level data is a historical and statistical 
convenience. Although there has been some debate in the literature about whether 
one should also examine the equity of the distribution of health, the general 
practice has been to treat the level of a population's health and the 
distribution of health within a population as separate issues. Without recourse 
to contentious notions of equity, this paper examines the possibility of 
treating populations as more than simply the sum of their parts by combining 
individual level health data with population level data about the distribution 
of health. This approach may provide policy makers with additional ways of 
thinking about what it means to improve a population's health.

Gene codon composition determines differentiation-dependent expression of a 
viral capsid gene in keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo.

By establishing mouse primary keratinocytes (KCs) in culture, we were able, for 
the first time, to express papillomavirus major capsid (L1) proteins by 
transient transfection of authentic or codon-modified L1 gene expression 
plasmids. We demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that gene codon composition is in 
part responsible for differentiation-dependent expression of L1 protein in KCs. 
L1 mRNA was present in similar amounts in differentiated and undifferentiated 
KCs transfected with authentic or codon-modified L1 genes and had a similar 
half-life, demonstrating that L1 protein production is posttranscriptionally 
regulated. We demonstrate further that KCs substantially change their tRNA 
profiles upon differentiation. Aminoacyl-tRNAs from differentiated KCs but not 
undifferentiated KCs enhanced the translation of authentic L1 mRNA, suggesting 
that differentiation-associated change to tRNA profiles enhances L1 expression 
in differentiated KCs. Thus, our data reveal a novel mechanism for regulation of 
gene expression utilized by a virus to direct viral capsid protein expression to 
the site of virion assembly in mature KCs. Analysis of two structural proteins 
of KCs, involucrin and keratin 14, suggests that translation of their mRNAs is 
also regulated, in association with KC differentiation in vitro, by a similar 
mechanism.

University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands. dbru@kemta.azm.nl

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to determine the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of a clinical pathway for patients undergoing joint 
replacement, the Joint Recovery Programme (JRP), as compared with usual care. 
The existing care process was revised to contain costs and shorten waiting lists 
by facilitating patient flows and improve healthcare efficiency.
METHODS: The study design was a before-after trial. In total, 160 patients 
undergoing total hip and total knee replacement, aged 28 to 87 years (mean age, 
64.4 years), were treated either according to the Joint Recovery Programme (a 
standardized care process with patient education and rehabilitation in groups) 
or usual care. Both groups were followed for 1 year. Costs were studied from a 
societal perspective. Outcomes included functional level (Harris Hip score and 
American Knee Society score) and generic quality of life (EuroQol).
RESULTS: The results indicate that the Joint Recovery Programme resulted in a 
significant cost saving when compared with usual care mainly as a result of a 
considerable (>50%) reduction in length of hospital stay. The average cost 
saving per patient amounted to $1261 in the total hip replacement group and 
$3336 in the total knee replacement group. At the same time, both functional 
level and quality of life were higher in the JRP group.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical pathway dominates usual care and is a highly 
cost-effective approach to contain costs related to joint replacement surgery 
without adverse consequences for patients.

Angeles, California 90095-1736, USA. mitchellwong@mednet.ucla.edu

BACKGROUND: Understanding differences in cause-specific mortality between 
Latinos and whites is important for targeting future public health interventions 
and research aimed at eliminating health disparities.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the contribution of specific causes of death 
to Latino-white differences in mortality.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Using nationally representative data, we estimated 
cause-specific mortality risks, which were then used in a simulation model to 
estimate mortality events for a cohort of persons starting at age 25 and 
followed until death or age 75.
SUBJECTS: Subjects were 507,820 Latino and white adults, age 25 or older, who 
participated in the 1986-1994 National Health Interview Surveys.
MEASURES: Outcomes were years of potential life lost before age 75 from specific 
causes of death and age-specific mortality rate ratios for Latinos compared with 
whites.
RESULTS: Latinos had higher mortality rates than whites before age 45 and 
similar mortality rates at older ages. Latino women lost 315 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 229-2423) more years of potential life (per 1000 persons before 
the age of 75) than white women and Latino men lost 595 (95% CI, 513-1675) more 
years than white men. For both men and women, whites lost substantially more 
years of potential life than Latinos from lung cancer. Homicide, diabetes, HIV, 
and liver disease contributed most to the excess years of potential life lost 
among Latino men, and diabetes and HIV contributed most to the excess years of 
potential life lost among Latino women.
CONCLUSIONS: To eliminate health disparities between Latinos and whites, future 
health policy and public health efforts should target diabetes, homicide, HIV, 
and liver disease among Latinos and lung cancer among whites.

Helicobacter pylori-associated ulcer bleeding: should we test for eradication 
after treatment?

Pohl H(1), Finlayson SR, Sonnenberg A, Robertson DJ.

Author information:

Junction, VT, USA. heiko.pohl@dartmouth.edu

BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori after peptic ulcer haemorrhage 
reduces the risk of recurrence. Because H. pylori treatment is very effective, 
it is unclear whether testing to confirm eradication is worthwhile.
AIMS: To examine whether patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer 
haemorrhage should be tested for successful eradication after completion of 
antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: A Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare testing vs. 
non-testing of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Probability 
estimates and average costs were derived from published information.
RESULTS: Testing for H. pylori eradication resulted in a benefit of 0.07 
quality-adjusted life-years and cost 836 US dollars less than the strategy of 
not confirming eradication. Testing remained the superior strategy when varying 
the model regarding age, the initial success of eradication, various test and 
retreatment strategies, and the rate and costs of recurrent bleeding. Assuming a 
high eradication rate (95%), the test strategy becomes more expensive only if 
the cost of H. pylori testing reaches 265 US dollars; however, even under these 
conditions it remains cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer bleeding should be 
tested to confirm eradiation of H. pylori after completion of antibiotic 
treatment.

Despite a follow-up too short to allow a relevant assessment of the HIFU 
efficacy in terms of definitive cure of localized prostate cancer, the last 
published results from the European multicentric study and from Gelet may 
consider the HIFU treatment as a valuable alternative option for well 
differentiated tumors, with an initial PSA<15 ng/ml, in men with a life 
expectancy more than 5 years. The main advantages of the HIFU treatment are its 
low morbidity, the option for repeated HIFU treatment, the possible treatment of 
patients who previously underwent prostate resection, the early local control 
with biopsies and, if needed, radiotherapy may be performed after HIFU, without 
increased morbidity.

Aortic coarctation repair--lost and found: the role of local long term 
specialised care.

de Bono J(1), Freeman LJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Colney 
Lane, Norwich, UK.

BACKGROUND: Aortic coarctation is associated with significant abnormalities of 
the underlying vasculature. Surgical repair, although relieving obstruction, is 
not a cure; patients continue to have a high risk of complications with a 
significantly reduced life expectancy. It has become increasingly apparent that 
they require regular specialised follow up lifelong. However provision of such 
services is limited particularly for patients living some distance from the 
largest cities where specialised adult congenital heart disease services tend to 
based. We carried out a notes-based study to look at the adequacy of long term 
follow up in such patients and to assess the role of a local specialist 
cardiology service in managing these patients.
METHODS: We carried out a notes-based study of 55 patients with aortic 
coarctation referred to a new specialist grown up congenital heart disease 
clinic based in a large district general hospital over 100 miles from the 
nearest surgical centre specialising in adult congenital heart disease.
RESULTS: A significant proportion of the patients in this study had already 
suffered major complications by the time of referral. Despite this, nearly half 
had, at some stage, been lost to follow up and a third had been referred from 
the community with new complications. 52% of the women had produced children 
often with little cardiological support. Few patients had had any specialised 
imaging. At initial review in the clinic, 41% had significant hypertension, 
although only a small proportion were on antihypertensives. Following initial 
review in the specialist GUCH clinic, new medications were initiated in 55%, 
mostly for hypertension; aortic imaging was performed in 94%; and 22% were 
referred for further specialist investigation or invasive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that many patients with previous repair of 
aortic coarctation have not received optimal long term care. Many had been lost 
to regular cardiology follow up and, even amongst those who had been seen in 
cardiology clinics, there was a high frequency of poorly treated or unsuspected 
complications. The provision of local expert care from a cardiologist 
specialising in congenital heart disease allows earlier and more aggressive 
treatment of complications and may also improve compliance. Where a localised 
specialist is not available, general cardiologists need to work to 
protocol-driven care pathways with easy access to specialist support.

Cost-effectiveness of pravastatin for primary prevention of coronary artery 
disease in Japan.

Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawahara-cho Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, 
Japan.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
pravastatin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in Japan.
METHODS: A state-transition model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
pravastatin therapy with no intervention. Hypothetical cohorts were assumed 
according to patients' age, sex, initial serum total cholesterol (TC) levels, 
and other cardiac risk factors. For the baseline analysis, 20 mg/day of 
pravastatin was used for people aged 60 years who had an initial TC level of 240 
mg/dl. Epidemiological, clinical, and economic data were collected from 
published articles. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in yen per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated. To confirm the effects of 
different variables, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The assumptions of 
our model were in accordance with the Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines 
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: ICERs were respectively 44 million and 76 million yen/QALY for men and 
women at low cardiac risk (i.e., the risks of hypercholesterolemia and old age) 
and 7.5 million and 4.3 million yen/QALY for those at high cardiac risk (i.e., 
the risks of hypercholesterolemia, old age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and 
hyperglycemia).
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of pravastatin therapy differs substantially 
according to the level of cardiac risk. At present, pravastatin therapy is not 
cost-effective for persons at low cardiac risk.

Health information systems - past, present, future.

In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of 
hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous 
progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this 
progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it 
would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging 
societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future 
development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter 
Reichertz' lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two 
questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information 
systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information 
systems in the future? The following lines of development for HIS were 
considered as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based 
processing and storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; 
(2) the shift from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital 
information systems towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of 
patients and health consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals 
and administrators; (4) the use of HIS data not only for patient care and 
administrative purposes, but also for health care planning as well as clinical 
and epidemiological research; (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical 
HIS problems to those of change management as well as of strategic information 
management; (6) the shift from mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and 
now also to data on the molecular level; (7) the steady increase of new 
technologies to be included, now starting to include ubiquitous computing 
environments and sensor-based technologies for health monitoring. As 
consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for institutional and 
(inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to explore new 
(transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for education in 
health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including appropriate 
knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for 
reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for 
research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and 
investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system 
architectures, of adequate methods for strategic information management, of 
methods for modeling and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of 
comprehensive electronic patient records, providing appropriate access for 
health care professionals as well as for patients, in the broad sense as 
described here, e.g. including home care and health monitoring facilities. 
Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004, we have to recognize that we 
imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS have become one of the most 
challenging and promising fields of research, education and practice for medical 
informatics, with significant benefits to medicine and health care in general.

AIM: To ascertain utility values and associated quality of life with different 
severity and duration of glaucoma among Indian patients.
METHODS: Utility values of 105 consecutive patients with primary glaucoma of at 
least 12 months' duration were evaluated in a cross sectional study. Utility 
values were ascertained in five groups using both the time-trade off and 
standard gamble methods: group 1 (best corrected visual acuity in the better eye 
of 6/9 or better), group 2 (best corrected visual acuity in the better eye of 
6/18 to 6/12), group 3 (best corrected visual acuity in the better eye of 6/36 
to6/24), group 4 (best corrected visual acuity in the better eye of 3/60 to 
6/60), and group 5 (best corrected visual acuity in the better eye of 3/60 or 
worse).
RESULTS: The mean utility value for the glaucoma group as a whole was 0.64 (SD 
0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58 to 0.70) with the time-trade off method 
and 0.86 (SD 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90) with the standard gamble method for a 
gamble of death and 0.97 (SD 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99) for a gamble of 
blindness. The mean utility results by the time-trade off method were as 
follows: group 1 = 0.66, group 2 = 0.66, group 3 = 0.62, group 4 = 0.55, and 
group 5 = 0.61. The utility value was much lower (0.46) in those with no formal 
education or only primary education compared to those with postgraduate 
education (0.75) (p = 0.038). Those patients with glaucoma of less than 5 years' 
duration had a utility score of 0.62 while those with glaucoma for more than 10 
years had a score of 0.74 (p = 0.40).
CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity loss occurring secondary to glaucoma is associated 
with a substantial decrease in patient utility value (and quality of life) in a 
developing country like India. The utility value is directly dependent on the 
degree of visual acuity loss associated with the disease and educational status 
and not on the duration of disease, the number of medications, or the visual 
field indices.

[Cardiovascular comorbidity in rheumatic disease. Does sex play a role?].

The importance of sex- and gender-related features of various diseases regarding 
the impact of different risk factors on the natural course of disease, the 
response to therapy and outcome have only more recently been appreciated. 
Studies investigating sex- and gender-related aspects in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) are scarce. Unambiguous classification of factors of potential pathogenetic 
relevance or with the capacity to influence clinical course and disease 
management into sex- or gender- related aspects is difficult (Figure 1). The 
majority of RA patients is female. As illustrated by Figure 2, available 
evidence indicates a progressive decline in the incidence of this disease over 
the past 40 years in both men and women. There appears to be a cyclical pattern 
in the annual incidence rates with peaks and troughs occurring for both sexes, 
but at different times, which suggests the changing exposure to environmental 
factors which may promote or decrease RA. Current knowledge suggests that RA is 
characterized by chronic local and systemic inflammation which may trigger 
accelerated atherogenesis. Sex hormones may also play a pathogenetic role. 
Androgens and estrogens may stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines 
in the synovial fluid. These cytokines then may influence sex hormone metabolism 
thus modifying sex hormone levels (Figure 3). Compared to the general population 
(Figures 4 and 5), the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is 
significantly increased in patients with rheumatic diseases and in particular in 
RA. This is evidenced by a higher incidence of congestive heart failure (Figure 
6), coronary artery disease and (frequently silent) myocardial infarction, as 
well as sudden cardiac death. Several studies have demonstrated a significantly 
increased standardized mortality ratio in RA and identified cardiovascular 
events as the most frequent cause. Compared with expected mortality rates in the 
normal population, women with RA have a significantly more compromised life 
expectancy than men (Table 1). Amongst factors with uneven distribution between 
sexes are traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Table 2), but also more 
recently recognized potential risk indicators or risk modifiers such as 
inflammatory markers and sex hormones. Drugs directed against RA may influence 
the natural course of cardiovascular disease, as, e. g., indicated by the 
increased rates of cardiac events and stroke associated with 
cyclooxygenase-(COX-)2 inhibitor treatment. In contrast, the effect of 
pharmacotherapy for cardiovascular diseases on the course of RA is unexplored. 
Prospective cohort studies aiming at early detection of cardiovascular morbidity 
and precise and detailed characterization of disease manifestations will be 
required in order to more thoroughly understand the interplay of factors and 
conditions determining an individuals' risk for developing cardiovascular 
comorbidity in autoimmune diseases. This article summarizes the available 
evidence for sex- and gender-related differences in the disease manifestation of 
rheumatic disorders as well as in cardiovascular risk factors with an emphasis 
on the cardiovascular comorbidity observed in RA.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most frequent form of primary myocardial 
diseases and the third most common cause of heart failure. Clinically, DCM is 
characterized by a progressive course of ventricular dilatation and systolic 
dysfunction. The life expectancy is limited and varies according to the 
underlying etiology with a median survival time of about 5 years after 
diagnosis. Myocarditis, immunologic abnormalities, toxic myocardial damage, and 
genetic factors are all assumed to be causes. Familial occurrence of DCM, mostly 
as an autosomal dominant trait, is more common than generally believed and is 
responsible for 20-30% of all cases of DCM. Candidate gene screening and linkage 
analyses in large families were successful in identifying 24 disease genes. 
There is a wide variability in the onset, course and severity of the disease 
even within the same family. In addition, genotype-phenotype correlations 
included only small numbers of affected. This implies that in most cases no 
conclusion can be drawn from the clinical manifestation of DCM to the 
responsible disease gene. Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain and in 
cardiac troponin T are common causes of pure familial DCM. DCM associated with 
conduction disease is mainly due to mutations in lamin A/C and X-linked DCM is 
often caused by mutations in dystrophin. All other disease genes are rare causes 
of familial DCM. Genetic screening in all known disease genes is not possible, 
but more efficient screening methods are awaited in the near future. Until then, 
clinical examination of family members and, in case of familial DCM, genetic 
counseling are recommended in the work-up of patients with idiopathic DCM.

Mid- and long-term device migration after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm 
repair: a comparison of AneuRx and Zenith endografts.

BACKGROUND: Freedom from migration is key to the durability of endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study evaluates the mid- and long-term incidence of 
migration with two different endografts.
METHODS: Between September 1997 and June 2004, 235 patients were scheduled for 
EVAR with an AneuRx (Medtronic/AVE Inc.) or Zenith (Cook) endograft. Patients 
with fusiform, infrarenal aneurysms and a minimum 12 months of follow-up were 
analyzed, for a final cohort of 130 patients. Migration was assessed on axial 
computed tomography (CT) (2.5 to 3 mm cuts) as the distance from the most caudal 
renal artery to the first slice containing endograft (AneuRx) or to the top of 
the bare suprarenal stent (Zenith). Aortic neck diameters were measured at the 
most caudal renal artery. The initial postoperative CT scan was the baseline. 
Migration was defined by caudal movement of the endograft at two thresholds, > 
or =5 mm and > or =10 mm, or any migration with a related clinical event.
RESULTS: Life-table analysis demonstrated AneuRx freedom from migration (> or 
=10 mm or clinical event) was 96.1%, 89.5%, 78.0%, and 72.0% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 
years, respectively. Zenith freedom from migration was 100%, 97.6%, 97.6%, and 
97.6% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively (P = .01, log-rank test). The 
stricter 5-mm migration threshold found 67.4% of AneuRx and 90.1% of Zenith 
patients free from migration at 4 years of follow-up. Twelve out of 14 (85.7%) 
AneuRx patients (12/14) with migration (> or =10 mm or clinical event) underwent 
14 related secondary procedures (13 endovascular, 1 open conversion). The single 
Zenith patient with migration (> or =10 mm) has not required adjuvant treatment. 
Mean follow-up was 39.0 +/- 2.3 months (AneuRx) and 30.8 +/- 1.9 months (Zenith, 
P = .01). Patients with and without migration did not differ in age, gender 
ratio, aneurysm diameter, and neck diameter. However, initial neck length was 
shorter in patients with migration (22.1 +/- 2.1 mm vs 31.2 +/- 1.2 mm, P = 
.02). A subset of patients (21.6%) experienced significant (defined as > or =3 
mm) maximum aortic neck dilation. Of the AneuRx patients, > or =3 mm aortic neck 
dilation affected 30.8% of migrators vs 13.0% of nonmigrators (P = .20).
CONCLUSIONS: Endograft migration is a time-dependent phenomenon affected by both 
device choice and aortic neck length. A great majority of patients (85.7%) with 
migration of the AneuRx device ultimately required treatment. A minority of 
patients experienced aortic neck dilation that could be considered clinically 
significant. Careful surveillance for migration is an essential component of 
long-term follow-up after EVAR.

OBJECTIVE: Eversion carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been touted as superior to 
standard CEA with patch closure because of allegedly lower restenosis rates and 
greater technical ease of performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
the early experience of one vascular surgeon beginning to use this technique.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study in an academic vascular surgical 
practice. The first 100 patients undergoing CEA via the eversion technique were 
compared with 100 contemporaneous patients who had standard CEA with patch 
closure. Residual (first examination within 3 months) or recurrent postoperative 
duplex scan stenosis, perioperative neurologic deficit, and mortality were 
analyzed by cumulative sum failure and Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.
RESULTS: Operative indications were not significantly different between eversion 
and standard CEA patients (63% vs 60% asymptomatic, 10% vs 7% stroke, 4% vs 5% 
amaurosis, and 23% vs 28% transient ischemia). Intraoperative shunting was more 
commonly used during eversion CEA (87% vs 59%; P < .01). Perioperative 
neurologic deficits included amaurosis (n = 1) after eversion CEA and transient 
cerebral ischemia (n = 1) and retinal infarction (n = 1) after standard CEA, 
with one cardiac death each. By 36 months, one other patient in each group had 
experienced a transient ischemic event, but there were no strokes. Four carotids 
occluded within 36 months of eversion CEA, compared with one occlusion after 
standard CEA (not significant). Patients undergoing eversion CEA showed no 
difference in critical (>80%) residual or recurrent stenosis rates. However, 
after eversion CEA, a greater degree of greater than 50% recurrent stenosis was 
observed at 36 months (38% vs 6%; P < .001) despite similar residual stenosis 
rates. Cumulative sum failure analysis showed no plateau among patients 
undergoing eversion CEA, thus indicating the absence of a learning curve, at 
least within the first 100 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite enthusiasm by advocates for eversion CEA, the recurrent 
greater than 50% stenosis rate remained high for the first 100 patients who 
underwent this technique, with no evidence of a learning curve. This observation 
implies that vascular surgeons considering adoption of this technique should 
monitor their own early results carefully.

c-Fos degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway in osteoclast 
progenitors.

c-Fos is an immediate early gene type proto-oncogene that belongs to the AP 
(activator protein)-1 transcription factor family. Gene knockout experiments 
have demonstrated that, among the Fos family, only c-Fos is indispensable for 
osteoclast differentiation but that c-Fos can be substituted for by other Fos 
family members including FosB/DeltaFosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2, in most other tissues 
and cells. To further understand a unique role of c-Fos in osteoclastogenesis, 
we investigated the temporal profile and regulatory mode of expression of c-Fos 
during the course of osteoclast differentiation. The results indicated that 
c-Fos protein gradually increased in preosteoclasts during differentiation to a 
greater extent than that of mRNA induction. We then determined the proteolytic 
pathway of c-Fos conferring unstable nature on c-Fos protein in a 
preosteoclastic cell line, RAW264.7. Proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and 
Z-LLF caused a rapid increase in c-Fos protein expression in these cells within 
several hours, but other inhibitors of cysteine protease (E-64), lysosome 
(chloroquine) and calpain (ALLM) did not. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitors 
caused an extensive accumulation of ubiquitinated c-Fos protein and an 
approximately three-fold extension of the c-Fos protein half-life. We therefore 
conclude that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major proteolytic pathway 
conferring instability on c-Fos protein in preosteoclasts. Our results further 
imply that c-Fos stabilization due to dynamic changes in the 
ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation may be involved in the accumulation 
of c-Fos protein in differentiating preosteoclasts.

Research in spirituality, religion and aging.

Moberg DO(1).

Author information:

Research on the concept of "spirituality" demonstrates its overlap with 
"religion," so for many purposes they need to be considered together as 
"spirituality/religion." Investigations of age differences point to the 
likelihood that spirituality tends to increase during later adulthood. It has 
important positive relationships with various measures of life satisfaction, 
psychosocial well-being, and both physical and mental health. It benefits 
therapy for recovery from illness and is a source of meaning and purpose in 
life. Spiritual interventions help to relieve psychological distress and death 
anxiety, as well as the stresses of caregiving. Because of its therapeutic 
value, prayer is an important resource for coping with problems experienced 
during the life course. The Spiritual Well-Being Scale and many other 
instruments have been developed to measure spirituality and related concepts. As 
in all other domains of research on people, they all have limits and must be 
applied with caution for both technical and ethical reasons. Nevertheless, 
applications of the research findings, which overwhelmingly demonstrate the 
importance of spirituality to human well-being, already are improving the 
effectiveness of clinical work and social services in all of the health and 
human service professions. As scientific knowledge of spirituality expands, so 
does awareness of the need for further research, including the refinement of 
methodological procedures, expansion to new topics, and extension to 
international cultures and diverse religions. The outlook for research on 
spirituality and the consequent practical applications to benefit humanity is 
very promising.

One of the best examples of a natural behavioral syndrome is the pollen-hoarding 
syndrome in honeybees that ties together multiple behavioral phenotypes, ranging 
from foraging behavior to behavioral ontogeny and learning performance. A 
central behavioral factor is the bees' responsiveness to sucrose, measured as 
their proboscis extension reflex. This study examines the genetics of this trait 
in diploid worker and haploid male honeybees (drones) to learn more about the 
genetic architecture of the overall behavioral syndrome, using original strains 
selected for pollen-hoarding behavior. We show that a significant proportion of 
the phenotypic variability is determined by genotype in males and workers. 
Second, our data present overwhelming evidence for pleiotropic effects of 
previously identified quantitative trait loci for foraging behavior (pln-QTL) 
and epistatic interactions among them. Furthermore, we report on three genomic 
QTL scans (two reciprocal worker backcrosses and one drone hybrid population) 
derived from our selection strains. We present at least one significant and two 
putative new QTL directly affecting the sucrose response of honeybees. Thus, 
this study demonstrates the modular genetic architecture of behavioral syndromes 
in general, and elucidates the genetic architecture of the pollen-hoarding 
behavioral syndrome in particular. Understanding this behavioral syndrome is 
important for understanding the division of labor in social insects and social 
evolution itself.

BACKGROUND: Biological significance of prostate latent cancers as early phase of 
clinical cancers has been controversial. The characterization of the latent 
cancer may be important to investigate differences between latent and clinical 
prostate cancers.
METHODS: Latent cancers of the prostate, discovered at autopsy in men with no 
prior treatment for prostate disease and clinical prostate cancers, were 
compared for cell proliferation activities with parameters such as markers 
Ag-nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR), topoisomerase II-alpha, and Ki-67. We 
also immunohistochemically studied alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) 
expression that was recently identified as a possible positive marker of the 
prostate cancers. We analyzed 50 latent cancers and 50 clinical cancers, and 
samples were analyzed with Gleason grades or tumor volume.
RESULTS: In the latent cancers, Gleason grades 1-4 were observed, but in the 
clinical cancers Gleason grades 2-5 were recognized. Cell proliferation 
activities were significantly lower in the latent cancers in Gleason grade 3, 
and similar results were obtained but without statistical significance in 
Gleason grades 2 and 4. When analysis was performed according to the tumor size, 
it was shown that the growth activities of the tumor of the clinical cancer were 
higher than the latent cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that proliferation activities of the latent 
cancers were lower than the clinical cancers at the same Gleason grades. The 
data also suggest that latent cancers are just of preclinical stage and there is 
a possibility to progress to clinical ones by changing life style and longer 
life expectancy.

Dementia in india--a critical appraisal.

Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by acquired loss of cognitive and 
emotional abilities that interfere with activities of daily living. It is a 
disease of the older adults. The overall prevalence of dementia in developed 
countries has been reported to be between 5% and 10% after 60 or 65 years and 
older. India is the second largest populous country. The prevalence doubles with 
every five-year increase in age. Looking at some studies, it appears that the 
prevalence of dementia in India is lower as compared to developed countries and 
even from other developing countries. The probable reasons for lower prevalence 
in India are enumerated as: False negatives, low life expectancy, shorter 
survival and duration of disease, low age-specific incidence. Risk factors 
include greater age, female sex, less education, positive family history, Down's 
syndrome, stroke and its risk factors, head trauma with loss of conscionsness 
and thyroid diseases. Protective factors include higher education, APOE2 gene, 
intake of antioxidant substances, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, oestrogen 
supplements in women and also cigarette smoking (controversial). Alzheimer's 
disease has been found to be commonest cause of dementia. Patients of dementia 
require proper evaluation and management requires a multidisciplinary approach. 
The government and the social organisations should come forward and only a 
concerted effort of all people in every sphere of life will enable to tackle the 
new menace of this country.
