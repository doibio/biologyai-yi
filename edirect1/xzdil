BACKGROUND: Team-based and timely integrated palliative care is a gold standard 
of care in oncology, but issues concerning its optimal organization remain. 
Palliative Care in Day-Hospital (PCDH) could be one of the most efficient 
service model of palliative care to deliver interdisciplinary and 
multidimensional care addressing the complex supportive care needs of patients 
with advanced cancer. We hypothesize that, compared to conventional outpatient 
palliative care, PCDH allows the clinical benefits of palliative care to be 
enhanced.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multicentre parallel group trial with stratified 
randomization. Patient management in PCDH will be compared to conventional 
outpatient palliative care. The inclusion criteria are advanced cancer patients 
referred to a palliative care team with an estimated life expectancy of more 
than 2 months and less than 1 year. The primary endpoint is health-related 
quality of life with deterioration-free survival based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 
questionnaire. The secondary objectives are the following: increase in patient 
satisfaction with care using the EORTC PATSAT-C33 and OUT-PATSAT7 
questionnaires, better understanding of the prognosis using the PTPQ 
questionnaire and advance care planning; decrease in the need for supportive 
care among relatives using the SCNS-P&C-F questionnaire, and reduction in 
end-of-life care aggressiveness. Patients will complete one to five 
questionnaires on a tablet before each monthly visit over 6 months and will be 
followed for 1 year. A qualitative study will take place, aiming to understand 
the specificity of palliative care management in PCDH. Cost-effectiveness, 
cost-utility and, an additional economic evaluation based on capability approach 
will be conducted from a societal point of view.
DISCUSSION: The first strength of this study is that it combines the main 
relevant outcomes assessing integrated palliative care; patient quality of life 
and satisfaction; discussion of the prognosis and advance care planning, family 
well-being and end-of-life care aggressiveness. The second strength of the study 
is that it is a mixed-method study associating a qualitative analysis of the 
specificity of PCDH organization, with a medical-economic study to analyse the 
cost of care.

countries.

With increasing life-expectancy and changing demographics, non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (AF) is currently the most common indication for long-term oral 
anticoagulation (OAC) in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Due to a 
decreasing trend in the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD), valve 
disease as a primary cause of AF now constitutes a small fraction of all people 
with AF. Moreover, emerging data also indicate that, patients with significant 
valve disease and AF may have a risk of stroke similar to, if not lower than, 
those with non-valvular AF. Previous trials of anticoagulation for AF excluded 
people from LMICs partly because valvular AF constituted a large proportion of 
those with AF, and it was thought to confer a prohibitively high risk of stroke. 
Trialists should therefore be less reluctant to include patients with AF from 
LMICs in general, and those with valve disease in particular, in future trials 
of anticoagulation. The quality of vitamin K antagonist based oral 
anticoagulation remains poor in LMICs to a large extent because of poor 
monitoring. The widespread use of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) presents 
a practical approach to improve anticoagulation quality. Randomised trials of 
DOACs in valvular AF are particularlycriticalto bridge the knowledge gap in this 
area. Discussions regarding oral anticoagulation (OAC) use in low and middle 
income countries (LMICs) have historicallybeendominated by severallong-held 
beliefs. The first is that the quality of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) based 
anticoagulation is poor in these countries. The veracity of this assumption is 
supported by a large number of studies documenting both lower prescription of 
OACs, and a lower proportion of international normalised ratio (INR) values in 
the therapeutic range.1The second is that a large proportion of patients 
receiving OAC in LMICs have atrial fibrillation (AF) related to valvular heart 
disease, and rheumatic mitral stenosis in particular. This assumption, perhaps 
valid several decades ago, is no longer supported by the data. Finally, patients 
with valvular heart disease and AF (specifically those with moderate or severe 
valve lesions), are thought to be at prohibitively high thromboembolic risk. 2 
However, recent evidence suggests that this risk may have been 
overestimated.34Nevertheless, the aforementioned assumptions continue to 
contribute to the underrepresentation of patients from LMICs in clinical trials 
of oral anticoagulation. Knowledge of the characteristics of contemporary 
patients in LMICs who are eligible for long-term OAC, estimates of their stroke 
risk, and a better understanding of the drivers of poor anticoagulation quality, 
may help guide research and clinical practice. In this review, we seek to 
provide an evidence-based perspective on OAC use in patients with AF living in 
LMICs and China.

Conflict of interest statement: Declaration of competing interest None of the 
authors report any conflicts of interest. With increasing life-expectancy, the 
number of persons living with atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutterin the LMICs 
and China shows a steady increase. In 2019, there are more people living with AF 
in India and China alone when compared to all the high income countries put 
together (Panel A) The proportional increase in the number of people with 
rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is smaller than the increase in AF(Panel B) Note 
that these estimates are for all patients with a diagnosis of RHD including 
those with mild disease detected by screening. Only a fraction of patients with 
RHD develop AF. Even among patients with RHD and significant valve disease 
requiring hospital care, the prevalence of AF is about 22%.(7) Data are from the

The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) has transformed HIV infection into a chronic 
disease. However, patients may be at risk of accelerated aging and the 
accumulation of cellular damage, which may trigger the development of cancer. We 
evaluated genomic instability in HIV-positive individuals with different viral 
loads receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and in HIV ART-naïve individuals. 
We included 67 participants divided into four groups: group 1 (n = 24) HIV 
patients receiving reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/ emtricitabine/ 
efavirenz and abacavir/ lamivudine/ efavirenz), group 2 (n = 22) HIV patients 
receiving protease inhibitors combined with other antiretroviral drugs 
(tenofovir/ emtricitabine with ritonavir/ atazanavir or lopinavir/ ritonavir, 
and darunavir/ ritonavir/ raltegravir), group 3 (n = 13) HIV ART-naïve patients, 
and group 4 (n = 8) healthy individuals (controls). Nuclear abnormalities in 
buccal mucosal samples (micronuclei, binucleated cells, nuclear buds, 
karyorrhexis, karyolysis, and pyknosis) were quantified. Simultaneously, blood 
samples were taken to quantify CD4+, CD8+, and HIV viral load. There was a 
significant age difference between HIV ART-naïve patients and receiving ART 
groups. Infection time was longer in HIV patients with ART than in ART-naïve 
patients. There were no differences in sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, or 
number of micronucleated cells between the study groups. We found higher 
frequencies of binucleated cells and nuclear buds in HIV patients, HIV 
ART-naïve, and HIV ART patients compared to the control group. We found a 
positive correlation between nuclear buds and CD4/CD8 ratio in the HIV ART-naïve 
group. In conclusion, PLWH showed increased genomic instability. The CD4/CD8 
ratio affects the numbers of nuclear buds and binucleated cells. These findings 
are pertinent to mechanisms of damage and possible strategies to mitigate 
carcinogenesis in PLWH.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the physicochemical and mechanical properties of a 
milled fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) for implant-supported fixed dental 
prostheses (FDPs).
METHODS: For FRC characterization, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transformed infrared 
spectrometry, simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning 
calorimetry were performed. For fatigue testing, 3-unit FRC frameworks were 
fabricated with conventional (9 mm2 connector area) and modified designs (12 mm2 
connector area and 2.5 mm-height lingual extension). A hybrid resin composite 
was veneered onto the frameworks. FDPs were subjected to step-stress 
accelerated-life fatigue testing until fracture or suspension. Use level 
probability Weibull curves at 300 N were plotted and the reliability for 100,000 
cycles at 300, 600 and 800 N was calculated. Fractographic analysis was 
performed by stereomicroscope and SEM.
RESULTS: The FRC consisted of an epoxy resin (∼25%) matrix reinforced with 
inorganic particles and glass fibers (∼75%). Multi-layer continuous 
regular-geometry fibers were densely arranged in a parallel and bidirectional 
fashion in the resin matrix. Fatigue analysis demonstrated high probability of 
survival (99%) for FDPs at 300 N, irrespective of framework design. Conventional 
FDPs showed a progressive decrease in the reliability at 600 (84%) and 800 N 
(19%), whereas modified FDPs reliability significantly reduced only at 800 N 
(75%). The chief failure modes for FRC FDPs were cohesive fracture of the 
veneering composite on lower loads and adhesive fracture of the veneering 
composite at higher loads.
SIGNIFICANCE: Milled epoxy resin matrix reinforced with glass fibers composite 
resulted in high probability of survival in the implant-supported prosthesis 
scenario.

BACKGROUND: Better insights into the natural course of cystic fibrosis (CF) have 
led to treatment approaches that have improved pulmonary health and increased 
the life expectancy of affected individuals. This study evaluated how the 
combination of modified demographics and changes in CF management impacted 
resource consumption and the cost of care.
METHODS: Medical records of CF patients from 2006 to 2016 in the French CF 
Registry were linked to their corresponding claims data (SNDS). Medications, 
medical visits, procedures, hospitalisations, and indirect costs were annualized 
by calendar year from 2006 to 2017.
RESULTS: Of the 7,671 patients included in the French CF Registry, 6,187 
patients (80.7%) were linked to the SNDS (51.9% male, mean age = 24.7 years). 
The average cost per patient was €14,174 in 2006, €21,920 in 2011 and €44,585 in 
2017. Costs associated with hospital stays increased from €3,843 per patient in 
2006 to €6,741 in 2017. In 2017, the mean cost per CF patient was allocated as 
follows: 72% for medications (of which 51% for modulator therapies), 15% for 
hospital stays, 7% for medical visits, 3% for indirect costs, 2% for medical 
devices, 1% for outpatient medical procedures.
CONCLUSION: There was a strong increase in the mean annual cost per CF patient 
between 2006 and 2017, mostly due to the cost of therapy after the introduction 
of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. The 
combination of an increase in the number of CF patients - particularly adult 
patients - and an increase in the annual cost per patient led to a substantial 
increase in the total cost of CF disease care for the health systems.

As plastic pollution is becoming an increasing worldwide problem, a variety of 
different techniques for the detection and in-depth characterization of 
plastics, including spectroscopy and chromatography methods, were introduced to 
the public. Recently we presented fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy 
(FLIM) a new approach for the identification and characterization of 
microplastics using their fluorescence lifetime (τ) for differentiation. A very 
powerful extension of the recently established FLIM could be phasor analysis, 
which allows data representation in an interactive 2D graphical phasor plot 
thereby enabling a global view of the fluorescence decay in each pixel of the 
measured image. Microplastic particles generated from six different types of 
plastics were subjected to excitation wavelengths of 440 nm, upon which specific 
fluorescence lifetimes as well as the photon yield were determined using FLIM 
and phasor analysis. We could show that phasor analysis for FLIM with a laser 
pulse repetition frequency of 40 MHz was able to generate specific locations in 
the phasor plot for the plastics for fast differentiation, e.g. resulting in 
well-defined phasor plot positions for ABS at 3.019 ns, PPE at 6.239 ns, PET 
bottle from Germany at 2.703 ns and PET bottle from USA at 2.711 ns. Phasor 
analysis for FLIM proves to be a fast, label-free, and sensitive method for the 
identification and differentiation of plastics also with the aid of 
visualization variation enabling techniques such as heat treatment of plastics.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding trends in the annual incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) 
cancer globally is important to enable appropriate targeting of resources for 
prevention, clinical practice improvement, and research. The aim of this study 
was to determine the global, regional, and national burdens of TBL cancer in 204 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 by age, sex, and sociodemographic 
index.
METHODS: Estimates were produced through various data inputs including the 
following: cancer registries (nsite-years = 5318), vital registration 
(nsite-years = 22,553), vital registration-sample (nsite-years = 825), and 
verbal autopsies (nsite-years = 516). Annual incidence, mortality, and DALYs 
were estimated and presented as counts and age-standardized rates per 100,000 
population.
RESULTS: There were 2.3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2.1-2.5) 
incident cases of TBL cancer, with an age-standardized annual incidence rate of 
27.7 (95% UI: 25.3-30), which decreased by 2.6% (95% UI: -12.4 to 6.5) between 
1990 and 2019. TBL cancer was responsible for 2 million (95% UI: 1.9-2.2) deaths 
globally with an age-standardized death rate of 25.2 (95% UI: 23.2-27), a 
decrease of 7.8% (95% UI: -15.9 to 0.2) between 1990 and 2019. Moreover, TBL 
accounted for 45.9 million (95% UI: 42.3-49.3) DALYs at the global level, with 
an age-standardized rate of 551.6 (95% UI: 509-593.1) DALYs per 100,000 
population. The standardized DALY rate declined by 16.2% (95% UI: -24 to -8.2) 
from 1990 to 2019. Greenland (77.7 [95% UI: 64.4-90.6]), Monaco (75.6 [95% UI: 
61.4-90.8]), and Montenegro (56.7 [95% UI: 46.5-68.9]) had the three highest 
age-standardized annual incidence rates. The aforementioned three countries also 
had the three highest age-standardized death and DALY rates of TBL cancer. 
Honduras (68% [95% UI: 14.5-137.7]), Cabo Verde (62.2% [95% UI: 24.1-101.3]), 
and Monaco (58.2% [95% UI: 19.2-109.7]) had the largest increase in 
age-standardized annual incidence rates for TBL cancer during 1990 to 2019. The 
largest increases were found in age-standardized death rates of TBL cancer in 
Honduras (67.1% [95% UI: 14.7-133.1]), Cabo Verde (64.4% [95% UI: 25-103.4]), 
and Mozambique (49.9% [95% UI: 7.9 -101.3]). Age-standardized annual incidence 
and death rates were higher in male than female individuals and increased with 
population aging. There were nonlinear but generally positive associations 
between age-standardized DALY rates with corresponding sociodemographic index of 
countries. Globally, smoking (62.4%), ambient particulate matter (15.3%), and 
high fasting plasma glucose (9.9%) had the top three highest percent of 
attributable DALYs owing to TBL cancer in 2019 for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a decline in burden globally but with some 
countries having an increase. These results are crucial to set priorities for 
prevention and treatment of TBL cancer and would be beneficial for policymakers, 
government officials, clinicians, and researchers.

ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have dramatically improved the outcome for 
CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) patients. When TKI therapy is addressed 
appropriately, it can lead to an optimal molecular response in the majority of 
CML patients and a life expectancy that approaches that of the general 
population. However, lifelong TKI therapy may have consequences, including 
chronic, mostly low-grade, adverse events that can substantially impact 
patients' quality of life, adherence to therapy and, consequently, success of 
treatment. In the last few years, several groups have demonstrated that 
approximately 50% of chronic phase CML patients (CP-CML) who have achieved a 
stable deep molecular response (DMR) can stop therapy without suffering 
molecular relapse. Nowadays, treatment-free remission (TFR) has a significant 
role in the management of CML and should be considered in selected motivated 
patients that fulfill well-defined requirements to maximize the probability of 
successful discontinuation of TKI therapy.

Using a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of 
community-dwelling older osteoporotic Japanese women with prior vertebral 
fracture over a lifetime horizon, we found that daily subcutaneous teriparatide 
for 2 years followed by weekly oral alendronate for 8 years was not 
cost-effective compared with alendronate monotherapy for 10 years.
PURPOSE: Teriparatide has proven efficacy in reducing osteoporotic fractures, 
but with substantial cost. We examined the cost-effectiveness of sequential 
teriparatide/alendronate (i.e., daily subcutaneous teriparatide for 2 years 
followed by weekly oral alendronate for 8 years) compared with alendronate 
monotherapy for 10 years among community-dwelling older osteoporotic women with 
prior clinical or morphometric vertebral fracture in Japan.
METHODS: Using a previously validated and updated Markov microsimulation model, 
we obtained incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (Japanese yen [¥] (or US 
dollars [$]) per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) from the perspective of a 
single payer responsible for both public healthcare and long-term care. We 
assumed a lifetime horizon with a willingness-to-pay of ¥5million (or $47,500) 
per QALY in the base case. We modeled the cost of biosimilar teriparatide, which 
has been available since November 2019 in Japan, assuming the efficacy was the 
same as that of the brand version.
RESULTS: In the base case, sequential teriparatide/alendronate was not 
cost-effective compared with alendronate monotherapy. In deterministic 
sensitivity analyses, sequential teriparatide/alendronate would become 
cost-effective with 85%, 50%, and 15% price discounts to teriparatide at ages 
70, 75, and 80, respectively, compared to the current biosimilar cost. 
Otherwise, results were especially sensitive to changes that affected efficacy 
of teriparatide or alendronate. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the 
probabilities of sequential teriparatide/alendronate being cost-effective were 
0%, 1%, and 37% at ages 70, 75, and 80, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk osteoporotic women in Japan, sequential 
teriparatide/alendronate was not cost-effective compared with alendronate 
monotherapy, even with the availability of biosimilar teriparatide.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses embedded within randomized trials allow 
for evaluation of value alongside conventional efficacy outcomes; however, 
collection of resource utilization data can require considerable trial 
resources.
METHODS: We re-analyzed the results from four phase III Canadian Cancer Trials 
Group trials that embedded cost-effectiveness analyses to determine the impact 
of minimizing potential cost categories on the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. For each trial, we disaggregated total costs into component incremental 
cost categories and recalculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using (1) 
only the top 3 cost categories, (2) the top 5 cost categories, and (3) all cost 
components. Using individual trial-level data, confidence intervals for each 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio simulation were generated by bootstrapping 
and descriptively presented with the original confidence intervals (and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) from the publications.
RESULTS: Drug acquisition costs represented the highest incremental cost 
category in three trials, while hospitalization costs represented the other 
consistent cost driver and the top incremental cost category in the fourth 
trial. Recalculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on fewer cost 
components (top 3 and top 5) did not differ meaningfully from the original 
published results. Based on conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds 
(US$50,000-US$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year), none of the re-analyses 
would have changed the original perception of whether the experimental therapies 
were considered cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the collection of resource utilization 
data within cancer trials could be narrowed. Omission of certain cost categories 
that have minimal impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, such as 
routine laboratory investigations, could reduce the costs and undue burden 
associated with the collection of data required for cancer trial 
cost-effectiveness analyses.

Aluminum (Al) precipitates in acidic soils having a pH < 5.5, in the form of 
conjugated organic and inorganic ions. Al-containing minerals solubilized in the 
soil solution cause several negative impacts in plants when taken up along with 
other nutrients. Moreover, a micromolar concentration of Al present in the soil 
is enough to induce several irreversible toxicity symptoms such as the rapid and 
transient over-generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide 
anion (O2•-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (•OH), resulting in 
oxidative bursts. In addition, significant reductions in water and nutrient 
uptake occur which imposes severe stress in the plants. However, some plants 
have developed Al-tolerance by stimulating the secretion of organic acids like 
citrate, malate, and oxalate, from plant roots. Genes responsible for encoding 
such organic acids, play a critical role in Al tolerance. Several transporters 
involved in Al resistance mechanisms are members of the Aluminum-activated 
Malate Transporter (ALMT), Multidrug and Toxic compound Extrusion (MATE), 
ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC), Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 
(Nramp), and aquaporin gene families. Therefore, in the present review, the 
discussion of the global extension and probable cause of Al in the environment 
and mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants are followed by detailed emphasis on 
tolerance mechanisms. We have also identified and categorized the important 
transporters that secrete organic acids and outlined their role in Al stress 
tolerance mechanisms in crop plants. The information provided here will be 
helpful for efficient exploration of the available knowledge to develop Al 
tolerant crop varieties.

Introduction: Migraine is currently listed as the second cause of 'years lived 
with disability' and the sixth cause of global disability. Despite the burden 
associated to the disease, availability of specific drugs is still limited.Areas 
covered: The authors have evaluated lasmiditan, the first 'ditan' approved by 
the Food and Drugs Administration in 2019, from a global perspective: basic 
chemistry, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, efficacy in migraine as 
a 5-HT1F receptor selective agonist, tolerability and clinical safety, and 
impact on migraine-related disability. Our evaluation considered original papers 
and review articles published from 2010 to 2020.Expert opinion: Available data 
point to the efficacy of lasmiditan in reducing migraine pain and the most 
bothersome symptoms within 2 hours from oral administration. Moreover, 
lasmiditan has a positive effect on migraine-related disability. Its side 
effects mostly reflect an involvement of the central nervous system or the 
vestibular system, while cardiovascular side effects are rare and 
mild.Lasmiditan can be safely prescribed in patients who have failed non-steroid 
anti-inflammatory drugs or triptans or with cardiovascular risk factors. Caution 
is advised in frequent users, due to lack of reliable data on its abuse 
potential. Further data are necessary to determine the usability of lasmiditan 
in particular populations, e.g. children and adolescents, pregnancy.

AIMS: There is limited published evidence for the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments for unresectable or metastatic endometrial cancer (mEC). The 
objective of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab 
versus chemotherapy for previously treated unresectable or mEC, in women whose 
tumors have deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability 
(MSI-H). The analysis was carried out from a US healthcare payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model comprising three 
health states (progression-free, progressed disease and death) was constructed. 
Chemotherapy was represented by single-agent paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Overall 
survival, progression-free survival and time on treatment data for pembrolizumab 
were obtained from a Phase II clinical study that included women with previously 
treated dMMR/MSI-H unresectable or mEC (KEYNOTE-158, NCT02628067). Survival data 
for chemotherapy were obtained from a published Phase III study for previously 
treated advanced endometrial cancer. Costs included were drug acquisition and 
administration, health-state, end-of-life, and adverse event management. Costs 
were presented in 2019 US$. Outcomes were calculated as quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), using EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE-158. Model results were tested 
extensively in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Results demonstrated that pembrolizumab is a highly cost-effective 
treatment option when compared with chemotherapy, with estimated deterministic 
and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $58,165 and 
$57,668 per QALY gained, respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a large 
QALY and life-year gain per person versus chemotherapy over the model time 
horizon (deterministic 4.68 life year gain, 3.80 QALYs), with the majority of 
QALYs accrued in the progression-free health state.
LIMITATIONS: The key limitation of the analysis was the lack of comparative 
effectiveness data for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is a highly cost-effective treatment option when 
compared with chemotherapy for women with previously treated dMMR/MSI-H 
unresectable or mEC. Results were robust to the changes in parameters and 
assumptions explored.

As one of the crucial factors associated with human life span and cancer 
progression, telomerase is regarded as an emerging biomarker for cancer 
diagnosis. Therefore, a facile, rapid and sensitive approach for telomerase 
activity detection with point-of-care (POC) diagnosis potential is in great 
demands. Herein, an all-in-one telomerase activity detection assay was 
established based on the telomere synthesis activated CRISPR-Cas12a system. A 
telomerase extension reaction generated telomere repeats sequences (TTAGGG)n, 
which was recognized by a customized CRISPR-guided RNA (crRNA) simultaneously, 
and finally activated a typical trans-cleavage based CRISPR-Cas12a detection 
assay. With the inherent sensitivity of CRISPR-Cas12a, this approach achieved a 
great linear regression ranging from 100 to 2000 HeLa cells and a limitation of 
detection down to 26 HeLa cells. Moreover, by using the proposed method, 
telomerase can be detected in one pot under isothermal condition (37 °C) by a 
simple and fast workflow (one step within 1 h). Due to its excellent 
performance, this all-in-one method shows great potential in POC detection of 
the telomerase activity.

BACKGROUND: Nurses are the key professionals in the introduction, 
implementation, and use of technology in clinical practice. A lack of technical 
expertise and technological understanding poses a challenge to the quality of 
health services and possibly to the safety, dignity, and quality of life of 
patients. Therefore, possessing technological literacy upon completing nursing 
baccalaureate studies is essential. However, no previous scoping review has 
mapped the existing studies of technological literacy in nursing education.
OBJECTIVES: To map and assess the published studies on technological literacy in 
nursing education and to identify how educational institutions operationalize, 
teach, measure, and maintain students' technological literacy throughout their 
educational programs.
DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of 
Arksey and O'Malley. The reporting was guided by the PRISMA extension for 
Scoping Reviews.
METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
ERIC, and CINAHL was performed for studies published from January 2008 through 
March 2020. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. 
The reference lists of the included studies were also examined.
RESULTS: The review included 28 papers from 27 studies. Three thematic groupings 
with their respective subgroups were identified among the included papers: 1) 
the acquisition (simulated electronic documentation, diversified learning 
methods, and evaluation learning focus), 2) the measurement (digital/computer 
literacy/competence, nursing informatics competence, technology acceptance, and 
students' interests and preferences in technology), and 3) the maintenance 
(follow-up evaluation) of technological knowledge and skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Pedagogical models designed to teach an entire process for the 
acquisition, measurement, and maintenance of technological literacy are lacking. 
Studies are needed that bring technological competencies to a higher level, 
including problem-solving and critical thinking. Educators' competencies should 
be enhanced. Educational institutions need to ensure the readiness of future 
nurses for a technology-enriched environment by providing the necessary 
knowledge in technological literacy. "TWEETABLE ABSTRACT": Due to the importance 
of technological literacy to the nursing profession, educational institutions 
must ensure that it is taught to nursing students.

BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea (ACCT) is a rare cancer; 
ACCT with thyroid invasion is particularly rare. We first suspected anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) but diagnosed ACC after performing fine-needle 
aspiration cytology (FNAC). Tracheal origin was confirmed postoperatively.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 77-year-old woman presented to our hospital with acute 
inspiratory dyspnea requiring emergency tracheotomy. Physical examination 
revealed swelling of the right anterior neck and a hard, immobile mass. Computed 
tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) showed tumor extension to the right 
thyroid lobe and between the first and third tracheal rings, which caused severe 
stenosis of the lumen. We performed FNAC. Clinical findings were highly 
suggestive of ACCT with thyroid invasion. She underwent total laryngectomy, 
cervical esophagectomy, and thyroidectomy with bilateral selective neck 
dissection at another hospital. The tumor was located in the right posterior 
wall of the trachea and extended into the right thyroid gland. Pathological 
examination showed infiltrative carcinomatous proliferation with tubular and 
cribriform patterns. The tumor was classified as pT4N1. A definite diagnosis was 
made after histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed ACCT. 
The tumor was positive for FABP7, a putative prognostic marker of ACC, and 
metastasized to the lungs 3 years after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: ACCT with thyroid invasion is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm. 
FNAC was useful for differentiating ACCT from other diagnoses and enabled 
appropriate surgical treatment.

BACKGROUND: Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal disorder 
associated with intellectual disability. Besides clinical management, additional 
support to cope with the demands of life is also necessary. These parents are 
frequently unstable and forego their Quality of Life (QoL), suffer additional 
economic difficulties, ill health and have lower well-being than families 
without disabilities. Hence, the study intends to evaluate the Health-Related 
QoL (HR-QoL) and coping strategies among families of DS children.
METHODS: This explorative, cross-sectional study was conducted among 
parents/caregivers of DS children (n = 51). Socio-demographic details, HR-QoL, 
coping strategies and perspectives on having a child with disability were 
obtained through a standard questionnaire.
RESULTS: Most DS children were upper and upper-middle class of urban background.
