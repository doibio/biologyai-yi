BACKGROUND: Current therapies for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas do not improve 
the life expectancy of patients.
METHODS: In a non-randomized pilot trail we tested whether a local therapy based 
upon an adenoviral gene transfer of wild type p53 in combination with 
gemcitabine administration would be safe in patients with liver metastases due 
to pancreatic carcinoma. We report on the clinical course of three patients with 
respect to safety, tolerability and tumor response.
RESULTS: Transient grade III toxicities occurred with fever, leucopenia, 
elevation of AP, ALT, AST, GGT, while grade IV toxicity occurred for bilirubin 
only. Laboratory tests suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation in all 
three patients, but fine needle biopsies of liver did not show any histological 
evidence of thrombus or clot formation. Progression of liver metastases was 
documented in one and stable disease in another patient two months after 
treatment. However, a major improvement with regression of the indexed lesion by 
80% occurred in a third patient after a single administration of 7.5 x 10(12) 
viral particles, and time to progression was extended to six months.
CONCLUSION: The combination therapy of viral gene transfer and chemotherapy 
temporarily controls and diminishes tumor burden. Improvement of the toxicity 
profile is necessary. Further trials are warranted to improve treatment and life 
expectancy of patients suffering from fatal diseases such as pancreatic 
carcinoma.

Brugada syndrome is characterized by an ST-segment elevation in the right 
precordial ECG leads and a high incidence of sudden death in patients with 
structurally normal hearts. Some trials have demonstrated that the 
cost-effectiveness of ICD implantation treatment in patients with structurally 
abnormal hearts is more favorable than that of control treatment. We used 
Treeage pro 2005 to estimate costs and survival among the Brugada syndrome 
patients who received either an ICD or were treated by control therapy of 
Ito-blocking properties (quinidine) or beta-blockers (propranolol). In 
conclusion, our analysis suggests that prophylactic implantation of an ICD has 
good cost-effectiveness in patients with Brugada syndrome who are at high risk 
of sudden death. ICD treatment has shown a cost-effectiveness ratio below $9591 
per QALY gained from trials of defibrillator vs beta-blockers for Unexplained 
Death in Thailand (DEBUT). The control therapy of quinidine may be a good choice 
for patients who are infants or living in developing countries.

[Life history characteristics of different genotype clones of Brachionus 
calyciflorus (Rotifera) population in Jinghu Lake].

By means of life table demographic approach, the life-table demographic 
parameters and the percentage of mictic females in the offspring of thirteen 
genetically different Brachionus calyciflorus clones were studied at 15 degrees 
C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The results showed that the 
responses of the generation time, average lifespan, life expectancy at hatching, 
intrinsic rate of population increase, net reproductive rate, and percentage of 
mictic females in the offspring of B. calyciflorus to increasing temperature 
differed with rotifer clones. Temperature, clone, and their interaction 
influenced the life-table demographic parameters and the percentage of mictic 
females in the offspring of B. calyciflorus significantly. The temporal 
heterogeneity of water temperature could be one of the reasons for the high 
genetic diversity in B. calyciflorus population in Jinghu Lake. Natural 
selection occurred in coexisting clones, and its function might be too weak or 
too time-limited to make the clonal exclusion occur. Genetic drift might play an 
important role in genotype frequency variation. The coexistence of different 
genotype clones of B. calyciflorus population is of significance for the 
existence of the population in water environment.

    Am J Manag Care. 2008 Jun;14(6):398-9.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to model the cost-effectiveness of 
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at frequencies of 1 or 3 times per day 
for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are treated with oral 
antidiabetic (OAD) medications within the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Based on a Kaiser Permanente study showing glycosylated hemoglobin 
(HbA1C) improvements related to SMBG frequency, a validated model was used to 
project 40-year clinical and economic outcomes for SMBG at 1 or 3 times per day 
vs no SMBG.
METHODS: Baseline mean HbA1C (8.6%), age, and sex of the simulated cohort came 
from the Kaiser analysis of new SMBG users of OAD agents for T2DM. Other cohort 
characteristics, transition probabilities, utilities, and direct costs (from a 
US public payer perspective) were derived from relevant literature. Outcomes 
were discounted at 3% per annum, with sensitivity analyses performed on discount 
rates and time horizons.
RESULTS: Compared with no SMBG, quality-adjusted life expectancy increased with 
SMBG frequency. Increases were 0.103 and 0.327 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for SMBG at 1 and 3 times per day, respectively. Corresponding 
incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs) were $7856 and $6601 per QALY gained. 
Results indicate that SMBG at both 1 and 3 times per day in this cohort of 
patients with T2DM taking OADs would represent good value for money in the 
United States, with ICERs being most sensitive to the time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer time horizons generally led to greater SMBG 
cost-effectiveness. The ICER for SMBG 3 times per day was $518 per QALY over a 
10-year time horizon, indicating very good value.

Water fluoridation as a marker for sociodental inequalities.

marilisagabardo@e-odonto.com

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between 
the Human Development Index at city level (HDI-M) in the state of Paraná, 
Brazil, and the length of time of population exposure to water fluoridation 
(time span) with the respective mean decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T) 
of schoolchildren in the state, looking at possible inequalities in these 
associations.
METHODS: The HDI-M of 323 cities in the state of Paraná, Brazil, was correlated 
to the duration of exposure to water fluoridation, calculated in number of days. 
Correlation between the HDI-M and the DMF-T indexes for 12-year-old children was 
also performed.
RESULTS: Correlations were statistically significant, showing that in the cities 
with a better HDI-M, water fluoridation had been implemented earlier (squared 
coefficient correlation of 22%). The fluoridation time span accounted for around 
11% of the variance in the DMF-T indexes of the cities. The correlation 
indicated that locations with a better HDI-M had a better DMF-T, owing to the 
probable mediating effect of receiving fluoridation earlier. Furthermore, the 
cost of water fluoridation to benefit the population that has access to this 
public health measure has been estimated at USD 0.15 per capita/year.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to conclude that this low-cost measure is able to 
improve oral health status in general. Nevertheless, in the Brazilian areas 
studied, fluoridation seems to reflect existing social development inequalities, 
as it was first made available in more socially developed areas, thus bearing an 
influence on their higher DMF-T performance to date.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, which starts with Magnetic Resonance-guided 
Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) as compared with current practice comprising 
uterine artery embolisation, myomectomy and hysterectomy.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model.
SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England and Wales.
POPULATION: Women for whom surgical treatment for uterine fibroids is being 
considered.
METHODS: The parameters of the Markov model of the treatment of uterine fibroids 
are drawn from a series of clinical studies of MRgFUS, and from the clinical 
effectiveness literature. Health-related quality of life is measured using the 
6D. Costs are estimated from the perspective of the NHS. The impact of 
uncertainty is examined using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness measured by cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The base-case results imply a cost saving and a small QALY gain per 
woman as a result of an MRgFUS treatment strategy. The cost per QALY gained is 
sensitive to cost of MRgFUS relative to other treatments, the age of the woman 
and the nonperfused volume relative to the total fibroids volume.
CONCLUSIONS: A treatment strategy for symptomatic uterine fibroids starting with 
MRgFUS is likely to be cost-effective.

University in Guarulhos, SP, Brazil. leandrodemelo@ig.com.br

AIM: The aim of this case report was to present the evaluation of the 
bone-to-implant contact in an implant retrieved from a subject with osteoporosis 
after six years of load.
BACKGROUND: Systemic conditions associated with osteoporosis have been 
postulated to contribute to the severity of alveolar bone loss. The increase in 
human life expectancy, the increased number of elderly subjects who are 
partially or totally edentulous, and the use of dental implants for oral 
habilitation in subjects with osteoporosis has raised several questions.
REPORT: A 68-year-old woman with postmenopausal osteoporosis received a 
prosthetic evaluation of an implant-supported restoration. Histologically, the 
peri-implant bone appeared healthy. The peri-implant bone appeared in close 
contact with the implant surface, whereas marrow spaces could be detected in 
other areas along with prominently stained cement lines. The mean of 
bone-to-implant contact was 62.51+1.96.
CONCLUSION: The results of the evaluation of the dental implant reported here 
suggest the presence of osteoporosis may not be a contra-indication for implant 
placement at least after osseointegration has already been established.

Brewer's/baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and preventive medicine: Part 
II.

Moyad MA(1).

USA.

Yeast is the term generally applied to a unicellular fungus, and there are 
hundreds of species now identified. One of the most notable and well-known 
species of yeast in health and wellness is known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
which is also known by its more common names, brewer's yeast or baker's yeast. 
Typically, brewer's yeast is used as a protein supplement, energy booster, 
immune enhancer, or other vehicle where other compounds can be inserted to 
create a commercialized health product. For example, one of the most notable 
positive findings was the encouraging results from a large randomized trial of 
adults recently vaccinated for seasonal influenza who also received an 
over-the-counter daily adjuvant modified brewer's yeast-based product (EpiCor) 
to prevent colds and flu symptoms. The modified yeast-based product 
significantly reduced the incidence and duration of this common condition. 
Yeast-based technology is also being used as a molecular mechanistic model of 
caloric restriction (CR) with the goal of improving the human life span. The 
current and potential impact of yeast-based technology in medicine is 
encouraging and should receive more attention, but the recent preliminary 
positive results of CR in humans may be in part due to what has been already 
learned from brewer's yeast.

A re-look at recent statistics on mortality in the context of HIV/AIDS with 
particular reference to South Africa.

Since the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s, various organisations and 
researchers have produced statistics on HIV/AIDS including HIV prevalence, 
incidence, number of AIDS cases, AIDS-related mortality as well as life 
expectancy at birth in the context of HIV/AIDS. Until recently HIV-prevalence 
statistics as well as models projecting the impact of HIV/AIDS utilised 
HIV-prevalence statistics based on women attending antenatal clinics as 
population-based prevalence statistics were non-existent. Among others, the 
extrapolation of HIV-prevalence statistics from surveillance sites to the 
general population has been questioned. Recent statistics on HIV-prevalence from 
population-based surveys strongly suggest that HIV-prevalence in many countries 
may not be as high as earlier estimated and projected. In addition, model 
estimates of HIV/AIDS-prevalence and impact on mortality often use conventional 
model life tables such as the Coale-Demeny Regional, UN, and Brass standard life 
tables, which in the case of South Africa give female life expectancy at birth 
plummeting from about 65 years in the mid-1990s to around 49-50 years in 2005. 
The standard life tables often employed in these estimates do not take account 
of the 'hump' in the mortality curve due to AIDS-related deaths as these 
standard mortality schedules were developed prior to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
Given this background, this paper provides a critical look at recent statistics 
on infant mortality rates and life expectancies at birth in the context of 
HIV/AIDS in parts of Southern and Eastern Africa with particular reference to 
South Africa.

Effects of developmental exposure to ethanol on Caenorhabditis elegans.

Davis JR(1), Li Y, Rankin CH.

Author information:

Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on physical 
development, reproduction, and life expectancy of Caenorhabditis elegans, a 
microscopic nematode worm. It has a small nervous system of 302 neurons and a 
short lifespan of 2 to 3 weeks.
METHODS: In this study, the worms were chronically exposed to varying 
concentrations of ethanol for different periods of their life: for their entire 
lifespan, during larval development only, and during adulthood only. In 
addition, the worms were exposed to ethanol acutely during different stages of 
embryonic development.
RESULTS: Chronic exposure to ethanol during larval development temporarily 
delayed physical growth, slowed development, delayed the onset of reproductive 
maturity, and decreased both reproductive fecundity and longevity. Chronic 
exposure to ethanol beginning when worms completed development and reached 
reproductive maturity resulted in reduced C. elegans body length, decreased 
reproductive fecundity, and life expectancy. Finally, acute embryonic exposure 
of C. elegans eggs to high concentrations of ethanol at different stages of 
development resulted in a lower probability of exposed eggs hatching into larval 
worms depending on when eggs were exposed during development. Furthermore, some 
of the worms that did hatch displayed distinct physical dysmorphologies as a 
consequence of acute ethanol exposure during embryonic development.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that exposing C. elegans to ethanol during 
critical development periods results in characteristic phenotypic outcomes. 
Thus, C. elegans offers a novel model for exploring the mechanisms by which 
ethanol exposure affects development.

Calculating life years from transplant (LYFT): methods for kidney and 
kidney-pancreas candidates.

The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Kidney Committee is 
considering a proposal for a new deceased donor kidney allocation system. Among 
the components under consideration is a strategy to rank candidates in part by 
the estimated incremental years of life that are expected to be achieved with a 
transplant from a specific available deceased donor, computed as the difference 
in expected median lifespan with that transplant compared with remaining on 
dialysis. This concept has been termed life years from transplant or LYFT. 
Median lifespans could be calculated, based on objective medical criteria, for 
each candidate when a deceased donor kidney becomes available, based on Cox 
regression models using current candidate and donor medical information. The 
distribution of the calculated LYFT scores for an average nonexpanded criteria 
donor kidney is similar across candidate sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status 
and, with the exception of diabetes, diagnosis. LYFT scores tend to be higher 
for younger candidates and lower for diabetics receiving a kidney-alone rather 
than a simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant. Prioritizing candidates with 
higher LYFT scores for each available kidney could substantially increase total 
years of life among both transplant candidates and recipients. LYFT is also a 
powerful metric for assessing trends in allocation outcomes and for comparing 
alternative allocation systems.

Total joint replacement in HIV positive patients.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, 
Marienburgstr. 2, 60528 Frankfurt/Main, Germany. b.habermann@friedrichsheim.de

BACKGROUND: Recent HIV therapies have improved life expectancy in HIV positive 
patients. For the purpose of the following retrospective investigation, we 
analyzed the results of total joint replacement in HIV positive patients. This 
study exemplifies orthopaedic treatment options and perioperative problems in 
HIV positive patients. Our population included a high proportion of hemophilic 
patients.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1988 and 2000, we performed 55 endoprosthetic 
procedures (20 total hip replacements (THR), 33 total knee replacements (TKR), 
two shoulder replacements) in 41 patients suffering form HIV. Thirty patients 
are afflicted with hemophilia, seven patients were intravenous drug addicts. The 
mean follow-up was 81 months (2-14) years. Patients were seen annually; either 
the Harris Hip Score or the Knee Society Rating System was applied.
RESULTS: The following septic complications were observed: a mycotic abscess of 
both hips 5/10 months after bilateral THR, two early infections following 
coxitis in patients with intravenous drug abuse, and one further case of septic 
loosening after 15 months in one patient after THR. Furthermore, one aseptic 
loosening of a THR after 14 months in a hemophilic patient was seen. After TKR, 
two early infections in patients with intravenous drug addiction were seen. The 
total complication rate was 12.7%. A coherency between the infection rate and 
the CD4+ count was not seen.
DISCUSSION: An analysis of the results shows that the complications occurred in 
patients living under difficult social circumstances. Whereas total joint 
replacement in hemophilic patients with or without HIV seems to be a fairly safe 
procedure concerning the postoperative infection rate, intravenous drug abuse 
increases the risk. Functional outcome does not differ from an HIV negative 
population both in the TKR and THR groups.

Structures of rhodopsin kinase in different ligand states reveal key elements 
involved in G protein-coupled receptor kinase activation.

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate activated 
heptahelical receptors, leading to their uncoupling from G proteins. Here we 
report six crystal structures of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), revealing not only 
three distinct nucleotide-binding states of a GRK but also two key structural 
elements believed to be involved in the recognition of activated GPCRs. The 
first is the C-terminal extension of the kinase domain, which was observed in 
all nucleotide-bound GRK1 structures. The second is residues 5-30 of the N 
terminus, observed in one of the GRK1.(Mg2+)2.ATP structures. The N terminus was 
also clearly phosphorylated, leading to the identification of two novel 
phosphorylation sites by mass spectral analysis. Co-localization of the N 
terminus and the C-terminal extension near the hinge of the kinase domain 
suggests that activated GPCRs stimulate kinase activity by binding to this 
region to facilitate full closure of the kinase domain.

Cost effectiveness of the Expert Patients Programme (EPP) for patients with 
chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the Expert Patients Programme 
(EPP) intervention compared to a treatment as usual alternative.
DESIGN: Two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial design with waiting list 
control.
SETTING: Community settings in England.
PATIENTS: Patients with a wide range of self-defined long-term conditions.
INTERVENTION: The EPP based on the US chronic disease self management program 
(CDSMP), a lay-led self-care group involving six weekly sessions to teach 
self-care support skills.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs estimated over a 6-month period from a societal 
perspective. Health outcomes estimated in terms of quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) generated by patients' response to the EQ5D at baseline and 6-month 
follow-up.
RESULTS: The intervention group is associated with better patient outcomes, at 
slightly lower cost. Specifically, the intervention group has a 0.020 QALY gain 
compared with the control group, and a reduced cost of around 27 pounds per 
patient. The intervention would therefore be considered dominant. While the 
QALYs gained are small in absolute terms, an additional 0.02 QALY is equivalent 
to an extra one week of perfect health per year. When the value of a QALY is 
20,000 pounds the EPP has a probability of 94% of being cost effective. Indeed, 
for all plausible values of willingness-to-pay for a QALY the EPP group is more 
likely to be cost effective than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The EPP intervention evaluated in this trial is very likely to 
provide a cost effective alternative to usual care in people with long-term 
conditions.

Mechanisms underlying caloric restriction and lifespan regulation: implications 
for vascular aging.

Ungvari Z(1), Parrado-Fernandez C, Csiszar A, de Cabo R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physiology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, USA.

This review focuses on the emerging evidence that attenuation of the production 
of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of inflammatory pathways play a 
central role in the antiaging cardiovascular effects of caloric restriction. 
Particular emphasis is placed on the potential role of the plasma membrane redox 
system in caloric restriction-induced pathways responsible for sensing oxidative 
stress and increasing cellular oxidative stress resistance. We propose that 
caloric restriction increases bioavailability of NO, decreases vascular reactive 
oxygen species generation, activates the Nrf2/antioxidant response element 
pathway, inducing reactive oxygen species detoxification systems, exerts 
antiinflammatory effects, and, thereby, suppresses initiation/progression of 
vascular disease that accompany aging.

BACKGROUND: An increasing life expectancy is often accompanied by a possible 
increase of vertebral fractures. If operative therapy is necessary, open 
procedures might be problematic for elderly patients. In this case, balloon 
kyphoplasty might be an alternative.
METHODS: We present our prospective data of 30 patients with an average age of 
72 years (range 65-82). The patients suffered from isolated thoracic and lumbar 
fractures (T6-L4) without neurological deficits and were operated on with 
balloon kyphoplasty. They were followed up an average of 13 months after 
surgery.
RESULTS: Before surgery, the patients' average kyphotic angle was 12 degrees . 
After reduction with balloon kyphoplasty, this angle was significantly improved 
to 7 degrees , and at follow-up it was 8 degrees . Back pain, which was 
determined by a visual analogous scale, showed a significant reduction from 8.2 
to 2.6 points at follow-up. No significant relationship between preoperative 
pain and improvement of the kyphotic angle could be found. Patients with a bad 
fracture reposition showed significantly more pain at follow-up. However, there 
was no difference between the reference group and the examined patients' quality 
of life regarding general health.
CONCLUSION: Recent fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine in elderly patients 
treated by balloon kyphoplasty showed good early results.

Shaping public policy and population health in the United States: why is the 
public health community missing in action?

Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health 
manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public 
policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international 
interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health 
has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since 
the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and 
public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. 
The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term 
institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. 
U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and 
public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve 
to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health 
researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses.

Death in China: market reforms and health.

10027, USA. sr793@columbia.edu

Has China's remarkable reduction in income poverty since 1980 been accompanied 
by comparable progress in health? The author's findings are fourfold. First, 
province-level rates of improvement in life expectancy (LE) were higher in the 
1990s than in the 1970s and 1980s, and were lowest in the 1980s. Second, even in 
the 1990s, when the province-level rates of improvement in LE were highest, they 
were lower than for many countries with similar initial LE level (although 
higher than the average for all such countries). Third, China's LE improvement 
between 1980 and 2000 was achieved much more quickly by almost all other 
countries considered, and in particular by most lower-middle-income countries 
that had similar LE improvements; similar conclusions are drawn from an analysis 
of China's LE improvements relative to two other sets of comparator 
countries--selected presently rich countries and high-growth East Asian 
countries. Finally, even those Chinese provinces that performed best over the 
period experienced rates of improvement significantly lower than for comparator 
countries. China's experience of reducing health deprivations has been notably 
less impressive than its record of income poverty reduction. There is a need for 
China to invest in the redevelopment of its public health infrastructure, which 
has withered during the period of market-oriented reforms.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the biochemical outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP) 
specifically for men aged 30-39 years, as previous studies suggest that prostate 
cancer in young men might be more aggressive.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a large (15 899) database of RPs (1975-2007) we 
identified 42 men aged 30-39, 893 aged 40-49, 4085 aged 50-59, 3766 aged 60-69, 
and 182 men aged > or =70 years old. The clinical characteristics and treatment 
outcomes were compared between men aged 30-39 years and older men.
RESULTS: Among the men in their thirties, 81% had organ-confined disease in the 
RP specimen, vs 62% of men aged > or =40 years. At a mean follow-up of 5 years, 
there was biochemical progression in 4.8% of men in their thirties and 16.1% of 
men age > or =40 years (P = 0.055). The corresponding 5-year biochemical 
progression-free survival estimates were 95% for men in their thirties and 83% 
for men aged > or =40 years (P = 0.045). On multivariate analysis, increasing 
age was a significant independent predictor of biochemical progression.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to earlier reports, in the present study men in their 
thirties did not have more aggressive disease. Instead, they had more favourable 
pathological features and progression-free survival rates than their older 
counterparts. After controlling for other prognostic variables on multivariate 
analysis, being in the fourth decade was independently associated with a lower 
risk of biochemical progression. These results suggest that early aggressive 
treatment for these patients with a long life-expectancy is associated with 
favourable long-term biochemical outcomes.

Sickle cell disease continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality 
despite increases in life expectancy. This review looks at recent translational 
research in sickle cell disease, covering the red cell membrane, the vascular 
endothelium, local and systemic inflammation and the potentially pivotal role of 
nitric oxide as a key regulator of sickle cell complications. Clinical research 
reviewed includes pulmonary hypertension, which is emerging as a particularly 
deadly scourge of adults with any haemolytic anaemia, and newer insights into 
older, more established complications and treatments, such as red cell 
transfusions, the need for and use of iron chelation and avascular necrosis. 
Finally, recent studies about those factors that affect the day-to-day lives of 
persons with sickle cell disease, pain and neuropsychiatric functioning, are 
discussed.

    Int Braz J Urol. 2008 May-Jun;34(3):365-6.

OBJECTIVE: According to several studies, when the histological subtype of renal 
cell carcinoma is established it is possible to attribute a different life 
expectancy to each patient. We analyzed the prognostic significance of the 
histological subtype in renal cell carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the follow-up of 230 
patients after radical or conservative renal surgery. The histological 
characteristics of the different subtypes of tumor were obtained and the 
disease-free and cancer-specific survival curves for the clear cell, 
cromophobic, papillary, collecting duct (Bellini) subtypes and those with 
sarcomatoid differentiation were individualized.
RESULTS: The disease-free and cancer-specific survival rates for clear cell 
tumors were 76.6% and 68.0% respectively, 71.2% and 82.1% respectively for the 
cromophobic type, 71.1% and 79.8% respectively for the papillary type, 26.9% and 
39.3% respectively for the sarcomatoid type, and 0.0% and 0.0% respectively for 
the collecting ducts (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The histological subtypes of renal tumors can stratify patients into 
different prognostic groups only when the sarcomatoid differentiation is 
present.

Myxozoans are spore-forming, metazoan parasites common in cold-blooded aquatic 
vertebrates, especially fishes, with alternate life cycle stages developing in 
invertebrates. We report nine cases of infection in free-flying native and 
captive exotic ducks (Anseriformes: Anatidae) from locations across the United 
States and describe the first myxozoan in birds, Myxidium anatidum n. sp. We 
found developmental stages and mature spores in the bile ducts of a Pekin duck 
(domesticated Anas platyrhynchos). Spores are lens-shaped in sutural view, 
slightly sigmoidal in valvular view, with two polar capsules, and each valve 
cell has 14-16 longitudinal surface ridges. Spore dimensions are 23.1 microm x 
10.8 microm x 11.2 microm. Phylogenetic analysis of the ssrRNA gene revealed 
closest affinity with Myxidium species described from chelonids (tortoises). Our 
novel finding broadens the definition of the Myxozoa to include birds as hosts 
and has implications for understanding myxozoan evolution, and mechanisms of 
geographical and host range extension. The number of infection records indicates 
this is not an incidental occurrence, and the detection of such widely dispersed 
cases suggests more myxozoans in birds will be encountered with increased 
surveillance of these hosts for pathogens.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential benefits, harms, and 
cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial 
aneurysms in family members of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(SAH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and 
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing magnetic resonance (MR) angiography 
screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms to no screening in 
family members of patients with aneurysmal SAH. Treatment of unruptured 
intracranial aneurysms was determined according to patient age and aneurysm size 
and location. Cohort age was taken as 40 years.
RESULTS: In family members with two or more affected first-degree relatives, 
screening compared with no screening had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $37,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). With screening, life 
expectancy increased from 39.44 years to 39.55 years. The ICER of screening was 
>$50,000 per QALY if age at screening was > or =50 years. In family members with 
one affected first-degree relative, screening compared with no screening had an 
ICER of $56,500 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MR angiography screening for asymptomatic, 
unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members with two or more affected 
first-degree relatives is cost-effective. The benefit and cost-effectiveness are 
dependent on age at screening.

BACKGROUND: Minor depression is common in primary care and associated with 
increased health care costs. Many mildly depressed patients are prescribed 
antidepressants, although there is insufficient information on the 
cost-effectiveness of antidepressants for these patients. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate whether usual care without antidepressants is equivalent 
to (i.e. as effective as and as expensive as) usual care with antidepressants in 
patients with minor or mild-major depression.
METHODS: Severity of depression was measured using the Montgomery Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using 
the EuroQol. Resource use was measured from a societal perspective using cost 
diaries. Bootstrapping was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness data.
RESULTS: Equivalence could not be shown for improvement in MADRS score or QALYs 
gained at 52 weeks. The mean (95% CI) difference in total costs between usual 
care without antidepressants and usual care with antidepressants was -euro751 
(-3601; 1522). Using an equivalence margin of euro500 equivalence in costs could 
not be shown. In the cost-effectiveness analyses equivalence also could not be 
shown.
LIMITATIONS: This study was underpowered for economic outcomes. Another 
limitation was the loss-to-follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Although equivalence could not be shown in the costs and 
cost-effectiveness analyses, 95% confidence intervals also did not show that 
usual care without antidepressants was vastly superior or inferior to usual care 
with antidepressants. Therefore, we recommend general practitioners to show 
restraint when prescribing antidepressants to mildly depressed patients.

The mortality cost to smokers.

Viscusi WK(1), Hersch J.

Author information:
(1)Vanderbilt University, 131 21st Avenue South, Nashville TN 37203, USA.

This article estimates the mortality cost of smoking using the first labor 
market estimates of the value of statistical life by smoking status. The value 
of statistical life is $7 million for both smokers and nonsmokers. Using this 
value in conjunction with the increase in the mortality risk over the life cycle 
due to smoking, the value of statistical life by age and gender, and information 
on the number of packs smoked over the life cycle, the private mortality cost of 
smoking is $222 per pack for men and $94 per pack for women in $2006, based on a 
3% discount rate. At discount rates of 15% or more, the cost decreases to under 
$25 per pack.

The effects of Tabebuia avellanedae (TACE), traditionally prescribed in the 
treatment of cancer, and the naphtoquinone beta-lapachone (beta-lap) on the 
growth and differentiation of granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells 
(CFU-GM) were studied in Ehrlich ascites tumour-bearing mice. Myelosuppression 
concomitant with increases in spleen CFU-GM and in serum colony-stimulating 
activity (CSA) were observed in these animals. Treatment with TACE (30-500 
mg/kg) and beta-lap (1-5mg/kg) reversed these effects in a dose-dependent 
manner. The optimal biologically active doses of 120 mg/kg TACE and 1mg/kg 
beta-lap prolonged life span of tumour-bearing mice, both producing the same 
rate of extension in the duration of survival. Toxic manifestations were 
produced by the higher doses of beta-lap in normal and tumour-bearing mice. In 
spite of similarities between treatments, TACE concentrations used to treat the 
animals presented no traces of beta-lap, as measured by TLC and HPLC analyses. 
Our findings suggest that the antitumour effect of TACE and beta-lap, acting 
synergistically with other factors, such as specific cytokines, may result from 
enhanced macrophage activation against tumour cells. In addition, it is clear 
from our results that hematopoietic disorders produced by tumours are an 
important pathological condition that must be considered in drug development.

Economic evaluation of sunitinib malate in second-line treatment of metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma in Finland.

Pharmacy, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland. Timo.Purmonen@uku.fi

BACKGROUND: Cytokine therapy is currently used as first-line treatment of 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Until recently, treatments with proven 
efficacy after the failure of first-line cytokine therapy were not available. In 
recent clinical trials, sunitinib has been associated with good response rates 
in patients with mRCC.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 
sunitinib as second-line therapy for cytokine-refractory mRCC compared with 
current routine clinical practice in Finland (ie, best supportive care [BSC], 
including palliative biochemotherapy).
METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of sunitinib. Data were gathered from clinical trials, 
literature sources, and expert opinions, as well as from a local sample (n = 39) 
from 2 university hospitals in Finland. Clinical experts treating patients with 
mRCC in Finland provided the information on care practices of prescribing 
sunitinib. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the health care 
payer in Finland.
RESULTS: According to estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 1 
progression-free month gained cost euro4802 (2005 Euros); 1 life-year gained 
cost euro30,831; and 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained cost euro43,698, 
compared with BSC, in the treatment of mRCC. The expected mean cost in BSC was 
euro5543. When parameter uncertainty was considered, the probability of 
sunitinib being the more cost-effective choice of treatment was ~70% at the 
willingness-to-pay level of euro45,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this cost-effectiveness analysis, sunitinib 
is potentially cost-effective as a second-line treatment of mRCC compared with 
the treatment currently practiced in Finnish hospitals. The ICER (euro/QALY 
gained) obtained in the present study was less than the value considered 
suitable for novel oncology treatments.
