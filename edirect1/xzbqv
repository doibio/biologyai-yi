to clinical benefit. Diseased dogs treated with rAAV.caTPP1 showed delays in 
onset of clinical signs and disease progression, protection from cognitive 
decline, and extension of life span. By immunostaining and enzyme assay, 
recombinant protein was evident throughout the brain and spinal cord, with 
correction of the neuropathology characteristic of the disease. This study in a 
naturally occurring canine model of TPP1 deficiency highlights the utility of 
AAV transduction of ventricular lining cells to accomplish stable secretion of 
recombinant protein for broad distribution in the central nervous system and 
therapeutic benefit.

Protein anabolic resistance in cancer: does it really exist?

and Kinesiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Preventing unintentional weight and muscle loss is of crucial 
importance to maintain the condition and well-being of patients with cancer, 
improve treatment response and tolerance, and prolong survival. Anabolic 
resistance might explain why some cancer patients do not respond to nutritional 
intervention, but does recent evidence actually support this? We will discuss 
recent literature that casts doubt on attenuated anabolic potential in cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although anabolic resistance was observed in the past, more 
recent studies have shown that advanced cancer patients have an anabolic 
potential after intake of high-quality proteins. Furthermore, a consistent 
linear relationship is observed in cancer between (essential) amino acid 
availability from the diet and net protein gain. The studied cancer patients, 
however, were often characterized by a normal or obese body weight, following 
the trend in the general population, and mild systemic inflammation. Factors 
like recent chemotherapy, surgery, or cachexia do not seem to attenuate the 
anabolic potential to feeding.
SUMMARY: Cancer patients have a normal anabolic potential which relates to the 
amount of essential amino acids in the meal. It remains to be determined if this 
is also the case in weak cancer patients with a short life expectancy and high 
systemic inflammation.

OBJECTIVES: The balance between the amount of time spent in work and in 
retirement underlies the long-term sustainability of the social security system. 
We examined socioeconomic differences in how increasing longevity is distributed 
between labor market statuses in Finland.
METHOD: We used register data and the Sullivan method to analyze life expectancy 
at age 50 spent in different labor market statuses over the period 1989-2012 and 
across cohorts born in 1938-1953. We projected the future mortality and labor 
market participation rates of partially observed cohorts.
RESULTS: Both working life expectancy at age 50 and the share of remaining life 
spent in work have increased across periods following the recession of the early 
1990s, and across successive cohorts. The trends were similar across the social 
classes, but there were large differences in the numbers of years spent in 
various states: for the most recent period and the youngest cohort, we find that 
compared with upper non-manual employees, male and female manual workers were 
expected to spend 3.6-3.7 fewer years in work, 1.7-4.7 fewer years in statutory 
retirement, and 3.2-3.9 more years in other forms of nonemployment.
DISCUSSION: Our finding that the share of remaining life at age 50 spent in work 
is increasing implies that pressure on the welfare system is not as severe as is 
commonly thought.

Lifespan and Healthspan: Past, Present, and Promise.

Crimmins EM(1).

Author information:

The past century was a period of increasing life expectancy throughout the age 
range. This resulted in more people living to old age and to spending more years 
at the older ages. It is likely that increases in life expectancy at older ages 
will continue, but life expectancy at birth is unlikely to reach levels above 95 
unless there is a fundamental change in our ability to delay the aging process. 
We have yet to experience much compression of morbidity as the age of onset of 
most health problems has not increased markedly. In recent decades, there have 
been some reductions in the prevalence of physical disability and dementia. At 
the same time, the prevalence of disease has increased markedly, in large part 
due to treatment which extends life for those with disease. Compressing 
morbidity or increasing the relative healthspan will require "delaying aging" or 
delaying the physiological change that results in disease and disability. While 
moving to life expectancies above age 95 and compressing morbidity substantially 
may require significant scientific breakthroughs; significant improvement in 
health and increases in life expectancy in the United States could be achieved 
with behavioral, life style, and policy changes that reduce socioeconomic 
disparities and allow us to reach the levels of health and life expectancy 
achieved in peer societies.

Reference for Rare Iron Overload Diseases , University Hospital Pontchaillou , 
Rennes , France.

A number of human disorders are related to chronic iron overload, either of 
genetic or acquired origin. The multi-organ damage produced by iron excess 
leads, in adults and in children, to severe clinical consequences, affecting 
both quality of life and life expectancy. The diagnosis is increasingly based on 
a non-invasive strategy, resorting to clinical, biological and imaging data. The 
treatment rests on either venesection or chelation therapy, depending on the 
etiology. Major advances in the fields of molecular biology, pharmacology, and 
biotechnology pave the road for key improvements in the diagnostic and 
therapeutic management of the patients.

Brescia, Brescia, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular reconstruction in head and neck surgery is increasing 
in the elderly because of prolonged life expectancy. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the impact of age on outcomes after microvascular 
reconstruction.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 453 microvascular reconstructions and 
stratified patients according to age (40.8% >65 years old). Medical and surgical 
complications and flap success rates were evaluated according to the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score for physical status and age.
RESULTS: Overall flap success and perioperative mortality were 96.1% and 0.7%, 
respectively. Minor medical complications were higher in the elderly (28.1% vs 
15.3%; p = .001). High ASA scores affected rates of major surgical (20% vs 9.2%; 
p = .001) and minor medical complications (27.2% vs 13.3%; p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Microvascular reconstruction is reliable in the elderly. Age should 
not be considered a contraindication by itself; comorbidities play a stronger 
role in predicting adverse events. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38:

Prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is under 
expectation. Life expectancy more than 3 months is one inclusion criteria for 
molecular targeted drugs in clinical trials. The main purpose of this research 
is to compare Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and four MELD-based 
prognostic models in predicting the survival rate of advanced HCC patients. One 
hundred eighty-three patients with advanced HCC who were not amendable to 
standard anti-tumor therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected 
to classify patients according to MELD, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with 
the incorporation of serum sodium (MELD-NA), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
to ascites and sodium (MELD-AS), integrated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
(iMELD), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease to sodium (MESO) scores at 
diagnosis. 1-, 3-, and 6-month survivals were the end points used in the 
analysis. When predicting 1-month survival, MELD-AS, MELD, and MESO were the top 
3 ranking staging systems. When predicting 3-month survival, area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of MELD-AS is significantly higher 
than that of the other models (P < 0.05). When predicting 6-month survival, AUCs 
of MELD-AS and MELD-NA are significantly higher than those of the other models 
(P < 0.05). Cutoff point of MELD-AS is 23.11 with 40.5 % sensitivity and 93.8 % 
specificity at 1 month, 9.5 with 76.9 % sensitivity and 59.5 % specificity at 
3 months, and 18.5 with 27.0 % sensitivity and 89.1 % specificity at 6 months. 
MELD-based scores of death group are significantly higher than those of 
survivors within 1 and 3 months (P < 0.001). Independent prognostic factors 
identified by multivariate analysis included persistent ascites, serum sodium, 
and thrombosis. MELD-AS is the best model in the prediction of short and 
intermediate survival among the five models for end-stage liver disease analyzed 
for Chinese advanced HCC patients.

This paper has changed the vague understanding that "the short-lived buildings 
have huge environmental footprints (EF)" into a concrete one. By estimating the 
annual floor space of buildings demolished and calibrating the average building 
lifetime in China, this paper compared the EF under various assumptive extended 
buildings' lifetime scenarios based on time-series environmental-extended 
input-output model. Results show that if the average buildings' lifetime in 
China can be extended from the current 23.2 years to their designed life 
expectancy, 50 years, in 2011, China can reduce 5.8 Gt of water withdrawal, 
127.1 Mtce of energy consumption, and 426.0 Mt of carbon emissions, each of 
which is equivalent to the corresponding annual EF of Belgium, Mexico, and 
Italy. These findings will urge China to extend the lifetime of existing and new 
buildings, in order to reduce the EF from further urbanization. This paper also 
verifies that the lifetime of a product or the replacement rate of a sector is a 
very important factor that influences the cumulative EF. When making policies to 
reduce the EF, adjusting people's behaviors to extend the lifetime of products 
or reduce the replacement rate of sectors may be a very simple and 
cost-effective option.

outpatients.

L(2).

OBJECTIVES: The study examined: 1) the proportion of patients who received their 
preferred level of information about life expectancy; and 2) sociodemographic, 
clinical and psychological factors associated with patients' perceptions of 
whether they received too little, too much, or the right amount of information 
about life expectancy.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: Eleven large Australian medical oncology treatment centres.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1431 medical oncology outpatients participated (81% 
consent rate). Eligible patients were approached between September 2012 and May 
2014.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients indicated whether the information about life 
expectancy they received aligned with their preferences.
RESULTS: Almost one in four patients (24%) received too little information, 4% 
received too much, and 50% received all the information they wanted; 22% of 
patients neither wanted nor received information about life expectancy. Patients 
were more likely to receive too little information if they were not in remission 
(odds ratio [OR], 1.77), did not know their cancer stage at diagnosis (OR, 
3.64), or were anxious (OR, 1.48) or depressed (OR, 1.48). Patients had greater 
odds of receiving too much information if they were younger (OR, 1.45), had more 
advanced cancer (OR, 2.01) or did not know their cancer stage at diagnosis (OR, 
4.42).
CONCLUSIONS: That fact that 28% of cancer patients did not receive their desired 
level of information about life expectancy highlights the difficulties 
associated with discussing this sensitive topic. To ensure that life expectancy 
discussions correspond with patient preferences, clinicians should routinely ask 
patients whether they want to know this information, in what format, and at 
which level of detail.

School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. Thomas Plümper is with

OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of market income inequality (income 
inequality before taxes and transfers) and income redistribution via taxes and 
transfers on inequality in longevity.
METHODS: We used life tables to compute Gini coefficients of longevity 
inequality for all individuals and for individuals who survived to at least 10 
years of age. We regressed longevity inequality on market income inequality and 
income redistribution, and we controlled for potential confounders, in a 
cross-sectional time-series sample of up to 28 predominantly Western developed 
countries and up to 37 years (1974-2011).
RESULTS: Income inequality before taxes and transfers was positively associated 
with inequality in the number of years lived; income redistribution (the 
difference between market income inequality and income inequality after taxes 
and transfers were accounted for) was negatively associated with longevity 
inequality.
CONCLUSIONS: To the extent that our estimated effects derived from observational 
data are causal, governments can reduce longevity inequality not only via public 
health policies, but also via their influence on market income inequality and 
the redistribution of incomes from the relatively rich to the relatively poor.

Effects of lead exposure on dendrite and spine development in hippocampal 
dentate gyrus areas of rats.

Lead exposure has been implicated in the impairment of synaptic plasticity in 
the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) areas of rats. However, whether the 
degradation of physiological properties is based on the morphological alteration 
of granule neurons in DG areas remains elusive. Here, we examined the dendritic 
branch extension and spine formation of granule neurons after lead exposure 
during development in rats. Dendritic morphology was studied using Golgi-Cox 
stain method, which was followed by Sholl analysis at postnatal days 14 and 21. 
Our results indicated that, for both ages, lead exposure significantly decreased 
the total dendritic length and spine density of granule neurons in the DG of the 
rat hippocampus. Further branch order analysis revealed that the decrease of 
dendritic length was observed only at the second branch order. Moreover, there 
were obvious deficits in the proportion and size of mushroom-type spines. These 
deficits in spine formation and maturity were accompanied by a decrease in 
Arc/Arg3.1 expression. Our present findings are the first to show that 
developmental lead exposure disturbs branch and spine formation in hippocampal 
DG areas. Arc/Arg3.1 may have a critical role in the disruption of neuronal 
morphology and synaptic plasticity in lead-exposed rats.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common ophthalmic condition that can 
have few symptoms in its early stage but can progress to major visual 
impairment. While there are no treatments for early-stage AMD, there are 
multiple modalities of treatment for advanced disease. Given the increasing 
prevalence of the disease, there are dozens of analyses of cost effectiveness of 
AMD treatments, but methods and approaches vary broadly. The goal of this review 
was to identify, characterize, and critique published models in AMD and provide 
guidance for their interpretation. After a literature review was performed to 
identify studies, and exclusion criteria applied to limit the review to studies 
comparing treatments for AMD, we compared methods across the 36 studies meeting 
the review criteria. To some extent, variation was related to targeting 
different audiences or acknowledging the most appropriate population for a given 
treatment. However, the review identified potential areas of uncertainty and 
difficulty in interpretation, particularly regarding duration of observation 
periods and the importance of visual acuity as an endpoint or a proxy for 
patient-reported utilities. We urge thoughtful consideration of these study 
characteristics when comparing results.

PURPOSE: Nonspecific factors that accompany healthcare treatments, such as 
patients' attitudes and expectations, are important parts of the experience of 
care and can influence outcomes. However, no precise, concise, and generalizable 
instruments to measure these factors exist. We report on the development and 
calibration of new item banks, titled the Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists 
(HEAL), that assess nonspecific factors across a broad range of treatments and 
conditions.
METHODS: The instrument development methodology of the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)) was used. Patient focus groups and 
clinician interviews informed our HEAL conceptual model. Literature searches of 
eight databases yielded over 500 instruments and resulted in an initial item 
pool of several thousand items. After qualitative item analysis, including 
cognitive interviewing, 296 items were included in field testing. The 
calibration sample included 1657 respondents, 1400 obtained through an Internet 
panel and 257 from conventional and integrative medicine clinics. Following 
exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the HEAL item banks were 
calibrated using item response theory.
RESULTS: The final HEAL item banks were Patient-Provider Connection (57 items), 
Healthcare Environment (25 items), Treatment Expectancy (27 items), Positive 
Outlook (27 items), and Spirituality (26 items). Short forms were also developed 
from each item bank. A six-item short form, Attitudes toward Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine (CAM), was also created.
CONCLUSIONS: HEAL item banks provided substantial information across a broad 
range of each construct. HEAL item banks showed initial evidence of predictive 
and concurrent validity, suggesting that they are suitable for measuring 
nonspecific factors in treatment.

BACKGROUND: Proximal femoral fractures are often seen in older patients and are 
associated with high mortality. Introduction to old age population is latening 
due to advancements in medical sciences and increasing life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate factors affecting mortality in 
patients above 75 years of age who had been operated because of proximal femur 
fractures.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with age 75 and over who suffers from post-fall 
proximal femoral fracture who underwent surgery with one of following three 
methods (hemiarthroplasty, proximal femoral nail or total hip arthroplasty) were 
evaluated retrospectively. Effects on mortality were examined for factors such 
as type of surgery, type of anesthesia, preoperative ASA score (American Society 
of Anesthesiologists Score), need for intensive care, need for blood 
transfusion, operation waiting time and hospitalization duration. 115 patients 
who met inclusion criterion were included in the study out of 224 overall. 75 
patients were women and 40 were males.
RESULTS: Mortality rate after first year was found to be 40%. Patients over 85 
years old had higher rates of mortality (p = 0,0003) than respectively younger 
patients (75-85). Sex was found to have no impact on mortality (p = 0.5039). 
There was no statistically significant difference in terms ASA score (p = 
0.1518). Order of applied surgical methods with mortality risk rates was found 
to be total hip arthroplasty > hemiarthroplasty > proximal femoral nail (p = 
0.0003). Type of anesthesia, the use of cement during arthroplasty, operation 
waiting time and hospitalization duration was not directly related with 
mortality rate (type of anesthesia p = 0.63, the use of cement during 
arthroplasty p = 0.223, operation waiting time p = 0.5 and hospitalization 
duration p = 0.19).
CONCLUSIONS: Age is the primary risk factor on first year mortality in patients 
older than 75 years old with hip fractures. Addition to older age, more need to 
blood transfusions, and arthroplasty are other risk factors for first year 
mortality. It should be kept in mind that after 75 years old first year 
mortality may be higher if the patient is treated with arthroplasty.

Major trauma is a leading cause of death, particularly amongst young patients. 
Conventional therapies for post-traumatic cardiovascular shock and acute 
pulmonary failure may sometimes be insufficient and even dangerous. New 
approaches to trauma care and novel salvage techniques are necessary to improve 
outcomes. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has proven to be effective in acute 
cardiopulmonary failure from different etiologies, particularly when 
conventional therapies fail. Since 2008 we have used ECLS as a rescue therapy in 
severe poly-trauma patients with refractory clinical setting (cardiogenic shock, 
cardiac arrest, and/or pulmonary failure). The rationale for using ECLS in 
trauma patients is to support cardiopulmonary function, providing adequate 
systemic perfusion and, therefore, avoiding consequent multi-organ failure and 
permitting organ recovery. From our data ECLS, utilizing heparin-coated support 
to avoid systemic anticoagulation, is a valuable option to support severely 
injured patients when conventional therapies are insufficient. It is safe, 
feasible, and effective in providing hemodynamic support and blood-gas exchange. 
Moreover, we have identified several pre-ECLS patient characteristics useful in 
predicting ECLS treatment appropriateness in severe poly-traumatized patients. 
These might be helpful in deciding whether the ECLS should be initiated in 
patients who are severely complex and compromised. Future improvements in 
materials and techniques are expected to make ECLS even easier and safer to 
manage, leading to a further extension of its use in severely injured patients.

Linking and retaining people living with HIV in ongoing, HIV medical care is 
vital for ending the U.S. HIV epidemic. Yet, 41-44 % of HIV+ individuals are out 
of care. In response, AIDS United initiated Positive Charge, a series of five 
HIV linkage and re-engagement projects around the U.S. This paper investigates 
whether three Positive Charge programs were cost effective and calculates a 
return on investment for each program. It uses standard methods of cost utility 
analysis and WHO-CHOICE thresholds. All three projects were found to be cost 
effective, and two were highly cost effective. Cost utility ratios ranged from 
$4439 to $137,271. These results suggest that HIV linkage to care programs are a 
productive and efficient use of public health funds.

Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK. Electronic address: gareth.evans@cmft.nhs.uk.

Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene NF2 on chromosome 22. Around 1 in 
33000 people are born with an NF2 mutation although more than one-third of the 
60% of de novo cases are not conceived with the mutation but this develops later 
in embryogenesis (mosaics). NF2 has a substantial effect on life expectancy and 
individuals with a constitutional truncating mutation have the worst prognosis. 
The vast majority of people with NF2 will develop bilateral vestibular 
schwannomas with many developing schwannomas on other cranial, spinal and 
peripheral nerves. Cranial and spinal meningiomas and intraspinal low grade 
indolent ependymomas are the other major tumor features. Cutaneous features can 
be subtle with only 70% having evidence of intracutaneous plaque-like 
schwannomas or subcutaneous lesions on peripheral nerves. Café-au-lait patches 
are more frequent than in the general population but in only around 1% will meet 
NIH criteria for NF1.

Basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) or Gorlin syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous 
syndrome sometimes known as the fifth phacomatosis, inherited in autosomal 
dominant fashion with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Gorlin 
syndrome is characterized by development of multiple basal cell carcinomas 
(BCCs), jaw cysts, palmar or plantar pits, calcification of falx cerebri, 
various developmental skeletal abnormalities such as bifid rib, hemi- or bifid 
vertebra and predisposition to the development of various tumors. BCNS is caused 
by a mutation in the PTCH1 gene localized to 9q22.3. Its estimated prevalence 
varies between 1/55600 and 1/256000 with an equal male to female ratio. The 
medulloblastoma variant seen in Gorlin syndrome patients is of the desmoplastic 
type, characteristically presenting during the first 3 years of life. Therefore, 
children with desmoplastic medulloblastoma should be carefully screened for 
other features of BCNS. Radiation therapy for desmoplastic medulloblastoma 
should be avoided in BCNS patients as it may induce development of invasive BCCs 
and other tumors in the skin area exposed to radiation. This syndrome is a 
multisystem disorder so involvement of multiple specialists with a multimodal 
approach to detect and treat various manifestations at early stages will reduce 
the long-term sequelae and severity of the condition. Life expectancy is not 
significantly altered but morbidity from complications and cosmetic scarring can 
be substantial.

von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inheritable condition with an incidence of 
1 in 36000 live births. Individuals with VHL develop benign and malignant tumors 
including retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal 
cell carcinomas (RCC), pheochromocytomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and 
endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs). VHL is caused by germline loss of function of 
the VHL gene on one allele at chromosome 3p25-26. A somatic "second hit" event 
leads to the loss of the other allele and tumor formation. Loss of VHL function 
in cells leads to increased expression and stabilization of hypoxia inducible 
factor (HIF). VHL protein/HIF pathway has been implicated in tumorigenesis for 
hemangioblastomas, RCC and other VHL tumors. Clinical examination, imaging, and 
genetic testing for VHL mutations confirm VHL disease. Management of VHL disease 
largely consists of surgical resection of symptomatic tumors 
(hemangioblastomas), tumors prone to metastasize (RCC larger than 3cm), or 
tumors causing hormonal symptoms (pheochromocytomas). Despite advances in early 
diagnosis and management of VHL disease, life expectancy for VHL patients 
remains low at 40-52 years. Secondary effects from VHL manifestations are 
mitigated by routine surveillance and early detection. In this chapter, we 
summarize the current state of knowledge in VHL disease.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost effectiveness of HIV screening project in three 
Guangxi infectious disease special demonstration project countries in 2013.
METHODS: To calculate the funds used for the HIV screening project and to study 
the data on HIV/AIDS and HAART. A five-tree markov model was used to evaluate 
the quality adjusted life year (QALY) of this HIV screening project and to 
analyze the related cost effectiveness of the project.
RESULTS: The cost of HIV screening in Guangxi infectious disease special 
demonstration project areas was 19.205 million Yuan and having identified 1 218 
HIV/AIDS patients. The average costs for HIV/AIDS positive detection in three 
project countries were 14.562, 18.424 and 14.042 thousand Yuan per case. The 
QALYs gained from finding a HIV/AIDS case were 12.736, 8.523 and 8.321 on 
average, with the total number of QALYs gained from the project as 5 973.184, 3 
613.752 and 2 704.325. The overall cost effectiveness ratio of the project was 
1.562 thousand Yuan per QALY, and 1.143, 2.162 and 1.688 thousand Yuan per QALY 
in these three project countries. Project country "A" showed better cost 
effectiveness index than country B and C.
CONCLUSION: The HIV screening project in Guangxi seemed relatively 
cost-effective but the average cost of HIV/AIDS positive detection was 
expensive. To strengthen HAART work for HIV/AIDS could improve the 
cost-effective of the project.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected individuals are affected by 
diseases at rates above those of their HIV-negative peers despite the increased 
life expectancy of the highly active antiretroviral therapy era. We followed a 
cohort of approximately 2000 HIV-1-infected patients for 5 years. The most 
frequent cause of death in this HIV-1-infected cohort was malignancy, with 39% 
of all classified deaths due to cancer. Among the cancer deaths, B-cell 
lymphomas were the most commonly seen malignancy, representing 34% of all cancer 
deaths. These lymphomas were very aggressive with a median survival of <2 months 
from time of diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: As child mortality decreases rapidly worldwide, premature adult 
mortality is becoming an increasingly important contributor to global mortality. 
Any possible worldwide reduction of premature adult mortality before the age of 
70 years will depend on progress in India. Indian districts increasingly have 
responsibility for implementing public health programmes. We aimed to assess 
age-specific and sex-specific adult mortality risks in India at the district 
level.
METHODS: We analysed data from five national surveys of 0·27 million adult 
deaths at an age of 15-69 years together with 2014 demographic data to estimate 
age-specific and sex-specific adult mortality risks for 597 districts. Cause of 
death data were drawn from the verbal autopsies in the Registrar General of 
India's ongoing Million Death Study.
FINDINGS: In 2014, about two-fifths of India's men aged 15-69 years lived in the 
253 districts where the conditional probability of a man dying at these ages 
exceeded 50%, and more than a third of India's women aged 15-69 years lived in 
the 222 districts where the conditional probability of a woman dying exceeded 
40%. The probabilities of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in 
high-mortality districts was 62% and 54%, respectively, whereas the probability 
of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in low-mortality districts was 
40% and 30%, respectively. The roughly 10-year survival gap between 
high-mortality and low-mortality districts was nearly as extreme as the survival 
gap between the entire Indian population and people living in high-income 
countries. Adult mortality risks at ages 15-69 years was highest in east India 
and lowest in west India, by contrast with the north-south divide for child 
mortality. Vascular disease, tuberculosis, malaria and other infections, and 
respiratory diseases accounted for about 60% of the absolute gap in adult 
mortality risk at ages 15-69 years between high-mortality and low-mortality 
districts. Most of the variation in adult mortality could not be explained by 
known determinants or risk factors for premature mortality.
INTERPRETATION: India's large variation in adult mortality by district, notably 
the higher death rates in eastern India, requires further aetiological research, 
particularly to explore whether high levels of adult mortality risks from 
infections and non-communicable diseases are a result of historical childhood 
malnutrition and infection. Such research can be complemented by an expanded 
coverage of known effective interventions to reduce adult mortality, especially 
in high-mortality districts.

Health System, Singapore.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of haemodialysis (HD), 
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal 
dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Singapore.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to examine the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of HD, CAPD and APD over the 10-year time 
horizon from the societal perspective, using clinical data from an observational 
study and the national renal registry, utilities from published studies and 
costs from dialysis services providers. The base-case analysis was for a 
hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old non-diabetic ESRD patients. A high-risk group 
of 60-year-old diabetic ESRD patients was also studied.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
3.27 with CAPD, 3.48 with APD and 4.69 with HD. The total costs were Singapore 
dollar $169 872 for CAPD, $201 509 for APD and $306 827 for HD. CAPD and HD had 
extended dominance over APD. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $96 447 (US$69 121) 
per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most 
sensitive to the utility of HD. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
that CAPD had the maximum probability of being cost-effective among treatments 
under evaluation at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $60 000 (US$43 000) 
per QALY. The high-risk group analyses showed similar results. The ICER of HD 
versus CAPD was $106 281 (US$76 168) per QALY and the probability of CAPD being 
optimal was the highest using the same WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that starting dialysis with CAPD is most 
cost-effective for ESRD patients in Singapore.
