or surgical referral for implant removal and distal femur replacement. The 
patient elected to undergo revision surgery consisting of distal femoral 
replacement. Following revision surgery, the patient was discharged with 
physical therapy referral. She disclosed a decrease in pain and increased range 
of motion (ROM) compared to the preoperative state. This case demonstrates an 
elderly, obese patient with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes 
mellitus and autoimmune conditions that placed the patient at high risk for 
hardware failure following surgery. Due to pain and quality of life concerns, 
patients with such injuries may be forced into a situation with limited options. 
This case highlights the need for optimal surgeon-to-patient communication to 
ensure that patients and all members of their healthcare team are knowledgeable 
when certain clinical situations are considered high risk for failure. Moving 
forward, risk factor consideration and medication adjustments are preoperative 
topics of discussion that should be discussed at length with the patient in 
order to provide the best opportunity for a successful surgery.

BACKGROUND:  Estimated life expectancy for patients with geriatric hip fracture 
can help guide treatment selection, especially the choice between 
hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty for a femoral neck fracture. The 
purpose of the present study is to determine the survival pattern of a large 
cohort of geriatric female patients with hip fracture, as a function of age, for 
10 years or more after injury.
METHODS:  All female patients between the ages of 65 and 99 who were treated 
surgically for hip fractures within the Veterans Affairs healthcare system from 
2000 to 2010 were assessed. For every patient, the age at surgery and the age at 
death (if any) were recorded as of August 2021, a date at least 10.5 years after 
surgery.  Results: There were 818 patients in the cohort. The mean age at the 
time of fracture treatment was 81.2 years. Femoral neck fractures were found in 
58% of the population. The survival rate for the entire group at one year was 
73.7%; at two years, 62.7%; at five years, 38.6%; and at 10 years,13.7%. The 
median length of survival was 3.42 years, decreasing by age: for the 65-69 
cohort, median survival was 8.18 years, whereas, for those 90 and above, median 
survival was 1.75 years. Median life expectancy could be approximated by the 
equation (100 - Patient Age) ÷ 4. Survival was not meaningfully affected by 
fracture type.  Conclusions: Geriatric hip fracture is associated with a high 
mortality rate. The median survival is highly correlated with age, such that an 
estimation equation, (100 - Patient Age) ÷ 4, offers a reliable shorthand for 
approximating it.

BACKGROUND: No comprehensive studies have been published on the global burden of 
alopecia areata since 2010.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the global, regional, and national incidence of 
alopecia areata and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age, sex, and 
socio-demographic index (SDI) value from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify temporal 
trends in the age-standardized rates of alopecia areata incidence and DALYs. The 
correlations between EAPCs in the age-standardized rates and SDI values were 
also analyzed.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the alopecia areata incidence number and the 
associated number of DALYs increased globally by 49.14%, and 49.51%, 
respectively. The global age-standardized incidence rate decreased (EAPC, -0.13; 
95% confidence interval [CI], -0.13 to -0.12) and the age-standardized DALY rate 
showed a downward trend (EAPC, -0.12; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.11). The largest 
increases in the age-standardized incidence rate and age-standardized DALY rate 
were observed in Low SDI quintile and Western Sub-Saharan Africa regions. The 
regions with the greatest changes in the incidence of alopecia areata were 
Central Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sub-Saharan Africa. The three countries 
with the largest increases in alopecia areata incidence from 1990 to 2019 were 
Kuwait (EAPC, 0.15), South Sudan (EAPC, 0.12), and Nigeria (EAPC, 0.11). The 
age-standardized incidence rate was higher in females than in males.
CONCLUSION: Globally, both the age-standardized incidence rate and 
age-standardized DALY rate of alopecia areata showed decreasing trends. Future 
preventive strategies should focus on low-income countries, Central Sub-Saharan 
Africa, Western Sub-Saharan Africa, Kuwait, South Sudan, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Since women spend about one-third of their lifespan in menopause, 
accurate prediction of the age of natural menopause and its effective parameters 
are crucial to increase women's life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performance of generalized linear 
models (GLM) and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method in predicting the age 
of natural menopause in a large population of Iranian women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 
the recruitment phase of the Shahedieh Cohort Study, Yazd, Iran. In total, 1251 
women who had the experience of natural menopause were included. For modeling 
natural menopause, the multiple linear regression model was employed using the 
ordinary least squares method and GLMs. With the help of the Akaike information 
criterion, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error, the 
performance of regression models was measured.
RESULTS: The mean age of menopausal women was 49.1 ± 4.7 yr (95% CI: 48.8-49.3) 
with a median of 50 yr. The analysis showed similar Akaike criterion values for 
the multiple linear models with the OLS technique and the GLM with the Gaussian 
family. However, the RMSE and mean absolute error values were much lower in GLM. 
In all the models, education, history of salpingectomy, diabetes, cardiac 
ischemic, and depression were significantly associated with menopausal age.
CONCLUSION: To predict the age of natural menopause in this study, the GLM with 
the Gaussian family and the log link function with reduced RMSE and mean 
absolute error can be a good alternative for modeling menopausal age.

Boston, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the leading causes of work 
disability in the United States. Ergonomic interventions offer an individualized 
treatment approach, and when used in conjunction with pharmacological treatment 
interventions, may improve work outcomes and improve the overall quality of life 
for individuals with RA.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the current body of evidence regarding the effectiveness 
of ergonomic interventions in reducing work activity limitations in adults with 
RA.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify articles of ergonomic 
interventions targeting working adults with RA. The CONsolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist and Non-Pharmacological Treatment (NPT) 
Extension evaluated the reporting quality of each randomized controlled trial 
(RCT), and the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
(GRADE) evaluated the quality of the evidence.
RESULTS: Six studies were identified and reviewed for the quality of their 
reporting on evidence related to work activity limitations. Sixty-six percent of 
the items on the CONSORT checklist were fully reported by all studies and 
analysis through the GRADE framework demonstrated moderate confidence that the 
reported effects of ergonomic interventions on work activity limitations in the 
studies are accurate. This review revealed varied results for the effectiveness 
of ergonomic interventions on work activity limitations and at-work 
productivity.
CONCLUSION: The results of this review indicate a need for further 
investigation. Future studies should focus on reviewing specific ergonomic 
interventions to determine the dosage needed to see results in reducing work 
activity limitations for working adults with RA.

University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel are among the COVID-19 risk groups. For this 
reason, increased absence from work affects the loss of labor.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the workforce loss amongst health 
personnel working in our hospital due to COVID-19 in a one-year period.
METHODS: Workforce loss of healthcare workers was assessed via absenteeism and 
life expectancy. Loss of workforce for COVID-19 PCR positive or PCR negative but 
CT findings compatible with COVID-19 and personnel with high-risk exposure for 
COVID-19 were determined with absenteeism. Healthcare personnel who passed away 
due to COVID-19 was determined with the consideration of the retirement age and 
expected life years.
RESULTS: Total lost time from work was 14635 days (excluding deaths). Loss of 
workforce rates resulting from COVID-19 positivity for male employees was 
greater in comparison to the results for females (p = 0.018). High-risk exposure 
of healthcare personnel working in clinical sciences was higher than those in 
other departments (p < 0.001). Total loss in workforce for 3 people passed away 
was 14 years 5 months, and total life expectancy was 64 years. Healthcare 
personnel under the age of 40 had less absenteeism than those over 40 years 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that all occupational groups working at the 
hospital were impacted by COVID-19. The two most important factors that 
influenced absenteeism were the reason for being affected (positivity and high 
risk) and age. Absenteeism and daily case tracing of healthcare personnel 
working on the frontlines will aid in both the pandemic control and management 
of workload for those left behind.

Emerging drugs for the treatment of sickle cell disease: a review of phase 
II/III trials.

l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

INTRODUCTION: The substitution of glutamic acid by valine on the ß-globin chain 
produces the hemoglobin S variant responsible for sickle cell disease (SCD), a 
disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and leads to acute and 
cumulative organ damage. Even though life expectancy has significantly improved 
where the best medical care is available, there are still few therapeutic 
options for SCD and those are limited by their availability, cost, and 
individual toxicities.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the clinical data on current treatments 
for SCD and emerging therapies studied in the acute setting as well as potential 
disease-modifying agents, with an emphasis on the FDA-approved agents.
EXPERT OPINION: Hydroxyurea has been a gold standard for two decades, showing 
benefits in acute complications and overall survival in sickle cell anemia, 
although data is lacking for certain genotypes such as hemoglobin SC. As 
progress is made in our understanding of the pathophysiological networks 
characterizing SCD, numerous pathways appear to be targetable, with L-glutamine, 
crizanlizumab and voxelotor now approved by the FDA. Pursuing a multi-agent 
approach could alter the disease course in a more effective fashion and provide 
an alternative option to curative therapies, but longer clinical studies are 
needed.

Aging the death: the importance of having better methods for age at death 
estimation of old individuals.

Portugal.

While trying to return the identity to human remains, the forensic 
anthropologist has to estimate four basic parameters: sex, age at death, 
ancestry, and stature. These are the so-called big four parameters of 
identification which altogether with the identity factors can allow a positive 
identification, which enables the return of the remains to the families. This 
presentation focusses the problematic of age estimation of older individuals 
which is a very relevant question since a lot of "John Doe's" are old 
individuals who lived alone and/or who got lost. Besides, with the increase in 
life expectancy, this is, more and more, a significant concern. The issue is 
then a different forensic perspective of aging. Until very recently, all we 
could do was to tell that the individual was older than 60 years when he/she 
died, which was not very helpful to narrow down the possibilities, since after 
that age, with the increasing longevity, we can have individuals dying at 
seventies, eighties, nineties or even centenarians. Recent research has been 
permitting to do some discrimination among these older age groups. However, more 
research about how the skeletal system ages, a paramount question, is needed. 
While growth and development are programmed strictly by evolution and genetics, 
the same does not apply to adult degeneration process. Hence, not all old 
individuals have old skeletons.All the approaches to adult age estimation only 
produce estimates of age (age groups) with a relatively wide age range, and, the 
older the individuals, the wider is that age range. The perspectives and 
limitations of aging the older are discussed. It is clear that no single 
technique is able to provide an accurate estimation, the key is to use multiple 
methods and, above all, on how to combine them. This last issue has been 
profiting from the application of updated and appropriate mathematical 
techniques. Regarding skeletal age indicators, it is now possible to tell which 
should not be used. The ones to be analysed are also dictated by the state of 
preservation and completeness of the skeletal remains. Some of these skeletal 
age indicators will be commented and the contribution of genetics to this issue 
will also be approached.The relevance of this subject will be illustrated 
through the presentation of some practical forensic cases.

Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy (IECS), Buenos Aires, Argentina.

BACKGROUND: Centrifugal-flow pumps are novel treatment options for patients with 
advanced heart failure (HF). This study estimated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of centrifugal-flow pumps for patients with 
advanced HF in Argentina.
METHODS: Two Markov models were developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
a centrifugal-flow pump as destination therapy (DT) in patients with 
contraindication for heart transplantation, and as bridge-to-transplant (BTT), 
with a lifetime horizon using the third-party payer Social Security (SS) and 
Private Sector (PS) perspectives. Clinical, epidemiological, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) parameters were retrieved from the 
literature. Direct medical costs were estimated through a micro-costing approach 
(exchange rate USD 1 = ARS 59.95).
RESULTS: The centrifugal-flow pump as a DT increased the per patient QALYs by 
3.5 and costs by ARS 8.1 million in both the SS and PS, with an ICER of ARS 2.3 
million per QALY. Corresponding values for a centrifugal-flow pump as BTT were 
0.74 QALYs and more than ARS 8 million, yielding ICERs of ARS 11 million per 
QALY (highly dependent on waiting times). For the 1, 3, and 5 GDP per QALY 
thresholds, the probability of a centrifugal-flow pump to be cost-effective for 
DT/BTT was around 2%/0%, 40%/0%, and 80%/1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The centrifugal-flow pump prolongs life and improves the quality of 
life at significantly higher costs. As in Argentina there is no current explicit 
cost-effectiveness threshold, the final decision on reimbursement will depend on 
the willingness to pay in each subsector. Nevertheless, the centrifugal-flow 
pump as a DT was more cost-effective than as a BTT.

BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) affects four million people worldwide 
annually and has an estimated lifetime prevalence of 5-10% in the general 
population. Worldwide, there are significant heterogeneities in coping 
approaches of healthcare systems with PUD in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, 
and follow-up. Quantifying and benchmarking health systems' performance is 
crucial yet challenging to provide a clearer picture of the potential global 
inequities in the quality of care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the health-system 
quality-of-care and inequities for PUD among age groups and sexes worldwide.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2019. 
Principal-Component-Analysis was used to combine age-standardized 
mortality-to-incidence-ratio, 
disability-adjusted-life-years-to-prevalence-ratio, 
prevalence-to-incidence-ratio, and 
years-of-life-lost-to-years-lived-with-disability-into a single proxy named 
Quality-of-Care-Index (QCI). QCI was used to compare the quality of care among 
countries. QCI's validity was investigated via correlation with the 
cause-specific Healthcare-Access-and-Quality-index, which was acceptable. 
Inequities were presented among age groups and sexes. Gender Disparity Ratio was 
obtained by dividing the score of women by that of men.
RESULTS: Global QCI was 72.6 in 1990, which increased by 14.6% to 83.2 in 2019. 
High-income-Asia-pacific had the highest QCI, while Central Latin America had 
the lowest. QCI of high-SDI countries was 82.9 in 1990, which increased to 92.9 
in 2019. The QCI of low-SDI countries was 65.0 in 1990, which increased to 76.9 
in 2019. There was heterogeneity among the QCI-level of countries with the same 
SDI level. QCI typically decreased as people aged; however, this gap was more 
significant among low-SDI countries. The global Gender Disparity Ratio was close 
to one and ranged from 0.97 to 1.03 in 100 of 204 countries.
CONCLUSION: QCI of PUD improved dramatically during 1990-2019 worldwide. There 
are still significant heterogeneities among countries on different and similar 
SDI levels.

Socioeconomic gaps in life expectancy have widened substantially in the United 
States since 2000. Yet the contribution of specific causes to these growing 
disparities remains unknown. We used death records from the National Vital 
Statistics System and population data from Current Population Surveys to 
quantify the contribution of alcohol-attributable causes of death to changes in 
US life expectancy between 2000 and 2018 by sex and socioeconomic status (as 
measured by educational attainment). During the study period, the gap in life 
expectancy between people with low (high school diploma or less) compared with 
high (college degree) levels of education increased by three years among men and 
five years among women. Between 2000 and 2010 declines in cardiovascular disease 
mortality among people with high education made major contributions to growing 
inequalities. In contrast, between 2010 and 2018 deaths from a cause with an 
alcohol-attributable fraction of 20 percent or more were a dominant driver of 
socioeconomic divergence. Increased efforts to implement cost-effective alcohol 
control policies will be essential for reducing health disparities.

Allium cepa (onion) and Allium sativum (garlic) are important members of the 
Amaryllidaceae (Alliaceae) family and are being used both as food and medicine 
for centuries in different parts of the world. Polysaccharides have been 
extracted from different parts of onion and garlic such as bulb, straw and cell 
wall. The current literature portrays several studies on the extraction of 
polysaccharides from onion and garlic, their modification and determination of 
their structural (molecular weight, monosaccharide unit and their arrangement, 
type and position of glycosidic bond or linkage, degree of polymerization, chain 
conformation) and functional properties (emulsifying property, moisture 
retention, hygroscopicity, thermal stability, foaming ability, fat-binding 
capacity). In this line, this review, summarizes the various extraction 
techniques used for polysaccharides from onion and garlic, involving methods 
like solvent extraction method. Furthermore, the antioxidant, anticancer, 
immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties 
of onion and garlic polysaccharides as reported in in vivo and in vitro studies 
are also critically assessed in this review. Different studies have proved onion 
and garlic polysaccharides as potential antioxidant and immunomodulatory agent. 
Studies have implemented to improve the functionality of onion and garlic 
polysaccharides through various modification approaches. Further studies are 
warranted for utilizing onion and garlic polysaccharides in the food, 
nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is the anthropophilic 
and day-biter mosquito, residing in peridomestic habitats and is responsible for 
vector-borne diseases, i.e., chikungunya and dengue. The knowledge of mosquito 
life demographics is very important to provide a foundation for a successful 
vector control program. In the present study, a comparative adult life table, 
survival, and fecundity parameters were evaluated on desert (Jodhpur, Rajasthan) 
and coastal (Kolkata, West Bengal) strains of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: 
Culicidae) from India under the standard laboratory conditions. The results 
showed significant differences between these strains for the life expectancy of 
males, fecundity (total eggs/cohort and eggs/female life span), oviposition 
days, intrinsic rate of increase (rm), finite rate of increase (λ), and doubling 
time (DT). Female mosquitoes lived longer than the males in both strains. 
Significant differences were observed in the net reproductive rate (R0) between 
Kolkata and Jodhpur strains. The coastal (Kolkata) strain showed a longer male 
life expectancy (5.6 days) than the desert strain (4.0 days). However, the 
fecundity (eggs/female lifespan) was higher in Kolkata (360.2) than the Jodhpur 
strain (229.7). The Kolkata strain showed higher R0, rm, λ, and the lower T, DT 
than the Jodhpur strain. Conclusively, the results indicate that the coastal 
strain of Ae. albopictus is more r-strategist than the desert strain. This study 
may help in the precise prediction of Ae. albopictus population dynamics 
surviving in these geographical areas for vector management.

Ovophis makazayazaya bite is an uncommon cause of snakebite that humans may 
sustain as a result of the continuous overexploitation of forest habitats and 
excessive development in Taiwan. Although the Taiwanese government has produced 
four antivenoms against medically important snakebite accidents, O. makazayazaya 
is not among the snakes for which an antivenom has been produced. A case of O. 
makazayazaya snakebite on a patient's right foot, which later swelled into the 
hip, is reported. In vitro studies have reported that monovalent antivenoms for 
Gloydius brevicaudus and Trimeresurus albolabris, and polyvalent antivenom for 
Calloselasma rhodostoma, Daboia siamensis, and T. albolabris show reactivity 
toward Ovophis venoms. However, these antivenoms are unavailable in Taiwan. 
Thus, bivalent antivenom for Trimeresurus stejnegeri stejnegeri and 
Protobothrops mucrosquamatus was used, assuming similar immunoreactivity and a 
possible para-specific effect of green pit viper antivenom against this Ovophis 
venom. A favorable outcome was observed, without significant extension in 
prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. In addition, no 
systemic bleeding occurred. Nonetheless, further venom and antivenom evaluations 
should ascertain the efficacy of this para-specific antivenoms against this 
crotaline snakebite.

BACKGROUND: Patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 
are at high risk of incident cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke. Despite 
compelling evidence about the efficacy of secondary prevention, a substantial 
gap exists between risk factor management in real life and that recommended by 
international guidelines. We conducted the STROKE-CARD trial (NCT02156778), a 
multifaceted pragmatic disease management program between 2014 and 2018 with 
follow-up until 2019. This program successfully reduced cardiovascular risk and 
improved health-related quality of life and functional outcome in patients with 
acute ischaemic stroke or TIA within 12 months after the index event. To 
investigate potential long-term effects of STROKE-CARD care compared to standard 
care, an extension of follow-up is warranted.
METHODS: We aim to include all patients from the STROKE-CARD trial (n = 2149) 
for long-term follow-up between 2019 and 2021 with the study visit scheduled 
3-6 years after the stroke/TIA event. The co-primary endpoint is the composite 
of major recurrent cardiovascular events (nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, and vascular death) from hospital discharge until the long-term 
follow-up visit and health-related quality of life measured with the European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) at the final visit. Secondary endpoints 
include overall mortality, long-term functional outcome, and target-level 
achievement in risk factor management.
DISCUSSION: This long-term follow-up will provide evidence on whether the 
pragmatic post-stroke/TIA intervention program STROKE-CARD is capable of 
preventing recurrent cardiovascular events and improving quality-of-life in the 
long run. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04205006 on 19 December 
2019.

BACKGROUND: Avian haemosporidia infect both domestic and wild birds, causing 
anemia, acute tissue degeneration, and depopulation in wild birds. Poultry and 
wild birds have been reported as common reservoirs of haemosporidia, but limited 
information is available for red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) in China. The 
present study investigated the prevalence and molecular characterization of 
haemosporidia in red junglefowl.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 234 red junglefowl from Jinghong City 
of Yunnan Province, and genomic DNA was extracted from these samples. The 
prevalence of haemosporidia was determined by nested PCR targeting the 
mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. Molecular characterization was 
investigated based on phylogenetic analysis of cytb sequences, and associated 
risk factors were analyzed using the Chi-square (χ2) test.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of haemosporidia was 74.8% (175/234), and three 
species were identified, namely Haemoproteus enucleator, Leucocytozoon 
californicus, and Plasmodium juxtanucleare. The prevalence of haemosporidia in 
adult fowl (81.1%, 107/132) was significantly higher (χ2 = 6.32, df = 1, 
P = 0.012) than that in juveniles (66.7%, 68/102). Three novel haemosporidian 
lineages were revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the prevalence and identified species of avian 
haemosporidians in red junglefowl, providing new information on the molecular 
epidemiology and geographical distribution of haemosporidian parasites. Our 
results indicated high prevalence and diverse species distribution of these 
haemosporidians in red junglefowl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first record of haemosporidian infection in red junglefowl in China.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption increased in the early phases of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and risky 
drinking are linked to harmful health effects. This paper aimed to project 
future health and cost impacts of shifts in alcohol consumption during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: An individual-level simulation model of the long-term drinking patterns 
for people with life-time AUD was used to simulate 10 000 individuals and 
project model outcomes to the estimated 25.9 million current drinkers with 
life-time AUD in the United States. The model considered three scenarios: (1) no 
change (counterfactual for comparison); (2) increased drinking levels persist 
for 1 year ('increase-1') and (3) increased drinking levels persist for 5 years 
('increase-5').
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Current drinkers with life-time AUD.
MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy [life-years (LYs)], quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), alcohol-related hospitalizations and associated hospitalization costs 
and alcohol-related deaths, during a 5-year period.
FINDINGS: Short-term increases in alcohol consumption (increase-1 scenario) 
resulted in a loss of 79 000 [95% uncertainty interval (UI]) 26 000-201 000] 
LYs, a loss of 332 000 (104 000-604 000) QALYs and 295 000 (82 000-501 000) more 
alcohol-related hospitalizations, costing an additional $5.4 billion ($1.5-9.3 
billion) over 5 years. Hospitalizations for cirrhosis of the liver accounted for 
approximately $3.0 billion ($0.9-4.8 billion) in hospitalization costs, more 
than half the increase across all alcohol-related conditions. Health and cost 
impacts were more pronounced for older age groups (51+), women and non-Hispanic 
black individuals. Increasing the duration of pandemic-driven increases in 
alcohol consumption in the increase-5 scenario resulted in larger impacts.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulations show that if the increase in alcohol consumption 
observed in the United States in the first year of the pandemic continues, 
alcohol-related mortality, morbidity and associated costs will increase 
substantially over the next 5 years.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of an ageing simulation 
intervention on qualified acute care nurses' empathy towards older people.
BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing globally with an increased incidence 
of older people accessing healthcare services. As such, it is essential for 
qualified nurses within hospital settings to connect with older people by 
establishing healthful relationships. Empathy is an essential component of 
healthful nurse-patient relationships. Fortunately, empathy can be taught 
through education.
DESIGN: A convergent mixed-methods design was utilised.
METHODS: Nurses (N = 95) undertook an 8-hour ageing simulation intervention. 
Data were collected from April 2019 to May 2020 across three time points: before 
the intervention (T0); immediately after (T1) and at three months follow-up 
(T2). A mix of convenience (intervention) and purposeful (follow-up) sampling 
techniques were utilised. Quantitative data were collected via the Interpersonal 
Reactivity Index survey (n = 86) and analysed using repeat measures ANOVA to 
compare mean scores across time points. Qualitative data were collected via 
debriefing discussions (N = 95) and focus groups (n = 38), and analysed using a 
systematic thematic analysis method. Data convergence occurred during the 
interpretation phase. Study reported with the TREND checklist.
RESULTS: Primarily, when quantitative and qualitative findings were merged they 
confirmed each others' empathy outcomes. Quantitative results showed a 
statistically significant increase in affective and cognitive empathy levels 
among nurses post-intervention. Qualitative findings expanded on quantitative 
results and revealed an increase in nurses' affective, cognitive and behavioural 
empathy represented in themes 'enhancing my empathy', 'impact of ageing', 'from 
self to others' and 'person-centred moments'.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds empirical evidence how a mixed-methods design can 
be used to evaluate the influence of an ageing simulation intervention on 
nurses' empathy levels.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Ageing simulation interventions are a suitable 
experiential educational approach to improve acute care nurses' affective, 
cognitive and behavioural empathy towards older people.

Heparin is a subject of ever-growing interest for laboratory researchers and 
pharmaceutical industry. One of the driving factors is its critical life-saving 
drug status, which during the COVID-19 pandemic has assumed a central role in 
disease treatment and/or prevention. Apart, heparin is one amongst few drugs 
enjoying a "demand constant" status. In 2020, heparin market size was valued to 
US$6.5 bn., and given the ongoing stability in the COVID-19 health crisis, it is 
expected to reach US$11.43 bn. by 2027 with yearly growth rate momentum (CAGR) 
of 3.9% during the forecast period (Pepi et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 20:100,025, 
2021). As patent is a limited monopoly, every year, many patents on low 
molecular weight heparin (LMWH; a chemically or enzymatically degraded product 
of unfractionated heparin) are losing market exclusivity worldwide, inviting the 
generic/biosimilar drug manufacturers to capture market share with cheaper drug 
products. By tracking patent expiration, drugs in patent litigation, regulatory 
setbacks for innovator companies (such as those seeking data exclusivity or 
patent term extension), or other unexpected events affecting market demand and 
competition, generics can make investment decisions in manufacturing off-patent 
LMWH drug products of commercial significance. However, given the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), Drug Regulatory 
Authority of Pakistan (DRAP), and other regulatory authorities scientifically 
rigorous standards for generic/biosimilar LMWH drug products marketing approval, 
the market is secured and momentous for drug makers that could demonstrate 
through scientific and clinical dataset that the generic/biosimilar LMWH drug 
product is of the same quality and purity as the innovator drug product. This 
study presents an overview of the patent landscape of commercially available 
LMWHs and advanced analytical techniques for their structural and biochemical 
characterization for quality control and quality assurance during manufacturing 
and post-marketing. The study also covers FDA, EMA, Health Canada, and DRAP's 
current approaches to evaluating the generic/biosimilar LMWH drug products for 
quality, safety including immunogenicity, and efficacy.
