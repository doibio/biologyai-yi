RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a lower number of steps per day correlated 
with older age, male sex, higher body mass index, higher lesion level, use of 
assistive devices for ambulation, history of shunt placement, more television 
(TV) watched per week, lower hip extension and abduction strength, knee flexion 
strength, and ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength, and decreased knee 
and hip range of motion. Only assistive device usage and hours of TV watched per 
week remained in the final multivariate model predicting number of steps per 
day.
CONCLUSIONS: Walking activity in children and adolescents with MMC was best 
predicted by assistive device use and amount of sedentary activity. Other 
predictors of walking activity from univariate analysis were related to 
assistive device use. This information can help tailor rehabilitation efforts 
and educate patients and families. Interventions targeting early prevention of 
strength loss and contractures may be important to retain or increase walking 
activity in children and adolescents with MMC.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized 
by an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). If left 
untreated, an accumulation of Phe results in neurodevelopmental, neurological 
and psychological impairments. Advancements in detection and treatment of PKU 
have improved outcomes and life expectancy for these patients, emphasizing the 
need for life-long, specialized care. Due to the paucity of adult-focused PKU 
clinics, patients who are well into adulthood are still being treated in 
pediatric centers. This retrospective study evaluates the perceived 
expectations, benefits and challenges of 50 adult PKU patients (mean age 
31.3 ± 10.4 years) transitioning from a pediatric to adult care setting using a 
transition questionnaire administered at the first clinic visit at the adult PKU 
care center. Patients reported a lack of access to adult resources and 
adult-specific PKU educational material in their pediatric PKU clinic. In 
contrast, the established relationships with the pediatric health care team and 
familiarity with treatment plans were aspects of pediatric care that patients 
enjoyed. The results from this study will contribute to the optimization of 
adult PKU patient care, establishment of strategies for transitioning adults 
with PKU and other metabolic disorders from pediatric to adult care, and support 
the need to establish adult-only PKU care facilities.

Using information on ART costs and benefits to mobilise resources - comparing 
different methods and contexts.

Africa.

Sustaining HIV and AIDS responses depends on a mix of donor, government and 
private funders. Their decisions about investing in HIV treatment may be 
informed by various types of economic evaluations, which may be more or less 
useful for different contexts. This paper benchmarks methods against each other. 
Epidemiological and demographic impacts of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
from 1996-2015 were quantified using country- specific spectrum files. The study 
compared societal benefits of ART using the full income (FI) methodology with 
"conventional" benefit, utility and effectiveness estimates produced with the 
same data. The FI estimates suggested $3.50 in benefits per dollar spent on ART 
globally, 2.6 times larger than productivity-related measures of benefits, of 
$1.33 in benefits per dollar. Higher benefit-cost ratios are mainly because FI 
reflects value of life beyond what people produce at work and in non-working age 
groups, and allocates the future stream of benefits in the year that death is 
avoided. ART costs were 0.78 times per capita GDP per quality-adjusted 
life-years gained globally. FI benefit-cost ratios are considerably higher in 
upper- and lower-middle-income countries than in low- or high-income countries. 
Productivity-based benefits also exceeded costs in all but one region but had 
smaller ratios and different regional patterns. Per capita GDP per 
quality-adjusted life-years ratios were below 1.2 for all regions and country 
income bands, suggesting cost effectiveness. The fact that FI returns of ART are 
higher than productivity returns, helps to quantify developmental benefits of 
interventions that directly extend life and its quality, arguably the objective 
of development. They provide an important argument to increase budget 
allocations to health sectors for ART scale-up, and not just reallocate existing 
health resources. Benchmarking FI returns against cost per quality- adjusted 
life-years may allow comparison to other "cost effective" health interventions. 
However, caution should be taken in extrapolations between measures, because 
they produce different rankings across country categories.

BACKGROUND: Combined with the increasing life expectancy, chronic medical 
conditions have gradually become the dominant cause of death and disability, and 
multimorbidity became an increasingly serious public health challenge. However, 
most existing studies have focused on the coexistence of specific diseases or 
relatively few diseases. Given one person may have multiple diseases at the same 
time, we applied Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to systematically evaluate 
one's 10-year mortality. In this study, we explored the effects of nutrients and 
physical activity on CCI using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 2013-2014 data.
METHODS: The study sample consists of one continuous cycle (2013-2014) of 
NHANES, and 4386 subjects were included in the study. Nutrients intake was 
measured by dietary recall, and physical activity was evaluated by the Global 
Physical Activity Questionnaire respectively. Besides, CCI was the sum of the 
scores assigned for each medical condition. We utilized zero-inflated negative 
binomial (ZINB) model to investigate the effects in nutrients intake and 
physical activity on CCI by adjusting for seven sociodemographic 
characteristics, smoking and drinking.
RESULTS: Among the 4386 participants, 2018 (68.7%) are Non-Hispanic White, over 
half participants (78.6%) drink. In count part (CCI ≥ 0), holding other 
variables constant, the expected change in CCI for a one-unit increase in niacin 
is 1.621(RR = 1.621, p = 0.016), in lutein + zeaxanthin is 0.974 (RR = 0.974, 
p = 0.031), and in sedentary time is 1.035 (RR = 1.035, p = 0.005). Moreover, 
those who do not have vigorous work activity would be more likely to have higher 
CCI than those who have (RR = 1.275, P = 0.045). In logit part (CCI = 0), the 
log odds of having CCI equals zero would increase by 0.541 and 0.708 for every 
additional vigorous recreational activity (OR = 0.541, p = 0.004) and moderate 
recreational activity (OR = 0.708, p = 0.017) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Lutein and zeaxanthin intake, vigorous work activity, vigorous 
recreational activity and moderate recreational activity may be good for one's 
health. Rather, increasing niacin intake and sedentary activity may be likely to 
raise 10-year mortality. Our findings may be significant for preventing diseases 
and improving health, furthermore, reducing people's financial burden on 
healthcare.

Valencia, Spain.

Angiosarcomas constitute less than 1% of primary bone malignancies. Their 
association with prosthetic material has been described, while their etiology 
remains unclear. We present a case of a 64-year woman with severe bleeding and 
hip joint osteolysis after an accidental fall. She had undergone prosthetic 
total hip arthroplasty many years back. The rapid recurrence of pelvic hematoma 
and the refractory infection of pelvic cavity made necessary to disarticulate 
the prosthetic hip joint, after several attempts to apply conservative 
treatment. Despite supportive treatment, she died. Autopsy revealed evidently 
dissemanted angiosarcoma of pelvic bones. Angiosarcoma of the bone should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with uncontrollable 
bleeding and osteolysis, due to the increase of life expectancy when prompt and 
combined treatment is initiated.

BACKGROUND: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches have gained popularity 
in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of 
acceptance- and mindfulness-based therapies for persons with a psychotic or 
schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant databases were searched for 
published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2018. Outcomes were 
severity of overall symptomatology, hospitalization, positive and negative 
symptoms, depression, anxiety, social functioning, quality of life, acceptance, 
mindfulness skills and safety of the interventions.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies comprising 1268 people with a schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder were included in the meta-analyses. Moderate to large effect sizes were 
found for overall symptomatology and hospitalization at endpoint (SMD .80, 95% 
CI -1.31, -0.29 and MD 4.38, -5.58, -3.17 respectively) and follow-up (SMD 1.10, 
-2.09, -0.10 and MD 7.18, -8.67, - 5.68 respectively). There were significant 
small effects on negative symptoms (SMD .24; -0.44, -0.03), small to moderate 
effects for depression (SMD .47; -0.80, -0.14), social functioning (SMD .43; 
-0.75, - 0.12) and mindfulness (SMD .51; -0.97, -0.05), moderate to large 
effects for acceptance (SMD .78; -1.44, -0.12), while no significant effects for 
positive symptoms (SMD .27; -0.65, 0.00), anxiety (SMD 2.11; -4.64, 0.42) or 
quality of life (SMD .43; -0.88, 0.02). Majority of studies (75%) had low risk 
of bias and sensitivity analyses supported the findings.
CONCLUSION: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches appear to be effective 
and safe interventions for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 
could be a useful extension of standard casemanagement and psychofarmacology.

OBJECTIVE: Report experience of patients undergoing surgery for resection of 
renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena cava invasion and use of transesophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE).
DESIGN: Retrospective and observational study.
SETTING: Single large university hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 55 consecutive who underwent resection of 
renal cell carcinoma.
INTERVENTIONS: A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed by cardiac 
anesthesiologists in high grade tumors.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had tumor thrombi classified 
as level III, and 6 patients were classified as level IV. There was increased 
use of TEE for higher level of tumor thrombi.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical management of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena 
cava tumor extension is complex. High-grade tumors require individualized 
treatment. Successful outcomes require collaboration between surgeons and 
anesthesiologists. Patients with level IIIb to IV tumor invasion benefit from 
TEE assessment and monitoring, which may be life-saving, and cardiac anesthesia 
should be involved in those types of cases.

Due to an increasing number of older adults with (risk factors for) 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), the sum of older adults eligible for 
lipid-lowering drugs will increase. This has risen questions about benefits and 
harms of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults with a varying number of 
(cardiovascular) comorbidities and functional status. The heterogeneity in 
physical and functional health increases with age, leading to a much wider 
variety in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy than in younger adults. We 
suggest treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥75 years 
should shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a 
patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach. With this, estimated 
10-year risk of CVD should be placed into the perspective of life expectancy. 
Moreover, frailty and safety concerns must be taken into account for a 
risk-benefit discussion between clinician and patient. Based on the Dutch 
addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management in (frail) older adults', our approach 
offers more detailed information on when not to initiate or deprescribe therapy 
than standard guidelines. Instead of using traditional risk estimating tools 
which tend to overestimate risk of CVD in older adults, use a competing risk 
adjusted, older adults-specific risk score (available at https://u-prevent.com). 
By filling in a patient's (cardiovascular) health profile (eg, cholesterol, 
renal function), the tool estimates risk of CVD and models the effect of 
medication in terms of absolute risk reduction for an individual patient. Using 
this tool can guide doctors and patients in making shared decisions on 
initiating, continuing or deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent relapses 
of affective episodes, cognitive impairment, illness progression, and reduced 
life expectancy. Increased systemic oxidatively generated nucleoside damage have 
been found in some neurodegenerative disorders and in BD. As the first, this 
naturalistic prospective, longitudinal follow-up case-control study investigated 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oxidative stress markers 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine 
(8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) that relate to RNA 
and DNA damage, respectively. Patients with BD (n = 86, 51% female) and 
gender-and-age-matched healthy control individuals (HC; n = 44, 44% female) were 
evaluated at baseline (T0), during (T1) and after a new affective episode (T2), 
if it occurred, and after a year (T3). Cerebrospinal and urine oxidative stress 
markers were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry. CSF-8-oxoGuo was statistically significantly higher by 18% 
(p = 0.003) in BD versus HC at T0, and by 22% (p = 0) at T3. CSF-8-oxoGuo had 
increased by 15% (p = 0.042) from T0 to T3, and by 14% (p = 0.021) from T2 to T3 
in patients, who experienced an episode during follow-up. CSF-8-oxodG had 
increased by 26% (p = 0.054) from T0 to T2 and decreased by 19% (p = 0.041) from 
T2 to T3 in patients, who experienced an episode during follow-up. CSF-8-oxoGuo 
did not show a statistically significant change in HC during the one-year 
follow-up. CSF and urine-8-oxoGuo levels correlated moderately. In conclusion, 
CSF oxidative stress marker of RNA damage 8-oxoGuo showed both state and trait 
dependence in BD and stability in HC. Central RNA damage may be a potential 
biomarker for BD.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the principal cause of death and disability in 
children and young adults. Clinical and preclinical research efforts have been 
carried out to understand the acute, life-threatening pathophysiological events 
happening after TBI. In the past few years, however, it was recognized that TBI 
causes significant morbidity weeks, months, or years after the initial injury, 
thereby contributing substantially to the overall burden of TBI and the decrease 
of life expectancy in these patients. Long-lasting sequels of TBI include 
cognitive decline/dementia, sensory-motor dysfunction, and psychiatric 
disorders, and most important for patients is the need for socio-economic 
rehabilitation affecting their quality of life. Cerebrovascular alterations have 
been described during the first week after TBI for direct consequence 
development of neuroinflammatory process in relation to brain edema. Within the 
brain-immune interactions, the complement system, which is a family of blood and 
cell surface proteins, participates in the pathophysiology process. In fact, the 
complement system is part of the primary defense and clearance component of 
innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, the complement activation 
after TBI will be described in relation to the activation of the microglia and 
astrocytes as well as the blood-brain barrier dysfunction during the first week 
after the injury. Considering the neuroinflammatory activity as a causal element 
of neurological handicaps, some major parallel lines of complement activity in 
multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer pathologies with regard to cognitive impairment 
will be discussed for chronic TBI. A better understanding of the role of 
complement activation could facilitate the development of new therapeutic 
approaches for TBI.

Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most of the patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It improves quality of life, life expectancy, 
and has a lower financial burden to the healthcare system in comparison to 
dialysis. Every year more and more older patients are included in the kidney 
transplant waitlist. Within this patient population, transplanted subjects have 
better survival and quality of life as compared to those on dialysis. It is 
therefore crucial to select older patients who may benefit from renal 
transplantation, as well as those particularly at risk for post-transplant 
complications. Sarcopenia and frailty are frequently neglected in the evaluation 
of kidney transplant candidates. Both conditions are interrelated complex 
geriatric syndromes that are linked to disability, aging, comorbidities, 
increased mortality, and graft failure post-transplantation. Chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and more importantly ESRD are characterized by multiple metabolic 
complications that contribute for the development of sarcopenia and frailty. In 
particular, anorexia, metabolic acidosis and chronic low-grade inflammation are 
the main contributors to the development of sarcopenia, a key component in frail 
transplant candidates and recipients. Both frailty and sarcopenia are considered 
to be reversible. Frail patients respond well to multiprofessional interventions 
that focus on the patients' positive frailty criteria, while physical 
rehabilitation and oral supplementation may improve sarcopenia. Prospective 
studies are still needed to evaluate the utility of formally measuring frailty 
and sarcopenia in the older candidates to renal transplantation as part of the 
transplant evaluation process.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential impact of reduced tobacco use 
scenarios on total life expectancy and health expectancies, i.e., healthy life 
years and unhealthy life years.
METHODS: Data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey 2013 were used to 
estimate smoking and disability prevalence. Disability was based on the Global 
Activity Limitation Indicator. We used DYNAMO-HIA to quantify the impacts of 
risk factor changes and to compare the "business-as-usual" with alternative 
scenarios.
RESULTS: The "business-as-usual" scenario estimated that in 2028 the 15-year-old 
men/women would live additional 50/52 years without disability and 14/17 years 
with disability. The "smoking-free population" scenario added 3.4/2.8 healthy 
life years and reduced unhealthy life years by 0.79/1.9. Scenarios combining the 
prevention of smoking initiation with smoking cessation programs are the most 
effective, yielding the largest increase in healthy life years (1.9/1.7) and the 
largest decrease in unhealthy life years (- 0.80/- 1.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Health impact assessment tools provide different scenarios for 
evidence-informed public health actions. New anti-smoking strategies or stricter 
enforcement of existing policies potentially gain more healthy life years and 
reduce unhealthy life years in Belgium.

Plant beneficial rhizobacteria (PBR) is a group of naturally occurring 
rhizospheric microbes that enhance nutrient availability and induce biotic and 
abiotic stress tolerance through a wide array of mechanisms to enhance 
agricultural sustainability. Application of PBR has the potential to reduce 
worldwide requirement of agricultural chemicals and improve agro-ecological 
sustainability. The PBR exert their beneficial effects in three major ways; (1) 
fix atmospheric nitrogen and synthesize specific compounds to promote plant 
growth, (2) solubilize essential mineral nutrients in soils for plant uptake, 
and (3) produce antimicrobial substances and induce systemic resistance in host 
plants to protect them from biotic and abiotic stresses. Application of PBR as 
suitable inoculants appears to be a viable alternative technology to synthetic 
fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, PBR enhance nutrient and water use 
efficiency, influence dynamics of mineral recycling, and tolerance of plants to 
other environmental stresses by improving health of soils. This report provides 
comprehensive reviews and discusses beneficial effects of PBR on plant and soil 
health. Considering their multitude of functions to improve plant and soil 
health, we propose to call the plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPR) as PBR.

There is an extensive body of empirical research that focuses on the societal 
monetary value of a quality-adjusted life year (MVQALY). Many of these studies 
have found the estimates to be inversely associated with the size of the health 
gain, and thus not conforming to the linearity assumption imposed in the QALY 
model. In this study, we explore the extent to which the MVQALY varies when it 
is associated with different types and magnitudes of quality of life (QoL) 
improvements. To allow for a comprehensive assessment, we derive the MVQALY 
corresponding to the full spectrum of health gains defined by the EQ-5D-3L 
instrument. The analysis was based on a large and representative sample of the 
population in Spain. A discrete choice experiment and a time trade-off exercise 
were used to derive a value set for utilities, followed by a willingness to pay 
questionnaire. The data were jointly analysed using regression analyses and 
bootstrapping techniques. Our findings indicate that societal values for a QALY 
corresponding to different EQ-5D-3L health gains vary approximately between 
10,000€ and 30,000€. MVQALY associated with larger improvements on QoL was found 
to be lower than that associated with moderate QoL gains. The potential sources 
of the observed non-constant MVQALY are discussed.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy and recent advancements in 
technology and medical science have changed the way we deliver health services 
to the aging societies. Evidence suggests that home telemonitoring can 
significantly decrease the number of readmissions, and continuous monitoring of 
older adults' daily activities and health-related issues might prevent medical 
emergencies.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to identify advances in 
assistive technology devices for seniors and aging-in-place technology and to 
determine the level of evidence for research on remote patient monitoring, smart 
homes, telecare, and artificially intelligent monitoring systems.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted using Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature Plus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers Xplore, ProQuest Central, Scopus, and Science Direct. 
Publications related to older people's care, independent living, and novel 
assistive technologies were included in the study.
RESULTS: A total of 91 publications met the inclusion criteria. In total, four 
themes emerged from the data: technology acceptance and readiness, novel patient 
monitoring and smart home technologies, intelligent algorithm and software 
engineering, and robotics technologies. The results revealed that most studies 
had poor reference standards without an explicit critical appraisal.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ubiquitous in-home monitoring and smart technologies for 
aged people's care will increase their independence and the health care services 
available to them as well as improve frail elderly people's health care 
outcomes. This review identified four different themes that require different 
conceptual approaches to solution development. Although the engineering teams 
were focused on prototype and algorithm development, the medical science teams 
were concentrated on outcome research. We also identified the need to develop 
custom technology solutions for different aging societies. The convergence of 
medicine and informatics could lead to the development of new interdisciplinary 
research models and new assistive products for the care of older adults.

Advances in treatment and care have improved the life expectancy and quality of 
life for people living with HIV. However, those infected with HIV remain exposed 
to the social stigma that continues to be associated with this condition and 
sometimes experience discriminatory treatment in areas such as health, 
education, the judiciary or the workplace, and in access to benefits and 
insurance. There is a lot of evidence that the discrimination and stigma 
associated with HIV alienate people from prevention, diagnosis, treatment and 
quality of life services. This situation is exacerbated by social, economic and 
cultural status, as social and structural inequity facilitates increased 
discrimination and unfair treatment in the daily lives of people living with 
HIV. In response to this situation arises the need to establish a Social Pact 
for Non-Discrimination and Equal Treatment Associated with HIV, agreed and 
signed by social and institutional agents key in the response to HIV. Its aim is 
to eliminate the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, 
ensuring equal treatment and opportunities, non-discrimination, respect for 
fundamental rights and diversity of those affected. Reducing discrimination 
against people living with HIV is one of the priority objectives of the Ministry 
of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare's Strategic Plan for the 
Prevention and Control of HIV and other STIs, currently extended to 2020. It is 
aligned with the UNAIDS cross-cutting objective of zero discrimination and with 
the fourth objective of the 90-90-90-90 strategy, which should ensure that 90% 
of people with HIV and viral load suppression have a good health-related quality 
of life.

Publisher: Los avances en nuevos tratamientos y en la atención sanitaria han 
mejorado la esperanza y la calidad de vida de las personas con el VIH. Sin 
embargo, quienes tienen esta infección siguen expuestos al estigma social que 
sigue asociándose a esta condición, experimentando en ocasiones un trato 
discriminatorio en ámbitos como el sanitario, el educativo, el judicial o el 
laboral, así como en el acceso a prestaciones y seguros. Existen numerosos datos 
que muestran que la discriminación y el estigma asociados al VIH alejan a las 
personas de los servicios de prevención, diagnóstico, tratamiento y calidad de 
vida. Esta situación se acentúa según la posición social, económica y cultural, 
ya que la inequidad social y estructural facilita el aumento de la 
discriminación y del trato injusto en la vida diaria de las personas con el VIH. 
Como respuesta a esta situación surge la necesidad de establecer un Pacto Social 
por la No Discriminación y la Igualdad de Trato Asociada al VIH, consensuado y 
suscrito por los agentes sociales e institucionales claves en la respuesta 
frente al VIH. Su objetivo es eliminar el estigma y la discriminación asociados 
al VIH y al Sida, garantizando la igualdad de trato y de oportunidades, la no 
discriminación, el respeto de los derechos fundamentales y la diversidad de las 
personas afectadas. Disminuir la discriminación hacia las personas con el VIH es 
uno de los objetivos prioritarios del Plan Estratégico de Prevención y Control 
del VIH y otras ITS, del Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, 
actualmente prorrogado hasta 2020. Está alineado con el objetivo transversal de 
cero discriminación de ONUSIDA y con el cuarto objetivo de la estrategia 
90-90-90-90, en el que se debería de asegurar que el 90% de las personas con el 
VIH y supresión de carga viral tengan una buena calidad de vida relacionada con 
la salud.

Cystic fibrosis in Canadian Hutterites.

Pasterkamp H(1), Menzies KJ(1), Bayomi DJ(1).

Canada.

BACKGROUND: The Hutterite Brethren are a communal group of Anabaptists who live 
in the Western regions of North America, predominantly in the Western Canadian 
provinces. Due to a founder effect, Hutterites have a high rate of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) with genotypes limited to only two CFTR mutations. One-third of 
Hutterite patients with CF are pancreatic sufficient. Previously we found an 
unexplained younger age at death in Hutterites compared with nonHutterites 
homozygous for the common F508del mutation. The present study expanded the data 
collection and analysis for confirmation and further exploration.
METHODS: Anonymized information, based on Hutterite surnames, was extracted from 
the Canadian CF Registry. Summary data on nonHutterite patients with CF 
homozygous for F508del served as control. Statistical analyses explored the 
effects of genotype within Hutterites and compared nutritional status, lung 
function, and microbiologic findings between the groups.
RESULTS: The younger average age at death in Hutterites compared with controls 
was confirmed, but there was no suggestion of a generally shortened life 
expectancy. While the nutritional status in Hutterite children was better than 
that of controls, their lung function was slightly but significantly lower. 
Staphylococcus aureus was more frequent in Hutterites while there was no 
difference between the groups regarding Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite less pancreatic insufficiency, better nutrition, communal 
life in socioeconomic stability, and without exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke, the clinical course of CF appears to be more severe in a significant 
number of Hutterites. Investigations of gene-environment interactions and of CF 
disease gene modifiers may help to explain this conundrum.

INTRODUCTION: With medical advances, the life expectancy of people living with 
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has improved; however, tobacco use remains a prominent risk for 
mortality. Although studies have examined the efficacy of varenicline for 
treating smoking among PLWHA, the relationship between varenicline adherence and 
cessation and correlates of varenicline adherence remain under-studied.
METHODS: We conducted secondary analyses from a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial of varenicline for smoking among PLWHA, using data from participants who 
received varenicline (N = 89). The relationship between varenicline adherence 
(based on pill count) and end-of-treatment smoking cessation was assessed, as 
were correlates of varenicline adherence.
RESULTS: Those who were abstinent took an average of 137.1 pills (SD = 39.3), or 
83% of pills prescribed, vs. 105.3 pills (SD = 64.1), or 64%, for those who were 
smoking (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.001-1.021, p = 0.03); 52/89 (58%) participants 
were adherent based on taking ≥80% of pills. The quit rate for adherent 
participants was 35% (18/52) vs. 19% (7/37) for non-adherent participants. 
Adherent participants were older, smoked fewer cigarettes each day, started 
smoking at an older age, and had lower baseline creatinine vs. non-adherent 
participants (p < 0.05). There was a significant time-by-group interaction 
effect for anxiety (F[1,72] = 6.24, p = 0.02), depression (F[1,72] = 4.2, 
p = 0.04), and insomnia (F[1,72] = 7.73, p = 0.007), indicating that adherent 
participants had less depression, anxiety, and insomnia during the initial weeks 
of treatment, vs. non-adherent participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of varenicline adherence for 
determining cessation and highlight the role of early changes in anxiety, 
depression, and insomnia determining varenicline adherence.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clustering of behavioral health risk 
factors (HRFs), namely the occurrence of 16 specific combinations of tobacco 
smoking, at-risk alcohol use, overweight and physical inactivity in general 
hospital patients. Furthermore, social inequalities in HRFs, health and life 
expectancy are a major concern in public health. In order to establish the need 
for screening and intervention in general hospital care, the study aimed to 
determine the co-occurrence of HRFs in patients in four medical departments, and 
to investigate differences by gender, age and socio-economic characteristics.
METHODS: Over 17 months, a systematic multiple HRF screening was conducted at 
one general hospital in northeastern Germany. In total, 6251 18-64 year old 
patients (92% of eligibles) participated. Proportions and confidence intervals 
were calculated for all 16 HRF profiles stratified by department, gender, age 
group, school education, and employment status.
RESULTS: In total, 92.2% of the participants (58.6% male) reported ≥1 HRF, and 
65.7% ≥2 HRFs. Men (71.2%), patients aged 35-49 (67.9%) and 50-64 years (69.5%), 
lower educated (79.0%), and unemployed (77.8%) patients had larger proportions 
of ≥2 HRFs than their counterparts. In all departments, the most common HRF 
profiles included overweight. HRF profiles that included alcohol and/ or smoking 
were more common in ear-nose-throat and trauma surgery than in internal medicine 
and general surgery patients. Men had higher rates concerning almost all HRF 
profiles including ≥2 HRFs and alcohol; women concerning profiles that included 
≤2 HRFs and inactivity. In older patients, profiles with ≥2 HRFs including 
overweight; and in younger patients, profiles with smoking and/or alcohol were 
more common. In lower educated patients, profiles with ≥2 HRFs including 
inactivity; and in higher educated patients profiles with ≤2 HRFs including 
alcohol were more common. Compared to others, unemployed patients had higher 
rates of profiles with ≥3 HRFs including smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Two in three patients require interventions targeting two or more 
HRFs. The findings help to develop screening and brief intervention for patients 
with specific health risk profiles, that can reach most patients, including 
those most in need and those most hard to reach, with socio-economically 
disadvantaged people in particular. REGISTRY: clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01291693.
