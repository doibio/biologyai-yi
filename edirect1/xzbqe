BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most common non-communicable diseases in both 
sexes and a major cause of disability and death around the world, as well as in 
Iran. The aim of the present manuscript is to report the results of the Global 
Burden of Disease study 2010 (the GBD 2010) to compare the results with the 
other similar findings. The paper also discusses the existing deficiencies of 
the GBD study. Our aim was to describe and criticize the attributed burden of 
cancers according to the GBD results by sex and age.
METHODS: The GBD 2010 has profited from 100 collaborators worldwide and provides 
a vast network of data on health outcomes, vital registries, and population 
surveys. The GBD has used various scientific-approved methods to estimate 
important health statuses like death rates, life expectancy, and healthy 
adjusted life expectancy, disability-adjusted life years, years of living lost 
due to premature death and years of life with disabilities. In the present 
study, we extracted and graphed the GBD results for Iran in order to present a 
better scheme for readers.
RESULTS: The mortality rate of cancers in Iranians has increased by about 8.5%, 
the disability-adjusted life year rates have declined by about 9%, and years 
lost due to premature death have also decreased by about 10% from 1990 to 2010 
compared to an 85% increase in years of life with disabilities in the same time 
period.
CONCLUSION: The burden of all non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cancers 
showed decrease during the past two decades. However, these diseases still 
remain worldwide health challenge. Prevention should be considered as an 
important priority and responsibility. The health authorities also need to 
determine the burden of cancers at the national and sub-national levels for 
implementation of effective preventive strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Ensuring that patients receive care that is consistent with their 
goals and values is a critical component of high-quality care. This article 
describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial of a 
multicomponent, structured communication intervention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients with advanced, incurable cancer and life 
expectancy of <12 months will participate together with their surrogate. 
Clinicians are enrolled and randomised either to usual care or the intervention. 
The Serious Illness Care Program is a multicomponent, structured communication 
intervention designed to identify patients, train clinicians to use a structured 
guide for advanced care planning discussion with patients, 'trigger' clinicians 
to have conversations, prepare patients and families for the conversation, and 
document outcomes of the discussion in a structured format in the electronic 
medical record. Clinician satisfaction with the intervention, confidence and 
attitudes will be assessed before and after the intervention. Self-report data 
will be collected from patients and surrogates approximately every 2 months up 
to 2 years or until the patient's death; patient medical records will be 
examined at the close of the study. Analyses will examine the impact of the 
intervention on the patient receipt of goal-concordant care, and peacefulness at 
the end of life. Secondary outcomes include patient anxiety, depression, quality 
of life, therapeutic alliance, quality of communication, and quality of dying 
and death. Key process measures include frequency, timing and quality of 
documented conversations.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute Institutional Review Board. Results will be reported in peer-reviewed 
publications and conference presentations.

The Legacy of 20th Century Phage Research.

Campbell AM.

The Golden Age of Phage Research, where phage was the favored material for 
attacking many basic questions in molecular biology, lasted from about 1940 to 
1970. The era was initiated by Ellis and Delbrück, whose analysis defined the 
relevant parameters to measure in studying phage growth, and depended on the 
fact that the contents of a plaque can comprise descendants of a single 
infecting particle. It ended around 1970 because definitive methods had then 
become available for answering the same questions in other systems. Some of the 
accomplishments of phage research were the demonstration by Hershey and Chase 
that the genetic material of phage T2 is largely composed of DNA, the 
construction of linkage maps of T2 and T4 by Hershey and Rotman and their 
extension to very short molecular distances by Benzer, and the isolation of 
conditionally lethal mutants in T4 by Epstein et al. and in λ by Campbell. The 
dissection of the phage life cycle into causal chains was explored by Edgar and 
Wood for T4 assembly and later in the regulation of lysogeny by Kaiser, extended 
to the molecular level by Ptashne and others. Restriction/modification was 
discovered in λ by Bertani and Weigle, and the biochemical mechanism was 
elucidated by Arber and by Smith.

Correlation of In Vivo Versus In Vitro Benchmark Doses (BMDs) Derived From 
Micronucleus Test Data: A Proof of Concept Study.

In this study, we explored the applicability of using in vitro micronucleus (MN) 
data from human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells to derive in vivo genotoxicity potency 
information. Nineteen chemicals covering a broad spectrum of genotoxic modes of 
action were tested in an in vitro MN test using TK6 cells using the same study 
protocol. Several of these chemicals were considered to need metabolic 
activation, and these were administered in the presence of S9. The Benchmark 
dose (BMD) approach was applied using the dose-response modeling program PROAST 
to estimate the genotoxic potency from the in vitro data. The resulting in vitro 
BMDs were compared with previously derived BMDs from in vivo MN and 
carcinogenicity studies. A proportional correlation was observed between the 
BMDs from the in vitro MN and the BMDs from the in vivo MN assays. Further, a 
clear correlation was found between the BMDs from in vitro MN and the associated 
BMDs for malignant tumors. Although these results are based on only 19 
compounds, they show that genotoxicity potencies estimated from in vitro tests 
may result in useful information regarding in vivo genotoxic potency, as well as 
expected cancer potency. Extension of the number of compounds and further 
investigation of metabolic activation (S9) and of other toxicokinetic factors 
would be needed to validate our initial conclusions. However, this initial work 
suggests that this approach could be used for in vitro to in vivo extrapolations 
which would support the reduction of animals used in research (3Rs: replacement, 
reduction, and refinement).

BACKGROUND: Currently in Japan, both 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV-23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are 
available for the elderly for the prevention of S. pneumoniae-related diseases. 
PPSV-23 was approved in 1988, while the extended use of PCV-13 was approved for 
adults aged 65 and older in June 2014. Despite these two vaccines being 
available, the recently launched national immunisation programme for the elderly 
only subsidised PPSV-23. The framework of the current immunisation programme 
lasts for five years. The elderly population eligible for the subsidised PPSV-23 
shot for the 1st year are those aged 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and ≥ 100. While 
from the 2nd year to the 5th year, those who will age 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 
and 100 will receive the same subsidised shot.
METHODS: We performed economic evaluations to (1) evaluate the efficiency of 
alternative strategies of PPSV-23 single-dose immunisation programme, and (2) 
investigate the efficiency of PCV-13 inclusion in the list for single-dose 
pneumococcal vaccine immunisation programme. Three alternative strategies were 
created in this study, namely: (1) current PPSV-23 strategy, (2) 65 to 80 (as 
"65-80 PPSV-23 strategy"), and (3) 65 and older (as "≥ 65 PPSV-23 strategy"). We 
constructed a Markov model depicting the S. pneumoniae-related disease course 
pathways. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) and disease treatment costs were either calculated or 
cited from literature. Cost of per shot of vaccine was ¥ 8,116 (US$74; US$1 = ¥ 
110) for PPSV-23 and ¥ 10,776 (US$98) for PCV-13. The model runs for 15 years 
with one year cycle after immunisation. Discounting was at 3%.
RESULTS: Compared to current PPSV-23 strategy, 65-80 PPSV-23 strategy cost less 
but gained less, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of ≥ 65 
PPSV-23 strategy was ¥ 5,025,000 (US$45,682) per QALY gained. PCV-13 inclusion 
into the list for single-dose subsidy has an ICER of ¥ 377,000 (US$3,427) per 
QALY gained regardless of the PCV-13 diffusion level. These ICERs were found to 
be cost-effective since they are lower than the suggested criterion by WHO of 
three times GDP (¥ 11,000,000 or US$113,636 per QALY gained), which is the 
benchmark used in judging the cost-effectiveness of an immunisation programmne.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that switching current PPSV-23 strategy to ≥ 65 
PPSV-23 strategy or including PCV-13 into the list for single-dose subsidy to 
the elderly in Japan has value for money.

PURPOSE: Because life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
has increased substantially, assessment of patient-reported health is seen as an 
important component in the follow-up. Therefore, we (1) examined 
patient-reported health status of young people with CHD from a longitudinal 
perspective; (2) compared patient-reported health of patients with that of 
controls from the general population; and (3) investigated longitudinal 
interrelationships among various domains of patient-reported health.
METHODS: We included 429 patients with CHD (aged 14-18 years) in a longitudinal 
study with four measurement points. Patient-reported health status was measured 
using a linear analog scale for self-rated health and the Pediatric Quality of 
Life Inventory (PedsQL).
RESULTS: Self-rated health was good, with mean scores that slightly decreased 
from 81.78 to 78.90 from Time 1 to Time 4. PedsQL scores were also good, with 
the highest scores obtained for physical functioning. Patients with mild heart 
defects consistently reported higher scores on self-rated health and PedsQL than 
the general population. The scores of patients with complex heart defects were 
generally lower than those of the general population. Cross-lagged path analyses 
demonstrated that symptoms, cognitive functioning, and communication problems 
constituted the most consistent predictors of perceived health domains over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported health was considerably good. Domains of 
patient-reported health that deserve specific attention are symptoms, cognitive 
functioning, and communication problems. Intervening in these three domains may 
yield indirect benefits on other health status domains and may improve the 
overall perceived health status of young people with CHD.

BACKGROUND: Since 2001 the Netherlands has shown a sharp upturn in life 
expectancy (LE) after a longer period of slower improvement. This study assessed 
whether changes in healthcare expenditure (HCE) explain this reversal in trends 
in LE. As an alternative explanation, the impact of changes in smoking behavior 
was also evaluated.
METHODS: To quantify the contribution of changes in HCE to changes in LE, we 
estimated a health-production function using a dynamic panel regression approach 
with data on 19 OECD countries (1980-2009), accounting for temporal and spatial 
correlation. Smoking-attributable mortality was estimated using the indirect 
Peto-Lopez method.
RESULTS: As compared to 1990-1999, during 2000-2009 LE in the Netherlands 
increased by 1.8 years in females and by 1.5 years in males. Whereas changes in 
the impact of smoking between the two periods made almost no contribution to the 
acceleration of the increase in LE, changes in the trend of HCE added 0.9 years 
to the LE increase between 2000 and 2009. The exceptional reversal in the trend 
of LE and HCE was not found among the other OECD countries.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that changes in Dutch HCE, and not in smoking, 
made an important contribution to the reversal of the trend in LE; these 
findings support the view that investments in healthcare are increasingly 
important for further progress in life expectancy.

Healthspan Pharmacology.

Jafari M(1).

Author information:

Irvine, California.

The main goal of this paper is to present the case for shifting the focus of 
research on aging and anti-aging from lifespan pharmacology to what I like to 
call healthspan pharmacology, in which the desired outcome is the extension of 
healthy years of life rather than lifespan alone. Lifespan could be influenced 
by both genetic and epigenetic factors, but a long lifespan may not be a good 
indicator of an optimal healthspan. Without improving healthspan, prolonging 
longevity would have enormous negative socioeconomic outcomes for humans. 
Therefore, the goal of aging and anti-aging research should be to add healthy 
years to life and not merely to increase the chronological age. This article 
summarizes and compares two categories of pharmacologically induced lifespan 
extension studies in animal model systems from the last two decades-those 
reporting the effects of pharmacological interventions on lifespan extension 
alone versus others that include their effects on both lifespan and healthspan 
in the analysis. The conclusion is that the extrapolation of pharmacological 
results from animal studies to humans is likely to be more relevant when both 
lifespan and healthspan extension properties of pharmacological intervention are 
taken into account.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of various noninvasive tests (NITs) in 
patients with chronic hepatitis B and elevated transaminases and/or viral load 
who would normally undergo liver biopsy to inform treatment decisions. We 
searched various databases until April 2012. We conducted a systematic review 
and meta-analysis to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of various NITs using a 
bivariate random-effects model. We constructed a probabilistic decision 
analytical model to estimate health care costs and outcomes 
quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) using data from the meta-analysis, 
literature, and national UK data. We compared the cost-effectiveness of four 
decision-making strategies: testing with NITs and treating patients with 
fibrosis stage ≥F2, testing with liver biopsy and treating patients with ≥F2, 
treat none (watchful waiting) and treat all irrespective of fibrosis. Treating 
all patients without prior fibrosis assessment had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £28,137 per additional QALY gained for 
HBeAg-negative patients. For HBeAg-positive patients, using Fibroscan was the 
most cost-effective option with an ICER of £23,345. The base case results 
remained robust in the majority of sensitivity analyses, but were sensitive to 
changes in the ≥ F2 prevalence and the benefit of treatment in patients with 
F0-F1. For HBeAg-negative patients, strategies excluding NITs were the most 
cost-effective: treating all patients regardless of fibrosis level if the high 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000 is accepted; watchful waiting if not. 
For HBeAg-positive patients, using Fibroscan to identify and treat those with 
≥F2 was the most cost-effective option.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease, comprising Crohn's disease and 
ulcerative colitis, is a life-long currently incurable illness. It causes bouts 
of acute intestinal inflammation, in an unpredictable relapsing-remitting 
course, with bloody diarrhoea and extreme urgency to access a toilet. Faecal 
incontinence is a devastating social and hygiene problem, impacting heavily on 
quality of life and ability to work and socialise. Faecal incontinence affects 
2-10 % of adults in the general population. People with inflammatory bowel 
disease have a high risk of incontinence with up to 74 % affected. No previous 
study has explored conservative interventions for these patients.
METHODS: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 186 participants to 
answer the research question: does implementation of the UK nationally 
recommended guidance approach to stepwise management of faecal incontinence 
improve bowel control and quality of life in people with inflammatory bowel 
disease? We have worked with people with inflammatory bowel disease to translate 
this guidance into a condition-specific information booklet on managing 
incontinence. We will randomise participants to receive the booklet, or the 
booklet plus up to four 30-minute sessions with an inflammatory bowel disease 
specialist nurse. To be eligible, patients must be in disease remission and 
report incontinence. The primary outcome measure at 6 months after randomisation 
is the St Mark's incontinence score. Other outcomes include quality of life, 
MY-MOP (generic tool: participants set two goals for intervention, grading goals 
at baseline and then re-scoring after intervention) and EQ-5D-5 L to enable 
calculation of quality-adjusted life years. Analysis will be on an 
intention-to-treat basis. Qualitative interviews will explore participant and 
health professionals' views on the interventions.
DISCUSSION: Few high-quality studies of conservative interventions in 
inflammatory bowel disease, and none for faecal incontinence, have been 
conducted. We have collaborated with patients to design this study. Blinding to 
this behavioural intervention is not possible, but our self-report outcome 
measures with a degree of objectivity. There is genuine equipoise between the 
booklet only and booklet plus nurse arms, and the study will determine if 
additional support from a nurse is a crucial element in implementing advice.

The increase of life expectancy provides the unique opportunity to participate 
actively in social life many years after retirement and upbringing of children. 
In Germany, over 80 % of the population 60 years and older are living 
independently in the community, and approximately 95 % stay in their own homes. 
On the other hand, the probability to suffer from diseases, frailty and impaired 
activities of daily life activities also rises with higher age. However, only on 
rare occasions older people in need of nursing care do like to give up their 
home voluntarily. Next to innovative forms of dwelling, home replacement, 
technical aids and us of information and communication technology (ICT), efforts 
to strengthen the older persons' independence of maintaining mobility in their 
home environment (life space) is emphasised in this article. The particular 
focus is on the use of preventative strategies and to support geriatric network 
facilities.

INTRODUCTION: Recently, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that 
epilepsy develops after approximately 10% of all cerebrovascular lesions. With 
an aging population, poststroke epilepsy is likely to be of increasing relevance 
to neurologists and more knowledge on the condition is needed. Patients with 
poststroke epilepsy are likely to differ from other epilepsy patient populations 
regarding age, side-effect tolerability, comorbidities, and life expectancy, all 
of which are important aspects when counselling newly diagnosed patients to make 
informed treatment decisions.
METHOD: We have here performed a nested case-control study on 36 patients with 
poststroke epilepsy and 55 controls that suffered stroke but did not develop 
epilepsy. The average follow-up time was between 3 and 4 years.
RESULTS: In our material, two-thirds of patients achieved seizure freedom and 
25% experienced a prolonged seizure (status epilepticus) during the follow-up 
period. Cases consumed more health care following their stroke, but did not 
suffer more traumatic injuries. Interestingly, the mortality among cases and 
controls did not differ significantly. This observation needs to be confirmed in 
larger prospective studies, but indicate that poststroke epilepsy might not 
infer additional mortality in this patient group with considerable 
comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The observations presented can be of value in the counselling of 
patients, reducing the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis, and planning of 
future research on poststroke epilepsy.

Three new species of Mycetophilidae - Cordyla monticola sp. n., Cordyla 
pseudopusilla sp. n. and Cordyla reducta sp. n. - are described from the 
Colombian Andes, representing the first described species of Cordyla Meigen from 
the Neotropical region. Colour photos of their habitus, wing and terminalia are 
provided. The morphological affinities of male terminalia are discussed in a 
worldwide context. The distributional pattern of the genus clearly indicates a 
case of northern elements reaching the north-western region of the Neotropics 
that corresponds to a secondary extension of a Holarctic clade to the south.

results.

CONTEXT: Statistical models employed in analysing patient-level cost and 
effectiveness data need to be flexible enough to adjust for any imbalanced 
covariates, account for correlations between key parameters, and accommodate 
potential skewed distributions of costs and/or effects. We compare prominent 
statistical models for cost-effectiveness analysis alongside randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) and covariate adjustment to assess their performance 
and accuracy using data from a large RCT.
METHOD: Seemingly unrelated regressions, linear regression of net monetary 
benefits, and Bayesian generalized linear models with various distributional 
assumptions were used to analyse data from the TASMINH2 trial. Each model 
adjusted for covariates prognostic of costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness results were notably sensitive to model choice. 
Models assuming normally distributed costs and effects provided a poor fit to 
the data, and potentially misleading inference. Allowing for a beta distribution 
captured the true incremental difference in effects and changed the decision as 
to which treatment is preferable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Bayesian generalized linear models which 
allow for non-normality in estimation offer an attractive tool for researchers 
undertaking cost-effectiveness analyses. The flexibility provided by such 
methods allows the researcher to analyse patient-level data which are not 
necessarily normally distributed, while at the same time it enables assessing 
the effect of various baseline covariates on cost-effectiveness results.

BACKGROUND: Proposals for value-based assessment, made by the National Institute 
of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, recommended that burden of 
illness (BOI) should be used to weight QALY gain. This paper explores some of 
the methodological issues in eliciting societal preferences for BOI.
AIMS: This study explores the impact of mode of administration and framing in a 
survey for eliciting societal preferences for BOI.
METHODS: A pairwise comparison survey with six arms was conducted online and via 
face-to-face interviews, involving two different wordings of questions and the 
inclusion/exclusion of pictures. Respondents were asked which of two patient 
groups they thought a publically funded health service should treat, where the 
groups varied by life expectancy without treatment, health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) without treatment, survival gain from treatment, and HRQOL gain 
from treatment. Responses across different modes of administration, wording and 
use of pictures were compared using chi-squared tests and probit regression 
analysis controlling for respondent socio-demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: The sample contained 371 respondents: 69 were interviewed and 302 
completed the questionnaire online. There were some differences in 
socio-demographic characteristics across the online and interview samples. 
Online respondents were less likely to choose the group with higher BOI and more 
likely to treat those with a higher QALY gain, but there were no statistically 
significant differences by wording or the inclusion of pictures for the majority 
of questions. Regression analysis confirmed these results. Respondents chose to 
treat the group with larger treatment gain, but there was little support for 
treating the group with higher BOI. Respondents also preferred to treat the 
group with treatment gains in life expectancy rather than HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Mode of administration did impact on responses, whereas question 
wording and pictures did not impact on responses, even after controlling for the 
socio-demographic characteristics of respondents in the regression analysis.

thrombospondin-1 protein.

The extensible byssus is produced by the foot of bivalve animals, including the 
pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, and enables them to attach to hard underwater 
surfaces. However, the mechanism of their extensibility is not well understood. 
To understand this mechanism, we analyzed the ultrastructure, composition and 
mechanical properties of the P. fucata byssus using electron microscopy, 
elemental analysis, proteomics and mechanical testing. In contrast to the 
microstructures of Mytilus sp. byssus, the P. fucata byssus has an exterior 
cuticle without granules and an inner core with nanocavities. The removal of 
Ca(2+) by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment expands the 
nanocavities and reduces the extensibility of the byssus, which is accompanied 
by a decrease in the β-sheet conformation of byssal proteins. Through proteomic 
methods, several proteins with antioxidant and anti-corrosive properties were 
identified as the main components of the distal byssus regions. Specifically, a 
protein containing thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), which is highly expressed in the 
foot, is hypothesized to be responsible for byssus extensibility. Together, our 
findings demonstrate the importance of inorganic ions and multiple proteins for 
bivalve byssus extension, which could guide the future design of biomaterials 
for use in seawater.

Treatment of Acetabular Fractures in Adolescents.

Although the treatment of acetabular fractures in adults has evolved 
substantially, treatment of these injuries in adolescents remains primarily 
nonoperative. We performed a retrospective review to evaluate outcomes of 
treatment of adolescent acetabular fractures. We identified 38 adolescent 
acetabular fractures (patient ages, 11-18 years), all treated by an experienced 
trauma surgeon. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was performed in 37 
cases, and 1 case was treated nonoperatively. Mean follow-up was 38.2 months. 
All fractures healed. Reduction was anatomical in 30 cases, imperfect in 7. One 
patient had surgical secondary congruence, 1 had preoperative deep vein 
thrombosis, 1 developed a deep infection, and 2 had femoral head avascular 
necrosis and developed posttraumatic arthritis (both had hip dislocations). Of 
the 38 patients, 34 returned to full activity. At latest follow-up, 29 had no 
pain, and 6 had mild intermittent pain not limiting activity. ORIF was found to 
be safe and to result in predictable union. We therefore advocate a more 
aggressive strategy. Given our low complication rate, we recommend nonoperative 
management only for stable, minimally displaced fractures (<1 mm). Unstable 
fractures, fractures with any hip subluxation, and fractures displaced more than 
1 mm should be managed with ORIF. As reported in adults, articular injury often 
is associated with secondary degenerative arthritis. This association is 
expected in adolescents as well. Given adolescents' life expectancy subsequent 
to injury and surgery, any late posttraumatic arthritis will have a significant 
impact on quality of life over the long term, with increased duration compared 
with adults.

BACKGROUND: As a result of the essential role of oestrogens in epiphyseal 
closure, aromatase inhibitors have been trialled as an intervention to improve 
height outcomes in male children and adolescents by inhibiting the conversion of 
testosterone to oestradiol.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of aromatase inhibitors in male children and 
adolescents with short stature.
SEARCH METHODS: To identify relevant trials, we searched the Cochrane Library 
(2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP 
trial register from their inception until August 2014. In addition, we conducted 
citation searches and screened reference lists of included trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) if they 
compared use of an aromatase inhibitor with placebo in male children and 
adolescents with short stature.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened titles and 
abstracts for relevance. Both authors carried out screening for inclusion, data 
extraction, and risk of bias assessment, with any disagreements resolved 
following discussion. We assessed trials for quality of evidence using the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
instrument. We contacted study authors regarding missing information. Primary 
outcomes were final or near-final height, adverse events, and health-related 
quality of life. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cognitive 
outcomes, socioeconomic effects, laboratory measures, short-term growth 
parameters, and assessment of effects on bone health. Meta-analysis was not 
appropriate due to the substantial clinical heterogeneity between trials; we 
presented the findings of the review in narrative format.
MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs involving 207 participants (84 on 
interventions) in the review. Trials included males with constitutional delay of 
growth and puberty (CDGP), idiopathic short stature (ISS), and growth hormone 
(GH) deficiency. Three of the trials had an overall low or unclear risk of bias 
for primary outcomes. Short-term growth outcomes, such as predicted adult 
height, improved in all trials. Just one trial reported the primary outcome of 
final and near-final height as an extension under non-randomised conditions. 
None of the trials assessed health-related quality of life. One publication 
provided detailed information regarding the incidence of adverse events. A 
significant proportion (45%) of prepubertal boys with ISS treated with letrozole 
developed mild morphological abnormalities of their vertebrae, compared with 
none in the placebo group.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggested that aromatase inhibitors 
improved short-term growth outcomes. There was no evidence to support an 
increase in final adult height, based on limited data, with only one of four 
trials publishing final height data under non-randomised conditions.

Family Resiliency: A Neglected Perspective in Addressing Obesity in Young 
Children.

Vegas, NV.

, Urbana, IL.

BACKGROUND: Traditional research primarily details child obesity from a risk 
perspective. Risk factors are disproportionately higher in children raised in 
poverty, thus negatively influencing the weight status of low-income children. 
Borrowing from the field of family studies, the concept of family resiliency 
might provide a unique perspective for discussions regarding childhood obesity, 
by helping to identify mediating or moderating protective mechanisms that are 
present within the family context.
METHODS: A thorough literature review focusing on (1) components of family 
resiliency that could be related to childhood obesity and (2) factors implicated 
in childhood obesity beyond those related to energy balance was conducted. We 
then conceptualized our perspective that understanding resiliency within an 
obesogenic environment is warranted.
RESULTS: Both family resiliency and childhood obesity prevention rely on the 
assumptions that (1) no one single answer can address the multifactorial nature 
involved with adopting healthy lifestyle behaviors and (2) the pieces in this 
complex puzzle will differ between families. Yet, there are limited holistic 
studies connecting family resiliency measures and childhood obesity prevention. 
Combining mixed methodology using traditional measures (such as general 
parenting styles, feeding styles, and parent feeding behaviors) with potential 
family resiliency measures (such as family routines, family stress, family 
functioning, and family structure) might serve to broaden understanding of 
protective strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The key to future success in child obesity prevention and treatment 
may be found in the application of the resiliency framework to the exploration 
of childhood obesity from a protective perspective focusing on the family 
context.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with acromegaly exhibit reduced life expectancy and 
increased prevalence of age-related diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, 
and cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully 
elucidated. Telomere shortening is reportedly associated with reduced life 
expectancy and increased prevalence of these age-related diseases.
METHODS: We measured telomere length in patients with acromegaly using 
quantitative PCR method. The effect of GH and IGF-I on telomere length and 
cellular senescence was examined in human skin fibroblasts.
RESULTS: Patients with acromegaly exhibited shorter telomere length than age-, 
sex-, smoking-, and diabetes-matched control patients with non-functioning 
pituitary adenoma (0.62 ± 0.23 vs. 0.75 ± 0.35, respectively, P = 0.047). In 
addition, telomere length in acromegaly was negatively correlated with the 
disease duration (R2 = 0.210, P = 0.003). In vitro analysis revealed that not GH 
but IGF-I induced telomere shortening in human skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, 
IGF-I-treated cells showed increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase 
activity and expression of p53 and p21 protein. IGF-I-treated cells reached the 
Hayflick limit earlier than GH- or vehicle-treated cells, indicating that IGF-I 
induces cellular senescence.
CONCLUSION: Shortened telomeres in acromegaly and cellular senescence induced by 
IGF-I can explain, in part, the underlying mechanisms by which acromegaly 
exhibits an increased morbidity and mortality in association with the excess 
secretion of IGF-I.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the tremendous improvements in survival, some groups of 
people living with HIV (PLHIV) continue to have lower survival rates than the 
overall HIV-positive population. Here, we characterize the evolving pattern of 
mortality among PLHIV in British Columbia since the beginning of the expansion 
of antiretroviral treatment in 2003.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 3653 individuals ≥20 years 
old, who enrolled on treatment between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012, 
and were followed until December 31, 2013. All-cause mortality rates and 
standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare mortality 
outcomes of PLHIV to the general population. Abridged life tables were 
constructed to estimate the life expectancy at age 20 years for PLHIV.
RESULTS: The overall crude mortality rate was 28.57 per 1000 person-years, the 
SMR was 3.22 and the life expectancy was 34.53 years. Interestingly, if we 
considered only individuals alive after the first year, the life expectancy 
increased to 48.70 years (41% increase). The SMRs for males and females 
decreased over time. Although females had higher SMRs in 2003 to 2008, this 
difference no longer existed in 2009 to 2011. There were also important 
differences in mortality outcomes for different clinical and demographical 
characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality outcomes of PLHIV who initiated antiretroviral treatment 
have dramatically improved over the last decade. However, there is still room 
for improvement and multilateral efforts should continue to promote early, 
sustained engagement of PLHIV on treatment so that the impact of treatment can 
be fully realized.
