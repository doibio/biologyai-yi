OBJECTIVE: To compare long term outcomes after great saphenous vein (GSV) 
treatment with three radiofrequency (RF) thermal devices: Venefit (Closurefast), 
Radiofrequency Induced Thermal Therapy (RFITT), and Endovenous Radiofrequency 
(EVRF).
DESIGN: A 72 month follow up of patients who were treated in the randomised 3RF 
study.
METHODS: A total of 172 participants from the 3RF study were invited to take 
part in a single visit, long term, follow up study. Failure of GSV closure was 
assessed with duplex ultrasound (DUS) and constituted the primary outcome. 
Patients completed questionnaires for secondary outcomes: Aberdeen Varicose Vein 
Questionnaire (AVVQ), Euroqol 5D (EQ-5D), and patient reported varicose veins 
measured by counting vein occupying boxes in AVVQ question 1.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (12%) had already been re-treated. Of the 
remainder, 13 (7%) could not be contacted, 20 (11%) declined invitation, and one 
did not consent. Therefore, 116 (64%) and 95 (53%) participants completed 
questionnaires and DUS, respectively. Failure of GSV closure on 72 month DUS was 
16%, 21%, and 37% for Venefit, RFITT, and EVRF, respectively (p = .14), whilst 
outcomes for all failures were 14%, 17%, and 44% (p < .001) (Venefit vs. EVRF: p 
< .001; RFITT vs. EVRF: p < .001; and Venefit vs. RFITT: p = .63). There were no 
between group differences in AVVQ or EQ-5D scores. Rates of patient reported 
presence of any varicose veins were high for all groups (97%, 92%, and 97% after 
Venefit, RFITT, and EVRF, respectively; p = .48). The EVRF treated participants 
reported more extensive recurrence than the Venefit and RFITT participants (p = 
.008).
CONCLUSION: Long term technical outcomes after RF ablation for GSV varicose 
veins were significantly better after Venefit and RFITT compared with EVRF 
treatment. However, quality of life scores showed no differences after 72 
months. Rates of patient reporting any varicose veins were high for all 
treatments.

AIM: To describe burden, and to explore cross-country inequalities across 
sociodemographic development levels for four autoimmune diseases (ADs) including 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis 
(MS) and psoriasis (PS).
METHODS: The estimates and their 95% uncertainty interval (UI) for 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of RA, IBD, MS and PS were extracted from 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. 
Age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) across 204 countries, as well as age and sex 
distribution of global DALYs rate of these four ADs were illustrated. Slope 
index of inequality and concentration index, which are two standard metrics of 
absolute and relative gradient inequality recommended by World Health 
Organization (WHO), were utilized to quantify the distributive inequalities in 
the burden of ADs.
RESULTS: In 2019, the ASDR of RA, IBD, MS and PS varied remarkably across 204 
countries, with different age and sex distribution of global DALYs rate. The 
slope index of inequality changed from 26.7 (95% CI: 20.7 to 32.8) in 1990 to 
40.3 (95% CI: 31.9 to 48.7) in 2019 for RA, from 17.1 (95% CI: 12.4 to 21.7) in 
1990 to 25.2 (95% CI: 20.1 to 30.2) in 2019 for IBD, from 19.3 (95% CI: 15.2 to 
23.4) in 1990 to 28.9 (95% CI: 24.2 to 33.5) in 2019 for MS, from 42.3 (95% CI: 
33.1 to 51.6) in 1990 to 40.2 (95% CI: 32.5 to 48.0) in 2019 for PS. Moreover, 
the concentration index showed 20.4 (95% CI: 18.9 to 22.0) in 1990 and 18.2 (95% 
CI: 16.7 to 19.6) in 2019 for RA, 25.0 (95% CI: 23.0 to 27.1) in 1990 and 33.5 
(95% CI: 31.6 to 35.5) in 2019 for IBD, 46.7 (95% CI: 44.0 to 49.3) in 1990 and 
41.8 (95% CI: 39.6 to 44.1) in 2019 for MS, 31.7 (95% CI: 29.0 to 34.4) in 1990 
and 32.6 (95% CI: 29.9 to 35.2) in 2019 for PS.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong heterogeneity in ASDR across all countries, as 
well as in age and sex distribution of global DALYs rate for four ADs including 
RA, IBD, MS and PS. Countries with higher sociodemographic development levels 
shouldered disproportionately higher burden of ADs, and the magnitude of this 
sociodemographic development level-related inequalities exacerbated over time.

The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the International 
Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD), the European College for 
the Study of Vulval Disease (ECSVD), and the European Federation for Colposcopy 
(EFC) developed consensus statements on pre-invasive vulvar lesions in order to 
improve the quality of care for patients with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 
(VaIN). The management of VaIN varies according to the grade of the lesion: VaIN 
1 (low grade vaginal squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL)) can be subjected to 
follow-up, while VaIN 2-3 (high-grade vaginal SIL) should be treated. Treatment 
needs individualization according to the patient's characteristics, disease 
extension and previous therapeutic procedures. Surgical excision is the mainstay 
of treatment and should be performed if invasion cannot be excluded. Total 
vaginectomy is used only in highly selected cases of extensive and persistent 
disease. Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser may be used as both an ablation method and 
an excisional one. Reported cure rates after laser excision and laser ablation 
are similar. Topical agents are useful for persistent, multifocal lesions or for 
patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment. Imiquimod was associated with 
the lowest recurrence rate, highest human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance, and 
can be considered the best topical approach. Trichloroacetic acid and 
5-fluorouracil are historical options and should be discouraged. For VaIN after 
hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3, laser vaporization 
and topical agents are not the best options, since they cannot reach epithelium 
buried in the vaginal scar. In these cases surgical options are preferable. 
Brachytherapy has a high overall success rate but due to late side effects 
should be reserved for poor surgical candidates, having multifocal disease, and 
with failed prior treatments. VaIN tends to recur and ensuring patient adherence 
to close follow-up visits is of the utmost importance. The first evaluation 
should be performed at 6 months with cytology and an HPV test during 2 years and 
annually thereafter. The implementation of vaccination against HPV infection is 
expected to contribute to the prevention of VaIN and thus cancer of the vagina. 
The effects of treatment can have an impact on quality of life and result in 
psychological and psychosexual issues which should be addressed. Patients with 
VaIN need clear and up-to-date information on a range of treatment options 
including risks and benefits, as well as the need for follow-up and the risk of 
recurrence.

Heart failure is a life-threatening syndrome that is diagnosed in 3.6 million 
people worldwide each year. We propose a deep fusion learning model (DFL-IMP) 
that uses time series and category data from electronic health records to 
predict in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure. We considered 41 
time series features (platelets, white blood cells, urea nitrogen, etc.) and 17 
category features (gender, insurance, marital status, etc.) as predictors, all 
of which were available within the time of the patient's last hospitalization, 
and a total of 7696 patients participated in the observational study. Our model 
was evaluated against different time windows. The best performance was achieved 
with an AUC of 0.914 when the observation window was 5 days and the prediction 
window was 30 days. Outperformed other baseline models including LR (0.708), RF 
(0.717), SVM (0.675), LSTM (0.757), GRU (0.759), GRU-U (0.766) and MTSSP 
(0.770). This tool allows us to predict the expected pathway of heart failure 
patients and intervene early in the treatment process, which has significant 
implications for improving the life expectancy of heart failure patients.

BACKGROUND: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by progressive and 
predominantly proximal and axial muscle atrophy and weakness. Respiratory muscle 
weakness results in impaired cough with recurrent respiratory tract infections, 
nocturnal hypoventilation, and may ultimately lead to fatal respiratory failure 
in the most severely affected patients. Treatment strategies to either slow down 
the decline or improve respiratory muscle function are wanting.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of 
respiratory muscle training (RMT) in patients with SMA and respiratory muscle 
weakness.
METHODS: The effect of RMT in patients with SMA, aged ≥ 8 years with respiratory 
muscle weakness (maximum inspiratory mouth pressure [PImax] ≤ 80 Centimeters of 
Water Column [cmH2O]), will be investigated with a single blinded randomized 
sham-controlled trial consisting of a 4-month training period followed by an 
8-month open label extension phase.
INTERVENTION: The RMT program will consist of a home-based, individualized 
training program involving 30-breathing cycles through an inspiratory and 
expiratory muscle training device. Patients will be instructed to perform 10 
training sessions over 5-7 days per week. In the active training group, the 
inspiratory and expiratory threshold will be adjusted to perceived exertion 
(measured on a Borg scale). The sham-control group will initially receive RMT at 
the same frequency but against a constant, non-therapeutic resistance. After 
four months the sham-control group will undergo the same intervention as the 
active training group (i.e., delayed intervention). Individual adherence to the 
RMT protocol will be reviewed every two weeks by telephone/video call with a 
physiotherapist.
MAIN STUDY PARAMETERS/ENDPOINTS: We hypothesize that the RMT program will be 
feasible (good adherence and good acceptability) and improve inspiratory muscle 
strength (primary outcome measure) and expiratory muscle strength (key secondary 
outcome measure) as well as lung function, patient reported breathing 
difficulties, respiratory infections, and health related quality of life 
(additional secondary outcome measures, respectively) in patients with SMA.
DISCUSSION: RMT is expected to have positive effects on respiratory muscle 
strength in patients with SMA. Integrating RMT with recently introduced genetic 
therapies for SMA may improve respiratory muscle strength in this patient 
population.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is associated with mortality and many other adverse 
health outcomes. In 2021, the World Health Organization established a new NO2 
air quality guideline (AQG) (annual average <10 μg/m3). However, the burden of 
diseases attributable to long-term NO2 exposure above the AQG is unknown in 
China. Nitrogen oxide is a major air pollutant in populous cities, which are 
disproportionately impacted by NO2; this represents a form of environmental 
inequality. We conducted a nationwide risk assessment of premature deaths 
attributable to long-term NO2 exposure from 2013 to 2020 based on the 
exposure-response relationship, high-resolution annual NO2 concentrations, and 
gridded population data (considering sex, age, and residence [urban vs rural]). 
We calculated health metrics including attributable deaths, years of life lost 
(YLL), and loss of life expectancy (LLE). Inequality in the distribution of 
attributable deaths and YLLs was evaluated by the Lorenz curve and Gini index. 
According to the health impact assessments, in 2013, long-term NO2 exposure 
contributed to 315,847 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 306,709-319,269) premature 
deaths, 7.90 (7.68-7.99) million YLLs, and an LLE of 0.51 (0.50-0.52) years. The 
high-risk subgroup (top 20%) accounted for 85.7% of all NO2-related deaths and 
85.2% of YLLs, resulting in Gini index values of 0.81 and 0.67, respectively. 
From 2013 to 2020, the estimated health impact from NO2 exposure was 
significantly reduced, but inequality displayed a slightly increasing trend. Our 
study revealed a considerable burden of NO2-related deaths in China, which were 
disproportionally frequent in a small high-risk subgroup. Future clean air 
initiatives should focus not only on reducing the average level of NO2 exposure 
but also minimizing inequality.

Ketogenic therapies for glioblastoma: Understanding the limitations in 
transitioning from mice to patients.

Glioblastoma Multiforme is an aggressive brain cancer affecting children and 
adults frequently resulting in a short life expectancy. Current cancer therapies 
include surgery and radiation followed by chemotherapy, which due to their 
ineffectiveness, requires repeated exposure to the same therapies. Since the 
1990s, researchers and doctors have explored other therapies, such as diet 
therapies, to aid in combating gliomas. The ketogenic diet has gained popularity 
due to Otto Warburg's theory that tumor cells prefer "aerobic glycolysis" and 
cannot metabolize ketones. The inability of gliomas to use ketones provides an 
excellent opportunity to weaken the tumor while protecting healthy cells during 
cancer treatments. This review will examine some of the current research using 
the ketogenic diet as a form of cancer therapy to determine if this intervention 
is manageable and effective in patients with glioblastoma. Peer-reviewed 
articles from 2009 to 2019 were used. The primary objective is to distinguish 
differences between pre-clinical and clinical research to determine if the 
ketogenic diet is reproducible from mouse models into humans to determine its 
effectiveness. The analysis revealed several limitations of the ketogenic diet 
as an intervention. The effectiveness is more robust in mice than in human 
studies. Furthermore, tolerability is marginally supported in human studies 
requiring more reproducible research to validate that the intervention is 
manageable and effective in patients with glioblastoma.

The purpose was to create a novel composite food preservative for fresh-cut 
lettuce using flavonoids and chitosan from sea buckthorn leaves (SBL). Sea 
buckthorn leaves were extracted with ethanol as the extraction solvent and 
ultrasonic-assisted extraction to obtain flavonoid from sea buckthorn leaf crude 
(FSL), and then the FSL was secondarily purified with AB-8 resin and polyamide 
resin to obtain flavonoid from sea buckthorn leaf purified (FSL-1). Different 
concentrations of FSL-1 and chitosan were made into a composite preservative 
(FCCP) by magnetic stirring and other methods, containing 1% chitosan 
preservative (CP) alone, 0.5-2 mg/ml of FSL-1 and 1% chitosan composite 
preservative (FCCP-1, FCCP-2, FCCP-3, and FCCP-4), and the FSL-1 concentrations 
were analyzed the effect of FSL-1 concentration on the physicochemical 
properties of the composite preservatives, including their film-forming ability, 
antioxidant capacity and ability to prevent bacterial growth, was analyzed. To 
further investigate the effect of the combined preservatives on fresh-cut 
lettuce, different FCCPs were applied to the surface was stored at 4°C for 
7 days. Then the changes in weight loss, hardness, browning index, total 
chlorophyll content, SOD and MDA were analyzed. It was used to assess the 
physicochemical indicators of fresh-cut lettuce throughout storage. According to 
the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FSL-1 and chitosan 
interacted to form hydrogen bonds, and the contact angle and viscosity of FCCP 
increased on both horizontal glass and polystyrene plates, indicating the good 
film-forming properties of the composite preservation solution. With the 
diameter of the antibacterial zone of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, 
Salmonella typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes being (21.39 ± 0.22), 
(17.43 ± 0.24), (15.30 ± 0.12), and (14.43 ± 0.24) mm, respectively. It was 
proved that the antibacterial activity of FCCP became stronger with the increase 
of FSL-1 concentration and had the best antibacterial effect on S. aureus. The 
complex preservative showed the best scavenging effect on ferric reducing 
antioxidant capacity, DPPH radicals (96.64%) and 2,2'-Azinobis- 
(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radicals (99.42%) when FSL-1 was 
added at 2 mg/ml. When fresh-cut lettuce was coated with FCCP for the same 
storage time, various indicators of lettuce such as weight loss, hardness, 
browning index, SOD activity and MDA content were better than the control group 
showing good potential in fresh-cut vegetables and fruits preservation. FCCP 
holds great promise for food safety quality and shelf-life extension as a new 
natural food preservative. The waste utilization of sea buckthorn leaves can 
greatly improve his utilization and economic benefits.

Although shown to be effective in improving survival and quality of life in 
patients with cancer, some treatments are well-known causes of cardiotoxicity, 
such as anthracyclines, monoclonal antibodies against human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) and radiotherapy. To prevent cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) in patients living with cancer, cardiologists and oncologists promoted the 
development of cardio-oncology, an interdisciplinary field which aims to further 
improving life expectancy in these patients. Cardio-oncology rehabilitation 
(CORE), through correction of risk factors, prescription of drug therapies and 
structured exercise programs, tries to improve symptoms, quality of life, 
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and survival in patients with cancer. Different 
imaging modalities can be used to evaluate the real effectiveness of exercise 
training on cardiac function. Among these, the global longitudinal strain (GLS) 
has recently aroused interest, thanks to its high sensitivity and specificity 
for cardiac dysfunction detection due to advanced ultrasound programs. This 
review summarizes the evidence on the usefulness of GLS in patients with cancer 
undergoing cardiac rehabilitation programs.

BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a growing concern about the disease burden of 
child asthma particularly due to high body mass index (BMI). The prevalence and 
disease burden of asthma differ between developing and developed countries, with 
implications on disease intervention. Therefore, we provide a comparative 
analysis of childhood asthma between China and the United States of America 
(USA).
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data, we estimated and 
compared the age-standardized prevalence, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years of lost due to disability (YLDs), 
DALYs due to high BMI of asthma in children aged 1-14 years in China and the 
USA. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied to assess changes in temporal 
trends.
RESULTS: DALYs due to high BMI and the ratio of DALYs to DALYs due to high BMI 
in children with asthma showed a significant upward trend in both countries and 
were higher in males than in females. Almost all epidemiological indicators of 
asthma showed a hump of curve from 2014 to 2019, and peaked in 2017. There was a 
decreasing trend of YLLs for asthma in children both countries, while China has 
a saliently greater decreasing trend.
CONCLUSION: The disease burden caused by high BMI of childhood asthma was on the 
rise in children with asthma in both China and the USA. High BMI needs to be 
taken more into account in the development of future policies for the 
prevention, control, and treatment of childhood asthma. However, the increasing 
trend of this disease burden in American children was significantly lower than 
that in Chinese children. We recommend learning from the American government to 
impose a high-calorie tax, increase physical exercise facilities, and provide 
better health care policies.

systematic review.

University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

Although leading causes of death are regularly reported, there is disagreement 
on which long-term conditions (LTCs) reduce disability-free life expectancy 
(DFLE) the most. We aimed to estimate increases in DFLE associated with 
elimination of a range of LTCs. This is a comprehensive systematic review and 
meta-analysis of studies assessing the effects of LTCs on health expectancy 
(HE). MEDLINE, Embase, HMIC, Science Citation Index, and Social Science Citation 
Index were systematically searched for studies published in English from July 
2007 to July 2020 with updated searches from inception to April 8, 2021. LTCs 
considered included: arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease including 
stroke and peripheral vascular disease, respiratory disease, visual and hearing 
impairment, dementia, cognitive impairment, depression, cancer, and comorbidity. 
Studies were included if they estimated HE outcomes (disability-free, active or 
healthy life expectancy) at age 50 or older for individuals with and without the 
LTC. Study selection and quality assessment were undertaken by teams of 
independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was feasible if three or more studies 
assessed the impact of the same LTC on the same HE at the same age using 
comparable methods, with narrative syntheses for the remaining studies. Studies 
reporting Years of Life Lost (YLL), Years of Life with Disability (YLD) and 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs = YLL+YLD) were included but reported 
separately as incomparable with other HE outcomes (PROSPERO registration: 
CRD42020196049). Searches returned 6072 unique records, yielding 404 eligible 
for full text retrieval from which 30 DFLE-related and 7 DALY-related were 
eligible for inclusion. Thirteen studies reported a single condition, and 17 
studies reported on more than one condition (two to nine LTCs). Only seven 
studies examined the impact of comorbidities. Random effects meta-analyses were 
feasible for a subgroup of studies examining diabetes (four studies) or 
respiratory diseases (three studies) on DFLE. From pooled results, individuals 
at age 65 without diabetes gain on average 2.28 years disability-free compared 
to those with diabetes (95% CI: 0.57-3.99, p<0.01, I2 = 96.7%), whilst 
individuals without respiratory diseases gain on average 1.47 years compared to 
those with respiratory diseases (95% CI: 0.77-2.17, p<0.01, I2 = 79.8%). 
Eliminating diabetes, stroke, hypertension or arthritis would result in 
compression of disability. Of the seven longitudinal studies assessing the 
impact of multiple LTCs, three found that stroke had the greatest effect on DFLE 
for both genders. This study is the first to systematically quantify the impact 
of LTCs on both HE and LE at a global level, to assess potential compression of 
disability. Diabetes, stroke, hypertension and arthritis had a greater effect on 
DFLE than LE and so elimination would result in compression of disability. 
Guidelines for reporting HE outcomes would assist data synthesis in the future, 
which would in turn aid public health policy.

Life expectancy (LE) depends on the wider determinants of health, many of which 
have gendered effects worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 
whether gender equality was associated with LE for women and men and the gender 
gap in LE across the globe. Gender equality in 156 countries was estimated using 
a modified global gender gap index (mGGGI), based on the index developed by the 
World Economic Forum between 2010 and 2021. Linear regression was used to 
investigate the association between the mGGGI and its economic, political, and 
education subindices and the gender gap in LE and women and men's LE. Overall, 
the mGGGI increased from 58% in 2010 to 62% in 2021. Globally, changes in the 
mGGGI and its economic and political subindexes were not associated with changes 
in the gender gap in LE or with LE for women and men between 2010 and 2020. 
Improvements in gender equality in education were associated with a longer LE 
for women and men and widening of the gender gap in LE. In 2021, each 10% 
increase in the mGGGI was associated with a 4.3-month increase in women's LE and 
a 3.5-month increase in men's LE, and thus with an 8-month wider gender gap. 
However, the direction and magnitude of these associations varied between 
regions. Each 10% increase in the mGGGI was associated with a 6-month narrower 
gender gap in high-income countries, and a 13- and 16-month wider gender gap in 
South and Southeast Asia and Oceania, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. 
Globally, greater gender equality is associated with longer LE for both women 
and men and a widening of the gender gap in LE. The variation in this 
association across world regions suggests that gender equality may change as 
countries progress towards socioeconomic development and gender equality.

Platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) generated upon platelet activation may 
play a role in inflammatory pathologies such as atherosclerosis. Oxidized 
low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a well-known contributor to atherogenesis, 
activates platelets and presensitizes them for activation by other agonists. We 
studied the effect of oxLDL on the secretion, composition, and inflammatory 
functions of PEVs using contemporary EV analytics. Platelets were activated by 
co-stimulation with thrombin (T) and collagen (C) ± oxLDL and characterized by 
high-resolution flow cytometry, nanoparticle tracking analysis, proximity 
extension assay, western blot, and electron microscopy. The effect of PEVs on 
macrophage differentiation and functionality was examined by analyzing 
macrophage surface markers, cytokine secretion, and transcriptome. OxLDL 
upregulated TC-induced formation of CD61+, P-selectin+ and phosphatidylserine+ 
PEVs. Blocking the scavenger receptor CD36 significantly suppressed the 
oxLDL+TC-induced PEV formation, and HDL caused a slight but detectable 
suppression. The inflammatory protein cargo differed between the PEVs from 
stimulated and unstimulated platelets. Both oxLDL+TC- and TC-induced PEVs 
enhanced macrophage HLA-DR and CD86 expression and decreased CD11c expression as 
well as secretion of several cytokines. Pathways related to cell cycle and 
regulation of gene expression, and immune system signaling were overrepresented 
in the differentially expressed genes between TC PEV -treated vs. control 
macrophages and oxLDL+TC PEV -treated vs. control macrophages, respectively. In 
conclusion, we speculate that oxLDL and activated platelets contribute to 
proatherogenic processes by increasing the number of PEVs that provide an 
adhesive and procoagulant surface, contain inflammatory mediators, and subtly 
finetune the macrophage gene expression.

Comparison of Bayesian Spatiotemporal Models for Small-Area Life Expectancy: A 
Simulation Study.

Kim I, Kang HY, Khang YH.

The purpose of this study was to assess the precision, uncertainty, and 
normality of small-area life expectancy estimates calculated using Bayesian 
spatiotemporal models. We hypothesized 6 scenarios in which all 247 districts of 
South Korea had the same year-specific female population of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 
5,000, 10,000, and 25,000 individuals during the study period (2013-2017). We 
generated 1,000 hypothetical data sets for each scenario and calculated 
district-year life expectancies. The precision and uncertainty of life 
expectancy estimates were compared between 2 Bayesian spatiotemporal models and 
the traditional method and Bayesian spatial models. We examined the normality of 
the life expectancy distributions generated by each method and investigated an 
optimal cutoff value for the comparisons. The Bayesian spatiotemporal models 
produced precise life expectancy estimates. However, the 95% uncertainty 
interval contained the true value with a probability of less than 95%. The 
Bayesian spatiotemporal models violated the normality assumption in scenarios 
with small population sizes. Therefore, life expectancy comparisons should be 
conducted using a cutoff value that minimizes false-positive and false-negative 
rates. We propose 0.8 as a cutoff value for determining the statistical 
significance of the difference in life expectancy.

The virtual circular genome (VCG) model was proposed as a means of going beyond 
template copying to indefinite cycles of nonenzymatic RNA replication during the 
origin of life. In the VCG model, the protocellular genome is a collection of 
short oligonucleotides that map to both strands of a virtual circular sequence. 
Replication is driven by templated nonenzymatic primer extensions on a subset of 
kinetically trapped partially base-paired configurations, followed by the 
shuffling of these configurations to enable continued oligonucleotide 
elongation. Here, we describe initial experimental studies of the feasibility of 
the VCG model for replication. We designed a small 12-nucleotide model VCG and 
synthesized all 247 oligonucleotides of lengths 2 to 12 corresponding to this 
genome. We experimentally monitored the fate of individual labeled primers in 
the pool of VCG oligonucleotides following the addition of activated nucleotides
