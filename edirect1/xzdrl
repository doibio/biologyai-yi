OBJECTIVES: Suicide is a critical public health issue worldwide. The objective 
was to report the findings from the Global Burden of Disease study on the burden 
of suicide in Latin America from 1990 to 2019 and to assess its association with 
the sociodemographic index (SDI).
STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study.
METHODS: Following the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study, suicide mortality, 
premature mortality, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted 
life-years in Latin America are reported.
RESULTS: The number of deaths from suicides increased significantly in most 
countries, but the age-standardized suicide mortality rate had a heterogeneous 
behavior. Suicide burden was higher for males in all age groups, and in most 
countries, the male-to-female ratio increased between 1990 and 2019. Almost all 
suicide burden is attributable to premature mortality. The highest suicide 
burden was present in young males and females. All countries had an increase in 
the SDI, and in most countries, there was a statistically significant 
correlation between this indicator and the suicide disability-adjusted 
life-years rates.
CONCLUSIONS: To best promote suicide prevention, it is important to understand 
sex and age-specific suicide burden patterns. According to these results, 
prevention programs intended to prevent suicide should be implemented with a 
special focus on high-risk groups such as young adults and the elderly.

Most illnesses and deaths in industry workers are associated with occupational 
diseases (ODs). In recent years, mining has grown rapidly into a major driver of 
the Mongolian economy. In this study, the organization-based registry data on OD 
incidence and mortality from the archival data of the 'Erdenet' Copper and 
Molybdenum Concentrator Plant in Mongolia were used. We estimated the ODs burden 
in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) loss between 1999 and 2019. A total of 
72,802 DALYs were lost over 20 years, of which 97.5% were due to years lived 
with disability and 2.5% for years of life lost. The disease burden was high in 
men, accounting for 76.8% of total DALY. In terms of age groups, among people 
aged 46-55, DALY accounted for the largest percentage of losses. We found that 
workplace dust, noise, ergonomics, and vibration were the main factors 
attributed to the DALYs during the past two decades.

INTRODUCTION: Surgery and chemotherapy have increased the survival of pancreatic 
cancer. The decrease in postoperative morbidity and mortality and increase in 
life expectancy, has expanded the indications por cephalic 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PDC), although it remains controversial in the 
geriatric population.
METHODS: Retrospective study on a prospective database of patients with ductal 
adenocarcinoma of pancreas who underwent PDC between 2007-2018. The main 
objective was to analyse the morbidity-mortality and survival associated with 
PDC in patients ≥75 years (elderly).
RESULTS: 79 patients were included, 21 of them older than 75 years (27%); within 
this group, 23'9% were over 80 years old. The ASA of both groups was similar. 
Patients ≥75 years required more transfusions. No differences in operating time 
were observed, although more vascular resection were performed in the elderly 
(26 vs. 8.7%; P = .037). Morbidity was higher in the elderly (61.9% vs. 46.6%), 
although without differences. Patients aged ≥75 years had more non-surgical 
complications (33.3%, P = .050), being pneumonia the most frequent. 
Postoperative mortality was higher in the ≥75 years (9 vs. 0%; P = .017). The 
overall survival and disease-free survival did not show significant differences 
in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher postoperative mortality and more 
non-surgical complications. Survival did not show differences, so with an 
adequate selection of patients, age should not be considered itself as a 
contraindication for PDC.

[Purpose] Knee osteoarthritis can alter gait variability; however, few studies 
have investigated the associating factors with gait cycle time variability. The 
first objective was to compare gait cycle variability between female patients 
with knee osteoarthritis and healthy elderly females and to determine gait 
characteristics in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The second objective was 
to identify the associating factors with gait cycle time variability. 
[Participants and Methods] The participants included 24 female patients 
diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and 12 healthy elderly females. Gait cycle 
variability (coefficient of variation of gait cycle time), knee extension range 
of motion, knee extension strength, 5-m walk test, Timed Up & Go Test, and 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index were measured. 
All assessment results were compared between the knee osteoarthritis and healthy 
groups. [Results] Gait cycle time variability was significantly higher in the 
knee osteoarthritis group than in the healthy group. Further, it showed a 
significant positive correlation with the 5-m walk test and the Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. [Conclusion] Patients with knee 
osteoarthritis presented greater gait cycle variability than that of healthy 
individuals. Therefore, rehabilitation to improve gait variability might enhance 
the quality of life of patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by insufficient 
levels of the essential mitochondrial protein frataxin. It is a severely 
debilitating disease that significantly impacts the quality of life of affected 
patients and reduces their life expectancy, however, an adequate cure is not yet 
available for patients. Frataxin function, although not thoroughly elucidated, 
is associated with assembly of iron-sulfur cluster and iron metabolism, 
therefore insufficient frataxin levels lead to reduced activity of many 
mitochondrial enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, impaired 
mitochondrial metabolism, reduced ATP production and inefficient anti-oxidant 
response. As a consequence, neurons progressively die and patients progressively 
lose their ability to coordinate movement and perform daily activities. 
Therapeutic strategies aim at restoring sufficient frataxin levels or at 
correcting some of the downstream consequences of frataxin deficiency. However, 
the classical pathways of drug discovery are challenging, require a significant 
amount of resources and time to reach the final approval, and present a high 
failure rate. Drug repositioning represents a viable alternative to boost the 
identification of a therapy, particularly for rare diseases where resources are 
often limited. In this review we will describe recent efforts aimed at the 
identification of a therapy for Friedreich ataxia through drug repositioning, 
and discuss the limitation of such strategies.

Long-Term Follow-Up of the Auditory Threshold After a Fully Implantable Middle 
Ear Implant.

Monini S(1), Filippi C(1), Salerno G(1), Barbara M(1).

Italy.

A fully implantable active middle ear device has been proposed and indicated for 
the rehabilitation of bilateral moderate or moderate-to-severe sensorineural 
hearing loss, assuming it would overcome the disadvantages of a conventional 
hearing aid. The indications have further been extended to severe or 
severe-to-profound forms of hearing loss in the case of an expected limited or 
null efficacy of hearing aids. While the literature has highlighted several 
positive aspects of the device, including a better quality of life related to 
its invisibility, the improvement of auditory and perceptual functions has not 
been controlled for throughout a long period of follow-up. The present study 
aimed to verify the behavior of the auditory threshold, especially the bone 
conduction (BC) component, in the implanted ear in a group of implantees 
affected by initial bilateral symmetric hearing loss of different severity 
grades. The BC threshold was assessed preoperatively at activation and at the 
last follow-up (ranging from 4 to 12 years) in the implanted ear, and 
preoperatively and at the last follow-up in the contralateral ear, to monitor 
eventual deteriorated values in both ears over time. The pure tone average (PTA; 
250-4,000 Hz), speech reception threshold (SRT) and the maximum word recognition 
score as a percentage (% WRS) and in dB HL were measured in the implanted ear to 
verify the efficacy of the device after the first fitting at device activation. 
A significant worsening of the BC threshold with respect to the baseline 
threshold was noticed during further follow-up. When comparing the implanted ear 
with the contralateral ear, a significant worsening of the bone PTA was assessed 
in the former with respect to the contralateral ear. Despite the worsened 
hearing found in the implanted ears, the beneficial gains in PTA and speech 
audiometry observed at the first activation remained constant at the follow-up, 
thus showing an extension of the efficacy of this device in aiding those with up 
to the most severe forms of sensorineural hearing loss.

Rumen microbiota are closely linked to feed utilization and environmental 
adaptability of ruminants. At present, little is known about the influence of 
different extreme environments on the rumen microbiota of yaks. In this study, 
30 ruminal fluid samples from 30 healthy female yaks (average 280 kg of BW) in 
5-8 years of life were collected from three regions in Tibet, China, and 
compared by gas chromatography and high-throughput sequencing. Results showed 
that propionic acid, butyric acid, and total volatile fatty acids were 
significantly (p < 0.05) higher, while microbial abundance and diversity were 
significantly (p < 0.05) lower, in the Nagqu (4,500 m altitude) compared with 
the Xigatse (4,800 m altitude) and Lhasa (3,800 m altitude) regions. Principal 
coordinate analysis revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences in rumen 
microbial composition of yaks from different regions. Specifically, 
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were identified by linear discriminant analysis 
effect size (LDA > 3) as being the signature phyla for Xigatse and Nagqu 
regions, respectively. In addition, the relative abundance of 
Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Quinella, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, 
Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, Papillibacter, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, 
Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 correlated with 
altitude and rumen fermentation parameters (p < 0.05). Finally, the predicted 
function of rumen microbiota was found to differ between regions (p < 0.05). In 
summary, our results reveal that regions located at different altitudes 
influence microbiota composition and fermentation function of yaks' rumen. The 
present findings can provide mechanistic insights on yak adaptation to high 
altitudes and improve the feeding efficiency of these animals in extreme 
regions.

Thalassemia syndromes are the most prevalent monogenic hemoglobinopathy in the 
world. In Iran, thalassemia is a public health problem because this country has 
been located on the thalassemia belt. In recent decades, considering that the 
life expectancy of patients with thalassemia has dramatically improved, some 
unrecognized complications have emerged in these individuals. One of these 
complications is a hypercoagulable state that may lead to thromboembolic events 
(TEE). The TEE may involve any organ in the body, including the central nervous 
system. Ischemic cerebrovascular events in thalassemic patients have been 
divided into two categories, namely overt stroke and silent cerebral infarcts 
(SCI). Overt stroke often develops in patients with beta-thalassemia major; 
however, patients with thalassemia intermedia usually suffer from SCI. This 
review article discusses brain vascular involvement.

Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon characterized by degenerative processes 
closely connected to oxidative damage and chronic inflammation. Recently, many 
studies have shown that natural bioactive compounds are useful in delaying the 
aging process. In this work, we studied the effects of an in vivo 
supplementation of the stilbenoid pterostilbene on lifespan extension in 
Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the average lifespan of flies of both 
sexes was increased by pterostilbene supplementation with a higher effect in 
females. The expression of longevity related genes (Sir2, Foxo, and Notch) was 
increased in both sexes but with different patterns. Pterostilbene counteracted 
oxidative stress induced by ethanol and paraquat and up-regulated the 
antioxidant enzymes Ho e Trxr-1 in male but not in female flies. On the other 
hand, pterostilbene decreased the inflammatory mediators dome and egr only in 
female flies. Proteomic analysis revealed that pterostilbene modulates 113 
proteins in male flies and only 9 in females. Only one of these proteins was 
modulated by pterostilbene in both sexes: vacuolar H[+] ATPase 68 kDa subunit 2 
(Vha68-2) that was strongly down-regulated. These findings suggest a potential 
role of pterostilbene in increasing lifespan both in male and female flies by 
mechanisms that seem to be different in the two sexes, highlighting the need to 
conduct nutraceutical supplementation studies on males and females separately in 
order to give more reliable results.

Infantile haemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign soft tissue tumours in 
children. Usually, they evolve without clinical incurrences and regression of 
the lesion can occur spontaneously in the first years of life. The decision for 
treatment is dependent upon the intrinsic characteristics of the lesion such as 
location, extension, functional compromise and complications. We present the 
case of a newborn who was clinically accessed during ambulatory routine 
consultation when a lesion with 5x5 centimetres compatible with an IH was first 
observed. Inflammatory signs with no active bleeding were present and the 
newborn displayed signs of discomfort during a diaper change and manipulation of 
the anogenital area. For this reason, a referral was made for observation in a 
central hospital with specialised paediatrics, paediatric surgery and 
dermatology support. A 10-day antibiotic course with flucloxacillin and local 
topical care with silver sulfadiazine cream and barrier cream with zinc oxide 
were adopted, achieving a good clinical outcome. Laboratory workup, 
cardiovascular assessment, imagiological investigation with abdominopelvic and 
spinal cord ultrasonography as well as lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging 
were all normal. Ulceration is the most prevalent complication of IHs and it is 
associated with pain, recurrent bleeding, infection and difficult scarring, thus 
early recognition and directed treatment are essential to achieve a good 
clinical outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Maintaining and improving prisoners' health and their 
rehabilitation can be effective steps towards eliminating health inequalities 
and approaching the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Accordingly, identifying 
protective factors and health barriers of this vulnerable group and changing the 
prison into an environment that can deliver health interventions tailored to the 
needs of inmates can provide the basis for attaining justice in health.
PURPOSE: This study builds on an artificial neural network model to determine 
the effect of demographic, psychological, criminological, and physical activity 
factors on prisoners' general health.
METHODS: The study detected the patterns between variables using a neural 
network with nine inputs and one output. To determine the neural network with 
the minimum sum of squared errors, we evaluated the performance of all neural 
networks using varying algorithms and numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. 
For this purpose, the analysis of the data of 149 prisoners aged between 16 and 
61 years was performed using SPSS-22 software.
RESULTS: The optimal neural network model was useful in predicting prisoners' 
general health. In this model, the variables of occupation, life expectancy, 
age, and hope of acceptance were identified as the first most significant 
factors with 19.25, 17.45, 15.98, and 15.16 percentages, respectively, whereas 
the cause of incarceration, education level, type of drug misuse, and physical 
activity were the second most important factors with 8.82, 8.38, 7.91, and 7.04 
percentages, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Experiencing psychosocial pressures related to incarceration is more 
severe for the marginalized and disadvantaged individuals, persons in very young 
or old age ranges, and those with no history of incarceration, which can 
increase the likelihood of impaired health for these inmates. Consideration of 
the prisoners' needs in proportion to their characteristics and provision of 
emotional and spiritual support of the inmates, especially in the early stages 
of incarceration, can help shape an effective adjustment process and select 
appropriate and efficient strategies.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyse the impact of elevated systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) levels on mortality and life expectancy among ≥25 yr adults in the 
municipality of Ningbo, China.
METHODS: The death cause data were collected from the Internet-based 
Comprehensive Chronic Disease Surveillance System in Zhejiang Province in 2015, 
and SBP level data were obtained from the Ningbo Adult Chronic Disease 
Surveillance survey. According to the comparative risk assessment theory, the 
population attributable fraction (PAF) of elevated SBP levels by gender and 
urban-rural regions has been calculated. The deaths and life expectancy loss due 
to elevated SBP levels were estimated.
RESULTS: In 2015, the average SBP level among ≥25 yr adults in Ningbo was 129.01 
± 17.73 mmHg, which was higher in men (131.67 ± 16.89 mmHg) than in women 
(126.24 ± 18.15 mmHg) and was higher among adults in rural regions (130.55 ± 
18.75 mmHg) than among adults in urban regions (127.15 ± 16.19 mmHg). A total of 
6181 deaths were attributed to elevated SBP levels among adults in Ningbo. The 
PAF of deaths caused by elevated SBP levels among adults was 16.14%, which was 
higher in women (18.73%) than in men (14.31%). The overall loss of life 
expectancy caused by elevated SBP levels among adults was 1.76 yr, which was 
higher in women (1.99 yr) than in men (1.53 yr) and was higher in rural regions 
(1.91 yr) than in urban regions (1.49 yr).
CONCLUSION: Elevated SBP levels had a serious impact on the death and life 
expectancy loss of residents in Ningbo.

BACKGROUND: Human hydatidosis as a public concern has increased in a number of 
countries that have reduced control programs for the disease due to lack of 
resources or policies. We aimed to estimate Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs) for human hydatidosis in Iran in 2018.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Center of Communicable Diseases Control, 
Ministry of Health &Medical Education, Tehran, Iran in 2018. To calculate DALYs, 
years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) with years of life with 
disability (YLD) were calculated according to the formula as DALY = YLL + YLD. 
The standard life expectancy lost method (SEYLL) was used to calculate the years 
lost due to premature death.
RESULTS: DALYs for human hydatidosis was calculated as 1210.12 years (YLD equals 
to 177.12 and YLL equals to 1033) in Iran for the year 2018. It was estimated to 
be 700.2 years for men and 509.8 years for women. DALYs in men were 
significantly different from women (P= 0.001) so DALYs were more in men than 
women were. YLD was calculated at 78.228 years in men and 98.892 years in women 
and in both men and women at 177.12 years. YLD was significantly different in 
women compared to men (P=0.001), so YLD in women was more than in men.
CONCLUSION: We reached considerable indices for hydatidosis in our study. 
Therefore, disease prevention and control programs in Iran seem necessary by the 
policy makers.

BACKGROUND: Gender differences in mortality are embedded within mortality 
transitions. Rural residents generally lag behind their urban counterparts in 
the transitions. The study objective is to identify major causes of death that 
drive gender differences in mortality in urban and rural China.
METHODS: We use age-, gender-, urban-rural- and cause-specific mortality data 
(2013-2018) derived from the national mortality surveillance system that covered 
about 24% of the Chinese population. We apply Arriaga's method to decompose age- 
and cause-specific contributions to the gender gap in life expectancy at birth. 
Analyses are stratified by urban-rural residence.
RESULTS: Women had a higher life expectancy at birth than men in both urban and 
rural areas. Cancers, cardiovascular disease, external causes, and respiratory 
disease accounted for more than 90% of the gender gap in both areas during 
2013-2018. In urban areas, the gender gap decreased from 5.17 years in 2013-2015 
to 4.98 years in 2016-2018. In rural areas, the gender gap stayed rather 
constant (2013-2015: 5.68 years; 2016-2018: 5.65 years). Traffic accidents, 
among external causes, contributed the most to decreasing the gender gap (urban: 
-0.07 years; rural: -0.10 years), especially in the 0-44 age group. However, the 
decrease in the gender gap was counteracted by an increase in the gender gap 
attributable to ischemic heart disease (urban: +0.05 years; rural: +0.08 years) 
and lung cancer (urban: +0.02 years; rural: +0.05 years) in older age groups. 
The gender gap attributable either to cerebrovascular disease or to chronic 
lower respiratory disease decreased in urban areas but increased in rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The urban-rural variations in the cause-specific contributions to 
the gender gap in China suggest the necessity of implementing 
urban-rural-specific interventions to improve population health and health 
equity.

As life expectancy increases for Indigenous populations, so does the number of 
older adults with complex, chronic health conditions and age-related geriatric 
syndromes. Many of these conditions are associated with modifiable lifestyle 
factors that, if addressed, may improve the health and wellbeing of Indigenous 
peoples as they age. If models of healthy aging are to be promoted within health 
services, a clearer understanding of what aging well means for Indigenous 
peoples is needed. Indigenous peoples hold a holistic worldview of health and 
aging that likely differs from Western models. The aims of this review were to: 
investigate the literature that exists and where the gaps are, on aging well for 
Indigenous peoples; assess the quality of the existing literature on Indigenous 
aging; identify the domains of aging well for Indigenous peoples; and identify 
the enablers and barriers to aging well for Indigenous peoples. A systematic 
search of online databases, book chapters, gray literature, and websites 
identified 32 eligible publications on Indigenous aging. Reflexive thematic 
analysis identified four major themes on aging well: (1) achieving holistic 
health and wellbeing; (2) maintaining connections; (3) revealing resilience, 
humor, and a positive attitude; and (4) facing the challenges. Findings revealed 
that aging well is a holistic concept enabled by spiritual, physical, and mental 
wellbeing and where reliance on connections to person, place, and culture is 
central. Participants who demonstrated aging well took personal responsibility, 
adapted to change, took a positive attitude to life, and showed resilience. 
Conversely, barriers to aging well arose from the social determinants of health 
such as lack of access to housing, transport, and adequate nutrition. 
Furthermore, the impacts of colonization such as loss of language and culture 
and ongoing grief and trauma all challenged the ability to age well. Knowing 
what aging well means for Indigenous communities can facilitate health services 
to provide culturally appropriate and effective care.

"Blue Zones" are geographical regions where people live to be non-agenarians and 
centenarians with significantly better rates of mental wellness when compared to 
the average American. It was discovered that these areas have nine unique 
evidenced-based lifestyle principles, with one of their main principles being 
the consumption of a plant-based diet. With this in mind, we performed a 
worksite intervention with the objective of understanding the relationships 
among Blue Zones knowledge, a plant-based lifestyle, and improvements in overall 
mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. During spring 2021, we recruited 
52 employees from a public, mid-sized university in the southwestern United 
States to participate in an 8-week virtual intervention that included weekly 
topic presentations, cooking demonstrations, and Blue Zones education. 
Participants were also assigned to weekly wellness counseling groups integrating 
Motivational Interviewing based principles that included additional, relevant 
conversation topics and support. The final sample (n = 52 participants) had a 
mean age of 45.6 ± 10.6 years. Participants were predominantly women (84.6%) and 
nearly half were married (44.2%). The majority attended graduate school (59.6%) 
and identified as White (84.6%). Paired-samples t-tests indicated significant 
improvements in all mental wellness outcomes and Healthy Eating Index-2015 
(HEI-2015) scores over time (p's < 0.001 to 0.02). Multiple linear regression 
models revealed that Blue Zones knowledge (β = -0.037, p = 0.010) significantly 
negatively predicted Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores at 8-weeks. 
Additionally, multiple linear regression models indicated small group attendance 
(β = -1.51, p = 0.003) and Blue Zones knowledge (β = -0.81, p = 0.012) 
significantly negatively predicted sleep scores at 8-weeks. When HEI-2015 total 
scores were also included at baseline and 8-weeks (post-intervention), Blue 
Zones knowledge (β = -0.031, p = 0.049) was a borderline significant predictor 
of PHQ-9 at 8-weeks. Additionally, small group sessions (β = -1.52 p = 0.005) 
were a significant predictor of sleep at 8-weeks. The intervention illustrated 
that virtual intervention strategies can improve nutrition and mental wellness 
for future advancement in life quality and wellbeing.

Glioblastoma represents the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system. 
Due to invasion of glioblastoma stem cells into the healthy tissue, 
chemoresistance, and recurrence of the tumor, it is difficult to successfully 
treat glioblastoma patients, which is demonstrated by the low life expectancy of 
patients after standard therapy treatment. Recently, we found that 
diisothiocyanate-derived mercapturic acids, which are isothiocyanate derivatives 
from plants of the Cruciferae family, provoked a decrease in glioblastoma cell 
viability. These findings were extended by combining diisothiocyanate-derived 
mercapturic acids with dinaciclib (a small-molecule inhibitor of 
cyclin-dependent kinases with anti-proliferative capacity) or temozolomide (TMZ, 
standard chemotherapeutic agent) to test whether the components have a cytotoxic 
effect on glioblastoma cells when the dosage is low. Here, we demonstrate that 
the combination of diisothiocyanate-derived mercapturic acids with dinaciclib or 
TMZ had an additive or even synergistic effect in the restriction of cell growth 
dependent on the combination of the components and the glioblastoma cell source. 
This strategy could be applied to inhibit glioblastoma cell growth as a 
therapeutic interference of glioblastoma.

Even though the web environment facilitates our daily life, emotional problems 
caused by its incompatibility with human cognition are becoming increasingly 
serious. To alleviate negative emotions during web use, we developed a browser 
extension that presents memorized product images to users in the form of web 
advertisements. This system utilizes the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control 
of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) as a model of human memory and emotion. A heart rate 
sensor attached to the user modulates the ACT-R model parameters, and the 
emotional states represented by the model are synchronized (following the 
chameleon effect) or counterbalanced (following the homeostasis regulation) with 
the physiological state of the user. An experiment demonstrates that the 
counterbalanced model suppresses negative ruminative web browsing. The authors 
claim that this approach, utilizing a cognitive model, is advantageous in terms 
of explainability.

Grassland Administration, Beijing 100091, China.

To explore the differences between growth and population dynamics of natural 
Lycorma delicatula in the plantations and semi-natural forests, the susceptible 
stages and major suppression factors were determined to provide basis for the 
prediction and controlling the pest. The development duration and life table of 
L. delicatula in different habitats were established by using tracking method. 
The index of exclusion effect for lethal factors and the K-value in each 
development stage were calculated. The population trends were analyzed through 
the survival curve and key drivers of population change. The results showed that 
the development duration of L. delicatula in the plantation habitat and 
semi-natural habitat was significantly different, with thelatter being 25.7 d 
longer than the former. There were significant differences in the development 
duration of 1st-3rd-instars nymphs and pre-oviposition period of adults between 
these two habitats, but no significant difference in the 4th-instar nymphs. The 
total mortality rate in the plantation habitat and semi-natural habitat was 
83.6% and 98.6%, respectively. The index of population trend in the plantation 
habitat was significantly higher than that in the semi-natural habitat. The 
population of L. delicatula increased sharply in the plantation habitat, but 
showed a decline trend in the semi-natural habitat. All of the survival curves 
of L. delicatula were Deevey-Ⅲ type, and the EIPCs of the "parasitic natural 
enemies" in egg stage were the highest in both habitats as 1.3 and 1.6, and the 
total K values were 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. The regression slopes of K-value 
of natural enemies were the highest (both 0.6). These findings revealed that the 
semi-natural habitat played an important role in the natural regulation of L. 
delicatula.

The value of psychotherapy in surgical patients suffering from postoperative 
delirium is unclear. Options for the treatment of established postoperative 
delirium are few; therapy largely relies on the avoidance of postoperative 
delirium facilitating factors, like specific drugs and environmental factors in 
the perioperative setting. Established medical therapies' efficacy in terms of 
decreasing incidence of postoperative delirium is very low. The aim of this 
project is to suggest new therapeutic options in the form of cognitive 
behavioural therapy as a possible preventive and psychotherapeutic treatment of 
postoperative delirium. Life expectancy in developed countries increases 
worldwide and both the need for surgical treatment and the probability of 
postoperative delirium occurrence increase with age. Due to the necessity of 
addressing the individual's negative consequences of postoperative delirium and 
to optimise socioeconomical needs, new therapeutic options for the treatment of 
postoperative delirium are desperately needed.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) can present with various physical and 
psychological symptoms and functional deficits that impact their quality of 
life. Virtual reality (VR) technology is being used in breast cancer 
rehabilitation management to improve the emotional, cognitive, and physical 
well-being of BCSs.
