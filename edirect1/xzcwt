BACKGROUND: As life expectancy of patients infected with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) approaches that of the general population, the composition of HIV 
management costs is likely to change.
OBJECTIVES: To (a) review treatment and disease management costs in HIV, 
including costs of adverse events (AEs) related to antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
and long-term toxicities, and (b) explore the evolving cost drivers.
METHODS: A targeted literature review between January 2012 and November 2017 was 
conducted using PubMed and major conferences. Articles reporting U.S. costs of 
HIV management, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events, end 
of life care, and ART-associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and osteoporosis were included. All costs 
were inflated to 2017 U.S. dollars. A Markov model-based analysis was conducted 
to estimate the effect of increased life expectancy on costs associated with HIV 
treatment and management.
RESULTS: 22 studies describing HIV costs in the United States were identified, 
comprising 16 cost-effectiveness analysis studies, 5 retrospective analyses of 
health care utilization, and 1 cost analysis in a resource-limited setting. 
Management costs per patient per month, including routine care costs (on/off 
ART), non-HIV medication, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, inpatient 
utilization, outpatient utilization, and emergency department utilization were 
reported as CD4+ cell-based health state costs ranging from $1,192 for patients 
with CD4 > 500 cells/mm3 to $2,873 for patients with CD4 < 50 cells/mm3. Event 
costs for AEs ranged from $0 for headache, pain, vomiting, and lipodystrophy to 
$31,545 for myocardial infarction. The mean monthly per-patient costs for CVD 
management, CKD management, and osteoporosis were $5,898, $6,108, and $4,365, 
respectively. Improvements in life expectancy, approaching that of the general 
population in 2018, are projected to increase ART-related and AE costs by 35.4% 
and comorbidity costs by 175.8% compared with estimated costs with HIV life 
expectancy observed in 1996.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified and summarized holistic cost estimates 
appropriate for use within U.S. HIV cost-effectiveness analyses and demonstrates 
an increasing contribution of comorbidity outcomes, primarily associated with 
aging in addition to long-term treatment with ART, not typically evaluated in 
contemporary HIV cost-effectiveness analyses.

Skin crack defects can develop in sandwich honeycomb composite structures during 
service life due to static and impact loads. In this study, the fracture 
behavior of sandwich honeycomb composite (SHC) beams containing crack at the 
skin was investigated experimentally and numerically under four-point loading. 
Three different arrangements of unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber composite and 
the triaxially woven (TW) fabric were considered for the skins. The presence of 
a 10 mm crack at mid-span of the top skin, mid-span of the bottom skin, and 
mid-way between load and support of the top skin, respectively, were considered. 
Failure load equations of the load initiating the skin crack extension were 
analytically derived and then numerically developed using the J-integral 
approach. The crack extension failure mode dominated all cracked specimens 
except those with low-stiffness skin which were controlled by the compressive 
skin debonding and core shear failures.

We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating acute hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) vs deferring treatment until the chronic phase and (2) treating all 
chronic patients vs only those with advanced fibrosis; among Chinese genotype 1b 
treatment-naïve patients who injected drugs (PWID), using a combination 
Daclatasvir (DCV) plus Asunaprevir (ASV) regimen and a Peg-interferon 
(PegIFN)-based regimen, respectively. A decision-analytical model including the 
risk of HCV reinfection simulated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) of three treatment timings, under the DCV+ASV and PegIFN regimen, 
respectively: Treating acute infection ("Treat at acute"), treating chronic 
patients of all fibrosis stages ("Treat at F0 (no fibrosis)"), treating only 
advanced-stage fibrosis patients ("Treat at F3 (numerous septa without 
cirrhosis)"). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare 
scenarios. "Treat at acute" compared with "Treat at F0" was cost-saving (cost: 
DCV+ASV regimen-US$14,486.975 vs US$16,224.250; PegIFN-based 
regimen-US$19,734.794 vs US$22,101.584) and more effective (QALY: DCV+ASV 
regimen-14.573 vs 14.566; PegIFN-based regimen-14.148 vs 14.116). Compared with 
"Treat at F3"; "Treat at F0" exhibited an ICER of US$3780.20/QALY and 
US$15,145.98/QALY under the DCV+ASV regimen and PegIFN-based regimen; 
respectively. Treatment of acute HCV infection was highly cost-effective and 
cost-saving compared with deferring treatment to the chronic stage; for both 
DCV+ASV and PegIFN-based regimens. Early treatment for chronic patients with 
DCV+ASV regimen was highly cost-effective.

The most common malignant brain tumors are those of astrocytic origin, gliomas, 
with the most aggressive glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) among them. Despite 
efforts, medicine has not made progress in terms of the prognosis and life 
expectancy of glioma patients. Behind the malignant phenotype of gliomas lies 
multiple genetic mutations leading to reprogramming of their metabolism, which 
gives those highly proliferating cells an advantage over healthy ones. The 
so-called glutamine addiction is a metabolic adaptation that supplements 
oxidative glycolysis in order to secure neoplastic cells with nutrients and 
energy in unfavorable conditions of hypoxia. The present review aims at 
presenting the research and clinical attempts targeting the different metabolic 
pathways involved in glutamine metabolism in gliomas. A brief description of the 
biochemistry of glutamine transport, synthesis, and glutaminolysis, etc. will 
forego a detailed comparison of the therapeutic strategies undertaken to inhibit 
glutamine utilization by gliomas.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) frequently seen chronic synovial inflammation causing 
joint destruction, chronic disability and reduced life expectancy. The 
pathogenesis of RA is not completely known. In this study, several gene 
expression data including synovial tissue and macrophages from synovial tissues 
were integrated with a holistic perspective and the molecular targets and 
signatures in RA were determined. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified from each dataset by comparing diseased and healthy samples. 
Afterward, the RA-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) and the 
transcriptional regulatory network were reconstructed by using several 
biomolecule interaction data. Key biomolecules were determined through a 
statistical test employing the hypergeometric probability density function by 
using the physical interactions of transcriptional regulators and PPI. The 
integrative analyses of DEGs indicated that there were 110 and 494 common genes 
between synovial tissues and macrophages related datasets, respectively. Common 
DEGs of all datasets were identified as 25 genes and these core genes which 
might be feasible to uncover the mutual biological mechanism insights behind the 
RA pathogenesis were used for disease specific biological networks 
reconstruction. It was determined the hub proteins, novel key biomolecules (i.e. 
receptor, transcription factors and miRNAs) and biomolecules interactions by 
using the core DEGs. It was identified STAT1, RAC2 and KYNU as hub proteins, 
PEPD as a receptor, NR4A1, MEOX2, KLF4, IRF1 and MYB as TFs, miR-299, miR-8078, 
miR-146a, miR-3659 and miR-6882 as key miRNAs. It was determined that 
biomolecule interaction scenarios using identified key biomolecules and novel 
biomolecules including RAC2, PEPD, NR4A1, MEOX2, miR-299, miR-8078, miR-3659 and 
miR-6882 in RA. Our novel findings could be a crucial resource for the 
understanding of RA molecular mechanism and may be considered as drug targets 
and development of novel diagnostic strategies. Corresponding genes and miRNAs 
should be validated via experimental studies.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend considering life expectancy before 
aortic valve replacement (AVR). We compared the performance of a general 
mortality index, the Lee index, to a frailty index.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 246 older adults undergoing 
surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at a single 
academic medical center. We compared performance of the Lee index to a deficit 
accumulation frailty index (FI). Logistic regression was used to assess the 
association of Lee index or FI with poor outcome, defined as death or functional 
decline with severe symptoms at 12 months. Discrimination was assessed using 
C-statistics.
RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 44 experienced poor outcome (31 deaths, 13 
functional decline with severe symptoms). The risk of poor outcome by Lee index 
quartiles was 6.8% (reference), 17.9% (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence 
interval, [0.9-10.2]), 20.0% (OR 3.4; [1.0-11.4]), and 34.0% (OR 7.1; 
[2.2-22.6]) (p-for-trend = 0.001). Risk of poor outcome by FI quartiles was 3.6% 
(reference), 10.3% (OR 3.1; [0.6-15.8]), 25.0% (OR 8.8; [1.9-41.0]), and 37.3% 
(OR 15.8; [3.5-71.1]) (p-for-trend< 0.001). The Lee index predicted the risk of 
poor outcome in the SAVR cohort Lee index (quartiles 1-4: 2.1, 4.0, 15.4, and 
20.0%; p-for-trend = 0.04), but not in the TAVR cohort (quartiles 1-4: 27.3, 
29.0, 21.3, 35.4%; p-for-trend = 0.42). In contrast, the FI did not predict the 
risk of poor outcome well in the SAVR cohort (quartiles 1-4: 2.3, 4.4, 15.8, and 
0%; p-for-trend = 0.24), however in the TAVR cohort (quartiles 1-4: 9.1, 14.3, 
29.7, and 40.7%; p-for-trend = 0.004). Compared to the Lee index, an FI 
demonstrated higher C-statistics in the overall (Lee index versus FI: 0.680 
versus 0.735; p = 0.03) and TAVR (0.560 versus 0.644; p = 0.03) cohorts, but not 
SAVR cohort (0.724 versus 0.766; p = 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: While a general mortality index Lee index predicted death or 
functional decline with severe symptoms at 12 months well among SAVR patients, 
the FI derived from a multi-domain geriatric assessment better informs 
risk-stratification for high-risk TAVR patients.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a relatively common genetic disease, with a 
prevalence ranging between 1/3000 and 1/6000 people worldwide. The disease 
affects multiple systems with cutaneous, neurologic, and orthopedic as major 
manifestations which lead to significant morbidity or mortality. Indeed, NF1 
patients are at an increased risk of malignancy and have a life expectancy about 
10-15 years shorter than the general population. The mainstay of management of 
NF1 is a patient-centered longitudinal care with age-specific monitoring of 
clinical manifestations, aiming at the early recognition and symptomatic 
treatment of complications as they occur. Protocole national de diagnostic et de 
soins (PNDS) are mandatory French clinical practice guidelines for rare diseases 
required by the French national plan for rare diseases. Their purpose is to 
provide health care professionals with guidance regarding the optimal diagnostic 
and therapeutic management of patients affected with a rare disease; and thus, 
harmonizing their management nationwide. PNDS are usually developed through a 
critical literature review and a multidisciplinary expert consensus. The purpose 
of this article is to present the French guidelines on NF1, making them even 
more available to the international medical community. We further dwelled on the 
emerging new evidence that might have therapeutic potential or a strong impact 
on NF1 management in the coming feature. Given the complexity of the disease, 
the management of children and adults with NF1 entails the full complement 
healthcare providers and communication among the various specialties.

Pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) has extended the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH). An 
unfortunate side effect of HIV treatment, however, is an increased prevalence of 
dyslipidemia, glycemic dysregulation and abnormal distribution of body fat 
(lipodystrophy). Consequently, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is significantly increased in PLWH and ultimately a major cause of 
mortality. Physical activity and exercise training are interventions that have 
effectively protected against the development of CVD and, in the presence of 
CVD, has help mitigate morbidity and mortality. Early concerns over potential 
immunosuppressive effects of exercise in PLWH have largely been dispelled and in 
some cases exercise has been shown to strengthen markers of immune function. 
Interventions with aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and their combination, 
particularly at higher intensities, are showing promising health outcomes in 
PLWH. This review will summarize the key cardiovascular and metabolic effects of 
antiretroviral therapy; the effects of the types and intensities of exercise on 
cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic markers, and muscle strength; and 
provide recommendations on strategies to apply exercise interventions in 
clinical settings.

In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has become a 
manageable disease marked by an elevated risk of non-AIDS-related comorbidities, 
including stroke. Rates of stroke are higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) 
compared with the general population. Elevated stroke risk may be attributable 
to traditional risk factors, HIV-associated chronic inflammation and immune 
dysregulation, and possible adverse effects of long-standing ART use. Tailoring 
stroke prevention strategies for PLWH requires knowledge of how stroke 
pathogenesis may differ from non-HIV-associated stroke, knowledge of long-term 
stroke outcomes in HIV, and accurate stroke risk assessment tools. As a result, 
the approach to primary and secondary stroke prevention in PLWH relies heavily 
on guidelines developed for the general population, with an emphasis on 
optimization of traditional vascular risk factors and early initiation of ART. 
This review summarizes existing evidence on HIV-associated stroke mechanisms and 
considerations for stroke prevention for PLWH.

OBJECTIVE: A translational trial evaluated the effectiveness of screening for 
inhibited childhood temperament, followed by a preventive parenting program 
-Cool Little Kids. This study determined the cost-effectiveness from societal 
and health sector perspectives using trial data.
METHOD: Resources to deliver the screening and parenting sessions were 
determined from study records. Parents completed a questionnaire reporting 
resources used at one-year follow-up. Standard Australian unit costs were 
applied. Clinical outcomes for children and parental quality adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Total societal costs were lower, but non-significant for the 
intervention compared to the control group (mean difference -$500 p = 0.937). 
Total health sector costs were significantly greater (mean difference $1,956; 
p = 0.015). The intervention led to significantly fewer internalising symptoms 
(Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-emotional difficulties adjusted 
mean difference -0.5; p = 0.006), fewer children with SDQ-emotional symptoms in 
the abnormal range (24.2 % vs. 33.0 % p = .014) and fewer with diagnosed anxiety 
(44.2 % vs. 50.2 % p = 0.427). From the societal perspective, the intervention 
would likely be cost-effective. Health sector ICERs were $1,171/SDQ-emotional 
symptom decrease, $51/abnormal SDQ avoided and $77/anxiety case avoided.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic analysis alongside an implementation study provides 
an early indication that Cool Little Kids may be cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: It is underweight, rather than overweight or obesity, that has been 
a pressing public health concern in Japan. This study examines the impact of 
being underweight on the health of older Japanese men and women, measured by 
active life expectancy at age 65. Following the Japanese government's guideline, 
underweight in this study is defined using the body mass index (BMI) value of 
20.
METHOD: Data came from five waves (1999-2009) of the Nihon University Japanese 
Longitudinal Study of Aging (NUJLSOA). We used the Interpolation of Markov Chain 
approach to estimate the number of years underweight (BMI < 20), normal weight 
(20 < BMI < 25), and overweight (25 < BMI) individuals were expected to live 
without difficulty in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs.
RESULTS: We found differences in life and health expectancies across the three 
weight categories. Underweight people were expected to live the shortest lives 
and spend the fewest years in an active state compared with normal and 
overweight individuals. Results remained unchanged even when accounting for 
educational attainment, smoking history, and a count of existing chronic 
conditions.
DISCUSSION: Being underweight is associated with poor quality of life lived 
among Japanese older adults. This finding suggests the importance of maintaining 
proper weight and avoids nutritional risks at advanced ages.

The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) has converted 
the prognosis of HIV infection from a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal 
disease to a chronic condition with limited impact on life expectancy. Yet, 
HIV-infected patients remain at high risk for critical illness due to the 
occurrence of severe opportunistic infections in those with advanced 
immunosuppression (i.e., inaugural admissions or limited access to cART), a 
pronounced susceptibility to bacterial sepsis and tuberculosis at every stage of 
HIV infection, and a rising prevalence of underlying comorbidities such as 
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, atherosclerosis or non-AIDS-defining 
neoplasms in cART-treated patients aging with controlled viral replication. 
Several patterns of intensive care have markedly evolved in this patient 
population over the late cART era, including a steady decline in AIDS-related 
admissions, an opposite trend in admissions for exacerbated comorbidities, the 
emergence of additional drivers of immunosuppression (e.g., anti-neoplastic 
chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation), the management of cART in the 
acute phase of critical illness, and a dramatic progress in short-term survival 
that mainly results from general advances in intensive care practices. Besides, 
there is a lack of data regarding other features of ICU and post-ICU care in 
these patients, especially on the impact of sociological factors on clinical 
presentation and prognosis, the optimal timing of cART introduction in 
AIDS-related admissions, determinants of end-of-life decisions, long-term 
survival, and functional outcomes. In this narrative review, we sought to depict 
the current evidence regarding the management of HIV-infected patients admitted 
to the intensive care unit.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Given that the life expectancy and the burden of hypertension 
are projected to increase over the next decade, hypertensive heart disease (HHD) 
may be expected to play an even more central role in the pathophysiology of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). A broader understanding of the features and 
underlying mechanisms that constitute HHD therefore is of paramount importance.
RECENT FINDINGS: HHD is a condition that arises as a result of elevated blood 
pressure and constitutes a key underlying mechanism for cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality. Historically, studies investigating HHD have primarily focused on 
left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), but it is increasingly apparent that 
HHD encompasses a range of target-organ damage beyond LVH, including other 
cardiovascular structural and functional adaptations that may occur separately 
or concomitantly. HHD is characterized by micro- and macroscopic myocardial 
alterations, structural phenotypic adaptations, and functional changes that 
include cardiac fibrosis, and the remodeling of the atria and ventricles and the 
arterial system. In this review, we summarize the structural and functional 
alterations in the cardiac and vascular system that constitute HHD and 
underscore their underlying pathophysiology.

Non-endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare germinal centre B-cell-derived 
malignancy with the genetic hallmark of MYC gene translocation and with rapid 
tumour growth as a distinct clinical feature. To investigate treatment outcomes, 
loss of lifetime and relapse risk in adult BL patients treated with intensive 
immunochemotherapy, retrospective clinic-based and population-based lymphoma 
registries from six countries were used to identify 264 real-world patients. The 
median age was 47 years and the majority had advanced-stage disease and elevated 
LDH. Treatment protocols were R-CODOX-M/IVAC (47%), R-hyper-CVAD (16%), 
DA-EPOCH-R (11%), R-BFM/GMALL (25%) and other (2%) leading to an overall 
response rate of 89%. The two-year overall survival and event-free survival were 
84% and 80% respectively. For patients in complete remission/unconfirmed, the 
two-year relapse risk was 6% but diminished to 0·6% for patients reaching 
12 months of post-remission event-free survival (pEFS12). The loss of lifetime 
for pEFS12 patients was 0·4 (95% CI: -0·7 to 2) months. In conclusion, 
real-world outcomes of adult BL are excellent following intensive 
immunochemotherapy. For pEFS12 patients, the relapse risk was low and life 
expectancy similar to that of a general population, which is important 
information for developing meaningful follow-up strategies with increased focus 
on survivorship and less focus on routine disease surveillance.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk for 
recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). We aimed to evaluate the 
potential health economic and clinical outcomes of four strategies for 
management of RCDI in IBD patients from the perspective of public health-care 
provider in Hong Kong.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of adult 
IBD patients with first RCDI treated with vancomycin, vancomycin plus 
bezlotoxumab, fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Model 
inputs were derived from literature and public data. Primary model outcomes were 
C. difficile infection (CDI)-related direct medical cost and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) loss. Base-case and sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Comparing to vancomycin, fidaxomicin and vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab, 
FMT saved 0.00318, 0.00149 and 0.00306 QALYs and reduced cost by USD3180, 
USD3790 and USD5514, respectively, in base-case analysis. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, FMT was cost-saving when comparing to vancomycin, 
fidaxomicin and vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab by USD3765 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 3732-3798; P < 0.001), USD3854 (95%CI 3827-3883; P < 0.001) and USD6501 
(95%CI 6465-6,536; P < 0.001), respectively. The QALYs saved by FMT (vs 
vancomycin) were 0.00386 QALYs (95%CI 0.00384-0.00388; P < 0.001), (vs 
fidaxomicin) 0.00179 QALYs (95%CI 0.00177-0.00180; P < 0.001) and (vs vancomycin 
plus bezlotoxumab) 0.00376 QALYs (95%CI 0.00374-0.00378; P < 0.001). FMT was 
found to save QALYs at lower cost in 99.3% (vs vancomycin), 99.7% (vs 
fidaxomicin) and 100.0% (vs vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab) of the 10 000 Monte 
Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT for IBD patients with RCDI appeared to save both direct medical 
cost and QALYs when comparing to vancomycin (with or without bezlotoxumab) and 
fidaxomicin.

The RNA-templated extension of oligoribonucleotides by nucleotides produces 
either a 3',5' or a 2',5'-phosphodiester. Nature controls the regioselectivity 
during RNA chain growth with polymerases, but enzyme-free versions of genetic 
copying have modest specificity. Thus far, enzymatic degradation of products, 
combined with chromatography or electrophoresis, has been the preferred mode of 
detecting 2',5'-diesters produced in enzyme-free reactions. This approach hinges 
on the substrate specificity of nucleases, and is not suitable for in situ 
monitoring. Here we report how 1 H NMR spectroscopy can be used to detect the 
extension of self-templating RNA hairpins and that this reveals the 
regioisomeric nature of the newly formed phosphodiesters. We studied several 
modes of activating nucleotides, including imidazolides, a pyridinium phosphate, 
an active ester, and in situ activation with carbodiimide and organocatalyst. 
Conversion into the desired extension product ranged from 20 to 90 %, depending 
on the leaving group. Integration of the resonances of H1' protons of riboses 
and H5 protons of pyrimidines gave regioselectivities ranging from 40:60 to 
85:15 (3',5' to 2',5' diester), but no simple correlation between 3',5' 
selectivity and yield. Our results show how monitoring with a high-resolution 
technique sheds a new light on a process that may have played an important role 
during the emergence of life.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United 
States, few studies have assessed the impact of obesity on haemophilia-specific 
outcomes or experiences/perceptions of healthcare providers (HCPs) treating 
haemophilia.
AIM: The Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity maNagement to inform 
Haemophilia Obesity Patient Empowerment (ACTION-TO-HOPE) study was designed to 
identify HCP insights on the unique challenges of patients with haemophilia and 
obesity/overweight (PwHO) and the barriers to chronic weight management.
METHODS: An online survey collected data from haemophilia treatment centre-based 
HCPs. Respondents included 10 adults and 29 paediatric haematologists, 27 
nurses/nurse practitioners/physician assistants, 22 physical therapists and 17 
social workers.
RESULTS: Almost all HCPs rated obesity of moderate/high concern and reported 
that weight significantly affects future health and has an impact on life 
expectancy, yet fewer than 60% reported discussing the impact of weight on 
health with their patients. HCPs reported that few PwHO tried to lose weight; 
not many were 'successful'. HCPs perceived a desire to feel better physically 
and joint pain as top motivating factors. HCPs believe that PwHO would have less 
joint bleeding and pain and greater mobility if they lost weight. HCPs viewed 
lack of exercise and food preferences/habits as the biggest barriers to 
initiating/maintaining weight loss and therefore recommended increasing exercise 
and healthier eating to their patients. However, physical activity in this 
patient population is limited and requires advice and support.
CONCLUSIONS: Most HCPs appreciated the impact of obesity on joint bleeding, 
pain, and function and quality of life. Reduced food intake and increased 
activity are the most commonly recommended weight-loss strategies but the least 
likely to be successful. HCPs desire additional education/materials to 
understand weight management for PwHO.

INTRODUCTION: Attempts to find an association between male circumcision and 
prostate cancer risk have produced inconsistent results.
METHODS: Age-standardized prostate cancer incidence, life-expectancy, 
geographical region, and circumcision prevalence from 188 countries were 
compared using linear regression analysis. Following a systematic literature 
review, a meta-analysis was performed on studies meeting inclusion criteria with 
evaluations of between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. A cost analysis 
(discounted at 3% and 5% per annum) was performed using the meta-analysis's 
summary effect and upper confidence interval.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a trend for a positive association between 
country-level age-standardized prostate cancer incidence (per 100 000 
person-years) and circumcision prevalence (β=0.0887; 95% confidence interval 
[CI)]-0.0560, +0.233), while multivariate analysis found a significant positive 
association (β=0.215; 95% CI 0.114, 0.316). Twelve studies were included in 
meta-analysis. The random-effects summary odds ratio of the risk of being 
genitally intact was 1.10 (95% CI 0.96, 1.26, between-study heterogeneity χ2 
15=27.43; p=0.03; I2=82.8%). There was no evidence of publication bias. Cost 
analysis found infant circumcision was prohibitively costly, returning only 
between 1.6¢ and 13.8¢ for each dollar expended.
CONCLUSIONS: Circumcision may be a positive risk factor on geographical 
analysis, but not in case-case-controlled studies. Circumcision is not 
economically feasible for preventing prostate cancer.

population. The most common physical illnesses amongst patients with 
schizophrenia are metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of
