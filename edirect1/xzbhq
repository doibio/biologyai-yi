Parasitoid's performance is subject to parasitism decisions influenced by host 
quality and parasitoid's age. We evaluated parasitism, emergence, and the 
progeny sex ratio proportions of Telenomus podisi (Ashmead), Trissolcus urichi 
(Crawford), and Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) 
females of different age attacking Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood) (Hemiptera: 
Pentatomidae), an important soybean pest. Eggs were offered to females of T. 
podisi 1-10 d old, T. urichi 1, 3, 4, or 6 d old, or T. basalis 1-6 or 8 d old. 
Average egg parasitism proportions were 0.71 and 0.79 to T. podisi and T. 
urichi, respectively; and preimaginal survivorship was >97% for both species. 
Trissolcus basalis females 1, 2, and 3 d old did not parasitize P. guildinii 
eggs, and high parasitism proportions were recorded from older females, but only 
0.5 of females attacked host eggs. A greater proportion of males were produced 
in the progeny of T. podisi and T. urichi as maternal age increased, but no 
differences were found in the progeny of T. basalis wasps of different ages. The 
results from this study indicate that performance of T. podisi and T. urichi 
would not be affected by the age of the females. However, aging would induce T. 
basalis females to attack P. guildinii, although it is known that their main 
host is Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Under certain 
circumstances, such as shortage of preferred host availability, high egg load, 
and short life expectancy, this wasp may include P. guildinii as a host.

A marked increase in the frequency of obesity at the population level has 
resulted in an increasing number of obese women entering pregnancy. The 
increasing realization of the importance of the fetal environment in relation to 
chronic disease across the lifespan has focused attention on the role of 
maternal obesity in fetal development. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
obesity during adolescence and adulthood can be traced back to fetal and early 
childhood exposures. This review focuses on factors that contribute to early 
developmental events, such as epigenetic modifications, the potential for an 
increase in inflammatory burden, early developmental programming changes such as 
the variable development of white versus brown adipose tissue, and alterations 
in organ ontogeny. We hypothesize that these mechanisms promote an unfavorable 
fetal environment and can have a long-standing impact, with early manifestations 
of chronic disease that can result in an increased demand for future health 
care. In order to identify appropriate preventive measures, attention needs to 
be placed both on reducing maternal obesity as well as understanding the 
molecular, cellular, and epigenetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the 
prenatal onset of chronic disease.

BACKGROUND: A review of the literature determined that our understanding of the 
efficacy of flexible work arrangements (FWA) in reducing work-family conflict 
remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To shed light on this issue by examining the relationship between 
work-to-family conflict, in which work interferes with family (WFC), 
family-to-work conflict, in which family interferes with work (FWC), and four 
work arrangements: the traditional 9-5 schedule, compressed work weeks (CWWs) 
flextime, and telework.
METHODS: Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 16,145 employees with dependent 
care responsibilities. MANCOVA analysis was used with work arrangement as the 
independent variable and work interferes with family (WFC) and family interferes 
with work (FWC) as dependent variables. Work demands, non-work demands, income, 
job type and gender were entered into the analysis as covariates.
RESULTS: The more flexible work arrangements such as flextime and telework were 
associated with higher levels of WFC than were fixed 9-to 5 and CWW schedules. 
Employees who teleworked reported higher FWC than their counterparts working a 
traditional 9-to-5 schedule particularly when work demands were high.
CONCLUSIONS: The removal of both temporal and physical boundaries separating 
work and family domains results in higher levels of work-family interference in 
both directions. The results from this study suggest that policy makers and 
practitioners who are interested in improving employee well-being can reduce 
work-family conflict, and by extension improve employee mental health, by 
focusing on the effective use of traditional and CWW schedules rather than by 
implementing flextime and telework arrangements.

OBJECTIVE: In many high-income countries with low HIV prevalence, significant 
numbers of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) remain undiagnosed. Identification of 
PLHIV via HIV testing offers timely access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) and decreases HIV transmission. We estimated the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of HIV testing in the United Kingdom (UK), where 25% of PLHIV 
are estimated to be undiagnosed.
DESIGN: We developed a dynamic compartmental model to analyze strategies to 
expand HIV testing and treatment in the UK, with particular focus on men who 
have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), and individuals from 
HIV-endemic countries.
METHODS: We estimated HIV prevalence, incidence, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and health care costs over 10 years, and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Annual HIV testing of all adults could avert 5% of new infections, even 
with no behavior change following HIV diagnosis because of earlier ART 
initiation, or up to 18% if risky behavior is halved. This strategy costs 
£67,000-£106,000/QALY gained. Providing annual testing only to MSM, PWID, and 
people from HIV-endemic countries, and one-time testing for all other adults, 
prevents 4-15% of infections, requires one-fourth as many tests to diagnose each 
PLHIV, and costs £17,500/QALY gained. Augmenting this program with increased ART 
access could add 145,000 QALYs to the population over 10 years, at £26,800/QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Annual HIV testing of key populations in the UK is very 
cost-effective. Additional one-time testing of all other adults could identify 
the majority of undiagnosed PLHIV. These findings are potentially relevant to 
other low-prevalence, high-income countries.

IMPORTANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency (BVD) causes chronic imbalance and 
unsteady vision and greatly increases the risk of falls; however, its effects on 
quality of life and economic impact are not well defined.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify disease-specific and health-related quality of life, 
health care utilization, and economic impact on individuals with BVD in 
comparison with those with unilateral vestibular deficiency (UVD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional survey study of patients with 
BVD or UVD and healthy controls at an academic medical center. Vestibular 
dysfunction was diagnosed by means of caloric nystagmography.
INTERVENTIONS: Survey questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health status was measured using the Dizziness 
Handicap Index (DHI) and Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Economic burden was 
estimated using participant responses to questions on disease-specific health 
care utilization and lost productivity.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients with BVD, 22 with UVD, and 23 healthy controls 
participated. In comparison with patients with UVD and controls, patients with 
BVD had significantly worse DHI (P < .001) and HUI3 scores. Statistically 
significant between-group differences were observed for overall HUI3 score 
(P < .001) and for specific attributes including vision, hearing, ambulation, 
emotion, and pain (P < .001 for all). Generalized linear model analysis of 
clinical variables associated with HUI3 scores after adjustment for other 
variables (including sex, race, education, age, and frequency of 
dizziness-related outpatient clinic visits) showed that the presence of UVD 
(P < .001) or BVD (P < .001), increased dizziness-related emergency room visits 
(P = .002), and increased dizziness-related missed work days (P < .001) were 
independently associated with worse HUI3 scores. Patients with BVD and UVD 
incurred estimated mean (range) annual economic burdens of $13,019 ($0-$48,830) 
and $3531 ($0-$48,442) per patient, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency significantly 
decreases quality of life and imposes substantial economic burdens on 
individuals and society. These results underscore the limits of adaptation and 
compensation in BVD. Furthermore, they quantify the potential benefits of 
prosthetic restoration of vestibular function both to these individuals and to 
society.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, 
affecting one in eight women. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has become a 
well-established alternative to mastectomy in the treatment of breast cancer, 
providing a less invasive treatment. Just as life expectancy after breast cancer 
has improved, so has morbidity increased. One of the most relevant and 
debilitating consequences of oncological breast surgery is postmastectomy pain 
syndrome (PMPS). Our results published in 2011 on the treatment of PMPS in 
patients who had undergone mastectomy and radiotherapy and our experience in 
scar treatment with fat grafts were the theoretical bases for this prospective 
study.
METHODS: From April 2011 to April 2012 a total of 96 patients, who had undergone 
lumpectomy and radiation therapy, with the diagnosis of PMPS were considered for 
fat grafts. We performed autologous fat grafting in 59 patients (study group), 
whereas 37 patients did not receive any further surgical procedure (control 
group). Pain assessment was performed using the visual analog scale (VAS) before 
and after treatment in the treated group and in the control group at the first 
visit and the control visit, with a mean follow-up of 10 months. Results were 
analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS: Four patients were lost to follow-up (two patients in the control group 
and two patients in the treated group). A significant VAS pain decrease was 
detected in patients treated with autologous fat grafting (3.1 point reduction, 
p ≤ 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Because of the safety, efficacy, and optimal tolerability of the 
procedure, we believe that fat grafting can be considered useful in treating 
PMPS in patients who have undergone BCS and radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Household measures of socioeconomic position may better account for 
the shared nature of material resources, lifestyle, and social position of 
cohabiting persons, but household measures of education are rarely used. We 
aimed to evaluate the association of combined educational attainment of married 
couples on mortality and life expectancy in Switzerland.
METHODS: The study included 3,496,163 ever-married persons aged ≥30 years. The 
2000 census was linked to mortality records through 2008. Mortality by combined 
educational attainment was assessed by gender-age-specific HRs, with 95% CIs 
from adjusted models, life expectancy was derived using abridged life tables.
RESULTS: Having a less educated partner was associated with increased mortality. 
For example, the HR comparing men aged 50-64 years with tertiary education 
married to women with tertiary education to men with compulsory education 
married to women with compulsory education was 2.05 (1.92-2.18). The estimated 
remaining life expectancy in tertiary educated men aged 30 years married to 
women with tertiary education was 4.6 years longer than in men with compulsory 
education married to women with compulsory education. The gradient based on 
individual education was less steep: the HR comparing men aged 50-64 years with 
tertiary education with men with compulsory education was 1.74 (1.67-1.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Using individual educational attainment of married persons is 
common in epidemiological research, but may underestimate the combined effect of 
education on mortality and life expectancy. These findings are relevant to 
epidemiologic studies examining socio-demographic characteristics or aiming to 
adjust results for these characteristics.

adult onset, short-term dietary restriction.

BACKGROUND: Chronic dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to have beneficial 
effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. These factors show rapid 
and robust improvements when rodents were crossed over from an ad libitum (AL) 
diet to DR in mid life. We aimed to determine whether the beneficial effects 
induced by short-term exposure to DR can be retained as a 'metabolic memory' 
when AL feeding is resumed (AL-DR-AL) and vice versa: whether the effects of 
long-term DR can be reversed by a period of AL feeding (DR-AL-DR). C57BL/6 male 
and female mice were used to examine sex differences (N = 10/sex/group). Mice 
were fed AL or DR from 3 until 15 months (baseline) and each dietary crossover 
lasted approximately 5 months.
RESULTS: In females, body and fat mass were proportional to the changes in 
feeding regime and plasma insulin and glucose tolerance were unaffected by the 
crossovers. However, in male mice, glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels 
were reversed within 6 to 12 weeks. When males returned to AL intake following 
5 months DR (AL-DR-AL), body mass was maintained below baseline, proportional to 
changes in fat mass. Glucose tolerance was also significantly better compared to 
baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Male mice retained a metabolic memory of 5 months of DR feeding in 
terms of reduced body mass and improved glucose tolerance. This implies that 
some of the beneficial effects induced by a period of DR in adult life may be 
beneficial, even when free feeding is resumed at least in males. However, under 
continuous DR, lifespan extension was more prominent in females than in males.

BACKGROUND: The longevity of an organism is influenced by both genetic and 
environmental factors. With respect to genetic factors, a significant effort is 
being made to identify pharmacological agents that extend life span by targeting 
pathways with a defined role in the aging process. On the environmental side, 
the molecular mechanisms responsible for the positive influence of interventions 
such as dietary restriction are being explored. The environment experienced by 
humans in modern societies already contains countless compounds that may 
influence longevity. Understanding the role played by common compounds that 
substantially affect the aging process will be critical for predicting and 
interpreting the outcome of introducing new interventions. Caffeine is the most 
widely used psychoactive drug worldwide. Prior studies in flies, worms, and mice 
indicate that caffeine may positively impact age-associated neurodegenerative 
pathology, such as that observed in Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Here we report that caffeine is capable of extending life span and 
improving healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans, a finding that is in agreement 
with a recently published screen looking for FDA-approved compounds capable of 
extending worm life span. Life span extension using caffeine displays epistatic 
interaction with two known longevity interventions: dietary restriction and 
reduced insulin signaling. Caffeine treatment also delays pathology in a 
nematode model of polyglutamine disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of caffeine as a relevant factor in aging and 
healthspan in worms, combined with prior work in both humans and rodents linking 
caffeine consumption to reduced risk of age-associated disease, suggests that 
caffeine may target conserved longevity pathways. Further, it may be important 
to consider caffeine consumption when developing clinical interventions, 
particularly those designed to mimic dietary restriction or modulate 
insulin/IGF-1-like signaling. The positive impact of caffeine on a worm model of 
polyglutamine disease suggests that chronic caffeine consumption may generally 
enhance resistance to proteotoxic stress and may be relevant to assessing risk 
and developing treatments for human diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's 
disease. Future work addressing the relevant targets of caffeine in models of 
aging and healthspan will help to clarify the underlying mechanisms and 
potentially identify new molecular targets for disease intervention.

Renal transplant recipients (RTR) have reduced peak aerobic capacity, muscle 
strength, arterial function and an unfavorable cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) 
profile. This study compared the effects of 12 weeks of supervised endurance and 
strength training (EST, n = 16) versus usual care (UC, n = 15) on peak aerobic 
capicity, cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function, CVD risk profile, and 
quality of life (QOL) in RTR (55 ± 13 years). Peak aerobic capacity and exercise 
hemodynamics, arterial compliance, 24-h blood pressure, muscle strength, lean 
body mass, CVD risk score, and QOL were assessed before and after 12 weeks. The 
change in peak aerobic capacity (EST: 2.6 ± 3.1 vs. UC: -0.5 ± 2.5 mL/(kg·min)), 
cardiac output (EST: 1.7 ± 2.6 vs. UC: -0.01 ± 0.8 L/min), leg press (EST: 48.7 
± 34.1 vs. UC: -10.5 ± 37.7 kg) and leg extension strength (EST: 9.5 ± 10.3 vs. 
UC: 0.65 ± 5.5 kg) improved significantly after EST compared with UC. The 
overall change in QOL improved significantly after 12 weeks of EST compared with 
UC. No significant difference was found between groups for lean body mass, 
arterial compliance, 24-h blood pressure or CVD risk score. Supervised EST is an 
effective intervention to improve peak exercise aerobic capacity and cardiac 
output, muscle strength and QOL in clinically stable RTR.

Water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (OligoCS) and nanowhisker 
chitosan (CSWK) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork 
model study. The high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral pH 
range (pH 5-8) of OligoCS and CSWK lead to an inhibition against Gram-positive 
(Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus) and 
Gram-negative microbes (Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7). In 
the minced pork model, OligoCS effectively performs a food preservative for 
shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, 
biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. OligoCS 
maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the 
electrophoresis. The present work points out that water-based chitosan with its 
unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but 
also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has 
the potential to be used as a food preservative.

Maintaining high transcriptional fidelity is essential for life. Some DNA 
lesions lead to significant changes in transcriptional fidelity. In this review, 
we will summarize recent progress towards understanding the molecular basis of 
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional fidelity and DNA lesion-induced 
transcriptional mutagenesis. In particular, we will focus on the three key 
checkpoint steps of controlling Pol II transcriptional fidelity: insertion 
(specific nucleotide selection and incorporation), extension (differentiation of 
RNA transcript extension of a matched over mismatched 3'-RNA terminus), and 
proofreading (preferential removal of misincorporated nucleotides from the 
3'-RNA end). We will also discuss some novel insights into the molecular basis 
and chemical perspectives of controlling Pol II transcriptional fidelity through 
structural, computational, and chemical biology approaches.

BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) 
together constitute the commonest gynaecological presentation in secondary care 
and impose substantial demands on health service resources. Accurate diagnosis 
is of key importance to realising effective treatment, reducing morbidity and, 
in the case of PMB, reducing mortality. There are many tests available, 
including transvaginal scan (TVS), endometrial biopsy (EBx), saline infusion 
sonography and outpatient hysteroscopy (OPH); however, optimal diagnostic 
work-up is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the most cost-effective diagnostic testing strategy for 
the diagnosis and treatment of (i) HMB and (ii) PMB.
DATA SOURCES: Parameter inputs were derived from systematic quantitative 
reviews, individual patient data (IPD) from existing data sets and focused 
searches for specific data. In the absence of data estimates, the consensus view 
of an expert clinical panel was obtained.
METHODS: Two clinically informed decision-analytic models were constructed to 
reflect current service provision for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting 
with HMB and PMB. The model-based economic evaluation took the form of a 
cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the NHS in a contemporary, 
'one-stop' secondary care clinical setting, where all indicated testing 
modalities would be available during a single visit.
RESULTS: Two potentially cost-effective testing strategies for the initial 
investigation of women with HMB were identified: OPH alone or in combination 
with EBx. Although a combination testing strategy of OPH + EBx was marginally 
more effective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
approximately £21,000 to gain one more satisfied patient, whereas for OPH it was 
just £360 when compared with treatment with the levonorgestrel intrauterine 
system (LNG-IUS) without investigation. Initial testing with OPH was the most 
cost-effective testing approach for women wishing to preserve fertility and for 
women with symptoms refractory to empirical treatment with a LNG-IUS. For the 
investigation of PMB, selective use of TVS based on historical risk prediction 
for the diagnostic work-up of women presenting with PMB generated an ICER 
compared with our reference strategy of 'no initial work-up' of £129,000 per 
extra woman surviving 5 years. The ICERs for the two other non-dominated testing 
strategies, combining history and TVS or combining OPH and TVS, were over £2M 
each.
LIMITATIONS: In the absence of IPD, estimates of accuracy for test combinations 
presented some uncertainty where test results were modelled as being discordant.
CONCLUSIONS: For initial investigation of women presenting to secondary care 
with HMB who do not require preservation of their fertility, our research 
suggests a choice between OPH alone or a combination of OPH and EBx. From our 
investigation, OPH appears to be the optimal first-line diagnostic test used for 
the investigation of women presenting to secondary care with HMB wishing to 
preserve their fertility or refractory to previous medical treatment with the 
LNG-IUS. We would suggest that the current recommendation of basing the initial 
investigation of women with PMB on the universal TVS measurement of endometrial 
thickness at a 5-mm threshold may need to be replaced by a strategy of 
restricting TVS to women with risk factors (e.g. increasing age-raised body mass 
index, diabetes or nulliparity), obtained from the preceding clinical 
assessment.

INTRODUCTION: Warfarin-treated patients with poor international normalized ratio 
(INR) control, measured with time in therapeutic range (TTR) or the standard 
deviation of transformed INR (SDTINR), have an increased risk for clinical 
events. To what extent only a short period with an altered INR control may 
influence outcomes remains unknown. This study assessed the impact of transient 
periods of worsened or improved INR control on life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) among warfarin-treated patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) using both metrics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Warfarin-treated patients with AF, registered in the 
patient record system Journalia during years 1985-2000, were included. 
Information on all-cause mortality was collected from the Cause of Death 
Register. Hypothetical scenarios where patients were assumed to have a 
transiently altered INR control during 30days were modeled statistically using 
hazard functions, and the impact on remaining life expectancy and QALYs was 
assessed.
RESULTS: When using SDTINR, a 70-year old man within the 20th best INR control 
percentile was estimated to lose 7.4days of life or 0.0100 QALYs from a 30-day 
long worsened INR control to that of an average 70-year old male patient. 
Correspondingly, 4.0days of life or 0.0059 QALYs would be gained if a 70-year 
old man within the 20th worst INR control percentile would have an average INR 
control during 30days. The magnitudes were smaller when TTR was used to 
determine INR control.
CONCLUSIONS: Even short periods of an altered INR control is expected to have 
impact on life expectancy and QALYs among patients with AF.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether longevity after mechanical aortic root 
replacement is influenced by the patient's gender.
METHODS: From February 1998 to June 2011, 476 patients (376 men, 100 women, mean 
age, 53±12 years; range, 18-88) underwent composite aortic root replacement. Of 
these patients, 398 (312 men) were included in the present analysis. The 
indications for root replacement were aortic valve dysfunction (mostly stenosis) 
and concomitant aneurysmal disease in 334 (83.9%), acute type A aortic 
dissection in 51 (12.8%), and infective endocarditis in 10 (2.5%). Other 
indications were technical or anatomic considerations (0.8%).
RESULTS: The women who presented for surgery were significantly older (men, 
52±12 years vs women, 56±12 years; P=.01). However, no significant differences 
were found with regard to previous cardiac surgery (5.3%, 20 men [6.4%] vs 1 
woman [1.2%]; P=.06), concomitant procedures (38%; 117 men [37.5%] vs 35 women 
[40.7%]; P=.62), or additive EuroSCORE (men, 5.1±2.2; women, 5.2±2.2; P=.55). 
The mean diameter of the ascending aorta was not significantly different between 
the 2 groups (men, 54±9 mm; women, 56±14 mm; P=.97). The median follow-up period 
was 7.4 years (range, 0-13; 2366 cumulative patient-years), with no significant 
difference in hospital mortality (men, 6.7% vs women, 10.5%; P=.25). Overall, 
men enjoyed significantly better longevity than did women. After 10 years, 
73%±3% of the men and only 60%±6% of the women were alive (P=.03). Although no 
long-term survival benefit for either gender was found in an age-matched 
subgroup among young patients (P=.66), men experienced much more favorable 
longevity after 55 years of age (P=.04). Consequently, the longevity in men-but 
not in women-was equal to an age-matched normal population.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term survival after mechanical aortic root 
replacement was significantly better among men. However, comparing age-matched 
subgroups≤55 years old, no significantly different life expectancy was found 
after mechanical root replacement.

Serological surveys provide reliable information from which to calculate forces 
(instantaneous rates) of infection, but waning immunity and clinical 
consequences that depend on residual immunity complicate interpretation of 
results. We devised a means of calculating these rates that accounts for 
passively acquired maternal antibodies that decay or active immunity that wanes, 
permitting re-infection. We applied our method to pertussis (whooping cough) in 
Sweden, where vaccination was discontinued from 1979 to 1995. A national 
cross-sectional serosurvey of antibodies to pertussis toxin, which peak soon 
after infection and then decay, was conducted shortly after vaccination resumed. 
Together with age-specific contact rates in Finland, contemporary forces of 
infection enable us to evaluate the recent assertion that the probability of 
infection upon contact is age-independent. We find elevated probabilities among 
children, adolescents and young adults, whose contacts may be more intimate than 
others. Products of contact rates and probabilities of infection permit 
transmission modeling and estimation of the intrinsic reproduction number. In 
contrast to another recent estimate, ours approximates the ratio of life 
expectancy and age at first infection. Our framework is sufficiently general to 
accommodate more realistic sojourn distributions and additional lifetime 
infections.

Life expectancy and longevity are influenced by air pollutants and socioeconomic 
status, but the extend and significance are still unclear. Better understanding 
how the spatial differences of life expectancy and longevity are affected by air 
pollutants is needed for generating public health and environmental strategies 
since the whole of China is now threatened by deteriorated air quality. 85 major 
city regions were chosen as research areas. Geographically Weighted Regression 
(GWR) and Stepwise Regression (SR) were used to find the spatial correlations 
between health indicators and air pollutants, adjusted by per capita GDP(1). The 
results were, regions with higher life expectancy were mainly located in the 
east area and areas with good air quality, a regional difference of 10 μg/m(3) 
in ambient air SO2(2) could cause adjusted 0.28 year's difference in life 
expectancy, a regional difference of 10 μg/m(3) in ambient air PM10(3) could 
lead to a longevity ratio difference of 2.23, and per capita GDP was positively 
associating with life expectancy but not longevity ratio, with a regional 
difference of 10,000 RMB(4) associating with adjusted 0.49 year's difference in 
life expectancy. This research also showed the evidences that there exist 
spatially differences for ambient air PM10 and SO2 influencing life expectancy 
and longevity in China, and this influences were clearer in south China.

BACKGROUND: Advancements in medical technology and increased life expectancy 
have been described as contributing to the evolution of endocarditis. We sought 
to determine whether there has been a change in the incidence, demographics, 
microbiology, complications, and outcomes of infective endocarditis over a 
10-year time span.
METHODS: We screened 28,420 transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram 
reports performed at the Gill Heart Institute for the following indications: 
fever, masses, emboli (including stroke), sepsis, bacteremia, and endocarditis 
in 2 time periods: 1999 to 2000 and 2009 to 2010. Data were collected from 
diagnosed endocarditis cases.
RESULTS: Overall, 143 cases of infective endocarditis were analyzed (48 in 
1999-2000 and 95 in 2009-2010). The endocarditis incidence per number of 
admissions remained nearly constant at 0.113% for 1999-2000 and 0.148% for 
2009-2010 (P = .153). However, tricuspid valve involvement increased markedly 
from 6% to 36% (P < .001). Also, reported history of intravenous drug use 
increased from 15% to 40% (P = .002). Valvular complications doubled from 17% to 
35% (P = .031). Septic pulmonary emboli increased from 10% to 25% (P = .047). 
Despite these noted differences, inpatient mortality remained unchanged at 25% 
and 28% (P = .696) for the 2 time periods, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endocarditis at the University of Kentucky Medical 
Center has not changed and mortality remains high, but the "face of 
endocarditis" in Kentucky has evolved with an increased incidence of tricuspid 
valve involvement, valvular complications, and embolic events.

PURPOSE: Radical prostatectomy is traditionally reserved for men with at least 
10-year life expectancy. Numerous studies show that survival estimates by 
physicians are inaccurate. We determined how well men undergoing radical 
prostatectomy for cancer are prognosticated by comparing observed and expected 
survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study using 
population based data sets to identify each man in Ontario, Canada between 1992 
and 2011 who was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent radical 
prostatectomy within 6 months. Observed 10-year survival rates were calculated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Two expected 10-year survival rates were 
calculated using 1) population life tables and 2) the ADG® score, an accurate, 
validated index that predicts mortality risk based on patient comorbidities.
RESULTS: A total of 36,045 men with a median age of 62 years were included in 
the study. Median observation time was 8.1 years. Observed 10-year survival was 
88.9% (95% CI 88.4-89.3), significantly greater than the expected 10-year 
survival of 83.3% according to life tables and 76.0% according to ADG 
score. The observed-to-expected death ratio was 0.66 (range 0.64-0.68) and 0.46 
(range 0.45-0.48) using life tables and the ADG score, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ontario men who undergo radical prostatectomy for cancer 
have 10-year survival that significantly exceeds that of the population and 
individuals with similar comorbidities. This indicates that physicians and 
patients involved in deciding who should undergo radical prostatectomy have done 
an excellent job at identifying patients with prostate cancer with high 
survival. We are uncertain how these results apply to patients and physicians 
outside Ontario.

Paulo, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: In Brazil, one-fifth of the population reports not doing any 
physical activity. This study aimed to assess the impact of physical inactivity 
on major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), all-cause mortality and life 
expectancy in Brazil, by region and sociodemographic profile.
METHODS: We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for physical 
inactivity associated with coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast 
cancer, colon cancer, and all-cause mortality. To calculate the PAF, we used the 
physical inactivity prevalence from the 2008 Brazilian Household Survey and 
relative risk data in the literature.
RESULTS: In Brazil, physical inactivity is attributable to 3% to 5% of all major 
NCDs and 5.31% of all-cause mortality, ranging from 5.82% in the southeastern 
region to 2.83% in the southern region. Eliminating physical inactivity would 
increase the life expectancy by an average of 0.31 years. This reduction would 
affect mainly individuals with ≥ 15 years of schooling, male, Asian, elderly, 
residing in an urban area and earning ≥ 2 times the national minimum wage.
CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, physical inactivity has a major impact on NCDs and 
mortality, principally in the southeastern and central-west regions. Public 
policies and interventions promoting physical activity will significantly 
improve the health of the population.
