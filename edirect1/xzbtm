Northwest. By extension, our results therefore suggest that dietary glyphosate 
exposure is not a health concern for breastfed infants. This study was 
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02670278.

BACKGROUND: The inverse association between education and mortality has grown 
stronger the last decades in many countries. During the same period, gains in 
life expectancy have been concentrated to older ages; still, old-age mortality 
is seldom the focus of attention when analyzing trends in the 
education-mortality gradient. It is further unknown if increased educational 
inequalities in mortality are preceded by increased inequalities in morbidity of 
which hospitalization may be a proxy.
METHODS: Using administrative population registers from 1971 and onwards, 
education-specific annual changes in the risk of death and hospital admission 
were estimated with complimentary log-log models. These risk changes were 
supplemented by estimations of the ages at which 25, 50, and 75% of the 
population had been hospitalized or died (after age 60).
RESULTS: The mortality decline among older people increasingly benefitted the 
well-educated over the less well-educated. This inequality increase was larger 
for the younger old, and among men. Educational inequalities in the age of a 
first hospital admission generally followed the development of growing gaps, but 
at a slower pace than mortality and inequalities did not increase among the 
oldest individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Education continues to be a significant predictor of health and 
longevity into old age. That the increase in educational inequalities is greater 
for mortality than for hospital admissions (our proxy of overall morbidity) may 
reflect that well-educated individuals gradually have obtained more 
possibilities or resources to survive a disease than less well-educated 
individuals have the last four decades.

INTRODUCTION: Economic disadvantage may adversely influence the outcomes of 
infants with gastroschisis (GS). Gastroschisis International (GiT) is a network 
of seven paediatric surgical centres, spanning two continents, evaluating GS 
treatment and outcomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 2-year retrospective review of GS infants at GiT 
centres. Primary outcome was mortality. Sites were classified into high, middle 
and low income country (HIC, MIC, and LIC). MIC and LIC were sometimes combined 
for analysis (LMIC). Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated and 
centres with the highest mortality underwent a needs assessment.
RESULTS: Mortality was higher in the LICs and LMICs: 100% in Uganda and Cote 
d'Ivoire, 75% in Nigeria and 60% in Malawi. 29% and 0% mortality was reported in 
South Africa and the UK, respectively. Septicaemia was the commonest cause of 
death. Averted and non-avertable DALYs were nil in Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire (no 
survivors). In the UK (100% survival) averted DALYs (met need) was highest, 
representing death and disability prevented by surgical intervention. 
Performance improvement measures were agreed: a prospectively maintained GS 
register; clarification of the key team members of a GS team and management 
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose the use of GS as a bellwether condition for assessing 
institutional capacity to deliver newborn surgical care. Early access to care, 
efficient multidisciplinary team working, appropriate resuscitation, avoidance 
of abdominal compartment syndrome, stabilization prior to formal closure and 
proactive nutritional interventions may reduce GS-associated burden of disease 
in low resource settings.

INTRODUCTION: Trisomy 21 (T21) is the most common chromosomal abnormality and 
one of the main causes of intellectual disability. The tumor profile of T21 
patients is characterized by the low frequency of solid tumors including breast 
cancer.
METHODS: The objective of this work was to analyze the literature to find 
possible clues for the low frequency of breast cancer in T21 persons with a 
focus on one hand to the various risks and protective factors against breast 
cancer for women T21, and on the other hand to changes in the expression of 
different genes located on chromosome 21.
RESULTS: T21 women have hormonal and societal risk factors for breast cancer: 
frequent nulliparity, lack of breastfeeding, physical inactivity and high body 
mass index. The age of menopause, earlier in T21 women, has a modest protective 
effect against breast cancer. The low rate of breast tumors in T21 women is 
probably mainly linked to the reduced life expectancy compared to the general 
population (risk of death before the age of onset of the majority of breast 
cancers) and the presence of a third chromosome 21, characterizing the disease. 
It might lead to the increased expression of a number of genes contributing 
directly or undirectly to tumor suppression, decreased tumor angiogenesis and 
increased cell apoptosis. Moreover, changes in the mammary stroma of persons T21 
could have an inhibitory role on the development of breast tumors.
CONCLUSION: The low frequency of breast cancers for T21 patients may not only be 
explained by hormonal and societal factors, but also by genetic mechanisms which 
could constitute an interesting axis of research in breast cancer.

Schizophrenia is associated with decreased life expectancy (15-25 y) compared to 
the general population, with comorbid somatic diseases and in particular 
cardiovascular diseases being a major cause. Life style and medication probably 
account for much of the increased mortality risk due to somatic diseases in 
schizophrenia, but the evidence implicating biological pathways potentially 
affecting both body and brain is increasing. This includes overlapping genes 
between schizophrenia and somatic diseases, prenatal risk factors such as 
hypoxia and infections, and increased cardiovascular disease risk in drug-naïve 
patients at illness onset. Although environmental bias increases throughout the 
disease course, there are also some studies on chronic schizophrenia and 
postmortem brain samples that warrant further attention. In the following, we 
will attempt to move beyond environmental impact and explore some of the shared 
pathophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying both schizophrenia and 
somatic diseases.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
gemcitabine plus modern radiotherapy versus gemcitabine alone in the treatment 
of locally advanced pancreatic cancer in Taiwan.
METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was performed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of 3 treatment regimens; gemcitabine alone (gem-alone), 
gemcitabine plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (gem-IMRT), and gemcitabine 
plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (gem-SBRT). Patients transitioned between 5 
health states: stable disease, local progression, distant metastasis, local and 
distant metastasis, and death.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for gem-IMRT and gem-SBRT 
compared with gem-alone were NT$27,120,168 and NT$2,145,683 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained, respectively. A willingness to pay threshold of 3 times the 
per capita gross domestic product was adopted according to the definition of the 
World Health Organization. The Taiwan per capita gross domestic product in 2015 
was NT$673,920 (US$22,464; 1 NT$ = US$0.03333 in Taiwan); thus, a threshold was 
considered as NT$2,021,760 (US$67,392). The Monte-Carlo simulation found that 
the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay threshold of 
NT$2,021,760 per quality-adjusted life-year was 0% chance for gem-IMRT and 50% 
for gem-SBRT.
IMPLICATIONS: This study indicated that gem-IMRT or gem-SBRT in locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer is not cost-effective at a willingness to pay as defined by 
World Health Organization guideline in Taiwan.

Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for the treatment 
of anogenital warts: systematic review and economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Typically occurring on the external genitalia, anogenital warts 
(AGWs) are benign epithelial skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus 
infection. AGWs are usually painless but can be unsightly and physically 
uncomfortable, and affected people might experience psychological distress. The 
evidence base on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments 
for AGWs is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence on the clinical effectiveness 
of medical and surgical treatments for AGWs and to develop an economic model to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of the treatments.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other 
Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library databases and Web of 
Science) were searched from inception (or January 2000 for Web of Science) to 
September 2014. Bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews were hand-searched 
to identify potentially relevant studies. The World Health Organization 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov were 
searched for ongoing and planned studies.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature was 
carried out according to standard methods and a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) 
undertaken. The model implemented for each outcome was that with the lowest 
deviance information criterion. A de novo economic model was developed to assess 
cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the UK NHS. The model structure was 
informed through a systematic review of the economic literature and in 
consultation with clinical experts. Effectiveness data were obtained from the 
MTC. Costs were obtained from the literature and standard UK sources.
RESULTS: Of 4232 titles and abstracts screened for inclusion in the review of 
clinical effectiveness, 60 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 19 
interventions were included. Analysis by MTC indicated that ablative techniques 
were typically more effective than topical interventions at completely clearing 
AGWs at the end of treatment. Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution (Condyline(®), 
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Warticon(®) solution, Stiefel Laboratories 
Ltd) was found to be the most effective topical treatment evaluated. Networks 
for other outcomes included fewer treatments, which restrict conclusions on the 
comparative effectiveness of interventions. In total, 84 treatment strategies 
were assessed using the economic model. Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution first line 
followed by carbon dioxide (CO2) laser therapy second line if AGWs did not clear 
was most likely to be considered a cost-effective use of resources at a 
willingness to pay of £20,000-30,000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. The result was robust to most sensitivity analyses conducted.
LIMITATIONS: Limited reporting in identified studies of baseline characteristics 
for the enrolled population generates uncertainty around the comparability of 
the study populations and therefore the generalisability of the results to 
clinical practice. Subgroup analyses were planned based on type, number and size 
of AGWs, all of which are factors thought to influence treatment effect. Lack of 
data on clinical effectiveness based on these characteristics precluded analysis 
of the differential effects of treatments in the subgroups of interest. Despite 
identification of 60 studies, most comparisons in the MTC are informed by only 
one RCT. Additionally, lack of head-to-head RCTs comparing key treatments, 
together with minimal reporting of results in some studies, precluded 
comprehensive analysis of all treatments for AGWs.
CONCLUSIONS: The results generated by the MTC are in agreement with consensus 
opinion that ablative techniques are clinically more effective at completely 
clearing AGWs after treatment. However, the evidence base informing the MTC is 
limited. A head-to-head RCT that evaluates the comparative effectiveness of 
interventions used in clinical practice would help to discern the potential 
advantages and disadvantages of the individual treatments. The results of the 
economic analysis suggest that podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution is likely to 
represent a cost-effective first-line treatment option. More expensive effective 
treatments, such as CO2 laser therapy or surgery, may represent cost-effective 
second-line treatment options. No treatment and podophyllin are unlikely to be 
considered cost-effective treatment options. There is uncertainty around the 
cost-effectiveness of treatment with imiquimod, trichloroacetic acid and 
cryotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been proposed as a method to 
estimate utility weights for health states within utility instruments. However, 
the most appropriate method to anchor the utility values on the full health to 
dead quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scale remains uncertain. We test four 
approaches to anchoring in which dead is valued at zero and full health at one.
METHODS: We use data from two DCEs valuing EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L health states, 
which presented pairs of health profiles with an associated duration, and a dead 
option. The approaches to anchoring the results on the required scale were (1) 
using only preferences between non-dead health profiles; (2) including the dead 
data, treating it as a health profile with zero duration; (3) explicitly 
modelling both duration and dead; and (4) using the preferences regarding the 
dead health state as an external anchor subsequent to the estimation of approach 
1.
RESULTS: All approaches lead to differences in the scale of utility decrements, 
but not the ranking of EQ-5D health states. The models differ in their ability 
to predict preferences around dead health states, and the characteristics of the 
value sets in terms of their range and the proportion of states valued as worse 
than dead.
DISCUSSION: Appropriate anchoring of DCEs with or without complementary time 
trade-off (TTO) data remains unresolved, and the method chosen will impact on 
health resource allocation decision making employing the value sets.

Temperature is the environmental factor that systematically changes for decades 
and, as in plants and animals, can significantly affect the growth and 
development of fungi, including the abundance of their sporulation. During the 
time of study (2010-2012), a rapid increase in air temperature was observed in 
Poland, which coincided with the substantial decrease in rainfall. The increase 
in annual mean temperatures at three monitoring sites of this study was 0.9 °C 
in Lublin and Rzeszow (east Poland) and 2.0 °C in Poznan (west Poland). Such 
warming of air masses was comparable to the average global air temperature rise 
in the period of 1880-2012 accounting for 0.85 °C, as reported by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Moreover, there was a substantial 
decrease in rainfall, ranging from 32.7 % (Poznan) to 43.0 % (Rzeszow). We have 
demonstrated that under such conditions the mean and median values of total 
Cladosporium spore counts significantly increased and the spore seasons were 
greatly accelerated. Moreover, earlier start and later end of the season caused 
its extension, lasting from over 20 days in Rzeszow to around 60 days in Lublin 
and Poznan, when the cumulative amount of 5-95 % of spores was considered. The 
time of reaching the cumulative amount of 50 % of spores was up to 25 days 
earlier (difference in Poznan between 2010 and 2012). There was also a striking 
acceleration of the date of the maximal Cladosporium spore concentration per 
cubic metre of air (26 days for Lublin, 43 for Poznan and 56 for Rzeszow).

Patient and caregiver awareness of pancreatic cancer treatments and clinical 
trials.

Cancer Action Network, Washington, DC, USA ; 3 Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer has been well established. 
For many patients, active treatments can improve patient outcomes, such as 
overall survival and symptom control. Nevertheless, there is evidence that 
pancreatic cancer is undertreated, even in patients with resectable disease. In 
addition, although participation in a clinical trial is recommended by current 
pancreatic cancer treatment guidelines, recent data suggest that patient 
participation in ongoing trials is below overall target accrual.
METHODS: A survey was prepared and distributed to patients with pancreatic 
cancer and caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer by the Pancreatic 
Cancer Action Network (funding for the survey was provided by Celgene 
Corporation). The 70-question survey was completed between July 30, 2013, and 
September 18, 2013, by respondents in the United States. The goal of this 
analysis was to evaluate patient and caregiver interactions with physicians 
about pancreatic cancer treatments and participation in clinical trials.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 184 patients and 213 caregivers (not 
necessarily paired). Quality of life, extension of survival, and symptom 
management were identified as the most important concerns among both patients 
and caregivers. A large majority of respondents (94.9%) reported that the 
patient followed the physician's treatment recommendation. Approximately 30% of 
respondents indicated that the diagnosing physician offered treatment options at 
the time of diagnosis. Among the respondents who indicated that the physician 
did not offer treatment options at diagnosis, 20.4% stated that no doctor had 
ever spoken to them about treatment options. Most respondents (83.1%) reported 
that the patient received chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Approximately half 
of respondents (49.1%) indicated that they had never discussed clinical trials 
with a physician. Twelve percent of respondents reported that the patient 
participated in a clinical trial. In those cases, physicians were listed as the 
primary source of trial information 80.4% of the time. Familiarity with Patient 
Central (known as "Patient and Liaison Services" at the time of the study), a 
support service offered by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, was associated 
with higher rates of receiving treatment (P<0.05), searching the Internet for 
information on clinical trials (P<0.05), and participating in clinical trials 
(not statistically significant).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that large numbers of patients 
and caregivers had never had discussions with physicians about pancreatic cancer 
treatments or clinical trials. The point about trials takes on even greater 
importance, considering that patients who participate in clinical trials report 
better outcomes than those receiving the same treatment outside of clinical 
trials. Increased discussions with patients could potentially increase treatment 
and trial participation, possibly improving patient- and caregiver-stated 
priorities of quality of life, extension of survival, and symptom management.

Antidiabetic treatments aiming to reduce body weight are currently gaining 
increased interest. Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor 
agonist administered twice daily via s.c. injection, improves glycemic control, 
often with associated weight reduction. To further improve the therapeutic 
efficacy of exendin-4, we have developed a novel peptide engineering strategy 
that incorporates a serum protein binding motif onto a covalent side-chain 
staple and applied to the peptide to enhance its helicity and, as a consequence, 
its potency and serum half-life. We demonstrated that one of the resulting 
peptides, E6, has significantly improved half-life and glucose tolerance in an 
oral glucose tolerance test in rodents. Chronic treatment of E6 significantly 
decreased body weight and fasting blood glucose, improved lipid metabolism, and 
also reduced hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice. Moreover, the high 
potency of E6 allowed us to administer this peptide using a dissolvable 
microstructure-based transdermal delivery system. Pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic studies in guinea pigs showed that a single 5-min application of 
a microstructure system containing E6 significantly improved glucose tolerance 
for 96 h. This delivery strategy may offer an effective and patient-friendly 
alternative to currently marketed GLP-1 injectables and can likely be extended 
to other peptide hormones.

Health conditions change from year to year, with a general tendency in many 
countries for improvement. These conditions also change from one birth cohort to 
another: some generations suffer more adverse events in childhood, smoke more 
heavily, eat poorer diets, etc., than generations born earlier or later. Because 
it is difficult to disentangle period effects from cohort effects, demographers, 
epidemiologists, actuaries, and other population scientists often disagree about 
cohort effects' relative importance. In particular, some advocate forecasts of 
life expectancy based on period trends; others favor forecasts that hinge on 
cohort differences. We use a combination of age decomposition and exchange of 
survival probabilities between countries to study the remarkable recent history 
of female life expectancy in Denmark, a saga of rising, stagnating, and now 
again rising lifespans. The gap between female life expectancy in Denmark vs. 
Sweden grew to 3.5 y in the period 1975-2000. When we assumed that Danish women 
born 1915-1945 had the same survival probabilities as Swedish women, the gap 
remained small and roughly constant. Hence, the lower Danish life expectancy is 
caused by these cohorts and is not attributable to period effects.

Safe and complete resection represents the first step in the treatment of 
glioblastomas and is mandatory in increasing the effectiveness of adjuvant 
therapy to prolong overall survival. With gross total resection currently 
limited in extent to MRI contrast enhancing areas, the extent to which 
supra-complete resection beyond obvious contrast enhancement could have impact 
on overall survival remains unclear. DiVA (dual intraoperative visualization 
approach) redefines gross total resection as currently accepted by enabling for 
the first time supra-complete surgery without compromising patient safety. This 
approach exploits the advantages of two already accepted surgical techniques 
combining intraoperative MRI with integrated functional neuronavigation and 
5-ALA by integrating them into a single surgical approach. We investigated 
whether this technique has impact on overall outcome in GBM patients. 105 
patients with GBM were included. We achieved complete resection with 
intraoperative MRI alone according to current best-practice in glioma surgery in 
75 patients. 30 patients received surgery with supra-complete resection. The 
control arm showed a median life expectancy of 14 months, reflecting current 
standards-of-care and outcome. In contrast, patients receiving supra-complete 
surgery displayed significant increase in median survival time to 18.5 months 
with overall survival time correlating directly with extent of supra-complete 
resection. This extension of overall survival did not come at the cost of 
neurological deterioration. We show for the first time that supra-complete 
glioma surgery leads to significant prolongation of overall survival time in GBM 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Although a number of studies on infectious disease trends in China 
exist, these studies have not distinguished the age, period, and cohort effects 
simultaneously. Here, we analyze infectious disease mortality trends among urban 
and rural residents in China and distinguish the age, period, and cohort effects 
simultaneously.
METHODS: Infectious disease mortality rates (1990-2010) of urban and rural 
residents (5-84 years old) were obtained from the China Health Statistical 
Yearbook and analyzed with an age-period-cohort (APC) model based on Intrinsic 
Estimator (IE).
RESULTS: Infectious disease mortality is relatively high at age group 5-9, 
reaches a minimum in adolescence (age group 10-19), then rises with age, with 
the growth rate gradually slowing down from approximately age 75. From 1990 to 
2010, except for a slight rise among urban residents from 2000 to 2005, the 
mortality of Chinese residents experienced a substantial decline, though at a 
slower pace from 2005 to 2010. In contrast to the urban residents, rural 
residents experienced a rapid decline in mortality during 2000 to 2005. The 
mortality gap between urban and rural residents substantially narrowed during 
this period. Overall, later birth cohorts experienced lower infectious disease 
mortality risk. From the 1906-1910 to the 1941-1945 birth cohorts, the decrease 
of mortality among urban residents was significantly faster than that of 
subsequent birth cohorts and rural counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: With the rapid aging of the Chinese population, the prevention and 
control of infectious disease in elderly people will present greater challenges. 
From 1990 to 2010, the infectious disease mortality of Chinese residents and the 
urban-rural disparity have experienced substantial declines. However, the 
re-emergence of previously prevalent diseases and the emergence of new 
infectious diseases created new challenges. It is necessary to further 
strengthen screening, immunization, and treatment for the elderly and for older 
cohorts at high risk.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of glial high grade tumors (glioblastoma, anaplastic 
astrocytoma) and cerebral aneurysms is common but the association with optic 
glioma is rare. The treatment of these associated lesions is problematic.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old white woman presented to our institution with 
recurrent attacks of headache. Her preoperative radiological studies revealed a 
lesion of her left optic nerve with extension to the optic chiasma, an 
aneurysmatic dilatation of the left carotid bifurcation, a second aneurysm on 
the left of her middle cerebral artery, and a third one on her right anterior 
cerebral artery in the A2 tract. A left pterional approach was used to remove 
the tumor and clip the three aneurysmatic dilatations in a single stage.
CONCLUSIONS: We report this unusual case of optic glioma associated to multiples 
aneurysms and review the pertinent literature. An adequate knowledge of this 
association is mandatory to plan the correct approach to avoid complications.

Personalized medicine is a new field based on molecular biology and genomics in 
which targeted tumor therapies are administered to patients. Psycho-oncology is 
a complementary approach that considers social and psychological aspects of 
patients as part of the treatments for cancer patients. The aim of this 
mini-review is to weigh clinical benefits for breast cancer patients of both 
treatments and possibly enhance benefits by modulating the use of both 
interventions. We have compared and evaluated on the one hand the use of anti 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and, on the other hand, psycho-oncological 
interventions in metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer patients.Both 
treatments did not increase survival of metastatic breast cancer patients, while 
in a selected study psycho-oncological interventions extended lifespan of 
non-metastatic breast cancer patients and ameliorate psychological and social 
factors of metastatic breast cancer patients. Because the two approaches address 
completely different aspects of cancer patients, if the comparison is limited to 
the extension of survival, the value of these two treatments cannot be assessed 
and compared.It is likely that by comparing patients reported outcomes, possibly 
by using standardized Quality of Life questionnaires, both patients and health 
care providers can weigh the benefits of the two treatments. It is therefore 
important to evaluate the use of cancer patients' quality of life measures as a 
mean to improve their experiences about life and treatment, and possibly to 
extend their survival.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundant in various proteomes, 
where they play numerous important roles and complement biological activities of 
ordered proteins. Among functions assigned to IDPs are interactions with nucleic 
acids. However, often, such assignments are made based on the 
guilty-by-association principle. The validity of the extension of these 
correlations to all nucleic acid binding proteins has never been analyzed on a 
large scale across all domains of life. To fill this gap, we perform a 
comprehensive computational analysis of the abundance of intrinsic disorder and 
intrinsically disordered domains in nucleiomes (∼548 000 nucleic acid binding 
proteins) of 1121 species from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Nucleiome is a 
whole complement of proteins involved in interactions with nucleic acids. We 
show that relative to other proteins in the corresponding proteomes, the 
DNA-binding proteins have significantly increased disorder content and are 
significantly enriched in disordered domains in Eukaryotes but not in Archaea 
and Bacteria. The RNA-binding proteins are significantly enriched in the 
disordered domains in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, while the overall 
abundance of disorder in these proteins is significantly increased in Bacteria, 
Archaea, animals and fungi. The high abundance of disorder in nucleiomes 
supports the notion that the nucleic acid binding proteins often require 
intrinsic disorder for their functions and regulation.

health technology assessment.

University, Lancaster, LA1 4DJ, U.K.

The incremental life expectancy, defined as the difference in mean survival 
times between two treatment groups, is a crucial quantity of interest in 
cost-effectiveness analyses. Usually, this quantity is very difficult to 
estimate from censored survival data with a limited follow-up period. The paper 
develops estimation procedures for a time-shift survival model that, provided 
model assumptions are met, gives a reliable estimate of incremental life 
expectancy without extrapolation beyond the study period. Methods for inference 
are developed both for individual patient data and when only published 
Kaplan-Meier curves are available. Through simulation, the estimators are shown 
to be close to unbiased and constructed confidence intervals are shown to have 
close to nominal coverage for small to moderate sample sizes. Copyright © 2016

Lansing.

OBJECTIVES: Very little is known about socioeconomic differentials in mortality 
among persons surviving to old age in sub-Saharan Africa. We report on the 
impact of low socioeconomic position (SEP) on mortality over a 5-year 
observation period among community-dwelling older adults living in southwestern 
Nigeria.
METHOD: Data are from a household multistage probability sample of 2,149 Yoruba 
Nigerians aged 65 years or older. We collected information on indices related to 
health and well-being at baseline (2003/2004). Socioeconomic positions were 
estimated using asset-based measures relevant to low income settings. 
Information on mortality was obtained by research supervisors in multiple waves 
(2007, 2008, and 2009). Associations between baseline covariates and mortality 
were explored using discrete time survival models and life tables.
RESULTS: We recorded 357 deaths over 5 years, or an annual mortality rate of 
4.7% (95% CI = 4.2-5.2). Being 80 years or older (HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5) 
and belonging to the lowest SEP (HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) were the main 
predictors of mortality. The significant effect of lowest SEP on mortality risk 
over the study period was independent of age, gender, education, rural or urban 
residence, weight, physical activity level, and social engagement.
CONCLUSION: In this sample of older persons living in an economically 
disadvantaged context, we found persistent socioeconomic differentials in 
mortality estimated, conservatively, over 5 years.

PURPOSE: These are the final results of the prospective, multicenter, long-term 
(3.5-year) study of the efficacy/safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for overactive 
bladder syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who completed either of 2, 24-week phase 3 
trials could enter a 3-year extension and continue treatment with 
onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U as needed to control overactive bladder symptoms. Data 
were analyzed by the treatment(s) received (up to 6) and in discrete subgroups 
that received 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 treatments (to evaluate the consistency of the 
response after repeat treatments in the same patient groups). Assessments 
included the change from baseline in the number of urinary incontinence episodes 
per day and the proportion of patients who reported improvement/great 
improvement in urinary symptoms on the TBS (Treatment Benefit Scale) at week 12 
as co-primary end points. Other end points were the change from baseline in 
I-QOL (Incontinence Quality of Life), the number of urgency and micturition 
episodes per day; duration of effect; the number of adverse events; and the 
initiation of intermittent catheterization.
RESULTS: Consistent mean reductions in urinary incontinence were observed 
following continued onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, ranging from -3.1 to -3.8 in 
the overall population and -2.9 to -4.5 in the discrete subgroups. Durable 
improvements were seen in overactive bladder symptoms and quality of life. A 
high proportion of patients rated their condition as improved/greatly improved. 
The median duration of effect was 7.6 months. The most common adverse event was 
urinary tract infection. The rate of de novo catheterization after the first 
treatment was 4.0% and it ranged from 0.6% to 1.7% after subsequent treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term onabotulinumtoxinA treatment consistently decreased 
overactive bladder symptoms and improved quality of life with no new safety 
signals.
