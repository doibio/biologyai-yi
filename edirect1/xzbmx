and systematic approach to improve preventive care processes for the elderly has 
been called for. The County Council of Jönköping developed a national Web-based 
quality registry, Senior Alert, with a focus on the following areas: falls, 
pressure ulcers, malnutrition, and oral health. The patients are evaluated using 
validated risk assessment instruments, and the care is planned, executed, 
evaluated. The registry supports the users to work with preventive care 
systematically and in a standardized way and provides feedback to the care 
providers on their preventive care processes. The registry helps the caregivers 
fulfill the preventive care according to the best available clinical knowledge 
and practice. The registry also provides the government and health care 
politicians with data for setting aims for elderly care. The registry is used in 
90% of the municipalities and county councils throughout the country. The total 
number of risk assessments completed from 2009 to 2014 exceeded 1 000 000.

The lifespan of patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) continues to increase, 
and most affected individuals in high-resource countries now live into 
adulthood. This necessitates a successful transition from pediatric to adult 
health care. Care for transitioning patients with SCD often falls to primary 
care providers who may not be fully aware of the many challenges and issues 
faced by patients and the current management strategies for SCD. In this review, 
we aim to close the knowledge gap between primary care providers and specialists 
who treat transitioning patients with SCD. We describe the challenges and issues 
encountered by these patients, and we propose a biopsychosocial 
multidisciplinary approach to the management of the identified issues. Examples 
of this approach, such as transition-focused integrated care models and quality 
improvement collaboratives, with the potential to improve health outcomes in 
adulthood are also described.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify polyneuropathy impairments and comorbidities utilizing 
the Rochester Epidemiology Project (2010 census = 148,201).
METHODS: ICD-9-CM coding identified polyneuropathy cases (2006-2010) and their 
5:1 age- and sex-matched controls. Mortality and impairments were evaluated 
while identifying and adjusting for Charlson Index comorbidities.
RESULTS: Overall prevalence of polyneuropathy was 1.66%, and markedly rose to 
6.6% in persons older than 60 years. Cases (n = 2,892) had more comorbidities 
than controls (n = 14,435) with higher median Charlson Index (6 vs 3, p < 
0.001). Diabetes with end-organ disease represented the largest increased 
comorbidity in cases compared with controls (46.8% vs 6.5%). Diabetic 
polyneuropathy was the most common specific subtype (38.2%). Miscoded idiopathic 
cases and false-negative controls also commonly had diabetic polyneuropathy. 
Median modified Rankin Scale score was considerably higher for cases than 
controls (4 vs 1, p < 0.001). Multiple comorbidities were found associated with 
polyneuropathy after adjusting for diabetes co-occurrence, including pulmonary 
disease, dementia, and others. Polyneuropathy was an independent contributor to 
multiple functional impairments including difficulty walking (odds ratio [OR] = 
1.9), climbing stairs (OR = 2.0), using an assistive device (OR = 2.0), fall 
tendency (OR = 2.4), work disability (OR = 4.2), lower limb amputations (OR = 
3.9), and opioid use (OR = 2.7). Prevalent cases had a younger median age at 
death than controls (80 vs 86 years, p < 0.001), and incident cases had a 
6-month shorter survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Polyneuropathies have notable neurologic impairments beyond their 
identified multiple comorbidities. Life expectancy is shortened. Diabetic 
polyneuropathy is underidentified. The quantified extent of the disease burden 
and refined comorbidity associations emphasize that greater research efforts and 
health care initiatives are needed.

Cost-effectiveness of heat and moisture exchangers compared to usual care for 
pulmonary rehabilitation after total laryngectomy in Poland.

The beneficial physical and psychosocial effects of heat and moisture exchangers 
(HMEs) for pulmonary rehabilitation of laryngectomy patients are well evidenced. 
However, cost-effectiveness in terms of costs per additional quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) has not yet been investigated. Therefore, a model-based 
cost-effectiveness analysis of using HMEs versus usual care (UC) (including 
stoma covers, suction system and/or external humidifier) for patients after 
laryngectomy was performed. Primary outcomes were costs, QALYs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Secondary outcomes were pulmonary infections, 
and sleeping problems. The analysis was performed from a health care perspective 
of Poland, using a time horizon of 10 years and cycle length of 1 year. 
Transition probabilities were derived from various sources, amongst others a 
Polish randomized clinical trial. Quality of life data was derived from an 
Italian study on similar patients. Data on frequencies and mortality-related 
tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonia were derived from a Europe-wide survey 
amongst head and neck cancer experts. Substantial differences in 
quality-adjusted survival between the use of HMEs (3.63 QALYs) versus UC (2.95 
QALYs) were observed. Total health care costs/patient were 39,553 PLN (9465 
Euro) for the HME strategy and 4889 PLN (1168 Euro) for the UC strategy. HME use 
resulted in fewer pulmonary infections, and less sleeping problems. We could 
conclude that given the Polish threshold of 99,000 PLN/QALY, using HMEs is 
cost-effective compared to UC, resulting in 51,326 PLN/QALY (12,264 Euro/QALY) 
gained for patients after total laryngectomy. For the hospital period alone (2 
weeks), HMEs were cost-saving: less costly and more effective.

Endothelial cells regulate cardiac myocyte reorganisation through β1-integrin 
signalling.

BACKGROUND: In normal hearts, capillaries are densely distributed throughout the 
myocardial tissue, and the cross-talk between myocytes and capillary endothelial 
cells plays a pivotal role in regulating cardiac development, maturation and 
function. Although previous studies have suggested a role for the endothelium in 
the organisation of nearby cardiomyocytes, the underlying mechanism has yet to 
be illustrated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a transwell coculture system, we studied the 
paracrine effect of endothelial cells on cardiomyocytes and found that the 
regulation of cardiomyocyte spatial reorganisation and cytoskeletal dynamics by 
endothelial cells was coupled with β1-integrin induction. To determine the role 
of β1-integrin in this process, we preincubated myocytes with a β1-integrin 
function-blocking antibody before coculture. β1-integrin blockage abolished 
myocyte chemotactic activity and inhibited microtubule extension and stress 
fibre assembly. We further evaluated the therapeutic potential of combined 
endothelial cell-cardiac myocyte transplantation against ischemic cardiomyopathy 
in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mouse model. The results showed that 
myocytes and endothelial cells synergistically promoted ischemic myocardial 
repair, as evidenced by the robust engraftment and migration of implanted cells 
within the infarcted area, as well as the stimulation of angiogenesis, the 
attenuation of scar tissue and the improvement of cardiac function.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the necessity of β1-integrin in the 
interactions between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and presented a novel 
combined transplantation approach that might hold promise for treating ischemic 
cardiomyopathy.

Investigating the fall-injury reducing effect of impact absorbing flooring among 
female nursing home residents: initial results.

BACKGROUND: Fall-related injuries affect the lives of elderly to a substantial 
degree. This quasi-experimental study investigates the fall-injury reducing 
effect of impact absorbing flooring among female nursing home residents.
METHODS: The intervention site is a nursing home in Sweden where impact 
absorbing flooring was installed in parts of one of six wards (six out of 10 
apartments (excluding bathrooms), the communal dining-room and parts of the 
corridor). The impact absorbing flooring is a 12 mm thick closed cell flexible 
polyurethane/polyurea composite tile (500×500 mm) with an exterior surface of 
polyurethane/polyurea. A generalised linear model (log-binomial) was used to 
calculate the RR of injury from falls on impact absorbing flooring compared to 
falls on regular flooring, adjusted for age, body mass index, visual and 
cognitive impairments.
RESULTS: During the study period (1 October 2011 to 31 March 2014), 254 falls 
occurred on regular flooring and 77 falls on impact absorbing flooring. The 
injury/fall rate was 30.3% for falls on regular flooring and 16.9% for falls on 
impact absorbing flooring. Adjusted for covariates, the impact absorbing 
flooring significantly reduced the RR of injury in the event of a fall by 59% 
(RR 0.41 (95% Cl 0.20 to 0.80)).
CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first study evaluating the 
injury-reducing effect of impact absorbing flooring in a nursing home showing 
statistically significant effect. The results from this study are promising, 
indicating the considerable potential of impact absorbing flooring as a 
fall-related injury intervention among frail elderly.

Impacts of metformin and aspirin on life history features and longevity of 
crickets: trade-offs versus cost-free life extension?

We examined the impacts of aspirin and metformin on the life history of the 
cricket Acheta domesticus (growth rate, maturation time, mature body size, 
survivorship, and maximal longevity). Both drugs significantly increased 
survivorship and maximal life span. Maximal longevity was 136 days for controls, 
188 days (138 % of controls) for metformin, and 194 days (143 % of controls) for 
aspirin. Metformin and aspirin in combination extended longevity to a lesser 
degree (163 days, 120 % of controls). Increases in general survivorship were 
even more pronounced, with low-dose aspirin yielding mean longevity 234 % of 
controls (i.e., health span). Metformin strongly reduced growth rates of both 
genders (<60 % of controls), whereas aspirin only slightly reduced the growth 
rate of females and slightly increased that of males. Both drugs delayed 
maturation age relative to controls, but metformin had a much greater impact 
(>140 % of controls) than aspirin (~118 % of controls). Crickets maturing on low 
aspirin showed no evidence of a trade-off between maturation mass and life 
extension. Remarkably, by 100 days of age, aspirin-treated females were 
significantly larger than controls (largely reflecting egg complement). Unlike 
the reigning dietary restriction paradigm, low aspirin conformed to a paradigm 
of "eat more, live longer." In contrast, metformin-treated females were only ~67 
% of the mass of controls. Our results suggest that hormetic agents like 
metformin may derive significant trade-offs with life extension, whereas health 
and longevity benefits may be obtained with less cost by agents like aspirin 
that regulate geroprotective pathways.

In addition to DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation of DNA is recognized as a 
novel epigenetic mark. Primary liver cancers, i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC), are highly prevalent but epigenetically 
poorly characterized, so far. In the present study we measured global 
methylcytosine (mCyt) and hydroxymethylcytosine (hmCyt) in HCC and CC tissues 
and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA to define mCyt and hmCyt 
status and, accordingly, the survival rate. Both mCyt and hmCyt were measured by 
a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method in neoplastic and 
homologous nonneoplastic tissues, i.e., liver and gallbladder, and in PBMCs of 
31 HCC and 16 CC patients. Content of mCyt was notably lower in HCC than in CC 
tissues (3.97% versus 5.26%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Significantly reduced 
mCyt was also detected in HCC compared to nonneoplastic tissue (3.97% versus 
4.82% mCyt, respectively; P < 0.0001), but no such difference was found for CC 
versus homologous nonneoplastic tissue. Hydroxymethylation was significantly 
decreased in HCC versus nonneoplastic liver tissue (0.044 versus 0.128, 
respectively; P < 0.0001) and in CC versus both liver and gallbladder 
nonneoplastic tissue (0.030 versus 0.124, P = 0.026, and 0.030 versus 0.123, 
P = 0.006, respectively). When the survival rate was evaluated according to mCyt 
PBMC content by Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with mCyt ≥5.59% had a 
significantly higher life expectancy than those with mCyt <5.59% (P = 0.034) at 
a follow-up period up to 48 months.
CONCLUSION: A significant DNA hypomethylation distinguishes HCC from CC, while 
DNA hypo-hydroxymethylation characterizes both HCC and CC, and a PBMC DNA mCyt 
content ≥5.59% relates to a favorable outcome in primary liver cancers.

OBJECTIVES: To explore differences in mean costs (from a UK National Health 
Service perspective) and effects of pharmacist-led management of chronic pain in 
primary care evaluated in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), and to 
estimate optimal sample size for a definitive RCT.
DESIGN: Regression analysis of costs and effects, using intention-to-treat and 
expected value of sample information analysis (EVSI).
SETTING: Six general practices: Grampian (3); East Anglia (3).
PARTICIPANTS: 125 patients with complete resource use and short 
form-six-dimension questionnaire (SF-6D) data at baseline, 3 months and 
6 months.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to either pharmacist medication review 
with face-to-face pharmacist prescribing or pharmacist medication review with 
feedback to general practitioner or treatment as usual (TAU).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in mean total costs and effects measured as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 6 months and EVSI for sample size 
calculation.
RESULTS: Unadjusted total mean costs per patient were £452 for prescribing (SD: 
£466), £570 for review (SD: £527) and £668 for TAU (SD: £1333). After 
controlling for baseline costs, the adjusted mean cost differences per patient 
relative to TAU were £77 for prescribing (95% CI -82 to 237) and £54 for review 
(95% CI -103 to 212). Unadjusted mean QALYs were 0.3213 for prescribing (SD: 
0.0659), 0.3161 for review (SD: 0.0684) and 0.3079 for TAU (SD: 0.0606). 
Relative to TAU, the adjusted mean differences were 0.0069 for prescribing (95% 
CI -0.0091 to 0.0229) and 0.0097 for review (95% CI -0.0054 to 0.0248). The EVSI 
suggested the optimal future trial size was between 460 and 690, and between 540 
and 780 patients per arm using a threshold of £30,000 and £20,000 per QALY 
gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TAU, pharmacist-led interventions for chronic pain 
appear more costly and provide similar QALYs. However, these estimates are 
imprecise due to the small size of the pilot trial. The EVSI indicates that a 
larger trial is necessary to obtain more precise estimates of differences in 
mean effects and costs between treatment groups.

AIMS: Sweden and Canada are known for quality of living and exceedingly high 
life expectancy, but recent data on how these countries compare are lacking. We 
measured life expectancy in Canada and Sweden during the past decade, and 
identified factors responsible for changes over time.
METHODS: We calculated life expectancy at birth for Canada and Sweden annually 
from 2000 to 2010, and determined the ages and causes of death responsible for 
the gap between the two countries using Arriaga's method. We determined how 
population growth, ageing, and mortality influenced the number of deaths over 
time.
RESULTS: During 2000-2010, life expectancy in Canada caught up with Sweden for 
men, and surpassed Sweden by 0.4 years for women. Sweden lost ground owing to a 
slower reduction in circulatory and tumour mortality after age 65 years compared 
with Canada. Nonetheless, population ageing increased the number of deaths in 
Canada, especially for mental and nervous system disorders. In Sweden, the 
number of deaths decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: In only one decade, life expectancy in Canada caught up and 
surpassed Sweden due to rapid improvements in circulatory and tumour mortality. 
Population ageing increased the number of deaths in Canada, potentially 
stressing the health care system more than in Sweden.

Sacramento, CA 95817.

BACKGROUND: For children with upper-extremity cerebral palsy (CP) who meet 
standard indications for tendon transfer surgery, we hypothesized that surgical 
treatment would result in greater functional improvement than treatment with 
botulinum toxin injections or regular, ongoing therapy.
METHODS: Thirty-nine children with upper-extremity CP, who were four to sixteen 
years of age and surgical candidates for the transfer of the flexor carpi 
ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis, pronator teres release, and 
extensor pollicis longus rerouting with adductor pollicis release, were 
prospectively assigned, either randomly (twenty-nine patients) or by 
patient/family preference (ten patients), to one of three treatment groups: 
surgical treatment (Group 1); botulinum toxin injections (Group 2); or regular, 
ongoing therapy (Group 3). Seven centers participated. Assessment measurements 
included active range of motion, pinch and grip strength, stereognosis, and 
scores as measured with eight additional functional or patient-oriented outcome 
instruments. Thirty-four patients (twenty-five randomized and nine from the 
patient-preference arm) were evaluated twelve months post-treatment as the study 
cohort.
RESULTS: For the primary outcome of the Shriners Hospital Upper Extremity 
Evaluation (SHUEE) dynamic positional analysis (DPA), significantly greater 
improvement was seen in Group 1 than in the other two groups (p < 0.001). 
Improvements in SHUEE DPA reflected improved supination and wrist extension 
during functional activities after surgical treatment. Group 1 showed more 
improvement in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) CP module domain 
of movement and in the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) score 
for satisfaction than Groups 2 and 3. Both Groups 1 and 3 showed more 
improvement in pinch strength than did Group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: For children with upper-extremity CP who were candidates for 
standard tendon transfer, surgical treatment was demonstrated to provide greater 
improvement, of modest magnitude, than botulinum toxin injections or regular, 
ongoing therapy at twelve months of follow-up for the SHUEE DPA, the PedsQL CP 
module domain of movement, and COPM satisfaction.

INTRODUCTION: Tension-type headache (TTH) is highly prevalent in the general 
population, and it is characterized by increased muscle tenderness with 
increasing headache frequency and intensity.
AIM: The aim of this case-control study was to compare muscle strength in neck 
and shoulder muscles in TTH patients and healthy controls by examining maximal 
voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) during shoulder abduction, neck flexion 
and extension as well as the extension/flexion strength ratio of the neck.
METHODS: Sixty TTH patients and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were 
included. Patients were included if they had TTH ≥8 days per month. The MVC neck 
extensor and flexor muscles were tested with the participant seated upright. MVC 
shoulder abduction was tested with the individual lying supine.
RESULTS: Compared to controls TTH patients had significantly weaker muscle 
strength in neck extension (p = 0.02), resulting in a significantly lower 
extension/flexion moment ratio (p = 0.03). TTH patients also showed a tendency 
toward significantly lower muscle strength in shoulder abduction (p = 0.05). 
Among the 60 TTH patients, 25 had frequent episodic TTH (FETTH), and 35 had 
chronic TTH (CTTH).
CONCLUSION: Patients with TTH exhibited decreased muscle strength in the neck 
extensor muscles, inducing a reduced cervical extension/flexion ratio compared 
to healthy people.

We describe a Mesozoic fish Paralycoptera sp. (Teleostei: Osteoglossoidei), on 
the basis of a postcranial skeleton collected from the volcaniclastic mudstones 
of the Lai Chi Chong Formation of Hong Kong, China. The new finding-representing 
the city's first Mesozoic fish-extends the geographical distribution of 
Paralycoptera from eastern mainland China into Hong Kong, demonstrating a wider 
distribution than previously appreciated for this genus. A radiometric age for 
the Lai Chi Chong Formation of 146.6 ± 0.2 Ma implies a temporal range expansion 
for Paralycoptera of approximately 40 million years back from the Early 
Cretaceous (∼110 Ma). However, spores found in the Formation suggest an Early 
Cretaceous age that is consistent with the existing age assignment to 
Paralycoptera. We argue that the proposed temporal range extension is genuine 
because it is based on recent high precision radiometric age data, but given the 
discrepancies with the biostratigraphic ages further investigation is needed to 
confirm this. This study provides an important step towards revealing Hong 
Kong's Mesozoic vertebrate fauna and understanding its relationship to 
well-studied mainland Chinese ones.

Korea.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study introduces methods for estimating the cost of liver 
disease and presents useful and reliable sources of data. The available evidence 
on the costs associated with liver disease is also discussed.
METHODS: Costing methodology can be used to identify, measure, and value 
relevant resources incurred during the care of patients with liver diseases. It 
adjusts for discounting, skewed distribution, and missing or censored cost data. 
The human capital approach for productivity cost assumes that deceased patients 
would have lived to a normal expected life expectancy, and have earned a salary 
in line with the current age profile of wages, in order to measure potential 
earnings lost due to premature death or job loss.
EVIDENCE: The number of deaths due to liver cancer (C22) increased from 6,384 in 
1983 to 11,405 in 2013, while deaths due to other liver diseases (K70-K76) 
increased from 12,563 in 1983 to 13,458 in 1995, and then declined to 6,665 in 
2013. According to the Global Burden of Disease study conducted by the World 
Health Organization, liver cancer caused 325,815 disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and cirrhosis of the liver caused 206,917 DALYs in 2012. The total cost 
of liver disease was estimated at 1,941 billion Korean won in 2001 and 5,689 
billion Korean won in 2008. Much of this cost is attributable to productivity 
cost, and especially that of economically active men.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of liver disease is immense because of the 
associated high mortality and morbidity, especially among the economically 
active population. This indicates the need to prioritize the development of 
appropriate health interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological models for estimating the prevalence and burden of 
disease inform health policy and service planning decisions. Our aim was to 
describe the challenges in evaluating such models using the example of 
epidemiological models for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Two reviewers searched Medline, Embase, CAB Abstracts and World Health 
Organization (WHO) Databases from 1980 to November 2013 for epidemiological 
models of COPD prevalence and burden. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed 
the quality of the studies. We then undertook a descriptive and narrative 
synthesis of data.
RESULTS: We identified 22 models employing a variety of techniques to calculate 
the prevalence and/or burden of COPD. Models calculated prevalence and/or 
mortality or other facet of disease burden using demographics and risk factors 
or trends, Markov-type modelling and microsimulation modelling. The six models 
which scored highly on the quality framework were: the Peabody model, which 
generated estimates of COPD prevalence; the WHO DISMOD II model which produced 
burden estimates in terms of disability adjusted life years with COPD and life 
years lost to COPD; the Atsou model which gave the life expectancy gains of 
individual smokers who quit smoking and associated costs; two Dutch COPD models 
which produced estimates of mortality and health care costs related to COPD; and 
the Pichon-Riviere model which gave the costs and cost effectiveness of smoking 
quit programmes.
CONCLUSIONS: The field of chronic disease modelling is burgeoning. As a result, 
policy makers need to understand how to interpret epidemiological models and 
their data sources.

Research Institute ; La Jolla , CA USA.

Macroautophagy is a major intracellular degradation process recognized as 
playing a central role in cell survival and longevity. This multistep process is 
extensively regulated at several levels, including post-translationally through 
the action of conserved longevity factors such as the nutrient sensor TOR. More 
recently, transcriptional regulation of autophagy genes has emerged as an 
important mechanism for ensuring the somatic maintenance and homeostasis 
necessary for a long life span. Autophagy is increased in many long-lived model 
organisms and contributes significantly to their longevity. In turn, conserved 
transcription factors, particularly the helix-loop-helix transcription factor 
TFEB and the forkhead transcription factor FOXO, control the expression of many 
autophagy-related genes and are important for life-span extension. In this 
review, we discuss recent progress in understanding the contribution of these 
transcription factors to macroautophagy regulation in the context of aging. We 
also review current research on epigenetic changes, such as histone modification 
by the deacetylase SIRT1, that influence autophagy-related gene expression and 
additionally affect aging. Understanding the molecular regulation of 
macroautophagy in relation to aging may offer new avenues for the treatment of 
age-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Currently there is controversy surrounding the optimal way to treat 
patients with prostate cancer in the post-prostatectomy setting. Adjuvant 
therapies carry possible benefits of improved curative results, but there is 
uncertainty in which patients should receive adjuvant therapy. There are 
concerns about giving toxicity to a whole population for the benefit of only a 
subset. We hypothesized that making post-prostatectomy treatment decisions using 
genomics-based risk prediction estimates would improve cancer and quality of 
life outcomes.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition model to simulate outcomes over a 10 
year horizon for a cohort of post-prostatectomy patients. Outcomes included 
cancer progression rates at 5 and 10 years, overall survival, and 
quality-adjusted survival with reductions for treatment, side effects, and 
cancer stage. We compared outcomes using population-level versus 
individual-level risk of cancer progression, and for genomics-based care versus 
usual care treatment recommendations.
RESULTS: Cancer progression outcomes, expected life-years (LYs), and expected 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were significantly different when individual 
genomics-based cancer progression risk estimates were used in place of 
population-level risk estimates. Use of the genomic classifier to guide 
treatment decisions provided small, but statistically significant, improvements 
in model outcomes. We observed an additional 0.03 LYs and 0.07 QALYs, a 12% 
relative increase in the 5-year recurrence-free survival probability, and a 4% 
relative reduction in the 5-year probability of metastatic disease or death.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of genomics-based risk prediction to guide treatment 
decisions may improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients. This study offers a 
framework for individualized decision analysis, and can be extended to 
incorporate a wide range of personal attributes to enable delivery of 
patient-centered tools for informed decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to incorporate an estimate of risk for asbestos 
exposure in the Canadian Cancer Risk Management Lung Cancer (CRMM-LC) 
microsimulation model.
METHODS: In CRMM-LC, a 3-year probability of developing lung cancer can be 
derived from different risk profiles. An asbestos-exposed cohort was simulated 
and different scenarios of low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening 
were simulated.
RESULTS: As annual LDCT screening among non-asbestos-exposed individuals is less 
cost-effective than biennial screening, all the scenarios modeled for an 
asbestos-exposed cohort were biennial. For individuals with a two-fold risk of 
asbestos-induced lung cancer to be eligible for biennial LDCT screening, a 
smoking history of ≥15 pack-years would be necessary. For non-smokers with 
asbestos exposure resulting in a relative risk (RR) for lung cancer, it is not 
cost-effective to screen those with a RR of 5, but it is cost-effective to 
screen those with a RR of 10 (the heavily exposed).
CONCLUSION: Asbestos-exposed individuals with an estimated two-fold or more risk 
of lung cancer from asbestos-exposure are eligible for LDCT screening at all 
ages from 55-74 years if they have a cigarette smoking history of ≥15 
pack-years. Asbestos-exposed individuals who are lifelong non-smokers are 
eligible for LDCT screening at all ages from 55-74 years if they have 
accumulated a degree of asbestos exposure resulting in an estimated risk of lung 
cancer of ≥10.

BACKGROUND: The development of biologics has greatly increased the quality of 
life and the life expectancy of many patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
However, a large number of these patients have an increased risk of developing 
serious infections. The aim of this study was to examine differential effects of 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment and CTLA4 immunoglobulin (Ig) 
treatment on both immunological response and host defense in a murine model of 
septic arthritis.
METHODS: Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig), etanercept (anti-TNF), or phosphate-buffered 
saline were given to NMRI mice intravenously inoculated with Staphylococcus 
aureus. The clinical course of septic arthritis and histopathological and 
radiological changes of joints were compared among the groups.
RESULTS: Mice receiving CTLA4-Ig treatment had more-severe septic arthritis, 
compared with controls and mice receiving anti-TNF treatment. Anti-TNF treatment 
led to more-severe weight loss and kidney abscesses, as well as a higher 
bacterial burden in the kidneys. Mice receiving CTLA4-Ig therapy had lower serum 
levels of interleukin 4, whereas mice receiving anti-TNF therapy had higher 
levels of TNF-α. Both iNOS and arginase-1 expression were reduced in peritoneal 
macrophages from mice receiving CTLA4-Ig, compared with expression in the 
anti-TNF group.
CONCLUSIONS: CTLA4-Ig therapy significantly increased the susceptibility to S. 
aureus septic arthritis in mice, whereas anti-TNF therapy deteriorated host 
bacterial clearance, resulting in more-severe weight loss and kidney abscesses.

Given the overwhelming quantity of information available from the environment, 
how do young learners know what to learn about and what to ignore? We found that 
11-month-old infants (N = 110) used violations of prior expectations as special 
opportunities for learning. The infants were shown events that violated 
expectations about object behavior or events that were nearly identical but did 
not violate expectations. The sight of an object that violated expectations 
enhanced learning and promoted information-seeking behaviors; specifically, 
infants learned more effectively about objects that committed violations, 
explored those objects more, and engaged in hypothesis-testing behaviors that 
reflected the particular kind of violation seen. Thus, early in life, expectancy 
violations offer a wedge into the problem of what to learn.

Hospital, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: There is a scarcity of literature reporting hospital costs for 
treating out of hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) survivors, especially within the 
UK. This is essential for assessment of cost-effectiveness of interventions 
necessary to allow just allocation of resources within the National Health 
Service. We set out primarily to calculate costs stratified against hospital 
survival and neurological outcomes. Secondarily, we estimated cost effectiveness 
based on estimates of survival and utility from previous studies to calculate 
costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY).
SETTING: We performed a single centre (London) retrospective review of 
in-hospital costs of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OOHCA over 18 months 
from January 2011 (following widespread introduction of targeted temperature 
management and primary percutaneous intervention).
PARTICIPANTS: Of 69 successive patients admitted over an 18-month period, 
survival and cerebral performance category (CPC) outcomes were obtained from 
review of databases and clinical notes. The Trust finance department supplied 
ICU and hospital costs using the Payment by Results UK system.
RESULTS: Of those patients with ROSC admitted to ICU, survival to hospital 
discharge (any CPC) was 33/69 (48%) with 26/33 survivors in CPC 1-2 at hospital 
discharge. Cost per survivor to hospital discharge (including total cost of 
survivors and non-survivors) was £50,000, cost per CPC 1-2 survivor was £65,000. 
Cost and length of stay of CPC 1-2 patients was considerably lower than CPC 3-4 
patients. The majority of the costs (69%) related to intensive care. Estimated 
cost per CPC 1-2 survivor per QALY was £16,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The costs of in-hospital patient care for ICU admissions following 
ROSC after OOHCA are considerable but within a reasonable threshold when 
assessed from a QALY perspective.
