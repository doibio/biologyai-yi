The application of high-throughput genotyping or sequencing data helps us to 
understand the genomic response to natural and artificial selection. In this 
study, we scanned the genomes of five indigenous buffalo populations belong to 
three recognized breeds, adapted to different geographical and agro-ecological 
zones in Iran, to unravel the extent of genomic diversity and to localize 
genomic regions and genes underwent past selection. A total of 46 river buffalo 
whole genomes, from West and East Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Khuzestan 
provinces, were resequenced. Our sequencing data reached to a coverage above 99% 
of the river buffalo reference genome and an average read depth around 9.2× per 
sample. We identified 20.55 million SNPs, including 63,097 missense, 707 
stop-gain, and 159 stop-loss mutations that might have functional consequences. 
Genomic diversity analyses showed modest structuring among Iranian buffalo 
populations following frequent gene flow or admixture in the recent past. 
Evidence of positive selection was investigated using both differentiation (Fst) 
and fixation (Pi) metrics. Analysis of fixation revealed three genomic regions 
in all three breeds with aberrant polymorphism contents on BBU2, 20, and 21. 
Fixation signal on BBU2 overlapped with the OCA2-HERC2 genes, suggestive of 
adaptation to UV exposure through pigmentation mechanism. Further validation 
using resequencing data from other five bovine species as well as the Axiom 
Buffalo Genotyping Array 90K data of river and swamp buffaloes indicated that 
these fixation signals persisted across river and swamp buffaloes and extended 
to taurine cattle, implying an ancient evolutionary event occurred before the 
speciation of buffalo and taurine cattle. These results contributed to our 
understanding of major genetic switches that took place during the evolution of 
modern buffaloes.

IMPORTANCE: United States primary school closures during the 2020 coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected millions of children, with little 
understanding of the potential health outcomes associated with educational 
disruption.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with 
the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining 
open.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model estimated the 
association between school closures and reduced educational attainment and the 
association between reduced educational attainment and life expectancy using 
publicly available data sources, including data for 2020 from the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, the US Social Security Administration, and the 
US Census Bureau. Direct COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality 
that might have resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of 
COVID-19 were also estimated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Years of life lost.
RESULTS: A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended public 
schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a median of 54 
(interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed instruction was 
associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95% credible interval [CI], 0.10-0.65) 
years of final educational attainment for boys and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.46) 
years for girls. Summed across the population, an estimated 5.53 million (95% 
CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be associated with school closures. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 88 241 US deaths from 
COVID-19 through the end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95% CI, 
1.23-1.85 million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95% 
credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as a 
result, based on results of studies associating school closure with decreased 
pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated YLL under both 
"schools open" and "schools closed" conditions, the analysis observed a 98.1% 
probability that school opening would have been associated with a lower total 
YLL than school closure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this decision analytical model of years of life 
potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the analysis 
favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding school closures 
during the pandemic should consider the association between educational 
disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give greater weight to the 
potential outcomes of school closure on children's health.

The genetic paradigms of dietary restriction fail to extend life span in 
cep-1(gk138) mutant of C. elegans p53 due to possible background mutations.

Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span and improves health in most model 
systems tested, including non-human primates. In C. elegans, as in other models, 
DR leads to reprogramming of metabolism, improvements in mitochondrial health, 
large changes in expression of cytoprotective genes and better proteostasis. 
Understandably, multiple global transcriptional regulators like transcription 
factors FOXO/DAF-16, FOXA/PHA-4, HSF1/HSF-1 and NRF2/SKN-1 are important for DR 
longevity. Considering the wide-ranging effects of p53 on organismal biology, we 
asked whether the C. elegans ortholog, CEP-1 is required for DR-mediated 
longevity assurance. We employed the widely-used TJ1 strain of cep-1(gk138). We 
show that cep-1(gk138) suppresses the life span extension of two genetic 
paradigms of DR, but two non-genetic modes of DR remain unaffected in this 
strain. We find that two aspects of DR, increased autophagy and up-regulation of 
the expression of cytoprotective xenobiotic detoxification program (cXDP) genes, 
are dampened in cep-1(gk138). Importantly, we find that background mutation(s) 
in the strain may be the actual cause for the phenotypic differences that we 
observed and cep-1 may not be directly involved in genetic DR-mediated longevity 
assurance in worms. Identifying these mutation(s) may reveal a novel regulator 
of longevity required specifically by genetic modes of DR.

The primary cell walls of plants provide mechanical strength while maintaining 
the flexibility needed for cell extension growth. Cell extension involves 
loosening the bonds between cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses and pectins. 
Pectins have been implicated in this process, but it remains unclear if this 
depends on the abundance of certain pectins, their modifications, and/or 
structure. Here, cell wall-related mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis were 
characterized by biochemical and immunohistochemical methods and 
Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. Mutants with reduced pectin or 
hemicellulose content showed no root cell elongation in response to simulated 
drought stress, in contrast to wild-type plants or mutants with reduced 
cellulose content. While no association was found between the degrees of pectin 
methylesterification and cell elongation, cell wall composition analysis 
suggested an important role of the pectin rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII), which 
was corroborated in experiments with the RGII-modifying chemical 2β-deoxy-Kdo. 
The results were complemented by expression analysis of cell wall synthesis 
genes and microscopic analysis of cell wall porosity. It is concluded that a 
certain amount of pectin is necessary for stress-induced root cell elongation, 
and hypotheses regarding the mechanistic basis of this result are formulated.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term safety and 
tolerability outcomes in two open-label extension (OLE) studies of adjunctive 
eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in children with focal seizures.
METHODS: Safety data from patients aged 4-17 years in OLEs of Studies 2093-208 
and -305 were pooled and analyzed. Studies 208 and 305 were randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adjunctive treatment with ESL in 
children with focal seizures refractory to treatment with 1-2 antiseizure drugs; 
patients could continue into uncontrolled OLEs (up to 5 years total duration). 
The OLEs evaluated the safety and tolerability of ESL (10-30 mg/kg/day; maximum 
1200 mg/day).
RESULTS: The 1-year OLE and post-1-year OLE safety populations comprised 337 and 
177 ESL-treated patients, respectively. The overall incidence of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with ESL was 64.1% during the 1-year 
OLE and 52.5% during the post-1-year OLE. Nasopharyngitis, partial seizures, 
vomiting, pyrexia, headache, somnolence, and respiratory tract infection were 
the most frequently reported TEAEs during the 1-year OLE. The overall incidence 
of serious adverse events (AEs) was 8.9% during the 1-year OLE and 10.2% during 
the post-1-year OLE. Partial seizures (1.2%) and pneumonia (1.2%) were the most 
frequently reported serious AEs during the 1-year OLE. The overall incidence of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 4.2% during the 1-year OLE and 0.6% during 
the post-1-year OLE. Partial seizures (1.5%) was the most frequently reported 
TEAE leading to discontinuation during the 1-year OLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term treatment with ESL was generally well tolerated 
in pediatric patients aged 4-17 years with focal seizures. TEAEs were comparable 
to those observed in adults with no new events of concern.

Background: The identification of factors that alter postural stability is 
fundamental in the design of interventions to maintain independence and 
mobility. This is especially important for women because of their longer life 
expectancy and higher incidence of falls than in men. We constructed the 
percentile box charts and determined the values of reference for the 
accelerometric assessment of the gait in women. Methods: We used a 
cross-sectional study with 1096 healthy adult women, who were asked to walk a 
distance of 20 m three times. Results: In all of the variables, a reduction in 
the magnitude of accelerations was detected as the age of the group advanced. 
The box charts show the amplitude of the interquartile ranges, which increases 
as the age of the participants advances. In addition, the interquartile ranges 
were greater in the variables that refer to the maximum values of the 
accelerations. Conclusions: The values obtained can be used to assess changes in 
gait due to aging, trauma and orthopaedic alterations that may alter postural 
stability and neurodegenerative processes that increase the risk of falling.

In the 2000s, Russia was globally one of the top 5 countries with the highest 
levels of alcohol per capita consumption and prevailing risky patterns of 
drinking, i.e., high intake per occasion, high proportion of people drinking to 
intoxication, and high frequency of situations where alcohol is consumed and 
tolerated. In 2009, in response to these challenges, the Russian government 
formed the Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation and published a 
national strategy concept to reduce alcohol abuse and alcohol-dependence at the 
population level for the period 2010-2020. The objectives of the present 
contribution are to analyze the evidence base of the core components of the 
concept and to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework of measures 
implemented (process evaluation) and the achievement of the formulated targets 
(effect evaluation). Most of the concept's measures were found to be 
evidence-based and aligned with eight out of 10 areas of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) policy portfolio. Out of the 14 tasks, 7 were rated as 
achieved, and 7 as partly achieved. Ten years after the concept's adoption, 
alcohol consumption seems to have declined by about a third and alcohol is 
conceptualized as a broad risk factor for the population's health in Russia.

Breast cancer was one of the first malignancies to benefit from targeted 
therapy, i.e., treatments directed against specific markers. Inhibitors against 
HER2 are a significant example and they improved the life expectancy of a large 
cohort of patients. Research on new biomarkers, therefore, is always current and 
important. AXL, a member of the TYRO-3, AXL and MER (TAM) subfamily, is, today, 
considered a predictive and prognostic biomarker in many tumor contexts, 
primarily breast cancer. Its oncogenic implications make it an ideal target for 
the development of new pharmacological agents; moreover, its recent role as 
immune-modulator makes AXL particularly attractive to researchers involved in 
the study of interactions between cancer and the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
All these peculiarities characterize AXL as compared to other members of the TAM 
family. In this review, we will illustrate the biological role played by AXL in 
breast tumor cells, highlighting its molecular and biological features, its 
involvement in tumor progression and its implication as a target in ongoing 
clinical trials.

Many factors, including postponement of marriage, increased life expectancy, and 
improved success with assisted reproductive technologies have been contributing 
to increased paternal age in developed nations. This increased average paternal 
age has led to concerns about adverse effects of advanced paternal age on sperm

OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to predict disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY) rate in Japan through 2040 with plausible future scenarios of fruit 
intake for neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes and kidney 
diseases (DKD).
DESIGN: Data from National Health and Nutrition Surveys and the Global Burden of 
Diseases study in 2017 were used. We developed an autoregressive integrated 
moving average model with four future scenarios. Reference scenario maintains 
the current trend. Best scenario assumes that the goal defined in Health Japan 
21 is achieved in 2023 and is kept constant afterwards. Moderate scenario 
assumes that the goal is achieved in 2040. Constant scenario applies the same 
proportion of 2016 for the period between 2017 and 2040.
SETTING: DALY rates in Japan were predicted for the period between 2017 and 
2040.
PARTICIPANTS: Population aged more than than 20 years old.
RESULTS: In our reference forecast, the DALY rates in all-ages group were 
projected to be stable for CVD and continue increasing for neoplasms and DKD. 
Age group-specific DALY rates for these three disease groups were forecasted to 
decrease, with some exceptions. Among men aged 20-49 years, DALY attributable to 
CVD differed substantially between the scenarios, implying that there is a 
significant potential for reducing the burden of CVD by increasing fruit intake 
at the population level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our scenario analysis shows that higher fruit intake is associated 
with lower disease burden in Japan. Further research is required to assess which 
policies and interventions can be used to achieve an increase in fruit intake as 
modelled in the scenarios of the current study.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a non-specific intestinal inflammatory disease. UC 
occurred in developed countries in the past, but in the past 20 years, the 
incidence of UC in developing countries has also shown a clear upward trend. The 
hospitalization rate and surgical rate of UC have been high, and may lead to the 
occurrence of intestinal malignant tumors, which has greatly affected the 
quality of life and life expectancy of patients. Because of this, how to 
effectively treat UC has become a hotspot in modern gastrointestinal diseases. 
Due to the limitation of the dosage form of the drug and the special environment 
of the gastrointestinal tract, traditional oral drugs have the disadvantage of 
not being able to make the drug effective in specific lesions when treating 
inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, it is of great scientific significance 
and application value to develop drug carriers that can target the inflammatory 
sites and slow-release drugs to treat inflammation. In this study, TNBS method 
was used to prepare a rat model of ulcerative colitis, and the effect of 
modified porous silicon nanoparticles as a drug carrier in the treatment of UC 
was investigated. We first induced acute enteritis model in C57BL/6 rats through 
TNBS, and then used in vivo fluorescence imaging and immunofluorescence staining 
technology to prove that porous silicon nanoparticles can indeed be specifically 
concentrated in the damaged part of the mouse intestine, and then administered 
by gastric administration. The drug method allows rats to take different types 
and concentrations of drug-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles, and finally 
collect relevant samples for evaluation of drug efficacy after the end of the 
administration cycle. The disease activity index showed the best 
gastrointestinal recovery in mice treated with modified drug-loaded porous 
silicon nanoparticles. The pathological analysis of rat colons using HE staining 
proved that the improved drug-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles had a more 
significant therapeutic effect. TUNEL staining results showed that the level of 
apoptosis in the colon injury site of rats treated with modified drug-loaded 
porous silicon nanoparticles was reduced. The test results of drug concentration 
in rat colon tissue blood also proved that porous silicon nanoparticle 
drug-loading system can reduce the release of inflammatory factors in vivo. 
Based on the TNBS-induced UC rat model, this paper evaluates the therapeutic 
effect of modified drug-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles. The results show 
that in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, the nanoparticle drug-loaded system 
is a more effective treatment way.

Drought is a persistent, sluggish natural disaster in developing countries that 
has generated a financial burden and an unstable climate. Farmers should adopt 
early warning systems (EWS) in their strategies for monitoring drought to reduce 
its serious consequences. However, farmers in developing countries are reluctant 
to use EWS as their management strategies. Hence, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the decision of farmers to use climate knowledge through the model 
of farming activity in Kermanshah Township, Iran. A surveyor questionnaire was 
used to gather data from 370 wheat farmers using random sampling methods in 
multi-stage clusters. Results revealed that the decision to use climate 
information is affected by personal factors, attitude towards climate 
information, objectives of using climate information, and external/physical 
farming factors. The result of this study has implications for drought 
management practitioners. To be specific, the results can aid policymakers to 
design early alert programs to minimize the risk of drought and thus move from 
conventional to climate smart agriculture.

Do a country's economic structures matter for its national health status? This 
study, for the first time, examines the extent to which the mix of products a 
country produces (and exports) affects population health. For this purpose, I 
employ the economic complexity index (ECI) that relies on the sophistication of 
export bundles to extract information on the availability of productive 
capabilities within an economy. Using unbalanced panel data for 103 countries 
between 1970 and 2015, this paper documents strong and robust evidence that 
countries exporting complex (high productivity) products, on average, enjoy 
better health outcomes, compared with those whose economic structures are mainly 
based on unsophisticated (low productivity) products. Additionally, there exists 
evidence that a key channel through which ECI transmits to health improvements 
is via strengthening employment opportunities. It follows from these findings 
that health improvements can be fostered by structural transformation toward 
producing a more diverse range of sophisticated products.

BACKGROUND: With extending life expectancy, more people are diagnosed with 
cutaneous malignancies at advanced ages and are offered nonsurgical treatment. 
We assessed outcomes of the oldest-old adults after electrochemotherapy (ECT).
METHODS: The International Network for Sharing Practices of ECT (InspECT) 
registry was queried for adults aged ≥90 years (ys) with skin cancers/cutaneous 
metastases of any histotype who underwent bleomycin-ECT (2006-2019). These were 
subanalysed with patients aged <90 ys after matching 1:2 for tumor location, 
number, size, histotype, and previous treatments. We assessed ECT modalities, 
toxicity (CTCAE), response (RECIST), and patient perception (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients represented the study cohort (median 92 ys, range 
92-104), 122 the control group (median 77 ys, range 23-89). Among the 
oldest-old, 44 patients (72%) had primary/recurrent skin cancers, 17 (28%) 
cutaneous metastases. Median tumour size was 15 mm (range, 5-450). The 
oldest-old adults underwent ECT mainly under local/regional anaesthesia (59% vs 
39% p = .012). We observed no differences regarding dose and route of 
chemotherapy (intravenous vs intratumoral, p = .308), electrode geometry (linear 
vs hexagonal, p = .172) and procedural duration (18 vs 21 min, p = .378). 
Complete response (57.4 [95%-CI 44.1%-70.0%] vs 64.7% [95%-CI 55.6%-73.2%], 
p = .222) and 1-year local control (76.7% vs 81.7, p = .092) rates were 
comparable. Pain and skin hyperpigmentation were mild in both groups. Skin 
ulceration persisted longer in the oldest-old patients (4.4 vs 2.4 months, 
p = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: The oldest-old adults with cutaneous malignancies undergo ECT most 
commonly under local/regional anaesthesia with safety profiles and clinical 
effectiveness similar to their younger counterparts, except in case of ulcerated 
tumors.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate life expectancy at the local authority level and detect 
those areas that have a substantially low life expectancy after accounting for 
deprivation.
DESIGN: We used registration data from the Office for National Statistics on 
mortality and population in England, by local authority, age group and 
socioeconomic deprivation decile, for both men and women over the period 
2001-2018. We used a statistical model within the Bayesian framework to produce 
robust mortality rates, which were then transformed to life expectancy 
estimates. A rule based on exceedance probabilities was used to detect local 
authorities characterised by a low life expectancy among areas with a similar 
deprivation level from 2012 onwards.
RESULTS: We confirmed previous findings showing differences in the life 
expectancy gap between the most and least deprived areas from 2012 to 2018. We 
found variations in life expectancy trends across local authorities, and we 
detected a number of those with a low life expectancy when compared with others 
of a similar deprivation level.
CONCLUSIONS: There are factors other than deprivation that are responsible for 
low life expectancy in certain local authorities. Further investigation on the 
detected areas can help understand better the stalling of life expectancy which 
was observed from 2012 onwards and plan efficient public health policies.

Wild bee decline has been reported worldwide. Some bumblebee species (Bombus 
spp.) have declined in Europe and North America, and their ranges have shrunk 
due to climate and land cover changes. In countries with limited historical and 
current occurrence data, it is often difficult to investigate bumblebee range 
shifts. Here we estimated the past/present distributions of six major bumblebee 
species in Japan with species distribution modeling using current occurrence 
data and past/present climate and land cover data. The differences identified 
between estimated past and present distributions indicate possible range shifts. 
The estimated ranges of B. diversus, B. hypocrita, B. ignitus, B. honshuensis, 
and B. beaticola shrank over the past 26 years, but that of B. ardens expanded. 
The lower altitudinal limits of the estimated ranges became higher as 
temperature increased. When focusing on the effects of land cover change, the 
estimated range of B. diversus slightly shrank due to an increase in forest 
area. Such increase in forest area may result from the abandonment of 
agricultural lands and the extension of the rotation time of planted coniferous 
forests and secondary forests. Managing old planted coniferous forests and 
secondary forests will be key to bumblebee conservation for adaptation to 
climate change.

University, Satellite Campus, Vadtal Road, Bakrol, Anand, 388315 Gujarat India.

The present study was focused to isolate the bioactive compounds present in the 
leaves of Moringa oleifera which contains a high nutritional value. Furthermore, 
the research was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-aging, and 
anti-neurodegenerative properties of M. oleifera using the experimental model 
Caenorhabditis elegans. The separation of compounds from the crude extract and 
its identification was carried out through TLC, Column chromatography, UV 
absorption spectroscopy, and GC-MS. The compounds identified in most abundant 
fraction of column chromatography were [Phenol-2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)- 
phosphite (3:1)] and Tetratetracontane. The result suggests that the leaves 
extracts and column fraction were able to significantly extend the life span of 
the N2 wild-type strain of C. elegans. The most potent life span extending 
effect was displayed by the dichloromethane extract of leaves which was 
21.73 ± 0.142 days compared to the control (16.55 ± 0.02 days). It could also 
extend the health span through improved physiological functions such as 
pharyngeal pumping, body bending, and reversal frequency with increased age. The 
treated worms were also exhibited improved resistance to thermal stress, 
oxidative stress, and reduced intracellular ROS accumulation. Moreover, the 
leaves extract could elicit neuroprotection as it could delay the paralysis in 
the transgenic strain of C. elegans 'CL4176' integrated with Aβ. Interestingly, 
The RNAi experiment demonstrated that the extended life span under the treatment 
of extracts and the compound was daf-16 dependent. In transgenic C. elegans 
TJ356, the DAF-16 transcription factor was localized in the nucleus under the 
stress conditions, further supported the involvement of the daf-16 gene in 
longevity. Overall, the study suggests the potential of M. oleifera as a dietary 
supplement and alternative medicine to defend against oxidative stress and 
aging.
