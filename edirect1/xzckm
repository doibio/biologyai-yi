INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Providing and enhancing the level of health are one 
of the essential needs of all people, and implementation of health promotion 
lifestyle is the most important and effective factor in maintaining and 
improving the health of the elderly. The present study aimed at defining the 
effect of aging on health-promoting lifestyle.
METHODOLOGY: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 72 individuals from 
the retirees clubs of Education department, Social Security, and Health centers 
in Ramsar, in 2017. Sampling was done randomly with blocking and random 
allocation in two groups: Experimental and control. Data were collected in two 
steps by Demographic profile questionnaire, AMT, ADL, OHI and HPlP II which 
validity and reliability of them were confirmed. Participants attended eight 
training sessions (twice each week). Data analysis was performed with the use of 
SPSS 18 and descriptive (Frequency) and analytic tests (Chi-square, Fisher's 
exact test, Independent Sample t test and Paired Sample t test) with a 
significance level of 0.05.
RESULTS: The results showed that the mean age of the elderly was 64.4 ± 4.1 
years. The mean score of lifestyle enhancement was 148.59 and 173.25 before and 
after training in the experimental group, respectively. Based on the results of 
paired t-test (P < 0. 323), there was no significant difference between the mean 
life expectancy of elderly health promotion in control group before and after 
educational intervention; however, there was a significant difference between 
the two groups before and after training (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Educational programs play an important role in integrating 
health-promoting lifestyle to encourage the elderly to accept more 
accountability regarding health, sustained physical fitness, proper nutrition, 
healthy interpersonal relationships, expected spiritual growth, and the proper 
management of stress and anxiety in life.

As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single 
technology appraisal process, brodalumab was assessed to determine the clinical 
and cost effectiveness of its use in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health 
Economics Technology Assessment Group at the University of York were 
commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article 
provides a summary of the Evidence Review Group's review of the company's 
submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance issued in 
March 2018. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from three 
well-conducted, multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trials. The 
trials demonstrated that brodalumab statistically significantly reduced the 
severity of psoriasis and its impact on health-related quality of life, compared 
with placebo, at 12 weeks. In comparison with ustekinumab, statistically 
significantly more patients taking brodalumab had reduced psoriasis severity at 
12 weeks. Psoriasis severity and quality of life also appeared improved at 
52 weeks, although statistical significance was not assessed. Withdrawal rates 
were comparable to drug survival rates of other biological therapies and rates 
of adverse events were similar between brodalumab and ustekinumab. A network 
meta-analysis was presented, comparing brodalumab with other therapies available 
at the same point in the treatment pathway (i.e. in patients for whom standard 
systemic therapy or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or 
contraindicated). The network meta-analysis ranked treatments in order of 
effectiveness, in terms of achieving different levels of Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index response. The results indicated that brodalumab had a similar 
probability of response to ixekizumab, secukinumab and infliximab and a higher 
probability of response than ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, apremilast, 
dimethyl fumarate and placebo. The company's economic model compared nine 
treatment sequences that included three lines of active therapy, consisting of 
brodalumab and other comparators recommended by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence, followed by best supportive care. The sequence with 
brodalumab in the first-line position dominated sequences that started with 
adalimumab, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of the brodalumab sequence compared to less effective 
and non-dominated sequences ranged from £7145 (vs. the etanercept sequence) to 
£13,353 (vs. the dimethyl fumarate sequence) per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the more costly and 
effective ixekizumab sequence was £894,010 per quality-adjusted life-year gained 
compared to the brodalumab sequence. At a threshold of £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, the brodalumab sequence had the highest 
probability of being cost effective (96%). The main limitation of the company's 
economic model was the restrictive nature of the sequences compared. Twelve 
separate scenarios based on key uncertainties were explored by the Evidence 
Review Group. The only scenarios where brodalumab was ranked lower than first 
were not considered to be more appropriate or plausible than the assumptions or 
scenarios included in the company's base case. The treatment rankings identified 
in the Evidence Review Group's alternative base case were identical to those 
derived from the company's base case model. At the first National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee concluded 
that brodalumab appears to be as effective as other anti-interleukin-17 agents 
and is cost effective, based on the discount agreed in the patient access 
scheme. Brodalumab is recommended as an option for treating adults with severe 
plaque psoriasis (defined by a total Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 
10 or more and a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of more than 10) who have 
not responded to other systemic non-biological therapies. Brodalumab should be 
stopped at 12 weeks if the psoriasis has not responded adequately.

PURPOSE: Recent studies suggested that olanzapine, together with dexamethasone 
and serotonin-3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), is effective in preventing 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy (HEC). This regimen is particularly useful in Southeast Asia (SEA) 
countries where resources are limited. We aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of incorporating olanzapine into standard antiemetic regimens 
for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC among SEA countries.
METHODS: Using a decision tree model, clinical and economic outcomes associated 
with olanzapine-containing regimen and standard antiemetic regimen (doublet 
antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 5HT3RA) in most SEA countries 
except in Singapore (triplet antiemetic regimen: dexamethasone+first generation 
5HT3RA + aprepitant) for CINV prevention following HEC were evaluated. This 
analysis was performed in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, using 
societal perspective method with 5-day time horizon. Input parameters were 
derived from literature, network meta-analysis, government documents, and 
hospital databases. Outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 
USD/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of sensitivity analyses 
including probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed.
RESULTS: Compared to doublet antiemetic regimen, addition of olanzapine resulted 
in incremental QALY of 0.0022-0.0026 with cost saving of USD 2.98, USD 27.71, 
and USD 52.20 in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, respectively. Compared to 
triplet antiemetic regimen, switching aprepitant to olanzapine yields additional 
0.0005 QALY with cost saving of USD 60.91 in Singapore. The probability of being 
cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 GDP/capita varies from 
14.7 to 85.2% across countries.
CONCLUSION: The use of olanzapine as part of standard antiemetic regimen is 
cost-effective for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving HEC in multiple 
SEA countries.

We study the differential impacts of public and private sources of health 
spending on health outcomes using a triple difference approach. We find that 
private health spending has on average a higher health-promoting effect than 
public health spending. This result is robust with respect to the choice of 
outcome measure and covariates in the regression and driven primarily by the 
countries with ineffective governments. Once we restrict our sample to countries 
with effective governments, private health spending is found to be no better 
than public health spending in improving the health outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using a surgery, such as 
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or photoselective vaporisation of 
the prostate using greenlight laser (GL-PVP), as initial treatment for men with 
moderate-to-severe benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) compared to the standard 
practice of using pharmacotherapy as initial treatment followed by surgery if 
symptoms do not resolve.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared a combination of eight strategies involving 
upfront pharmacotherapy (i.e., α-blocker, 5α-reductase inhibitor, or 
combination) followed by surgery (e.g. TURP or GL-PVP) upon failure vs TURP or 
GL-PVP as initial treatment, for a target population of men with 
moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms, with a mean age of 65 years and no 
contraindications for treatment. A microsimulation decision-analytic model was 
developed to project the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the 
target population over the lifetime. The model was populated and validated using 
published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
determined. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a public payer perspective, a 
lifetime horizon, a discount rate of 1.5%, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$50 000 (Canadian dollars)/QALY. Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: All options involving an upfront pharmacotherapy followed by TURP for 
those who fail were economically unattractive compared to strategies involving a 
GL-PVP for those who fail, and compared to using either BPH surgery as initial 
treatment. Overall, upfront TURP was the most costly and effective option, 
followed closely by upfront GL-PVP. On average, upfront TURP costs $1015 more 
and resulted in a small gain of 0.03 QALYs compared to upfront GL-PVP, 
translating to an incremental cost per QALY gained of $29 066. Results were 
robust to probabilistic analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is cost-effective as initial therapy for BPH. However, the 
health and economic evidence should be considered concurrently with patient 
preferences and risk attitudes towards different therapy options.

Demographic aging in Cuba, which has been occurring for over two decades, is 
undoubtedly an achievement of the countrys public health policies and social 
development. Although the State instituted a system of care aimed at 
guaranteeing elderly people favorable conditions for aging, the social 
achievement of greater longevity creates new challenges for social policy, 
infrastructure, healthcare systems and social inclusion. The Cuban population is 
diminishing and at the same time, life expectancy is increasing. These two 
conditions increase the proportion of people aged 60 and over, thus introducing 
a new scenario of an aging population. The present article analyzes some of the 
challenges that the Cuban State must face when developing policies that address 
and preserve the social achievement of a greater longevity, together with the 
conditions inherent in the development model that the country endorses.

Publisher: El envejecimiento demográfico en Cuba, visualizado desde hace más de 
dos décadas, es indudablemente una conquista de las políticas de salud pública y 
del desarrollo social del país. Aunque el Estado instituyó un sistema de 
atención encaminado a garantizar a sus personas mayores condiciones favorables 
para su envejecimiento, el logro social de una mayor longevidad establece nuevos 
retos en materia de políticas sociales, infraestructuras y servicios de atención 
e inclusión social hacia el colectivo de los mayores. La población cubana se 
caracteriza por el decrecimiento y altos índices de esperanza de vida, que 
incrementan la proporción de personas de 60 y más años, aspecto que introduce un 
nuevo escenario gerontológico. El presente artículo se propone analizar algunos 
desafíos hacia el Estado cubano para la conformación de políticas que 
posibiliten la continuidad del logro social de una mayor longevidad en 
correspondencia con las condiciones coherentes con el modelo de desarrollo que 
el país refrenda.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of 
cerebellar degenerative disorders, characterized by progressive gait 
unsteadiness, hand incoordination, and dysarthria. Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is 
caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the SCA1 gene resulting 
in the atypical extension of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the ataxin-1 
protein. Our main objective was to investigate the mitochondrial oxidative 
metabolism in the cerebellum of transgenic SCA1 mice. SCA1 transgenic mice 
develop clinical features in the early life stages (around 5 weeks of age) 
presenting pathological cerebellar signs with concomitant progressive Purkinje 
neuron atrophy and relatively little cell loss; this evidence suggests that the 
SCA1 phenotype is not the result of cell death per se, but a possible effect of 
cellular dysfunction that occurs before neuronal demise. We studied the 
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cerebellar cells from both homozygous and 
heterozygous transgenic SCA1 mice, aged 2 and 6 months. Histochemical 
examination showed a cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) deficiency in the Purkinje cells 
(PCs) of both heterozygous and homozygous mice, the oxidative defect being more 
prominent in older mice, in which the percentage of COX-deficient PC was up to 
30%. Using a laser-microdissector, we evaluated the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
content on selectively isolated COX-competent and COX-deficient PC by 
quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction and we found mtDNA depletion in those 
with oxidative dysfunction. In conclusion, the selective oxidative metabolism 
defect observed in neuronal PC expressing mutant ataxin occurs as early as 8 
weeks of age thus representing an early step in the PC degeneration process in 
SCA1 disease.

This study evaluated the effect of new motions of the motor TriAuto ZX2 on the 
cyclic fatigue of endodontic instruments. Vortex Blue 35.06 instruments were 
divided into four groups (n = 10) and tested for fatigue in a curved artificial 
canal (90° and 2 mm radius) using the following motions: continuous rotation 
(CR), Optimum Torque Reverse (OTR) set at 180° and the Optimum Glide Path (OGP), 
which was tested at 90° and 240°. The time to fracture (TTF) and the lengths of 
the fractured fragments were recorded. The mean TTF was significantly different 
among the groups (anova, P < 0.05): OGP 90° (213.39 ± 27.45), OTR 180° 
(121.24 ± 17.03), OGP 240° (45.24 ± 5.61) and CR (8.43 ± 1.27). Weibull analysis 
confirmed the shortest life expectancy for CR and the longest survival for OGP 
at 90°. The resistance to fatigue was affected by motions and pre-set angles. 
The proprietary movements that are currently available for endodontic 
instruments were classified according to their kinematics.

BACKGROUND: Afghanistan is one of the low-income countries in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region with young population and myriad of healthcare needs. We 
aim to report the burden of diseases and injuries in Afghanistan between 1990 
and 2016.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study for estimates of 
deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, years of 
life lived with disability, maternal mortality ratio (MMR), neonatal mortality 
rates (NMRs) and under 5 mortality rates (U5MR) in Afghanistan.
RESULTS: Total mortality rate, NMR and U5MR have progressively decreased between 
1990 and 2016. Mortality rate was 909.6 per 100000 (95% UI: 800.9-1023.3) and 
MMR was 442.8 (95% UI: 328.3-595.8) per 100000 live births in 2016. Conflict and 
terrorism, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and road injuries were the leading 
causes of DALY among males of all ages in 2016 with 10.9%, 7.8% and 7.6% of 
total DALYs respectively, whereas among females of all ages lower respiratory 
infections (LRIs), IHD and congenital birth defects were the leading causes of 
DALY with 8.7%, 7.0% and 6.5% of total DALYs respectively.
CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in certain health indicators, our study 
suggests an urgent intervention to improve health status of the country. Peace 
and safety by means of stopping the conflict and terrorism are the mainstay of 
all other health interventions. Improving health infrastructures, boosting 
maternal and child health (MCH), battling infectious diseases as well as chronic 
disease risk factor modification programs can help to decrease burden of 
diseases.

Established treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) include cognitive 
behaviour therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
medication. Combined treatment may outperform monotherapy, but few studies have 
investigated this. A total of 49 community-based adults with OCD were randomly 
assigned to CBT, SSRI, or SSRI+CBT. Sertraline (50-200 mg/day) was given as the 
SSRI for 52 weeks. A 16-h-manualized individual CBT was delivered over 8 weeks 
with four follow-up sessions. Assessors were 'blinded' to treatment allocation. 
A preliminary health economic evaluation was conducted. At week 16, combined 
treatment (n=13) was associated with the largest improvement, sertraline (n=7) 
the next largest and CBT (n=9) the smallest on the observed case analysis. The 
effect size (Cohen's d) comparing the improvement in Yale Brown Obsessive 
Compulsive Scale on CBT versus combined treatment was -0.39 and versus 
sertraline was -0.27. Between 16 and 52 weeks, the greatest clinical improvement 
was seen with sertraline, but participant discontinuation prevented reliable 
analysis. Compared with sertraline, the mean costs were higher for CBT and for 
combined treatment. The mean Quality Adjusted Life Year scores for sertraline 
were 0.1823 (95% confidence interval: 0.0447-0.3199) greater than for CBT and 
0.1135 (95% confidence interval: -0.0290-0.2560), greater than for combined 
treatment. Combined treatment appeared the most clinically effective option, 
especially over CBT, but the advantages over SSRI monotherapy were not sustained 
beyond 16 weeks. SSRI monotherapy was the most cost-effective. A definitive 
study can and should be conducted.

and Chao).

Preparing for a good death is an important and meaningful concept in Chinese 
culture because people hope to know residual life to make effort for their 
unfinished business. However, the family of terminally ill patients with cancer 
may be annoyed and frustrated about unexpected bereavement if they have 
unresolved conflicts with the loved one, missing a chance for declaring love, 
untimely apologizing and saying goodbye. The study aimed to explore this 
difficult issue. The medical records of 121 deceased terminally ill patients 
with cancer at National Cheng Kung University Hospital between December 2010 and 
February 2012 were reviewed. The signs and awareness of dying among these 
patients were collected using palliative routine instruments in the hospice 
ward. The top 3 most prevalent dying signs were coolness and cyanosis 
(prevalence 98.3%, median period from the first documented dying sign to death 2 
days, P = .028), mirror-like tongue (prevalence 94.2%, median period 5 days, P = 
.007), and earlobe crease (prevalence 93.4%, median period 4 days, P = .052). In 
addition, the prevalence of dying awareness was 71.1% (median period 4 days, P = 
.001). Furthermore, terminal agitation was identified more frequently in 
terminally ill patients with hepatoma and colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 
3.240, P = .043), but turbid sclera with edema was noted more often in 
terminally ill patients with head and neck cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 5.698, 
P = .042). The results provide evidence to support clinical practice, offering 
knowledge and techniques to health care providers, and increasing quality of 
life for terminally ill patients with cancer.

BACKGROUND: The Australian National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) was 
introduced in 2006. When fully implemented, the programme will invite people 
aged 50 to 74 to complete an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) 
every 2 years.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening occurring 
outside of the NBCSP, we classified participants (n = 2,480) in the Australasian 
Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) into 3 risk categories (average, 
moderately increased, and potentially high) based on CRC family history and 
assessed their screening practices according to national guidelines. We 
developed a microsimulation to compare hypothetical screening scenarios (70% and 
100% uptake) to current participation levels (baseline) and evaluated clinical 
outcomes and cost for each risk category. The 2 main limitations of this study 
are as follows: first, the fact that our cost-effectiveness analysis was 
performed from a third-party payer perspective, which does not include indirect 
costs and results in overestimated cost-effectiveness ratios, and second, that 
our natural history model of CRC does not include polyp sojourn time, which 
determines the rate of cancerous transformation. Screening uptake was low across 
all family history risk categories (64%-56% reported no screening). For 
participants at average risk, 18% reported overscreening, while 37% of those in 
the highest risk categories screened according to guidelines. Higher screening 
levels would substantially reduce CRC mortality across all risk categories (95 
to 305 fewer deaths per 100,000 persons in the 70% scenario versus baseline). 
For those at average risk, a fully implemented NBCSP represented the most 
cost-effective approach to prevent CRC deaths (AUS$13,000-16,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). For those at moderately increased risk, 
higher adherence to recommended screening was also highly cost-effective 
(AUS$19,000-24,000 per QALY).
CONCLUSION: Investing in public health strategies to increase adherence to 
appropriate CRC screening will save lives and deliver high value for money.

BACKGROUND: Use of everolimus-eluting stents (EES) has proven to be clinically 
effective and safe in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 
but it remains unclear whether it is cost-effective compared to bare-metal 
stents (BMS) in the long-term. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of EES 
versus BMS based on the 5-year results of the EXAMINATION trial, from a Spanish 
health service perspective.
METHODS: Decision analysis of the use of EES versus BMS was based on the 
patient-level clinical outcome data of the EXAMINATION trial. The analysis 
adopted a lifelong time horizon, assuming that long-term survival was 
independent of the initial treatment strategy after the end of follow-up. 
Life-expectancy, health-state utility scores and unit costs were extracted from 
published literature and publicly available sources. Non-parametric 
bootstrapping was combined with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to co-assess 
the impact of patient-level variation and parameter uncertainty. The main 
outcomes were total costs and quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-years 
gained. Costs and effects were discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: The model predicted an average survival time in patients receiving EES 
and BMS of 10.52 and 10.38 undiscounted years, respectively. Over the life-long 
time horizon, the EES strategy was €430 more costly than BMS (€8,305 vs. 
€7,874), but went along with incremental gains of 0.10 quality-adjusted 
life-years. This resulted in an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
over all simulations of €3,948 per quality-adjusted life-years gained and was 
below a willingness-to-pay threshold of €25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years 
gained in 86.9% of simulation runs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher total costs relative to BMS, EES appeared to be a 
cost-effective therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients 
due to their incremental effectiveness. Predicted incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were below generally acceptable threshold values.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and lethal primary astrocytic tumors of 
the central nervous system. They account for 60% to 70% of all gliomas and the 
majority are diagnosed in Caucasian male patients at advanced age. Genetic 
analyses of glioblastoma show a great intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, 
which opens up a debate about its cellular origin. Different types of brain 
cells, including astrocytes, neural stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells 
and glioblastoma stem cells are proposed to have a role in tumor initiation and 
spreading; however, data is still inconclusive. Due to short life expectancy, 
long-term glioblastoma survivors are defined as patients who live longer than 
two years post-diagnosis. Extreme survivors, living 10 years or more after 
diagnosis, comprise less than 1% of all patients. Molecular testing indicates 
genetic differences between short- and long-term survivors with glioblastoma. 
The most informative are IDH1/2 gene mutations and MGMT promoter methylation, 
which are associated with a better response to standard clinical care. Moreover, 
a decreased expression of the CHI3L1, FBLN4, EMP3, IGFBP2, IGFBP3, LGALS3, MAOB, 
PDPN, SERPING1 and TIMP1 genes has been associated with prolonged survival. In 
addition, emerging evidence suggests the role of different microRNAs in 
predicting patient survival. Other factors that may affect the survival of 
glioblastoma patients include clinical/demographic characteristics such as 
seizures at presentation, age at diagnosis, and the extent of surgical 
resection. Because of the small number of long-term survivors with glioblastoma, 
comparative studies on genetic differences between short- and long-term 
survivors are challenging. To improve patient management and clinical outcomes, 
a thorough "omics" approach is necessary for identifying differences between 
short- and long-term survivors with glioblastoma.

AIMS: The clinical and economic impact of diabetes is growing in the US. 
Choosing therapies that are both effective and cost-effective is becoming 
increasingly important. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira for treatment of patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin, vs insulin 
glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, in the US setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Long-term projections of cost-effectiveness outcomes were 
made using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical inputs were based on the DUAL 
VII trial, with costs (accounted from a healthcare payer perspective) and 
utilities based on published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were 
discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with increased discounted life expectancy by 
0.02 years and increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.22 
quality-adjusted life years compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin 
aspart. Evaluation of direct medical costs suggested that the mean cost per 
patient with IDegLira was $3,571 lower than with insulin glargine U100 plus 
insulin aspart. The cost saving was driven predominantly by the lower 
acquisition cost of IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin 
aspart, with further cost savings identified as a result of avoided treatment of 
diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with improved clinical 
outcomes at a reduced cost compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin 
aspart.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinical trial data, the present analysis suggests that 
IDegLira is associated with improved clinical outcomes and cost savings compared 
with treatment with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for patients with 
type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US. 
Therefore, IDegLira is likely to be considered dominant (cost saving and more 
effective) and, consequently, highly cost-effective in the US setting.

BACKGROUND: Ageing, socioeconomic level, obesity, fertility, relaxed natural 
selection and urbanization have been postulated as the risk factors of ovarian 
cancer (OC56). We sought to identify which factor plays the most significant 
role in predicting OC56 incidence rate worldwide.
METHODS: Bivariate correlation analysis was performed to assess the 
relationships between country-specific estimates of ageing (measured by life 
expectancy), GDP PPP (Purchasing power parity), obesity prevalence, fertility 
(indexed by the crude birth rate), opportunity for natural selection (Ibs) and 
urbanization. Partial correlation was used to compare contribution of different 
variables. Fisher A-to-Z was used to compare the correlation coefficients. 
Multiple linear regression (Enter and Stepwise) was conducted to identify 
significant determinants of OC56 incidence. ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni 
analysis was performed to compare differences between the means of OC56 
incidence rate and residuals of OC56 standardised on fertility and GDP 
respectively between the six WHO regions.
RESULTS: Bivariate analyses revealed that OC56 was significantly and strongly 
correlated to ageing, GDP, obesity, low fertility, Ibs and urbanization. 
However, partial correlation analysis identified that fertility and ageing were 
the only variables that had a significant correlation to OC56 incidence when the 
other five variables were kept statistically constant. Fisher A-to-Z revealed 
that OC56 had a significantly stronger correlation to low fertility than to 
ageing. Stepwise linear regression analysis only identified fertility as the 
significant predictor of OC56. ANOVA showed that, between the six WHO regions, 
multiple mean differences of OC56 incidence were significant, but all 
disappeared when the contributing effect of fertility on OC56 incidence rate was 
removed.
CONCLUSIONS: Low fertility may be the most significant determining predictor of 
OC56 incidence worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Partial factorial trials compare two or more pairs of treatments on 
overlapping patient groups, randomising some (but not all) patients to more than 
one comparison. The aims of this research were to compare different methods for 
conducting and analysing economic evaluations on partial factorial trials and 
assess the implications of considering factors simultaneously rather than 
drawing independent conclusions about each comparison.
METHODS: We estimated total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) within 
10 years of surgery for 2252 patients in the Knee Arthroplasty Trial who were 
randomised to one or more comparisons of different surgical types. We compared 
three analytical methods: an "at-the-margins" analysis including all patients 
randomised to each comparison (assuming no interaction); an "inside-the-table" 
analysis that included interactions but focused on those patients randomised to 
two comparisons; and a Bayesian vetted bootstrap, which used results from 
patients randomised to one comparison as priors when estimating outcomes for 
patients randomised to two comparisons. Outcomes comprised incremental costs, 
QALYs and net benefits.
RESULTS: Qualitative interactions were observed for costs, QALYs and net 
benefits. Bayesian bootstrapping generally produced smaller standard errors than 
inside-the-table analysis and gave conclusions that were consistent with 
at-the-margins analysis, while allowing for these interactions. By contrast, 
inside-the-table gave different conclusions about which intervention had the 
highest net benefits compared with other analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: All analyses of partial factorial trials should explore 
interactions and assess whether results are sensitive to assumptions about 
interactions, either as a primary analysis or as a sensitivity analysis. For 
partial factorial trials closely mirroring routine clinical practice, 
at-the-margins analysis may provide a reasonable estimate of average costs and 
benefits for the whole trial population, even in the presence of interactions. 
However, such conclusions will be misleading if there are large interactions or 
if the proportion of patients allocated to different treatments differs markedly 
from what occurs in clinical practice. The Bayesian bootstrap provides an 
alternative to at-the-margins analysis for analysing clinical or economic 
endpoints from partial factorial trials, which allows for interactions while 
making use of the whole sample. The same techniques could be applied to analyses 
of clinical endpoints.

In Spain, HIV incidence has remained stable and higher than the European average 
since 2000 due to insuf-ficient prevention measures. An estimated 
130,000-160,000 people are believed to be living with HIV in Spain, including 
18% who do not know they are infected, and half are late diagnoses, with a 
poorer clinical course, lower quality of life and life expectancy, as well as 
higher costs. Late diagnosis is more common in heterosexuals, intravenous drug 
users, people over 50 years of age and immigrants, whereas men who have sex with 
men are the only group where the rate of new diagnoses is increasing. An 
estimated 34% of people with HIV have a detectable viral load, mainly due to 
barriers that hinder diagnosis such as insufficient testing availability and the 
low risk perception of undiagnosed individuals and healthcare professionals.

There has been a significant change in the clinical characteristics of people 
living with HIV, with new needs arising that must be tackled. The life 
expectancy of a subject diagnosed early with HIV infection and recei-ving 
suppressive antiretroviral therapy is currently on a par with the life
