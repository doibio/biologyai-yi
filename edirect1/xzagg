RESULTS: Overweight men and women lost 270,000 and 1.8 million quality-adjusted 
life years, respectively, relative to their normal-weight counterparts. Obese 
men and women lost 1.9 million and 3.4 million quality-adjusted life years, 
respectively, per year. Much of the burden of disease among overweight and obese 
women arose from lower health-related quality of life and late life mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to men, women suffer a disproportionate burden of disease 
attributable to overweight and obesity, mostly because of differences in 
health-related quality of life.

Nasal polyps concern about 1-4% population however the cause of disease does not 
be well-known. With this reason there have not causal treatment of the disease. 
The aim of nasal polyps treatment is as follows: removal or decrease the polyps' 
mass, improvement of patency of the nose, improvement of smell, opening the 
passage of paranasal sinuses, decrease the inflammatory discharge from the 
paranasal sinuses, prevention the recurrences the disease as well as improvement 
of quality of life. In the treatment of nasal polyps surgery, pharmacological 
treatment and combined both these methods were performed. The surgical treatment 
is not only removal of nasal polyps, but also to try to correct anatomical 
abnormalities. The introduction of endoscopic surgery, computer assisted 
navigation and microdebriders made possible to very precise surgical management 
of the nose and paranasal sinuses and decrease the number of complications. 
Surgery treatment of the nasal polyps is necessary in every suspicious about 
neoplasmic change case because material lets us to histopathologic examination. 
Pharmacological treatment of nasal polyps contains many groups of medicines. 
These medicines show anti-inflammatory and anti-swelling effects. 
Pharmacological treatment of nasal polyps can be conducted as a primary 
procedure and more often as a post surgery treatment. The following groups of 
medicines are used in pharmacological treatment of nasal polyps: 
glucocorticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungal, anti-leukotrienes, capsaicin, 
antihistaminic, lysine of acetylsalicylic acid, furosemid and antibody against 
IL-5. The use of glucorticosteroids in long treatment after surgical operation 
increased the time of remission of disease. Also in well-chosen cases use of 
another medicines permits on extension the time of remission and decrease a dose 
of used glucocorticosteroids.

[Analysis of the incidence and survival of female breast cancer in Beijing 
during the last 20 years].

[Article in Chinese]

Clinical Oncology, Peking University, Beijing 100034, China.

OBJECTIVE: To provide scientific evidence for breast cancer prevention and 
control through epidemiological analysis of the incidence, mortality and 
survival rate of female breast cancer in Beijing.
METHODS: The registration data of females in Beijing urban area from 1982 to 
2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence, mortality and survival rate 
of female breast cancer were analyzed using routine and life table statistical 
methods.
RESULTS: There was a trend of annual increase by an average of 4.6% and 4.9% in 
the Beijing urban incidence and world population standardized incidence of 
female breast cancer during the period of 1982 to 2001. The epidemiological 
features of Beijing urban female breast cancer showed: (1) The incidence curve 
of different age groups from 25 to 80 years elevated with two peaks at age of 
>or= 45 and >or= 70 years; (2) There was an elevation in each age group during 
the last 20 years; (3) The interception rate at age of 35 to 64 reached 
95.3/100,000 population, which made the breast cancer become the number one 
cancer in female. The changes of survival rate showed: the 5-year observed 
survival rate (OSR) increased from 62.0% in 1982 - 1983 to 68.7% in 1987 - 1988, 
the relative survival rate (RSR) increased from 66.3% to 74.2%. The OSR and RSR 
in 1987 - 1988 were 60.3% and 65.1% at 10 years, and 57.7% and 61.3% 15 years, 
respectively. The mortality rate of breast cancer fluctuated at 8 to 10 per 
10(5) population during the last 20 years.
CONCLUSION: There is a trend of an annual increase in female breast cancer in 
Beijing. The 5-year survival is being improved gradually while the mortality 
rate remains stable. The results demonstrate that the "early prevention, early 
diagnosis and early treatment" principles for breast cancer is effective in 
Beijing.

Trends in life expectancy after spinal cord injury.

Strauss DJ(1), Devivo MJ, Paculdo DR, Shavelle RM.

strauss@LifeExpectancy.com

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there have been improvements in survival after 
spinal cord injury (SCI) over time, both in the critical first 2 years after 
injury and in the longer term.
DESIGN: Pooled repeated observations analysis of person-years. For each 
person-year, the outcome variable is survival and mortality, and the explanatory 
variables include age, level and grade of injury, and calendar year (the main 
focus of the analyses). The method can be viewed as a generalization of 
proportional hazards regression.
SETTING: Model spinal cord injury systems and hospital SCI units across the 
United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons (N=30,822) admitted to a Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems 
facility a minimum of 1 day after injury. Only persons over 10 years of age and 
known not to be ventilator dependent were included. These persons contributed 
323,618 person-years of data, with 4980 deaths, over the 1973 to 2004 study 
period.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival.
RESULTS: Other factors being equal, over the last 3 decades there has been a 40% 
decline in mortality during the critical first 2 years after injury. However, 
the decline in mortality over time in the post-2-year period is small and not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a substantial decline in mortality after the first 2 
years postinjury is contrary to widely held impressions. Nevertheless, the 
finding is based on a large database and sensitive analytic methods and is 
consistent with previous research. Improvements in critical care medicine after 
spinal cord injury may explain the marked decline in short-term mortality. In 
contrast, although there have no doubt been improvements in long-term 
rehabilitative care, their effect in enhancing the life span of persons with SCI 
appears to have been overstated.

Author information:
(1)Hamilton Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Tennessee 
Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.

PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes after implantation of the 
silicone plate and the polypropylene plate Ahmed Glaucoma Valves.
DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, comparative series.
METHODS: A total of 132 patients with uncontrolled glaucoma were treated with 
either the silicone or polypropylene Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success was defined according to 2 criteria: (1) 
intraocular pressure (IOP) of 6 mmHg or more or 21 mmHg or less, and (2) IOP 
reduction of at least 30% relative to preoperative values. Eyes requiring 
further glaucoma surgery, including cyclophotocoagulation, or showing loss of 
light perception were classified as failures.
RESULTS: Average follow-up was 12.8 months (range, 6-30 months) for the silicone 
plate group and 14.5 months (range, 6-30 months) for the polypropylene plate 
group (P = 0.063). At the last follow-up examination, the mean IOP was 
13.8+/-3.9 mmHg and 17.3+/-6.5 mmHg (P<0.0001) and the mean number of 
antiglaucoma medications was 1.9+/-1.3 and 2.1+/-1.4 (P = 0.48) in the silicone 
plate and polypropylene plate groups, respectively. The life-table success rates 
for the silicone plate and polypropylene plate groups were 94.2% and 83.2% at 12 
months and 82.4% and 56.7% at 24 months by definition 1, respectively (P = 
0.035). When an IOP reduction of at least 30% was used for success criterion 
(definition 2), probabilities of success were 89.5% and 71.7% at 12 months and 
78.3% and 68.5% at 24 months in the silicone and the polypropylene plate groups, 
respectively (P = 0.012). Visual outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups. 
However, complications including Tenon's cyst were observed more frequently in 
the polypropylene plate than in the silicone plate group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The silicone Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (model FP7) showed improved IOP 
reduction compared with the polypropylene (model S2) implant. Differences 
observed in mean IOP, success rate, and complications suggest that plate 
material may influence clinical outcome.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of core decompression.

California 90095, USA.

Core decompression is widely used to treat the early stages of osteonecrosis of 
the hip. The purpose of this analysis is to assist orthopedic surgeons in 
judging whether currently available data support the use of core decompression 
as cost-effective. A decision model was created for the treatment of 
osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Literature review was used to identify 
possible outcomes and their probability after initial treatment with either 
observation or core decompression. This model demonstrates core decompression 
must delay the need for total hip arthroplasty for a minimum of 5 years to 
maintain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio lower than 50,000 dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year gained. Treatment options with ratios higher than 
50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year are generally considered to have 
limited cost-effectiveness. This study demonstrates that core decompression has 
the potential to be a highly cost-effective alternative if it is leads to a 
delay in the need for total hip arthroplasty of 5 years or longer.

Health and religiosity among Israeli Jews.

Shmueli A(1).

Author information:

Management, Jerusalem, Israel. ashmueli@md2.huji.ac.il

BACKGROUND: The objective of this paper is to explore the connection between 
self-reported health and religiosity among Israeli Jews, using several 
self-reported health measures.
METHODS: Data were collected by two health surveys covering 1999 individuals in 
1993 and 2505 individuals in 2000, representing the population of Jewish 
Israelis aged 45-75 years residing in urban communities in those years. 
Self-reported health was measured by (i) reported chronic conditions, (ii) the 
SF-36 instrument, and (iii) a visual analogue scale of health-related quality of 
life. Religiosity was measured by a self-reported five-category scale.
RESULTS: Controlling for a large array of socio-demographic characteristics, 
while no religiosity gradient was found in reported chronic morbidity, religious 
persons generally report worse health than secular persons on the other 
measures. The gap is larger in the SF-36's role-performance scales, and among 
women and Israelis from Asian-African origin.
DISCUSSION: The mixed results are consistent with the ambiguity of the 
religiosity effect on health reported in recent surveys. However, trying to 
reconcile between longer life expectancy of religious persons found in earlier 
Israeli and other research and poorer reported health found above, the paper 
emphasizes the possible differences in the perception of 'normal' life and 
roles, and argues that the SF-36 health measures might suffer from a 
religiosity-related reporting heterogeneity, distorting their association with 
mortality in the population.

Calculating QALYs, comparing QALY and DALY calculations.

Sassi F(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Social Policy, The London School of Economics and Political 
Science, London, UK. f.sassi@lse.ac.uk

Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) have been used in the assessment of health 
interventions for three decades. The popularity of the QALY approach has been 
constantly increasing, although the debate on its theoretical underpinnings and 
practical implications is still ongoing. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
also widely debated, were shaped some 20 years later, broadly within the same 
conceptual framework but with a number of important differences. This paper 
provides a comprehensive formulation of QALY calculation methods, offering 
practical instruments for assessing the impact of health interventions, similar 
to those made available elsewhere for calculating DALYs. Systematic differences 
between QALYs and DALYs are explained by reference to two examples: the 
prevention of tuberculosis and the treatment of bipolar depression. When a 
health intervention is aimed at preventing or treating a non-fatal disease, the 
relationship between QALYs gained and DALYs saved depends on age of onset and 
duration of the disease, as well as the quality of life and disability weights. 
In the case of a potentially fatal disease, a larger number of factors may 
determine differences between outcomes assessed with the two metrics. The 
relative importance of some of these factors is discussed and illustrated 
graphically in the paper. Understanding similarities and differences between 
QALYs and DALYs is important to researchers and policy makers, for a sound 
interpretation of the evidence on the outcomes of health interventions.

Regression analysis of mean quality-adjusted lifetime with censored data.

Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA. 
hkwang@virginia.edu

In clinical trials of chronic diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome, cancer, or cardiovascular diseases, the concept of quality-adjusted 
lifetime (QAL) has received more and more attention. In this paper, we consider 
the problem of how the covariates affect the mean QAL when the data are subject 
to right censoring. We allow a very general form for the mean model as a 
function of covariates. Using the idea of inverse probability weighting, we 
first construct a simple weighted estimating equation for the parameters in our 
mean model. We then find the form of the most efficient estimating equation, 
which yields the most efficient estimator for the regression parameters. Since 
the most efficient estimator depends on the distribution of the health history 
processes, and thus cannot be estimated nonparametrically, we consider different 
approaches for improving the efficiency of the simple weighted estimating 
equation using observed data. The applicability of these methods is demonstrated 
by both simulation experiments and a data example from a breast cancer clinical 
trial study.

Comment in
    J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 1;24(22):3524-6.

PURPOSE: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to provide 
survival benefit in patients with limited disease small-cell lung cancer 
(LD-SCLC) who have achieved complete response. However, PCI may also produce 
long-term neurotoxicity (NT). The benefits and risks of PCI in LD-SCLC are 
evaluated.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) in a cohort of SCLC patients who do or do not receive PCI by 
varying survival rates and the frequency and severity of PCI-related NT. 
Sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the optimal 
decision.
RESULTS: At current published survival rates (26% 5-year survival rate with PCI 
and 22% without PCI) and a low NT rate, PCI offered a benefit over no PCI (QALE 
= 4.31 and 3.70 for mild NT severity; QALE = 4.09 and 3.70 for substantial NT 
severity, respectively). With a moderate NT rate, PCI was still preferred. If 
the PCI survival rate increased to 40%, PCI outperformed no PCI with a mild NT 
severity. However, no PCI was preferred over PCI (QALE = 5.72 v 5.47) with 
substantial NT severity. Two-way sensitivity analyses showed that PCI was 
preferred for low NT rates, mild NT severity, and low long-term survival rates. 
Otherwise, no PCI was preferred.
CONCLUSION: The current data suggest PCI offers better QALE than no PCI in 
LD-SCLC patients who have achieved complete response. As the survival rate for 
SCLC patients continues to improve, NT rate and NT severity must be controlled 
to maintain a favorable benefit-risk ratio for recommending PCI.

weisbrot@cepr.net

This article looks at the available data on economic growth and various social 
indicators-including health outcomes and education-and compares the past 25 
years (1980-2005 or latest available year) with the prior two decades 
(1960-1980). The past 25 years have seen a sharp slowdown in the rate of 
economic growth for the vast majority of low- and middle-income countries. For 
the health indicators, there is a marked decrease in progress for life 
expectancy and for infant, child, and adult mortalities. For education, there is 
a reduction in progress in secondary school enrollment and in public spending on 
education, and reduced progress in primary school enrollment for the bottom two 
quintiles of countries. The results are discussed in the context of a number of 
economic reforms implemented over the past 25 years, with the intention of 
promoting growth and development. The authors conclude that economists and 
policymakers should devote more effort to determining the causes of the economic 
and development failure of the last quarter-century.

Improving the health of Indigenous Australians: reforms in nursing education. An 
opinion piece of international interest.

AIM: This paper overviews Indigenous disadvantage in relatively wealthy 
Australia. It describes efforts to increase the recruitment and retention of 
Indigenous people in nursing and to reform nursing education to be more 
inclusive of Indigenous culture, health and history.
BACKGROUND: Indigenous people on average die 17 years younger than 
non-Indigenous people and have health problems similar to those of people in 
some underdeveloped countries. Moreover, social injustice and human rights 
issues affect their health and well-being and educational opportunities. They 
are under-represented in the health professions, including nursing, often 
through a lack of educational preparation and historical, socio-economic and 
cultural factors hindering them from entering and succeeding in university 
studies.
METHODS: In 2000, a project was funded by the Australian commonwealth government 
and led by the Indigenous Nursing Education Working Group. This Group worked for 
five years on a wide range of methods that included consultation within the 
profession, information dissemination and longitudinal surveying of university 
schools of nursing and Indigenous support units.
RESULTS: Findings show that collaborative efforts between key stakeholders in 
nursing education appear to be succeeding to increase the numbers of Indigenous 
students of nursing. Around two-thirds of schools of nursing now include 
Indigenous content in their undergraduate curricula, but the majority is yet to 
provide Indigenous cultural awareness/cultural safety training for faculty.

Author information:

Manchester, UK. H.jones@mmu.ac.uk

AIM: This paper seeks to offer further analysis on the relationship between 
abuse of power, elder abuse and sexual violence. Importantly, current 
definitions are examined and the existing literature is reviewed to establish 
what the current level of debate is on sexual violence in its relationship to 
elderly women.
METHODS: Through the analysis of available literature it is possible to observe 
which and how older people have been marginalized both in particular disciplines 
of study and policy spaces.
FINDINGS: We conclude that marginalization results in inadequate redress to 
issues of violence and power that may manifest against the older person, and 
which leads to feelings of vulnerability. There are important implications for 
helping health professionals, especially nurses, for understanding the policy, 
theory and practice. The need for empirical research in this difficult area is 
paramount.

The obesity epidemic in the United States is a major health problem, which poses 
im-mediate and long-term health risks with potential for significant reduction 
in life expectancy if not curtailed. Despite affecting all segments of the 
population, minorities carry a relatively larger burden of the obesity threat. 
Obesity is a major risk factor for develop-ing obstructive sleep apnea and the 
metabolic syndrome, which are associated with increased cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. This article discusses the implications 
of the obesity trend on the prevalence of obstructive sleep ap-nea and health, 
highlights ethnic differences, reviews the resultant economic implications, and 
suggests public health and health policy initiatives that may be beneficial in 
stemming the obesity scourge.

In order to control any pest it is essential to study the life cycle, biology 
and bionomics of the target pest under control. With this respect, we have 
studied the flight range of the house fly Musca domestica (L.). The flight range 
of the house fly from two sites i.e, the poultry farm and a stable farm has been 
studied. The flight range study was conducted using a mark release technique. 
The approach we used in this study was that the flies collected from the 
respective farms were marked and released at different distances from the farms. 
The flies were then re-captured from the poultry farm and the stable farm. 
Studies conducted elsewhere use the technique of releasing the insect species at 
one spot and recapturing the insect species with the help of baited traps placed 
at various locations from the release point. The advantage of the approach used 
in this study was that the flight range as well as the homing effect was 
determined. From this study, the flight range of house flies released at the 
poultry farm was 7 km whereas flight range for flies release from stable farm 
was 5 km. The recovery rate of house flies at the poultry and stable farm was 
0.05% and 0.016%, In this study, marked specimens has been detected up to 8 days 
in field conditions indicating that under field condition the life expectancy 
could be in the range of 1-2 weeks.

OBJECTIVE: Panel interview surveys of nationally representative elderly people 
aged 65 years or above in Japan were conducted three times at 2-year intervals 
since 1999 (Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging) to estimate 
health expectancy for males and females separately according to their chewing 
ability.
METHOD: Multistate life table methods were applied to estimate health 
expectancy. Three health states, namely, active, inactive and dead, were defined 
according to the ability to perform specified daily activities. Living 
respondents were considered to be in an "inactive state" if they responded "very 
difficult" or "unable" for performance of at least one ADL or IADL. Otherwise 
they were considered to be in an "active state". 4,323 sampled persons who 
responded to the baseline survey were included in the study. Based on estimated 
transition probabilities over the survey period between active and inactive 
states, and active and inactive states to death, both population- and 
status-based multistate life tables were constructed according to chewing 
ability. Those who could chew relatively hard foods at the baseline survey were 
classified as Group A and those who could chew only relatively soft foods were 
classified as Group B.
RESULTS: The population-based multistate life tables indicated that at age 65, 
total life expectancy was 19.3/23.2 (males/females) years for Group A and 
16.7/21.1 years for Group B. Active life expectancy was 16.8/18.6 years and 
13.6/16.3 years, and inactive life expectancy was 2.4/4.6 years and 3.1/4.8 
years for Groups A and B respectively. A statistically significant difference 
was observed between the two groups only in terms of active life expectancy. 
From status-based multistate life tables, similar patterns were observed for 
those whose status at the baseline was "active".
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that maintenance or recovery of sufficient 
chewing ability for elderly people is related to a longer total life expectancy 
and even more strongly related to a longer active life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is a complex 
congenital cardiovascular anomaly that frequently requires single ventricle 
palliation. Fetal diagnosis of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum 
is common, but the natural history of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular 
septum diagnosed in midgestation, predictors of neonatal anatomy, and predictors 
of biventricular repair have not been determined. The objective of this study 
was to determine whether the size and rate of growth of the fetal tricuspid 
valve predict neonatal anatomy and biventricular repair.
DESIGN AND RESULTS: Twenty-three fetuses diagnosed with pulmonary atresia with 
intact ventricular septum between 1990 and 2004 were studied. Of 13 fetuses with 
a midgestation fetal tricuspid valve z score < or = -3, 1 achieved biventricular 
repair, compared with 5 of 5 with a tricuspid valve z score > -3. Of 13 fetuses 
with a midgestation fetal tricuspid valve z score < or = -3, 8 were diagnosed 
postnatally with a right ventricular dependent coronary circulation, compared 
with none with a tricuspid valve z score > -3. Midgestation and late gestation 
fetal tricuspid valve z scores correlated with neonatal tricuspid valve z score. 
The average rate of tricuspid valve growth between mid- and late fetal 
echocardiograms was significantly lower in patients who did not achieve 
biventricular repair than in those who did (0.012 +/- 0.008 cm per week vs 0.028 
+/- 0.014 cm per week).
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal tricuspid valve z score and rate of growth predict postnatal 
outcome in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. These findings may 
have important implications for prenatal counseling and selection of patients 
for fetal pulmonary valve dilation.

Screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic children with Down syndrome: 
cost-effectiveness of preventing lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrate an increased prevalence of celiac disease in 
persons with Down syndrome, leading some organizations and authors to recommend 
universal screening of children with Down syndrome. However, many children with 
Down syndrome are asymptomatic, and the long-term implications of screening are 
unknown. The complication of celiac disease that leads to mortality in the 
general population is non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research in asymptomatic children with Down 
syndrome was to (1) calculate the number needed to screen to prevent a single 
case of lymphoma and (2) present a cost-effectiveness study of screening.
METHODS: We constructed a decision tree using probabilities derived from the 
published literature for Down syndrome or from the general population where Down 
syndrome-specific data were not available. Celiac disease was determined by 
serologic screening and confirmation with intestinal biopsy. Sensitivity 
analysis was used to alter probability estimates affecting the cost of 
preventing lymphoma.
RESULTS: Using our baseline values, the no-screen strategy is dominant; that is, 
screening not only costs more but also results in fewer quality-adjusted 
life-years. A screening strategy costs more than $500,000 per life-year gained. 
Screening all asymptomatic children with Down syndrome for celiac disease costs 
almost $5 million to prevent a single case of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION: These analyses do not support the cost-effectiveness of screening, 
and more data are needed before recommendations to screen asymptomatic children 
with Down syndrome for celiac disease can be made.

BACKGROUND: It is known that extremely premature infants do less well than more 
mature infants, and this fact has led some countries to adopt a "cutoff for 
viability" using birth weight or gestation. Infants affected by intrauterine 
growth retardation are at additional risk of poor outcome. There are few data to 
inform decisions about viability and (dis)continuation of intensive care when 
both extreme prematurity and severe growth retardation are present.
OBJECTIVE: We focused on (1) premature infants affected by marked intrauterine 
growth retardation to determine if there was a cutoff weight centile below which 
the mortality sharply increased and (2) the short-term outcome of extremely 
premature and growth-retarded infants to determine a cutoff for viability.
METHODS: We evaluated preterm infants of 22-32 weeks' gestation if they were 
alive at the onset of labor and born to European mothers resident in the Trent 
(United Kingdom) health region between 1994 and 2003. Infants were categorized 
into 6 weight centiles, and infants in each category were assessed for survival 
to discharge from the neonatal unit, duration of respiratory support, length of 
stay in the neonatal unit, and the age at death in nonsurvivors.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 8228 infants who met the study criteria. Of 
these, 4448 infants were male, 6194 were from singleton pregnancies, and 2887 
were born at < or = 28 completed weeks of gestation. Survival to discharge was 
markedly reduced in the infants born at < or = 28 weeks of gestation with a 
birth weight less than the 2nd centile. Stillbirth was inversely related to 
birth weight centile in infants born before 29 weeks of gestation.
CONCLUSIONS: The survival for infants born at < or = 28 weeks' gestation and 
having a birth weight in less than the 2nd centile is poor, and consideration 
should be given to modifying their management.

Since 1995, the Baylor Group has been developing a totally implantable NEDO BVAD 
system. This 10-year program was completed in March 2005, and preparation for 
clinical trials is underway. This article summarizes the entire 10-year NEDO 
program and describes the strategy for clinical trials. The project aimed to 
achieve: (1) dual centrifugal pumps with the ability of full biventricular 
support, (2) a compact system implantable into small adults, (3) a totally 
implantable system with transcutaneous energy transmission system (TETS), (4) a 
durable system with a lifetime of over 5 years, and (5) a system free of 
thrombus and with minimal hemolysis. The final goals are to complete preclinical 
system evaluations and commence the clinical trials in the near future. In vitro 
studies have demonstrated a pump capacity of over 8.5 l/min and an Index of 
Hemolysis of <0.004 g/100 l. The pump-bearing life expectancy was over 5 years. 
To date, eight pumps endured in vivo studies of over 3 months without 
complications, including thromboembolic events. The in vitro endurance studies 
of eight pumps are longer than 1 year. There were no mechanical malfunctions or 
pump failure. A stepwise clinical trial is being planned: Step1, a wearable 
BVAD/VAD will be clinically studied; Step 2, the BVAD/VAD will be implanted 
intracorporeally without TETS; and, Step 3, a totally implantable system will be 
clinically evaluated. The NEDO BVAD system has completed preclinical testing. 
Clinical trial preparation is underway.

Australia.

Iron overload disorders represent a heterogenous group of conditions resulting 
from inherited and acquired causes. If undiagnosed they can be progressive and 
fatal. Early detection and phlebotomy prior to the onset of cirrhosis can reduce 
morbidity and normalise life expectancy. We now have greater insight into the 
complex mechanisms of normal and disordered iron homeostasis following the 
discovery of new proteins and genetic defects. Here we review the normal 
mechanisms and regulation of gastrointestinal iron absorption and liver iron 
transport and their dysregulation in iron overload states. Advances in the 
understanding of the natural history of iron overload disorders and new methods 
for clinical detection and management of hereditary haemochromatosis are also 
reviewed. The current screening strategies target high-risk groups such as 
first-degree relatives of affected individuals and those with clinical features 
suggestive of iron loading. Potential ethical, legal and psychosocial issues 
arising through application of genetic screening programs need to be resolved 
prior to implementation of general population screening programs.

Role of surgery in treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.

The proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at localized stages increased from 
56.7% to 74. 0% between 1973 and 1993 ("stage migration"). A corresponding 
increase in the number of radical prostatectomies performed each year was also 
noted. Nomograms are mathematical algorithms derived from statistical models 
that are used to predict outcomes for an individual patient, or for groups of 
patients. In fact, careful pre-operative patient and tumor selection before 
radical prostatectomy is mandatory. Locally advanced prostate cancer is defined 
as tumor that has extended clinically beyond the prostatic capsule, with 
invasion of the pericapsular tissue, apex, bladder neck or seminal vescicle, but 
without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. It is estimated that 
12-15% of prostate cancer are stage T3. Overstaging or understaging of this 
cancer is common. Correct staging of clinical T3 disease is even more difficult 
and both overstaging pT2 and understaging pT4 or pN+ are common. The goals of 
treatment for T3 tumors are to cure the disease, prolong survival or 
metastasis-free survival and improve the quality of life. The authors reviewed 
the most important studies, investigated radical prostatectomy as monotherapy 
for locally advanced prostate cancer and the integration of surgery with 
hormonal treatment. The EAU guidelines on prostate cancer state that radical 
prostatectomy in locally advanced disease is an option for selected patients 
with small T3, PSA <20 ng/ml, Gleason score <8 and a life expectancy > 10 years. 
Ten to 15% of clinical T3 are overstaged as pT2. This may lead to the 
possibility of curing these patients with surgery as the monotherapy. The 
increased use of nomograms and increased knowledge of recognized prognostic 
factors could lead to the selection of a large number of patients, often with a 
long life expectancy, who could benefit from surgical treatment.

Older adults' attitudes about continuing cancer screening later in life: a pilot 
study interviewing residents of two continuing care communities.

North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill, NC, USA. Carmen_Lewis@med.unc.edu

BACKGROUND: Individualized decision making has been recommended for cancer 
screening decisions in older adults. Because older adults' preferences are 
central to individualized decisions, we assessed older adults' perspectives 
about continuing cancer screening later in life.
METHODS: Face to face interviews with 116 residents age 70 or over from two 
long-term care retirement communities. Interview content included questions 
about whether participants had discussed cancer screening with their physicians 
since turning age 70, their attitudes about information important for 
individualized decisions, and their attitudes about continuing cancer screening 
later in life.
RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of participants reported that they had an 
opportunity to discuss cancer screening with their physician since turning age 
70; 89% would have preferred to have had these discussions. Sixty-two percent 
believed their own life expectancy was not important for decision making, and 
48% preferred not to discuss life expectancy. Attitudes about continuing cancer 
screening were favorable. Most participants reported that they would continue 
screening throughout their lives and 43% would consider getting screened even if 
their doctors recommended against it. Only 13% thought that they would not live 
long enough to benefit from cancer screening tests. Factors important to 
consider stopping include: age, deteriorating or poor health, concerns about the 
effectiveness of the tests, and doctors recommendations.
CONCLUSION: This select group of older adults held positive attitudes about 
continuing cancer screening later in life, and many may have had unrealistic 
expectations. Individualized decision making could help clarify how life 
expectancy affects the potential survival benefits of cancer screening. Future 
research is needed to determine whether educating older adults about the 
importance of longevity in screening decisions would be acceptable, affect older 
adults' attitudes about screening, or change their screening behavior.

BACKGROUND: The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with three-dimensional 
conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment of a 70-year-old with 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed with the following states; posttreatment, 
hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and death. Transition probabilities from one 
state to another were calculated from rates derived from the literature for IMRT 
and 3D-CRT. Utility values for each health state were obtained from preliminary 
studies of preferences conducted at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The analysis took a 
payer's perspective. Expected mean costs, cost-effectiveness scatterplots, and 
cost acceptability curves were calculated with commercially available software.
RESULTS: The expected mean cost of patients undergoing IMRT was $47,931 with a 
survival of 6.27 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The expected mean cost of
