Koi herpesvirus (KHV) is a highly contagious virus that causes KHV disease 
(KHVD) inducing high mortality in carp and koi (Cyprinus carpio L.). In the late 
stage, latency occurs with very low, often non-detectable virus concentrations, 
which represents a challenge for virus detection. After validation according to 
OIE recommendations, an antibody ELISA was established to recognize antibodies 
of C. carpio against KHV infection. In this study, the ELISA was modified to 
detect anti-KHV antibodies from a non-cyprinid fish. Experimentally infected 
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were able to transmit KHV to naïve carp at 
two different temperatures, demonstrating their potential as a reservoir host. 
At 20°C, KHVD was induced in carp but not at 15°C. Unexpectedly, rainbow trout 
developed humoral response against KHV at both temperatures. In contrast to 
carp, at 15°C trout produced neutralizing antibodies but not at 20°C. While 
antibodies obtained from infected carp sera reacted in a similar way against all 
KHV, antibodies from rainbow trout sera reacted differently to the same isolates 
by ELISA. The data show that even when non-cyprinid fish species are infected 
with KHV, they can produce antibodies that differ from those observed in carp.

BACKGROUND: Patients with a bone sarcoma who undergo limb-sparing surgery and 
reconstruction with a tumor prosthesis in the lower extremity have been shown to 
have reduced self-reported physical function and quality of life (QoL). To 
provide patients facing these operations with better expectations of future 
physical function and to better evaluate and improve upon postoperative 
interventions, data from objectively measured physical function have been 
suggested.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to explore different aspects of physical function, 
using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health 
(ICF) as a framework, by asking: (1) What are the differences between patients 2 
to 12 years after a bone resection and reconstruction surgery of the hip and 
knee following resection of a bone sarcoma or giant cell tumor of bone and 
age-matched controls without walking limitations in ICF body functions (ROM, 
muscle strength, pain), ICF activity and participation (walking, getting up from 
a chair, daily tasks), and QoL? (2) Within the patient group, do ICF body 
functions and ICF activity and participation outcome scores correlate with QoL?
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2016, we treated 72 patients for bone sarcoma or giant 
cell tumor of bone resulting in bone resection and reconstruction with a tumor 
prosthesis of the hip or knee. At the timepoint for inclusion, 47 patients were 
alive. Of those, 6% (3 of 47) had undergone amputation in the lower limb and 
were excluded. A further 32% (14 of 44) were excluded because of being younger 
than 18 years of age, pregnant, having long transportation, palliative care, or 
declining participation, leaving 68% (30 of 44) for analysis. Thus, 30 patients 
and 30 controls with a mean age of 51 ± 18 years and 52 ± 17 years, 
respectively, were included in this cross-sectional study. Included patients had 
been treated with either a proximal femoral (40% [12 of 30]), distal femoral 
(47% [14 of 30]), or proximal tibia (13% [4 of 30]) reconstruction. The patients 
were assessed 2 to 12 years (mean 7 ± 3 years) after the 
resection-reconstruction. The controls were matched on gender and age (± 4 
years) and included if they considered their walking capacity to be normal and 
had no pain in the lower extremity. Included outcome measures were: passive ROM 
of hip flexion, extension, and abduction and knee flexion and extension; 
isometric muscle strength of knee flexion, knee extension and hip abduction 
using a hand-held dynamometer; pain intensity (numeric rating scale; NRS) and 
distribution (pain drawing); the 6-minute walk test (6MWT); the 30-second 
chair-stand test (CST); the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), and the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The TESS and the EORTC QLQ-C30 were normalized to 
0 to 100 points. Higher scoring represents better status for TESS and EORTC 
global health and physical functioning scales. Minimum clinically important 
difference for muscle strength is 20% to 25%, NRS 2 points, 6MWT 14 to 31 
meters, CST 2 repetitions, TESS 12 to 15 points, and EORTC QLQ-C30 5 to 20 
points.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, the patients had less knee extension and hip 
abduction strength in both the surgical and nonsurgical limbs and regardless of 
reconstruction site. Mean knee extension strength in patients versus controls 
were: surgical limb 0.9 ± 0.5 Nm/kg versus 2.1 ± 0.6 Nm/kg (mean difference -1.3 
Nm/kg [95% CI -1.5 to -1.0]; p < 0.001) and nonsurgical limb 1.7 ± 0.6 Nm/kg 
versus 2.2 ± 0.6 Nm/kg (mean difference -0.5 Nm/kg [95% CI -0.8 to -0.2]; p = 
0.003). Mean hip abduction strength in patients versus controls were: surgical 
limb 1.1 ± 0.4 Nm/kg versus 1.9 ± 0.5 Nm/kg (mean difference -0.7 Nm/kg [95% CI 
-1.0 to -0.5]; p < 0.001) and nonsurgical limb 1.5 ± 0.4 Nm/kg versus 1.9 ± 0.5 
Nm/kg (-0.4 Nm/kg [95% CI -0.6 to -0.2]; p = 0.001). Mean hip flexion ROM in 
patients with proximal femoral reconstructions was 113° ± 18° compared with 
controls 130° ± 11° (mean difference -17°; p = 0.006). Mean knee flexion ROM in 
patients with distal femoral reconstructions was 113° ± 29° compared with 
patients in the control group 146° ± 9° (mean difference -34°; p = 0.002). 
Eighty-seven percent (26 of 30) of the patients reported pain, predominantly in 
the knee, anterior thigh, and gluteal area. The patients showed poorer walking 
and chair-stand capacity and had lower TESS scores than patients in the control 
group. Mean 6MWT was 499 ± 100 meters versus 607 ± 68 meters (mean difference 
-108 meters; p < 0.001), mean CST was 12 ± 5 repetitions versus 18 ± 5 
repetitions (mean difference -7 repetitions; p < 0.001), and median 
(interquartile range) TESS score was 78 (21) points versus 100 (10) points (p < 
0.001) in patients and controls, respectively. Higher pain scores correlated to 
lower physical functioning of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Rho -0.40 to -0.54; all p 
values < 0.05). Less muscle strength in knee extension, knee flexion, and hip 
abduction correlated to lower physical functioning of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Rho 
0.40 to 0.51; all p values < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This patient group demonstrated clinically important muscle 
weaknesses not only in resected muscles but also in the contralateral limb. Many 
patients reported pain, and they showed reductions in walking and chair-stand 
capacity comparable to elderly people. The results are relevant for information 
before surgery, and assessments of objective physical function are advisable in 
postoperative monitoring. Prospective studies evaluating the course of physical 
function and which include assessments of objectively measured physical function 
are warranted. Studies following this patient group with repetitive measures 
over about 5 years could provide information about the course of physical 
function, enable comparisons with population norms, and lead to better-designed, 
targeted, and timely postoperative interventions.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

In recent years, the trigonometric families of continuous distributions have 
found a place of choice in the theory and practice of statistics, with the Sin-G 
family as leader. In this paper, we provide some contributions to the subject by 
introducing a flexible extension of the Sin-G family, called the transformed 
Sin-G family. It is constructed from a new polynomial-trigonometric function 
presenting a desirable "versatile concave/convex" property, among others. The 
modelling possibilities of the former Sin-G family are thus multiplied. This 
potential is also highlighted by a complete theoretical work, showing stochastic 
ordering results, studying the analytical properties of the main functions, 
deriving several kinds of moments, and discussing the reliability parameter as 
well. Then, the applied side of the proposed family is investigated, with 
numerical results and applications on the related models. In particular, the 
estimation of the unknown model parameters is performed through the use of the 
maximum likelihood method. Then, two real life data sets are analyzed by a new 
extended Weibull model derived to the considered trigonometric mechanism. We 
show that it performs the best among seven comparable models, illustrating the 
importance of the findings.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current guidelines recommend surveillance for patients with 
nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE) but do not include a recommended age 
for discontinuing surveillance. This study aimed to determine the optimal age 
for last surveillance of NDBE patients stratified by sex and level of 
comorbidity.
METHODS: We used 3 independently developed models to simulate patients diagnosed 
with NDBE, varying in age, sex, and comorbidity level (no, mild, moderate, and 
severe). All patients had received regular surveillance until their current age. 
We calculated incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
from 1 additional endoscopic surveillance at the current age versus not 
performing surveillance at that age. We determined the optimal age to end 
surveillance as the age at which incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1 more 
surveillance was just less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY.
RESULTS: The benefit of having 1 more surveillance endoscopy strongly depended 
on age, sex, and comorbidity. For men with NDBE and severe comorbidity, 1 
additional surveillance at age 80 years provided 4 more QALYs per 1000 patients 
with BE at an additional cost of $1.2 million, whereas for women with severe 
comorbidity the benefit at that age was 7 QALYs at a cost of $1.3 million. For 
men with no, mild, moderate, and severe comorbidity, the optimal ages of last 
surveillance were 81, 80, 77, and 73 years, respectively. For women, these ages 
were younger: 75, 73, 73, and 69 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative modeling analysis illustrates the importance of 
considering comorbidity status and sex when deciding on the age to discontinue 
surveillance in patients with NDBE.

Willingness to pay for quality and length of life gains in end of life patients 
of different ages.

Health gains are increasingly weighted in economic evaluations of new health 
technologies to guide resource-allocation decisions in healthcare. In Norway and 
the Netherlands weights are, for example, based on the disease severity of 
patients. In England and Wales, a higher weight is attached to quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained from life-extending end-of-life (EOL) treatments. 
Societal preferences for QALY gains in EOL patients are increasingly examined. 
Although the available evidence suggests that gains in health-related quality of 
life (QOL) may be preferred to gains in life expectancy (LE), little is known 
about the influence of EOL patients' age on these preferences. In this study, we 
examine the willingness to pay (WTP) for QOL and LE gains in EOL patients of 
different ages in a sample (n = 803) of the general public in the Netherlands. 
We found that WTP was relatively higher for QOL and LE gains in younger EOL 
patients. We further found indications suggesting that WTP may be relatively 
higher for QOL gains at the EOL, except for patients aged 20 for whom we 
observed a higher WTP for LE gains. Our results may inform discussions on 
attaching differential weights to QOL and LE gains in EOL patients of different 
ages with the objective to better align resource-allocation decisions with 
societal preferences.

Dietary restriction (DR) increases lifespan in a broad variety of organisms and 
improves health in humans. However, long-term transgenerational consequences of 
dietary interventions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of 
DR by temporary fasting (TF) on mortality risk, age-specific reproduction and 
fitness across three generations of descendants in Caenorhabditis elegans. We 
show that while TF robustly reduces mortality risk and improves late-life 
reproduction of the individuals subject to TF (P0), it has a wide range of both 
positive and negative effects on their descendants (F1-F3). Remarkably, 
great-grandparental exposure to TF in early life reduces fitness and increases 
mortality risk of F3 descendants to such an extent that TF no longer promotes a 
lifespan extension. These findings reveal that transgenerational trade-offs 
accompany the instant benefits of DR, underscoring the need to consider fitness 
of future generations in pursuit of healthy ageing.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is an important global health problem. In this study 
we aimed to analyze trends in cervical cancer at the global, regional, and 
national levels from 1990 to 2019, to inform health service decision-making.
METHODS: Data on cervical cancer was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 
study, 2019. Trends in cervical cancer burden were assessed based on estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) and age-standardized rate (ASR).
RESULTS: Globally, decreasing trends were observed in incidence, death, and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of cervical cancer from 1990 to 2019, 
with respective EAPCs of - 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI]: - 0.41 to 
- 0.34), - 0.93 (95%CI: - 0.98 to - 0.88), and - 0.95 (95 CI%: - 1.00 to 
- 0.90). Meanwhile, decreasing trends were detected in most sociodemographic 
index (SDI) areas and geographic regions, particularly death and DALYs in 
Central Latin America, with respective EAPCs of - 2.61 (95% CI: - 2.76 to 
- 2.46) and - 2.48 (95% CI: - 2.63 to - 2.32); hhowever, a pronounced increasing 
trend in incidence occurred in East Asia (EAPC = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.55). At 
the national level, decreasing trends in cervical cancer were observed in most 
countries/territories, particularly DALYs in the Maldives (EAPC = - 5.06; 95% 
CI: - 5.40 to - 4.72), Whereas increasing trends were detected in Lesotho, 
Zimbabwe, and Bulgaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Slowly decreasing trends in cervical cancer were detected worldwide 
from 1990 to 2019. Cervical cancer remains a substantial health problem for 
women globally, requiring more effective prevention and control strategies.

Massive (or life-threatening) haemoptysis is a time-sensitive emergency 
encountered by a physician that requires an interdisciplinary, collaborative 
effort to arrest the bleeding in a prompt and timely manner. Placement of an 
endobronchial Watanabe spigot (EWS) to halt haemoptysis is a relatively recent 
technique finding its wide application in airway pathology, with the current 
extension of its use to bronchial bleeding. However, the lack of immediate 
access to EWS gives rise to the need to innovate with day-to-day materials used 
in routine surgical practice and available in resource-limited settings, which 
may serve the purpose of a spigot. In this report, we bring to light a case of 
life-threatening, cryptogenic haemoptysis that was managed by a novel technique 
of using peanut gauze as a spigot resulting in a successful endobronchial 
tamponade.

programme that is likely to improve the functional mobility and quality of life 
(QOL) of elderly in the community.
METHODS: This trial included elderly adults (88% female) aged 60 years or older 
and who were sedentary and without cognitive decline. The participants were 
randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG, home physical exercise and sleep 
hygiene) and a control group (CG, sleep hygiene). The International 
Questionnaire on Physical Activity, mental state mini-exam, World Health 
Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module (WHOQOL-OLD) and the 
Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests were conducted before and after the 12-week 
intervention period.
RESULTS: The study was concluded with 125 elderly participants. Anthropometric 
data were indicative of pre-obesity, with a mean body mass index of 27.3 ± 4, a 
low-income socio-economic profile (78% ≤ 2 SM) and low schooling rates 
(76% ≤ 3 years of study). Most of the elderly (87%) were considered physically 
active with IPAQ > 150 min/week. The group of elderly people who performed the 
home physical exercise programme showed a significant improvement in functional 
mobility according to the time of execution of the TUG test before (9.1 ± 2) and 
after (7.1 ± 1) with an average reduction of 2 ± 1 s (P < .01). The difference 
in the QOL of the elderly who participated in the exercise protocol was also 
observed, verified through the WHOQOL-OLD global score, which presented an 
initial score of 85 ± 10, changing to 90.4 ± 9 after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: Semi-supervised physical home exercise is safe and effective in 
improving the functional mobility and QOL of sedentary elderly people in the 
community.

It is crucial to evaluate ethical issues regarding evacuation orders, especially 
after a nuclear disaster. After the Fukushima accident in 2011, the Japanese 
government ordered the affected people to evacuate. The evacuation orders have 
now been lifted in many areas. A risk trade-off analysis between benefits and 
risk associated with returning home would help in evaluating the justification 
for the lifting of the evacuation order in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster. 
Here, we performed a risk trade-off analysis among people returning home after 
the lifting of an evacuation order between an increase in emotional happiness 
(positive effect) and loss of life expectancy due to additional radiation 
exposure (negative effect), using a happy life expectancy (HpLE) indicator. 
Emotional happiness was estimated using questionnaires distributed among the 
affected people who lived in municipalities where evacuation orders were lifted. 
Loss of life expectancy was estimated under a scenario that returnees received 
20 mSv in the year of return and subsequent radiation exposure. Increase in 
emotional happiness due to returning home was ~1-2 orders of magnitude higher 
among women aged 20, 40 and 65 years than the loss of life expectancy due to 
additional radiation exposure. This finding has implications for the 
justification for the lifting of evacuation orders.

During winter, snow and ice on roads in regions with cold weather can increase 
traffic crashes and casualties, resulting in travel delays and financial burdens 
to society. Anti-icing or deicing the roads can serve a cost-effective method to 
significantly reduce such risks. Although traditionally the main priorities of 
winter road maintenance (WRM) have been level of service, cost-effectiveness, 
and corrosion reduction, it is increasingly clear that understanding the 
environmental impacts of deicers is vital. One of the most important problems in 
this regard is environmental contamination caused by cumulative use of deicers, 
which has many detrimental effects on the aquatic systems. Among the deicers, 
the chloride-based ones raise the most toxicological concerns because they are 
highly soluble, can migrate quickly in the environment and have cumulative 
effects over time. In this review, we summarize and organize existing data, 
including the latest findings about the adverse effects of deicers on surface 
water and groundwater, aquatic species, and human health, and identify future 
research priorities. In addition, the data provided can be used to develop a 
framework for quantifying some of the variables that stakeholders and agencies 
use when preparing guidelines and standards for WRM programs. PRACTITIONER 
POINTS: Pollution from the increasing use of roadway deicers may have 
detrimental effects on the environment. Of particular concern are the acute and 
cumulative risks that chloride salts pose to aquatic species. Chloride salts are 
water-soluble, very difficult to remove, highly mobile, and non-degradable. 
Deicers cause water stratification, change the chemicophysical properties of 
water, and affect aquatic species and human health. Current guidelines may not 
be appropriate for environmental protection and need to be revised.

Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by 
accumulation of propionic acid due to deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. 
Main stay of treatment focuses on reducing dietary protein. However, orthotropic 
liver transplantation decreases the frequency of metabolic decompensations and 
improves life expectancy. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy undergoing 
orthotropic liver transplantation to treat propionic acidemia. This case 
highlights the use of intraoperative monitoring of metabolic markers like urine 
ketones, arterial ammonia, and lactate levels as these patients are at risk for 
hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis. Also, the relevance in outcomes when 
performing early extubation in fast-tracking recovery.

Increased life expectancy and advances in the care of chronic liver disease has 
increased the number of elderly patients needing liver transplant. Organ 
donation policies prioritize transplant to the sickest. There is an ongoing 
debate with regard to balancing the principles of equity and utility. Several 
hospitals have adopted center-specific policies and there has been an increased 
trend of transplant in elderly patients since 2002. Appropriate patient 
selection and long-term outcomes in the setting of limited organ availability 
pose several challenges. This article reviews the data and discusses the pros 
and cons of transplants in the elderly.

Drought is a critical abiotic stressor that modulates soybean yield. Drought 
stress drastically enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and 
maintaining ROS content above a cytostatic level but below a cytotoxic level is 
essential for normal biology processes in plants. At present, most of the known 
ROS-scavenging systems are in the cytoplasm, and the mechanism of ROS regulation 
in the nucleus remains unclear. GmNTF2B-1 is a member of the IV subgroup in the 
nucleus transporter family. Its expression is localized to the roots and is 
stimulated by drought stress. In this study, the overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 was 
found to improve the drought tolerance of transgenic soybean by influencing the 
ROS content in plants. An oxidoreductase, GmOXR17, was identified to interact 
with GmNTF2B-1 in the nucleus through the yeast two-hybrid, 
coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. The 
drought tolerance of GmOXR17 transgenic soybean was similar to that of 
GmNTF2B-1. GmNTF2B-1 was expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and GmOXR17 
transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under drought stress. The 
overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 enhanced the nuclear entry of GmOXR17, and the 
overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 or GmOXR17 could decrease the H2 O2 content and 
oxidation level in the nucleus. In conclusion, the interaction between GmNTF2B-1 
and GmOXR17 may enhance the nuclear entry of GmOXR17, thereby enhancing nuclear 
ROS scavenging to improve the drought resistance of soybean.

PURPOSE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare hematologic malignancy 
accounting for 0.8% of new cancer diagnoses in Australia. High mortality and 
morbidity affect work productivity through workforce dropout and premature 
death. This study sought to estimate the productivity loss attributable to AML 
in the Australian population over 10 years and to estimate the costs of this 
productivity loss. Productivity was measured using productivity-adjusted life 
years (PALYs), a similar concept to quality-adjusted life years, but adjusts for 
the productivity loss attributable to disease, rather than impaired health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic life tables modeled the Australian working 
population (age 15-65 years) between 2020 and 2029. The model population had two 
cohorts: those with and without AML. Differences in life years, PALYs, and costs 
represented the health and productivity impact of AML. Secondary analyses 
evaluated the impact of different scenarios.
RESULTS: Over the next 10 years, there will be 7,600 years of life lost and 
7,337 PALYs lost because of AML, amounting to Australian dollars (AU$) 1.43 
billion in lost gross domestic product ($971 million in US dollars). Secondary 
analyses highlight potential savings of approximately AU$52 million if survival 
rates were improved by 20% and almost AU$118 million in savings if the 
return-to-work rates increased by 20% on the current estimates.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that even in low-incidence cancer, high 
mortality and morbidity translate to profound impacts on years of life, 
productivity, and the broader economy. Better treatment strategies are likely to 
result in significant economic gains. This highlights the value of investing in 
research for improved therapies.

OBJECTIVE: Single-use negative pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) following closed 
surgical incisions has a demonstrable effect in reducing surgical site 
complications (SSC). However, there is little health economic evidence to 
support its widespread use. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
sNPWT compared with standard care in reducing SSCs following closed surgical 
incisions.
METHOD: A decision analytic model was developed to explore the total costs and 
health outcomes associated with the use of the interventions in patients 
following vascular, colorectal, cardiothoracic, orthopaedic, C-section and 
breast surgery from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and US payer 
perspective over a 12-week time horizon. We modelled complications avoided 
(surgical site infection (SSI) and dehiscence) using data from a recently 
published meta-analysis. Cost data were sourced from published literature, NHS 
reference costs and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We conducted 
subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes, an American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥3 and body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m2. A 
sensitivity analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: sNPWT resulted in better clinical outcomes and overall savings of £105 
per patient from the UK perspective and $637 per patient from the US 
perspective. There were more savings when higher-risk patients with diabetes, or 
a BMI ≥30kg/m2 or an ASA≥3 were considered. We conducted both one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and the results suggested that this 
conclusion is robust.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the use of sNPWT following closed surgical 
incisions saves cost when compared with standard care because of reduced 
incidence of SSC. Patients at higher risk should be targeted first as they 
benefit more from sNPWT. This analysis is underpinned by strong and robust 
clinical evidence from both randomised and observational studies.

Background: Patients who have Parkinson's disease (PD) comorbid with dementia is 
common. With the prolonged life expectancy, dementia is gradually becoming 
prevalent and affects most patients' life qualities. However, the efficacy of 
current treatments in dementia of PD is limited. Previous studies indicated the 
potential roles of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating dementia, yet the 
correlation between CHM usage and risk of dementia in PD patients is unclear. 
Methods: This case-control study was nested within a National Health Insurance 
database of patients over 50 years with newly diagnosed PD from year 2000 to 
2010. Among these PD patients, dementia and nondementia groups were discussed, 
respectively, in terms of the duration of taking CHM (≥90 vs. <90 days), age 
(50-64 vs. ≥65 years) and gender. Results: The risk of dementia in patients with 
PD is lower in CHM users compared with non-CHM users, especially in those taking 
CHM for more than 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.58; 95% confidence 
interval [95% CI] 0.39-0.87). The use of CHM was significantly related to the 
lower risk of dementia in the subgroups of patients with age ≥65 years for CHM 
usage <90 days (aOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.88), patients with age ≥65 years for CHM 
usage ≥90 days (aOR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42-0.94), female patients using CHM for ≥90 
days (aOR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22-0.84), and male patients using CHM for <90 days (aOR 
0.62; 95% CI 0.43-0.88). Conclusions: The authors demonstrated the association 
of CHM usage with lower risk of dementia in patients with PD, especially in 
women with the usage of CHM for more than 90 days. Since no arbitrary causal 
conclusions could be drawn from retrospective cohort studies, the finding in 
this study could be used to generate a hypothesis for a subsequent design of 
prospective longitudinal study.

Rationale: A trial of four financial incentive programs, conducted at CVS 
Caremark, a large employer, documented their effectiveness in promoting 
sustained abstinence from smoking, but their cost-effectiveness is unknown, and 
the significant up-front cost of the incentives is a deterrent to their 
adoption. Objectives: To determine the cost-effectiveness of these incentives 
from the healthcare sector and employer perspectives. Methods: This study 
examines a decision model built with trial data, supplemented by data from the 
literature. Life-expectancy gains for quitters were projected on the basis of 
U.S. life tables. The two individual-oriented programs paid $800 for smoking 
cessation at 6 months; one required participants to deposit $150 at baseline. 
Payments in the two group-oriented programs varied with the group's success; 
again, one required participants to deposit $150. Results: Life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (2012 dollars), and 
cost-effectiveness ratios are described. From the healthcare sector perspective, 
costs ranged from $3,200 per life-year ($2,500 per QALY) for the competitive 
deposit program, compared with usual care, to $6,500 per life-year ($5,100 per 
QALY) for the individual reward program. From the employer perspective, costs 
ranged from $256,600 per life-year gained for the individual deposit program to 
$1,711,100 per life-year gained for the individual reward program; the cost per 
QALY ranged from $65,300 for the competitive deposit program to $128,800 for the 
individual reward program. Cost-effectiveness from the employer perspective 
improved with longer decision horizons. Including future medical costs reduced 
cost-effectiveness from both perspectives. Conclusions: Four financial incentive 
programs that paid smokers to quit are very cost-effective from the healthcare 
sector perspective. They are more expensive from the employer perspective but 
may be cost-effective for employers with longer decision horizons.

Although previous studies suggest that prolonged intense exercise such as 
marathon running transitorily alters cardiac function, there is little 
information regarding ultramarathon races. Aim of this study was to investigate 
the acute impact of ultra-endurance exercise (UEE) on heart, applying advanced 
strain imaging. Echocardiographic assessment was performed the day before and at 
the finish line of "Spartathlon": A 246 Km ultra-marathon running race. 2D 
speckle-tracking echocardiography was performed in all four chambers, evaluating 
longitudinal strain (LS) for both ventricles and atria. Peak strain values and 
temporal parameters adjusted for heart rate were extracted from the derived 
curves. Out of 60 participants initially screened, 27 athletes (19 male, age 
45 ± 7 years) finished the race in 33:34:27(28:50:38-35:07:07) hours. Absolute 
values of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) LS (RVLS -22.9 ± 3.6 pre- to 
-21.2 ± 3.0% post-, p=0.04 and LVLS -20.9 ± 2.3 pre- to -18.8 ± 2.0 post-, 
p=0.009) slightly decreased post-race, whereas atrial strain did not change. RV 
and LV LS decrease was caused mainly by strain impairment of basal regions with 
apical preservation. Inter-chamber relationships assessed through RV/LV, LV/LA, 
RV/RA and RA/LA peak values' ratios remained unchanged from pre to post-race. 
Finally, UEE caused an extension of the systolic phase of cardiac cycle with 
concomitant diastole reduction (p<0.001 for all strain curves). Conclusively,
