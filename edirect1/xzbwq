(>55% 14-year mortality). Of the 417 patients who underwent biopsy, 149 (35.7%) 
were found to have prostate cancer. There was no significant difference in the 
rate of positive biopsies (P = .72), distribution of Gleason scores (P = .60), 
or percentage of positive biopsy cores (P = .74) between mortality risk groups. 
However, by UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, there was 
significant trend toward higher-risk prostate cancer in men with intermediate 
and high-mortality risk (P = .04).
CONCLUSION: In this analysis, a large number of men with limited life 
expectancies underwent prostate biopsy. The majority of these men had negative 
biopsies or low-risk cancers, suggesting that they were unlikely to benefit from 
biopsy. To avoid potentially unnecessary prostate biopsies, the practitioner 
must give serious consideration to a patient's age and medical comorbidities 
before making a recommendation as to whether biopsy should be performed.

We present a scalable, integrated strategy for coupled protein and RNA detection 
from single cells. Our approach leverages the DNA polymerase activity of reverse 
transcriptase to simultaneously perform proximity extension assays and 
complementary DNA synthesis in the same reaction. Using the Fluidigm C1™ system, 
we profile the transcriptomic and proteomic response of a human breast 
adenocarcinoma cell line to a chemical perturbation, benchmarking against in 
situ hybridizations and immunofluorescence staining, as well as recombinant 
proteins, ERCC Spike-Ins, and population lysate dilutions. Through supervised 
and unsupervised analyses, we demonstrate synergies enabled by simultaneous 
measurement of single-cell protein and RNA abundances. Collectively, our 
generalizable approach highlights the potential for molecular metadata to inform 
highly-multiplexed single-cell analyses.

BACKGROUND: Recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) following liver 
transplantation (LT) is universal for those with ongoing viraemia and is 
associated with higher rates of allograft failure and death. However, the 
optimal timing of HCV treatment for patients awaiting transplant remains 
unclear.
AIM: To evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of treating HCV pre-LT vs. 
post-LT (pre-emptive or after HCV recurrence).
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was created to simulate the progression 
of a cohort of HCV-genotype 1 or 4 cirrhotic patients from the time of 
transplant listing until death. We then used this model to study the 
cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) with ribavirin for 12 
weeks, administered for three separate treatment strategies: (i) pre-LT; (ii) 
post-LT preemptively prior to HCV recurrence; or (iii) post-LT after HCV 
recurrence.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using a median model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) score <25 at the time of transplant, we found that pre-LT 
treatment of HCV led to more QALYs for fewer dollars compared to other 
strategies. Analysis limited to living donor LT recipients revealed that pre-LT 
treatment was also the most cost-effective strategy. When the analysis was 
repeated for MELD ≥25, decompensated disease (Child-Pugh class B or C), and 
hepatocellular carcinoma cases, preemptive post-LT strategy was more 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of HCV prior to liver transplantation appears to be the 
most cost-effective strategy for patients with a MELD score <25. For patients 
with a MELD ≥25 or decompensated cirrhosis, preemptive post-liver 
transplantation treatment before HCV recurrence is the most cost-effective 
strategy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of total knee arthroplasty on 
patients with knee osteoarthritis combined with mild to moderate valgus knee 
deformity. 
METHODS: A total of 15 patients received total knee arthroplasty for correcting 
mild (10°-15°) to moderate (15°-30°) valgus knee between January 2011 and 
February 2014 in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. We adopted a 
stable prosthesis surgery through patellar medial approach, osteophytes 
cleaning, conventional osteotomy, a selective soft tissue release and balance 
technical correcting of knee valgus deformity. Then conventional anticoagulation 
and symptomatic rehabilitation was utilized. Preoperative and postoperative 
X-ray was conducted in patients with measuring femor-tibial angle (FTA) and 
inspecting the prosthesis position. FTA, visual analog scale (VAS) standard, and 
parallel knee scoring system (KSS) were used to evaluate the clinical effect. 
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were followed up for 14 to 36 (22.40±11.88) months. 
The hospitalization time was 7-13 (7.73±1.58) d; operative time was 58-110 
(81.8±16.85) min, the dominant blood loss was 140-600 (337.30±143.65) mL. Two 
cases had knee extension hysteresis, and the knee activity recovered after 
exercise. Leg power lines were normal. Three postoperative cases suffered 
anterior knee pain. They were subjected to celecoxib analgesic treatment and the 
pain gradually eased after 3 months. One postoperative case showed incision 
discharge and swelling, which was healed after change of dressing. During 
follow-up, review of X-ray film does not show prosthesis loose, subsidence and 
other complications. The knee valgus angle (8.1±1.8)°, knee motion range 
(107.33±9.61)°, KSS knee score (74.7±14.5, 75.3±2.7) and pain score (2.5±0.9) 
were significantly better than the preoperative (P<0.05). The clinical and 
function KSS scores showed that the improvement rate was 80%.  
CONCLUSION: Total knee arthroplasty is an effective way to treat patients with 
knee osteoarthritis combined with mild to moderate valgus knee deformity. The 
correction of deformity and improvement of joint function can be achieved 
significantly. The clinical result is satisfactory and patients' quality of life 
is improved.

Anemia is a common complication of cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
associated with decreased physical performance as well as poor prognosis for 
life expectancy. Renal and cancer-induced anemia share common features regarding 
pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies. It is typically treated with iron 
substitution, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and in refractory cases 
with red blood cell transfusions. However, studies of the past few years 
unveiled numerous setbacks in the use of ESAs. These included a higher risk of 
cerebrovascular events and increased mortality without the improvement of 
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. Moreover, particularly negative 
results were observed in patients with previous cancer history under ESA 
therapy. These unfavorable findings have forced the clinicians to reevaluate the 
management of renal anemia. This led to decrease of ESA usage, while iron 
substitution and alternative therapeutic options gained more significance. Iron 
supplementation is also accompanied with certain risks ranging from 
gastrointestinal complications to severe allergic reactions and increased rate 
of infections. Furthermore, the evaluation of the long-term safety of excessive 
iron therapy is still lacking, especially in CKD patients with cancer. In the 
absence of these clinical studies, this review aims to summarize the currently 
available therapeutic strategies in anemia management of CKD patients with 
concomitant cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As treatments for primary cancers continue to improve life 
expectancy, unfortunately, brain metastases also appear to be constantly 
increasing and life expectancy for patients with brain metastases is low. Longer 
survival and improved quality of life may be achieved using localised 
radiological and surgical approaches in addition to low dose corticosteroids. 
Stereotactic brain radiotherapy is one rapidly evolving localized radiation 
treatment. This article describes our experience with stereotactic radiotherapy 
using a linear accelerator.
METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, from the 
time of its introduction into daily practice in our Department of Oncology in 
2014. We collected the data on patient treatment and predicted survival based on 
prognostic indices and actual patient outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, in 
one case in combination with whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal sparing. 
There was no significant treatment related toxicity during the treatment or 
follow-up and due to the small number of fractions, the overall tolerance of the 
treatment was excellent. The patient intrafractional movement in all cases was 
under 1 mm suggesting that 1 mm margin around the CTV to create the PTV is 
sufficient and also that patient immobilization using the thermoplastic mask 
compared with invasive techniques, is feasible. We also found that prognostic 
indices such as the Graded Prognostic Assessment provide accurate predictions of 
patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our current evidence, patients with brain metastases fit 
enough, should be considered for stereotactic radiotherapy treatment.

University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia constitutes one of the major causes of 
worldwide mortality in young children. Poverty has been traditionally assigned 
as the underlying factor accounting for these trends. However, the independent 
role of solid fuel use yielding biomass pollution on pneumonia rates among young 
children has not been extensively examined.
METHODS: Independent socio-economic variables, and the percentage of solid fuel 
use, tobacco consumption, improved water access source and sanitation facilities 
were extracted for each country from the available public databases. 
Multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess potential associations 
between these recognized risk factors and country pneumonia incidence in young 
children <5 years of age.
RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression analyses yielded two models that 
accounted for approximately 87% of the variance, and included solid fuel use, 
tobacco consumption, sanitation access, measles immunization, life expectancy, 
access to electricity and the Human Development Index (HDI) as being 
independently associated with the number of annual pneumonia cases per child 
<5 years of age.
CONCLUSION: In this ecological study, current country rates of pneumonia among 
young children are independently associated with the use of solid fuels. We 
postulate that interventions aimed at reducing indoor solid fuel biomass 
pollution through implementation of efficient stoves will translate into 
meaningful decreases in child mortality and morbidity.

Myocardial Infarction and Aortic Root Mycotic Aneurysm Complicating Aortic Valve 
Endocarditis: Utility of Cardiac CT.

Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Aortic mycotic aneurysms are a rare but life-threatening potential complication 
of infective endocarditis. Rapid deterioration of the vascular wall in highly 
focal areas makes these pseudoaneurysms particularly prone to rupture, resulting 
in uncontrolled aortic hemorrhage. While computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of mycotic aneurysms, it is 
not routinely performed in patients with known or suspected infective 
endocarditis (IE). However, current valvular heart disease guidelines support 
the use of cardiac CTA in cases of IE and suspected perivalvular extension when 
there is inadequate or ambiguous visualization on echocardiography. Here, we 
describe a case of IE in which cardiac CTA was used for two purposes: to assess 
perivalvular complications and to define coronary anatomy in a patient with a 
suspected embolic myocardial infarction. Subsequent detection of an aortic root 
mycotic aneurysm not previously demonstrated on transthoracic or transesophageal 
echocardiography allowed for timely and uncomplicated surgical intervention, 
while avoiding invasive coronary angiography.

BACKGROUND: The costs of treating eating disorders are often considered high.
AIMS: The objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN).
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients entering treatment of AN completed the 15D 
health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire before and 2 years after 
the start of treatment. Direct hospital costs were obtained. Quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained were calculated and cost-utility assessed.
RESULTS: Patients' baseline HRQoL was severely impaired. During follow-up, mean 
HRQoL improved statistically significantly. The cost per QALY gained was €5296 
(best-case scenario) or €64 440 (base-case scenario) (€11 559 or €71 600 
discounted 3%) depending on the assumptions used in the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY was in the same range as that of many other 
interventions provided in specialized medical care and within the limits usually 
considered acceptable, indicating that the treatment of AN is cost-effective.

Blood cell microparticles as biomarkers of hemostatic abnormalities in patients 
with implanted cardiac assist devices.

For heart failure patients unable to undergo cardiac transplantation, mechanical 
circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices can be utilized. These 
devices improve quality of life and prolong life expectancy, but they are 
associated with bleeding and thrombotic complications impacting patient 
survival. Little is known of the relevant mechanisms of these hemostatic issues, 
hindering identification of a clinically useful biomarker. However, there is 
suggestive evidence that blood cell-derived microparticles may fulfill this 
unmet clinical need. Recent publications have shown an association of up 
regulated microparticle production with implanted left ventricular assist 
devices and the potential to use this as a biomarker to predict thrombosis (and 
perhaps other adverse events) with an onset time earlier than currently used 
clinical indicators.

The widespread overuse of pesticides in agriculture has generated increasing 
concerns about the negative effects of pesticides on human health and the 
environment. Understanding farmers' perceptions of risk of pesticides and the 
determinants of pesticide overuse is important to modifying their behavior 
towards reducing pesticide use. A survey of 250 randomly selected smallholder 
vegetable farmers in Kuwait was conducted to quantify the extent of pesticide 
use, their pesticide risk perceptions and factors influencing their pesticide 
use behaviors. The majority of the farmers perceived pesticides pose some risk 
to the environment (65%) and human health (70.5%), while younger farmers were 
more likely to perceive this risk than older farmers. When asked to rate how 
risky pesticides were regarding several aspects of human health and the 
environment on a scale of 1(not risky) to 5 (extremely risky), concern was 
highest for the health of applicators (x̅=4.28) and lowest for air quality 
(x̅=2.32). The risk perceptions of the farmers did not have a positive influence 
on their pesticide use practices. A total of 76 pesticide active ingredients 
were found in use, and 9% of these belong to the WHO toxicity class II 
(moderately hazardous). On average, farmers applied 12.8kg of active ingredients 
per hectare per year, and 58% of the farmers were found to have overused 
pesticides, with an average overuse rate of 2.5kg. Pesticide application 
frequency ranged from two times a month up to once a week, depending on the 
crop. A binary probit model reveals that farmers' inadequate knowledge of 
pesticides, the influence of pesticide retailers and lack of access to 
non-synthetic methods of pest control are positively associated with pesticide 
overuse, while the propensity to overuse decreases with higher levels of 
education, training in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and the safe use and 
handling of pesticides, and access to extension support. Comprehensive 
intervention measures for reducing pesticide overuse and limit the health and 
environmental hazards caused by pesticides are provided in this paper.

Metabolic Acidosis Assessment in High-Risk Surgeries: Prognostic Importance.

Silva JM Jr(1), Ribas Rosa de Oliveira AM, Mendes Nogueira FA, Vianna PM, 
Amendola CP, Carvalho Carmona MJ, Sá Malbouisson LM.

SP/Brazil; †Anesthesiology Department, Hospital do Servidor Público 
Estadual-IAMSPE, SP, SP/Brazil; and ‡Intensive Care Department, Hospital do 
Câncer de Barretos, SP, SP/Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic acidosis frequently is present in surgical patients; 
however, different types of metabolic acidosis (hyperlactatemia, hyperchloremia, 
and others) may have different relationships to perioperative outcomes. We 
hypothesized that in postoperative surgical patients, distinctive types of 
metabolic acidosis would correlate differently with the outcomes of high-risk 
surgeries.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational study was performed in 3 
different tertiary care hospitals. Patients who required postoperative admission 
to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in this study. Patients with a 
short life expectancy (those with untreated cancer and limited treatment), 
hepatic failure, renal failure, or a diagnosis of diabetes were excluded. 
Patients were classified at ICU admission according to the presence and type of 
metabolic acidosis into 4 groups: those without acidosis, those with a base 
excess <-4 mmol/L and albumin-corrected anion gap ≤12 mmol/L (hyperchloremic), 
those with a base excess <-4 mmol/L and increased albumin-corrected anion gap 
>12 mmol/L, and those with a base excess <-4 mmol/L and hyperlactatemia >2 
mmol/L. Furthermore, patients were reclassified 12 hours after admission to the 
ICU to verify the metabolic acidosis behavior and outcome differences among the 
groups.
RESULTS: The study included 618 patients. The incidence of acidosis at ICU 
admission was 59.1%; 23.9% presented with hyperchloremia, 21.3% with 
hyperlactatemia, 13.9% with increased anion gap, and 40.9% of the patients 
presented without metabolic acidosis. Patients whose metabolic acidosis 
persisted for 12 hours had an incidence of ICU complications rates in 
hyperlactatemia group of 68.8%, increased anion gap of 68.6%, hyperchloremic of 
65.8%, and those without acidosis over 12 hours of 59.3%. A Cox regression model 
for postoperative 30-day mortality showed: in hyperlactatemic acidosis, hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.96; increased anion gap 
acidosis, HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 0.85-3.81; hyperchloremic acidosis, HR = 1.47, 95% 
CI = 0.75-2.89, and 10.3% of 30-day mortality rate in patients without acidosis. 
An adjusted survival curve by Cox regression found a worse 30-day survival in 
the hyperlactatemic group compared with the other groups (P = .03). Furthermore, 
in multiple comparisons among groups, patients with hyperlactatemic acidosis 
were more likely to develop renal dysfunction (P < .001) up to the seventh day 
postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that among patients with different types of acidosis, 
patients who developed hyperlactatemic metabolic acidosis postoperatively showed 
greater rates of renal dysfunction within 7 days and hyperlactatemic acidosis 
represented an independent factor on 30-day mortality in high-risk surgical 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Many intervention-based studies aiming to improve mental health do 
not include a multi-attribute utility instrument (MAUI) that produces 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and it limits the applicability of the 
health economic analyses. This study aims to develop 'crosswalk' transformation 
algorithm between a measure for psychological distress General Health 
Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and MAUI EuroQoL (EQ-5D-3L).
METHODS: The study is based on a survey questionnaire sent to a random sample in 
four counties in Sweden in 2012. The survey included GHQ-12 and EQ-5D 
instruments, as well as a question about self-rated health. The EQ-5D index was 
calculated using the UK and the Swedish tariff values. Two OLS models were used 
to estimate the EQ-5D health state values using the GHQ-12 as exposure, based on 
the respondents (n = 17, 101) of two counties. The algorithms were applied to 
the data from two other counties, (n = 15, 447) to check the predictive capacity 
of the models.
RESULTS: The final models included gender, age, self-rated health and GHQ-12 
scores as a quantitative variable. The regression equations explained 40 % (UK 
tariff) and 46 % (Swedish tariff) of the variances. The model showed a 
satisfying predictive capacity between the observed and the predicted EQ-5D 
index score, with Pearson correlation = 0.65 and 0.69 for the UK and Swedish 
models, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The algorithms developed in this study can be used to determine 
cost-effectiveness of services or interventions that use GHQ-12 as a primary 
outcome where the utility measures are not collected.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and mortality of 
stomach cancer, and its relationship with the Human Development Index (HDI) and 
its components in Asia in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ecological study was conducted based on GLOBOCAN 
project of WHO for Asian countries. We assessed the correlations between 
standardized incidence rates (SIR) and standardized mortality rates (SMR) of 
stomach cancer with HDI and its components using SPSS18.
RESULTS: A total of 696,231 cases (68.7% in males and 31.3% in females, ratio of 
2.19:1) and 524,465 deaths (67.1% in men and 33.0% in women, ratio 2.03:1) were 
included in 2012. Five countries with the highest SIR of stomach cancer were 
Republic Korea, Mongolia, Japan, China and Tajikistan. Five countries with the 
highest SMR of stomach cancer were Mongolia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan 
and China. Correlation between HDI and SIR was 0.241 (p = 0.106), in men 0.236 
(p = 0.114) and in women -0.250 (p = 0.094). Also between HDI and SMR -0.250 (p 
= 0.871) in men -0.018 (p = 0.903) and in women -0.014 (p = 0.927).
CONCLUSIONS: No significant correlation was observed between the SIR of stomach 
cancer, and the HDI and its dimensions, such as life expectancy at birth, mean 
years of schooling, and income level of the population.

Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran E-mail : mahin.ahmadipishkuhi@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the leading causes of death, 
especially in developed countries. The human development index (HDI) and its 
dimensions seem correlated with incidence and mortality rates of PC. This study 
aimed to assess the association of the specific components of HDI (life 
expectancy at birth, education, gross national income per 1000 capita, health, 
and living standards) with burden indicators of PC worldwide.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information of the incidence and mortality rates of PC 
was obtained from the GLOBOCAN cancer project in year 2012 and data about the 
HDI 2013 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between 
incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using STATA 
software.
RESULTS: A significant inequality of PC incidence rates was observed according 
to concentration indexes=0.25 with 95% CI (0.22, 0.34) and a negative mortality 
concentration index of -0.04 with 95% CI (-0.09, 0.01) was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive significant correlation was detected between the 
incidence rates of PC and the HDI and its dimensions including life expectancy 
at birth, education, income, urbanization level and obesity. However, there was 
a negative significant correlation between the standardized mortality rates and 
the life expectancy, income and HDI.

BACKGROUND: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) increases the psychological 
exibility of people afflicted with cancer, and consequently improves their 
adaptability. The present research was conducted with the aim of determining the 
effectiveness of ACT for people afflicted with cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research was of semi-pilot type with a 
pre-test and post-test plan for the proof group. The demographics of the 
community were composed of all the women with cancer who were under treatment in 
Tehran's Dehshpour therapeutic center in 2015. The sample was composed of 24 
people who were selected as available and chosen randomly in two groups of test 
and proof. All the participants responded to Snyder questionnaire in two 
pre-test and post-test stages, and the test group participated in treatment 
sessions after conducting the pre-test.
RESULTS: After collecting the information, data analysis was conducted in two 
description and inferential levels. The test results of covariance analysis 
showed that the two groups' hope was meaningfully different. Hope in the test 
group, compared to the proof group, increased meaningfully.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the ACT is effective in increasing hope of 
patients with cancer.

The food industry has been under growing pressure to feed an exponentially 
increasing world population and challenged to meet rigorous food safety law and 
regulation. The plethora of media consumption has provoked consumer demand for 
safe, sustainable, organic, and wholesome products with "clean" labels. The 
application of active and intelligent packaging has been commercially adopted by 
food and pharmaceutical industries as a solution for the future for extending 
shelf life and simplifying production processes; facilitating complex 
distribution logistics; reducing, if not eliminating the need for preservatives 
in food formulations; enabling restricted food packaging applications; providing 
convenience, improving quality, variety and marketing features; as well as 
providing essential information to ensure consumer safety. This chapter reviews 
innovations of active and intelligent packaging which advance packaging 
technology through both scavenging and releasing systems for shelf life 
extension, and through diagnostic and identification systems for communicating 
quality, tracking and brand protection.

This study aims to estimate the burden of disease (BOD) due to secondhand 
smoking (SHS) in Korea. SHS-related diseases were selected via systematic 
review. Population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated by using standard 
formula. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated using Statistical 
Office and Health Insurance data. SHS burden was calculated by multiplying 
nonsmoker's BOD with the PAF of SHS. Total BOD due to SHS was 44 143 DALYs with 
57% from males and 43% from females. The highest percentage of SHS burden was 
due to stroke. BOD was highest in the 50s age group in both genders. Years of 
life lost contributed major part of BOD due to all diseases. SHS burden in Korea 
in 2013 was the highest among the high-income Asia Pacific group countries. 
Effective intervention policies with more focus on vulnerable groups like adults 
in their 50s should be implemented to control SHS-related burden.

The obstruction of blood flow through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the 
right atrium may present as a severe clinical syndrome. One of the benign causes 
of SVC obstruction is the long-term use of indwelling catheters and wires, 
increasing the chances of SVC thrombosis. The treatment of the benign SVC 
syndrome is focused on achieving long-term durability and patency of the 
superior venocaval system and normal life expectancy. We report the successful 
surgical management of a patient with severe symptomatic SVC syndrome and 
emphasize technical details that might be of value in treating this challenging 
pathologic condition.

Comment in
    Am J Kidney Dis. 2017 Mar;69(3):328-330.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) use is low in the setting 
of stable symptomatic angina in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) despite high cardiovascular risk in this population, and PCI is frequently 
deferred out of concern for precipitating dialysis therapy. Whether this is 
appropriate is uncertain, and patient-centered data comparing the relative risks 
and benefits of continued medical therapy versus PCI in patients with advanced 
CKD and stable angina are scarce.
STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis.
SETTING & POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of individuals with advanced CKD 
(stages 4-5 with estimated glomerular filtration rates ≤ 20mL/min/1.73m2) and 
stable angina.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMELINE: A Markov model with a Monte Carlo simulation 
through 12 cycles, that is, 3 years of 3-month intervals, with 10,000 
microsimulations predicted mean quality-adjusted life-years.
INTERVENTION: PCI first, medical management, or dialysis (hemodialysis [HD]) 
followed by PCI.
OUTCOMES: Outcomes modeled were progression to HD therapy (for those not 
assigned to the preemptive HD strategy), catheter infection, and death.
RESULTS: Our analysis showed mean quality-adjusted life-years of 1.103 ± 0.69 
for PCI first, 1.088±0.70 for medical management, and 0.670±0.58 for HD followed 
by PCI. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found PCI as the preferred strategy > 
60% of the time.
LIMITATIONS: Values for probabilities and utilities were estimated and/or 
derived from multiple sources that were not uniform in their populations in 
terms of age, comorbid condition burden, and degree of kidney failure, and 
several simplifying assumptions were made.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that quality-adjusted life expectancy is 
similar for the PCI first and medical management strategies in patients with 
advanced CKD with stable angina and that the decision depends on patient 
preferences other than those incorporated in our model. Both strategies are 
superior to preemptive dialysis.

There is recent interest in using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to derive 
health state utility values, and results can differ from time tradeoff (TTO). 
Clearly, DCE is "choice based," whereas TTO is generally considered a "matching" 
task. We explore whether procedural adaptations to the TTO, which make the 
method more closely resemble a DCE, make TTO and choice converge. In particular, 
we test whether making the matching procedure in TTO less "transparent" to the 
respondent reduces disparities between TTO and DCE. We designed an interactive 
survey that was hosted on the Internet, and 2022 interviews were achieved in the 
United Kingdom in a representative sample of the population. We found a marked 
divergence between TTO and DCE, but this was not related to the "transparency" 
of the TTO procedure. We conclude that a difference in the error structure 
between TTO and choice and that factors other than differences in utility are 
affecting choices is driving the divergence. The latter has fundamental 
implications for the way choice data are analyzed and interpreted.

PURPOSE: Heart failure is a worldwide epidemic that is unlikely to change as the 
population ages and life expectancy increases. We sought to detail significant 
recent improvements to the Dassault Systèmes Living Heart Model (LHM) and use 
the LHM to compute left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myofiber 
stress distributions under the following 4 conditions: (1) normal cardiac 
function; (2) acute left heart failure (ALHF); (3) ALHF treated using an LV 
assist device (LVAD) flow rate of 2 L/min; and (4) ALHF treated using an LVAD 
flow rate of 4.5 L/min.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Incorporating improved systolic myocardial material 
properties in the LHM resulted in its ability to simulate the Frank-Starling law 
of the heart. We decreased myocardial contractility in the LV myocardium so that 
LV ejection fraction decreased from 56% to 28%. This caused mean LV end 
diastolic (ED) stress to increase to 508% of normal, mean LV end systolic (ES) 
stress to increase to 113% of normal, mean RV ED stress to decrease to 94% of 
normal and RV ES to increase to 570% of normal. When ALHF in the model was 
treated with an LVAD flow rate of 4.5 L/min, most stress results normalized. 
Mean LV ED stress became 85% of normal, mean LV ES stress became 109% of normal 
and mean RV ED stress became 95% of normal. However, mean RV ES stress improved 
less dramatically (to 342% of normal values).
CONCLUSIONS: These simulations strongly suggest that an LVAD is effective in 
normalizing LV stresses but not RV stresses that become elevated as a result of 
ALHF.

BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza infection is primarily caused by circulation of 
two influenza A strain subtypes and strains from two B lineages that vary each 
year. Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) contains only one of the two B-lineage 
strains, resulting in mismatches between vaccine strains and the predominant 
circulating B lineage. Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes both 
B-lineage strains. The objective was to estimate the cost-utility of introducing 
QIV to replace TIV in Germany.
METHODS: An individual-based dynamic transmission model (4Flu) using German data 
was used to provide realistic estimates of the impact of TIV and QIV on 
age-specific influenza infections. Cases were linked to health and economic 
outcomes to calculate the cost-utility of QIV versus TIV, from both a societal 
and payer perspective. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.0 and 1.5 % 
respectively, with 2014 as the base year. Univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Using QIV instead of TIV resulted in additional quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and cost savings from the societal perspective (i.e. it 
represents the dominant strategy) and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
of €14,461 per QALY from a healthcare payer perspective. In all univariate 
analyses, QIV remained cost-effective (ICUR <€50,000). In probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, QIV was cost-effective in >98 and >99 % of the simulations 
from the societal and payer perspective, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that QIV in Germany would provide additional 
health gains while being cost-saving to society or costing €14,461 per QALY 
gained from the healthcare payer perspective, compared with TIV.
