Burden of disease metrics are increasingly established to prioritize food safety 
interventions. We estimated the burden of disease caused by seven foodborne 
pathogens in Denmark in 2017: Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing 
Escherichia coli, norovirus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, 
and Toxoplasma gondii. We used public health surveillance data and scientific 
literature to estimate incidence, mortality, and total disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY) of each, and linked results with estimates of the proportion of 
disease burden that is attributable to foods. Our estimates showed that 
Campylobacter caused the highest burden of disease, leading to a total burden of 
1709 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1665-1755), more than threefold higher 
than the second highest ranked pathogen (Salmonella: 492 DALYs; 95% UI 481-504). 
Campylobacter still led the ranking when excluding DALYs attributable to 
nonfoodborne routes of exposure. The total estimated incidence was highest for 
norovirus, but this agent ranked sixth when focusing on foodborne burden. 
Salmonella ranked second in terms of foodborne burden of disease, followed by 
Listeria and Yersinia. Foodborne congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated to cause 
the loss of ∼100 years of healthy life, a burden that was borne by a low number 
of cases in the population. The ranking of foodborne pathogens varied 
substantially when based on reported cases, estimated incidence, and burden of 
disease estimates. Our results reinforce the need to continue food safety 
efforts throughout the food chain in Denmark, with a particular focus on 
reducing the incidence of Campylobacter infections.

Despite the critical influence of motivation on education and work outcomes, 
little is known about the motivations driving people to become and remain 
veterinarians. This qualitative study explored the career motivations stated by 
Australian veterinary graduates (n = 43) using a free-response Ten Statements 
Test (TST) at graduation, with follow-up interviews 6-8 months later (n = 10). 
TST responses were coded using an alternate inductive-deductive approach that 
tested their fit against existing theories of motivation. Results showed that 
the stated motivations were predominantly oriented to perceived value, rather 
than self-beliefs such as expectancy of success. About a quarter of the 
statements were animal-related, principally themed around intrinsic animal 
orientation (e.g., I like animals) or extrinsic animal-related purpose (e.g., I 
want to help animals). However, many non-animal themes also emerged, including 
both intrinsic (e.g., love of learning, challenge/problem solving, variety, 
social relatedness) and extrinsic (e.g., helping people, social contribution, 
career opportunity) motivations. Interview data revealed a motivational 
narrative of early formative influences, with some interviewees describing a 
later transition toward more people- or goal-oriented motivations. This 
exploratory study, outlining a broad taxonomy of veterinary career motivations 
and their alignment to self-determination theory in particular, may provide a 
useful framework for exploring career motivations in veterinary education.

The shortage of health care professionals is projected to worsen in the coming 
years. This is particularly concerning in underserved areas that are fraught 
with disparities in disease outcomes and life expectancy, quality of life, and 
health care access. The onus is on medical education institutions to train 
students to serve vulnerable communities to improve both health care access and 
the quality of medical school education. When health disparities are formally 
included in medical education curricula and the culture of medical education 
shifts to a community-based learning approach, patients and health care 
providers alike will reap the benefits.

PURPOSE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven safe and effective in 
preventing HIV among adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM), but the 
cost-effectiveness of PrEP in ASMM remains unknown. Building on a recent 
epidemiological network modeling study of PrEP among ASMM, we estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of PrEP use in a high prevalence U.S. setting with 
significant disparities in HIV between black and white ASMM.
METHODS: Based on the estimated number of infections averted and the number of 
ASMM on PrEP from the previous model and published estimates of PrEP costs, HIV 
treatment costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per infection 
prevented, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of PrEP use in black and white 
ASMM over 10 years using a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. 
Effectiveness was measured as lifetime QALYs gained. Cost estimates included 
10-year PrEP costs and lifetime HIV treatment costs saved. Cost-effectiveness 
was measured as cost/QALY gained. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed 
on key model input parameters and assumptions used.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, PrEP use yielded an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,064 per QALY in black ASMM and $427,788 per QALY 
in white ASMM. In all sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratio of PrEP 
use remained <$100,000 per QALY in black ASMM and >$100,000 per QALY in white 
ASMM.
CONCLUSIONS: We found favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for PrEP use among 
black ASMM or other ASMM in communities with high HIV burden at current PrEP 
costs. Clinicians providing services in high-prevalence communities, and 
particularly those serving high-prevalence communities of color, should consider 
including PrEP services.

Aspergillus fumigatus is the leading cause of invasive aspergillosis, which in 
immunocompromised patients results in a mortality rate as high as 90%. Earlier 
studies showed that HbxA is a global regulator in Aspergillus flavus affecting 
morphological development and secondary metabolism. Here, we determined its role 
in A. fumigatus, examining whether HbxA influences the regulation of asexual 
development, natural product biosynthesis, and virulence of this fungus. Our 
analysis demonstrated that removal of the hbxA gene caused a near-complete loss 
of conidial production in the mutant strain, as well as a slight reduction in 
colony growth. Other aspects of asexual development are affected, such as size 
and germination of conidia. Furthermore, we showed that in A. fumigatus, the 
loss of hbxA decreased the expression of the brlA central regulatory pathway 
involved in asexual development, as well as the expression of the "fluffy" genes 
flbB, flbD, and fluG HbxA was also found to regulate secondary metabolism, 
affecting the biosynthesis of multiple natural products, including 
fumigaclavines, fumiquinazolines, and chaetominine. In addition, using a 
neutropenic mouse infection model, hbxA was found to negatively impact the 
virulence of A. fumigatusIMPORTANCE The number of immunodepressed individuals is 
increasing, mainly due to the greater life expectancy in immunodepressed 
patients due to improvements in modern medical treatments. However, this 
population group is highly susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. This 
devastating illness, mainly caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, is 
associated with mortality rates reaching 90%. Treatment options for this disease 
are currently limited, and a better understanding of A. fumigatus genetic 
regulatory mechanisms is paramount for the design of new strategies to prevent 
or combat this infection. Our work provides new insight into the regulation of 
the development, metabolism, and virulence of this important opportunistic 
pathogen. The transcriptional regulatory gene hbxA has a profound effect on A. 
fumigatus biology, governing multiple aspects of conidial development. This is 
relevant since conidia are the main source of inoculum in Aspergillus 
infections. Importantly, hbxA also regulates the biosynthesis of secondary 
metabolites and the pathogenicity of this fungus.

The BRAFV600E mutation is the most prevalent genetic event in patients with 
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, no study has investigated the 
expression of PAQR3 in papillary thyroid tissues in relation to the BRAFV600E 
mutation and the clinicopathological features of PTC patients. Furthermore, the 
potential associations of the BRAFV600E mutation, PAQR3 expression and 
clinicopathological parameters in the cancerous tissues of PTC patients have not 
been investigated. This study was conducted on 60 patients with PTC who were 
treated surgically at our institution from 2017 to 2018. PCR was used to amplify 
DNA by the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method to detect 
BRAFV600E gene mutations. In addition, immunohistochemical techniques were 
utilized to assess PAQR3 expression in tumor tissue sections. The BRAFV600E 
mutation was associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM, p < 0.05) but not with 
other clinicopathological features. Low PAQR3 expression was associated with 
extrathyroidal extension and LNM (χ2 = 7.143, p = 0.009; χ2 = 6.459, p = 0.014, 
respectively). Furthermore, a statistically significant association was observed 
between chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and LNM (χ2 = 5.275, p = 0.0250). A 
linear relationship between the BRAFV600E mutation and PAQR3 protein expression 
has not been identified. These factors may be independent risk factors of 
extrathyroidal extension and LNM in PTC and be used to indicate the invasiveness 
of PTC tumors. Higher quality, multivariate analyses based on larger samples 
from around the world are urgently needed to further validate and revise our 
findings in the future.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease that is estimated 
to affect 22% of preweaned dairy calves in the United States and is a leading 
cause of preweaning mortality in dairy calves. Overall cost of calfhood BRD is 
reflected in both the immediate cost of treating the disease as well as lifetime 
decrease in production and increased likelihood of affected cattle leaving the 
herd before their second calving. The goal of this paper was to develop an 
estimate of the cost of BRD based on longitudinal treatment data from a study of 
BRD with a cohort of 11,470 preweaned dairy calves in California. Additionally, 
a cost-benefit analysis was performed for 2 different preventative measures for 
BRD, an increase of 0.47 L of milk per day for all calves or vaccination of all 
dams with a modified live BRD vaccine, using differing assumptions about birth 
rate and number of calves raised per year. Average short-term cost of BRD per 
affected calf was $42.15, including the use of anti-inflammatory medications in 
the treatment protocols across all management conditions. The cost of treating 
BRD in calves appears to have increased in recent years and is greater than 
costs presented in previous studies. A cost-benefit analysis examined different 
herd scenarios for a range of cumulative incidences of BRD from 3 to 25%. 
Increasing milk fed was financially beneficial in all scenarios above a 3% 
cumulative incidence of BRD. Use of a modified live vaccine in dams during 
pregnancy, examining only its value as a form of BRD prevention in the calves 
raised on the farm, was financially beneficial only if the cumulative incidence 
of BRD exceeded 10 to 15% depending on the herd size and whether the dairy farm 
was raising any bull calves. The cost-benefit analysis, under the conditions 
studied, suggests that producers with high rates of BRD may benefit financially 
from implementing preventative measures, whereas these preventative measures may 
not be cost effective to implement on dairy farms with very low cumulative 
incidences of BRD. The long-term costs of calfhood BRD on lifetime productivity 
were not factored into these calculations, and the reduction in disease may be 
associated with additional cost savings and an improvement in calf welfare and 
herd life.

OBJECTIVES: Aging is not just a consequence of wear-and-tear, but it is the 
inappropriate regenerative mechanism of the stem cells. Aging is directly 
proportional to increase in health-problems involving all organs and 
physiological systems - more of non-communicable types. On the other hand, 
medical advancement and awareness about health-care are increasing the life 
expectancy, which could outnumber the young generation or the mainstream of 
work-force gradually. Hence, understanding of disease-prevalence is essential 
with a view to making necessary medical, environmental and economic arrangements 
and offering holistic care to the older population.
STUDY DESIGN: Records of medical consultancies of outpatient departments (OPD) 
were retrieved from the hospital database and considered for understanding the 
disease-prevalence in the geriatric population.
METHODS: Over 47000 subjects of 60 years and above were categorized into eight 
age-groups and analyzed for age-related disease-prevalence in both males and 
females.
RESULTS: Approximately 25% were affected with cardiovascular system followed by 
20% with general complication of cold/cough/fever and GI-disorientation. A 
uniform damage was observed in systems such as gastro-/neuro-/nephro-/ophthalmic 
and urology in both genders. Males were more prone to cardiac, nephorologic and 
urologic problems whereas females were more affected with musculo-skeletal 
problems than men. In general, men were more affected with geriatric diseases.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular disorder after 60 years onwards could be related to 
stress for transition from 'income-to-no-income' state and lack of financial and 
other preparedness. Significant osteoarthritis problem in females is undoubtedly 
associated with ageing of ovaries. An intensive medical intervention following 
hospital-admission and outcome will guide for building age-friendly, long-stay 
and isolated accommodation, which could be considered for low- and middle-income 
countries as a model for handling geriatric disease burden.

BACKGROUND: Through a comprehensive analysis of Italy's estimates from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we aimed 
to understand the patterns of health loss and response of the health-care 
system, and offer evidence-based policy indications in light of the demographic 
transition and government health spending in the country.
METHODS: Estimates for Italy were extracted from GBD 2017. Data on Italy are 
presented for 1990 and 2017, on prevalence, causes of death, years of life lost, 
years lived with disability, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life 
expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, healthy life expectancy, and Healthcare 
Access and Quality (HAQ) Index. We compared the estimates for Italy with those 
of 15 other western European countries.
FINDINGS: The quality of the universal health system and healthy behaviours 
contribute to favourable overall health, even in comparison with other western 
European countries. In 2017, life expectancy and HAQ Index score in Italy were 
among the highest globally, with life expectancy at birth reaching 85·3 years 
for females and 80·8 for males in 2017, ranking Italy eighth globally for 
females and sixth for males, and an HAQ Index score of 94·9 in 2016 compared 
with 81·54 in 1990, keeping Italy ranked as ninth globally. Between 1990 and 
2017 age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases decreased by 53·7% 
(95% uncertainty interval -56·1 to -51·4), for neoplasms decreased by 28·2% 
(-32·3 to -24·6), and for transport injuries decreased by 62·1% (-64·6 to 
-59·2). However, population ageing is causing an increase in the burden of 
specific diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (DALYs 
increased by 77·9% [68·4 to 87·2]) and pancreatic (DALYs increased by 39·7% 
[28·4 to 51·7]) and uterine cancers (DALYs increased by 164·7% [129·7 to 
202·5]). Behavioural risk factors, which are potentially modifiable, still have 
a strong effect, particularly on cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. For 
instance, in 2017, 44 400 (41 200 to 47 800) cancer deaths were attributed to 
smoking, 12 000 (9600 to 14 800) to alcohol use, and 9500 (5400 to 14 200) to 
high body-mass index, while 47 000 (31 100 to 65 700) deaths due to 
cardiovascular diseases could be attributed to high LDL cholesterol, 28 700 
(19 700 to 38 500) to diets low in whole grains, and 15 900 (8500 to 24 900) to 
low physical activity.
INTERPRETATION: Italy provides an interesting example of the results that can be 
achieved by a mix of relatively healthy lifestyles and a universal health 
system. Two main issues require attention, population ageing and gradual 
decrease of public health financing, which both pose several challenges to the 
future of Italy's health status. Our findings should be useful to Italy's policy 
makers and health system experts elsewhere.

BACKGROUND: The Nordic countries have commonalities in gender equality, economy, 
welfare, and health care, but differ in culture and lifestyle, which might 
create country-wise health differences. This study compared life expectancy, 
disease burden, and risk factors in the Nordic region.
METHODS: Life expectancy in years and age-standardised rates of overall, 
cause-specific, and risk factor-specific estimates of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) were analysed in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. Data were extracted for Denmark, Finland, 
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (ie, the Nordic countries), and Greenland, an 
autonomous area of Denmark. Estimates were compared with global, high-income 
region, and Nordic regional estimates, including Greenland.
FINDINGS: All Nordic countries exceeded the global life expectancy; in 2017, the 
highest life expectancy was in Iceland among females (85·9 years [95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 85·5-86·4] vs 75·6 years [75·3-75·9] globally) and 
Sweden among males (80·8 years [80·2-81·4] vs 70·5 years [70·1-70·8] globally). 
Females (82·7 years [81·9-83·4]) and males (78·8 years [78·1-79·5]) in Denmark 
and males in Finland (78·6 years [77·8-79·2]) had lower life expectancy than in 
the other Nordic countries. The lowest life expectancy in the Nordic region was 
in Greenland (females 77·2 years [76·2-78·0], males 70·8 years [70·3-71·4]). 
Overall disease burden was lower in the Nordic countries than globally, with the 
lowest age-standardised DALY rates among Swedish males (18 555·7 DALYs [95% UI 
15 968·6-21 426·8] per 100 000 population vs 35 834·3 DALYs [33 218·2-38 740·7] 
globally) and Icelandic females (16 074·1 DALYs [13 216·4-19 240·8] vs 29 934·6 
DALYs [26 981·9-33 211·2] globally). Greenland had substantially higher DALY 
rates (26 666·6 DALYs [23 478·4-30 218·8] among females, 33 101·3 DALYs 
[30 182·3-36 218·6] among males) than the Nordic countries. Country variation 
was primarily due to differences in causes that largely contributed to DALYs 
through mortality, such as ischaemic heart disease. These causes dominated male 
disease burden, whereas non-fatal causes such as low back pain were important 
for female disease burden. Smoking and metabolic risk factors were high-ranking 
risk factors across all countries. DALYs attributable to alcohol use and smoking 
were particularly high among the Danes, as was alcohol use among Finnish males.
INTERPRETATION: Risk factor differences might drive differences in life 
expectancy and disease burden that merit attention also in high-income settings 
such as the Nordic countries. Special attention should be given to the high 
disease burden in Greenland.

BACKGROUND: The incidence rate of hip fractures seems to be declining in many 
western countries. However, due to the ageing of the population, the number of 
fractures may still be on the rise. No papers so far have quantified the future 
burden of hip fractures in terms of both health loss (as measured in disability 
adjusted life years DALY) and costs. The purpose of this paper is to assess the 
future health and economic burden of hip fractures.
METHODS: We collected population projections from Statistics Norway up until the 
year 2040. The medium projection was used for the base case analysis. Fracture 
rates for 2008 were estimated based on information from the Norwegian 
Epidemiologic Osteoporosis Studies (NOREPOS) hip fracture database (NORHip), 
which includes information about all hip fractures in Norway. Future fracture 
rate was assumed to decline by 0.7% per year in the base case. We used the same 
assumptions as the global burden of disease project on years of remaining life 
and disability weights. Cost of hip fracture was based on the published 
literature. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of changing 
underlying assumptions on demographic change, development in hip fracture rate, 
assumed life expectancy and choice of disability weights.
RESULTS: Assuming a medium population growth and a continued decline in fracture 
rate, our estimates indicate that health lost to hip fractures will 
approximately double, from 32,850 DALYs in 2020 to 60,555 in 2040. Over the same 
period, costs are estimated to increase by 65%. Sensitivity analyses indicate 
that estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions on both population growth, 
fracture rate development, disability weights and assumed life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The burden of hip fractures in terms of DALYs lost and cost incurred 
is likely to increase even if the fracture rate continues to decline.

Lay health workers have been utilized to deliver health promotion programmes in 
a variety of settings. However, few studies have sought to determine whether 
these programmes represent value for money, particularly in a UK context. The 
present study involved an economic evaluation of Wellbeing for Life, an 
integrated health and wellbeing service in northern England. The service 
combined one-to-one interventions delivered by lay health workers (known as 
health trainers), group wellbeing interventions, volunteering opportunities and 
other community development activities. Value for money was assessed using an 
established economic model developed with input from a panel of commissioners 
and providers, and the main data source was the national health trainer data 
collection and reporting system. Between June 2015 and January 2017, behaviour 
change outcomes (i.e. whether client goals in relation to diet, physical 
activity, smoking or other behaviours, had been achieved) were recorded for 2433 
of the 3179 individuals who accessed one-to-one interventions. The level of 
achievement observed gave an estimated total health gain of 287.7 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In addition, there were 4669 
health-promoting events, five asset mapping projects and 1595 occurrences of 
signposting to other services. Combining the value of individual behaviour 
change with the value of these additional activities gave an overall net cost 
per QALY gained of £3900 and a total estimated societal value of at least £3.45 
for every £1 spent on the service. These results suggest that the Wellbeing for 
Life service offered good value for money. Further research is needed to 
systematically and comprehensively determine the societal value of similar 
holistic, asset-based and lay-led approaches.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of routine second TUR on the long-term outcome 
of patients with newly diagnosed stage pT1 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC) MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 210 patients (mean age 62.1 years, 
89.5% were males) with stage pT1 NMIBC who underwent first TUR were 
prospectively randomized into two groups including second TUR (n = 105) and no 
second TUR (n = 105) groups. Data on recurrence, disease progression, 7-year and 
10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) were recorded.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 119 months (IQR 65-168). Per-protocol 
(PP) analysis revealed that compared to patients without second TUR, patients 
with second TUR had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for 
RFS (59.4%, 57.9% and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7% and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) 
and PFS (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, 
p < 0.001). According to PP and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the 10-year 
OS rate was significantly higher in patients with second TUR (59.1 vs. 40.8%, 
p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that undergoing second TUR (OR 1.661, 
95% CI 1.156-2.385, p = 0.006) was an independent determinant of prolonged OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these findings indicate the prognostic value of 
second TUR in stage pT1 NMIBC patients, not only for RFS and PFS advantages but 
also for the long-term OS advantage. Therefore, second TUR should be routinely 
performed in all stage pT1 NMIBC patients with life expectancy of at least 
10 years, given the positive contribution to all oncological outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The use of the bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITAs) during 
myocardial revascularization reportedly provides a survival benefit over using a 
single internal thoracic artery (SITA). However, the advantages in chronic 
hemodialysis patients, who generally have multiple comorbidities, is unclear.
METHODS: Outcomes of chronic hemodialysis patients who underwent isolated 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using a SITA with additional saphenous 
vein grafts (SVGs) (n = 33) or BITAs (n = 30) for left-side revascularization 
were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: With the exception of the rate of diabetes mellitus (SITA vs. BITA: 
84.8% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.003), the two groups showed similar patient 
characteristics. Using the off-pump technique, revascularization was completed 
without manipulation of the ascending aorta in 45.7% of patients in the BITA 
group, whereas all patients in the SITA group required aortic manipulation 
(p < 0.001). Of note, the incidence of extensive aortic calcification (>50% of 
ascending aorta circumference) was not uncommon (14.3%). The in-hospital 
mortality (3.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.336) and complication rates (including deep wound 
infection, re-exploration and stroke) were similar in both groups. The 5-year 
estimated survival rates for freedom from overall death in the SITA and BITA 
groups were 42.4% and. 57.4%, respectively (p = 0.202).
CONCLUSIONS: BITA grafting was able to achieve revascularization with minimal 
manipulation of the diseased ascending aorta without increasing the complication 
rate. The long-term survival benefit of BITA grafting, however, was unclear in 
dialysis patients, especially because such patients have a relatively short life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment goals and ambitions have even been upwardly revised 
since demonstration was made that under certain conditions, treatment-free 
remission was possible. Herein, we will discuss on how to try tailoring 
treatment choices to the unique characteristics of each patient.
RECENT FINDINGS: Since the first-generation ATP-competitive TKI imatinib was 
made available in the clinic in 2001, second-generation drugs such as dasatinib, 
nilotinib and bosutinib and the third-generation TKI ponatinib have broadened 
the therapeutic armamentarium, providing effective salvage against intolerance 
and different types of resistance, or as frontline options. Management and 
outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia have been revolutionized by 
the discovery, development, and approval of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs). Most patients can now expect a near-to normal life expectancy and 
acceptable quality of life on life-long treatment, providing awareness and 
avoidance of harmful adverse events, which depend on each TKI safety profile and 
patient personal background.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the major causes of mortality in the world, 
with high human and financial burdens on communities. Telemedicine is a tool for 
providing services for patients that are difficult to access or in need of 
immediate care. The aim of this study was to systematically review economic 
evaluation studies that compared telemedicine with usual care for cardiovascular 
patients. A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and related articles 
published up to December 2018 were searched in different databases (PubMed, 
Embase, SCOPUS, Global Health, Google Scholar, Magiran, SID). The articles were 
selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consolidated health economic 
evaluation reporting standards statement checklist was used to qualitatively 
evaluate the papers. Overall, 20 articles were included in the study. The 
studies used quality-adjusted life years to measure outcomes. The highest and 
lowest values of Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio were $515,082 and $2099 
that had been reported in the UK and New Zealand, respectively. Most of the 
items of the checklist were reported and the quality of most of the studies was 
excellent and very good. According to the results, telemedicine improves the 
clinical outcomes and results in considerable saving in costs. Utilizing 
telemedicine concurrent with the usual care for service delivery is more 
cost-effective. The reviewed studies had been conducted in high-income 
countries, hence, it is essential to be cautious when generalizing the results 
and applying them in health systems policymaking.

Introduction: An increasing number of patients is diagnosed with spinal 
metastases due to elevated cancer incidence and improved overall survival. 
Patients with symptomatic spinal bone metastases often receive radiotherapy with 
or without surgical stabilisation. Patients with a life expectancy of less than 
3 months are generally deemed unfit for surgery, therefore adequate 
pre-treatment assessment of life expectancy is necessary. The aim of this study 
was to assess new factors associated with overall survival for this category of 
patients.Patients and methods: Patients who received radiotherapy for thoracic 
or lumbar spinal metastases from June 2013 to December 2016 were included in 
this study. The pre-treatment planning CT for radiotherapy treatment was used to 
assess the patient's visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, total muscle area 
and skeletal muscle density on a single transverse slice at the L3 level. The 
total muscle area was used to assess sarcopenia. Furthermore, data were 
collected on age, sex, primary tumour, Karnofsky performance score, medical 
history, number of bone metastases, non-bone metastases and neurological 
symptoms. Univariable and multivariable cox regressions were performed to 
determine the association between our variables of interest and the survival at 
90 and 365 days.Results: A total of 310 patients was included. The median age 
was 67 years. Overall survival rates for 90 and 365 days were 71% and 36% 
respectively. For 90- and 365-day survival, the Karnofsky performance score, 
muscle density and primary tumour were independently significantly associated. 
The visceral or subcutaneous fat area and their ratio and sarcopenia were not 
independently associated with overall survival.Conclusions: Of the body 
morphology, only muscle density was statistically significant associated with 
overall survival after 90 and 365 days in patients with spinal bone metastases. 
Body fat distribution was not significantly associated with overall survival.

The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of Pb at 96 h were 8.84, 192.14, and 
3.22 mg L-1 for pre-reproductive and reproductive individuals of Lamellidens 
jenkinsianus obesa and reproductive individuals of Parreysia (Parreysia) 
corrugata, respectively. Thus, young L. j. obesa were much more sensitive to Pb 
than its adults, while P. (P.) corrugata was the most sensitive. However, all 
the three values were much higher than the Pb levels commonly found in natural 
waters, and indicative of the tolerance of these mollusks to acute, short-term 
Pb exposure. In contrary to these findings, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
catalase (CAT) activities were affected and lipid peroxidation (LPO) elevated in 
young L. j. obesa and P. (P.) corrugata in 21-day sublethal toxicity tests at 
26-68 ppb Pb concentrations, which might be considered environmentally 
realistic. Some behavioral patterns such as number of movement (Mov) and 
durations of foot mobilization together with siphon extensions (FSE) were 
reduced, and the durations of valves remaining completely closed without any 
extension of foot and siphons (VC) increased significantly at 25-69 ppb Pb as 
well. Thus, the study revealed significant interspecific differences as well as 
that between life stages of the same species, suggesting that apparently hardy 
species could be impacted by low Pb concentrations in their young stages. 
Further, a multi-biomarker approach involving biological effects, anti-oxidative 
enzyme activity and easy-to-measure behavioral elements could comprise a 
valuable tool in assessment of Pb-induced stress in freshwater bivalves.
