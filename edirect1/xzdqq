CONTEXT: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common 
extrapulmonary complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). Approximately 40% of people 
with CF who are older than 20 years have CFRD. Presence of CFRD is associated 
with poor health outcomes in people with CF.
OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes current knowledge on pathophysiology of CFRD.
METHODS: A PubMed review of the literature was conducted, with search terms that 
included CFRD, cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis related diabetes, and cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Additional sources were 
identified through manual searches of reference lists. Pathophysiology of CFRD: 
The pathophysiology underlying development of glucose tolerance abnormalities in 
CF is complex and not fully understood. β-cell loss and functional impairment of 
the remaining β-cell function results in progressive insulin insufficiency. 
Factors that may contribute to development of CFRD include local islet and 
systemic inflammation, alterations in the incretion hormone axis, varying 
degrees of insulin resistance and genetic factors related to type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CFRD is expected to further increase with 
improving life expectancy of people with CF. Further research is needed to 
better understand the mechanisms underlying the development of CFRD and the 
impact of diabetes on clinical outcomes in CF.

INTRODUCTION: Excessive sodium consumption is associated with increased blood 
pressure, which is an important risk factor for non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs). This study therefore aimed to describe the burden of NCDs attributable 
to excessive sodium consumption among Brazilians.
METHODS: This observational study used mortality and Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (DALY) rates, and their respective uncertainty intervals (UI), from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019). The burden was obtained by the 
population attributable fraction of each NCD, considering the minimum 
theoretical value of risk (intake of 0-3g of sodium/day); the excessive 
consumption proportion in the population, obtained through population inquiries; 
and the relative risks obtained through meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Excessive sodium consumption was the third highest dietary risk 
contributing to deaths (30,814; 95% UI = 2,034 - 84,130) and DALYs (699,119; 95% 
UI= 43,130 - 1,914,066) in 2019. States from the Northeast region had the 
highest age-standardized rates of deaths and DALYs, and the male population was 
more affected by NCDs caused by excessive sodium consumption. Cardiovascular 
diseases were the main contributing factors in the burden attributable to 
excessive sodium consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the progress in addressing NCDs related to this risk 
factor, the impact remains high, especially among men and in the Northeast 
region. More effective measures are needed to reduce sodium in industrialized 
products, such as health promotion actions to combat sodium consumption, in 
order to prevent and control NCDs in Brazil.

INTRODUCTION: To better understand trends in the main cause of death in Brazil, 
we sought to analyze the burden of cardiovascular risk factors (RF) and 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) attributable to specific RFs in Brazil from 1990 
to 2019, using the estimates from the GBD 2019 study.
METHODS: To estimate RF exposure, the Summary Exposure Value (SEV) was used, 
whereas for disease burden attributed to RF, mortality and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALY) due to CVD were used. For comparisons over time and between 
states, we compared age-standardized rates. The sociodemographic index (SDI) was 
used as a marker of socioeconomic conditions.
RESULTS: In 2019, 83% of CVD mortality in Brazil was attributable to RF. For 
SEV, there was a reduction in smoking and environmental RF, but an increase in 
metabolic RF. High systolic blood pressure and dietary risks continue to be the 
main RF for CVD mortality and DALY. While there was a decline in 
age-standardized mortality rates attributable to the evaluated RF, there was 
also a stability or increase in crude mortality rates, with the exception of 
smoking. It is important to highlight the increase in the risk of death 
attributable to a high body mass index. Regarding the analysis per state, SEVs 
and mortality attributable to RF were higher in those states with lower SDIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the reduction in CVD mortality and DALY rates attributable 
to RF, the stability or increase in crude rates attributable to metabolic RFs is 
worrisome, requiring investments and a renewal of health policies.

INTRODUCTION: An unhealthy diet is a modifiable risk factor for non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs), one of the most important public health problems in Brazil. 
This study aimed to analyze the burden of NCDs attributable to dietary risks in 
Brazil between 1990-2019.
METHODS: Secondary data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were used to 
estimate the burden attributable to fifteen dietary risks in Brazil. The main 
sources of data for Brazil were national surveys and international databases. A 
comparative risk assessment was used to obtain the population attributable 
fraction. We described the intake of each dietary risk and the distribution of 
number and rates of deaths and Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
attributable to diet by sex, age, state, and year from 1990-2019.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms were the main 
NCDs attributable to an unhealthy diet. Age-standardized mortality and DALYs 
rates attributable to unhealthy diet decreased between 1990-2019 (-51.5% and 
-48.8, respectively). Diet high in red meat and sodium, and low in whole grains 
were the three main risk factors contributing to the burden of NCDs both in 1990 
and 2019. The burden of NCDs was higher among males in the middle-aged 
population (around 50 years), as well as in the states of Maranhão, Rio de 
Janeiro, and Alagoas.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a suboptimum diet among the Brazilian 
population. The major contributors to this burden were diet high in red meat and 
sodium and low in whole grains. This study supports priorities in public 
policies on food and nutrition to reduce the burden of NCDs.

INTRODUCTION: Aggression against women is an important cause of morbidity and 
death. This study compares the variation of deaths and years of life lost to 
death or disability (DALY) caused by interpersonal violence against women in 
Brazil and its states.
METHODS: This descriptive study analyzed estimates from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) referring to interpersonal violence against women, aged 15 
to 49 years, examining the mortality and DALY rates for Brazil and its states, 
in 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: In this study, 3,168 deaths of women between 15 and 49 years of age, 
caused by interpersonal violence, were estimated in 1990, and 4,262 in 2019, 
which represents an increase of 33.8%. Regardless of the Maria da Penha Law and 
the progress in policies for curbing violence against women, one can observe a 
stability in the mortality and DALY rates in most of the Brazilian states. Only 
Bahia had a significant increase in those rates, while Federal District, Rio de 
Janeiro, and São Paulo showed a significant decline.
CONCLUSIONS: The rates of female homicide have remained stable when comparing 
1990 and 2019. Although there were improvements in terms of women's rights in 
the early 2000's, the chauvinist and conservative society of Brazil has not been 
able to protect women, and the country might not reach the targets established 
by the UN's 2030 Agenda.

Sleeping enough is associated with a reduced risk of mortality and dementia. New 
evidence support regular physical exercise, including at home, as a corner stone 
intervention to prevent falls and fractures. In contrast, supplementation with 
high doses of vitamin D is ineffective and even deleterious in this indication 
and a routine screening in asymptomatic adults is not recommended. Several 
studies illustrate our difficulties in prescribing and deprescribing in frail 
older patients and a study suggests that statins in cardiovascular primary 
prevention should considered only when a patient's life expectancy exceeds 2.5 
years. Finally, several studies have fueled the debate about screening for 
hearing impairment.

hautes doses de vitamine D n’est pas efficace, voire délétère, dans cette

difficultés à prescrire et déprescrire, chez les patients âgés fragiles, et une

primaire ne se justifie que si l’espérance de vie du patient dépasse 2,5 ans. 
Finalement, plusieurs études sont venues nourrir le débat sur le dépistage de la

warming.

For marine ectotherms, larval success, planktonic larval duration and dispersal 
trajectories are strongly influenced by temperature, and therefore, ocean 
warming and heatwaves have profound impacts on these sensitive stages. Warming, 
through increased poleward flow in regions with western boundary currents, such 
as the East Australia Current (EAC), provides opportunities for range extension 
as propagules track preferred conditions. Two sea urchin species, 
Centrostephanus rodgersii and Heliocidaris tuberculata, sympatric in the EAC 
warming hotspot, exhibit contrasting responses to warming. Over half a century, 
C. rodgersii has undergone marked poleward range extension, but the range of H. 
tuberculata has not changed. We constructed thermal performance curves (TPC) to 
determine if contrasting developmental thermal tolerance can explain this 
difference. The temperatures tested encompassed present-day distribution and 
forecast ocean warming/heatwave conditions. The broad and narrow thermal optimum 
(Topt) ranges for C. rodgersii and H. tuberculata larvae (7.2 and 4.7°C range, 
respectively) matched their realized (adult distribution) thermal niches. The 
cool and warm temperatures for 50% development to the feeding larva approximated 
temperatures at adult poleward range limits. Larval cool tolerances with respect 
to mean local temperature differed, 6.0 and 3.8°C respectively. Larval warm 
tolerances were similar for both species as are the adult warm range edges. The 
larvae of both species would be sensitive to heatwaves. Centrostephanus 
rodgersii has stayed in place and shifted in space, likely due to its broad 
cold-warm larval thermal tolerance and large thermal safety margins. Phenotypic 
plasticity of the planktonic stage of C. rodgersii facilitated its range 
extension. In contrast, larval cold intolerance of H. tuberculata explains its 
restricted range and will delay poleward extension as the region warms. In a 
warming ocean, we show that intrinsic thermal biology traits of the pelagic 
stage provide an integrative tool to explain species-specific variation in range 
shift patterns.

Bioconjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is important for protein drug 
development as it has improved biological stability. In contrast, proteins 
including PEGylated ones are susceptible to physicochemical stresses. 
Particularly, protein drugs in solution may form aggregates or subvisible 
particles if they are exposed to dropping stress during transportation. However, 
many PEGylation studies have focused on its usefulness, such as the extension of 
half-life in blood, and changes in the physical properties or biological 
responses of PEGylated proteins under dropping stress remain unexplored. Here, 
we prepared four PEGylated ovalbumin (PEG-OVA) molecules conjugated with 
different lengths (5 or 20 kDa) and numbers (large [L] or small [S]) of PEG, 
analyzed the formation of subvisible particles under dropping stress, and 
examined their impact on antibody production and clearance. Under dropping 
stress, the aggregated particle concentration of 20 kDa PEG-OVA (S) and (L) 
solutions was approximately 3-fold that of the OVA solution. Moreover, 
administration of 20 kDa PEG-OVA with dropping stress induced anti-PEG antibody 
production and clearance of PEG-OVA. As a mechanism, dropping stress could 
enhance the uptake of 20 kDa PEG-OVA (L) by macrophages. These findings could 
provide insights into proper transportation conditions to ensure the quality of 
PEGylated protein drugs.

INTRODUCTION: Despite seasonal influenza vaccination programmes in most 
countries targeting individuals aged ≥ 65 (or ≥ 55) years and high risk-groups, 
significant disease burden remains. We explored the impact and 
cost-effectiveness of 27 vaccination programmes targeting the elderly and/or 
children in eight European settings (n = 205.8 million).
METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission model to infer age- and 
(sub-)type-specific seasonal influenza virus infections calibrated to England, 
France, Ireland, Navarra, The Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain between 
2010/11 and 2017/18. The base-case vaccination scenario consisted of 
non-adjuvanted, non-high dose trivalent vaccines (TV) and no universal 
paediatric vaccination. We explored i) moving the elderly to "improved" (i.e., 
adjuvanted or high-dose) trivalent vaccines (iTV) or non-adjuvanted 
non-high-dose quadrivalent vaccines (QV); ii) adopting mass paediatric 
vaccination with TV or QV; and iii) combining the elderly and paediatric 
strategies. We estimated setting-specific costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained from the healthcare perspective, and discounted QALYs at 3.0%.
RESULTS: In the elderly, the estimated numbers of infection per 100,000 
population are reduced by a median of 261.5 (range across settings: 154.4, 
475.7) when moving the elderly to iTV and by 150.8 (77.6, 262.3) when moving 
them to QV. Through indirect protection, adopting mass paediatric programmes 
with 25% uptake achieves similar reductions in the elderly of 233.6 using TV 
(range: 58.9, 425.6) or 266.5 using QV (65.7, 477.9), with substantial health 
gains from averted infections across ages. At €35,000/QALY gained, moving the 
elderly to iTV plus adopting mass paediatric QV programmes provides the highest 
mean net benefits and probabilities of being cost-effective in all settings and 
paediatric coverage levels.
CONCLUSION: Given the direct and indirect protection, and depending on the 
vaccine prices, model results support a combination of having moved the elderly 
to an improved vaccine and adopting universal paediatric vaccination programmes 
across the European settings.

The Dog Aging Project is a long-term longitudinal study of ageing in tens of 
thousands of companion dogs. The domestic dog is among the most variable mammal 
species in terms of morphology, behaviour, risk of age-related disease and life 
expectancy. Given that dogs share the human environment and have a sophisticated 
healthcare system but are much shorter-lived than people, they offer a unique 
opportunity to identify the genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors 
associated with healthy lifespan. To take advantage of this opportunity, the Dog 
Aging Project will collect extensive survey data, environmental information, 
electronic veterinary medical records, genome-wide sequence information, 
clinicopathology and molecular phenotypes derived from blood cells, plasma and 
faecal samples. Here, we describe the specific goals and design of the Dog Aging 
Project and discuss the potential for this open-data, community science study to 
greatly enhance understanding of ageing in a genetically variable, socially 
relevant species living in a complex environment.

There is a scarcity of literature available regarding the factors affecting life 
expectancy in bone metastasis (BM). Our objective is to evaluate the factors 
affecting life expectancy in adult patients with BM. In this prospective cohort 
study for over 5 years, 111 adults with BM were included in the analysis. The 
life expectancy was calculated from the time of diagnosis of BM to death. 
Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS statistical program. The Pearson 
chi-square test was used to analyze the significance and life expectancy was 
represented on the Kaplan Meier curve. The overall median survival time was 
9 months. The patients with a primary malignancy detected along with BM had a 
median survival of 9 months. Those without a known primary at the time of 
diagnosis survived for a median period of 8 months and those with known primary 
for 14 months (P-value 0.01). The median survival of patients with BM from the 
lung, breast, and prostate was 6, 14, and 24 months, respectively (P-value 
0.001). Only 22% of patients with extraskeletal metastasis in addition to BM 
survived more than 6 months (P-value 0.013). Patients with neurological deficits 
had a median survival of 2 months (P-value 0.0001). There was no statistically 
significant association between gender and the mode of treatment and survival. 
There was a significant association between life expectancy and mode of 
presentation, the primary site of origin, presence of extraskeletal secondary, 
BM with unknown primary, and symptoms on presentation in patients with BM.

University, Kyoto, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: The extension of healthy life expectancy is an important policy 
issue in Japan. This study aimed to clarify the association between subjective 
health and healthy life expectancy and identify the factors that improve 
subjective health of child-rearing-aged adults in Japan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. We used data from 2718 
participants of the Japanese General Social Survey 2009 Life Course Study. The 
mean age was 35.5 ± 4.10 years, and 56% were female. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was performed on subjective health, which was treated as a 
binary variable when calculating healthy life expectancy as an objective 
variable. The predictors were gender, age, marital status, number of family 
members living in the home, household income, mental health score, age of 
youngest child, and the person from whom one seeks help. The prefecture where 
the participants resided was treated as a control variable.
RESULTS: There was no association between individual subjective health and 
healthy life expectancy. Mental health score (measured by the Mental Health 
Inventory-5, MHI-5) was significantly associated with subjective health. With a 
MHI-5 score of ⩽ 10 points as the reference criterion, as the score increased, 
the odds ratio of subjective health increased, and for MHI-5 scores ⩾ 16 points, 
odds ratio was 14.14 (confidence interval: 7.57-26.38).
CONCLUSION: Among the child-rearing-aged adults, prefectural healthy life 
expectancy was not associated with individual subjective health. Mental health 
was significantly associated with subjective health and may be underestimated in 
calculating healthy life expectancy.

Micrococcal Nuclease stimulates Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation in a 
Murine Implant Infection Model.

Advancements in contemporary medicine have led to an increasing life expectancy 
which has broadened the application of biomaterial implants. As each implant 
procedure has an innate risk of infection, the number of biomaterial-associated 
infections keeps rising. Staphylococcus aureus causes 34% of such infections and 
is known as a potent biofilm producer. By secreting micrococcal nuclease S. 
aureus is able to escape neutrophil extracellular traps by cleaving their 
DNA-backbone. Also, micrococcal nuclease potentially limits biofilm growth and 
adhesion by cleaving extracellular DNA, an important constituent of biofilms. 
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of micrococcal nuclease on infection 
persistence and biofilm formation in a murine biomaterial-associated 
infection-model with polyvinylidene-fluoride mesh implants inoculated with 
bioluminescent S. aureus or its isogenic micrococcal nuclease deficient mutant. 
Supported by results based on in-vivo bioluminescence imaging, ex-vivo colony 
forming unit counts, and histological analysis it was found that production of 
micrococcal nuclease enables S. aureus bacteria to evade the immune response 
around an implant resulting in a persistent infection. As a novel finding, 
histological analysis provided clear indications that the production of 
micrococcal nuclease stimulates S. aureus to form biofilms, the presence of 
which extended neutrophil extracellular trap formation up to 13 days after mesh 
implantation. Since micrococcal nuclease production appeared vital for the 
persistence of S. aureus biomaterial-associated infection, targeting its 
production could be a novel strategy in preventing biomaterial-associated 
infection.

Animals have adapted behavioral and physiological strategies to conserve energy 
during periods of adverse conditions. Hepatic glucose is one such adaptation 
used by grazing animals. While large vertebrates have been shown to have feed 
utilization and deposition of nutrients-fluctuations in metabolic rate-little is 
known about the regulating mechanism that controls hepatic metabolism in yaks 
under grazing conditions in the cold season. Hence, the objective of this 
research was to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data to better 
understand how the hepatic responds to chronic nutrient stress. Our analyses 
indicated that the blood parameters related to energy metabolism (glucose, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, lipoprotein lipase, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1) were 
significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the cold season. The RNA-Seq results showed 
that malnutrition inhibited lipid synthesis (particularly fatty acid, 
cholesterol, and steroid synthesis), fatty acid oxidation, and lipid catabolism 
and promoted gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. For metabolite profiles, 359 
metabolites were significantly altered in two groups. Interestingly, the cold 
season group remarkably decreased glutathione and phosphatidylcholine (18:2 (2E, 
4E)/0:0). Moreover, integrative analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome 
demonstrated that glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, PPAR signaling pathway, fatty 
acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism play an 
important role in the potential relationship between differential expression 
genes and metabolites. The reduced lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and 
fat catabolism facilitated gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the PPAR and PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathways to maintain the energy homeostasis of the whole body in the 
yak, thereby coping with the shortage of forages and adapting to the extreme 
environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).

Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the 
dysregulation of the Rat Sarcoma/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) 
pathway and characterized by short stature, heart defects, pectus excavatum, 
webbed neck, learning disabilities, cryptorchidism, and facial dysmorphia. 
Villonodular synovitis is a joint disorder most common in young adults 
characterized by an abnormal proliferation of the synovial membrane. Multifocal 
Villonodular synovitis is a rare disease whose recurrent nature can make its 
management particularly difficult. Currently, there is no systemic therapy 
recommended in diffuse and recurrent forms, especially because of the fear of 
long-term side effects in patients, who are usually young. Yet, tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors seem promising to reduce the effects of an aberrant colony 
stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) production at the origin of the synovial nodule 
proliferation. We present here the case of a 21-year-old woman with NS 
associated to diffuse multifocal villonodular synovitis (DMVS). Our clinical 
case provides therapeutic experience in this very rare association. Indeed, in 
association with surgery, the patient improved considerably: she had complete 
daily life autonomy, knee joint amplitudes of 100° in flexion and 0° in 
extension and was able to walk for 10 min without any technical assistance. To 
our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient suffering from DMVS 
associated with a Noonan syndrome treated with Glivec® (oral administration at a 
dosage of 340 mg/m2 in children, until disease regression) on a long-term basis.

OBJECTIVES: Despite adverse physical and mental health outcomes related to 
caregiving, family caregivers also experience lower mortality rates compared to 
noncaregivers. However, research has not yet examined the role of caregiving 
intensity and religiosity with health and mortality among spousal caregivers.
METHODS: Data include spousal caregivers (n=5,214 person-wave observations) and 
noncaregivers (n=50,311 person-wave observations) from the Health and Retirement 
Study (2004-2014 waves). Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore how 
caregiving intensity and religiosity were associated with health and mortality 
among spousal caregivers, compared health and mortality between caregivers and 
noncaregiving peers, and examined gender differences in these mechanisms.
RESULTS: Greater religious salience and attending religious services, although 
dependent on gender and caregiving intensity, are protective for caregivers' 
health and mortality.
DISCUSSION: Religiosity may buffer adverse effects of caregiving on health and 
mortality for spousal caregivers. Continuation of prior religiosity may enhance 
positive aspects of caregiving and decrease caregiver burden.

Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is the most expensive spice plant and is distributed 
widely around the world. However, its production is limited by corm rot, a 
disastrous disease, attributed to Fusarium oxysporum in many regions of the 
world. In 2020, extensive surveys were carried out in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Anhui, 
and Guizhou provinces as saffron growing areas of China. Fourteen single-spore 
isolates were obtained from rotted corms and identified as F. nirenbergiae 
according to morphological appearance and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with 
translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1), DNA-directed RNA polymerase II largest 
subunit (rpb2), and β-tubulin (tub2). Results of the pathogenicity assay 
supported the conclusion that F. nirenbergiae is the pathogen responsible for 
corm rot. In this study, we obtained the whole genome sequence of two highly 
virulent F. nirenbergiae strains via the Illumina HiSeq platform. Genome 
sequence assemblies of approximately 52.7 and 52.2 Mb were generated for 
isolates WY5 and SH1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first report of F. nirenbergiae causing C. sativus corm rot in China and indeed 
worldwide. Results from this research contribute to our understanding of genetic 
diversity, genomic information, and host determination, which will enable 
researchers to design appropriate management measures for this hazardous 
disease.

Hypothermia is a common adverse event during continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), affecting multiple organ systems and increasing risk of poor 
health outcomes among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing CRRT. 
TheraMax blood warmers are the next generation of extracorporeal blood warmers 
which reduce risk of hypothermia during CRRT. The purpose of this study is to 
elucidate the potential health economic impacts of avoiding CRRT-induced 
hypothermia by using the novel TherMax blood warming device. This study compares 
health care costs associated with use of the new TherMax blood warmer unit 
integrated with the PrisMax system compared to CRRT with a standalone blood 
warming device to avoid hypothermia in continuous renal replacement therapy 
(CRRT). An economic model was developed in which relevant health states for each 
intervention were normothermia, hypothermia, discharge, and death. Clinical 
inputs and costs were obtained from a combination of retrospective chart review 
and publicly available summary estimates. The proportion of AKI patients treated 
with CRRT who became hypothermic (<36°C) during CRRT treatment was 34.5% in the 
TherMax group compared to 71.9% in the 'standalone warmer' group. Given the 
78.7-year average life expectancy in the US and the assumed average patient age 
at discharge/death of 65.4 years, the total life-years gained by avoiding 
mortality related to hypothermia was 9.0 in the TherMax group compared to 8.0 in 
the 'standalone warmer' group. Cost per life-year gained was $8,615 in the 
TherMax group versus $10,115 in the 'standalone warmer' group for a difference 
of -$1,501 favoring TherMax. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
negative, indicating superior cost-effectiveness for TherMax versus 'standalone 
warmer'. The TherMax blood warming device used with the PrisMax system is 
associated with lower risk of hypothermia, which our model indicates leads to 
lower costs, lower risk of mortality due to hypothermia, and superior 
cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the impact of a group-based weight 
management programme on symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with 
self-help in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).
METHOD: People with overweight (Body Mass Index [BMI]≥28kg/m2) were randomly 
allocated self-help (n = 211) or a group-based weight management programme for 
12 weeks (n = 528) or 52 weeks (n = 528) between 18/10/2012 and 10/02/2014. 
Symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, at
