or more over the first 18 months after fracture. The accumulated mean QoL loss 
after hip fracture was 0.5 and significantly greater than after fracture of the 
distal forearm (0.13), spine (0.21), proximal humerus (0.26), and ankle (0.27).
INTRODUCTION: Data on QoL following osteoporotic fractures in Russia are scarce. 
The present study evaluated the impact of hip, vertebral, proximal humerus, 
distal forearm, and ankle fracture up to 18 months after fracture from the 
Russian arm of the International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic 
Fractures Study.
METHODS: Individuals age ≥ 50 years with low-energy-induced humeral, hip, 
clinical vertebral, ankle, or distal forearm fracture were enrolled. After a 
recall of pre-fracture status, HRQoL was prospectively collected over 18 months 
of follow-up using EQ-5D-3L. Multivariate regression analysis was used to 
identify determinants of QALYs loss.
RESULTS: At 2 weeks, patients with hip fracture (n = 223) reported the lowest 
mean health state utility value (HSUV) compared with other fracture sites. 
Thereafter, utility values increased but remained significantly lower than 
before fracture. For spine (n = 183), humerus (n = 166), and ankle fractures 
(n = 214), there was a similar pattern of disutility with a nadir within 2 weeks 
and a progressive recovery thereafter. The accumulated mean QoL loss after hip 
fracture was 0.5 and significantly greater than after fracture of the distal 
forearm (0.13), spine (0.21), proximal humerus (0.26), and ankle (0.27). 
Substantial impairment in self-care and usual activities immediately after 
fracture were important predictors of recovery across at all fracture sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Fractures of the hip, vertebral, distal forearm, ankle, and 
proximal humerus incur substantial loss of QoL in Russia. The utility values 
derived from this study can be used in future economic evaluations.

The significant gain in life expectancy led to an increase in the incidence and 
prevalence of dementia. Although vascular risk factors have long and repeatedly 
been shown to increase the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), translating these 
findings into effective preventive measures has failed. In addition, the finding 
that incident ischemic stroke approximately doubles the risk of a patient to 
develop AD has been recently reinforced. Current knowledge and pathogenetic 
hypotheses of AD are discussed. The implication of oxidative stress in the 
development of AD is reviewed, with special emphasis on its sudden burst in the 
setting of acute ischemic stroke and the possible link between this increase in 
oxidative stress and consequent cognitive impairment. Current knowledge and 
future directions in the prevention and treatment of AD are discussed outlining 
the hypothesis of a possible beneficial effect of antioxidant treatment in acute 
ischemic stroke in delaying the onset/progression of dementia.

    Health Policy Plan. 2022 Sep 13;37(8):1066-1069.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds are important decision rules that determine 
whether health interventions represent good value for money. In low- and 
middle-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) one to three times 
per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) averted has been the most widely used threshold for informing resource 
allocation decisions. However, in 2016, the WHO withdrew recommendations for 
using this threshold, creating a significant vacuum in South Africa and many 
countries that rely on results of cost-effectiveness analyses for making 
resource allocation decisions. This study estimates a cost-effectiveness 
threshold that reflects the health opportunity cost of health spending in South 
Africa using a three-step approach. First, marginal returns to health spending 
was estimated as health spending elasticity for crude death rates using a fixed 
effect estimation approach. Second, the opportunity cost of health spending was 
estimated as DALYs averted. Finally, a cost per DALY averted threshold was 
estimated as the inverse of the marginal product of health spending. We show 
that 1% of total health spending in 2015 (equivalent to approximately ZAR 1.54 
billion/USD 120.7 million) averted 1050 deaths, 34 180 years of life lost, 
5880 years lived with disability and 40 055 DALYs. The cost-effectiveness 
threshold was estimated at approximately ZAR 38 500 (USD 3015) per DALY averted, 
∼53% of South Africa's per capita GDP in 2015 (ZAR 72 700/USD 5700) and lower 
than the previously recommended one to three times per capita GDP. As South 
Africa moves towards implementing universal health coverage reforms through 
National Health Insurance by 2025, the adoption of a threshold that reflects 
health opportunity costs will be crucial for ensuring efficiency in the 
allocation of scarce resources. This study provides useful insight into the 
magnitude of the health opportunity cost of health spending in South Africa and 
highlights the need for further research.

First, we revisit the "life lived equals life left" property for stationary 
populations and discuss it from a more general perspective. Specifically, we 
show that identically distributed random age and the remaining lifetime in 
stationary populations have the same distribution as the equilibrium 
distribution of the renewal theory. Then we consider specific non-stationary 
populations that are closed to migration and have a constant birth rate. We 
obtain some useful inequalities between random age and remaining lifetime for 
different instants of calendar time. We also discuss the aging properties of 
populations using different stochastic orders.

Pyricularia oryzae is the causal agent of blast disease on staple gramineous 
crops. Sulphur is an essential element for the biosynthesis of cysteine and 
methionine in fungi. Here, we targeted the P. oryzae PoMET3 encoding the enzyme 
ATP sulfurylase, and PoMET14 encoding the APS (adenosine-5'-phosphosulphate) 
kinase that are involved in sulfate assimilation and sulphur-containing amino 
acids biosynthesis. In P. oryzae, deletion of PoMET3 or PoMET14 separately 
results in defects of conidiophore formation, significant impairments in 
conidiation, methionine and cysteine auxotrophy, limited invasive hypha 
extension, and remarkably reduced virulence on rice and barley. Furthermore, the 
defects of the null mutants could be restored by supplementing with exogenous 
cysteine or methionine. Our study explored the biological functions of sulfur 
assimilation and sulphur-containing amino acids biosynthesis in P. oryzae.

PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that omission of radiation 
therapy (RT) in older women with early-stage cancer undergoing breast conserving 
surgery (BCS) is an "acceptable choice." Despite this, high RT rates have been 
reported. The objective was to evaluate the impact of patient- and system-level 
factors on RT rates in a contemporary cohort.
METHODS: Through the National Cancer Data Base, we identified women with 
clinical stage I estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who underwent BCS 
(n = 84,214). Multivariable logistic regression identified patient, tumor, and 
system-level factors associated with RT. Joinpoint regression analysis 
calculated trends in RT use over time stratified by age and facility-type, 
reporting annual percent change (APC).
RESULTS: RT rates decreased from 2004 (77.2%) to 2015 (64.3%). The decline 
occurred earliest and was most pronounced in older women treated at academic 
facilities. At academic facilities, the APC was - 5.6 (95% CI - 8.6, - 2.4) 
after 2009 for women aged > 85 years, - 6.4 (95% CI - 9.0, - 3.8) after 2010 for 
women aged 80 -  < 85 years, - 3.7 (95% CI - 5.6, - 1.9) after 2009 for women 
aged 75 -  < 80, and - 2.4 (95% CI, - 3.1, - 1.6) after 2009 for women aged 
70 -  < 75. In contrast, at community facilities rates of RT declined later 
(2011, 2012, and 2013 for age groups 70-74, 75-79, and 80-84 years).
CONCLUSIONS: RT rates for older women with early-stage breast cancer are 
declining with patient-level variation based on factors related to life 
expectancy and locoregional recurrence. Facility-level variation suggests 
opportunities to improve care delivery by focusing on barriers to 
de-implementation of routine use of RT.

PURPOSE: The 1-year mortality rate of patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) on renal replacement therapy (RRT) is 20-25% comparable to many cancers. 
Studies have shown that cancer patients commonly overestimate their likelihood 
of survival relative to their physicians. It is unclear if this translates into 
other terminal illnesses.
METHODS: Adult and elderly patients with ESRD on RRT without cognitive defect 
were interviewed to evaluate their prognostic estimates at 1 and 5 years. Past 
medical history and demographic data was abstracted from their medical charts. 
Each patient's proper nephrologist was then interviewed regarding his proper 
prognostic estimate for this patient. Both the patient and the nephrologist's 
estimates were compared and a difference of greater than 20% was defined as the 
threshold for prognostic concordance.
RESULTS: 77% of patients were found to be in prognostic discordance with their 
nephrologists. This group was older, had more comorbidities, a lower albumin 
level and a poorer prognosis. The majority of patients were in disagreement with 
their nephrologists regarding whether a discussion about prognosis had taken 
place. The choice of end of life care for 55% of patients was focused on 
relieving pain and discomfort.
CONCLUSION: Communication of prognosis and discussions related to life 
expectancy and end of life care are lacking in the routine care of ESRD 
patients. ESRD patients therefore tend to overestimate their prognosis which 
might lead to overutilization of invasive procedures with increased acute 
healthcare costs as well as a delay in instigation of palliative or hospice 
measures.

Indwelling Pleural Catheter Drainage Strategy for Malignant Effusion: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Comment in
    Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2020 Jun;17(6):685-687.

Rationale: The likelihood of achieving pleurodesis after indwelling pleural 
catheter (IPC) placement for malignant pleural effusion varies with the specific 
drainage strategy used: symptom-guided drainage, daily drainage, or talc 
instillation through the IPC (IPC + talc). The relative cost-effectiveness of 
one strategy over the other is unknown.Objectives: We performed a decision tree 
model-based analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of each IPC drainage 
strategy from a healthcare system perspective.Methods: We developed a decision 
tree model using theoretical event probability data derived from three 
randomized clinical trials and used 2019 Medicare reimbursement data for cost 
estimation. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
over an analytical horizon of 6 months with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Monte Carlo probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to measure 
the uncertainty surrounding base case estimates.Results: IPC + talc was a 
cost-effective alternative to symptom-guided drainage, with an ICER of 
$59,729/QALY. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that this 
strategy was favored in 54% of simulations. However, symptom-guided drainage was 
cost effective for pleurodesis rates >20% and for life expectancy <4 months. 
Daily drainage was not cost effective in any scenario, including for patients 
with nonexpandable lung, in whom it had an ICER of $2,474,612/QALY over 
symptom-guided drainage.Conclusions: For patients with malignant pleural 
effusion and an expandable lung, IPC + talc may be cost effective relative to 
symptom-guided drainage, although considerable uncertainty exists around this 
estimation. Daily IPC drainage is not a cost-effective strategy under any 
circumstance.

Modeling the evolution of bone density is relevant for understanding, simulation 
and possible prediction of bone response to external and internal influences. In 
this work we present a formulation for the bone density evolution process that 
takes into account not only the commonly considered mechanical stimulus, but, as 
novelty, also the influence of the availability of nutrients and hormones, with 
its implementation pursued within the finite element method. A simple uni-axial 
extension test is used to illustrate and compare our novel model against the 
classical approach. The results of the proposed modified model are promising for 
application to real-life problems.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a cancer in the bone marrow causing bone 
destruction. Patients experience various symptoms related to the disease and/or 
treatment, such as pain and fatigue, leading to poorer quality of life. The 
symptom burden might affect physical function and physical activity levels, 
posing a risk of physical deterioration. The aim was to investigate whether 
physical function in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma differs from 
the reference values of the normal population and other cancer patients.
METHODS: The study is a cross sectional descriptive analysis of a prospective 
cohort of 100 patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Four physical 
function tests were carried out; Six-Minute-Walk-Test, Sit-to-Stand-Test, grip 
strength and knee extension strength. Age and gender specific results of 
physical function from the multiple myeloma population were compared to 
normative data and to data from other cancer populations.
RESULTS: Of the 100 patients included, 73% had bone disease and 55% received 
pain relieving medicine. Mean age was 67.7 years (SD 10.3). Patients with 
multiple myeloma had significantly poorer physical function compared to 
normative data, both regarding aerobic capacity and muscle strength, although 
not grip strength. No differences in physical function were found between 
patients with multiple myeloma and other cancer populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical function in newly diagnosed Danish patients with multiple 
myeloma is lower than in the normal population. Exercise intervention studies 
are warranted to explore the value of physical exercise on physical function.

PURPOSE: We examined (1) if child maltreatment (CM) is associated with lower 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and fewer quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) over a 9-year follow-up of midlife women and (2) if adulthood 
psychosocial mediators could explain these associations.
METHODS: Women (n = 342) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. 
Longitudinal HRQoL and QALY outcomes measured at five study visits include 
36-item Short-Form Health Survey mental component score and physical component 
score and the Short Form-6 Dimension health index. Aims 1 and 2 were 
investigated by generalized estimating equations and sequential structural 
nested mean models, respectively.
RESULTS: Twenty percent reported 2+ CM types. Compared with women without CM, 
women who experienced 2+ CM types reported 5- and 4-points lower scores in 
mental component score and physical component score, respectively, and 28 fewer 
healthy days per year in QALY. Low optimism, sleep problems, and low social 
support each explained greater than 10% of the relationship between 2+ CM and 
HRQoL and QALY over time.
CONCLUSIONS: CM is a life-course social determinant of HRQoL and QALY throughout 
midlife, particularly in women who experienced 2+ CM types. Several mediators 
are modifiable and could be targets of interventions to mitigate the negative 
impact of CM on midlife HRQoL and QALY in women.

The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and the cardiovascular 
complications associated with this disease, are rapidly increasing worldwide. 
Individuals with diabetes have a higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular 
diseases and a reduced life expectancy compared to those without diabetes. This 
poses a significant economic burden on health-care systems worldwide, making the 
diabetes epidemic a global health crisis. Sex differences in the presentation 
and outcome of diabetes do exist. Premenopausal women are protected from 
developing diabetes and its cardiovascular complications relative to males and 
postmenopausal women. However, women with diabetes tend to have a higher 
mortality as a result of cardiovascular complications than age-matched men. 
Despite this evidence, preclinical and clinical research looking at sex as a 
biologic variable in metabolic disorders and their cardiovascular complications 
is very limited. The aim of this review is to highlight the current knowledge of 
the potential protective role of estrogens in humans as well as rodent models of 
diabetes mellitus, and the possible pathways by which this protection is 
conferred. We stress the importance of increasing knowledge of sex-specific 
differences to facilitate the development of more targeted prevention 
strategies.

The therapeutic landscape of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has profoundly 
changed over the past 7 years. Most patients with chronic phase (CP) now have a 
normal life expectancy. Another goal is achieving a stable deep molecular 
response (DMR) and discontinuing medication for treatment-free remission (TFR). 
The European LeukemiaNet convened an expert panel to critically evaluate and 
update the evidence to achieve these goals since its previous recommendations. 
First-line treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; imatinib brand or 
generic, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are available first-line). Generic 
imatinib is the cost-effective initial treatment in CP. Various 
contraindications and side-effects of all TKIs should be considered. Patient 
risk status at diagnosis should be assessed with the new EUTOS long-term 
survival (ELTS)-score. Monitoring of response should be done by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction whenever possible. A change of treatment is 
recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or when molecular milestones 
are not reached. Greater than 10% BCR-ABL1 at 3 months indicates treatment 
failure when confirmed. Allogeneic transplantation continues to be a therapeutic 
option particularly for advanced phase CML. TKI treatment should be withheld 
during pregnancy. Treatment discontinuation may be considered in patients with 
durable DMR with the goal of achieving TFR.

Climate variation and trends affect species distribution and abundance across 
large spatial extents. However, most studies that predict species response to 
climate are implemented at small spatial scales or are based on 
occurrence-environment relationships that lack mechanistic detail. Here, we 
develop an integrated population model (IPM) for multi-site count and 
capture-recapture data for a declining migratory songbird, Wilson's warbler 
(Cardellina pusilla), in three genetically distinct breeding populations in 
western North America. We include climate covariates of vital rates, including 
spring temperatures on the breeding grounds, drought on the wintering range in 
northwest Mexico, and wind conditions during spring migration. Spring 
temperatures were positively related to productivity in Sierra Nevada and 
Pacific Northwest genetic groups, and annual changes in productivity were 
important predictors of changes in growth rate in these populations. Drought 
condition on the wintering grounds was a strong predictor of adult survival for 
coastal California and Sierra Nevada populations; however, adult survival played 
a relatively minor role in explaining annual variation in population change. A 
latent parameter representing a mixture of first-year survival and immigration 
was the largest contributor to variation in population change; however, this 
parameter was estimated imprecisely, and its importance likely reflects, in 
part, differences in spatio-temporal distribution of samples between count and 
capture-recapture data sets. Our modeling approach represents a novel and 
flexible framework for linking broad-scale multi-site monitoring data sets. Our 
results highlight both the potential of the approach for extension to additional 
species and systems, as well as needs for additional data and/or model 
development.

Metabolically Healthy Obesity.

Blüher M(1).

Author information:

of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany and Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic, Obesity and 
Vascular Research, Helmholtz Zentrum München, University Hospital Leipzig, 
Leipzig, Germany.

Obesity contributes to reduced life expectancy, impaired quality of life, and 
disabilities, mainly in those individuals who develop cardiovascular diseases, 
type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and cancer. However, there is a large variation 
in the individual risk to developing obesity-associated comorbid diseases that 
cannot simply be explained by the extent of adiposity. Observations that a 
proportion of individuals with obesity have a significantly lower risk for 
cardiometabolic abnormalities led to the concept of metabolically healthy 
obesity (MHO). Although there is no clear definition, normal glucose and lipid 
metabolism parameters-in addition to the absence of hypertension-usually serve 
as criteria to diagnose MHO. Biological mechanisms underlying MHO lower amounts 
of ectopic fat (visceral and liver), and higher leg fat deposition, 
expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue, preserved insulin sensitivity, and 
beta-cell function as well as better cardiorespiratory fitness compared to 
unhealthy obesity. Whereas the absence of metabolic abnormalities may reduce the 
risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in metabolically healthy 
individuals compared to unhealthy individuals with obesity, it is still higher 
in comparison with healthy lean individuals. In addition, MHO seems to be a 
transient phenotype further justifying therapeutic weight loss attempts-even in 
this subgroup-which might not benefit from reducing body weight to the same 
extent as patients with unhealthy obesity. Metabolically healthy obesity 
represents a model to study mechanisms linking obesity to cardiometabolic 
complications. Metabolically healthy obesity should not be considered a safe 
condition, which does not require obesity treatment, but may guide 
decision-making for a personalized and risk-stratified obesity treatment.

BACKGROUND: Despite guidelines recommending not to continue cancer screening for 
adults > 75 years old, especially those with short life expectancy, primary care 
providers (PCPs) feel ill-prepared to discuss stopping screening with older 
adults.
OBJECTIVE: To develop scripts and strategies for PCPs to use to discuss stopping 
cancer screening with adults > 75.
DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interview guides to conduct 
individual interviews with adults > 75 years old and focus groups and/or 
individual interviews with PCPs.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five PCPs and 30 patients > 75 years old participated from 
six community or academic Boston-area primary care practices.
APPROACH: Participants were asked their thoughts on discussions around stopping 
cancer screening and to provide feedback on scripts that were iteratively 
revised for PCPs to use when discussing stopping mammography and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) screening.
RESULTS: Twenty-one (47%) of the 45 PCPs were community based. Nineteen (63%) of 
the 30 patients were female, and 13 (43%) were non-Hispanic white. PCPs reported 
using different approaches to discuss stopping cancer screening depending on the 
clinical scenario. PCPs noted it was easier to discuss stopping screening when 
the harms of screening clearly outweighed the benefits for a patient. In these 
cases, PCPs felt more comfortable being more directive. When the balance between 
the benefits and harms of screening was less clear, PCPs endorsed shared 
decision-making but found this approach more challenging because it was 
difficult to explain why to stop screening. While patients were generally 
enthusiastic about screening, they also reported not wanting to undergo tests of 
little value and said they would stop screening if their PCP recommended it. By 
the end of participant interviews, no further edits were recommended to the 
scripts.
CONCLUSIONS: To increase PCP comfort and capability to discuss stopping cancer 
screening with older adults, we developed scripts and strategies that PCPs may 
use for discussing stopping cancer screening.

Many neurological conditions may result in long-term disability. The measures of 
prevalence and mortality vastly understate the disability they cause. In the 
Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 (equal opportunities, protection of rights, 
and full participation), neurological conditions are ignored. Although Indian 
Disability Evaluation and Asessment Scale (IDEAS), which assesses psychiatric 
conditions, does include dementia as one of the neurodegenerative conditions. 
Additionally, according to the global burden of disease report, 33% of years 
lived with neurological disability and 13% of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) are due to neurological and psychiatric disorders. In 2001, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) established a new definition of disability, declaring 
it an umbrella term with the following three major components; 1) impairments: 
problems in body function or structure, 2) activity limitations: difficulties 
encountered by a person in executing a task or action, and 3) participation 
restrictions: problems of involvement in life situations experienced by a 
person. Hence, an attempt was made to rectify the above concerns. To address the 
above mentioned concerns, we think that there is a need of a comprehensive 
format for neurological disabilities assessment which would also include 
objective neuropsychological assessments. As future directions, national level 
meetings are required to formulate 'Indian Standard Track for Assessing 
Neurological Disability' (I-STAND) and uniform guidelines for disability 
assessment in 'chronic neurological conditions' with a special focus on 
"neuropsychological disability".

Oenothein B (OEB) exhibits extensive biological activities, but few 
investigations have been carried out on the pharmacologic influence of OEB on 
longevity in any organism. To explore the potential pharmacological ability of 
OEB to postpone the progression of age-related degenerative processes and 
diseases, we monitored the effects of OEB isolated from Eucalyptus leaves on the 
lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) at four different 
concentrations. We found that OEB increased the median lifespan of worms by up 
to 22% in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that OEB 
significantly enhanced youthfulness (healthy lifespan) by increasing the whole 
adult life's locomotory mobility, reducing age pigment and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) accumulation, and enhancing thermal stress resistance. 
Furthermore, the genes daf-16, age-1, eat-2, sir-2.1, and isp-1 were required 
for the healthy longevity benefits induced by OEB, but not the genes mev-1 and 
clk-1. Taken together, OEB might modulate multiple genetic pathways involved in 
insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) via age-1 and daf-16, the dietary restriction (DR) 
pathway via eat-2 and sir-2.1, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain 
via isp-1 to promote healthy lifespan including the reduction of age pigment and 
ROS accumulation and the enhancement of locomotory mobility, thermal stress 
tolerance and lifespan. These findings indicated that OEB has the potential to 
be developed into the next generation of multi-target drugs for prolonging 
healthy lifespan and intervening in age-related diseases.

Prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in a group of adults with Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus.

Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. millar.ali@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has become a global pandemic. 
With the improvement of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment regimens, life-expectancy 
of HIV-positive individuals has increased. HIV literature suggests that head and 
neck manifestations may be the first indication of supressed immunity. 
Therefore, research regarding the effects of HIV and new treatment regimens on 
auditory function remains a priority.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the audiological characteristics and determine the 
prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in a group of HIV-positive individuals 
on ARV treatment residing in a rural province.
METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional descriptive research design. 
Participants were recruited from the clinic and pharmacy waiting areas of a 
medical centre in a rural area of Limpopo province, South Africa. Two 
participant groups, an HIV-positive group (N1 = 60) and an HIV-negative group 
(N2 = 32) were included in the study. The test battery comprised a comprehensive 
case history and a routine audiological test battery, which included otoscopy, 
tympanometry and pure tone audiometry (250 Hz to 8000 Hz).
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found regarding the 
prevalence of hearing loss in the two participant groups (p = 0.709). However, 
the prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher in the HIV-positive group (p 
= 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The insignificant difference in the audiological test battery 
results found between the two participant groups may be due to improved ARV 
treatment regimens and management strategies employed at the medical centre. 
However, the increased prevalence of tinnitus in the HIV-positive group may also 
be attributed to the ARV regimen and/or the result of subtle damage to the 
auditory system, which was not identified by the current audiological test 
battery. More insight may be obtained about the effects of HIV on hearing by 
employing a longitudinal research design and inclusion of a more ototoxicity 
sensitive test battery.
