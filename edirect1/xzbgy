Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) following sleeve gastrectomy is rare. There are 
limited documented cases within the literature. The presentation of PVT varies 
on a spectrum from mild non-specific abdominal symptoms to life endangering 
clinical emergencies. This is the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented to 
the surgical assessment unit with acute onset abdominal pain 2 weeks post 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. The initial diagnosis was 
that of a gastric sleeve leak. The patient deteriorated clinically and underwent 
a CT scan of her abdomen. This revealed the presence of an acute thrombus 
filling the portal vein with extension into the superior mesenteric vein 
branches. There were radiological changes suggestive of acute small bowel 
ischaemia. The patient underwent a laparotomy in theatre and 50 cm of the 
necrotic small bowel was resected. Postoperative care was carried out in the 
intensive care unit for 15 days.

BACKGROUND: The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score predicts future coronary 
heart disease (CHD) events and could be used to guide primary prevention 
interventions, but CAC measurement has costs and exposes patients to low-dose 
radiation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of measuring CAC and 
prescribing statin therapy based on the resulting score under a range of 
assumptions using an established model enhanced with CAC distribution and risk 
estimates from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Ten years of statin 
treatment for 10,000 55-year-old women with high cholesterol (10-year CHD risk, 
7.5%) was projected to prevent 32 myocardial infarctions, cause 70 cases of 
statin-induced myopathy, and add 1108 years to total life expectancy. Measuring 
CAC and targeting statin treatment to the 2500 women with CAC>0 would provide 
45% of the benefit (+501 life-years), but CAC measurement would cost $2.25 
million and cause 9 radiation-induced cancers. Treat all was preferable to CAC 
screening in this scenario and across a broad range of other scenarios (CHD 
risk, 2.5%-15%) when statin assumptions were favorable ($0.13 per pill and no 
quality of life penalty). When statin assumptions were less favorable ($1.00 per 
pill and disutility=0.00384), CAC screening with statin treatment for persons 
with CAC>0 was cost-effective (<$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year) in this 
scenario, in 55-year-old men with CHD risk 7.5%, and in other intermediate risk 
scenarios (CHD risk, 5%-10%). Our results were critically sensitive to statin 
cost and disutility and relatively robust to other assumptions. Alternate CAC 
treatment thresholds (>100 or >300) were generally not cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: CAC testing in intermediate risk patients can be cost-effective but 
only if statins are costly or significantly affect quality of life.

[Treatment of periprosthetic fractures : new concepts in operative treatment].

[Article in German]

Münster, Deutschland.

BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic fractures represent a common and complex challenge in 
the clinical practice in orthopedics and trauma surgery. Due to demographic 
changes characterized by increased life expectancy and higher numbers of primary 
arthroplasties, the number of periprosthetic fractures is increasing as well. 
Factors such as osteoporosis, multimorbidity and a highly active aging 
population additionally increase the complexity of periprosthetic fractures.
INJURY PATTERNS: Most periprosthetic fractures affect the proximal and distal 
femur; however, periprosthetic fractures of the tibial head, the ankle, 
shoulders and the upper extremities as well as complex interprosthetic fractures 
pose an increasing challenge for orthopedic and trauma surgeons.
THERAPY: Many therapeutic options exist and the number of implants especially 
designed to treat periprosthetic fractures is steadily rising. Principally, 
loosened prostheses are indicative for replacement operations whereas for 
periprosthetic fractures of well-anchored prostheses as a rule osteosynthesis is 
necessary. A standardized treatment algorithm does not yet exist and usually the 
decision of how to treat these fractures has to be made on an individual basis.
PERSPECTIVES: The present article demonstrates the current state of open 
reduction and internal fixation of periprosthetic fractures with respect to 
biomechanical principles and furthermore provides an overview on implant 
augmentation.

Clarifying relationships between persistent organic pollutant concentrations and 
age in wildlife biomonitoring: individuals, cross-sections, and the roles of 
lifespan and sex.

Binnington MJ(1), Wania F.

Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Relationships between persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels and age in 
wildlife biomonitoring are often interpreted as changes in contaminant burden as 
organisms age. However, cross-sectional body burden-age trends (CBATs) obtained 
from biomonitoring studies, which sample individuals of different ages at the 
same time, should not be confused with longitudinal body burden-age trends 
(LBATs) obtained by sampling the same individuals repeatedly through time. To 
clarify how CBATs and LBATs for wildlife species deviate from each other, and 
describe any impact of lifespan and sex, we used mechanistic bioaccumulation 
models to estimate historic longitudinal exposures of polar cod, ringed seals, 
beluga whales, and bowhead whales to polychlorinated biphenyl congener 153. 
Cross-sectional body burden-age trends were then produced by sampling resultant 
LBATs of successive birth cohorts at specific time points. As found previously 
for humans, the year of sampling relative to the year of peak environmental 
contamination was a critical parameter in determining male CBAT shapes. However, 
a similar cohort effect was not apparent for reproductive females because 
efficient POP loss through lactation prevented their lipids from retaining a 
memory of past exposure levels. Thus, lactation loss was not only responsible 
for the large differences between the CBATs of males and females of the same 
species, but also the lack of female CBAT variability through time. 
Cross-sectional body burden-age trend shapes varied little between species by 
lifespan, as long as equivalent age scales were used. However, lifespan relative 
to the timescale of environmental contaminant level changes did determine the 
extent to which CBATs resembled LBATs for males. We suggest that accounting for 
birth cohort and sex effects is essential when interpreting age trends in POP 
biomonitoring studies of long-lived species.

A frameshift mutation in GRXCR2 causes recessively inherited hearing loss.

Imtiaz A(1), Kohrman DC, Naz S.

Author information:

More than 360 million humans are affected with some degree of hearing loss, 
either early or later in life. A genetic cause for the disorder is present in a 
majority of the cases. We mapped a locus (DFNB101) for hearing loss in humans to 
chromosome 5q in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Exome sequencing revealed an 
insertion mutation in GRXCR2 as the cause of moderate-to-severe and likely 
progressive hearing loss in the affected individuals of the family. The 
frameshift mutation is predicted to affect a conserved, cysteine-rich region of 
GRXCR2, and to result in an abnormal extension of the C-terminus. Functional 
studies by cell transfections demonstrated that the mutant protein is unstable 
and mislocalized relative to wild-type GRXCR2, consistent with a 
loss-of-function mutation. Targeted disruption of Grxcr2 is concurrently 
reported to cause hearing loss in mice. The structural abnormalities in this 
animal model suggest a role for GRXCR2 in the development of stereocilia 
bundles, specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory cells in the 
cochlea that are critical for sound detection. Our results indicate that GRXCR2 
should be considered in differential genetic diagnosis for individuals with 
early onset, moderate-to-severe and progressive hearing loss.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus may be present in patients with cystic fibrosis 
starting in the second decade of life. The prevalence increases rapidly with 
increasing age. As life-expectancy increases in cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis 
related diabetes will be diagnosed more frequently in the future.Up to date, no 
data are available to answer the question if cystic fibrosis related diabetes 
should always initially be treated by insulin therapy. Missing data regarding 
oral antidiabetic treatment of newly diagnosed cystic fibrosis related diabetes 
are an important reason to recommend insulin treatment. Several centres report 
the successful management of cystic fibrosis related diabetes using oral 
anti-diabetic drugs at least for some years. Oral therapies would be less 
invasive for a patient group which is highly traumatized by a very demanding 
therapy. Based on an initiative of the German Mukoviszidosis-Foundation, the 
present study tries to answer the question, whether oral therapy with 
repaglinide is as effective as insulin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients with 
early diagnosed diabetes mellitus.
METHODS/DESIGN: In all cystic fibrosis patients with an age of 10 years or 
older, an oral glucose tolerance test is recommended. The result of this test is 
classified according to the WHO cut off values. It is required to have two 
diabetes positive oral glucose tolerance tests for the diagnosis of diabetes 
mellitus.This study is a multi-national, multicentre, open labelled, randomized 
and prospective controlled parallel group's trial, with 24 months treatment.The 
primary objective of this trial is to compare the glycaemic control of oral 
therapy with Repaglinide with insulin injections in patients with cystic 
fibrosis related diabetes after 2 years of treatment.The trial should include 74 
subjects showing cystic fibrosis related diabetes newly diagnosed by oral 
glucose tolerance test during annual screening for cystic fibrosis related 
diabetes.Patients are randomised by central fax randomisation.Primary endpoint 
is mean HbA1c after 24 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints are change in 
FEV1% predicted and change in BMI-Z-score.
DISCUSSION: There is only one prospective study comparing oral antidiabetic 
drugs to insulin in the treatment of CFRD without fasting hyperglycaemia. The 
results regarding BMI after 6 months and 12 months showed an improvement for the 
insulin treated patients and were inconsistent for those treated with 
repaglinide. HbA1c and lung function (FEV1%pred) were unchanged for either 
group. The authors compared the changes -12 months to baseline and baseline to 
+12 months separately for each group. Therefore a direct comparison of the 
effect of repaglinide versus insulin on BMI, HbA1c and FEV1%pred was not 
presented. According to our protocol, we will directly compare treatment effects 
(HbA1c, BMI, FEV1%pred) in between both groups. The actual Cochrane report 
regarding "Insulin and oral agents for managing CFRD" stated that further 
studies are needed to establish whether there is clear benefit for hypoglycemic 
agents. We expect that the results of our study will help to address this 
clinical need.

income in Taiwan: an 11-year longitudinal study.

Health, National Taiwan University, Room 722, No, 17, Xuzhou Road, Taipei City 
100, Taiwan. ccchan@ntu.edu.tw.

BACKGROUND: Petrochemical industries have been identified as important sources 
of emissions of chemical substances, and adverse health outcomes have been 
reported for residents who live nearby. The purpose of the current study was to 
examine the adverse effects of petrochemical industrialization in Taiwan on the 
life expectancy and personal income of people living in nearby communities.
METHODS: This study compared life expectancies and personal income between one 
industrial county (Yunlin County) and one reference county (Yilan County), which 
had no significant industrial activity that might emit pollutants, in Taiwan 
through analysis of 11 year long and publicly available data. Data from before 
and after the petrochemical company in the industrial county started (year 1999) 
operating were compared.
RESULTS: Residents of the industrialized county had lesser increases in life 
expectancy over time than did residents of a similar but less-industrialized 
county, with difference means ranging from 0.89 years (p<0.05) to 1.62 years 
(p<0.001) at different stages. Male residents were more vulnerable to the 
effects of industrialization. There were no significant differences in 
individual income between the two counties.
CONCLUSIONS: Countries, including Taiwan and the U.S., embracing petrochemical 
industries now face the challenge of environmental injustice. Our findings 
suggested that life expectancy lengthening was slowed and income growth was 
stalled for residents living in the industrial communities.

OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluation typically is conducted using health state 
utilities to estimate treatment benefits. However, such outcomes are often 
missing from studies of clinical effectiveness. This study aims to bridge that 
gap by providing appropriate methods to link values from the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to the EQ-5D utility 
instrument.
METHOD: Patients from a large registry of Spanish patients (n = 7072 
observations) with knee or hip osteoarthritis who completed both WOMAC and EQ-5D 
was used. A mixture model approach was used based on distributions bespoke to 
the EQ-5D UK value set to estimate EQ-5D as a function of WOMAC pain, stiffness 
and function subscores.
RESULTS: A five class mixture model provides very close fit to the observed data 
at all levels of disease severity. The overall mean (0.542 vs 0.542), median 
(0.620 vs 0.636) and the percentage of observations at full health (15 vs 14.8) 
were very similar between the observed data and the estimated model 
respectively. Stiffness has limited relationship to EQ-5D, whereas functional 
disability and pain are strong predictors.
CONCLUSION: EQ-5D can be reliably estimated from WOMAC subscale scores without 
any systematic bias using these results.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided versus symptom-guided therapy 
in heart failure (HF) patients ≥60 years old.
BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP guidance in HF patients is unclear. 
It may create additional costs with uncertain benefits.
METHODS: In the TIME-CHF (Trial of Intensified versus Standard Medical Therapy 
in Elderly Patients with Congestive Heart Failure), patients with left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤45% were randomized to receive 
intensified NT-proBNP-guided therapy or standard, symptom-guided therapy. For 
cost-effectiveness analysis, 467 (94%) patients (age 76 ± 7 years, 66% male) 
were eligible. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental 
costs per gained life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) within the 
18-month trial period, as defined per protocol.
RESULTS: NT-proBNP-guided therapy was dominant (i.e., more effective and less 
costly) over symptom-guided therapy, saving $2,979 USD (2.5 to 97.5% confidence 
interval [CI]: $8,758 to $3,265) per patient, with incremental effectiveness 
of +0.07 life-years and +0.05 QALYs. The probability of NT-proBNP-guided therapy 
being dominant was 80%, and the probability of saving 1 life-year or QALY at a 
cost of $50,000 was 97% and 93%, respectively. Exclusion of residence costs 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $5,870 per 
life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was most 
pronounced in patients <75 years old and in those with <2 significant 
comorbidities, being dominant in all sensitivity analyses. In the worst-case 
scenario (excluding residence costs in those with ≥2 comorbidities), the ICER 
was $11,935 per life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP-guided therapy has a high probability of being cost 
effective in HF patients with reduced LVEF, particularly in patients age 60 to 
75 years or with less than 2 comorbidities. (Trial of Intensified versus 
standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure

Publication of recent papers such as the one by Schoenbaum and colleagues 
entitled 'Mortality Amenable to Health Care in the United States: The Roles of 
Demographics and Health Systems Performance' has stimulated this commentary. We 
discuss strengths and limitations of amenable and avoidable mortality in 
health-care systems' performance and their contribution to health inequalities. 
To illustrate, we present a case study of avoidable and amenable mortality in 
Spain over 27 years. We conclude that amenable mortality is not a good indicator 
of health-care systems' performance, or for determining whether it could give 
rise to health inequalities. To understand health problems and to assess the 
impact of interventions affecting health requires good, basic, and routine 
monitoring of health indicators and of socioeconomic determinants of health.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term 
growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy in GH-deficient patients with chronic 
heart failure (CHF).
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
affects as many as 40% of patients with CHF, and short-term GH replacement 
causes functional benefit. Whether long-term GH replacement also affects CHF 
progression is unknown.
METHODS: The study is an extension of a previous randomized, controlled 
single-blind trial that screened 158 consecutive CHF patients (New York Heart 
Association classes II to IV) and identified 63 who had GHD by the growth 
hormone releasing hormone plus arginine test. Fifty-six patients were randomized 
to receive either GH therapy or standard CHF therapy. Patients were evaluated at 
baseline and after a 4-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was peak oxygen 
consumption (VO2). Secondary endpoints included left ventricular (LV) ejection 
fraction and volumes, serum amino terminal fragment of the pro-hormone 
brain-type natriuretic peptide, quality of life, and safety.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients in the GH group and 14 in the control group 
completed the study. In the GH group, peak VO2 improved over the 4-year 
follow-up. The treatment effect was 7.1 ± 0.7 ml/kg/min versus -1.8 ± 0.5 
ml/kg/min in the GH and control groups, respectively. At 4 years, LV ejection 
fraction increased by 10 ± 3% in the GH group, whereas it decreased by 2 ± 5% in 
control patients. The treatment effect on LV end-systolic volume index was -22 ± 
6 ml and 8 ± 3 ml/m(2) in the GH and control groups, respectively (all p < 
0.001). No major adverse events were reported in the patients who received GH.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a preliminary study, the finding suggests a new 
therapeutic approach to a large proportion of GHD patients with CHF.

Institute of Gerontology.

AIM: In elderly patients with dementia, it is known that a loss of independence 
in eating can cause malnutrition, dehydration, a decrease in food consumption 
and the immune function and further worsening of the cognitive function, with an 
increased risk of pneumonia and a shortened life expectancy. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the occurrence of a disturbed eating behavior in 
elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), who 
together comprise the majority of elderly patients with dementia.
METHODS: A total of 233 patients (150 AD patients and 83 VaD patients) who were 
residents of institutions or group homes were enrolled. The patients underwent 
an assessment of eating behavior, a cognitive assessment, a neurological 
examination and measurement of the vital signs. Additionally, statistical 
analyses were performed to compare eating behavior between the patients with AD 
and those with VaD at varying severity of dementia.
RESULTS: A disturbed eating behavior was observed significantly more frequently 
as the severity of dementia increased. The prevalence of difficulty in 
rinsing/gargling and dysphagia increased with the severity of dementia. There 
were differences in the frequency of disturbed eating behavior between the AD 
and VaD patients. Among the patients with mild dementia, the VaD patients 
exhibited a higher incidence of a disturbed eating behavior than the AD 
patients. On the other hand, some behaviors prominent in the patients with 
severe dementia were related to various types of cognitive impairment in the AD 
patients, namely difficulty in beginning a meal, difficulty in maintaining 
attention while eating and difficulty in performing the specific motor skills 
necessary to open food packages. Marked individual differences were observed in 
the mild VaD patients, with a high frequency of disturbed eating behavior and 
dysphagia related to symptoms of neurological deficits. No correlations were 
found with the severity of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Both AD and VaD are types of dementia; however, the frequency of a 
disturbed eating behavior differs greatly between these populations. It is 
necessary to focus on differences in these parameters and also the causes of 
dementia in order to develop effective care techniques for patients with 
dementia.

Alcohol-attributable deaths and years of potential life lost--11 States, 
2006-2010.

Gonzales K, Roeber J, Kanny D, Tran A, Saiki C, Johnson H, Yeoman K, Safranek T, 
Creppage K, Lepp A, Miller T, Tarkhashvili N, Lynch KE, Watson JR, Henderson D, 
Christenson M, Geiger SD; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Excessive alcohol consumption, the fourth leading preventable cause of death in 
the United States, resulted in approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years 
of potential life lost (YPLL) annually during 2006-2010 and cost an estimated 
$223.5 billion in 2006. To estimate state-specific average annual rates of 
alcohol-attributable deaths (AAD) and YPLL caused by excessive alcohol use, 11 
states analyzed 2006-2010 data (the most recent data available) using the CDC 
Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) application. The age-adjusted median AAD 
rate was 28.5 per 100,000 population (range = 50.9 per 100,000 in New Mexico to 
22.4 per 100,000 in Utah). The median YPLL rate was 823 per 100,000 (range = 
1,534 YPLL per 100,000 for New Mexico to 634 per 100,000 in Utah). The majority 
of AAD (median = 70%) and YPLL (median = 82%) were among working-age (20-64 
years) adults. Routine monitoring of alcohol-attributable health outcomes, 
including deaths and YPLL, in states could support the planning and 
implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies recommended by the 
Community Preventive Services Task Force to reduce excessive drinking and 
related harms. Such strategies include increasing the price of alcohol, limiting 
alcohol outlet density, and holding alcohol retailers liable for harms related 
to the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and intoxicated patrons (dram shop 
liability).

Lung transplantation: a treatment option in end-stage lung disease.

Hartert M(1), Senbaklavacin O, Gohrbandt B, Fischer BM, Buhl R, Vahld CF.

Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Department of Hematology, 
Pneumology and Oncology at the University Medical Center of the Johannes 
Gutenberg University Mainz.

BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation is the final treatment option in the end stage 
of certain lung diseases, once all possible conservative treatments have been 
exhausted. Depending on the indication for which lung transplantation is 
performed, it can improve the patient's quality of life (e.g., in emphysema) 
and/ or prolong life expectancy (e.g., in cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
and pulmonary arterial hypertension). The main selection criteria for transplant 
candidates, aside from the underlying pulmonary or cardiopulmonary disease, are 
age, degree of mobility, nutritional and muscular condition, and concurrent 
extrapulmonary disease. The pool of willing organ donors is shrinking, and every 
sixth candidate for lung transplantation now dies while on the waiting list.
METHOD: We reviewed pertinent articles (up to October 2013) retrieved by a 
selective search in Medline and other German and international databases, 
including those of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
(ISHLT), Eurotransplant, the German Institute for Applied Quality Promotion and 
Research in Health-Care (Institut für angewandte Qualitätsförderung und 
Forschung im Gesundheitswesen, AQUA-Institut), and the German Foundation for 
Organ Transplantation (Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation, DSO).
RESULTS: The short- and long-term results have markedly improved in recent 
years: the 1-year survival rate has risen from 70.9% to 82.9%, and the 5-year 
survival rate from 46.9% to 59.6%. The 90-day mortality is 10.0%. The 
postoperative complications include acute (3.4%) and chronic (29.0%) transplant 
rejection, infections (38.0%), transplant failure (24.7%), airway complications 
(15.0%), malignant tumors (15.0%), cardiovascular events (10.9%), and other 
secondary extrapulmonary diseases (29.8%). Bilateral lung transplantation is 
superior to unilateral transplantation (5-year survival rate 57.3% versus 
47.4%).
CONCLUSION: Seamless integration of the various components of treatment will be 
essential for further improvements in outcome. In particular, the follow-up care 
of transplant recipients should always be provided in close cooperation with the 
transplant center.

United States Food and Drug Administration and Department of Defense shelf-life 
extension program of pharmaceutical products: progress and promise.

Research, Division of Product Quality Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20993.

The Department of Defense (DoD)-United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
shelf-life extension program (SLEP) was established in 1986 through an 
intra-agency agreement between the DoD and the FDA to extend the shelf life of 
product nearing expiry. During the early stages of development, special 
attention was paid to program operation, labeling requirements, and the cost 
benefits associated with this program. In addition to the substantial cost 
benefits, the program also provides the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research with significant scientific understanding and pharmaceutical resource. 
As a result of this unique resource, numerous regulatory research opportunities 
to improve public health present themselves from this distinctive scientific 
database, which includes examples of products shelf life, their long-term 
stability issues, and various physical and chemical tests to identify such 
failures. The database also serves as a scientific resource for mechanistic 
understanding and identification of test failures leading to the development of 
new formulations or more robust packaging. It has been recognized that SLEP is 
very important in maintaining both national security and public welfare by 
confirming that the stockpiled pharmaceutical products meet quality standards 
after the "expiration date" assigned by the sponsor. SLEP research is an example 
of regulatory science that is needed to best ensure product performance past the 
original shelf life. The objective of this article is to provide a brief history 
and background and most importantly the public health benefits of the SLEP.

Is walking capacity in subjects with multiple sclerosis primarily related to 
muscle oxidative capacity or maximal muscle strength? A pilot study.

Background and Purpose. Walking capacity is reduced in subjects with multiple 
sclerosis (MS). To develop effective exercise interventions to enhance walking 
capacity, it is important to determine the impact of factors, modifiable by 
exercise intervention (maximal muscle strength versus muscle oxidative 
capacity), on walking capacity. The purpose of this pilot study is to 
discriminate between the impact of maximal muscle strength versus muscle 
oxidative capacity on walking capacity in subjects with MS. Methods. From 24 
patients with MS, muscle oxidative capacity was determined by calculation of 
exercise-onset oxygen uptake kinetics (mean response time) during submaximal 
exercise bouts. Maximal muscle strength (isometric knee extension and flexion 
peak torque) was assessed on dynamometer. All subjects completed a 6-minute 
walking test. Relationships between walking capacity (as a percentage of normal 
value) and muscle strength (of knee flexors and extensors) versus muscle 
oxidative capacity were assessed in multivariate regression analyses. Results. 
The expanded disability status score (EDSS) showed a significant univariate 
correlation (r = -0.70, P < 0.004) with walking capacity. In multivariate 
regression analyses, EDSS and mean response time, but not muscle strength, were 
independently related to walking capacity (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Walking 
distance is, next to disability level and not taking neurologic 
symptoms/deficits into account, primarily related to muscle oxidative capacity 
in subjects with MS. Additional study is needed to further examine/verify these 
findings.

Properties of patient-reported outcome measures in individuals following acute 
whiplash injury.

Author information:
(1)Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical 
School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK. j.pink@warwick.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability, reliability, 
validity and responsiveness of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and its 
preference-based derivative (SF-6D), the EQ-5D and the Neck Disability Index 
(NDI) in patients recovering from acute whiplash injury.
METHODS: Data from the Managing Injuries of the Neck Trial of 3,851 patients 
with acute whiplash injury formed the basis of this empirical investigation. The 
EQ-5D and SF-12 were collected at baseline, and all three outcome measures were 
then collected at 4 months, 8 months and 12 months post-randomisation. The 
measures were assessed for their acceptability (response rates), internal 
consistency, validity (known groups validity and discriminant validity) and 
their internal and external responsiveness.
RESULTS: Response rates were broadly similar across the measures, with evidence 
of a floor effect for the NDI and a ceiling effect for the EQ-5D utility 
measure. All measures had Cronbach's α statistics of greater than 0.7, 
indicating acceptable internal consistency. The NDI and EQ-5D utility score 
correlated more strongly with the physical component scale of the SF-12 than the 
mental component scale, whilst this was reversed for the SF-6D utility score. 
The smaller standard deviations in SF-6D utility scores meant there were larger 
effect sizes for differences in utility score between patients with different 
injury severity at baseline than for the EQ-5D utility measure. However, the 
EQ-5D utility measure and NDI were both more responsive to longitudinal changes 
in health status than the SF-6D.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of differences between the EQ-5D utility 
measure and NDI in terms of their construct validity, discriminant validity or 
responsiveness in patients with acute whiplash injury. However, both 
demonstrated superior responsiveness to longitudinal health changes than the 
SF-6D.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of intra-articular injections of a high molecular 
weight bioengineered hyaluronic acid for the treatment of osteoarthritis knee 
pain.

(1)University of Illinois at Chicago , Chicago, IL , USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of bioengineered hyaluronic acid 
(BioHA, 1% sodium hyaluronate) intra-articular injections in treating 
osteoarthritis knee pain in poor responders to conventional care (CC) including 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics.
METHODS: Two decision analytic models compared BioHA treatment with either 
continuation of patient's baseline CC with no assumption of disease progression 
(Model 1), or CC including escalating care costs due to disease progression 
(NSAIDs and analgesics, corticosteroid injections, and surgery; Model 2). 
Analyses were based on patients who received two courses of 3-weekly 
intra-articular BioHA (26-week FLEXX Trial + 26-week Extension Study). BioHA 
group costs included fees for physician assessment and injection regimen, plus 
half of CC costs. Cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed as averages and 
incremental costs per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses used the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of QALYs gained in BioHA-treated patients, and ±20% of BioHA 
treatment and CC costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 
Model 2.
RESULTS: For 214 BioHA patients, the average utility gain was 0.163 QALYs (95% 
CI = -0.162 to 0.488) over 52 weeks. Model 1 treatment costs were $3469 and 
$4562 for the BioHA and CC groups, respectively; sensitivity analyses showed 
BioHA to be the dominant treatment strategy, except when at the lower end of the 
95% CI. Model 2 annual treatment costs per QALY gained were $1446 and $516 for 
the BioHA and CC groups, respectively. Using CC as baseline strategy, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BioHA was $38,741/QALY gained, 
and was sensitive to response rates in either the BioHA or CC groups.
CONCLUSION: BioHA is less costly and more effective than CC with NSAIDs and 
analgesics, and is the dominant treatment strategy. Compared with escalating CC, 
the $38,741/QALY ICER of BioHA remains within the $50,000 per QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold to adopt a new technology.

Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do 
with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has 
daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of 
concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family 
relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical 
and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of 
life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia 
usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening 
of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia 
in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the 
search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy 
that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended 
to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or 
diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of 
narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The 
consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of 
functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as 
well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.

Publisher: El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; 
también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un 
paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, 
deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así 
como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este 
padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que 
tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. 
Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual 
contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se 
acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con 
el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y 
el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica 
que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es 
recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado 
fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se 
recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o 
benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en 
las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la 
calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de 
las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.

Improvement to the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) brings 
about novel challenges including the need for evaluation of the role of fungi in 
the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. To determine if such organisms represent 
bystanders or pathogens affecting clinical outcomes we review the existing 
knowledge from a clinical, biochemical, inflammatory and immunological 
perspective. The prevalence and importance of fungi in the CF airway has likely 
been underestimated with the most frequently isolated filamentous fungi being 
Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium apiospermum and the major yeast Candida 
albicans. Developing non-culture based microbiological methods for fungal 
detection has improved both our classification and understanding of their 
clinical consequences including localized, allergic and systemic infections. 
Cross-kingdom interaction between bacteria and fungi are discussed as is the 
role of biofilms further affecting clinical outcome. A combination of host and 
pathogen-derived factors determines if a particular fungus represents a 
commensal, colonizer or pathogen in the setting of CF. The underlying immune 
state, disease severity and treatment burden represent key host variables whilst 
fungal type, form, chronicity and virulence including the ability to evade 
immune recognition determines the pathogenic potential of a specific fungus at a 
particular point in time. Further research in this emerging field is warranted 
to fully elucidate the spectrum of disease conferred by the presence of fungi in 
the CF airway and the indications for therapeutic interventions.

Fibrate treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis.

Cuperus FJ(1), Halilbasic E, Trauner M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and 
Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna, Wien, Austria.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) can lead to end-stage liver 
disease and death. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment can normalize serum 
liver enzymes in PBC, and such UDCA-responsive patients have a similar life 
expectancy as age and sex-matched controls. Nearly up to 50% of the patients 
with PBC, depending on sex and age at diagnosis, show an incomplete biochemical 
response to UDCA and require additional/alternative treatment. The purpose of 
this review is to critically evaluate the molecular mechanisms and clinical 
benefit of fibrate treatment in these patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: Fibrates have anticholestatic, anti-inflammatory, and 
antifibrotic effects in animal and in-vitro studies. The mechanisms that 
underlie these effects are complementary, and largely mediated through 
activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors. Fibrate treatment 
ameliorated liver biochemical tests in UDCA unresponsive patients, either as 
mono-therapy or in combination with UDCA. These results, however, were obtained 
in case series and small pilot studies. The results of phase III studies, such 
as the Bezafibrate in Combination With Ursodeoxycholic Acid in Primary Biliary 
Cirrhosis (BEZURSO) trial, are currently awaited.
SUMMARY: A considerable body of observational evidence supports the safety and 
efficacy of fibrate treatment in PBC patients with an incomplete response to 
UDCA. These results encourage the evaluation of its effects on liver-related 
morbidity and mortality in larger clinical trials.

Patient-focused care has been described as an extension of patient-centered 
care, recognizing that patients’ medical needs are best understood and addressed 
in the context of their entire lives, including their life goals and social, 
economic, emotional, and spiritual functioning. Kaiser Permanente is expanding 
its ability to care for members as whole persons, not just as patients, with 
sensitivity to nonmedical factors in planning and delivering care. We describe 
emerging examples in several areas: interdisciplinary care planning, behavior 
change, social care, patient-reported outcome measures, and Total Health. 
Realizing the vision of person-focused care requires taking every opportunity to 
fully recognizing that each patient we serve is first and foremost a person.
