BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with chronic neglected 
tropical diseases (NTDs) has been identified as a significant and overlooked 
contributor to overall disease burden. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of 
the most prevalent and stigmatising NTDs, with an incidence of around 1 million 
new cases of active CL infection annually. However, the characteristic residual 
scarring (inactive CL) following almost all cases of active CL has only recently 
been recognised as part of the CL disease spectrum due to its lasting 
psychosocial impact.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a multi-language systematic review of the 
psychosocial impact of active and inactive CL. We estimated inactive CL (iCL) 
prevalence for the first time using reported WHO active CL (aCL) incidence data 
that were adjusted for life expectancy and underreporting. We then quantified 
the disability (YLD) burden of co-morbid MDD in CL using MDD disability weights 
at three severity levels. Overall, we identified 29 studies of CL psychological 
impact from 5 WHO regions, representing 11 of the 50 highest burden countries 
for CL. We conservatively calculated the disability burden of co-morbid MDD in 
CL to be 1.9 million YLDs, which equalled the overall (DALY) disease burden 
(assuming no excess mortality in depressed CL patients). Thus, upon inclusion of 
co-morbid MDD alone in both active and inactive CL, the DALY burden was seven 
times higher than the latest 2016 Global Burden of Disease study estimates, 
which notably omitted both psychological impact and inactive CL.
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to include co-morbid MDD and the lasting sequelae of 
chronic NTDs, as exemplified by CL, leads to large underestimates of overall 
disease burden.

Integrating Medical and Social Support for Elderly in Hong Kong - System and 
Technology Enabled Service Innovations.

Maw KC, Lo SV, Leung PY.

Hong Kong is proud of its population's long life expectancy, but rapid 
population ageing is one of its greatest challenges. The Hospital Authority (HA) 
is the largest healthcare organization in Hong Kong. To cope with the 
challenges, HA has formulated the "Strategic Service Framework for Elderly 
Patients", emphasizing the development of multidisciplinary integrated elderly 
services, patients and caregivers; engagement, and enhancing collaboration with 
community partners. Over the past few years. HA has innovated and re-engineered 
various service models to provide appropriate care based on the stratified needs 
of individual elderly patients. We have adopted an integrated case management 
approach to cater for the multi-faceted needs of high risk elderly, enhanced 
chronic disease management and improved support for self-care. Information 
technology has played a significant role in transforming the service model. 
Evaluation of the new programmers showed encouraging results in reduction of 
unnecessary hospitalizations, improvements in health outcomes and patient 
empowerment.

Substantial evidence shows that physical inactivity (PI) and sedentary behavior 
(SB) increases the risk of many chronic diseases and shortens life expectancy. 
We describe evidence that certain domains of physical activity (PA) in the 
United States (US) population have declined substantially over 5 decades. The 
prevalence of PI is very high worldwide, which has contributed to 6%-10% of the 
burden of many chronic diseases and premature mortality. Reduction or 
elimination of PI would likely produce substantial increases in life expectancy 
of the world's population. Great efforts are needed to reduce PI and SB and 
increase levels of PA in the US and worldwide.

The Hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin, licensed in China) harbors a potent 
particulate immunogen, p239, designed from a 26-aa N-terminal extension of its 
poorly immunogenic parental protein, E2. Although an effective vaccine, we 
sought to design a fusion protein in a non-particulate form that could improve 
the delivery and immunogenicity of E2 epitopes. The non-toxic mutant of 
diphtheria toxin, CRM197 (Cross-Reacting Material 197) has been successfully 
used as a carrier protein for conjugated vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity 
of polysaccharides. Here, we designed a fusion non-particulate protein of E2 and 
the catalytic domain (fragment A) of CRM197 and evaluated its antigenicity, 
immunogenicity and disease prevention efficacy in primates. This fusion protein, 
named CRM197(A)-E2, was bacterially expressed and purified by chromatography. 
CRM197(A)-E2 presented as a homodimer in solution, similar to its parental E2 
protein, and exhibited excellent antigenicity against representative 
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, like E2 and p239. However, CRM197(A)-E2 
manifested higher immunogenicity in mice compared with that achieved by the 
particulate p239, as indicated by the 10-times lower ED50 value and 2-log higher 
HEV-specific antibody level that could persist for at least 28 weeks. In 
addition, both the 1 μg and 10 μg doses of CRM197(A)-E2 adjuvanted with aluminum 
could protect vaccinated monkeys against HEV challenge, matching that achieved 
with only the higher (10 μg) dose of the p239 vaccine. These results suggest 
that the CRM197 fragment A alone serves as an intra-molecular adjuvant to 
remarkably enhance the immunogenicity of the target of interest in a 
non-particulate form. These findings may pave the way for rational vaccine 
design, especially in cases where particulates are not accessible.

BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a well-established surgical 
intervention for stroke prevention in patients with carotid stenosis of all 
ages. However, the decision to proceed to operate in the elderly involves a more 
complicated risk-benefit assessment due in part to increased comorbidities and 
reduced life expectancy. Some studies suggest that CEA is more risky in the 
elderly with worse outcomes, whereas others have found no difference. Our 
objective was to evaluate and compare outcomes of CEA between elderly and 
younger patients at our institution.
METHODS: All hospital charts were reviewed for consecutive patients undergoing 
CEA from the Jewish General Hospital and the Royal Victoria Hospital from 
October 2009 to December 2015. Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke, death, 
and restenosis at 30 days and 1 year. Secondary outcomes were cranial nerve 
injury, myocardial infarction (MI), hematoma, wound infection, cerebral 
hyperperfusion, and transient ischemic attacks within 30 days. Primary and 
secondary outcomes were compared between patients aged ≥80 years and <80 years.
RESULTS: A total of 361 patients were included in this study with a mean age of 
70.2 ± 9.5 years (n = 247 [68.4%] male and n = 272 [75.8%] symptomatic). Elderly 
patients were more often symptomatic (93.8% vs. 71.6%, P < 0.0001) and had an 
increased length of stay (2.8 ± 5.3 vs. 1.6 ± 1.8, P = 0.001). There was no 
statistically significant difference in primary outcomes between patients aged 
<80 years and ≥80 years, including 30-day stroke (1.7% vs. 0%), death (no deaths 
in either group), restenosis (8.8% vs. 12.3%), 1-year stroke (1.7% vs. 0%), 
death (0.7% vs. 0%), or restenosis (14.9% vs. 13.8%). However, elderly patients 
had significantly increased MI risk postoperatively (4.6% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.01). 
Other complications, including cranial nerve injury (3.7% in <80 years vs. 4.6% 
in the elderly group), were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that CEA in the elderly does not have an increased risk of 
stroke or death up to one year postoperatively. However, the postoperative 
length of stay is increased and complicated by significantly more MIs, which 
should weigh into the decision of whether to perform CEA on an elderly patient.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to establish normative data for holistic 
health parameters in the general Korean population and to investigate the factor 
associated with ideal life expectancy (ILE) among these holistic health 
parameters and sociodemographic variables.
METHODS: This study used a questionnaire to obtain self-reported physical, 
mental, social, spiritual, and general health status and then evaluated their 
association with ILE. A total of 1,241 individuals responded to the 
questionnaire, from which we established a multidimensional health status 
reference data set representing the Korean population. To explain factors 
associated with ILE, we stratified results by age and gender and performed 
multiple logistic regression of sociodemographic variables and multidimensional 
health status.
RESULTS: Women reported poor health status more frequently for all five health 
categories. The average ILE was 87.46 years versus 84.42 years of life 
expectancy in the general Korean population. Single marital status, higher 
income, and better social health were significantly associated with higher ILE.
CONCLUSION: ILE could be a good indicator reflecting social wellness in a 
certain society. Comprehensive social health promotion programs can improve 
individuals' attitudes toward life expectancy, especially for vulnerable groups.

This study aimed to evaluate a polyphenol extract from olive oil by-product, to 
improve the preservation of "Fior di latte" cheese during storage. Nine batches 
of "Fior di latte" cheese were manufactured in a local dairy production plant: 
three batches treated with 250 μg/mL of phenols from olive oil by-products in 
the governing liquid; three batches treated with 500 μg/mL of phenols in the 
governing liquid, and three untreated batches as the control group. The phenols 
effectively retarded the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens and 
Enterobacteriaceae, acting mainly on the lag phase of the microorganisms, 
resulting in the prolongation of the time needed to reach the acceptable 
microbial limit. The delay in the growth of the spoilage bacteria was considered 
to indirectly influence the sensorial acceptability threshold, recorded through 
survival analysis. The combination of the two above-mentioned factors promotes 
the extension of "Fior di latte" cheese shelf life. by >2 and 4 days, for PA and 
PB respectively.

Introduction: Breast cancer is a major threat to women’s health and a common 
factor that can reduce their life expectancy. Complementary medicine such as 
reflexology is known to reduce fatigue severity in cancer patients. The present 
study aimed to cultivate the effect of reflexology on fatigue severity of 
patients with breast cancer. Methods: The present pre-post clinical trial 
recruited 57 patients with breast cancer and involved an experimental and a 
control group. All patients were livening in Ilam, Iran. Patients were randomly 
assigned to two groups of experimental (N=27) and control (N=30). The 
experimental group received reflexology for 4 sessions. Data were collected 
using Fatigue severity scale (FSS) and demographic information questionnaire. 
FSS was completed by the patients twice; before the intervention and 2 months 
after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS and running t-test and 
ANOVA. Results: Results showed no significant difference in fatigue severity 
between experimental (45.44±5.30) and control (43.66±7.68) groups prior to the 
intervention (p>0.05). However, after conducting the intervention, a significant 
difference in fatigue severity was seen between the experimental (20.66±4.54) 
and control (40.36±9.58) groups (p=0.000). Conclusion: The present study showed 
that reflexology decrease fatigue severity in patients with breast cancer and 
community health nursing can to use of these complementary medicine to increase 
patients health conditions.

Background: Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus and is a 
leading cause of cancer death among young Korean women. Current screening 
programmes could benefit from the addition of HPV vaccination into their 
schedule to help reduce disease burden. Two-dose vaccination schedules targeting 
HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for most cervical cancer cases, have 
recently been approved. Of the two available vaccines, AS04-adjuvanted HPV16/18 
vaccine (AS04-HPV16/18v) provides greater protection against non-vaccine 
oncogenic HPV, while HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (4vHPVv) provides protection against 
genital warts. Methods: The health and economic consequences of introducing a 
two-dose HPV vaccination programme in 12-year-old girls together with screening 
were assessed in the Korean healthcare setting using a previously-published 
Markov model. Results: Compared with screening alone, AS04-HPV16/18v was 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below and within the Korean 
Won [KRW] 20-30 million treshold). When comparing the two vaccines, at 3% 
discount rate, AS04-HPV16/18v dominated 4vHPVv (i.e., provided 174 more 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 304 more life-years (LYs) and cost-savings 
of KRW 980 million). At a 5% discount rate, AS04-HPV16/18v provided comparable 
QALYs (albeit 5 fewer), 105 more LYs and cost-savings of KRW 292 million 
compared with 4vHPVv. Results were particularly sensitive to the discount rate 
used, as the health benefits of preventing cervical cancer are observed much 
later than those of preventing genital warts. Conclusion: For the Korean 
setting, HPV vaccination with a two-dose schedule is a cost-effective option, 
and AS04-HPV16/18v is likely to offer better health outcomes at a cost-saving 
compared with 4vHPVv.

Devicing future populations: Problematizing the relationship between quantity 
and quality of life.

Moreira T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Sociology, Durham University, Durham, UK.

Taking as point of departure the claim that, in late modern societies, there has 
been shift from a focus on producing measures of life and death towards metrics 
of health and disability, this paper investigates how, through what means and 
processes was this transition achieved. It proposes that such questions can be 
addressed by analysing the transcripts and sociotechnical network of a meeting 
held at the United States Senate on July 15th 1983 to assess the validity and 
sensitivity of life expectancy forecasts. The paper analyses how members of the 
Hearing transformed a weakly articulated set of differing life expectancy 
projections into a controversy about the issue of vitality and health in 
populations. Analysis of the Hearing proceedings suggests that 'calculative 
devices' played a generative role in problematizing the relationship between 
forms of expertise, calculative procedures, data infrastructures and specific 
expectations of the effect of technology on health and longevity. The paper 
details empirically that this re-composition was possible through a collective 
investigation - an opening up - of key instruments in the management of 
populations in 'insurance societies'.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Skin extension by multiple incisions (SEMI) may be superior to 
split-thickness skin graft (STSG) for closure of large soft tissue defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients who had undergone STSG were compared 
to 29 patients who had undergone SEMI on the extremities. Patient and Observer 
Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Dermatology Life Quality Index, Wound QoL 
(Quality of Life) and Short Form Health Survey 36 were used. Elasticity, 
thickness and skin sensation were compared between the treated and contralateral 
extremity. Range of motion in adjacent joints was measured. Complication rates 
were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients with a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range=2-9 
years) were examined. Patients with STSG had significantly worse scores in 
POSAS. The scar was thinner, less elastic and did not provide intact 
sensibility. Other scores, ROM and complication rates did not differ 
significantly.
CONCLUSION: SEMI was superior to STSG regarding patient satisfaction and scar 
quality.

Hydrodynamic modelling of Australia's lower Murray River demonstrates the 
response of a large coastal plain estuary to the mid-Holocene (7,000-6,000 yr 
BP) sea-level highstand. The approximately two metre higher-than-present sea 
level during the highstand forced the estuarine limit upstream generating an 
extensive central basin environment extending more than 200 kilometres from the 
river mouth (143 kilometres upstream of the modern tidal limit). The geomorphic 
history of the region does not conform to conventional estuarine facies models 
as, for much of the Holocene, the lower Murray River acted as a landward, 
gorge-confined extension of the Murray estuary. The incredibly low relief of 
this coastal plain system drove significant saline incursion and limited current 
velocities across the estuary facilitating deposition of a laminated silt-clay 
sequence which our results suggest may be regionally extensive. Variations to 
discharge, barrier morphology, or the estuary's bathymetry result in minimal 
change to the estuarine palaeo-environment. The shift to the present-day fresher 
water distribution in the Murray estuary requires a fall in sea level to 
present-day conditions. The dominance of sea level as the controlling factor on

Prokaryotes have the ability to walk on surfaces using type IV pili (TFP), a 
motility mechanism known as twitching1,2. Molecular motors drive TFP extension 
and retraction, but whether and how these movements are coordinated is unknown3. 
Here, we reveal how the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the 
motorized activity of TFP to power efficient surface motility. To do this, we 
dynamically visualized TFP extension, attachment and retraction events at high 
resolution in four dimensions using label-free interferometric scattering 
microscopy (iSCAT)4. By measuring TFP dynamics, we found that the retraction 
motor PilT was sufficient to generate tension and power motility in free 
solution, while its partner ATPase PilU may improve retraction only in 
high-friction environments. Using precise timing of successive attachment and 
retraction, we show that P. aeruginosa engages PilT motors very rapidly and 
almost only when TFP encounter the surface, suggesting contact sensing. Finally, 
measurements of TFP dwell times on surfaces show that tension reinforced the 
adhesion strength to the surface of individual pili, thereby increasing 
effective pulling time during retraction. The successive control of TFP 
extension, attachment, retraction and detachment suggests that sequential 
control of motility machinery is a conserved strategy for optimized locomotion 
across domains of life.

Stress in Sunflower.

Plant Improvement Institute (SPII), Agricultural Research, Education, and 
Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the important vegetable 
oil supplies in the world and in Iran, as well. It is classified as a drought 
semi-tolerant crop; however, its yield is adversely affected by drought stress. 
Understanding the initial events in sensing stress and the related physiologic 
and biochemical events thereafter, is crucial in designing drought stress 
breeding programs. Transcription factors are master molecules directly involved 
in the plant responses under drought stress, from signal perception and 
transduction to the regulation of physiologic processes.
OBJECTIVE: The expression pattern of some bZip transcription factors in response 
to osmotic stress was investigated in sunflower.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Employing real-time PCR to monitor, the response of 10 
bZIP transcription factors was performed under different osmotic stress 
conditions including -0.3, 0.9, and 1.2 MPa. Whole seedling was sampled at 6, 
12, and 24 h after the osmotic condition application.
RESULTS: Exposure to osmotic potential of 0.9 MPa for 24 h caused a reduction in 
the fresh weight of the seedling. Among the evaluated genes, eight genes, 
bz-497, bz-502, bz-485, bz-499, bz-492, bz-504, bz-505, and bz-509 appeared as 
the osmotic stress responsive transcription factor. Changes in the expression of 
the genes under 0.3 MPa was observed for four genes. Most of the osmotic 
responsive genes appeared to be up-regulated. Most of responsiveness in the gene 
expression was happened under 0.9 MPa of the osmotic stress which is 
corresponding to fresh weight reduction in the seedlings. Among the investigated 
genes, two genes was identified to have possible roles in sensitive response of 
sunflower against drought stress.
CONCLUSIONS: It was a focus to have systemic view on the complex response of the 
plant to abiotic stress, and avoidance of the single gene analysis. Also, the 
importance of molecular data in molecular breeding procedures toward achievement 
of the stress tolerant lines was highlighted.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a condition that often results in 
severe infections and death at young age. Early detection shortly after birth, 
followed by treatment before infections occur, largely increases the chances of 
survival. As the incidence of SCID is low, assessing cost-effectiveness of 
adding screening for SCID to the newborn screening program is relevant for 
decision making. Lifetime costs and effects of newborn screening for SCID were 
compared to a situation without screening in the Netherlands in a decision 
analysis model. Model parameters were based on literature and expert opinions. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed. Due to earlier detection, the number of 
deaths due to SCID per 100,000 children was assessed to decrease from 0.57 to 
0.23 and a number of 11.7 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was 
expected. Total yearly healthcare costs, including costs of screening, 
diagnostics, and treatment, were €390,800 higher in a situation with screening 
compared to a situation without screening, resulting in a cost-utility ratio of 
€33,400 per QALY gained.Conclusion: Newborn screening for SCID might be 
cost-effective. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty around the 
cost-effectiveness estimate. Pilot screening projects are warranted to obtain 
more accurate estimates for the European situation. What is Known: • Severe 
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a condition that often results in severe 
infections and death at a young age. • As the incidence of SCID is low, 
assessing cost-effectiveness of adding screening for SCID to the newborn 
screening program is needed. What is New: • Newborn screening for SCID is 
expected to reduce mortality from 0.57 to 0.23 per 100,000 children at 
additional healthcare costs of €390,800. The cost-utility ratio is €33,400 per 
QALY gained. • Due to large uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates, 
pilot screening projects are warranted for Europe.

Legacy environmental polychlorinated biphenyl contamination attenuates the acute 
stress response in a cartilaginous fish, the Round Stingray.

In a population of Round Stingrays (Urobatis halleri) sampled from mainland 
California (polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB] exposed site, n = 46), relative to a 
nearby offshore island (reference site, n = 34), we tested the hypothesis that 
stingrays from the PCB-exposed site would have a compromised stress response. 
Adult male and pregnant female (pregnancy = matrotrophic histotrophy), stingrays 
were captured via hook and line at both locations over a breeding season and 
plasma was sampled either immediately (Baseline, males = 10, females = 31), or 
after ∼5 min of struggle on the line followed by a 15 min confinement stressor 
(Stressed, males = 16, females = 23). Biomarkers of the primary stress response 
(1α-OH-corticosterone) and the secondary response (energy mobilization; glucose, 
glycogen, and lactate in liver and muscle) were assessed. Females from both 
sites demonstrated the expected primary stress response of 1α-OH-corticosterone 
elevation, but the contaminant-exposed males did not. PCB-exposed stingrays, 
regardless of sex, failed to produce a plasma glucose increase in response to 
the applied stress, even though the stressor increased liver glucose as 
expected. This suggests a dysfunction in glucose transport due to PCB exposure. 
The Round Stingray accumulates lower PCB loads than other, predatory 
elasmobranchs, and by extension, the stress axis effects could be more severely 
impacted in those species as well. Lay summary Legacy polychlorinated biphenyl 
(PCB) contamination continues to adversely affect marine life. We show that 
PCB-exposure interferes with the ability of pregnant female and adult male 
stingrays to mobilize the energy necessary to respond appropriately to an acute 
stress like capture. Other cartilaginous fish species, such as sharks, 
accumulate considerably more PCB as a result of their predatory diet, and are 
likely to be more adversely impacted.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and 
has a 5-year life expectancy of ~8%. Currently, only a few drugs have been 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for pancreatic cancer 
treatment. Despite available drug therapy and ongoing clinical investigations, 
the high prevalence and mortality associated with pancreatic cancer mean that 
there is an unmet chemopreventive and therapeutic need. From ongoing studies 
with various novel formulations, it is evident that the development of smart 
drug delivery systems will improve delivery of drug cargo to the pancreatic 
target site to ensure and enhance the therapeutic/chemoprevention efficacy of 
existing drugs and newly designed drugs in the future. With this in view, 
nanotechnology is emerging as a promising avenue to enhance drug delivery to the 
pancreas via both passive and active targeting mechanisms. Research in this 
field has grown extensively over the past decade, as is evident from available 
scientific literature. This review summarizes the recent advances that have 
brought nanotechnology-based formulations to the forefront of pancreatic cancer 
treatment.

Neurodegenerative disorders are related to the progressive functional loss of 
the brain, often connected to emotional and physical disability and, ultimately, 
to death. These disorders, strongly connected to the aging process, are becoming 
increasingly more relevant due to the increase of life expectancy. Current 
pharmaceutical treatments poorly tackle these diseases, mainly acting only on 
their symptomology. One of the main reasons of this is the current drug 
development process, which is not only expensive and time-consuming but, also, 
still strongly relies on animal models at the preclinical stage. Organ-on-a-chip 
platforms have the potential to strongly impact and improve the drug screening 
process by recreating in vitro the functionality of human organs. 
Patient-derived neurons from different regions of the brain can be directly 
grown and differentiated on a brain-on-a-chip device where the disease 
development, progression and pharmacological treatments can be studied and 
monitored in real time. The model reliability is strongly improved by using 
human-derived cells, more relevant than animal models for pharmacological 
screening and disease monitoring. The selected cells will be then capable of 
proliferating and organizing themselves in the in vivo environment thanks to the 
device architecture, materials selection and bio-chemical functionalization. In 
this review, we start by presenting the fundamental strategies adopted for 
brain-on-a-chip devices fabrication including e.g., photolithography, 
micromachining and 3D printing technology. Then, we discuss the state-of-theart 
of brain-on-a-chip platforms including their role in the study of the functional 
architecture of the brain e.g., blood-brain barrier, or of the most diffuse 
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. At last, the 
current limitations and future perspectives of this approach for the development 
of new drugs and neurodegenerative diseases modeling will be discussed.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and total lifetime societal costs for a hypothetical cohort of 
Australians with multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: A 4-state Markov model simulated progression from no/mild to moderate 
and severe disability and death for a cohort of 35-year-old women over a 
lifetime horizon. Death risks were calculated from Australian life tables, 
adjusted by disability severity. State-dependent relapse probabilities and 
associated disutilities were considered. Probabilities of MS progression and 
relapse were estimated from AusLong and TasMSL MS epidemiological databases. 
Annual societal (direct and indirect) costs (2017 Australian dollars) and 
health-state utilities for each state were derived from the Australian MS 
Longitudinal Study. Costs were discounted at 5% annually.
RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) LE from age 35 years was 42.7 
(41.6-43.8) years. This was 7.5 years less than the general Australian 
population. Undiscounted QALYs were 28.2 (26.3-30.0), a loss of 13.1 QALYs 
versus the Australian population. Discounted lifetime costs were $942,754 
($347,856-$2,820,219).
CONCLUSION: We have developed a health economics model of the progression of MS, 
calculating the impact of MS on LE, QALYs and lifetime costs in Australia. It 
will form the basis for future cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions for 
MS.

BACKGROUND: Clozapine (clozaril, Mylan Products Ltd) is a first-choice treatment 
for people with schizophrenia who have a poor response to standard antipsychotic 
medication. However, a significant number of patients who trial clozapine have 
an inadequate response and experience persistent symptoms, called 
clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (CRS). There is little evidence regarding the 
clinical effectiveness of pharmacological or psychological interventions for 
this population.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with CRS and to identify factors 
predicting outcome.
DESIGN: The Focusing on Clozapine Unresponsive Symptoms (FOCUS) trial was a 
parallel-group, randomised, outcome-blinded evaluation trial. Randomisation was 
undertaken using permuted blocks of random size via a web-based platform. Data 
were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, using random-effects 
regression adjusted for site, age, sex and baseline symptoms. Cost-effectiveness 
analyses were carried out to determine whether or not CBT was associated with a 
greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and higher costs than 
treatment as usual (TAU).
SETTING: Secondary care mental health services in five cities in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: People with CRS aged ≥ 16 years, with an International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) schizophrenia spectrum 
diagnoses and who are experiencing psychotic symptoms.
INTERVENTIONS: Individual CBT included up to 30 hours of therapy delivered over 
9 months. The comparator was TAU, which included care co-ordination from 
secondary care mental health services.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 21 months and the primary secondary 
outcome was PANSS total score at the end of treatment (9 months post 
randomisation). The health benefit measure for the economic evaluation was the 
QALY, estimated from the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L), 
health status measure. Service use was measured to estimate costs.
RESULTS: Participants were allocated to CBT (n = 242) or TAU (n = 245). There 
was no significant difference between groups on the prespecified primary outcome 
[PANSS total score at 21 months was 0.89 points lower in the CBT arm than in the 
TAU arm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.32 to 1.55 points; p = 0.475], although 
PANSS total score at the end of treatment (9 months) was significantly lower in 
the CBT arm (-2.40 points, 95% CI -4.79 to -0.02 points; p = 0.049). CBT was 
associated with a net cost of £5378 (95% CI -£13,010 to £23,766) and a net QALY 
gain of 0.052 (95% CI 0.003 to 0.103 QALYs) compared with TAU. The 
cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis indicated a low likelihood that CBT 
was cost-effective, in the primary and sensitivity analyses (probability < 50%). 
In the CBT arm, 107 participants reported at least one adverse event (AE), 
whereas 104 participants in the TAU arm reported at least one AE (odds ratio 
1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.46; p = 0.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioural therapy for CRS was not superior to TAU on 
the primary outcome of total PANSS symptoms at 21 months, but was superior on 
total PANSS symptoms at 9 months (end of treatment). CBT was not found to be 
cost-effective in comparison with TAU. There was no suggestion that the addition 
of CBT to TAU caused adverse effects. Future work could investigate whether or 
not specific therapeutic techniques of CBT have value for some CRS individuals, 
how to identify those who may benefit and how to ensure that effects on symptoms 
can be sustained.
