This study used a simulation model to determine the cost-effective threshold of 
fracture risk to treat osteoporosis among elderly Chinese women. Osteoporosis 
treatment is cost-effective among average-risk women who are at least 75 years 
old and above-average-risk women who are younger than 75 years old.
INTRODUCTION: Aging of the Chinese population is imposing increasing economic 
burden of osteoporosis. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
osteoporosis treatment among the senior Chinese women population.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model using age-specific probabilities of 
hip fracture, clinical vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, humerus fracture, and 
other fracture; costs (2015 US dollars); and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. The willingness to pay (WTP) for 
a QALY in China was compared with the calculated ICER to decide the 
cost-effectiveness. To determine the absolute 10-year hip fracture probability 
at which the osteoporosis treatment became cost-effective, average age-specific 
probabilities for all fractures were multiplied by a relative risk (RR) that was 
systematically varied from 0 to 10 until the WTP threshold was observed for 
treatment relative to no intervention. Sensitivity analyses were also performed 
to evaluate the impacts from WTP and annual treatment costs.
RESULTS: In baseline analysis, simulated ICERs were higher than the WTP 
threshold among Chinese women younger than 75, but much lower than the WTP among 
the older population. Sensitivity analyses indicated that cost-effectiveness 
could vary due to a higher WTP threshold or a lower annual treatment cost. A 
30 % increase in WTP or a 30 % reduction in annual treatment costs will make 
osteoporosis treatment cost-effective for Chinese women population from 55 to 
85.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that osteoporosis treatment is 
cost-effective among a subpopulation of Chinese senior women. The results also 
indicate that the cost-effectiveness of using osteoporosis treatment is 
sensitive to the WTP threshold and annual treatment costs.

Medicine, Tsinghua University.

Obesity-related renal diseases have been a worldwide issue. Effective strategy 
that prevents high fat-diet induced renal damage is of great significance. 
Resveratrol, a natural plant polyphenol, is famous for its antioxidant activity, 
cardioprotective effects and anticancer properties. However whether resveratrol 
can play a role in the treatment of renal diseases is unknown. In this study, we 
added resveratrol in normal glucose or high glucose medium and provide evidences 
that resveratrol protects against high-glucose triggered oxidative stress and 
cell senescence. Moreover, mice were fed with standard diet, standard diet plus 
resveratrol, high-fat diet or high-fat diet plus resveratrol for 3 months, and 
results show that resveratrol treatment prevents high-fat diet induced renal 
pathological damage by activating SIRT1, a key member in the mammalian sirtuin 
family that response to calorie restriction life-extension method. This research 
confirms the potential role of resveratrol in the treatment of renal diseases 
and may provide an effective and convenient method to mimic the beneficial 
effects of calorie restriction.

Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis.

S5 7AU.

Update in
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Sep 05;9:CD006682.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in 
cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased 
dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is 
the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial 
infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not 
clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 
days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of 
antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to 
further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive 
and inconvenient and the incidence of allergic reactions to antibiotics also 
increases with prolonged courses. The use of aminoglycosides requires frequent 
monitoring to avoid some of their side effects. However, some organisms which 
infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi-resistant to 
antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of 
previously published reviews.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for 
treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive 
electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books 
and conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis 
Trials Register: 05 May 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing 
different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory 
exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, 
the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics 
altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No eligible trials were identified.
MAIN RESULTS: No eligible trials were identified.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of 
intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on 
unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should 
improve quality of life and compliance; result in a reduced incidence of drug 
reactions; and be less costly. However, this may not be sufficient to clear a 
chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This 
systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled 
trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it 
has important clinical and financial implications.

PURPOSE: National Comprehensive Cancer Network prostate cancer guidelines for 
the prediction of life expectancy recommend subtracting 50% of life table 
predicted longevity for those in the lowest quartile of health. However, it is 
unclear how to identify these men and if their survival is uniform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sampled records of 1,482 men diagnosed with prostate 
cancer from 1998 to 2004 at 2 VA hospitals. We identified men in the lowest 
quartile of health by age using Charlson scores, calculated their NCCN predicted 
life expectancy, and compared this with observed median survival in aggregate 
and across comorbidity subgroups.
RESULTS: Men with Charlson scores of 2+ (age less than 75 years) and 3+ (age 
75 years or older) comprised the lowest quartile of health. Among those younger 
than 65, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79 and 80 years or older, observed survival 
vs NCCN predicted life expectancy in years was similar at 10.4 vs 11.1, 10.0 vs 
7.8, 6.2 vs 6.4, 4.4 vs 4.9 and 3.7 vs 3.3, respectively. Yet within the lowest 
quartile there was significant heterogeneity in survival among men with 
differing Charlson scores. For example, men age 65 to 69 years with Charlson 
scores 2, 3 and 4+ had an observed median survival greater than 13.3, 9.4 and 
4.3 years, respectively. NCCN guidelines misclassified 10-year life expectancy 
in 24% and 56% of men age less than 65 and 65 to 69 years, and 5-year life 
expectancy in 18% of men age 70 to 74 years.
CONCLUSIONS: While NCCN predictions matched observed survival on average for the 
lowest quartile of health, there was substantial heterogeneity in survival by 
Charlson scores. More granular assessments of life expectancy should be used for 
those at highest risk for mortality.

BACKGROUND: Intensive treatment (IT) of cardiovascular risk factors can halve 
mortality among people with established type 2 diabetes but the effects of 
treatment earlier in the disease trajectory are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial 
treatment of screen-detected diabetes.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, cluster-randomised, parallel-group trial.
SETTING: Three hundred and forty-three general practices in Denmark, the 
Netherlands, and Cambridge and Leicester, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 40-69 years with screen-detected diabetes.
INTERVENTIONS: Screening plus routine care (RC) according to national guidelines 
or IT comprising screening and promotion of target-driven intensive management 
(medication and promotion of healthy lifestyles) of hyperglycaemia, blood 
pressure and cholesterol.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was a composite of first 
cardiovascular event (cardiovascular mortality/morbidity, revascularisation and 
non-traumatic amputation) during a mean [standard deviation (SD)] follow-up of 
5.3 (1.6) years. Secondary end points were (1) all-cause mortality; (2) 
microvascular outcomes (kidney function, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy); 
and (3) patient-reported outcomes (health status, well-being, quality of life, 
treatment satisfaction). Economic analyses estimated mean costs (UK 2009/10 
prices) and quality-adjusted life-years from an NHS perspective. We extrapolated 
data to 30 years using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study outcomes model [version 
1.3; (©) Isis Innovation Ltd 2010; see www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/outcomesmodel (accessed 
27 January 2016)].
RESULTS: We included 3055 (RC, n = 1377; IT, n = 1678) of the 3057 recruited 
patients [mean (SD) age 60.3 (6.9) years] in intention-to-treat analyses. 
Prescription of glucose-lowering, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication 
increased in both groups, more so in the IT group than in the RC group. There 
were clinically important improvements in cardiovascular risk factors in both 
study groups. Modest but statistically significant differences between groups in 
reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure and cholesterol 
favoured the IT group. The incidence of first cardiovascular event [IT 7.2%, 
13.5 per 1000 person-years; RC 8.5%, 15.9 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 
0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.05] and all-cause mortality (IT 
6.2%, 11.6 per 1000 person-years; RC 6.7%, 12.5 per 1000 person-years; hazard 
ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21) did not differ between groups. At 5 years, 
albuminuria was present in 22.7% and 24.4% of participants in the IT and RC 
groups, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07), retinopathy in 
10.2% and 12.1%, respectively (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10), and neuropathy in 
4.9% and 5.9% (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34), respectively. The estimated 
glomerular filtration rate increased between baseline and follow-up in both 
groups (IT 4.31 ml/minute; RC 6.44 ml/minute). Health status, well-being, 
diabetes-specific quality of life and treatment satisfaction did not differ 
between the groups. The intervention cost £981 per patient and was not 
cost-effective at costs ≥ £631 per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with RC, IT was associated with modest increases in 
prescribed treatment, reduced levels of risk factors and non-significant 
reductions in cardiovascular events, microvascular complications and death over 
5 years. IT did not adversely affect patient-reported outcomes. IT was not 
cost-effective but might be if delivered at a reduced cost. The lower than 
expected event rate, heterogeneity of intervention delivery between centres and 
improvements in general practice diabetes care limited the achievable 
differences in treatment between groups. Further follow-up to assess the legacy 
effects of early IT is warranted.

Old-age survival is a good indicator of population health and regional 
development. We evaluated the spatial distribution of old-age survival across 
Porto neighbourhoods and its relation with physical (biogeophysical and built) 
and socioeconomic factors (deprivation). Smoothed survival rates and odds ratio 
(OR) were estimated using Bayesian spatial models. There were important 
geographical differentials in the chances of survival after 75 years of age. 
Socioeconomic deprivation strongly impacted old-age survival (Men: least 
deprived areas OR=1.31(1.05-1.63); Women OR=1.53(1.24-1.89)), explaining over 
40% of the spatial variance. Walkability and biogeophysical environment were 
unrelated to old-age survival and also unrelated to socioeconomic deprivation, 
being fairly evenly distributed through the city.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is 
punctuated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and recurrent pulmonary 
exacerbations, and is the major determinant of a patient's life expectancy. With 
the advent of novel deep-sequencing techniques, polymicrobial bacterial 
assemblages rather than single pathogens seem to be responsible for the 
deterioration of pulmonary function. This review summarizes recent insights into 
the development of the CF respiratory tract microbiome, with its determinants 
and its relations to clinical parameters.
RECENT FINDINGS: Research has moved from microbiota snapshots to intensive 
sampling over time, in an attempt to identify biomarkers of progression of CF 
lung disease. The developing respiratory tract microbiota in CF is perturbed by 
various endogenous and exogenous factors from the first months of life on. This 
work has revealed that both major pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and newly 
discovered players such as anaerobic species seem to contribute to CF lung 
disease. However, their interrelations remain to be unraveled.
SUMMARY: Long-term follow-up of microbiome development and alterations in 
relation to progression of lung disease and treatment is recommended. Moreover, 
integrating this information with other systems such as the metabolome, genome, 
mycome and virome is likely to contribute significantly to insights into 
host-microbiome interactions and thereby CF lung disease pathogenesis.

IMPORTANCE: Preclinical studies show that arginine deprivation is synthetically 
lethal in argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1)-negative cancers, including 
mesothelioma. The role of the arginine-lowering agent pegylated arginine 
deiminase (ADI-PEG20) has not been evaluated in a randomized and 
biomarker-driven study among patients with cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical impact of arginine depletion in patients with 
ASS1-deficient malignant pleural mesothelioma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter phase 2 randomized clinical 
trial, the Arginine Deiminase and Mesothelioma (ADAM) study, was conducted 
between March 2, 2011, and May 21, 2013, at 8 academic cancer centers. 
Immunohistochemical screening of 201 patients (2011-2013) identified 68 with 
advanced ASS1-deficient malignant pleural mesothelioma.
INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 2:1 to arginine deprivation (ADI-PEG20, 36.8 mg/m2, 
weekly intramuscular) plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival 
(PFS) assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
(target hazard ratio, 0.60). Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), 
tumor response rate, safety, and quality of life, analyzed by intention to 
treat. We measured plasma arginine and citrulline levels, anti-ADI-PEG20 
antibody titer, ASS1 methylation status, and metabolic response by 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography.
RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up in 68 adults (median [range] age, 66 [48-83] 
years; 19% female) was 38 (2.5-39) months. The PFS hazard ratio was 0.56 (95% 
CI, 0.33-0.96), with a median of 3.2 months in the ADI-PEG20 group vs 2.0 months 
in the BSC group (P = .03) (absolute risk, 18% vs 0% at 6 months). Best response 
at 4 months (modified RECIST) was stable disease: 12 of 23 (52%) in the 
ADI-PEG20 group vs 2 of 9 (22%) in the BSC group (P = .23). The OS curves 
crossed, so life expectancy was used: 15.7 months in the ADI-PEG20 group vs 12.1 
months in the BSC group (difference of 3.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to 8.1] months; 
P = .13). The incidence of symptomatic adverse events of grade at least 3 was 11 
of 44 (25%) in the ADI-PEG20 group vs 4 of 24 (17%) in the BSC group (P = .43), 
the most common being immune related, nonfebrile neutropenia, gastrointestinal 
events, and fatigue. Differential ASS1 gene-body methylation correlated with 
ASS1 immunohistochemistry, and longer arginine deprivation correlated with 
improved PFS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this trial, arginine deprivation with ADI-PEG20 
improved PFS in patients with ASS1-deficient mesothelioma. Targeting arginine is 
safe and warrants further clinical investigation in arginine-dependent cancers.

BACKGROUND: Physical exercise in addition to standard care (SC) in patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is now a common practice in many care units. However, 
exercises can cover a wide range of interventions, and the specific effects of 
different interventions still deserve to be further investigated.
AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 12 weeks of two 
different types of physical exercises with SC in patients suffering from PD.
DESIGN: Pseudo-randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: University laboratory for outcomes, University Hospital Centre for 
interventions.
POPULATION: Fifty-two outpatients suffering from mild to moderate PD at 
baseline.
METHODS: Participants were allocated to three groups: the strength training (ST) 
group performed individualized upper and lower limbs strength training, the 
aerobic training (AE) group performed tailored gradual aerobic cycling, and the 
third group received SC. The effects of the interventions on body function were 
assessed by measuring isokinetic concentric peak torque for knee extension and 
flexion, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and peak work load (PWL) during an 
incremental maximal cycling test. Changes in mobility were evaluated from 
spatial-temporal gait features measured by mean of an accelerometer system and 
the Six-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) Test. We used questionnaires to estimate 
health-related quality of life and habitual physical activity.
RESULTS: No significant changes in any outcome measures occurred in the SC 
group. More than 80% of the participants adequately completed the AE and the ST 
interventions. The ST group significantly improved all peak torque measures 
(P≤0.01), except knee extension in the least affected side (P=0.13). This group 
also improved the PWL (P=0.009) and 6mwd (P=0.03). The AE group improved the 
VO2peak (P=0.02) and PWL (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Physical fitness in patients with PD rapidly improved in compliance 
with training specificities, but better fitness hardly translated into better 
mobility and health-related quality of life.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Physiotherapists can efficiently propose 
physical conditioning to patients with mild to moderate PD, but these 
interventions are insufficient to improve gait and participation. 
Notwithstanding, ST is an efficient intervention for improving walking capacity.

OBJECTIVE: Immediate delivery compared with expectant management in a low risk 
population stratified by birthweight.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort of births, stillbirths and neonatal deaths from 
2010 through 2012 compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics. 
Birthweight categories were created using population derived deciles. 
Gestational age at birth was adjusted to account for time from death to 
delivery. The risk of immediate delivery was the neonatal death rate. The risk 
of expectant management was the sum of the conditional stillbirth risk plus the 
neonatal death rate for the following week. Relative risks were calculated 
comparing immediate delivery with expectant management by birthweight category.
RESULTS: There were 4 966 067 births, 6660 stillbirths and 6979 neonatal deaths. 
The gestational age at which expectant management exceeded risk of immediate 
delivery was consistently at or after 39 weeks for all except birthweights above 
the 95th centile, where the relative risk for death with immediate delivery was 
1.72 (95% CI: 1.74-1.7) at 36 and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.84-0.81) by 37 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: In this low risk cohort, risk at 39 weeks favored immediate 
delivery, except for birthweight over the 95th centile, where expectant 
management did not appear to be beneficial after 37 weeks.

BACKGROUND: The recent economic crisis has been a major shock not only to the 
economic sector, but also to the rest of society. Our main objective in this 
paper is to show the impact of the economic crisis on convergence, i.e. the 
reduction or equalising of disparities, among the EU-27 countries in terms of 
health. The aim is to observe whether the economic crisis (from 2008 onwards) 
has in fact had an effect on health inequalities within the EU.
METHODS: We estimate convergence by specifying a dynamic panel model with 
random-effects (time, regions and countries). We are particularly interested in 
σ-convergence. As dependent variables, we use life expectancy, total mortality 
and (cause-specific) mortality in the regions of the EU-27 countries over the 
period 1995-2011.
RESULTS: The results of the analysis show that, in terms of health, there has 
been a catching-up process among the EU regions. However, we find no reduction, 
on average, in dispersion levels as the σ-convergence shows. The main finding of 
this paper has been the sharp increase in disparities in 2010 for all health 
outcomes (albeit less abrupt for cancer mortality).
CONCLUSION: This increase in disparities in 2010 coincides with the austerity 
measures implemented in the EU countries. Our main conclusion is that these 
austerity measures have had an impact on socioeconomic inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Among the very elderly, poor oral health reduces life expectancy. In 
this study, differences in the magnitude of the maximum occlusal force (MOF) in 
the very elderly were examined in terms of effects on all-cause mortality in a 
3-year follow-up.
METHODS: We evaluated 489 community-living elderly individuals aged 85 years or 
older. MOF was measured using an occlusal force measuring device, and 
participants were classified into three groups according to gender- and dental 
status-sensitive tertiles. Demographic variables, cognitive, physical function, 
psychological status, oral health, comorbidity, and blood chemistry factors were 
assessed. One-way analyses of variance, χ (2) tests, and the Kruskal-Wallis test 
were used for statistical analyses. The relationship between MOF tertiles and 
3-year all-cause mortality was examined using a multivariate Cox model analysis 
after adjusting for confounding factors.
RESULTS: MOF tertiles were significantly associated with cognitive impairment, 
number of teeth, limitations on chewable foods, handgrip strength, timed 
up-and-go test, and diabetes mellitus. During the follow-up period, 74 subjects 
died. Subjects with the highest MOF had a significantly lower mortality rate 
than other groups (log rank P  =  0.031). In the univariate Cox model, MOF 
tertiles were independently associated with a lower risk of death (HR = 0.69, 
95 % CI = 0.51-0.91). Even after adjusting for various confounders in the 
multivariate Cox model (Model 1), MOF was independently associated with a lower 
risk of death (HR = 0.67, 95 % CI = 0.50-0.91). In model 2, we added handgrip 
strength as a confounder and found that the HR for MOF was attenuated 
(HR = 0.73, 95 % CI = 0.54-0.99), but still statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of the very elderly, MOF was independently associated 
with all-cause mortality after adjusting for various health issues. Moreover, 
this independent association remained after a further adjustment for handgrip 
strength; however, the HR was attenuated. This suggests that MOF and handgrip 
strength may share a common mechanism of a general decrease in muscle strength, 
possibly sarcopenia, which is a significant cause of mortality in the very old.

The aging of the population, along with rising life expectancy, means that 
increasing numbers of older men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and a 
large proportion of these men will present with metastatic disease. In this 
paper, we discuss recent advances in prostate cancer treatment. In particular, 
we review management approaches for older patients with metastatic prostate 
cancer based on the decision tree developed by the International Society of 
Geriatric Oncology, which categorized older men as "fit," "vulnerable," and 
"frail" according to comprehensive geriatric assessment.

OBJECTIVE: To review the international body of literature from 2010 to 2015 
concerning methods of economic evaluations used in hospital- and community-based 
studies of pharmacy services in publicly funded health systems worldwide, their 
clinical outcomes, and economic effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES: The literature search was undertaken between May 2, 2015, and 
September 4, 2015. Keywords included "health economics" and "evaluation" 
"assessment" or "appraisal," "methods," "hospital" or "community" or 
"residential care," "pharmacy" or "pharmacy services" and "cost minimisation 
analysis" or "cost utility analysis" or "cost effectiveness analysis" or "cost 
benefit analysis." The databases searched included MEDLINE, PubMed, Google 
Scholar, Science Direct, Springer Links, and Scopus, and journals searched 
included PLoS One, PLoS Medicine, Nature, Health Policy, Pharmacoeconomics, The 
European Journal of Health Economics, Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and 
Outcomes Research, and Journal of Health Economics.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected on the basis of study 
inclusion criteria. These criteria included full-text original research articles 
undertaking an economic evaluation of hospital- or community-based pharmacy 
services in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in English, in countries with 
a publicly funded health system published between 2010 and 2015.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 14 articles were included in this review. Cost-utility analysis 
(CUA) was the most utilized measure. Cost-minimization analysis (CMA) was not 
used by any studies. The limited use of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) is likely a 
result of technical challenges in quantifying the cost of clinical benefits, 
risks, and outcomes. Hospital pharmacy services provided clinical benefits 
including improvements in patient health outcomes and reductions in adverse 
medication use, and all studies were considered cost-effective due to meeting a 
cost-utility (per quality-adjusted life year) threshold or were cost saving. 
Community pharmacy services were considered cost-effective in 8 of 10 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations of hospital and community pharmacy services 
are becoming increasingly commonplace to enable an understanding of which health 
care services provide value for money and to inform policy makers as to which 
services will be cost-effective in light of limited health care resources.

BACKGROUND: Primary brain melanomas are very infrequent and metastasis outside 
central nervous system very uncommon. There are some cases in the literature 
about primary melanoma in the temporal lobe; nevertheless, the insular location 
has never been described.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented as left insular intraparenchymal 
hematoma with multiple bleedings. Complementary tests did not show any tumoral 
nor vascular pattern in relation with these bleedings. A complete surgical 
resection was performed, and the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, with BRAF 
mutation, was obtained after histology exam. Extension studies were negative for 
skin or mucous melanoma. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed and a metastatic lymph 
node was found. The diagnosis was primary brain melanoma with extracerebral 
metastasis. Dabrafenib 150 mg/12 h was the only chemotherapy during 5 months. 
After that, Trametinib 2 mg/24 h was added to the treatment. Eighteen months 
after surgery, the patient is independent, with stable situation, and without 
new metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Although malignant melanomas have poor prognosis, total surgical 
resection and new therapies are increasing the overall survival and improving 
quality of life. In a patient with suspected brain melanoma, in spite of having 
extracerebral metastasis, aggressive treatment may be considered.

Physalis pubescens L. (P. pubescens) is an edible plant used in folk medicine in 
China. There is traditional, but not scientific, evidence for the anti-tumour 
effects of P. pubescens. This study aimed to identify whether, or not, 
antioxidants rich in phenols and flavonoids from fruits and calyxes of P. 
pubescens can be the candidates for further development of an anti-hepatoma 
fraction, and if such biological effects coupled with reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) changes, can provide a direction for subsequent biological action. The 
effects of calyx-origin (or fruit-origin) total phenol and flavonoid (CTPF or 
FTPF) from P. pubescens on Malhavu cell viability were evaluated by using a 
counting-kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Morphological characterisation of cells was 
undertaken and the structures were photographed (200 × magnification) using 
Hoechst 3348 staining after exposure to different concentrations of CTPF or 
FTPF. Induced-apoptosis activity was determined using flow cytometry (FC) after 
Annexin VFITC/ PI staining. The corresponding ROS changes in Malhavu cells were 
observed and quantified by the uploading of 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate 
(DCFH-DA). Anti-oxidation was evaluated by a cellular oxidation-stress model and 
chemical assessments for DPPH, hydroxyl radial, super-oxide radicals, and 
reducing power. Result shows that CTPF led to significant anti-proliferation in 
a time- and dosedependent manner. However, FTPF promoted cell viability at 
100-1000 μg/mL with a dose-response manner in 24 h. With the extension of 
exposure time to 48 h, the cell viability did not increase with the growth of 
FTPF. Morphological characterisation and FC assay both demonstrated that CTPF, 
and not FTPF possessed induced-apoptotic activity. CTPF potentially induced cell 
apoptosis by promoting oxidative stress. FTPF indicated pro-oxidation at a 
concentration of 10 μg/mL and anti-oxidation capabilities at higher 
concentrations. ROS scavenging assay by oxidation-stress model indicated that 
CTPF (10 - 400 μg/mL) had ROS inhibitory capacity (R2 = 0.5156, p < 0.0001). 
FTPF (10 - 100 μg/mL) boosted the level of ROS (p < 0.0001) and inhibited the 
generation of ROS at 100-400 μg/mL (R2 = 0.5951, p < 0.0001). CTPF is a 
potential candidate requiring further exploration for the development of 
antihepatoma ingredients. The down-regulation of cell viability was related to 
production and reduction of cellular ROS.

BACKGROUND: Targeted intervention in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
closest to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) progression may offer an approach to 
treatment prioritisation whilst delivering benefits for patients and the 
healthcare system. In contrast to previous HCV economic analyses, this study 
aimed to estimate the health economic value of sustained virologic response 
(SVR) stratified by the patient's propensity to progress to ESLD.
METHODS: An HCV natural history model was adapted to estimate the value of 
avoiding ESLD complications following SVR, assessed as cost offsets and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains, as a function of time to ESLD at 
treatment initiation. These outcomes were used to estimate the financial value 
of achieving SVR, defined as the maximum investment that could be allocated 
without exceeding a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Regardless of time to ESLD onset, achieving SVR was beneficial, 
resulting in cost offsets and QALY gains, due to avoidance of ESLD 
complications. The value of achieving SVR was greatest in patients closest to 
ESLD onset, resulting in increased cost offsets and QALY gains (up to £50,901 
and 9.56 QALYs). In patients closest to ESLD onset, the financial value of 
achieving SVR was £242,051, compared with £127,116 in patients furthest from 
onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Standard cost-effectiveness evaluations may underestimate the value 
of treatment in HCV patients closest to ESLD development. Targeted intervention 
would promote efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources and reconcile 
concerns surrounding the affordability of new direct-acting antivirals, by 
minimising the number-needed-to-treat to maximise health benefit, whilst 
minimising healthcare expenditure.

BACKGROUND: In Germany the structures of generalized and specialized palliative 
care services have considerably increased over the last decade with respect to 
the number, quality and differentiation. The goal is to improve or to maintain 
the quality of life for patients with life-threatening illnesses.
AIM: The current structures of generalized and specialized palliative care 
services in Germany are presented.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The structures of healthcare services are presented 
primarily based on the S3 guidelines on palliative care for patients with 
incurable cancer. An extrapolation to all patients with incurable illnesses and 
limited life-expectancy has been carried out.
RESULTS: Palliative care in Germany can be differentiated into two sectors. 
Generalized palliative care provides care for patients with a low or moderately 
complex situation on general hospital and oncology wards, in long-term care 
facilities and in the domestic environment. Specialized palliative care services 
manage patients with a highly complex situation in palliative care units, by 
a palliative care support team in hospitals or in palliative medical day care 
centers and as outpatients in specialized outpatient palliative home care, in 
specialized palliative outpatient clinics or day care hospices. Inpatient 
hospices and the outpatient hospice services are overlapping sectors and can be 
assigned to both generalized and specialized palliative care.
CONCLUSION: Despite a good development in recent years, a nationwide and 
sufficient provision of palliative care services has still not been achieved and 
some services have hardly been developed, e. g. palliative outpatient clinics. 
Hospital palliative care support teams should soon be available in all hospitals 
caring for patients with life-threatening illnesses, due to the requirements of 
the Hospice and Palliative Care Act from 2015.

Psc-AFP, isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia L., is an antimicrobial 
protein with trypsin inhibitor activity. Its encoding gene was cloned by 3'- 
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) combined with Y-shaped adaptor-dependent 
extension (YADE) method. The gene Psc-AFP encodes a protein of 203 amino acids 
with a deduced signal peptide of 24 residues. The growth inhibition effect 
exerted by the heterologously expressed Psc-AFP in Pichia pastoris revealed that 
the recombinant Psc-AFP inhibited mycelium growth of Aspergillus niger, 
Rhizoctonia solani, and Alternaria brassicae and conidial germination of 
Alternaria alternata. The recombinant Psc-AFP also showed protease inhibitor 
activity manifested by the inhibition of trypsin. The transgenic tobacco 
bioassays confirmed that overexpressing Psc-AFP significantly enhanced the 
disease resistance of tobacco and that some of the transgenic lines were almost 
fully tolerant to Ralstonia solanacearum and A. alternata, whereas no apparent 
alteration in plant growth and development was observed. Collectively, these 
results indicate that the recombinant Psc-AFP is an active antimicrobial 
protein, with protease inhibitor activity that can be successfully produced in 
the yeast and tobacco and, therefore, maybe a potential antimicrobial candidate 
for practical use.
