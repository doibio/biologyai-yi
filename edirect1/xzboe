Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that is approved 
for the treatment of prostate cancer. GnRH antagonists bind directly to and 
block GnRH receptors, without causing the initial testosterone surge associated 
with GnRH agonists. A pivotal phase III study indicated that degarelix induced 
significantly faster reduction of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen 
level than GnRH agonist does. In addition, its 5-year extension trial suggested 
that patients could be safely switched from GnRH agonist to degarelix treatment 
with sustained efficacy, as measured by biochemical markers. Possible benefits 
of GnRH antagonists over agonists were suggested especially in patients with 
advanced prostate cancer with metastatic and symptomatic disease. Moreover, the 
recent reports including pooled data analyses on degarelix suggest improved 
disease control, quality of life, and lower urinary tract symptoms and decreased 
risk of cardiovascular diseases when compared with GnRH agonists. However, 
interpretation of these reports should be conducted cautiously because of the 
potential biases involved. This article critically reviews the results of the 
clinical trials and subsequent analyses and evaluates the points and 
counterpoints of the conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an established operation performed to 
prevent strokes, but its other potential effects, such as improving 
neurocognitive, visual, and auditory functions, remain unconfirmed. This study 
examined these effects of CEA on patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.
METHODS: This was a prospective controlled study that included 80 patients with 
minor strokes who had severe extracranial internal carotid stenoses (>70%). 
Forty patients, who did not receive or who postponed the CEA due to concerns 
about age, fear of surgery, limited life expectancy because of cancer, or 
financial problems, formed the medicine-treatment group. Another 40 patients who 
received CEA 1 week after recruitment formed the CEA group. For both groups, 
visual acuity chart tests, perimetry tests, audiometry tests, and neurologic 
scales (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Mini Mental State 
Examination, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living) were used to 
assess ophthalmic functions, auditory acuity, and neurocognitive functions 
before treatment and 3 months after treatment. Intragroup and intergroup 
comparisons were conducted to examine the effect of CEA.
RESULTS: No deaths or strokes occurred during the 3-month follow-up. The 
intragroup and intergroup comparisons of ipsilateral function showed that CEA 
could improve visual acuity, visual field, and auditory acuity at all tested 
frequencies (250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) and could improve 
the visual field and the auditory acuity for contralateral functions at 1000 Hz. 
The auditory acuity at 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz were unchanged in the intragroup 
comparison but showed no deterioration in the intergroup comparison with the 
medicine group. General neurocognitive function and independent living ability 
were significantly improved by CEA, as shown by intergroup comparisons (change 
rate of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: -8.1% ± 9.0% vs -2.7% ± 
3.0%, P < .001; change rate of Mini Mental State Examination: 15.5% ± 10.5% vs 
1.6% ± 2.6%, P < .001; change rate of Barthel Index: 28.0% ± 24.6% vs 2.0% ± 
5.5%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with minor strokes caused by severe carotid stenosis, 
CEA improves neurocognitive, ophthalmic, and acoustic functions. Studies with a 
larger sample and longer follow-up are needed to substantiate these results, and 
the underlying mechanisms need further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to reevaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal 
transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) cervical length (CL) screening in singleton 
pregnancies without prior spontaneous preterm birth.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision model to assess costs and effects of 
universal TVU CL screening at 18-23 weeks' gestation compared to routine care 
for singleton pregnancies without prior preterm birth. Based on recent data, the 
model contains the following updates: (1) reduced incidence of CL ≤20 mm at 
initial screening ultrasound (0.83%), (2) vaginal progesterone supplementation 
for women with CL ≤20 mm, (3) additional ultrasound(s) for women with CL 21-24.9 
mm, and (4) the assumption that vaginal progesterone reduces the rate of preterm 
birth <34 weeks' gestation by 39% if a short CL is diagnosed. The primary 
outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We assumed a willingness to 
pay of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Additional 
outcomes included incidence of offspring with long-term neurological deficits 
and neonatal death. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness 
of the results.
RESULTS: For every 100,000 women screened, universal TVU CL screening costs 
$9132 compared to routine care. Screening results in 215 QALYs gained and 10 
fewer neonatal deaths or neonates with long-term neurologic deficits per 100,000 
women screened. Based on the updated data, universal CL screening in low-risk 
women remains a cost-effective strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = 
$43/QALY), but is not cost saving as previously estimated. Sensitivity analyses 
reveal that when incidence of TVU CL ≤20 mm is <0.31%, universal TVU CL 
screening is no longer cost-effective. Additionally, when TVU CL costs >$314, 
progesterone reduces preterm delivery risk before 34 weeks <19%, or the 
incidence of a TVU CL 21-24.9 mm is >6.5%, CL screening is also no longer 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Despite the reduced incidence and efficacy used in this model, 
universal TVU CL continues to be cost-effective when compared to routine care in 
singletons without prior preterm birth.

Although most treatment algorithms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) begin 
with classifying patients according to disease severity, no formal validated or 
consensus definitions of mild, moderate, or severe IBD currently exist. There 
are 3 main domains relevant to the evaluation of disease severity in IBD: impact 
of the disease on the patient, disease burden, and disease course. These 
measures are not mutually exclusive and the correlations and interactions 
between them are not necessarily proportionate. A comprehensive literature 
search was performed regarding current definitions of disease severity in both 
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and the ability to categorize disease 
severity in a particular patient. Although numerous assessment tools for 
symptoms, quality of life, patient-reported outcomes, fatigue, endoscopy, 
cross-sectional imaging, and histology (in ulcerative colitis) were identified, 
few have validated thresholds for categorizing disease activity or severity. 
Moving forward, we propose a preliminary set of criteria that could be used to 
classify IBD disease severity. These are grouped by the 3 domains of disease 
severity: impact of the disease on the patient (clinical symptoms, quality of 
life, fatigue, and disability); measurable inflammatory burden (C-reactive 
protein, mucosal lesions, upper gastrointestinal involvement, and disease 
extent), and disease course (including structural damage, history/extension of 
intestinal resection, perianal disease, number of flares, and extraintestinal 
manifestations). We further suggest that a disease severity classification 
should be developed and validated by an international group to develop a 
pragmatic means of identifying patients with severe disease. This is 
increasingly important to guide current therapeutic strategies for IBD and to 
develop treatment algorithms for clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy is a key component of advanced ovarian cancer 
treatment, when surgery alone is not sufficient. Recurrence is common in ovarian 
cancer patients and most women require prolonged second-line and higher-line 
chemotherapy. With newer targeted therapies, modest improvements in survival and 
quality of life may be attained at substantial cost, but the relative economic 
efficiency of these newer agents remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We undertook this systematic review to comprehensively evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of various chemotherapeutic and targeted therapy alternatives 
for ovarian cancer.
METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, and Embase databases to identify economic 
evaluations published over the last 18 years (1996-2014). From the 2513 unique 
papers retrieved, 74 full texts were selected for full-text review based on a 
priori eligibility criteria. Two authors independently reviewed these articles 
to determine eligibility for final review. The quality of the included studies 
was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES).
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were included for reporting. Administration of 
intravenous cisplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy for first-line 
treatment was the most cost-effective alternative (2014 US dollars [USD] 
equivalent incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] ~US$17,000-US$27,000 per 
life year gained [LYG]), while the use of bevacizumab did not demonstrate 
similar value for money (2014 USD equivalent ICER was greater than US$200,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). For second-line treatment, the use of 
platinum-paclitaxel combination or platinum monotherapy was cost-effective 
compared with platinum monotherapy or best supportive care, respectively, in 
women with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. For patients with partial 
platinum sensitivity, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) plus trabectedin may 
be cost-effective (2014 USD equivalent ICER was ~US$57,000-US$62,000 per QALY) 
compared with PLD alone. For recurrent platinum-resistant cases, there was 
limited evidence to conclude the most valuable treatment; though one study 
showed that best supportive care was most cost-effective, while second-line 
monotherapy with doxorubicin (2014 USD equivalent ICER was ~US$90,000 per LYG) 
may also be cost-effective compared with best supportive care.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite varying methodological approaches and multiple sources for 
cost and effectiveness inputs, this systematic review demonstrated that standard 
platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment was most 
cost-effective. There was unanimous agreement that bevacizumab was not a 
cost-effective front-line therapy compared with platinum-taxane combination for 
the overall ovarian cancer population, though its use in the high-use population 
may yield better value. For second-line treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy 
remained cost-effective among patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive 
disease, while there was limited evidence to conclude the most valuable 
treatment alternative among patients with recurrent platinum-resistant disease. 
Future research incorporating real-world data is essential to corroborate 
findings from trial-based economic evaluations. In addition, for improving 
consistency in reporting and quality of studies, incorporating QALYs in this 
population is important, especially since chemotherapy is administered for 
lengthy periods of time.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequent disorder in children and is 
primarily associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The prominent increases in 
childhood overweight and obesity rates in the world even among youngest of 
children have translated into parallel increases in the prevalence of OSA, and 
such trends are undoubtedly associated with deleterious global health outcomes 
and life expectancy. Even an obesity phenotype in childhood OSA, more close to 
the adult type, has been recently proposed. Reciprocal interactions between 
sleep in general, OSA, obesity, and disruptions of metabolic homeostasis have 
emerged in recent years. These associations have suggested the a priori 
involvement of complex sets of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, all of which 
may underlie an increased risk for increased orexigenic behaviors and 
dysfunctional satiety, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance that ultimately 
favor the emergence of metabolic syndrome. Here, we review some of the critical 
evidence supporting the proposed associations between sleep disruption and the 
metabolism-obesity complex. In addition, we describe the more recent evidence 
linking the potential interactive roles of OSA and obesity on metabolic 
phenotype.

RATIONALE: Malignant airway obstruction is commonly found in patients with lung 
cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Relieving 
malignant obstruction may improve symptoms, quality of life, and life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyze our experience with 
bronchoscopic endobronchial intratumoral injection of cisplatin for malignant 
airway obstruction.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with malignant airway 
obstruction treated with bronchoscopic intratumoral injection of cisplatin. 
Patient characteristics, histology, degree of airway obstruction, procedural 
methods, treatment cycles, performance status, and therapeutic outcomes were 
evaluated. Tumor response was analyzed based on bronchoscopic measurements 
performed on completion the of final treatment session. Adverse events and 
overall survival were abstracted.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January 2009 and September 2014, 22 
patients (10 men, 12 women; mean age ± SD, 64.4 ± 9.5 yr) were treated with one 
to four injections of 40 mg of cisplatin mixed in 40 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Treatments 
were completed 1 week apart. The primary etiologies of airway obstruction 
included squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11), adenocarcinoma (n = 6), small cell 
carcinoma (n = 2), large cell undifferentiated carcinoma (n = 1), and metastatic 
endobronchial cancer (n = 2). Twenty-one of 22 patients were evaluable for 
response. The majority of patients (15/21, 71.4%) responded to therapy, defined 
as greater than 50% relative reduction in obstruction from baseline. Treatment 
response was obtained regardless of tumor histology, concurrent systemic 
therapy, number of treatment cycles administered, performance status, or use of 
additional ablative interventions. Responders had significantly improved overall 
survival as compared with nonresponders, although the difference was small. 
Severe treatment-related side effects or complications were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the limitations of a single-center retrospective study 
and a subjective primary outcome measure, we have demonstrated the feasibility 
of improving the patency of central airways that are largely or completely 
occluded by endobronchial malignant tumor using intraluminal injection of 
cisplatin. Additional longer-term, larger-scale safety and comparative 
effectiveness studies of this palliative treatment modality are warranted.

Lifetime prediction of coronary heart disease and heart disease of uncertain 
etiology in a 50-year follow-up population study.

OBJECTIVES: The relationships of four basic risk factors with 50-year incidence 
of coronary heart disease (CHD) and Heart Disease of Uncertain Etiology (HDUE) 
were investigated in a population study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 1712 men aged 40-59 years in 1960 and 1677, 
heart disease free, were followed-up for 50 years. Incidence of first event for 
CHD (sudden death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, other fatal and 
non-fatal coronary syndromes) and HDUE (heart failure, chronic arrhythmia, 
blocks, "chronic CHD", hypertensive heart disease) was estimated and the 
relationships of four basic risk factors analyzed.
RESULTS: In 50 years incidences of CHD and HDUE were respectively 26.9 and 
20.6%. Cox proportional hazards models showed serum cholesterol as a strong CHD 
predictor (hazard ratio, HR, for 1 mmol/l difference 1.22 and confidence 
intervals, CI, 1.11 to 1.33), irrelevant for HDUE (HR 1.02 and CI 0.87 to 1.18). 
Age at entry was a stronger predictor for HDUE (HR for 5 year difference 1.65 
and CI 1.46 to 1.86) than for CHD (HR 1.26 and CI 1.14 to 1.39). Systolic blood 
pressure and cigarette smoking had similar predictive power. The diagnosis of 
angina pectoris (AP) recorded at any time during the study was strongly 
associated with CHD but not with HDUE. A HDUE subgroup with AP had similar 
life-expectancy to CHD, suggesting the need to re-classify them as CHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to important differences in predictors (risk factors) and 
expectancy of life CHD and HDUE are probably manifestations of different 
etiologies.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with age, reaching rates 
around 30% in those over 75 years. The type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly 
has different pathophysiological and clinical characteristics from those of the 
younger diabetic patient. Some differential aspects in this population are the 
lower life expectancy and the frequent comorbidity, frailty and associated 
disability. Avoiding hypoglycemia is a therapeutic priority, given their 
increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. It is a situation in which the benefits 
of intensive glycemic control are virtually non-existent, thus prevention of 
side effects of treatments becomes a priority. Therefore, the goals of glycemic 
control should be less stringent than in the general population (glycated 
hemoglobin>7%), and the drugs of choice should be those with a low risk of side 
effects (especially hypoglycemia) and well tolerated. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
inhibitors (iDPP4) are particularly useful in this age group, either as a second 
drug added to metformin monotherapy, or as first line when metformin is 
contraindicated or not tolerated. In this article the evidence available on the 
efficacy and tolerance of different pharmacological options available in 
population over 70 years is reviewed.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a disease caused by 
mutations in the COL7A1 gene that result in absent or dysfunctional type VII 
collagen protein production. Clinically, RDEB manifests as early and severe 
chronic cutaneous blistering, damage to internal epithelium, an increased risk 
for squamous cell carcinoma, and an overall reduced life expectancy. Recent 
localized and systemic treatments have shown promise for lessening the disease 
severity in RDEB, but the concept of ex vivo therapy would allow a patient's own 
cells to be engineered to express functional type VII collagen. Here, we review 
gene delivery and editing platforms and their application toward the development 
of next-generation treatments designed to correct the causative genetic defects

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the dose-dependent effect of androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) on adverse cardiac events in elderly men with non-metastatic 
prostate cancer (PCa) stratified according to life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 384 men diagnosed with localized PCa between 
1992 and 2007 were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results registry areas. We compared those who received ADT within 2 years of PCa 
diagnosis with those who did not, calculated as monthly equivalent doses of GnRH 
agonists (<8, ≥8 doses), or orchiectomy. Men were further stratified according 
to life expectancy (<5 years, 5-10 years and >10 years). Adjusted Cox hazard 
models assessed the risk of new-onset coronary heart disease (CHD), acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), sudden cardiac death (SCD) and cardiac-related 
interventions, as well as any of these events.
RESULTS: Overall, patients receiving GnRH agonists were more likely to 
experience a cardiac event, with the most pronounced effect among those 
receiving ≥8 doses (hazard ratio [HR] <8 doses: 1.13, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.09-1.16, and HR ≥8 doses: 1.18, 95% CI 1.14-1.22; both P < 0.001). The 
effect of prolonged (≥8 doses) GnRH agonist use on cardiac events was sustained 
across all strata of life expectancy; however, there was no effect among men 
with a life expectancy of <5 years and when use of GnRH agonists was limited to 
<8 doses (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.67-1.46; P = 0.964). The use of GnRH agonists was 
associated with a higher risk of CHD (HR <8 doses: 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.17 and HR 
≥8 doses: 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.21; both P < 0.001). Conversely, the use of GnRH 
was generally not associated with an increased risk of AMI or SCD, except for 
men who received ≥8 doses of GnRH agonists and had a life expectancy of 
≥5 years, who were at a significantly higher risk of SCD (HR for life expectancy 
5-10 years: 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33; P = 0.003 and HR for life expectancy 
>10 years: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29; P = 0.006). Finally, orchiectomy was not 
associated with overall cardiac events, AMI or SCD, and was protective with 
regard to cardiac-related interventions (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Exposure to ADT with GnRH agonists is associated with an increased 
risk of cardiac events in elderly men with localized PCa and a decent life 
expectancy. Clinicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in 
patients with a prolonged life expectancy. Routine screening and lifestyle 
interventions are warranted in at-risk subpopulations treated with ADT.

Postmenopausal Motherhood Reloaded: Advanced Age and In Vitro Derived Gametes.

Cutas D, Smajdor A.

In this paper we look at the implications of an emerging technology for the case 
in favor of, or against, postmenopausal motherhood. Technologies such as in 
vitro derived gametes (sperm and eggs derived from nonreproductive cells) have 
the potential to influence the ways in which reproductive medicine is practiced, 
and are already bringing new dimensions to debates in this area. We explain what 
in vitro derived gametes are and how their development may impact on the case of 
postmenopausal motherhood. We briefly review some of the concerns that 
postmenopausal motherhood has raised-and the implications that the successful 
development, and use in reproduction, of artificial gametes might have for such 
concerns. The concerns addressed include arguments from nature, risks and 
efficacy, reduced energy of the mother, and maternal life expectancy. We also 
consider whether the use of in vitro derived gametes to facilitate 
postmenopausal motherhood would contribute to reinforcing a narrow, geneticized 
account of reproduction and a pro-reproductive culture that encourages women to 
produce genetically related offspring at all costs.

rivaroxaban compared with combined low molecular weight heparin/vitamin K 
antagonist.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a burden on healthcare systems. 
Standard treatment involves parenteral anticoagulation overlapping with a 
vitamin K antagonist, an approach that is effective but associated with 
limitations including the need for frequent coagulation monitoring. The direct 
oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is similarly effective to standard therapy as a 
single-drug treatment for VTE and does not require routine coagulation 
monitoring. The objective of this economic evaluation was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with standard VTE treatment from a UK 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using data and probabilities derived 
from the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies of rivaroxaban and other published 
sources. Health outcomes included VTE rates, bleeding events avoided, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs).
RESULTS: There was greater discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy with 
rivaroxaban than with standard therapy, irrespective of indication and treatment 
duration. Rivaroxaban was associated with per-patient cost savings for each 
treatment duration modelled (3, 6 and 12 months), and these were greatest with 
shorter durations. Rivaroxaban was found to be dominant (cheaper and more 
effective) and, therefore, cost-effective, in both patients with deep vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in all three treatment duration groups, and 
was also cost-effective in patients requiring lifelong anticoagulation (ICERs: 
£8677 per QALY and £7072 per QALY in patients with index deep vein thrombosis 
and pulmonary embolism, respectively). The cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban was 
largely insensitive to variations in one-way sensitivity analysis. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY, 
rivaroxaban had a consistent probability of being cost-effective, compared with 
LMWH/VKA treatment, of around 80% regardless of index VTE or duration of 
anticoagulation therapy (3, 6, 12 months or lifelong).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that rivaroxaban represents a cost-effective 
choice for acute treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and 
secondary prevention of VTE in the UK, compared with LMWH/VKA treatment, 
regardless of the required treatment duration.

Enduring diabetes increases the probability of developing secondary damage to 
numerous systems, and these complications represent a cause of morbidity and 
mortality. Establishing the causes of diabetes remains the key step to eradicate 
the disease, but prevention as well as finding therapies to ameliorate some of 
the major diabetic complications is an equally important step to increase life 
expectancy and quality for the millions of individuals already affected by the 
disease or who are likely to develop it before cures become routinely available. 
In this review, we will firstly summarize some of the major complications of 
diabetes, including endothelial and pancreatic islets dysfunction, retinopathy, 
and nephropathy, and then discuss the emerging roles exerted by the neuropeptide 
pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) to counteract these 
ranges of pathologies that are precipitated by the prolonged hyperglycemic 
state. Finally, we will describe the main signalling routes activated by the 
peptide and propose possible future directions to focus on developing more 
effective peptide-based therapies to treat the major complications associated 
with longstanding diabetes.

2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside (TSG) was isolated from 
Polygonum multiflorum, a plant which is traditionally used as an anti-ageing 
drug. We have analysed ageing-related effects of TSG in the model organism C. 
elegans in comparison to resveratrol. TSG exerted a high antioxidative capacity 
both in a cell-free assay and in the nematode. The antioxidative capacity was 
even higher compared to resveratrol. Presumably due to its antioxidative 
effects, treatment with TSG decreased the juglone-mediated induction of the 
antioxidative enzyme SOD-3; the induction of the GST-4 by juglone was diminished 
slightly. TSG increased the resistance of C. elegans against lethal thermal 
stress more prominently than resveratrol (50 μM TSG increased mean survival by 
22.2%). The level of the ageing pigment lipofuscin was decreased after 
incubation with the compound. TSG prolongs the mean, median, and maximum adult 
life span of C. elegans by 23.5%, 29.4%, and 7.2%, respectively, comparable to 
the effects of resveratrol. TSG-mediated extension of life span was not 
abolished in a DAF-16 loss-of-function mutant strain showing that this 
ageing-related transcription factor is not involved in the effects of TSG. Our 
data show that TSG possesses a potent antioxidative capacity, enhances the 
stress resistance, and increases the life span of the nematode C. elegans.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributed to the improvement in 
the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients. However, the emergence of 
drug-resistant mutations (DRM) is a major viral factor impacting therapeutic 
failure. Differences in DRM can occur among HIV-1 subtypes. We evaluate the 
kinetics of the selection of resistance mutations in vitro analyzing two 
chimeric clones that contain the reverse transcriptases of subtypes B or C (RTB' 
and RTC') in cells treated with increasing concentrations of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI). The mutation K65R is selected 
more quickly in RTC' than in RTB' viruses with TDF and ddI, and additional 
mutations (positions 45, 62, and 68) were selected after K65R fixation. Other 
primary mutations (M184V and Q151M) were selected with ddI treatment in 
conjunction with K65R only in RTC' viruses. Both patterns, M184V+K65R and 
Q151M+K65R, have a significant impact on NRTI resistance. Our data suggest that 
selection of TDF and ddI DRMs can occur earlier in subtype C HIV in patients 
when compared to subtype B.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Two randomized trials were initiated to define the role and 
sequence of cytoreductive nephrectomy in combination with VEGF-targeted therapy 
for metastatic renal cell cancer. While these trials will not report before the 
end of 2016, recent retrospective population-based studies published real-world 
data on incidence, treatment, prognosis and outcome that may help to better 
define the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy for this heterogeneous patient 
population in the targeted therapy era.
RECENT FINDINGS: Since the introduction of targeted agents, utilization of 
cytoreductive nephrectomy has declined. Potentially more patients are being 
treated with their primary tumours in place. Some countries also observed an 
additional decline in the incidence of primary metastatic disease. Although 
large population-based studies consistently demonstrate a survival benefit after 
cytoreductive nephrectomy, confounding factors preclude definite conclusions. 
However, patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year or at least four 
IMDS risk factors may not benefit from cytoreductive nephrectomy.
SUMMARY: Recent retrospective data suggest a more refined use of cytoreductive 
nephrectomy in the targeted therapy era. With the exception of patients in whom 
cytoreductive nephrectomy and resection of solitary or oligometastasis may 
result in cure or delay of systemic therapy, performance, prognostic models and 
life expectancy estimates help to define the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy 
in the individual patient.

Advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is associated with a high 
metastatic potential. Life expectancy for metastatic patients is poor and rarely 
exceeds more than one year without further therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can 
decrease the tumour burden while reducing the risk of death. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy has been discussed controversially. Patients with lymph 
node-positive metastases seem to benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy. In 
selected patients, metastasectomy can prolong survival. In metastastic patients, 
the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has become the new standard regimen 
due to a lower toxicity in comparison to the combination of methotrexate, 
vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC). For second-line treatment, 
vinflunine is the only approved therapeutic agent.

BACKGROUND: Subjective life expectancy is considered relevant in predicting 
mortality and future demand for health services as well as for explaining 
peoples' decisions in several life domains, such as the perceived impact of 
health behaviour changes on future health outcomes. Such expectations and in 
particular subjective expectations regarding future health-related quality of 
life remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
individuals' subjective quality adjusted life years (QALYs) expectation from age 
65 onwards in a representative sample of the Dutch generic public.
METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was administered to a sample of the adult 
population from the Netherlands. Information on subjective expectations 
regarding length and future health-related quality of life were combined into 
one single measure of subjective expected QALYs from age 65 onwards. This 
subjective QALY expectation was related to background, health and lifestyle 
variables. The implications of using different methods to construct our main 
outcome measure were addressed.
RESULTS: Mean subjective expected QALYs from age 65 onwards was 11 QALYs (range 
-9 to 40 QALYs). Individuals with unhealthier lifestyles, chronic diseases, 
severe disorders or lower age of death of next of kin reported lower QALY 
expectations. Indicators were varyingly associated with either subjective life 
expectancy or future health-related quality of life, or both.
CONCLUSION: Extending the concept of subjective life expectancy by correcting 
for expected quality of life appears to generate important additional 
information contributing to our understanding of people's perceptions regarding 
ageing and lifestyle choices.

Hospital, 600 N. Wolfe Street, Blalock 688, Baltimore, MD, 21287, USA.

BACKGROUND: We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of hepatic resection 
(HR) (strategy A) relative to surveillance plus 6 months of additional systemic 
chemotherapy (sCT) (strategy B) for patients with colorectal disappearing liver 
metastases (DLM).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using data from a systematic literature 
review. Three base cases were evaluated: (1) a 60-year-old patient with three 
lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and was diagnosed with DLM through a computed 
tomography (CT) scan; (2) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right 
hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed 
with DLM through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; and (3) a 60-year-old 
patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT 
plus hepatic artery infusion (HAI), had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed with 
DLM through a MRI scan. The outcomes evaluated were quality-adjusted life months 
(QALMs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net health benefit 
(NHB).
RESULTS: The NHB of strategy A versus strategy B was positive in base case 1 
(7.7 QALMs, ICER $34.449/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) and base case 2 (1.6 
QALMs, ICER $43,948/QALY). In contrast it was negative (-0.2 QALMs, ICER 
$72,474/QALY) for base case 3. Monte Carlo simulation showed that strategy B is 
acceptable only in old patients (>60 years) with normalized CEA and MRI-based 
diagnosis. In younger patients, strategy B may reach cost-effectiveness only 
after sCT plus HAI.
CONCLUSION: Surveillance of DLM after sCT was more beneficial and cost-effective 
among patients >60 years with multiple factors predictive of true complete 
pathological response, such as normalization of CEA, HAI therapy, BMI 
≤30 kg/m(2), and diagnosis of DLM made through MRI.

It is widely acknowledged that patients-particularly those late in life-are 
frequently exposed to the harms of medication. To minimize these harms, several 
frameworks have been developed by which prescribing can be optimized. In the 
context of diminishing life expectancy, these frameworks can be used to reduce 
medications that are no longer necessary, but appear to fall short of actual 
guidelines that incorporate a consideration of stopping medications. In this 
commentary, we present recommendations that could be incorporated into 
prescribing processes for all healthcare professionals and, ultimately, used to 
support the rationalization or deprescribing of medication in diminished life 
expectancy. We frame these recommendations in the same context as guidance for 
the initiation and discontinuation of implantable cardiac devices and argue that 
the two processes-with regards to decision-making-should be the same. We present 
our recommendations with preventive medication use in mind, and use statin
