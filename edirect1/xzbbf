Over the last six decades, comprehensive national health surveys have become 
important data-gathering mechanisms to inform countries on their health status 
and provide information for health policy and programme planning. Developing 
countries have only recently begun such surveys and Jamaica has been at the 
forefront of this effort. Jamaica's Reproductive Health Surveys and programme 
response to their findings have resulted in an almost 50% reduction infertility 
rates over three decades as well as a 40% reduction in unmet contraceptive needs 
and a 40% reduction in unplanned pregnancies over the last two decades. The 
Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Surveys have served to reinforce the major burden 
that non-communicable diseases place on the society and the extent to which 
these are driven by unhealthy lifestyles. These surveys have shown that obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia affect approximately 50%, 25%, 10% and 
10% of the adult population, respectively. These surveys have documented low 
rates of treatment and control for these chronic non-communicable diseases 
despite two major policy initiatives, the National Programme for the Promotion 
of Healthy Lifestyles and the creation of the National Health Fund which 
subsidizes healthcare provision for chronic diseases. In order to maximize the 
uptake of the findings of future surveys into effective health policy, there 
will need to be effective collaborations between academia, policy-makers, 
regional and international health agencies, non-government organizations and 
civil society. Such collaborations should take into account the social, 
political and economic issues, thus ensuring a more comprehensive approach to 
health policy and result in improvement of the nation's health status and by 
extension national development.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to compare the changing patterns of 
mortality in adults and infants during the pre-independence period 1953-1962 
with the post-independence period 1962-2006 thus providing evidence for the 
burden of disease and the impact of independence on the state of health of the 
nation.
METHODS: The study examined data from 1953-2006, collected under statutory 
regulations by the Central Statistical Office.
RESULTS: While the population doubled during the study period, the standardized 
death rate improved from 16.4 to 4.5, infant mortality also declined from 70 per 
1000 live births to 10.5 per 1000 live births. Mortality from selected 
infectious diseases also declined, however, mortality from chronic diseases 
continued to increase. Deaths associated with HIV increased during the 1990s, 
reaching a peak of 42 per 100 000 population in 2001 before declining.
CONCLUSION: Like the developed world, some developing countries have experienced 
similar transitions in the patterns of disease occurrence and thus will need to 
develop strategies to effectively cope with these new challenges.

A decision-analytic Markov model to compare the cost-utility of anterior repair 
augmented with synthetic mesh compared with non-mesh repair in women with 
surgically treated prolapse.

Gillingham, Kent, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a mesh-augmented anterior 
vaginal wall repair compared with a non-mesh fascial plication repair.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
SETTING: Data for outcomes of different surgical techniques were derived from 
systematic reviews and recent publications.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model, developed in TreeAge Pro 2007(®) , 
was used to compare the cost-utility of mesh and non-mesh anterior vaginal wall 
repairs. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of different 
scenarios and assumptions on results from the model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Health outcomes were expressed in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Under base case assumptions at 5 years, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for mesh-augmented anterior repairs was £15 
million per QALY. Sensitivity analysis found no plausible model inputs that 
could make a mesh repair cost-effective by conventional criteria. This was 
mostly because of the extra costs associated with the price of the mesh, 
treating mesh erosion and difficulty finding data that support a lower 
reoperation rate for mesh anterior wall repairs.
CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that the use of mesh is not cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Deferasirox (DFX) is a novel iron chelator that has been shown to 
have similar efficacy and safety compared with deferoxamine (DFO) in patients 
with β-thalassemia. The aim of this study was to determine the cost utility of 
DFX versus DFO in β-thalassemia major patients from Iran's society perspective.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model has been developed to determine 
lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients. To estimate 
the annual cost of each method, a cross-sectional study was conducted among two 
groups of patients who received DFO and DFX (n = 100 and n = 45, respectively). 
Also a time trade-off method was used to estimate the utility of two strategies. 
Finally a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
examine the strength of the results.
RESULTS: Our base-case analysis showed that estimated total lifetime costs per 
patient for DFX and DFO were 47,029 international dollar ($Int) and $Int143,522, 
respectively, while the estimated total discounted QALYs per person were 12.28 
and 7.76, respectively. Calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed 
that DSX is a dominant therapy and its estimated lifetime net monetary benefit 
was $Int273,528.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the use of DFX instead of DFO represents a 
cost-effective use of resources for treatment of iron overload in patients with 
β-thalassemia from Iran's society perspective.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical effectiveness of a stepped care approach 
over a 12-month period after an acute whiplash injury; to estimate the costs and 
cost-effectiveness of each strategy including treatments and subsequent 
health-care costs; and to gain participants' perspective on experiencing 
whiplash injury, NHS treatment, and recovery within the context of the Managing 
Injuries of the Neck Trial (MINT).
DESIGN: Two linked, pragmatic, randomised controlled trials. In Step 1, 
emergency departments (EDs) were cluster randomised to usual care advice (UCA) 
or The Whiplash Book advice (WBA)/active management advice. In Step 2, 
participants were individually randomised to either a single session of advice 
from a physiotherapist or a physiotherapy package of up to six sessions. An 
economic evaluation and qualitative study were run in parallel with the trial.
SETTING: Twelve NHS trusts in England comprising 15 EDs.
PARTICIPANTS: People who attended EDs with an acute whiplash injury of 
whiplash-associated disorder grades I-III were eligible for Step 1. People who 
had attended EDs with whiplash injuries and had persistent symptoms 3 weeks 
after ED attendance were eligible for Step 2.
INTERVENTIONS: In Step 1, the control intervention was UCA and the experimental 
intervention was a psycho-educational intervention (WBA/active management 
advice). In Step 2 the control treatment was reinforcement of the advice 
provided in Step 1 and the experimental intervention was a package of up to six 
physiotherapy treatments.
MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome was the Neck Disability Index (NDI), which 
measures severity and frequency of pain and symptoms, and a range of activities 
including self-care, driving, reading, sleeping and recreation. Secondary 
outcomes included the mental and physical health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) 
subscales of the Short Form questionnaire-12 items (SF-12) and the number of 
work days lost.
RESULTS: A total of 3851 patients were recruited to Step 1 of the trial. 1598 
patients attending EDs were randomised to UCA, and 2253 were randomised to 
WBA/active management. Outcome data were obtained at 12 months for 70% and 80% 
of participants at Step 1 and Step 2, respectively. The majority of people 
recovered from the injury. Eighteen per cent of the Step 1 cohort had late 
whiplash syndrome. There was no statistically or clinically significant 
difference observed in any of the outcomes for participants attending EDs 
randomised to UCA or active management advice [difference in NDI 0.5, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -1.8 to 2.8]. In Step 2 the physiotherapy package 
resulted in improvements in neck disability at 4 months compared with a single 
advice session, but these effects were small at the population level (difference 
in NDI -3.2, 95% CI -5.8 to -0.7). The physiotherapy package was accompanied by 
a significant reduction in the number of work days lost at 4-month follow-up 
(difference -40.2, 95% CI -44.3 to -35.8).
CONCLUSIONS: MINT suggests that enhanced psycho-educational interventions in EDs 
are no more effective than UCA in reducing the burden of acute whiplash 
injuries. A physiotherapy package provided to people who have persisting 
symptoms within the first 6 weeks of injury produced additional short-term 
benefits in neck disability compared with a single physiotherapy advice session. 
However, from a health-care perspective, the physiotherapy package was not 
cost-effective at current levels of willingness to pay. Both experimental 
treatments were associated with increased cost with no discernible gain in 
health-related quality of life. However, an important benefit of the 
physiotherapy package was a reduction in work days lost; consequently, the 
intervention may prove cost-effective at the societal level.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Olympic medallists live longer than the general 
population.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, with passive follow-up and conditional 
survival analysis to account for unidentified loss to follow-up.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 15,174 Olympic athletes from nine country groups 
(United States, Germany, Nordic countries, Russia, United Kingdom, France, 
Italy, Canada, and Australia and New Zealand) who won medals in the Olympic 
Games held in 1896-2010. Medallists were compared with matched cohorts in the 
general population (by country, age, sex, and year of birth).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative conditional survival.
RESULTS: More medallists than matched controls in the general population were 
alive 30 years after winning (relative conditional survival 1.08, 95% confidence 
interval 1.07 to 1.10). Medallists lived an average of 2.8 years longer than 
controls. Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant 
survival advantage compared with controls. Gold, silver, and bronze medallists 
each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages. Medallists in endurance sports 
and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years 
(1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports 
(1.05, 1.01 to 1.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, 
irrespective of country, medal, or sport. This study was not designed to explain 
this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical 
activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with 
international sporting glory.

The STAR trial protocol: a randomised multi-stage phase II/III study of 
Sunitinib comparing temporary cessation with allowing continuation, at the time 
of maximal radiological response, in the first-line treatment of locally 
advanced/metastatic renal cancer.

Radiology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.

BACKGROUND: Over recent years a number of novel therapies have shown promise in 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Internationally the standard of care of 
first-line therapy is sunitinib™, after a clear survival benefit was 
demonstrated over interferon-α. Convention dictates that sunitinib is continued 
until evidence of disease progression, assuming tolerability, although there is 
no evidence that this approach is superior to intermittent periods of treatment. 
The purpose of the STAR trial is to compare the standard treatment strategy 
(conventional continuation strategy, CCS) with a novel drug free interval 
strategy (DFIS) which includes planned treatment breaks.
METHODS/DESIGN: The STAR trial is an NIHR HTA-funded UK pragmatic randomised 
phase II/III clinical trial in the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. 
Participants will be randomised (1:1) to either a sunitinib CCS or a DFIS. The 
overall aim of the trial is to determine whether a DFIS is non-inferior, in 
terms of 2-year overall survival (OS) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) 
(averaged over treatment and follow up), compared to a CCS. The QALY primary 
endpoint was selected to assess whether any detriment in terms of OS could be 
balanced with improvements in quality of life (QoL). This is a complex trial 
with a number of design challenges, and to address these issues a feasibility 
stage is incorporated into the trial design. Predetermined recruitment (stage A) 
and efficacy (stage B) intermediary endpoints must be met to allow continuation 
to the overall phase III trial (stage C). An integral qualitative patient 
preference and understanding study will occur alongside the feasibility stage to 
investigate patients' feelings regarding participation or non-participation in 
the trial.
DISCUSSION: The optimal duration of continuing sunitinib in advanced RCC is 
unknown. Novel targeted therapies do not always have the same constraints to 
treatment duration as standard chemotherapeutic agents and currently there are 
no randomised data comparing different treatment durations. Incorporating 
planned treatment breaks has the potential to improve QoL and cost 
effectiveness, hopefully without significant detriment on OS, as has been 
demonstrated in other cancer types with other treatments.

The BubR1 gene encodes for a mitotic regulator that ensures accurate segregation 
of chromosomes through its role in the mitotic checkpoint and the establishment 
of proper microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Germline mutations that reduce 
BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidy, shorten lifespan and induce premature ageing 
phenotypes and cancer in both humans and mice. A reduced BubR1 expression level 
is also a feature of chronological ageing, but whether this age-related decline 
has biological consequences is unknown. Using a transgenic approach in mice, we 
show that sustained high-level expression of BubR1 preserves genomic integrity 
and reduces tumorigenesis, even in the presence of genetic alterations that 
strongly promote aneuplodization and cancer, such as oncogenic Ras. We find that 
BubR1 overabundance exerts its protective effect by correcting mitotic 
checkpoint impairment and microtubule-kinetochore attachment defects. 
Furthermore, sustained high-level expression of BubR1 extends lifespan and 
delays age-related deterioration and aneuploidy in several tissues. 
Collectively, these data uncover a generalized function for BubR1 in 
counteracting defects that cause whole-chromosome instability and suggest that 
modulating BubR1 provides a unique opportunity to extend healthy lifespan.

Biological aging means a time-dependent accumulation of changes to which a 
living organism is being exposed during its lifetime. Biological aging normally 
concurs with chronological aging the time frame of which is set by an upper 
limit, the lifespan (in humans approximately 120 years). New findings in 
experimental biogerontology are challenging both the dogma of irreversibility of 
biological aging and the preset species-specific limitations of life. The 
present overview first explains the general principle of rejuvenation and 
reversal of biological aging with paradigms from stem cell research. Secondly, 
recent key publications on artificial telomerase elongation and (alleged) 
lifespan enhancement by sirtuins and resveratrol will be discussed with an 
emphasis on the implications for (future) geriatric medicine.

Cost-effectiveness analysis, prevention of atopic dermatitis by oral application 
of bacterial lysate in newborns/small children.

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
compared to placebo of prophylactic treatment with sterile bacterial lysate 
(Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) (verum) of newborns/small children 
with heredity for atopy [atopic dermatitis (AD)]. Infants were followed from the 
age of 5 weeks until 3 years of age. During this time, the number of children 
with AD who were treated with verum or placebo was observed at eight visits. 
Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed at different time points.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial performed 
in Germany included 606 newborns. After randomization, n = 303 patients were 
classified in the placebo group and n = 303 in the verum group. A total of 119 
participants left the study, so data from n = 250 patients of the placebo group 
and n = 237 patients of the verum group were available for analysis. At the 
beginning of the study, newborns were treated prophylactically with bacterial 
lysate or placebo for 26 weeks. After this, children were observed until the age 
of 3 years. A systematic literature research was done to evaluate treatment 
costs of atopic eczema in newborn/small children. Finally, 17 publications were 
included and checked for searched treatment costs of AD. A study was then 
initiated to evaluate the direct costs to statutory health insurance. Based on 
the described clinical trial, a decision tree model was developed. Using the 
evaluated direct costs and prevalence according to the clinical trial, the 
developed model can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses.
RESULTS: The focus of the analyses was on the subgroup "single heredity for 
atopy" in clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an advantage for 
bacterial lysate after 3 years. To further support this result a model extension 
was executed; the model was expanded from 3 to 6 years. Cost-effectiveness of 
bacterial lysate was also proven after 6 years.
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with bacterial lysate of infants with single 
heredity for atopy for 26 weeks in the 1st year of life is cost-effective at the 
age of 3 and 6 years, i.e. prophylactic use of bacterial lysate generated lower 
costs by leading to lower prevalence compared to placebo.

The elderly population has experienced increased life expectancy as well as the 
increased incidence of gastric ulcers. The peels of fruits from Citrus aurantium 
L., popularly known in Brazil as orange bitter, are commonly used asatea form 
for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders, such as ulcer and 
gastritis. We evaluated the healing effects of essential oil from the peels of 
Citrus aurantium fruits (OEC) on gastric ulcers in middle-aged rats. We examined 
the effects of a 14-day chronic OEC treatment on gastric mucosa in middle-aged 
male Wistar rats that were given acetic-acid-induced gastric lesions by 
morphometric and immunohistological analyses. Oral OEC treatment significantly 
reduced the lesion area (76%) within the gastric mucosa and significantly 
increased (P < .05) the height of regenerated mucosa (59%) when compared to the 
negative control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the molecular markers 
such as COX-2, HSP-70, VEGF, and PCNA in the gastric mucosa confirmed that OEC 
treatment induced healing effects by increasing the number of new blood vessels 
and by augmenting gastric mucus in the mucosa glands. These results suggest that 
the oil from Citrus aurantium effectively heals gastric ulcers in middle-aged 
animals; however, safe use of OEC demands special care and precautions.

Sciences. mohsenbarouni@yahoo.com

Economic decision models are being increasingly used to assess medical 
interventions. Advances in this field are mainly due to enhanced processing 
capacity of computers, availability of specific software to perform the 
necessary tasks, and refined mathematical techniques. We here estimated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of ten strategies for colon cancer screening, as 
well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on 
the costs and profit of chemotherapy in Iran. We used a Markov model to measure 
the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of a 50-year-old average-risk 
Iranian without screening and with screening by each test. In this paper, we 
tested the model with data from the Ministry of Health and published literature. 
We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, 
with inflation to 2011, the Iranian Rial being converted into US dollars. We 
focused on three tests for the 10 strategies considered currently being used for 
population screening in some Iranians provinces (Kerman, Golestan Mazandaran, 
Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed 
annually; fecal immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, 
performed every 10 years. These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal 
cancer by 39%, 60% and 76%, and mortality by 50%, 69% and 78%, respectively, 
compared with no screening. These approaches generated ICER (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios) of $9067, $654 and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted 
life year), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the 
influence of various scales on the economic evaluation of screening. The results 
were sensitive to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every ten 
years yielded the greatest net health value. Screening for colon cancer is 
economical and cost-effective over conventional levels of WTP8.

Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction have been shown to extend life 
expectancy and reduce inflammation and cancer promotion in animal models. It was 
hypothesized that intermittent prolonged fasting practiced during the month of 
Ramadan (RIF) could positively affect the inflammatory state. To investigate 
this hypothesis, a cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the impact 
of RIF on selected inflammatory cytokines and immune biomarkers in healthy 
subjects. Fifty (21 men and 29 women) healthy volunteers who practiced Ramadan 
fasting were recruited for the investigation of circulating proinflammatory 
cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α), immune cells 
(total leukocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes), and anthropometric 
and dietary assessments. The investigations were conducted 1 week before Ramadan 
fasting, at the end of the third week of Ramadan, and 1 month after the 
cessation of Ramadan month. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor 
necrosis factor α; systolic and diastolic blood pressures; body weight; and body 
fat percentage were significantly lower (P < .05) during Ramadan as compared 
with before Ramadan or after the cessation of Ramadan fasting. Immune cells 
significantly decreased during Ramadan but still remained within the reference 
ranges. These results indicate that RIF attenuates inflammatory status of the 
body by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression and decreasing body fat 
and circulating levels of leukocytes.

The use of qualitative methods in developing the descriptive systems of 
preference-based measures of health-related quality of life for use in economic 
evaluation.

OBJECTIVES: To describe how qualitative methods can be used in the development 
of descriptive systems of preference-based measures (PBMs) of health-related 
quality of life.
METHODS: The requirements of the National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence and other agencies together with the increasing use of 
patient-reported outcome measures has led to an increase in the demand for PBMs. 
Recently, interest has grown in developing new PBMs and while previous research 
on PBMs has mainly focused on the methods of valuation, research into the 
methods of developing descriptive systems is an emerging field.
RESULTS: Traditionally, descriptive systems of PBMs were developed by using 
top-down methods, where content was derived from existing measures, the 
literature, or health surveys. A contrasting approach is a bottom-up 
methodology, which takes the views of patients or laypeople on how their life is 
affected by their health. This approach generally requires the use of 
qualitative methods. Qualitative methods lend themselves well to the development 
of PBMs. They also ensure that the measure has appropriate language, content 
validity, and responsiveness to change. While the use of qualitative methods in 
the development of non-PBMs is fairly standard, their use in developing PBMs was 
until recently nonexistent.
CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we illustrate the use of qualitative methods by 
presenting two case studies of recently developed PBMs, one generic and one 
condition specific. We outline the stages involved, discuss the strengths and 
weaknesses of the approach, and compare with the top-down approach used in the 
majority of PBMs to date.

OBJECTIVE: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a safe and inexpensive 
diagnostic procedure for evaluating thyroid nodules.Up to 25% of the results 
from an FNAB, however, may not be diagnostic or may be indeterminate, leading to 
a subsequent diagnostic thyroid surgery. A new molecularly based diagnostic test 
could potentially reduce indeterminate cytological results and, with high 
accuracy, provide a definitive diagnosis for cancer in thyroid nodules. The aim 
of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of utilizing a molecular 
diagnostic (DX) test as an adjunct to FNAB, compared with NoDX, to improve the 
preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules.
METHODS: We constructed a patient-level simulation model to estimate the 
clinical and economic outcomes of using a DX test compared with current practice 
(NoDX) for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. By using a cost-effectiveness 
framework, we measured incremental clinical benefits in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years and incremental costs over a 10-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Assuming 95% sensitivity and specificity of the Dx test when used as an 
adjunct to FNAB, the utilization of the DX test resulted in a gain of 0.046 
quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval 0.019-0.078) and a saving 
of $1087 (95% confidence interval $691-$1533) in direct costs per patient. If 
the cost of the Dx test is less than $1087 per test, we expect to save 
quality-adjusted life-years and reduce costs when it is utilized. Sensitivity of 
the DX test, compared with specificity, had a larger influence on the overall 
outcomes.

A multigene prognostic assay for selection of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients 
with T3, stage II colon cancer: impact on quality-adjusted life expectancy and 
costs.

OBJECTIVES: Uncertainty exists regarding appropriate and affordable use of 
adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch 
repair). This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness and costs from a US 
societal perspective of a multigene recurrence score (RS) assay for patients 
recently diagnosed with stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch 
repair) eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: RS was compared with guideline-recommended clinicopathological factors 
(tumor stage, lymph nodes examined, tumor grade, and lymphovascular invasion) by 
using a state-transition (Markov) lifetime model. Data were obtained from 
published literature, a randomized controlled trial (QUick And Simple And 
Reliable) of adjuvant chemotherapy, and rates of chemotherapy use from the 
National Cooperative Cancer Network Colon/Rectum Cancer Outcomes study. 
Life-years, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs were examined.
RESULTS: The RS is projected to reduce adjuvant chemotherapy use by 17% compared 
with current treatment patterns and to increase quality-adjusted life expectancy 
by an average of 0.035 years. Direct medical costs are expected to decrease by 
an average of $2971 per patient. The assay was cost saving for all subgroups of 
patients stratified by clinicopathologic factors. The most influential variables 
affecting treatment decisions were projected years of life remaining, recurrence 
score, and patients' disutilities associated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the multigene RS to assess recurrence risk after surgery in 
stage II colon cancer (T3, proficient DNA mismatch repair) may reduce the use of 
adjuvant chemotherapy without decreasing quality-adjusted life expectancy and be 
cost saving from a societal perspective. These findings need to be validated in 
additional cohorts, including studies of clinical practice as assay use diffuses 
into nonacademic settings.

Using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale to estimate health state utility 
values: mapping from the MSIS-29, version 2, to the EQ-5D and the SF-6D.

OBJECTIVES: The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a 
psychometrically validated patient-reported outcome measure increasingly used in 
trials of treatments for multiple sclerosis. However, it is non-preference-based 
and not amenable for use across policy decision-making contexts. Our objective 
was to statistically map from the MSIS-29, version 2, to the EuroQol 
five-dimension (EQ-5D) and the six-dimension health state short form (derived 
from short form 36 health survey) (SF-6D) to estimate algorithms for use in 
cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: The relationships between MSIS-29, version 2, and EQ-5D and SF-6D 
scores were estimated by using data from a cohort of people with multiple 
sclerosis in South West England (n=672). Six ordinary least squares (OLS), 
Tobit, and censored least adjusted deviation (CLAD) regression analyses were 
conducted on estimation samples, including the use of subscale and item scores, 
squared and interaction terms, and demographics. Algorithms from models with the 
smallest estimation errors (mean absolute error [MAE], root mean square error 
[RMSE], normalized RMSE) were then assessed by using separate validation 
samples.
RESULTS: Tobit and CLAD. For the EQ-5D, the OLS models including subscale 
squared terms, and item scores and demographics performed comparably (MAE 0.147, 
RMSE 0.202 and MAE 0.147, RMSE 0.203, respectively), and estimated scores well 
up to 3 years post-baseline. Estimation errors for the SF-6D were smaller (OLS 
model including squared terms: MAE 0.058, RMSE 0.073; OLS model using item 
scores and demographics: MAE 0.059, RMSE 0.08), and the errors for poorer health 
states found with the EQ-5D were less pronounced.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided algorithms for the estimation of health state 
utility values, both the EQ-5D and SF-6D, from scores on the MSIS-29, version 2. 
Further research is now needed to determine how these algorithms perform in 
practical decision-making contexts, when compared with observed EQ-5D and SF-6D 
values.

BACKGROUND: A commonly held view of the decision rule in economic evaluations in 
health care is that the final incremental cost-effectiveness ratio needs to be 
judged against some threshold, which is equal for all quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gains. This reflects the assumption that "a QALY is a QALY" no matter who 
receives it, or the equity notion that all QALY gains are equally valuable, 
regardless of the context in which they are realized. If such an assumption does 
not adequately reflect the distributional concerns in society, however, 
different thresholds could be used for different QALY gains, whose relative 
values can be seen as "equity weights."
AIM: Our aim was to explore the relationship between equity or distributional 
concerns and the social value of QALYs within the health economics literature. 
In light of the empirical interest in equity-related concerns as well as the 
nature and height of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold, this 
study investigates the "common ground" between the two streams of literature and 
considers how the empirical literature estimating the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio threshold treats existing distributional 
considerations.

What is wrong with orphan drug policies? Suggestions for ways forward.

Kanavos P(1), Nicod E.

London, UK. p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk

We argue that orphan drug policies have been useful in incentivizing socially 
desirable R&D and that in their absence it is unlikely that treatments of any 
kind would have emerged. Weaknesses in the current policy framework need to be 
addressed by refining this framework rather than altogether replacing or 
dismissing it as inefficient. Improvements can be made in data collection, and 
efforts are already under way at the European Union level with initiatives 
concerning registries. Similarly, the legislative framework can be refined to 
define when an orphan treatment is "sufficiently profitable," at what stage 
should profits be considered excessive, and, consequently, whether any favorable 
conditions offered to manufacturers should be removed. Concerns about 
availability and accessibility of orphan drugs, which are valid in many 
instances, do not imply that the current orphan drug policy framework is 
deficient but that the means of assessment need to be improved upon for 
realistic and affordable prices for payers to become the norm. This implies 
better data quality, the possible extension of the criteria for value assessment 
to take explicitly into account the peculiarities of rare diseases, and the 
availability of appropriate benchmarks around rare disease cost and quality of 
life to conduct meaningful value assessments.

Equity and women's health services for contraception, abortion and childbirth in 
Brazil.

Public Health, São Paulo, Brazil. sidiniz@usp.br

This paper addresses equity in health and health care in Brazil, examining 
unjust disparities between women and men, and between women from different 
social strata, with a focus on services for contraception, abortion and 
pregnancy. In 2010 women's life expectancy was 77.6 years, men's was 69.7 years. 
Women are two-thirds of public hospital services users and assess their health 
status less positively than men. The total fertility rate was 1.8 in 2011, and 
contraceptive prevalence has been high among women at all income levels. The 
proportion of sterilizations has decreased; lower-income women are more 
frequently sterilized. Abortions are mostly illegal; women with more money have 
better access to safe abortions in private clinics. Poorer women generally 
self-induce abortion with misoprostol, seeking treatment of complications from 
public clinics. Institutional violence on the part of health professionals is 
reported by half of women receiving abortion care and a quarter of women during 
childbirth. Maternity care is virtually universal. The public sector has fewer 
caesarean sections, fewer low birthweight babies, and more rooming-in, but 
excessive episiotomies and inductions. Privacy, continuity of care and 
companionship during birth are more common in the private sector. To achieve 
equity, the health system must go beyond universal, unregulated access to 
technology, and move towards safe, effective and transparent care.

Epigenetics and aging.

Over the past two decades, a growing interest on the research of the biological 
basis of human longevity has emerged, in order to clarify the intricacy of 
biological and environmental factors affecting (together with stochastic 
factors) the quality and the rate of human aging. These researches have outlined 
a complex scenario in which epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and 
numerous histone modifications, are emerging as important factors of the overall 
variation in life expectancy. In fact, epigenetic marks, that are responsible of 
the establishment of specific expression programs and of genome stability, 
represent a "drawbridge" across genetic, environmental and stochastic factors. 
In this review we provide an overview on the current knowledge and the general 
features of the epigenetic modifications characterizing the aging process.

BACKGROUND: Estimation of the number and rate of deaths by age and sex is a key 
first stage for calculation of the burden of disease in order to constrain 
estimates of cause-specific mortality and to measure premature mortality in 
populations. We aimed to estimate life tables and annual numbers of deaths for 
187 countries from 1970 to 2010.
METHODS: We estimated trends in under-5 mortality rate (children aged 0-4 years) 
and probability of adult death (15-59 years) for each country with all available 
data. Death registration data were available for more than 100 countries and we 
corrected for undercount with improved death distribution methods. We applied 
refined methods to survey data on sibling survival that correct for survivor, 
zero-sibling, and recall bias. We separately estimated mortality from natural 
disasters and wars. We generated final estimates of under-5 mortality and adult 
mortality from the data with Gaussian process regression. We used these results 
as input parameters in a relational model life table system. We developed a 
model to extrapolate mortality to 110 years of age. All death rates and numbers 
have been estimated with 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs).
FINDINGS: From 1970 to 2010, global male life expectancy at birth increased from 
56·4 years (95% UI 55·5-57·2) to 67·5 years (66·9-68·1) and global female life 
expectancy at birth increased from 61·2 years (60·2-62·0) to 73·3 years 
(72·8-73·8). Life expectancy at birth rose by 3-4 years every decade from 1970, 
apart from during the 1990s (increase in male life expectancy of 1·4 years and 
in female life expectancy of 1·6 years). Substantial reductions in mortality 
occurred in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa since 2004, coinciding with 
increased coverage of antiretroviral therapy and preventive measures against 
malaria. Sex-specific changes in life expectancy from 1970 to 2010 ranged from 
gains of 23-29 years in the Maldives and Bhutan to declines of 1-7 years in 
Belarus, Lesotho, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe. Globally, 52·8 million (95% UI 
51·6-54·1 million) deaths occurred in 2010, which is about 13·5% more than 
occurred in 1990 (46·5 million [45·7-47·4 million]), and 21·9% more than 
occurred in 1970 (43·3 million [42·2-44·6 million]). Proportionally more deaths 
in 2010 occurred at age 70 years and older (42·8% in 2010 vs 33·1% in 1990), and 
22·9% occurred at 80 years or older. Deaths in children younger than 5 years 
declined by almost 60% since 1970 (16·4 million [16·1-16·7 million] in 1970 vs 
6·8 million [6·6-7·1 million] in 2010), especially at ages 1-59 months (10·8
