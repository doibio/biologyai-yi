BACKGROUND: Hunan Province is a region in China with a high prevalence of 
intracerebral hemorrhage, especially primary intracerebral hemorrhage (PICH). 
The objective of this observational study was to assess the disease burden of 
PICH.
METHODS: We searched the Hunan Provincial Health Statistics Direct Reporting and 
Decision Analysis System to retrieve PICH inpatient and outpatient data and 
all-population all-cause deaths in Hunan Province in 2018. DisMod II was used to 
estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to PICH in 2018.
RESULTS: In 2018, 30,400 new PICH cases were recorded in Hunan Province. The 
incidence was higher among men (51.6 per 100,000) than women (29.3 per 100,000). 
The DALYs due to PICH were 478,000 patient-years, the years of life lost (YLLs) 
were 452,000 patient-years and the years lived with disability (YLDs) were 
27,000 patient-years. In 2018, the rate of DALYs due to PICH was 6.4 
patient-years per 1000 individuals, the rate of YLLs was 6.1 patient-years per 
1000 individuals, and the rate of YLDs was 0.3 patient-years per 1000 
individuals.
CONCLUSION: We estimated the DALYs due to PICH in Hunan Province in 2018, 
thereby providing relevant data for the development of policies and measures for 
the management of PICH disease burden.

Determining the relationship between the entire brain structure and individual 
differences is important in extending healthy life expectancy, which can be 
affected by brain atrophy. The entire brain structure has been gradually known 
to be correlated not only with age but also with individual differences, such as 
quality of life, general intelligence, and lifestyle. However, little attention 
has been paid to the relationship between the entire brain structure and 
personal traits. We herein focused on one personal trait, namely spiritual 
growth, and examined its relationship with the entire brain structure using two 
neuroimaging-derived measures, namely the gray matter Brain Healthcare Quotient 
(GM-BHQ), a measure of GM volume, and the fractional anisotropy Brain Healthcare 
Quotient (FA-BHQ), a measure of white matter (WM) integrity, in 229 healthy 
participants (53 female, 176 male). The results indicated no significant 
relationship between the GM-BHQ and spiritual growth, but there was a 
significant positive correlation between the FA-BHQ and spiritual growth after 
controlling for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) with partial correlation 
analysis. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed a significant 
positive correlation between the FA-BHQ and spiritual growth after controlling 
for physical characteristics, such as age, sex, and BMI, as well as other 
variables related to lifestyle that were collected using the Health-Promoting 
Lifestyle Profile. These results support the idea that there is a relationship 
between the entire WM brain structure and spiritual growth. Further studies are 
required to clarify the causal relationship between the entire WM brain 
structure and spiritual growth with some interventions to improve spiritual 
growth. Such studies will help extend healthy life expectancy from a new 
perspective of personal trait.

To prolong the shelf life of perishable food with a simple and environmentally 
friendly postharvest preservation technology is one of the global concerns. This 
study aimed to explore the application value of biological macromolecule natural 
cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) in extending the postharvest fruit shelf life. In 
this study, 0.5% (wt%) CNFs were prepared from natural wood and coated on the 
surface of early-ripening apple fruits. After 10 days of storage at room 
temperature, the results revealed that the shelf life of apple fruits with CNF 
coating was significantly prolonged, and the fruit appearance quality improved. 
The invisible network structure of CNFs in the fruit epidermis was observed 
under an atomic force microscope (AFM). The gas chromatography and mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that CNFs significantly promoted the 
formation of epidermal wax, especially fatty alcohols, during storage. In 
addition, the CNFs remarkably promoted the upregulation of genes related to the 
synthesis of cuticular wax of apple. In conclusion, this study provides an 
environmentally sustainable nanomaterial for post-harvest preservation of 
horticultural products, and also provides a new insight into the effect of CNFs 
on postharvest storage of apple fruits.

The Challenging Pathway of Treatment for Neurogenesis Impairment in Down 
Syndrome: Achievements and Perspectives.

Down syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by 
triplication of Chromosome 21. Gene triplication may compromise different body 
functions but invariably impairs intellectual abilities starting from infancy. 
Moreover, after the fourth decade of life people with DS are likely to develop 
Alzheimer's disease. Neurogenesis impairment during fetal life stages and 
dendritic pathology emerging in early infancy are thought to be key determinants 
of alterations in brain functioning in DS. Although the progressive improvement 
in medical care has led to a notable increase in life expectancy for people with 
DS, there are currently no treatments for intellectual disability. Increasing 
evidence in mouse models of DS reveals that pharmacological interventions in the 
embryonic and neonatal periods may greatly benefit brain development and 
cognitive performance. The most striking results have been obtained with 
pharmacotherapies during embryonic life stages, indicating that it is possible 
to pharmacologically rescue the severe neurodevelopmental defects linked to the 
trisomic condition. These findings provide hope that similar benefits may be 
possible for people with DS. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding 
(i) the scope and timeline of neurogenesis (and dendritic) alterations in DS, in 
order to delineate suitable windows for treatment; (ii) the role of triplicated 
genes that are most likely to be the key determinants of these alterations, in 
order to highlight possible therapeutic targets; and (iii) prenatal and neonatal 
treatments that have proved to be effective in mouse models, in order to 
rationalize the choice of treatment for human application. Based on this body of 
evidence we will discuss prospects and challenges for fetal therapy in 
individuals with DS as a potential means of drastically counteracting the 
deleterious effects of gene triplication.

Effect of COVID-19 Epidemic on Life Expectancy and Years of Life Lost in Iran: A 
Secondary Data Analysis.

(1)National Institute of Population Research, Tehran, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant number of deaths in 
many countries around the world. This study provides an estimate of the effect 
of the COVID-19 epidemic on life expectancy and years of life lost (YLL) in 
Iran.
METHODS: This study is a secondary data analysis carried out in 2020. Mortality 
data from COVID-19 were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical 
Education. Since the calculation of mortality rates requires the number of 
people at risk of death, this data was obtained from the Statistics Center of 
Iran and was used after a detailed evaluation. The effect of COVID-19 on 
mortality is evaluated using the techniques of a multi-decrement life table and 
the corresponding single-reduction life table. The YLL is calculated using the 
standard method provided by the World Health Organization.
RESULTS: Analysis of mortality data showed that deaths due to COVID-19 could 
reduce life expectancy at birth by 1.4 years in 2020. Therefore, life expectancy 
at birth declined from 75.1 years to 73.7 years. Furthermore, the deaths due to 
COVID-19 from the outbreak to early February 2021 have caused about 800,000 
years of YLL, which is almost as much as the YLL caused by cancers and tumors.
CONCLUSION: A decrease in life expectancy at birth by more than one year in 
countries with a life expectancy of over 70 years, such as Iran, can delay the 
increase in life expectancy for several years.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease, with an extremely 
high risk of death when ruptured. With the increase in life expectancy AAA is 
becoming more prevalent in aging patients. Elective and emergency procedures in 
elderly patients with AAA are becoming more common, but the indications for 
aortic repair and outcomes in geriatric patients are debatable. In our report, 
we present long-term results of a successful endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) 
of a ruptured juxtarenal aortic aneurysm complicated by hypovolemia and 
myocardial infarction in a 92-year-old patient. No endoleaks or bleedings were 
detected with CT angiography in the post-operative period. After two years 
following the procedure, the patient is doing well and can take care of himself; 
there was no disease progression as confirmed by ultrasonography. In conclusion, 
complicated abdominal aortic aneurysms in nonagenarians can be successfully 
treated by EVAR with fine long-term results.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness and type 2 diabetes have a reduced 
life expectancy compared to the general population. One factor that contributes 
to this is the inability to provide optimal management, as the two conditions 
are typically managed by separate physical and mental health systems. The role 
of care navigators in coordinating diabetes care in people with severe mental 
illness may provide a solution to better management.
AIM: To explore the views of clinicians and people with severe mental illness 
and type 2 diabetes on an integrated health service model with a focus on the 
care navigator to identify potential mechanisms of action.
DESIGN: Qualitative one-to-one semi-structured interviews and part of a wider 
pilot intervention study.
SETTING: Community Mental Health Unit in South London.
METHOD: Topic guides explored the perspectives and experiences of both 
clinicians and people with severe mental illness and diabetes. Data analysis was 
conducted using Thematic Analysis.
RESULTS: From the analysis of 19 participants, five main themes emerged 
regarding the care navigator role: administrative service; signposting to local 
services; adhering to lifestyle changes and medication; engaging in social 
activities; further skills and training needed. The key findings from this study 
emphasise the benefits that the role of a care navigator has in helping people 
with severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes i.e. through diet, 
exercise medication and attending essential health check-ups.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that having a care navigator in place 
empowers those with severe mental illness to improve the management of their 
diabetes. Future research should focus on the extent to which care navigators 
are effective in improving specific outcomes.

    Environ Int. 2022 Dec;170:107641.

The understanding of disease etiology and pathogenesis has radically changed as 
a consequence of the new challenges posed by climate change, environmental 
degradation and emerging infectious diseases. The awareness of the influence of 
distal causes (e.g. planetary changes at the roots of new pandemics), of the 
social environment and of early life exposures calls for innovative models of 
disease onset. Here we propose a scheme for the practice of epidemiology and 
toxicology that incorporates new recent advancements in both disciplines, under 
the general umbrella of the "exposome". The exposome approach to disease 
encompasses a lifecourse perspective from conception onwards, and the 
investigation of the role played by all exposures individuals undergo in their 
lives. These include social inequalities and psychosocial influences, in 
addition to chemical, biological and physical exposures. We stress the role 
played by social differences and inequalities in the course of life as an 
overarching factor that influences downstream layers (including behaviours). We 
show that the idea of "lifecourse exposome" is compatible with the current 
interpretation of Adverse Outcome Pathways in toxicology, and in fact we propose 
an extension of the concept towards "lifecourse Adverse Outcome Pathways". We 
propose to merge different research perspectives and promote an encounter 
between the sociological perspective of "biography" (using Pierre Bourdieu's 
conceptual framework) and biology, according to the idea of accumulated 
biological capital of individuals. We also propose to treat social capital 
(including inequalities) no longer as a confounding factor but as an overarching 
determinant, perhaps the most important of all because it is the one that 
influences all other exposures downstream. The importance of early exposures in 
a lifecourse perspective leads to policy implications, i.e. investing more in 
the various forms of capital (social, economic, cultural) in early life.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing number of breast cancer survivors from improved 
cancer treatments. However, treatments often impair upper limb function, 
specifically range of motion and strength, reducing quality of life and 
function. The primary purpose of this study was to quantify differences in 
strength and range of motion following treatment. The secondary purpose aimed to 
measure the activation of each upper limb muscle in the completion of tasks.
METHODS: 29 breast cancer survivors were categorized into two groups based on 
time-since-treatment: 1) up to 1-year post-treatment, and 2) 1 to 2 years 
post-treatment. Participants completed maximal strength and range of motion 
tasks. During trials eight muscles were monitored bilaterally. Maximal force 
output was taken during strength trials, and kinematics were monitored during 
range of motion trials. A 2 by 2 mixed ANOVA (limb (affected, unaffected) x 
time-since-treatment) examined interaction and main effects of these factors on 
task peak force, angle and mean activation.
FINDINGS: Time-since-treatment influenced strength (flexion, extension, internal 
and external rotation) and range of motion (flexion, scapular abduction), 
wherein the group further from treatment had 11.5-15.5° less range of motion and 
27.7-43.6 N less force production. A main effect of time-since-treatment 
influenced muscular behaviours during both tasks, where activation was higher in 
the group 1-2 years from treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Effects of treatment may manifest in a delayed manner whereby 
strength and range of motion are reduced in breast cancer survivors to a greater 
extent in those who are past 1 year of treatment cessation.

Lead is a naturally occurring metal with a range of industrial applications; 
however, it can cause adverse health effects upon human exposure. Even if blood 
lead levels (BLLs) in the human body are in the acceptable range, it is 
independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading 
cause of death in China. However, the role of lead exposure in CVD outcomes has 
not been quantified well. A top-down approach was adopted in this study to 
calculate the population attribution fraction (PAF) by combining pooled BLLs in 
the Chinese population reported between 2001 and 2022 with the relative risk 
(RR) of lead-induced CVD. Subsequently, the disease burden (DB) of lead-induced 
CVD was estimated and expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
the attribution analysis about various sources of lead exposure was performed. 
Among Chinese adolescents and adults, BLLs of 5.50 ± 2.45 μg/dL resulted in an 
estimated total DB (×106 DALYs) of 2.21 (2.07-2.32) for CVD, including 1.18 
(1.12-1.25), 0.71 (0.69-0.74), 0.23 (0.15-0.26), and 0.02 (0.02-0.02) for 
stroke, and ischemic, hypertensive, and rheumatic heart diseases, respectively. 
Dietary lead intake was a major contributor to the DB (68.1%), and lead ingested 
through food was responsible for 15.1 × 105 DALYs of the CVD burden. Guangxi, 
Hunan, and Yunnan regions in China reported higher BLLs in adolescents and 
adults, and the DB of lead-induced CVD was higher in Hunan, Henan, and Sichuan. 
Lead is a risk factor for CVD that can cause significant DB. Further practical 
and cost-effective efforts to reduce lead exposure are urgently needed.

PURPOSE: To assess the societal cost-utility of the MicroShunt compared with 
trabeculectomy for the surgical management of glaucoma in the US Medicare 
system.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using efficacy and safety results of a randomized 
controlled trial and other pivotal clinical trials.
PARTICIPANTS: Markov model cohort of patients with open-angle glaucoma.
METHODS: Open-angle glaucoma treatment costs and effects were analyzed with a 
deterministic model over a 1-year horizon using TreeAge software. Health states 
included the Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson glaucoma stages (mild, moderate, advanced, 
blind) and death. Both treatment arms received additional ocular hypotensive 
agents to control intraocular pressure (IOP). Treatment effect was measured as 
mean number of ocular hypotensive medications and reduction in IOP, which had a 
direct impact on transition probabilities between health states. Analyses of 
scenarios were performed with longer time horizons. One-way sensitivity and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of 
alternative model inputs. Both treatment arms were subject to reported 
complication rates, which were factored in the model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained.
RESULTS: At 1 year, the MicroShunt had an expected cost of US dollars (USD) 6318 
compared with USD 4260 for trabeculectomy. MicroShunt patients gained 0.85 QALYs 
compared with 0.86 QALYs for trabeculectomy, resulting in a dominated 
incremental cost-utility ratio of USD 187 680. Dominance is a health economic 
term used to describe a treatment option that is both more costly and less 
effective than the alternative. The MicroShunt remained dominant in 1-way 
sensitivity analyses using best-case input parameters (including a device fee of 
USD 0). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 50 000, the likelihood of the 
MicroShunt being cost-effective was 6.4%. Dominance continued in longer time 
horizons, up to 20 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy appears to be a dominant treatment strategy over the 
MicroShunt in the surgical management of glaucoma. More independent, long-term 
studies are required for the MicroShunt and other subconjunctival microstent 
devices to evaluate their use in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the world's population, development, and health by 
condensed Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset to support a normative 
position on how to most defensibly schedule global health teleconferences with 
the primary goal of advancing equitable regard for participants by health 
condition.
DESIGN: Spatial exploration examined through the lens of equitable regard for 
participants.
SETTING: The Earth.
PARTICIPANTS: The global population.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Global population, countries, Human Development Index 
(HDI), and health measured in total and disease-specific disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) per 100 000 per year by UTC offset. Strengths and weaknesses 
of scheduling teleconferences accordingly to alternative approaches.
RESULTS: The UTC offset with the largest population of approximately 1 
724 million persons occurred in UTC+5, largest country count of approximately 40 
countries in UTC+1, and the lowest median HDI of 0.527 occurred in UTC0. The 
highest median total DALYs per 100 000 per year of 41 873 occurred in UTC+11, 
highest median HIV/AIDS DALYs per 100 000 per year of 941 in UTC0, and highest 
median typhoid and paratyphoid fevers DALYs per 100 000 per year of 279 occurred 
in UTC+5. Hypothetical teleconference scheduling scenarios generated temporal 
distances of up to 11 hours to UTC offsets representing the most countries and 
greatest number of DALYs per 100 000 per year. Teleconference scheduling based 
on egoism was considered to be problematic, and contractualism as 
unrealistically demanding. Utilitarianism resulted in the risk of systematically 
disadvantaging small, temporally remote groups. Egalitarianism offered equality, 
but prioritarianism offered the possibility of addressing health inequities.
CONCLUSIONS: Global health teleconferences may generate great temporal distances 
between participants compromising representative participation, as well as the 
well-being of attendees. Our spatial exploration of the world's population and 
health by UTC offset may be used to support a normative position on scheduling 
global health teleconferences that enhance progress towards health equity.

BACKGROUND: The bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers) roots responded 
differently in terms of morphological and anatomical characteristics under 
diverse submergence conditions, and they developed aerenchyma under non-flooding 
condition. In order to understand these mechanisms, bermudagrass cuttings were 
used as experimental material to examine their biomass, root morphology, and 
aerenchyma formation under three different water treatments, including control 
(CK), shallow submergence (SS), and deep submergence (DS).
RESULTS: The total root length, root volume, root surface area, and biomass of 
bermudagrass were largest in CK, followed by SS and DS. However, the average 
root diameter was greater in each of DS and SS than that in CK. Root aerenchyma 
formation was observed in CK, and submergence boosted the aerenchyma formation 
and the root cavity rate. Furthermore, our study found that the process of 
aerenchyma formation began with the increase of cell volume and cell separation 
to form a narrow space, and these cells gradually died to form matured 
aerenchyma cavity, which belongs to schizo-lysigenous aerenchyma. Meanwhile, 
typical biomarkers of programmed cell death were also observed.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggested that submergence inhibited the 
accumulation of biomass and root growth, but facilitated aerenchyma formation by 
increasing root diameter.

BACKGROUND: Designer cellulosomes are self-assembled chimeric enzyme complexes 
that can be used to improve lignocellulosic biomass degradation. They are 
composed of a synthetic multimodular backbone protein, termed the scaffoldin, 
and a range of different chimeric docking enzymes that degrade polysaccharides. 
Over the years, several functional designer cellulosomes have been constructed. 
Since many parameters influence the efficiency of these multi-enzyme complexes, 
there is a need to optimise designer cellulosome architecture by testing 
combinatorial arrangements of docking enzyme and scaffoldin variants. However, 
the modular cloning procedures are tedious and cumbersome.
RESULTS: VersaTile is a combinatorial DNA assembly method, allowing the rapid 
construction and thus comparison of a range of modular proteins. Here, we 
present the extension of the VersaTile platform to facilitate the construction 
of designer cellulosomes. We have constructed a tile repository, composed of 
dockerins, cohesins, linkers, tags and enzymatically active modules. The 
developed toolbox allows us to efficiently create and optimise designer 
cellulosomes at an unprecedented speed. As a proof of concept, a trivalent 
designer cellulosome able to degrade the specific hemicellulose substrate, 
galactomannan, was constructed and optimised. The main factors influencing 
cellulosome efficiency were found to be the selected dockerins and linkers and 
the docking enzyme ratio on the scaffoldin. The optimised designer cellulosome 
was able to hydrolyse the galactomannan polysaccharide and release mannose and 
galactose monomers.
CONCLUSION: We have eliminated one of the main technical hurdles in the designer 
cellulosome field and anticipate the VersaTile platform to be a starting point 
in the development of more elaborate multi-enzyme complexes.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLWH) have significantly enhanced their life 
expectancy. Consequently, age-associated comorbidities and related health 
conditions are increasingly found in PLWH complicating their clinical 
management.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the capacity-motivation-opportunity (CMO) 
structured pharmaceutical care intervention for improving clinical health-care 
results frequently associated to PLWH.
METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, pre-post intervention study evaluating the 
CMO pharmacist-led program in adult PLWH was conducted between September 2019 
and September 2020 with six months of follow-up. The primary objective of this 
study was to determine differences in clinical outcomes (total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, HDL, blood pressure and glycosylated hemoglobin) and variation in 
the patient's activation measure before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included, 72% were men with a median age of 
53 years. After the implementation of the pharmacist-driven program, the 
percentage of patients with high levels of total cholesterol decreased 
significantly (18% to 4.9%; p < 0.001). Similarly, the prevalence of patients 
with high levels of triglycerides, HDL or with hypertension was significantly 
lower post intervention (13.1% to 6.6%, p < 0.001; 47.5% to 6.6%, p = 0.019 and 
24% to 4%, p = 0.009, respectively). The number of patients who achieved the 
highest activation level increased from 69% to 77.6% (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The CMO program resulted in significantly better health outcomes 
during the six months following the pharmacist-led intervention as well as 
improved activation in PLWH.

With the increase in life expectancy worldwide, end-organ failure is becoming 
more prevalent. In addition, improving post-transplant outcomes has contributed 
to soaring demand for organs. Unfortunately, thousands have died waiting on the 
transplant list due to the critical shortage of organs. The success of 
bioengineered hearts may eventually lead to the production of limitless organs 
using the patient's own cells that can be transplanted into them without the 
need for immunosuppressive medications. Despite being in its infancy, scientists 
are making tremendous strides in "growing" an artificial heart in the lab. We 
discuss these processes involved in bioengineering a human-compatible heart in 
this review. The components of a functional heart must be replicated in a 
bioengineered heart to make it viable. This review aims to discuss the advances 
that have already been made and the future challenges of bioengineering a human 
heart suitable for transplantation.

Cancers are generally recognized as the leading cause of death and a predominant 
barrier to prolonging life expectancy in both developed and developing 
countries. Emodin is a typical anthraquinone derivative from various plants that 
exhibits a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as anticancer, 
antibacterial, hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Much previous 
preclinical evidence has demonstrated that emodin exhibits reliable effects on 
several cancer types, including lung cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, breast 
cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer, etc. 
The related molecular mechanisms corresponding to the anticancer activities of 
emodin are involved in the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell 
proliferation, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and 
induction of autophagy, etc. In the present review, we summarized the sources, 
anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo, molecular mechanisms, metabolic 
transformation and toxicities of emodin. In addition, we also discussed the 
limitations of the present investigations of emodin against cancers and gave 
some perspectives for them, which would be beneficial for the further 
exploration and development of this natural compound as a clinical cancer drug.

Single-stage repair of displaced bucket-handle meniscal tears with anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction leads to good meniscal survivorship : a 
retrospective cohort study.

AIMS: The best surgical strategy for the management of displaced bucket-handle 
(BH) meniscal tears in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knee is 
unclear. Combining meniscal repair with ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is thought to 
improve meniscal healing rates; however, patients with displaced BH meniscal 
tears may lack extension. This leads some to advocate staged surgery to avoid 
postoperative stiffness and loss of range of motion (ROM) following ACLR.
METHODS: We reviewed the data for a consecutive series of 88 patients (mean age 
27.1 years (15 to 49); 65 male (74%) and 23 female (26%)) who underwent 
single-stage repair of a displaced BH meniscal tear (67 medial (76%) and 21 
lateral (24%)) with concomitant hamstring autograft ACLR. The patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs) EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS), EuroQol 
five-dimension health questionnaire (EQ-5D), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC), 
and Tegner score were recorded at final follow-up. A Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was performed to estimate meniscal repair survivorship. Analyses were 
performed with different cut-offs for meniscal and ACL injury-to-surgery time 
(within three weeks, three to ten weeks, and more than ten weeks).
RESULTS: Meniscal repair survivorship at a median final follow-up of 55 months 
(interquartile range (IQR) 24 to 91) was 82% (95% confidence interval 70 to 89). 
A total of 13 meniscus repairs failed (12 requiring meniscectomy and one 
requiring a further meniscal repair). At final follow-up, median PROMs were: 
EQ-VAS 85 (IQR 75 to 90), EQ-5D Index 0.84 (IQR 0.74 to 1.00), KOOS Pain 89 (IQR 
80 to 94), KOOS Symptoms 82 (IQR 71 to 93), KOOS Activities of Daily Living 97 
(IQR 91 to 100), KOOS Sport and Recreation 80 (IQR 65 to 90), KOOS Quality of 
Life 69 (IQR 53 to 86), IKDC 82.8 (IQR 67.8 to 90.8), and Tegner 6 (IQR 4 to 7). 
Two patients underwent revision ACLR following further injuries. One patient had 
an arthroscopic washout for infection at 11 days post-BH meniscal repair/ACLR. 
Four patients (4.5%) required a further procedure for stiffness, reduced ROM, 
and pain, and all were operated on within three weeks of meniscal injury. There 
was no difference in the interval between meniscal injury and surgery between 
repairs that failed and those that survived.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that concomitant ACLR with repair of displaced BH 
meniscal tears, even if they have been displaced for some time, appears to 
afford satisfactory PROMs and good survivorship. Repairs within three weeks of 
meniscal injury may be associated with higher rates of postoperative 
reintervention for stiffness. Cite this article: Bone Joint

PURPOSE: To estimate the mortality rates of a cohort of Brazilian patients after 
their first psychiatric admission and determine the possible risk factors 
associated with excess mortality.
METHODS: The study included a cohort of psychiatric patients hospitalised from 
Jan 1, 2002 to Dec 31, 2007 in the catchment area of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo 
state, Brazil. Data were linked to deaths that occurred between Jan 1, 2002 and 
Dec 31, 2016 from the SEADE Foundation (state data analysis system of São 
Paulo). The mortality rate (MR), age-sex-standardised mortality ratio (SMR), 
life expectancy at birth, and years of life lost (YLL) were computed. The 
factors associated with mortality were analysed by survival analysis using a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model.
RESULTS: Of 4019 patients admitted (54.76% male), 803 died (69.74% male) during 
the follow-up (median = 11.25 years). Mortality rates were approximately 
three-fold higher than expected (SMR = 2.90, 95% CI 2.71-3.11). The highest 
mortality rate was noted in men with alcohol-related disorders (SMR = 5.50, 95% 
CI 4.87-6.19). Male sex (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.92), 
higher age (aHR = 21.47, 95% CI 13.48-34.17), and unemployment (aHR = 1.22, 95% 
CI 1.05-1.43) significantly increased the mortality risk from all causes. The 
average YLL was 27.64 years with the highest YLL noted in nonalcohol 
substance-related disorders (39.22 years). The life expectancy at birth in this 
cohort was 47.27 years. Unnatural causes of death were associated with nonwhite 
skin colour and substance-related disorders.
CONCLUSION: An excess of mortality and a significant reduction in life 
expectancy of mentally disordered patients who were first admitted to 
psychiatric beds was noted, particularly patients admitted for substance-related 
disorders, which should represent a priority in mental health policies.

University, Beijing, China.

IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of death in 
children younger than 5 years worldwide. Despite advancing knowledge of risk 
factors and mechanisms related to preterm labor, the preterm birth rate has 
risen in most industrialized countries. Moreover, the burden of neonatal preterm 
birth remains unclear across the world.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the trends in incidence and mortality of neonatal 
preterm birth at the global, regional, and national levels to quantify its 
burden from 1990 to 2019 using data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease 
study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Annual incident cases, deaths, 
age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), and age-standardized mortality rates 
(ASMRs) of neonatal preterm birth between 1990 and 2019 were collected from the 
2019 Global Burden of Disease study. The percentage of relative changes in 
incident cases and deaths as well as the estimated annual percentage changes 
(EAPCs) of ASIRs and ASMRs were calculated to quantify their temporal trends. 
Correlations of EAPC of ASIRs and ASMRs with sociodemographic index (SDI) and 
universal health coverage index were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses.
EXPOSURES: Infants born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation between 
1990 and 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident cases, deaths, ASIRs, and ASMRs of neonatal 
preterm birth.
RESULTS: Globally, the incident cases of neonatal preterm birth decreased by 
5.26% from 16.06 million in 1990 to 15.22 million in 2019, and the deaths 
decreased by 47.71% from 1.27 million in 1990 to 0.66 million in 2019. The 
overall ASIR (EAPC = -0.19 [95% CI, -0.27 to -0.11]) and ASMR (EAPC = -2.09 [95% 
CI, -1.99 to -2.20]) decreased in this period. The ASIR of neonatal preterm 
birth increased by a mean of 0.25% (95% CI, 0.13%-0.38%) in high-SDI regions 
from 1990 to 2019. The ASMR of neonatal preterm birth increased by a mean of 
2.09% (95% CI, 1.99%-2.20%) in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa in this period. A 
positive correlation was observed between EAPC of ASIR and SDI or universal 
health coverage index in 2019, while a negative correlation was observed between 
EAPC in ASMR and SDI or universal health coverage index in 2019 at national 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preterm birth remains a crucial issue in children 
worldwide, with an increasing trend in ASIR in high-SDI regions and in ASMR in 
Southern Sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 to 2019. Efforts to reduce both the 
incidence and mortality of preterm births are essential.
