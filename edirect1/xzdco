were divided into three groups (LS-2; GLFS-25 ≥ 16, LS-1; 7 ≤ GLFS-25 < 16, and 
non-LS; GLFS-25 < 7 points) and each parameter was compared among the groups, 
followed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Next, multiple linear 
regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with the 
GLFS-25.
RESULTS: Of all 281 patients, 241 (85.8%) patients were diagnosed with LS-2. 
Univariate analysis revealed there were significant differences in NRS, PCS, 
HADS anxiety, HADS depression, and AIS among groups. Multiple logistic 
regression analyses showed PCS was significantly associated with LS-2 
prevalence. The GLFS-25 was positively correlated with NRS, HADS depression, AIS 
in multiple linear regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with chronic pain in our outpatient clinic 
had a significant rate of LS-2. The prevalence of LS-2 was significantly 
correlate with pain catastrophizing, and the GLFS-25 was significantly 
correlated with higher pain intensity, depression, and insomnia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine public health and cost consequences of time delays to 
endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients, health care systems, and society, 
we estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of EVT-treated patients and 
associated costs based on times to treatment.
METHODS: The Markov model analysis was performed from US health care and 
societal perspectives over a lifetime horizon. Contemporary data from 7 trials 
within the Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular 
Stroke Trials (HERMES) collaboration served as data source. Aside from 
cumulative lifetime costs, we calculated the net monetary benefit (NMB) to 
determine the economic value of care. We used a contemporary willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY for NMB calculations.
RESULTS: Every 10 minutes of earlier treatment resulted in an average gain of 39 
days (95% prediction interval 23-53 days) of disability-free life. Overall, the 
cumulative lifetime costs for patients with earlier or later treatment were 
similar. Patients with later treatment had higher morbidity-related costs but 
over a shorter time span due to their shorter life expectancy, resulting in 
similar lifetime costs as in patients with early treatment. Regarding the 
economic value of care, every 10 minutes of earlier treatment increased the NMB 
by $10,593 (95% prediction interval $5,549-$14,847) and by $10,915 (95% 
prediction interval $5,928-$15,356) taking health care and societal 
perspectives, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Any time delay to EVT reduces QALYs and decreases the economic 
value of care provided by this intervention. Health care policies to implement 
efficient prehospital triage and to accelerate in-hospital workflow are urgently 
needed.

Greater mortality variability in the United States in comparison with peer 
countries.

Science (IBS), University of Colorado Boulder, USA.

Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.

BACKGROUND: Over the past several decades, US mortality declines have lagged 
behind other high-income countries. However, scant attention has been devoted to 
how US mortality variability compares with other countries.
OBJECTIVE: We examine trends in mortality and mortality variability in the US 
and 16 peer countries from 1980 through 2016.
METHODS: We employ the Human Mortality Database and demographic techniques - 
with a focus on patterns in the interquartile (IQR), interdecile (IDR), and 
intercentile (ICR) ranges of survivorship - to better understand US mortality 
and mortality variability trends in comparative perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to other high-income countries, the US: (1) mortality ranking 
has slipped for nearly all age groups; (2) is losing its old age mortality 
advantage; (3) has seen growth in relative age-specific mortality gaps from 
infancy through midlife; and (4) exhibits greater concentrations of deaths from 
infancy through adulthood, resulting in much greater mortality variability.
CONCLUSIONS: We contribute to calls for renewed attention to the relatively low 
and lagging US life expectancy. The ICR draws particular attention to the 
comparatively high US early and midlife mortality.
CONTRIBUTION: We find comparatively high variability in US mortality. Further 
reductions in early and midlife mortality could diminish variability, reduce 
years of potential life lost, and increase life expectancy. Consistent with 
previous research, we encourage policymakers to focus on reducing the 
unacceptably high early and midlife mortality in the US. And we urge researchers 
to more frequently monitor and track mortality variation in conjunction with 
mortality rates and life expectancy estimates.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) are at increased risk of 
developing non-communicable diseases that could cause significantly lower life 
expectancy when compared to the general population. This study aimed to assess 
the magnitude and predictors of undiagnosed type-2 diabetes and hypertension 
among adult patients with SMI on antipsychotic treatments.
METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 237 psychiatric 
patients from January to June 2019 at Hawassa University Comprehensive 
Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia. All relevant information was 
collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with a 
systematic random sampling technique. A total of 4-5 mL of overnight fasting 
venous blood was collected from each patient. Serum lipid profiles and fasting 
blood sugar (FBS) were measured using the A25™ BioSystem Random Access chemistry 
analyzer. To identify predictors of hyperglycemia and raised blood pressure, 
multiple linear regression analysis was done using SPSS version 23. Statistical 
significance was set at p value < 5%.
RESULTS: From 247 patients with SMI approached, 237 (58.2% male and 41.8% 
females) were take part in the study giving a response rate of 95.9%. The 
overall 31.2% (95%CI: 24.1-37.6) and 27.8% (95%CI: 23.2-33.4) of patients had 
hyperglycemia and raised BP. The magnitude of prediabetes and type-2 diabetes 
was 24.9% (95%CI:19.4-30.4), and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.4-10.1), respectively. While 
the magnitude of prehypertension and hypertension was 23.2% (95%CI: 17.3-29.5) 
and 4.6% (95%CI: 2.1-8.0), respectively. In multiple linear regression analyses: 
age, HDL-cholesterol, physical activity and Triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio 
were positively correlated with FBS. While, HDL-cholesterol, waist 
circumference, physical activity, total cholesterol/HDL-c ratio, and body mass 
index were positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a need to assess blood glucose and blood 
pressure at baseline before the commencement of any antipsychotic therapy and 
during therapeutic follow up to manage any increasing trends. Moreover, close 
monitoring of patients with severe mental illness on antipsychotic therapy is 
exclusively recommended.

ABSTRACT: Aging and average life expectancy have been increasing at a rapid 
rate, while there is an exponential risk to suffer from brain-related frailties 
and neurodegenerative diseases as the population ages. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide with a projected 
expectation to blossom into the major challenge in elders and the cases are 
forecasted to increase about 3-fold in the next 40 years. Considering the 
etiological factors of AD are too complex to be completely understood, there is 
almost no effective cure to date, suggesting deeper pathomechanism insights are 
urgently needed. Metabolites are able to reflect the dynamic processes that are 
in progress or have happened, and metabolomic may therefore provide a more 
cost-effective and productive route to disease intervention, especially in the 
arena for pathomechanism exploration and new biomarker identification. In this 
review, we primarily focused on how redox signaling was involved in AD-related 
pathologies and the association between redox signaling and altered metabolic 
pathways. Moreover, we also expatiated the main redox signaling-associated 
mechanisms and their cross-talk that may be amenable to mechanism-based 
therapies. Five natural products with promising efficacy on AD inhibition and 
the benefit of AD intervention on its complications were highlighted as well.

Demographic and Socioeconomic Disparities in Life Expectancy With Hearing 
Impairment in the United States.

OBJECTIVES: Hearing impairment is one of the most common disabilities among 
older people, and its prevalence will increase as the U.S. population ages. 
However, little is known about social disparities in onset or transitions into 
and out of hearing impairment, nor how these transitions impact years of life to 
be spent impaired.
METHOD: We investigate the number of years an "average" person can expect to 
live with and without hearing impairment after age 50; sex, race, educational, 
and regional differences in these expectancies; and the implication of hearing 
impairment for remaining life expectancy. Bayesian multistate life table methods 
are applied to 9 waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2014) 
to investigate social disparities in life expectancy with hearing impairment (n 
= 20,200) for the general population, people hearing impaired at age 50, and 
people hearing unimpaired at age 50.
RESULTS: Men, Hispanics, persons with less educational attainment, and those 
born in the south can expect to live a larger proportion of their remaining 
lives hearing impaired. Although transitions from hearing impaired to unimpaired 
occur, those with some hearing impairment at age 50 can expect to live more 
years with hearing impairment, and hearing impairment does not shorten remaining 
life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: Significant sociodemographic disparities in hearing impaired life 
expectancy exist. In contrast to past research, we find that hearing impairment 
does not affect total life expectancy. Future research should consider the 
consequences of hearing impairment for years to be lived with other age-related 
and potentially downstream health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of eslicarbazepine 
acetate (ESL) monotherapy during long-term treatment.
METHODS: An open-label extension (OLE) study was conducted in adults completing 
a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial, during which they had 
received monotherapy with either once-daily ESL or twice-daily 
controlled-release carbamazepine (CBZ-CR) for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. In 
the OLE study, all patients received ESL (800-1600 mg/d) for 2 years. Primary 
efficacy outcome was retention time (from baseline of the OLE study). Secondary 
efficacy assessments included seizure freedom rate (no seizures during the OLE 
study) and responder rate (≥50% seizure frequency reduction from baseline of 
double-blind trial). Safety assessments included evaluation of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
RESULTS: Of 206 randomized patients, 96 who received ESL in the double-blind 
trial (ESL/ESL) and 88 who received CBZ-CR in the double-blind trial 
(CBZ-CR/ESL) were treated with ESL monotherapy (89.3% overall). Treatment 
retention time was similar between groups, with low probability of ESL 
withdrawal overall (<0.07 at any time). After 24 months, the probability of ESL 
withdrawal was 0.0638 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.0292-0.1366) in the 
ESL/ESL group and 0.0472 (95% CI = 0.0180-0.1210) in the CBZ-CR/ESL group. 
Seizure freedom rates were 90.6% (ESL/ESL) and 80.7% (CBZ-CR/ESL; P = .0531). 
Responder rates remained >80% in both groups throughout the study. Incidence of 
serious TEAEs was similar between groups (7.3% vs 5.7%; 0% vs 1.1% possibly 
related), as were the incidences of TEAEs considered at least possibly related 
to treatment (17.7% vs 18.2%) and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (3.1% vs 
4.5%). The types of TEAEs were generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of ESL.
SIGNIFICANCE: ESL monotherapy was efficacious and generally well tolerated over 
the long term, including in patients who transitioned from CBZ-CR monotherapy. 
No new safety concerns emerged.

In Ethiopia, evidence on the national burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 
is limited. To address this gap, this systematic analysis estimated the burden 
of CVDs in Ethiopia using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study data. 
The age-standardized CVD prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
mortality rates in Ethiopia were 5534 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5310.09 - 
5774.0), 3549.6 (95% UI 3229.0 - 3911.9) and 182.63 (95% UI 165.49 - 203.9) per 
100 000 population, respectively. Compared with 1990, the age-standardized CVD 
prevalence rate in 2017 showed no change. But significant reductions were 
observed in CVD mortality (54.7%), CVD DALYs (57.7%) and all-cause mortality 
(53.4%). The top three prevalent CVDs were ischaemic heart disease, rheumatic 
heart disease and stroke in descending order. The reduction in the mortality 
rate due to CVDs is slower than for communicable, maternal, neonatal and 
nutritional disease mortalities. As a result, CVDs are the leading cause of 
mortality in Ethiopia. These findings urge Ethiopia to consider CVDs as a 
priority public health problem.

PURPOSE: COVID-19 is a novel threat to patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), 
whose life expectancy and quality (QoL) are impaired by an increased risk of 
infections and stress-triggered adrenal crises (AC). If infected, AI patients 
require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: 
prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and 
association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical 
stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL.
METHODS: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), 
cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 
secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55 ± 17 years) completed telematically three 
questionnaires: the purpose-built "CORTI-COVID", assessing medical history and 
concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, 
occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the 
Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey.
RESULTS: COVID-19 occurred in one (0·8% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with 
primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, 
without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No 
AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 
glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, 
mainly depending on "personal health" in primary AI (ρ = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and 
"economy" in secondary AI (ρ = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions 
increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. 
AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients' QoL.
CONCLUSION: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI 
patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel "CORTI-COVID" 
questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. 
Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL.

BACKGROUND: Lifetime glycemic exposure and its relationship with age at 
diagnosis in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are unknown. Pharmacologic glycemic 
management strategies for young-onset T2D (age at diagnosis <40 years) are 
poorly defined. We studied how age at diagnosis affects glycemic exposure, 
glycemic deterioration, and responses to oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a population-based cohort (n = 328,199; 47.2% women; 
mean age 34.6 and 59.3 years, respectively, for young-onset and usual-onset [age 
at diagnosis ≥40 years] T2D; 2002-2016), we used linear mixed-effects models to 
estimate the association between age at diagnosis and A1C slope (glycemic 
deterioration) and tested for an interaction between age at diagnosis and 
responses to various combinations of OGLDs during the first decade after 
diagnosis. In a register-based cohort (n = 21,016; 47.1% women; mean age 43.8 
and 58.9 years, respectively, for young- and usual-onset T2D; 2000-2015), we 
estimated the glycemic exposure from diagnosis until age 75 years. People with 
young-onset T2D had a higher mean A1C (8.0% [standard deviation 0.15%]) versus 
usual-onset T2D (7.6% [0.03%]) throughout the life span (p < 0.001). The 
cumulative glycemic exposure was >3 times higher for young-onset versus 
usual-onset T2D (41.0 [95% confidence interval 39.1-42.8] versus 12.1 
[11.8-12.3] A1C-years [1 A1C-year = 1 year with 8% average A1C]). Younger age at 
diagnosis was associated with faster glycemic deterioration (A1C slope over time 
+0.08% [0.078-0.084%] per year for age at diagnosis 20 years versus +0.02% 
[0.016-0.018%] per year for age at diagnosis 50 years; p-value for interaction 
<0.001). Age at diagnosis ≥60 years was associated with glycemic improvement 
(-0.004% [-0.005 to -0.004%] and -0.02% [-0.027 to -0.0244%] per year for ages 
60 and 70 years at diagnosis, respectively; p-value for interaction <0.001). 
Responses to OGLDs differed by age at diagnosis (p-value for interaction 
<0.001). Those with young-onset T2D had smaller A1C decrements for 
metformin-based combinations versus usual-onset T2D (metformin alone: 
young-onset -0.15% [-0.105 to -0.080%], usual-onset -0.17% [-0.179 to -0.169%]; 
metformin, sulfonylurea, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor: young-onset 
-0.44% [-0.476 to -0.405%], usual-onset -0.48% [-0.498 to -0.459%]; metformin 
and α-glucosidase inhibitor: young-onset -0.40% [-0.660 to -0.144%], usual-onset 
-0.25% [-0.420 to -0.077%]) but greater responses to other combinations 
containing sulfonylureas (sulfonylurea alone: young-onset -0.08% [-0.099 to 
-0.065%], usual-onset +0.06% [+0.059 to +0.072%]; sulfonylurea and α-glucosidase 
inhibitor: young-onset -0.10% [-0.266 to 0.064%], usual-onset: 0.25% [+0.196% to 
+0.312%]). Limitations include possible residual confounding and unknown 
generalizability outside Hong Kong.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed excess glycemic exposure and rapid 
glycemic deterioration in young-onset T2D, indicating that improved treatment 
strategies are needed in this setting. The differential responses to OGLDs 
between young- and usual-onset T2D suggest that better disease classification 
could guide personalized therapy.

Japan is the world's leading aging society, and increasing medical expenses for 
elderly people is an urgent issue. Since aspiration pneumonia in elderly people 
with impaired swallowing function is a huge problem in Japan, their expected 
long-term clinical course should be clarified. Accordingly, we collected data 
from 991 elderly (≥75 years old) patients whose swallowing function was 
evaluated by Kitasato Institute Hospital's speech therapists (January 1, 2010 to 
December 31, 2017). We analyzed the relationship between swallowing function and 
the subjects' long-term prognosis. To clarify the prognostic factors of patients 
with dysphagia, we obtained their clinical information (age, gender, activities 
of daily living, nutritional status, availability of alternative feeding 
pathways such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and cognitive function). 
We confirmed 372 death cases and stratified the cases into three groups using 
Fujishima's swallowing ability grade, which is used to predict elderly people's 
real-world life expectancy. Results showed the median survival days were 331 and 
952 days in Groups I (Grades 1-3, n = 308) and II (Grades 4-6, n = 153), 
respectively, whereas the median survival days for Group III (Grades 7-10, n = 
530) could not be calculated. We conducted a multivariate analysis using the Cox 
proportional hazards model with Group I, which revealed that initial grade and 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were significant prognostic factors for the 
subjects' long-term survival. Nevertheless, further discussion is necessary, 
particularly to determine advanced care planning regarding indications for 
alternative feeding pathways in elderly patients with severe dysphagia, since 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could significantly prolong their survival.

AIMS: This article sought to estimate the burden of disease attributable to 
atherosclerosis in mainland Portugal in 2016.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The burden of atherosclerosis was measured in 
disability-adjusted life years following the latest 2010 Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) methodology. Disability-adjusted life years were estimated as the 
sum of years of life lost (YLL) with years lived with disability (YLD). The 
following clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis were included: ischaemic 
heart disease (IHD) (including acute myocardial infarction, stable angina, and 
ischaemic heart failure), ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD), and 
peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Years of life lost were estimated based on 
all-cause mortality data for the Portuguese population and mortality due to IHD, 
ICVD, and PAD for the year 2016 sourced from national statistics. Standard life 
expectancy was sourced from the GBD study. Years lived with disability 
corresponded to the product of the number of prevalent cases by an average 
disability weight for all possible combinations of disease. Prevalence data for 
the different clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis were sourced from 
epidemiological studies. Disability weights were sourced from the published 
literature. In 2016, 15 123 deaths were attributable to atherosclerosis, which 
corresponded to 14.3% of overall mortality in mainland Portugal. 
Disability-adjusted life years totalled 260 943, 75% due to premature death 
(196 438 YLL) and 25% due to disability (64 505 YLD).
CONCLUSION: Atherosclerosis entails a high disease burden to society. A large 
part of this burden would be avoidable if evidence-based effective and 
cost-effective interventions targeting known risk factors, from prevention to 
treatment, were implemented.

Older adults with diabetes are heterogeneous in their medical, functional, and 
cognitive status, and require careful individualisation of their treatment 
regimens. However, in the absence of detailed information from clinical trials 
involving older people with varying characteristics, there is little 
evidence-based guidance, which is a notable limitation of current approaches to 
care. It is important to recognise that older people with diabetes might vary in 
their profiles according to age category, functional health, presence of 
frailty, and comorbidity profiles. In addition, all older adults with diabetes 
require an individualised approach to care, ranging from robust individuals to 
those residing in care homes with a short life expectancy, those requiring 
palliative care, or those requiring end-of-life management. In this Review, our 
multidisciplinary team of experts describes the current evidence in several 
important areas in geriatric diabetes, and outlines key research gaps and 
research questions in each of these areas with the aim to develop evidence-based 
recommendations to improve the outcomes of interest in older adults.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a prominent pandemic disease that emerged 
in China and hurriedly stretched worldwide. There are many reports on COVID-19 
associated with the amplified incidence of thrombotic events. In this review, we 
focused on COVID-19 coupled with the coagulopathy contributes to severe outcome 
inclusive of comorbidities such as venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes, 
lung, heart attack, AKI, and liver injury. Initially, the COVID-19 patient 
associated coagulation disorders show an elevated level of the D-dimer, 
fibrinogen, and less lymphocyte count such as lymphopenia. COVID-19 associated 
with the Kawasaki disease has acute vasculitis in childhood which further 
affects the vessels found all over the body. COVID-19 linked with the thrombotic 
microangiopathy triggers the multiple vasculitis along with the arterioles 
thrombosis, medium, large venous and arterial vessels mediates the disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC). SARS-Co-V-2 patients have reduced primary 
platelet production, increased destruction of the platelet, decreased 
circulating platelet leads to the condition of increased thrombocytopenia which 
contributes to the coagulation disorder. Endothelial dysfunction plays an 
important role in the coagulation disorders via increased generation of the 
thrombin and stops fibrinolysis further leads to hypercoagulopathy. Along with 
that endothelial dysfunction activates the complement system pathways and 
contributes to the acute and chronic inflammation via cytokine storm with the 
production of the cytokines and chemokines, coagulation in different organs such 
as lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney and further leads to multi-organ failure.

OBJECTIVES: Durability after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is 
considered an ongoing topic of investigation and was always a point of concern 
with smaller profile devices. Recently released five-year clinical trial results 
using the Incraft® ultralow profile device are encouraging. However, additional 
real-life experience will need to assist these initial findings. Herein, we 
investigated the outcomes after EVAR, in real world practice using the Incraft® 
endograft (EG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA) ≥50 mm in diameter treated with the Incraft® device in three 
vascular centers were enrolled from November 2015 to July 2018. Follow-up was 
completed in August 2020. Selection of EVAR using the Incraft® device was 
individualized according to aorto-iliac morphologic features, comorbidities, 
history of previous abdominal surgery and preference of the patient. At the 
early phase of the study, we specifically opted for preferential use of this low 
profile EG mainly in cases of small and tortuous iliac vessels (more challenging 
access routes). At later stages, it was used according to surgeon preference and 
not specifically in complex anatomies (real-world conditions). End-points 
included technical success, perioperative complications, 30-day survival, 
endoleg patency, presence of endoleaks, sac enlargement >5 mm and clinical 
success.
RESULTS: The primary technical success rate was 97.4% before the addition of an 
aortic cuff and iliac extension for a type Ia and type Ib endoleak respectively, 
and the repair of a maldeployment iliac component (primary-assisted and 
secondary technical success, 100%). Intraoperative small type II endoleaks 
(visible in final angiogram) were noted in 19 patients (24.7%). There were no 
intraoperative deaths from AAA rupture, primary conversions or conversions to 
aortounilateral grafts. Two complications occurred, necessitating hybrid 
techniques for repair (replaced of a dislodged endoleg and distal external iliac 
artery hemostasis). No deaths were reported within 30 days. Occlusion of an 
endoleg, was observed in two patients, 6 and 14 months respectively after 
implantation (2.6%), and were treated by femoral-femoral PTFE bypass after 
unsuccessful endovascular recanalization. The latter required open conversion, 
3 mo later, to repair compromised flow to the inflow iliac axis. Three patients 
(3.9%) experienced sac enlargement >5 mm in diameter compared with the 1-month 
CT scan. All of these had type II endoleaks and two received embolization 
procedures. Eleven patients died from causes unrelated to AAA repair. Clinical 
success was 97.3%, 92.8% and 89.4% through 1, 2 and 3 years respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: EVAR with the Incraft® device might be considered a reliable option 
in real-world conditions and not specifically only in complex iliac anatomies.

INTRODUCTION: Medications are major cost drivers in the treatment of patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease. Recent analyses suggest that there is no added 
efficacy in continuing nor harm in stopping 5-aminosalicylate (ASA) therapy in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease escalated to biological therapies or 
tofacitinib. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of discontinuing 5-ASA therapy 
in patients with ulcerative colitis on biological therapies or tofacitinib, 
compared with continuing 5-ASA therapy.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-ASA with biologic 
therapy and tofacitinib compared with the same treatment without 5-ASA. Our 
primary outcome was to determine whether biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy was 
cost-effective compared with biologic/tofacitinib and 5-ASA combination therapy 
using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at a willingness to pay of 
$50,000/quality-adjusted life year. Owing to the uncertainty surrounding outcome 
probabilities, probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 10,000 simulations were 
also performed. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing 
biologic/tofacitinib and 5-ASA therapy compared with biologic/tofacitinib 
monotherapy, whereby vedolizumab was the first biologic used, followed by 
infliximab and finally tofacitinib.
RESULTS: Our model shows that biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy dominates 
(cheaper and more effective) combination therapy of biologics/tofacitinib with 
5-ASA. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses simulations resulted in 
biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy dominating 100% of the scenarios, with mean 
cost savings of $24,483.01 over 2 years. When vedolizumab was the first-line 
therapy in the sensitivity analysis, biologic/tofacitinib monotherapy continued 
to dominate the combination of 5-ASA and biologic/tofacitinib therapy.
DISCUSSION: This analysis in patients with ulcerative colitis who require 
treatment with biologics or tofacitinib demonstrates that continuing 5-ASA 
therapy is not a cost-effective strategy. Discontinuation of 5-ASA therapy in 
these patients is safe and less expensive and should be recommended.
