RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) showed considerable 
variability in the cost of QALYs spared between patients, with median 
$361,405/QALY for all patients, varying from $54,477/QALY to $1,508,845/QALY 
between individual patients. Proton therapy was more likely to be cost-effective 
for patients with p16-positive tumors ($234,201/QALY), compared to p16-negative 
tumors ($516,297/QALY). For patients with p16-positive tumors treated with 
comprehensive nodal irradiation, proton therapy is estimated to be 
cost-effective in ≥ 50% of sampled cases for 8/9 patients at $500,000/QALY, 
compared to 6/24 patients who either have p16-negative tumors or receive 
unilateral neck irradiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy cost-effectiveness varies greatly among 
oropharyngeal cancer patients, and highlights the importance of individualized 
decision-making. Although the upfront cost, societal willingness to pay and 
healthcare administration can vary greatly among different countries, 
identifying patients for whom proton therapy will have the greatest benefit can 
optimize resource allocation and inform prospective clinical trial design.

The purpose of this article is to stimulate discussion about whether a 
phenome-wide association study is a suitable tool for uncovering late-onset 
risks in patients with monogenic disorders that are not yet fully recognized 
because the life expectancy of people with such conditions has only recently 
extended, and they now reach older ages when they may develop additional 
complications.

The acquisition of neuronal polarity is a complex molecular process that depends 
on changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and directed membrane traffic, regulated by 
the Rho and Rab families of small GTPases, respectively. However, during axon 
specification, a molecular link that couples these protein families has yet to 
be identified. In this paper, we describe a new positive feedback loop between 
Rab8a and Cdc42, coupled by Tuba, a Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange 
factor (GEF), that ensures a single axon generation in rodent hippocampal 
neurons from embryos of either sex. Accordingly, Rab8a or Tuba gain-of-function 
generates neurons with supernumerary axons whereas Rab8a or Tuba 
loss-of-function abrogated axon specification, phenocopying the well-established 
effect of Cdc42 on neuronal polarity. Although Rab8 and Tuba do not interact 
physically, the activity of Rab8 is essential to generate a proximal to distal 
axonal gradient of Tuba in cultured neurons. Tuba-associated and 
Rab8a-associated polarity defects are also evidenced in vivo, since dominant 
negative (DN) Rab8a or Tuba knock-down impairs cortical neuronal migration in 
mice. Our results suggest that Tuba coordinates directed vesicular traffic and 
cytoskeleton dynamics during neuronal polarization.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The 
morphologic, biochemical, and functional differences observed between axon and 
dendrites, require dramatic structural changes. The extension of an axon that is 
1 µm in diameter and grows at rates of up to 500 µm/d, demands the confluence of 
two cellular processes: directed membrane traffic and fine-tuned cytoskeletal 
dynamics. In this study, we show that both processes are integrated in a 
positive feedback loop, mediated by the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) 
Tuba. Tuba connects the activities of the Rab GTPase Rab8a and the Rho GTPase 
Cdc42, ensuring the generation of a single axon in cultured hippocampal neurons 
and controlling the migration of cortical neurons in the developing brain. 
Finally, we provide compelling evidence that Tuba is the GEF that mediates Cdc42 
activation during the development of neuronal polarity.

Psychedelic microdosing describes the ingestion of near-threshold perceptible 
doses of classic psychedelic substances. Anecdotal reports and observational 
studies suggest that microdosing may promote positive mood and well-being, but 
recent placebo-controlled studies failed to find compelling evidence for this. 
The present study collected web-based mental health and related data using a 
prospective (before, during and after) design. Individuals planning a weekly 
microdosing regimen completed surveys at strategic timepoints, spanning a core 
four-week test period. Eighty-one participants completed the primary study 
endpoint. Results revealed increased self-reported psychological well-being, 
emotional stability and reductions in state anxiety and depressive symptoms at 
the four-week primary endpoint, plus increases in psychological resilience, 
social connectedness, agreeableness, nature relatedness and aspects of 
psychological flexibility. However, positive expectancy scores at baseline 
predicted subsequent improvements in well-being, suggestive of a significant 
placebo response. This study highlights a role for positive expectancy in 
predicting positive outcomes following psychedelic microdosing and cautions 
against zealous inferences on its putative therapeutic value.

The current linear no-threshold paradigm assumes that any exposure to ionizing 
radiation carries some risk, thus every effort should be made to maintain the 
exposures as low as possible. We examined whether background radiation impacts 
human longevity and cancer mortality. Our data covered the entire US population 
of the 3139 US counties, encompassing over 320 million people. This is the first 
large-scale study which takes into account the two major sources of background 
radiation (terrestrial radiation and cosmic radiation), covering the entire US 
population. Here, we show that life expectancy, the most integrative index of 
population health, was approximately 2.5 years longer in people living in areas 
with a relatively high vs. low background radiation. (≥ 180 mrem/year and ≤ 100 
mrem/year, respectively; p < 0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]). This 
radiation-induced lifespan extension could to a great extent be associated with 
the decrease in cancer mortality rate observed for several common cancers (lung, 
pancreas and colon cancers for both genders, and brain and bladder cancers for 
males only; p < 0.05; 95% CI). Exposure to a high background radiation displays 
clear beneficial health effects in humans. These hormetic effects provide clear 
indications for re-considering the linear no-threshold paradigm, at least within 
the natural range of low-dose radiation.

Chronic psycho-environmental stress can induce neurological dysfunction due to 
an increase in cortisol levels. It is possible that some food supplements could 
attenuate its negative impact, such as avocado oil (AO), which is rich in fatty 
acids with beneficial effects on the brain. This hypothesis was tested by an in 
vitro model using undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) exposed to 
hydrocortisone (HC), an active cortisol molecule with and without 
AO-supplementation. Cortisol can induce oxidative stress, apoptosis events, and 
a lowering effect on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurogenic 
molecule. As AO protective effects on HC-exposed cells could involve these 
routes, some markers of these routes were compared among neuroblastoma cultures. 
In the first assay, the range concentrations of HC exposure that trigger cell 
mortality and range AO-concentrations that could revert the HC effect. AO at all 
concentrations tested (2-30 µg/ml) did not present a cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y 
cells, whereas HC at 0.3-10 ng/ml had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on these 
cells. From these results, HC at 10 ng/ml and AO at 5 µg/ml were chosen for 
mechanistic analysis. AO was able to decrease the oxidative molecules; however, 
both AO- and HC-induced differential and varied gene expression modulation of 
these enzymes. AO partially reverted the protein and gene expression of 
apoptotic markers that were higher in HC-exposed cells. AO also increases the 
BDNF levels, which are lower HC-exposed cultures. The results indicate that AO 
could be a beneficial supplement in situations where cortisol levels are 
elevated, including chronic psycho-environmental stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: 
Psychological chronic stress that induces high cortisol exposure has been linked 
to premature aging and decreased healthy life expectancy. Neurobiological models 
involving cortisol have suggested a neurotoxic effect of this molecule, 
increasing the risk of psychiatric and other CNTDs. This effect can have a high 
impact mainly in infants and elderly people. In child abuse situations, chronic 
cortisol exposure could induce extensive apoptosis events, causing impairment in 
synaptogenesis. In both age groups, chronic cortisol exposure increased the risk 
of psychiatric conditions, especially anxiety and major depression. However, it 
is possible that the negative effects associated with chronic cortisol exposure 
could be attenuated by some food supplements. This is the case for molecules 
acquired through diet, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including 
omega-3. As inadequate omega-3 levels in the brain can increase the risk factor 
for neuropsychiatric disorders, it is possible to infer that some from food 
supplements, such as avocado oil, could attenuate the neurotoxic effects of 
chronic cortisol exposure. This hypothesis was tested using an exploratory in 
vitro protocol, and the results suggested that avocado oil could be used as a 
cytoprotective food supplement by decreasing the oxidative stress and apoptotic 
events induced by cortisol.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of comorbidities on 
physical function and quality of life of patients at 3 mos after total knee 
arthroplasty.
DESIGN: Data from 140 patients who underwent a primary unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty were examined retrospectively. Comorbidities were osteoporosis, 
presarcopenia, degenerative spine disease, diabetes, and hypertension. All 
patients completed the following: range of motion, stair climbing test, 6-min 
walk test, Timed Up and Go Test, peak torque of the knee extensor and flexor, 
instrumental gait analysis, Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index, and EuroQoL five-dimension questionnaire.
RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed that osteoporosis led to a significantly 
longer time to complete the stair climbing test-ascent, stair climbing 
test-descent, and Timed Up and Go Test and to lower scores for the 6-min walk 
test and peak torque of the knee extensor. Patients with degenerative spine 
disease showed significant negative scores for knee extension range of motion. 
Diabetes showed a negative correlation with peak torque of the knee extensor and 
knee flexion range of motion, as well as a higher Western Ontario McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index-stiffness score. Multivariable linear 
regression analysis showed that Western Ontario McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index-stiffness remained independently associated with diabetes. 
Six-minute walk test, Timed Up and Go Test, stair climbing test-ascent, and peak 
torque of the knee extensors showed a significant association with osteoporosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, particularly osteoporosis and diabetes, affect 
short-term functional outcomes 3 mos after total knee arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: While nonprofessional caregivers often experience a sense of 
fulfillment when they provide care, there is also a significant risk of 
emotional and physical burnout. Consequently, this can negatively affect both 
the caregiver and the person being cared for. Intervention programs can help 
empower nonprofessional caregivers of people with chronic diseases and develop 
solutions to decrease the physical and psychological consequences resulting from 
caregiving. However, most clinically tested intervention programs for 
nonprofessional caregivers require face-to-face training, and many caregivers 
encounter obstacles that hinder their participation in such programs. 
Consequently, it is necessary to design internet-based intervention programs for 
nonprofessional caregivers that address their needs and test the efficacy of the 
programs.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
smartphone app-based intervention program to increase positive mental health for 
nonprofessional caregivers.
METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 3 months' duration. A 
total of 152 caregivers over 18 years of age with a minimum of 4 months' 
experience as nonprofessional caregivers were recruited from primary health care 
institutions. Nonprofessional caregivers were randomized into two groups. In the 
intervention group, each caregiver installed a smartphone app and used it for 28 
days. This app offered them daily activities that were based on 10 
recommendations to promote positive mental health. The level of positive mental 
health, measured using the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire (PMHQ), and 
caregiver burden, measured using the 7-item short-form version of the Zarit 
Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-7), were the primary outcomes. Users' 
satisfaction was also measured.
RESULTS: In all, 113 caregivers completed the study. After the first month of 
the intervention, only one factor of the PMHQ, F1-Personal satisfaction, showed 
a significant difference between the groups, but it was not clinically relevant 
(0.96; P=.03). However, the intervention group obtained a higher mean change for 
the overall PMHQ score (mean change between groups: 1.40; P=.24). The results 
after the third month of the intervention showed an increment of PMHQ scores. 
The mean difference of change in the PMHQ score showed a significant difference 
between the groups (11.43; P<.001; d=0.82). Significant changes were reported in 
5 of the 6 factors, especially F5-Problem solving and self-actualization (5.69; 
P<.001; d=0.71), F2-Prosocial attitude (2.47; P<.001; d=1.18), and 
F3-Self-control (0.76; P=.03; d=0.50). The results of the ZBI-7 showed a 
decrease in caregiver burden in the intervention group, although the results 
were inconclusive. Approximately 93.9% (46/49) of the app users indicated that 
they would recommend the app to other caregivers and 56.3% (27/49) agreed that 
an extension of the program's duration would be beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: The app-based intervention program analyzed in this study was 
effective in promoting positive mental health and decreasing the burden of 
caregivers and achieved a high range of user satisfaction. This study provides 
evidence that mobile phone app-based intervention programs may be useful tools 
for increasing nonprofessional caregivers' well-being. The assessment of the 
effectiveness of intervention programs through clinical trials should be a focus 
to promote internet-based programs in health policies.

BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis is a known comorbidity of atopic dermatitis. 
Dupilumab clinical trials for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults 
showed a higher conjunctivitis incidence for dupilumab-treated patients than 
placebo-treated patients, whereas trials for uncontrolled asthma reported lower 
rates for both dupilumab and placebo.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and 
severity of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials in adolescents with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or uncontrolled asthma.
METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of conjunctivitis in adolescents (aged 12 
to < 18 years) in three phase III trials. Ocular events were diagnosed and 
treated based on patient-reported symptoms and an external eye examination by 
study investigators, in most cases without an ophthalmologic referral. In 
LIBERTY AD ADOL (16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial), 
adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to 
subcutaneous placebo, dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, or dupilumab every 2 weeks 
(200 mg, patients < 60 kg at baseline; 300 mg, ≥ 60 kg at baseline). In LIBERTY 
AD PED-OLE (open-label extension), pediatric patients from previous dupilumab 
atopic dermatitis trials received dupilumab 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg weekly (up to 
300 mg) or 300 mg every 4 weeks. In LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (randomized, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial), patients with uncontrolled 
moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized to 52 weeks of add-on therapy with 
dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebo.
RESULTS: In ADOL, more dupilumab-treated (17/165; 10.3%) than placebo-treated 
patients (4/85; 4.7%) reported one or more conjunctivitis event. All events were 
mild to moderate in severity; 12 (7.3%) dupilumab-treated and 4 (4.7%) 
placebo-treated patients received treatment. Most patients with conjunctivitis 
(dupilumab, 12/17; placebo, 4/4) recovered/resolved during the treatment period. 
The risk of conjunctivitis showed no relationship with dupilumab serum 
concentration. In PED-OLE, 12/275 adolescents (4.4%) reported one or more 
conjunctivitis event. Most conjunctivitis events were mild to moderate. Ten 
patients received treatment for conjunctivitis. Ten patients recovered/resolved 
during the study. In QUEST, similar low proportions of dupilumab-treated (2/68, 
2.9%) and placebo-treated (1/39, 2.6%) adolescents reported one or more 
conjunctivitis event. All events were mild to moderate. One dupilumab-treated 
patient received treatment for conjunctivitis. All cases recovered/resolved 
during the study. No patients in these trials discontinued study treatment 
temporarily or permanently because of conjunctivitis. In ADOL, one case of 
unspecified viral keratitis (specific viral etiology not known) in the dupilumab 
300-mg every 4 weeks group and one case of allergic blepharitis in the placebo 
group were reported; both events resolved during the treatment period, and 
neither led to treatment discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab-treated adolescents in atopic dermatitis trials had a 
higher incidence of conjunctivitis than placebo-treated patients, whereas 
overall rates of conjunctivitis among adolescents in the asthma trial were lower 
than in atopic dermatitis trials and were similar for dupilumab- and 
placebo-treated patients. Most events were mild to moderate, most 
recovered/resolved, and none prompted study withdrawal. These results are 
similar to those reported in adult trials and support a drug-disease 
interaction. CLINICALTRIALS.

BACKGROUND: In a stable, inotrope-dependent pediatric patient with dilated 
cardiomyopathy, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow VAD 
implantation compared to a watchful waiting approach using chronic inotropic 
therapy.
METHODS: We used a state-transition model to estimate the costs and outcomes of 
14-year-old (INTERMACS profile 3) patients receiving either VAD or watchful 
waiting. We measured benefits in terms of lifetime QALYs gained. Model inputs 
were taken from the literature. We calculated the ICER, or the cost per 
additional QALY gained, of VADs and performed multiple sensitivity analyses to 
test how our assumptions influenced the results.
RESULTS: Compared to watchful waiting, VADs produce 0.97 more QALYs for an 
additional $156 639, leading to an ICER of $162 123 per QALY gained from a 
healthcare perspective. VADs have 17% chance of being cost-effective given a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses 
suggest that VADs can be cost-effective if the costs of implantation decrease or 
if hospitalization costs or mortality among watchful waiting patients is higher.
CONCLUSIONS: As a bridge to transplant, VADs provide a health benefit to 
children who develop stable, inotrope-dependent heart failure, but immediate 
implantation is not yet a cost-effective strategy compared to watchful waiting 
based on commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds. Early VAD support can be 
cost-effective in sicker patients and if device implantation is cheaper. In 
complex conditions such as pediatric heart failure, cost-effectiveness should be 
just one of many factors that inform clinical decision-making.

Efforts to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have seen 
non-pharmaceutical interventions being invoked. The most severe measures to date 
include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, 
followed by a "stay at home" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all 
non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are 
presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and 
to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. 
Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts 
regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support 
evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured 
transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring 
hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread 
in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent 
heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces 
a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of 
scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social 
distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients 
requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to 
future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, 
ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing 
measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. 
We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May 
onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system 
being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered 
age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care 
resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of 
strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a 
long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health 
service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all 
individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of 
stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It 
also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured 
approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable 
members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on 
hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.

BACKGROUND: Streptoccocus suis (S.suis) infection is a neglected zoonosis 
disease in humans mainly affects men of working age. We estimated the health and 
economic burden of S.suis infection in Thailand in terms of years of life lost, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, and productivity-adjusted life years 
(PALYs) lost which is a novel measure that adjusts years of life lived for 
productivity loss attributable to disease.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to simulate the impact 
of S. suis infection and its major complications: death, meningitis and 
infective endocarditis among Thai people in 2019 with starting age of 51 years. 
Transition probabilities, and inputs pertaining to costs, utilities and 
productivity impairment associated with long-term complications were derived 
from published sources. A lifetime time horizon with follow-up until death or 
age 100 years was adopted. The simulation was repeated assuming that the cohort 
had not been infected with S.suis. The differences between the two set of model 
outputs in years of life, QALYs, and PALYs lived reflected the impact of S.suis 
infection. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied to both costs and outcomes. 
One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation modeling technique using 
10,000 iterations were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in the 
model.
KEY RESULTS: This cohort incurred 769 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 695 to 
841) years of life lost (14% of predicted years of life lived if infection had 
not occurred), 826 (95% UI: 588 to 1,098) QALYs lost (21%) and 793 (95%UI: 717 
to 867) PALYs (15%) lost. These equated to an average of 2.46 years of life, 
2.64 QALYs and 2.54 PALYs lost per person. The loss in PALYs was associated with 
a loss of 346 (95% UI: 240 to 461) million Thai baht (US$11.3 million) in GDP, 
which equated to 1.1 million Thai baht (US$ 36,033) lost per person.
CONCLUSIONS: S.suis infection imposes a significant economic burden both in 
terms of health and productivity. Further research to investigate the 
effectiveness of public health awareness programs and disease control 
interventions should be mandated to provide a clearer picture for decision 
making in public health strategies and resource allocations.

AIMS: The aims of this study were to: (i) estimate the effectiveness of 
ultraviolet radiation (UV) and sulphuric acid-based fertilizer (SA), at reducing 
levels of generic Escherichia coli in surface irrigation water and on produce 
and surface soil in open produce fields; and (ii) describe the population 
dynamics of generic E. coli in produce fields.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Spinach and cantaloupe plots were randomly assigned to 
control, UV or SA treatment groups. Irrigation water was inoculated with 
Rifampicin-resistant E. coli prior to treatment. More than 75% of UV- and 
SA-treated tank water samples had counts below the detection limit, compared to 
a mean count of 3·3 Log10 CFU per ml before treatment. Levels of 
Rifampicin-resistant E. coli in soil and produce both increased and decreased 
over 10-15 days after irrigation, depending on the plot and time-period.
CONCLUSIONS: UV and SA treatments effectively reduce the levels of E. coli in 
surface irrigation water. Their effectiveness at reducing contamination on 
produce was dependent on environmental conditions. Applying wait-times after 
irrigation and prior to harvest is not a reliable means of mitigating against 
contaminated produce.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results are of timely importance for 
the agricultural industry as new FSMA guidelines require producers to 
demonstrate a low microbial load in irrigation water or allow producers to apply 
a wait-time to mitigate the risk of contaminated produce.

BACKGROUND: There has been a considerable increase in thyroid cancer incidence 
among adults in several countries in the past three decades, attributed 
primarily to overdiagnosis. We aimed to assess global patterns and trends in 
incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents, in view 
of the increased incidence among adults.
METHODS: We did a population-based study of the observed incidence (in 49 
countries and territories) and mortality (in 27 countries) of thyroid cancer in 
children and adolescents aged 0-19 years using data from the International 
Incidence of Childhood Cancer Volume 3 study database, the WHO mortality 
database, and the cancer incidence in five continents database (CI5plus; for 
adult data [age 20-74 years]). We analysed temporal trends in incidence rates, 
including absolute changes in rates, and the strength of the correlation between 
incidence rates in children and adolescents and in adults. We calculated the 
average annual number of thyroid cancer deaths and the age-standardised 
mortality rates for children and adolescents.
FINDINGS: Age-standardised incidence rates of thyroid cancer among children and 
adolescents aged 0-19 years ranged from 0·4 (in Uganda and Kenya) to 13·4 (in 
Belarus) cancers per 1 million person-years in 2008-12. The variability in the 
incidence rates was mostly accounted for by the papillary tumour subtype. 
Incidence rates were almost always higher in girls than in boys and increased 
with age in both sexes. Rapid increases in incidence between 1998-2002 and 
2008-12 were observed in almost all countries. Country-specific incidence rates 
in children and adolescents were strongly correlated (r>0·8) with rates in 
adults, as were the temporal changes in the respective incidence rates (r>0·6). 
Thyroid cancer deaths in those aged younger than 20 years were less than 0·1 per 
10 million person-years in each country.
INTERPRETATION: The pattern of thyroid cancer incidence in children and 
adolescents mirrors the pattern seen in adults, suggesting a major role for 
overdiagnosis, which, in turn, can lead to overtreatment, lifelong medical care, 
and side effects that can negatively affect quality of life. We suggest that the 
existing recommendation against screening for thyroid cancer in the asymptomatic 
adult population who are free from specific risk factors should be extended to 
explicitly recommend against screening for thyroid cancer in similar populations 
of children and adolescents.

OBJECTIVE: To assess practicing urologists' attitudes and perceptions of active 
surveillance (AS) and other treatment options for low-risk prostate cancer.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of urologists practicing in Michigan 
and Georgia. Urologists were asked about perceptions and practices pertaining to 
AS.
RESULTS: Overall, 225 urologists completed the survey; 147 (65%) were from 
Michigan and 78 (35%) were from Georgia. Most urologists reported they provided 
(99%), discussed (97%), and offered (61%) AS to all of their low-risk patients. 
Most believed AS is effective (97%) and underused (90%), while 80% agreed that 
curative therapy (surgery, radiation) is overused in the United States. Although 
most (79%) endorse that Black men are more likely to have aggressive low-risk 
disease, 89% reported feeling comfortable recommending AS to Black men. In 
multivariable analysis, significant provider-related predictors of AS 
recommendation were practice location, number of years in practice, beliefs 
pertaining to survival benefit of prostatectomy and effectiveness of AS, and 
expectation that patients are not interested in AS. The patient characteristics 
of race, age, life expectancy, fear of cancer progression, and fear of treatment 
side effects were also significant predictors of AS recommendations.
CONCLUSION: Most urologists surveyed stated that AS is effective and underused 
for low-risk prostate cancer . Overall, urologists are much less likely to 
recommend AS to younger men and slightly less to Black men. AS recommendations 
varied by practice location and by years in practice. These findings indicate 
targeted educational efforts in the US are needed to influence urologists toward 
greater acceptance of AS.

BACKGROUND: The intermittent administration of seasonal malaria chemoprevention 
(SMC) is recommended to prevent malaria among children aged 3-59 months in areas 
of the Sahel subregion in Africa. However, the cost-effectiveness and cost 
savings of SMC have not previously been evaluated in large-scale studies.
METHODS: We did a cost-effectiveness and cost-savings analysis of a large-scale, 
multi-country SMC campaign with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine for 
children younger than 5 years in seven countries in the Sahel subregion (Burkina 
Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and The Gambia) in 2016. The financial 
and economic costs were analysed from the programmatic perspective and are 
reported in 2016 US$ for each country. The estimated numbers of averted malaria 
cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were based on numbers 
of SMC treatments administered and modelled malaria transmission. Cost savings 
were calculated from a programmatic perspective corresponding to the diagnostic 
and treatment costs for malaria cases averted.
FINDINGS: The total cost of SMC for all seven countries was $22·8 million, and 
the weighted average economic cost of administering four monthly SMC cycles was 
$3·63 per child (ranging from $2·71 in Niger to $8·20 in The Gambia). Based on 
80% modelled effectiveness of SMC, the incremental economic cost per malaria 
case averted ranged from $2·91 in Niger to $30·73 in The Gambia; the cost per 
severe case averted ranged from $119·63 in Niger to $506·00 in The Gambia; the 
cost per death averted ranged from $533·56 in Niger to $2256·92 in The Gambia; 
and the cost per DALY averted (discounted by 3%) ranged from $18·66 in Niger to 
$78·91 in The Gambia. The estimated total economic cost savings to the health 
systems in all seven countries were US$66·0 million and the total net economic 
cost savings were US$43·2 million.
INTERPRETATION: SMC is a low-cost and highly cost-effective intervention that 
contributes to substantial cost savings by reducing malaria diagnostic and 
treatment costs among children.
