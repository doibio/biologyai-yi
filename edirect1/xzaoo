Patients with chronic facial palsy first need an exact classification of the 
palsy etiology. A standardised clinical examination, if necessary MRI imaging 
and an electromyographic examination allow a determination of the severity of 
the palsy and the functional deficits. Considering the patient's desire, age and 
life expectancy an individual surgical concept using three main categories is 
developed: a) early reconstruction of extratemporal reconstruction, b) early 
reconstruction of proximal lesions or impossibility of extratemporal 
reconstruction or c) late reconstruction or congenital palsy. Twelve to 24 
months after the last step of surgical reconstruction a standardised evaluation 
of the therapeutic result is recommended on the one hand to evaluate the 
necessity for adjuvant procedures and on the other hand as a tool of quality 
management and to develop new techniques in this field of relatively of 
infrequent surgery. Principally, controlled trials on the value of physiotherapy 
and other adjuvant measures are missing to give recommendation for optimal 
application of adjuvant therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of naturopathic care (NC) on rotator 
cuff tendinitis using a prospective randomized clinical trial design.
METHODS: Canadian postal workers with rotator cuff tendinitis for a duration of 
>6 weeks were randomized to receive NC (n = 43) or standardized physical 
exercises (PEs; n = 42) over 12 weeks. Participants in the NC group received 
dietary counseling, acupuncture, and Phlogenzym (2 tablets 3 times/day). The PE 
intervention group received passive, active-assisted, and active range of motion 
exercises and matched placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Shoulder Pain 
and Disability Index (SPADI), and secondary outcomes were the pain visual analog 
scale (VAS), Short Form 36 (SF-36), Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile 
(MYMOP), and shoulder maximal range of motion. Participants and assessors were 
blinded to group and placebo allocation.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven participants (87%) completed >or=8 weeks of the trial. 
Final total SPADI scores decreased by 54.5% (P < 0.0001) in the NC group and by 
18% (P = 0.0241) in the PE group. Between-group differences in changes to SPADI 
scores showed statistically significant decreases in shoulder pain and 
disability in the NC group compared with the PE group (P < 0.0001). Significant 
differences between groups were also observed in the pain VAS, MYMOP, SF-36, and 
shoulder extension, flexion, and abduction, with the NC group showing 
superiority in each outcome. No serious adverse reactions were observed.
CONCLUSION: NC and PE provided significant improvements, with greater 
improvement in shoulder function in the NC group compared with the PE group. 
Statistically significant improvements in quality of life measures were observed 
in the NC group as compared with the PE group.

Salpêtrière, Paris, France.

Normal fetal development is dependent upon an intricate exchange between mother 
and embryo. Several maternal and embryonic elements can influence this intimate 
interaction, including genetic, environmental or epigenetic factors, and have a 
significant impact on embryo development. The interaction of the genetic program 
of both mother and embryo, within the uterine environment, can shape the 
development of an individual. Accumulating data from animal models indicate that 
prenatal events may well initiate long-term changes in the expression of the 
embryo genetic program, which persist, or may only become apparent, much later 
in the individual's life. Also, environmental conditions during prenatal 
development may prompt the adoption of different developmental pathways, leading 
to alternative life histories. This review focuses on environmental factors, 
specifically maternally derived molecules, to illustrate how they can influence 
in utero embryonic development and, by extension, adult life.

BACKGROUND: Prompt diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome is very important and 
urgent referral to a hospital is imperative because fast treatment can be 
life-saving and increase the patient's life expectancy and quality of life. The 
aim of our study was to identify GPs' reasons for referring or not referring 
patients presenting with chest pain.
METHODS: In a semi-structured interview, 21 GPs were asked to describe why they 
do or do not refer a patient presenting with chest pain. Interviews were taped, 
transcribed and qualitatively analysed.
RESULTS: Histories of 21 patients were studied. Six were not referred, seven 
were referred to a cardiologist and eight to the emergency department. GPs' 
reasons for referral were background knowledge about the patient, patient's age 
and cost-benefit estimation, the perception of a negative attitude from the 
medical rescue team, recent patient contact with a cardiologist without 
detection of a coronary disease and the actual presentation of signs and 
symptoms, gut feeling, clinical examination and ECG results.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that GPs believe they do not exclusively use the 
'classical' signs and symptoms in their decision-making process for patients 
presenting with chest pain. Background knowledge about the patient, GPs' 
personal ideas and gut feeling are also important.

BACKGROUND: Optimal management of asymptomatic pancreatic cystic neoplasm is not 
known.
OBJECTIVE: In a decision analysis, the cost-effectiveness of different 
strategies for managing solitary, asymptomatic pancreatic cystic neoplasm were 
compared.
INTERVENTION: Three strategies were examined in a Markov model with a 
third-party-payer perspective. In strategy I, the natural history of the lesion 
was followed without any specific intervention. In strategy II, an aggressive 
surgical approach was considered in that all patients were considered for 
resection. In strategy III, an initial EUS-guided FNA with cyst fluid analysis 
was performed for risk stratification, and patients with mucinous cysts were 
considered for resection. Transitional probabilities, discounted cost, and 
utility values to estimate quality-adjusted life years were obtained from 
published information. An operability risk score based on patient age, 
comorbidity, and size and location of the cyst was developed to estimate the 
probability of surgical resection.
RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, strategy III yielded the highest 
quality-adjusted life years with an acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. In a Monte Carlo analysis, the relative risk of patients developing 
unresectable pancreatic cancer was decreased in strategy III compared to the 
other strategies. Although threshold analyses identified few important 
parameters influencing the conclusion of the analysis, operability risk score 
was the critical determinant of the optimal management strategy.
LIMITATIONS: Indirect costs were not considered in this analysis.
CONCLUSION: For asymptomatic patients with incidental solitary pancreatic cystic 
neoplasm, a blanket policy of surgical resection for all patients cannot be 
justified. A strategy based on risk stratification of malignant potential by 
EUS-guided FNA and cyst fluid analysis is the most cost-effective strategy.

Salud, Toledo, España.

OBJECTIVES: Endeavor is a drug-eluting stent (DES) with superior results to the 
bare metal stent (BMS) and similar efficacy to other DES in terms of 
revascularization. The aim of this study was to assess the costs and benefits of 
Endeavor, other DES, BMS and coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model with a 5-year time was used to reflect the management of 
patients with de novo coronary artery lesions in Spain. Model probabilities were 
derived from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials of Endeavor. 
Health resources and costs were obtained from local data and were validated by 
experts. Effectiveness was measured as the number of revascularizations avoided, 
the major adverse coronary events (MACE) avoided and the quality adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Endeavor had higher total costs than the BMS. The cost per 
revascularization avoided with Endeavor was 6,851 euro (at 1 year) and 10,831 
euro (at 5 years). In terms of cost per MACE avoided with Endeavor, the results 
were 7,003 euro and 11,322 euro, respectively, and in terms of costs of QALY 
gained were 132,877 euro, 34,229 euro and 10,505 euro at 1, 2, and 5 years, 
respectively. The budget impact of the progressive introduction of Endeavor 
would be practically null, representing 0.4% of the total cost of percutaneous 
coronary interventions at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Endeavor stent compared with BMS and CABG represents 
efficient resource use in patients with coronary artery disease, with 
cost-effectiveness results below the threshold of efficiency defined in Spain.

20814, USA. mbotteman@pharmerit.com

Chronic primary insomnia is a major public health problem causing significant 
burden for those affected. Rising health care costs may cause increased 
financial pressures on governments and private payers, forcing stricter 
cost-control measures and, as a result, insomnia, often considered a lifestyle 
condition, may not receive the proper attention it deserves. In order to 
highlight the benefits that can be achieved through successful treatment of 
insomnia, there is a need for further comparative studies of existing and 
emerging treatments, cost burden of illness and cost-effectiveness analyses. 
Health economic assessment of insomnia and its treatments is an emerging area. 
The development of comprehensive assessment of insomnia treatments, however, has 
been hindered by complexities and gaps in the available data. Health economic 
models of insomnia, such as the one detailed here, should enable researchers to 
better address the effects of different treatments on clinical and economic 
measures for insomnia and related comorbidities. It is apparent that research 
into the cost-effectiveness of therapies for insomnia is in its infancy and 
further work is needed.

Estimating dementia-free life expectancy for Parkinson's patients using Bayesian 
inference and microsimulation.

Interval-censored longitudinal data taken from a Norwegian study of individuals 
with Parkinson's disease are investigated with respect to the onset of dementia. 
Of interest are risk factors for dementia and the subdivision of total life 
expectancy (LE) into LE with and without dementia. To estimate LEs using 
extrapolation, a parametric continuous-time 3-state illness-death Markov model 
is presented in a Bayesian framework. The framework is well suited to allow for 
heterogeneity via random effects and to investigate additional computation using 
model parameters. In the estimation of LEs, microsimulation is used to take into 
account random effects. Intensities of moving between the states are allowed to 
change in a piecewise-constant fashion by linking them to age as a 
time-dependent covariate. Possible right censoring at the end of the follow-up 
can be incorporated. The model is applicable in many situations where 
individuals are followed over a long time period. In describing how a disease 
develops over time, the model can help to predict future need for health care.

BACKGROUND: Decision making about resource allocation for guideline 
implementation to change clinical practice is inevitably undertaken in a context 
of uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of both clinical guidelines 
and implementation strategies. Adopting a total net benefit approach, a model 
was recently developed to overcome problems with the use of combined ratio 
statistics when analyzing decision uncertainty.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the stochastic application of the model for informing 
decision making about the adoption of an audit and feedback strategy for 
implementing a guideline recommending intensive blood glucose control in type 2 
diabetes in primary care in the Netherlands.
METHODS: An integrated Bayesian approach to decision modeling and evidence 
synthesis is adopted, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in WinBUGs. Data 
on model parameters is gathered from various sources, with effectiveness of 
implementation being estimated using pooled, random-effects meta-analysis. 
Decision uncertainty is illustrated using cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves and frontier.
RESULTS: Decisions about whether to adopt intensified glycemic control and 
whether to adopt audit and feedback alter for the maximum values that decision 
makers are willing to pay for health gain. Through simultaneously incorporating 
uncertain economic evidence on both guidance and implementation strategy, the 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
frontier show an increase in decision uncertainty concerning guideline 
implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The stochastic application in diabetes care demonstrates that the 
model provides a simple and useful tool for quantifying and exploring the 
(combined) uncertainty associated with decision making about adopting guidelines 
and implementation strategies and, therefore, for informing decisions about 
efficient resource allocation to change clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Prognostic information is becoming increasingly important for 
clinical decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an index to predict 5-year mortality among 
community-dwelling older adults.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 24,115 individuals aged >65 who responded to 
the 1997-2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) with follow-up through 31 
December 2002 from the National Death Index; 16,077 were randomly selected for 
the development cohort and 8,038 for the validation cohort.
MEASUREMENTS: 39 risk factors (functional measures, illnesses, behaviors, 
demographics) were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to 
determine factors independently associated with mortality. Risk scores were 
calculated for participants using points derived from the final model's beta 
coefficients. To evaluate external validity, we compared survival by quintile of 
risk between the development and validation cohorts.
RESULTS: Seventeen percent of participants had died by the end of the study. The 
final model included 11 variables: age (1 point for 70-74 up to 7 points for 
>85); male: 3 points; BMI <25: 2 points; perceived health (good: 1 point, 
fair/poor: 2 points); emphysema: 2 points; cancer: 2 points; diabetes: 2 points; 
dependent in instrumental activities of daily living: 2 points; difficulty 
walking: 3 points; smoker-former: 1 point, smoker-current: 3 points; past year 
hospitalizations-one: 1 point, >2: 3 points. We observed close agreement between 
5-year mortality in the two cohorts; which ranged from 5% in the lowest risk 
quintile to 50% in the highest risk quintile in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This validated mortality index can be used to account for 
participant life expectancy in analyses using NHIS data.

Pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes in newly diagnosed older adults.

Spain M(1), Edlund BJ.

Author information:
(1)Adult and Family Nurse Practitioner Tracks, Medical University of South 
Carolina, College of nursing, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.

There is clear evidence that effective management of type 2 diabetes includes 
control of elevated blood sugar, lipids, and blood pressure, along with exercise 
and lifestyle modifications to prevent both macrovascular and microvascular 
complications. However, the target goals and aggressiveness of therapy may need 
to be altered for older adults, depending on the presence of comorbid 
conditions, differences in life expectancy, and individual functional capacity. 
This article provides evidence-based and consensus recommendations from the 
American Diabetes Association and the American Geriatrics Society to guide 
pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes in newly diagnosed older adults.

Secondary autogenous arteriovenous fistulas in the "fistula first" era: results 
of a longterm prospective study.

Salman L(1), Alex M, Unger SW, Contreras G, Lenz O, Asif A.

Author information:
(1)University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Interventional Nephrology, 
Miami, FL 33136, USA.

BACKGROUND: The outflow vein of a dysfunctional arteriovenous dialysis access 
can be used to create a secondary autogenous arteriovenous fistula (SAVF) (type 
I). In the absence of an outflow vein, an SAVF can still be created elsewhere in 
the ipsilateral or contralateral extremity by identifying vessels suitable for 
SAVF creation (type II). But their patency rates and the use of tunneled 
dialysis catheters during the postoperative period have not been reported in a 
prospective fashion.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients undergoing SAVF creation were included in this analysis. 
Data were collected prospectively. The primary, secondary, and cumulative 
patency rates, along with the number of procedures required to maintain patency, 
were investigated. The need for tunneled dialysis catheters in patients with 
SAVF before the fistula was ready to support dialysis was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Sixty-two (type I, n=35; type II, n=27) SAVFs were created over a 
period of 5 years. The primary patency rates for types I and II SAVF at 6 and 12 
months were 87% and 14% (type I) and 71% and 11% (type II), respectively. The 
secondary patency rates for type I at 12, 24, and 36 months were 100%, 100%, 
83%, respectively, and for type II were 92%, 88%, 83%, respectively. The primary 
and secondary patency rates between the groups were not statistically 
significant. The cumulative patency rates for type I at 12, 24, and 36 months 
were 100%, 100%, 94%, respectively, and for type II were 96%, 96%, and 91%, 
respectively. Type I required 1.4 procedures/year, and type II needed 1.5 
procedures/year (p=nonsignificant). Tunneled dialysis catheters were required in 
21 patients with type I and 27 patients with type II SAVF.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary patency rates were not colossal, excellent 
secondary and cumulative patency rates were observed for SAVF in this study.

Optimizing immunosuppression with sirolimus in the first year

of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21202, USA. mweir@medicine.umaryland.edu

Early and late kidney graft survival has improved considerably due to advances 
in clinical care, particularly immunosuppression. Many of the kidney transplants 
functioning today should serve their new owners for their life expectancy. What 
challenges this viewpoint and the main cause of late kidney function 
deterioration remains allograft nephropathy. Often this reflects an influence of 
the immunosuppression. Subclinical rejection, chronic nephrotoxicity, recurrent 
disease, infections, or diabetes may also contribute to this process. Optimal 
early and late immunosuppression is required, which provides efficacy without 
attendent risk for graft dysfunction due to nephrotoxicity. Since 1-year serum 
creatinine level often provides an indication of long-term graft function, early 
evaluation of subtle degrees of graft dysfunction should prompt a graft biopsy 
to identify treatable causes.

OBJECTIVE: This study determined the incidence, type, nature, preventability and 
impact of adverse events (AEs) among hospitalised patients and potentially 
preventable deaths in Dutch hospitals.
METHODS: Using a three-stage retrospective record review process, trained nurses 
and doctors reviewed 7926 admissions: 3983 admissions of deceased hospital 
patients and 3943 admissions of discharged patients in 2004, in a random sample 
of 21 hospitals in the Netherlands (4 university, 6 tertiary teaching and 11 
general hospitals). A large sample of deceased patients was included to 
determine the occurrence of potentially preventable deaths in hospitals more 
precisely.
RESULTS: One or more AEs were found in 5.7% (95% CI 5.1% to 6.4%) of all 
admissions and a preventable AE in 2.3% (95% CI 1.9% to 2.7%). Of all AEs, 12.8% 
resulted in permanent disability or contributed to death. The proportion of AEs 
and their impact increased with age. More than 50% of the AEs were related to 
surgical procedures. Among deceased hospital patients, 10.7% (95% CI 9.8% to 
11.7%) had experienced an AE. Preventable AEs that contributed to death occurred 
in 4.1% (95% CI 3.5% to 4.8%) of all hospital deaths. Extrapolating to a 
national level, between 1482 and 2032 potentially preventable deaths occurred in 
Dutch hospitals in 2004.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AEs, preventable AEs and potentially preventable 
deaths in the Netherlands is substantial and needs to be reduced. Patient safety 
efforts should focus on surgical procedures and older patients.

The roles of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after radical 
prostatectomy, and salvage RT for apparent local-regional recurrence, are 
reviewed. Postprostatectomy patients with pT3N0 disease have improved 
biochemical progression-free survival, clinical progression-free survival, and 
local-regional control after postoperative RT. Although a benefit in overall 
survival has not been demonstrated, patients who have a life expectancy of ≥ 10 
years likely will have improved long-term cause-specific survival if 
postoperative RT is administered. The optimal postoperative RT dose is probably 
about 70 Gy at 2 Gy per once-daily fraction. Salvage RT should be considered for 
patients with local regionally recurrent cancer without distant metastasis and 
those with a biochemical relapse. The optimal dose probably exceeds 70 Gy, but 
is likely not feasible because of the risk of late toxicity. Thus, the preferred 
dose-fractionation schedule is approximately 70 Gy in 35 once-daily fractions. 
The role of androgen deprivation therapy in combination with RT is ill defined, 
but it should be considered for high-risk patients. Similarly, the role for 
whole-pelvis RT is unclear, but it may be considered for those with a ≥ 20% risk 
of positive pelvic nodes.

Neurofibromatosis 2 [Bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, central 
neurofibromatosis, NF2, neurofibromatosis type II].

Neurofibromatosis 2 is a dominantly inherited tumor predisposition syndrome 
caused by mutations in the NF2 gene on chromosome 22. Affected individuals 
inevitably develop schwannomas typically affecting both vestibular nerves 
leading to deafness. Rehabilitation with brainstem implants is improving this 
outcome. Schwannomas also occur on other cranial nerves, on spinal nerve roots, 
and on peripheral nerves. Meningiomas and ependymomas are other tumor features. 
In excess of 50% of patients represent new mutations and as many as one third 
are mosaic for the underlying disease causing mutation. Although truncating 
mutations (nonsense and frameshifts) are the most frequent germline event and 
cause the most severe disease, single and multiple exon deletions are common. A 
strategy for detection of the latter is vital for a sensitive analysis. NF2 
represents a difficult management problem with most patients facing substantial 
morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Surgery remains the focus of current 
management, although watchful waiting and occasionally radiation treatment have 
a role. In the future, the development of tailored drug therapies aimed at the 
genetic level are likely to provide huge improvements for this devastating, life 
limiting condition.

(1)VitreoRetinal Surgery, P.A., USA.

As the estimated life expectancy of the U.S. population increases, so will the 
incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Exudative (or "wet") AMD, 
which is characterized by choroidal neovascularization, carries a high risk of 
extreme central vision loss and can severely compromise an individual's 
independence and quality of life. The increasing burden of AMD has created an 
acute need for more effective treatments. During the last several years, 
treatment of exudative AMD with intravitreal injection of antivascular 
endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has dramatically reduced the severe visual 
loss usually associated with this disorder. This article summarizes the clinical 
presentation of AMD and reviews the treatments that are currently available.

A previous mathematical model explaining dengue in Singapore predicted a 
reasonable outbreak of about 6500 cases for 2006 and a very mild outbreak with 
about 2000 cases for 2007. However, only 3051 cases were reported in 2006 while 
more than 7800 were reported in the first 44 weeks of 2007. We hypothesized that 
the combination of haze with other local sources of particulate matter had a 
significant impact on mosquito life expectancy, significantly increasing their 
mortality rate. To test the hypothesis a mathematical model based on the 
reproduction number of dengue fever and aimed at comparing the impact of several 
possible alternative control strategies was proposed. This model also aimed at 
contributing to the understanding of the causes of dengue resurgence in 
Singapore in the last decade. The model's simulation demonstrated that an 
increase in mosquito mortality in 2006 and either a reduction in mortality or an 
increase in the carrying capacity of mosquitoes in 2007 explained the patterned 
observed in Singapore. Based on the model's simulation we concluded that the 
fewer than expected number of dengue cases in Singapore in 2006 was caused by an 
increase in mosquito mortality due to the disproportionate haze affecting the 
country that year and that particularly favourable environmental conditions in 
2007 propitiated mosquitoes with a lower mortality rate, which explains the 
greater than expected number of dengue cases in 2007. Whether our hypothesis is 
plausible or not should be debated further.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of testosterone treatment 
in hypogonadal older men with subthreshold depression (dysthymia or minor 
depression).

OBJECTIVE: Hypogonadism and subthreshold depression are common conditions in 
elderly men. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of 
testosterone treatment in older, hypogonadal men with subthreshold depression.
METHOD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at a 
university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center among men aged 50 years or 
older (N = 33) with screening total testosterone levels of <or= 280 ng/dL and 
subthreshold depression (dysthymia or minor depression, according to DSM-IV). 
Recruitment for the study was conducted from November 2002 through May 2005. 
Participants received either 7.5 g of testosterone gel or placebo gel daily for 
12 weeks, followed by a 12-week open-label extension phase during which all 
subjects received 7.5 g of testosterone gel. The primary outcome measure was the 
change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score from baseline 
to the end of the double-blind phase. Secondary outcome measures were remission 
of subthreshold depression (defined a priori as a HAM-D score <or= 7) and 
changes in the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale, the Medical Outcomes 
Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the short-form 16-item Quality of 
Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire.
RESULTS: At the end of the double-blind phase, testosterone-treated men had a 
greater reduction in HAM-D scores (p = .024) and a higher remission rate of 
subthreshold depression (52.9% vs. 18.8%, p = .041) than did placebo-treated 
men, but there were no differences in other secondary outcome measures between 
groups. At the end of the open-label phase, the testosterone group had sustained 
improvement, the control group improved, and there were no differences between 
groups in any outcome measures.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that testosterone replacement may be 
efficacious treatment for subthreshold depression in older men with 
hypogonadism. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

BACKGROUND: The obtainment of a large amount of single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) information has emphasized a need for a sensitive, accurate and 
high-throughput strategy for SNP genotyping. We developed a reliable and 
potential microarray-based method to meet this demand.
METHODS: A tag extension strategy is described to identify SNPs. The strategy is 
based on a fluorescent nucleotide extension from an extending primer that is 
hybridized to a bi-functional linker, which acts as an allele-specific primer 
that hybridizes with a PCR-amplified target DNA immobilized on a 3-dimensional 
(3-D) polyacrylamide gel microarray, as well as an extending template with a 
specific tag itself hybridized with a universal extension primer. Multiple 
fluorescence-dNTPs are simultaneously incorporated into the tagged linker.
RESULTS: The method not only significantly enhanced the sensitivity, but also 
efficiently improved the specificity of SNP genotyping. 89 samples for 
8025575C/G polymorphisms in gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, beta 3 (GABAB3) 
gene were accurately discriminated using this method. Sanger sequencing was 
performed to validate these results.
CONCLUSION: Our experiments successfully demonstrated that a tag-extension-based 
method on microarray could be used as a high-throughput and useful tool to 
obtain SNP information.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the long term costs, health benefits, and cost 
effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery compared with those of continued medical 
management for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).
DESIGN: We estimated resource use and costs for the first year on the basis of 
data from the REFLUX trial. A Markov model was used to extrapolate cost and 
health benefit over a lifetime using data collected in the REFLUX trial and 
other sources.
PARTICIPANTS: The model compared laparoscopic surgery and continued proton pump 
inhibitors in male patients aged 45 and stable on GORD medication.
INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic surgery versus continued medical management.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated quality adjusted life years and GORD related 
costs to the health service over a lifetime. Sensitivity analyses considered 
other plausible scenarios, in particular size and duration of treatment effect 
and the GORD symptoms of patients in whom surgery is unsuccessful. Main results 
The base case model indicated that surgery is likely to be considered cost 
effective on average with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound2648 
(euro3110; US$4385) per quality adjusted life year and that the probability that 
surgery is cost effective is 0.94 at a threshold incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio of pound20 000. The results were sensitive to some assumptions within the 
extrapolation modelling.
CONCLUSION: Surgery seems to be more cost effective on average than medical 
management in many of the scenarios examined in this study. Surgery might not be 
cost effective if the treatment effect does not persist over the long term, if 
patients who return to medical management have poor health related quality of 
life, or if proton pump inhibitors were cheaper. Further follow-up of patients 
from the REFLUX trial may be valuable.

BACKGROUND: Limited research has investigated the specific needs of patients 
with advanced incurable cancer. The aim of this study was to describe the 
prevalence of perceived needs among this population.
METHODS: Medical specialists from two regions in New South Wales, Australia, 
identified patients with advanced, incurable cancer, who were estimated to have 
a life expectancy of <2 years and were not receiving formal palliative care. Of 
the 418 eligible patients, 246 (59%) consented to participate. Consenting 
patients completed the Needs Assessment for Advanced Cancer Patients 
questionnaire, which has demonstrable validity and reliability. Patients' 
perceived needs were assessed across the seven domains of the questionnaire: 
psychological, daily living, medical communication and information, symptom 
related, social, spiritual and financial needs.
RESULTS: Patients identified the greatest areas of need in relation to 
psychological and medical communication/information domains. Patients' specific 
needs were highest in dealing with a lack of energy and tiredness, coping with 
fears about the cancer spreading, and coping with frustration at not being able 
to do the things they used to do.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that patients with advanced, incurable cancer 
have high levels of unmet needs, especially in relation to the areas of 
psychological and medical communication/information needs. The data have the 
potential to guide the development of interventions aimed at meeting the current 
unmet needs of patients with advanced, incurable cancer.

Sciences, Kumamoto University, 1-1-1, Honjo, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor efficacy of 
treatment, identify prognostic factors, and construct a prognostic index in 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial 
infusion chemotherapy (TAI) using cisplatin suspended in lipiodol.
METHODS: We analyzed the outcomes in a total of 94 consecutive patients with 
previously untreated hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated by TAI using 
cisplatin suspended in lipiodol.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (29%) showed complete response and 21 patients 
(22%) showed partial response, with an overall response rate of 51% (95% 
confidence interval, 41-61%). The median survival time was 2.5 years and the 
proportions of survivors at 1, 2, and 5 years were 81.6, 65.2, and 18.3%, 
respectively. The results of multivariate analysis indicated a significant 
association of serum albumin > or =3.0 g/dL, maximum tumor size < or =3.0 cm, 
absence of ascites, and unilateral distribution of the tumors with a favorable 
survival. For clinical application, we also propose a prognostic index based on 
a combination of these prognostic factors. Based on this index, the patients 
were classified into three groups: those with good, intermediate, and poor 
prognosis. The median survival times in these three groups were 4.3, 2.7, and 
1.1 years, respectively (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: TAI with cisplatin suspended in lipiodol exhibited favorable tumor 
efficacy and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic 
factors identified and the index proposed based on these factors may be useful 
for predicting life expectancy, determining treatment strategies, and designing 
future clinical trials.

The welfare costs of HIV/AIDS in eastern Europe: an empirical assessment using 
the economic value-of-life approach.

Fimpel J(1), Stolpe M.

Author information:
(1)Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, Frankfurt, Germany.

Based on the aggregation of individual willingness-to-pay for a statistical 
life, we calibrate an inter-temporal optimisation model to determine the 
aggregate welfare loss from HIV/AIDS in 25 Eastern European countries. Assuming 
a discount rate of 3%, we find a total welfare loss for the whole region that 
exceeds US $800 billion, approximately 10% of the region's annual GDP between 
1995 and 2001. Although prevalence and incidence rates diverge sharply between 
countries-with central Europe far less affected than major countries in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltics-the epidemic is likely to 
spread to all countries unless a coherent strategy of prevention and treatment 
is backed up by substantial increases in healthcare investments. The sheer size 
of this task and the international nature of the epidemic render this one of the 
most important current challenges for all of Europe.

Alcoholic liver disease.

Internal Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic. bruha@cesnet.cz

Chronic intake of large quantities of alcohol causes damage to many organs, the 
liver being the most often affected one. In advanced countries, mortality due to 
liver diseases is directly proportional to alcohol consumption. 30 g of pure 
alcohol per day is regarded as a "safe" dose. Alcoholic liver disease may take 
the form of chronic illness (steatosis, steato-hepatitis, fibrosis and 
cirrhosis) or acute involvement (alcoholic hepatitis). Whereas steatosis is a 
relatively benign illness, the presence of cirrhosis of the liver means major 
life expectancy shortening. The actual stage of cirrhosis depends on the 
presence of complications--portal hypertension with bleeding oesophageal 
varices, ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. The median survival time of patients 
with advanced cirrhosis is 1-2 years. Serious alcoholic hepatitis has a 
mortality record of up to 50%. Absolute abstinence is a sine qua non condition 
for any treatment of alcoholic liver disease, the other therapeutic procedure 
are of a supportive nature and questionable significance. Corticoids can be used 
in the management of serious alcoholic hepatitis. Treatment in the stage of 
liver cirrhosis is similar to that in cirrhosis of any other aetiology. 
Cirrhotic patients who demonstrably abstain can be considered for 
transplantation leading to a markedly prolonged life expectancy.
