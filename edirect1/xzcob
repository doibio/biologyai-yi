OBJECTIVE: To assess whether exposure-based internet-delivered 
cognitive-behavioural therapy (internet-CBT) is a cost-effective treatment for 
adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared with a waitlist 
control, from a societal perspective, based on data from a randomised trial.
DESIGN: Within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from the whole of Sweden via primary, 
secondary and tertiary care clinics reached through news media and advertising.
PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (aged 13-17) with a diagnosis of IBS.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to either an exposure-based 
internet-CBT, including 10 weekly modules for adolescents and five modules for 
parents, or a waitlist.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The main health outcome was the quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) estimated by mapping Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory (PedsQL) scores 
onto EQ-5D-3L utilities. The secondary outcome was the point improvement on the 
PedsQL scale. Data on health outcomes and resource use were collected at 
baseline and 10 weeks post-treatment. Resource use was measured using the 
Trimbos and Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Cost Questionnaire for 
Psychiatry (TIC-P) . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were 
calculated as the difference in average costs by the difference in average 
outcomes between groups.
RESULTS: The base-case results showed that internet-CBT costs were on average 
US$170.24 (95% CI 63.14 to 315.04) more per participant than the waitlist. 
Adolescents in the internet-CBT group showed small QALY gains (0.0031; 95% CI 
0.0003 to 0.0061), and an average improvement of 5.647 points (95% CI 1.82 to 
9.46) on the PedsQL compared with the waitlist. Internet-CBT yielded an ICER of 
$54 916/QALY gained and a probability of cost-effectiveness of 74% given the 
Swedish willingness-to-pay threshold. The ICER for the outcome PedsQL was 
US$85.29/point improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering internet-CBT to adolescents with IBS improves 
health-related quality of life and generates small QALY gains at a higher cost 
than a waitlist control. Internet-CBT is thus likely to be cost-effective given 
the strong efficacy evidence, small QALY gains and low cost.

AIM: The aim of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to 
establish the cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) with 
automated insulin suspension vs continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) 
alone in patients with type 1 diabetes in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes 
Model (CDM) in two different patient cohorts: one with suboptimal glycemic 
control at baseline (mean age 27 years, mean baseline HbA1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]) 
and the other at increased risk of hypoglycemic events (mean age 18.6 years, 
mean baseline HbA1c 7.5% [58 mmol/mol]). Clinical input data were sourced from 
published literature, and the analysis was performed from the societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: In patients with suboptimal baseline glycemic control, SAP improved 
quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.77 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vs 
CSII (15.54 QALYs vs 13.77 QALYs) with higher lifetime costs (EUR 189,855 vs EUR 
150,366), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 
22,325 per QALY gained. In this cohort, sensitivity analyses showed that the 
influence of SAP on fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) and baseline HbA1c were key 
drivers of results. In patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia, the gain in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy with SAP vs CSII was 2.16 QALYs (16.70 QALYs vs 
14.53 QALYs) with higher lifetime costs (EUR 204,013 vs EUR 171,032) leading to 
an ICER of EUR 15,243 per QALY gained. In this patient group, findings were most 
sensitive to changes in assumptions relating to the incidence of severe 
hypoglycemic events in the CSII arm.
CONCLUSION: For type 1 diabetes patients in the Netherlands who do not achieve 
target HbA1c levels or who experience frequent severe hypoglycemic events on 
CSII, switching to SAP is likely to be cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: Oncological remission along with high postoperative functionality 
[continence and erectile function (EF)] are the main aspects of prostate cancer 
(PCa) treatment. The aim of this study was to compare functional and oncological 
treatment results achieved after a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) via 
transperitoneal (TPRP), extraperitoneal (EPRP) and robot-assisted (RARP) 
approach.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From March 2015 to March 2016, 507 RP were performed at 
the Institute for Urology and Reproductive Health (Moscow, Russia). A total of 
264 patients with localized (cТ1а-2с) prostate cancer [prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) <20 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤7], intact prostate capsule (according to MRI), 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) ≥19 and a life expectancy >10 
years were included into the retrospective study. All the surgeries were 
performed by a single surgeon. The outcomes were evaluated after urethral 
catheter removal and 3-6-12 months after RP.
RESULTS: Nerve preservation (NP) was performed for 153 patients without 
significant distinctions in time (р = 0.064) and blood loss (р = 0.073). The 
International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence 
Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score was lower for NP: 9.23 ±6.59 and 3.86 ±5.38 after 3 
and 12 months respectively compared with continence after RP without nerve 
preservation (NP): 14.27 ±5.1 vs. 6.15 ±4.76 (р <0.001). Continent was 52.2% vs. 
83.3% vs. 81.8% in TPRP, RARP and EPRP groups; р <0.001. IIEF-5 scores were 
14.67 ±9.4, 4.2 ±4.26 and 4.0 ±2.07 after RARP, TPRP and EPRP respectively (р = 
0.002). After 12 months the PSA: TPRP = 0.11 ±0.19, RARP = 0.03 ±0.05 and EPRP = 
0.53 ±1.87 ng/ml (р <0.001). Outcomes depend on surgical approach and was better 
in the RARP-group (AUC = 0.768 ±0.034 (CI 95% 0,701-0.834; р <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest RARP with NP as a method of choice for treatment of 
prostate cancer in patients interested in preservation of EF and quality of life 
in general.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in the UK. 
Treatments for malignant ureteric obstruction consist of percutaneous 
nephrostomy, ureteric stent insertion, or occasionally other forms of urinary 
diversion. Our aim was to look at the outcomes of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) 
in patients with advanced prostate cancer and to look at the impact on patient's 
general health, quality of life, life expectancy and complications after PCN 
insertion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was done for all 
prospective English language articles on PCN in patients with prostate cancer 
using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane library, 
Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar and individual urological journals from 
inception to August 2017. While studies involving prostate cancer patients were 
included, studies on all other mixed pelvic malignancies were excluded.
RESULTS: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. There were 184 patients, 
with a mean age of 70 years (range: 51-94 years). PCN was performed for ureteric 
obstruction due to advanced prostate cancer, patients underwent unilateral (n = 
66) or bilateral PCN (n = 118) with conversion to an antegrade stent in 25 
patients. Their post-PCN survival varied between 4-31 months and this was longer 
if they were hormone naïve or showed a good recovery in their renal function. 
Although the complication rates were low (1-3%), patients spend a high 
proportion of their lives in the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: PCNs should only be pursued after thoughtful counselling regarding 
further treatment options and prognosis as these patients with advanced 
malignancies seem to have reduced survival duration and spend a significant 
amount of time in hospital.

Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVLM) is an unusual neoplasm derived from uterine 
smooth muscle cells seen in patients with uterine leiomyomas. The typical 
histological features of IVLM consist of benign smooth muscle cells present 
within venous vascular spaces of the uterine wall. Increasing intravascular and 
intracardial spread of IVLM may lead to life-threatening clinical complications. 
Thorough pathological study of routine hysterectomy specimens may lead to the 
diagnosis of IVLM. Most affected patients will be cardiologically asymptomatic 
at the time of diagnosis. Herein, the relatively unknown clinical and 
morphological aspects of IVLM are presented and discussed.

INTRODUCTION: During the last decade, new FVIII/IX concentrates have been 
developed for the treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A/B. Significant 
progress has been achieved regarding their half-life, but the old issue of 
immunogenicity and new concerns about safety need to be addressed.
AREAS COVERED: After the implementation of virucidal methods, both 
plasma-derived and recombinant clotting factor concentrates achieved a very safe 
profile. The development of anti-FVIII antibodies is the major adverse event of 
replacement therapy with both FVIII concentrates. Furthermore, the new extended 
half-life concentrates, protein fused or pegylated, raised some concerns about 
their side effects.
EXPERT OPINION: The treatment of hemophilia A with inhibitors by induction of 
immunotolerance and using by-passing concentrates, improved the quality of life 
of patients but did not allow them to have a life expectancy like that of 
patients without inhibitors. The new humanized monoclonal antibody (MAb) ACE910, 
mimicking FVIII function, seems to be able to reduce the bleedings of hemophilia 
A patients with inhibitors. The post-marketing surveillance will clarify if the 
adverse events observed during the phase III clinical trials and compassionate 
use were due to the association with a Prothrombin activated complex concentrate 
or to the prothrombotic effect of the drug itself.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The current consensus on cilia development posits that 
the ciliary transition zone (TZ) is formed via extension of nine centrosomal 
microtubules. In this model, TZ structure remains unchanged in microtubule 
number throughout the cilium life cycle. This model does not however explain 
structural variations of TZ structure seen in nature and could also lend itself 
to the misinterpretation that deviations from nine-doublet microtubule 
ultrastructure represent an abnormal phenotype. Thus, a better understanding of 
events that occur at the TZ in vivo during metazoan development is required.
RESULTS: To address this issue, we characterized ultrastructure of two types of 
sensory cilia in developing Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that, in 
cephalic male (CEM) and inner labial quadrant (IL2Q) sensory neurons, ciliary 
TZs are structurally plastic and remodel from one structure to another during 
animal development. The number of microtubule doublets forming the TZ can be 
increased or decreased over time, depending on cilia type. Both cases result in 
structural TZ intermediates different from TZ in cilia of adult animals. In CEM 
cilia, axonemal extension and maturation occurs concurrently with TZ structural 
maturation.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our work extends the current model to include the 
structural plasticity of metazoan transition zone, which can be structurally 
delayed, maintained or remodelled in cell type-specific manner.

Fusarium wilt, incited by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, is a 
soilborne disease that affects watermelon production worldwide. Approaches for 
effective management of Fusarium wilt in watermelon are limited. Studies 
conducted in recent years indicated that prothioconazole and thiophanate-methyl 
reduced the disease significantly under field conditions. However, effects of 
the fungicides on different life stages of F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum and 
potential existence of fungicide resistance in F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum 
populations are unknown. In the present study, effects of prothioconazole and 
thiophanate-methyl on mycelium growth and spore germination of F. oxysporum f. 
sp. niveum isolates collected in watermelon fields in Georgia were determined. 
In vitro mycelium growth studies indicated that all 100 isolates evaluated were 
sensitive to prothioconazole; the effective concentration that suppressed 
mycelium growth by 50% ranged from 0.75 to 5.69 μg/ml (averaged 1.62 μg/ml). In 
contrast, 33 and 4% of the isolates were resistant to thiophanate-methyl at 10 
and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Microconidial germination assays showed that 36 and 
64% of the isolates tested were sensitive or intermediately sensitive to 
prothioconazole at 100 μg/ml but the fungicide did not inhibit spore germination 
at 10 μg/ml. Sequencing a portion of the β-tubulin gene of eight isolates 
resistant or sensitive to thiophanate-methyl indicated that fungicide resistance 
was associated with a point mutation at nucleotide position 200, resulting in a 
substitution of phenylalanine by tyrosine. This is the first report of isolates 
of F. oxysporum resistant to thiophanate-methyl. Results of the research suggest 
that prothioconazole may be a viable option for management of Fusarium wilt of 
watermelon whereas thiophanate-methyl should be used judiciously due to the 
existence of isolates resistant to the fungicide.

This paper explores the social inclusiveness of agricultural extension services 
in India. We estimate the probability and frequency of farmers' access to 
extension services and resulting changes in crop income across different caste 
groups. The literature suggests that caste-based social segregation manifests in 
various spheres of life, and perpetuates economic inequality and oppression. An 
econometric analysis of nationally-representative data from rural India verifies 
this with respect to the agricultural sector. Farmers belonging to the 
socially-marginalized castes are found to have a lower chance of accessing the 
public extension services, primarily due to their inferior resource-endowment 
status. Contacting extension agents at least once increased the average annual 
crop income by about 12 thousand Indian rupees per household, which is 
equivalent to 36% of the annual crop income of those without access to extension 
services. There exists significant impact heterogeneity. Farmers from the 
socially-marginalized castes hardly benefited from accessing the extension 
services. Based on these observations, we have developed a number of policy 
recommendations that could improve the social inclusiveness of agricultural 
development strategies in rural India.

Cucumbers were associated with four multistate outbreaks of Salmonella in the 
United States between 2013 and 2016. This study evaluated the fate of Listeria 
monocytogenes and Salmonella on whole and sliced cucumbers at various storage 
temperatures. Cucumbers were inoculated with five-strain cocktails of L. 
monocytogenes or Salmonella, air dried, and stored at 23 ± 2, 4 ± 2, and -18 ± 
2°C. Whole and sliced cucumber samples were enumerated on nonselective and 
selective media at 0, 0.21, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (23 ± 2°C); 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 
and 21 days (4 ± 2°C); and 0, 7, 28, 60, 90, and 120 days (-18 ± 2°C). For 
Salmonella, additional time points were added at 8 and 17 h (23 ± 2°C) and at 17 
h (4 ± 2°C). Population levels were calculated for whole (CFU per cucumber) and 
sliced (CFU per gram) cucumbers. Both pathogens grew on whole and sliced 
cucumbers held at ambient temperatures. At 23 ± 2°C, L. monocytogenes and 
Salmonella populations significantly increased on whole (2.3 and 3.4 log CFU per 
cucumber, respectively) and sliced (1.7 and 3.2 log CFU/g, respectively) 
cucumbers within 1 day. Salmonella populations significantly increased on whole 
and sliced cucumbers after only 5 h (2.1 log CFU per cucumber and 1.5 log CFU/g, 
respectively), whereas L. monocytogenes populations were not significantly 
different on whole and sliced cucumbers at 5 h. L. monocytogenes and Salmonella 
populations survived up to 21 days on refrigerated whole and sliced cucumbers. 
At 4 ± 2°C, L. monocytogenes populations significantly increased on whole (2.8 
log CFU per cucumber) and sliced (2.9 log CFU/g) cucumbers, whereas Salmonella 
populations significantly decreased on whole (0.6 log CFU per cucumber) and 
sliced (1.3 log CFU/g) cucumbers over 21 days. Both pathogens survived on frozen 
whole and sliced cucumbers for at least 120 days. The ability of L. 
monocytogenes and Salmonella to grow on whole and sliced cucumbers in short 
amounts of time at ambient temperatures, and to survive on whole and sliced 
cucumbers past the recommended shelf life at refrigeration temperatures, 
highlights the need to reduce the likelihood of contamination events throughout 
the cucumber supply chain.

BACKGROUND: Medication safety is an important health issue for nursing home 
residents (NHR). They usually experience polypharmacy and often take potentially 
inappropriate medications (PIM) and antipsychotics. This, coupled with a frail 
health state, makes NHR particularly vulnerable to adverse drug events (ADE). 
The value of systematic medication reviews and interprofessional co-operation 
for improving medication quality in NHR has been recognized. Yet the evidence of 
a positive effect on NHR' health and wellbeing is inconclusive at this stage. 
This study investigates the effects of pharmacists' medication reviews linked 
with measures to strengthen interprofessional co-operation on NHR' medication 
quality, health status and health care use.
METHODS: Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in nursing homes in four 
regions of Germany. A total of 760 NHR will be recruited. Inclusion: NHR aged 
65 years and over with an estimated life expectancy of at least six months. 
Intervention with four elements: i) introduction of a pharmacist's medication 
review combined with a communication pathway to the prescribing general 
practitioners (GPs) and nursing home staff, ii) facilitation of change in the 
interprofessional cooperation, iii) educational training and iv) a "toolbox" to 
facilitate implementation in daily practice.
ANALYSIS: primary outcome - proportion of residents receiving PIM and ≥ 2 
antipsychotics at six months follow-up. Secondary outcomes - cognitive function, 
falls, quality of life, medical emergency contacts, hospital admissions, and 
health care costs.
DISCUSSION: The trial assesses the effects of a structured interprofessional 
medication management for NHR in Germany. It follows the participatory action 
research approach and closely involves the three professional groups (nursing 
staff, GPs, pharmacists) engaged in the medication management. A handbook based 
on the experiences of the trial in nursing homes will be produced for a rollout 
into routine practice in Germany.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in the German register of clinical studies (DRKS, 
study ID DRKS00013588 , primary register) and in the WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform (secondary register), both on 25th January 2018.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of 
arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) with arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) in a large 
population-based cohort of elderly patients in the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients ≥75 years old in 
the prospectively maintained United States Renal Database System who had an AVF 
or AVG placed for hemodialysis (HD) access between January 2007 and December 
2011. Outcomes were mortality, conduit patency, maturation, time to 
catheter-free dialysis, and infection. A χ2 test, Student t-test, Kaplan-Meier 
analysis, and multivariable Cox regression analysis were employed.
RESULTS: Of the 124,421 patients studied, there were 19,173 (15%) AVF initiates, 
4480 (4%) AVG initiates, 29,872 (24%) AVF converts, 10,712 (9%) AVG converts, 
and 59,824 (48%) patients who persisted on HD catheters. Compared with AVF 
initiates, relative mortality was significantly higher for AVG initiates 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.24; P < .001), AVF converts (aHR, 1.36; P < 
.001), AVG converts (aHR, 1.62; P < .001), and catheter-persistent patients 
(aHR, 2.23; P < .001). Primary patency (aHR, 1.21; P < .001) and primary 
assisted patency (aHR, 1.31; P < .001) were higher for AVF. Secondary patency 
was higher for AVGs within the first 4 months (aHR, 1.12; P < .001) but higher 
for AVFs beyond that time point (aHR, 1.25; P < .001). Maturation rate and 
median time to maturation were 80% vs 84% (P < .001) and 46 vs 26 days 
(P < .001) for AVF vs AVG.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-emptive AVF remains the best mode of HD in elderly patients who 
can tolerate surgery. Patients who cannot tolerate pre-emptive surgery or have 
to initiate HD on an urgent basis with a catheter should convert to AVF when it 
is feasible if life expectancy is >4 months. If life expectancy is <4 months, 
surgical risk and quality of life should be considered in making the decision to 
persistently dialyze through HD catheter or to convert to AVG.

BACKGROUND: Testing urine improves the number of tuberculosis diagnoses made 
among patients in hospital with HIV. In conjunction with the two-country 
randomised Rapid Urine-based Screening for Tuberculosis to Reduce AIDS-related 
Mortality in Hospitalised Patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, we used a 
microsimulation model to estimate the effects on clinical outcomes and the 
cost-effectiveness of adding urine-based tuberculosis screening to sputum 
screening for hospitalised patients with HIV.
METHODS: We compared two tuberculosis screening strategies used irrespective of 
symptoms among hospitalised patients with HIV in Malawi and South Africa: a 
GeneXpert assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
rifampicin resistance (Xpert) in sputum samples (standard of care) versus sputum 
Xpert combined with a lateral flow assay for M tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan in 
urine (Determine TB-LAM Ag test, Abbott, Waltham, MA, USA [formerly Alere]; 
TB-LAM) and concentrated urine Xpert (intervention). A cohort of simulated 
patients was modelled using selected characteristics of participants, 
tuberculosis diagnostic yields, and use of hospital resources in the STAMP 
trial. We calibrated 2-month model outputs to the STAMP trial results and 
projected clinical and economic outcomes at 2 years, 5 years, and over a 
lifetime. We judged the intervention to be cost-effective if the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was less than US$750/year of life saved (YLS) in 
Malawi and $940/YLS in South Africa. A modified intervention of adding only 
TB-LAM to the standard of care was also evaluated. We did a budget impact 
analysis of countrywide implementation of the intervention.
FINDINGS: The intervention increased life expectancy by 0·5-1·2 years and was 
cost-effective, with an ICER of $450/YLS in Malawi and $840/YLS in South Africa. 
The ICERs decreased over time. At lifetime horizon, the intervention remained 
cost-effective under nearly all modelled assumptions. The modified intervention 
was at least as cost-effective as the intervention (ICERs $420/YLS in Malawi and 
$810/YLS in South Africa). Over 5 years, the intervention would save around 
51 000 years of life in Malawi and around 171 000 years of life in South Africa. 
Health-care expenditure for screened individuals was estimated to increase by 
$37 million (10·8%) and $261 million (2·8%), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Urine-based tuberculosis screening of all hospitalised patients 
with HIV could increase life expectancy and be cost-effective in 
resource-limited settings. Urine TB-LAM is especially attractive because of high 
incremental diagnostic yield and low additional cost compared with sputum Xpert, 
making a compelling case for expanding its use to all hospitalised patients with 
HIV in areas with high HIV burden and endemic tuberculosis.

OBJECTIVE: To report a surgical technique for the treatment of patellar tendon 
ruptures augmented with an internal brace suture tape.
INDICATIONS: Acute patellar tendon ruptures, fractures of the distal patellar 
pole, chronic insufficiency of the patellar tendon or revision surgery for 
failed repairs.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: Severe damage to the surrounding soft tissue. Local 
infection. Life-threatening conditions.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Direct longitudinal anterior approach to the patellar 
tendon. Two parallel transosseous bone tunnels are drilled in the patella and 
tibial tuberosity with a 2.4 mm drill bit. Two separate FiberTapes® (Arthrex, 
Naples, FL; USA) are shuttled through the proximal and distal bone tunnels 
around the tendon in "X" and "O" type configuration. Patellar height is 
reestablished under fluoroscopic control and both FiberTapes are tied down. Both 
tendon ends are debrided and readapted with absorbable sutures.
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Passive motion exercise to 90° of flexion from day 1. 
Partial load to 20 kg of body weight with knee in locked full extension brace 
during first 2 weeks. Isometric exercises from week 3. Passive flexion to 110° 
from week 4 (adapted to pain). Free active range of motion and weight bearing 
from week 7.
RESULTS: In more than 10 years of clinical application, positive results were 
continuously found in acute as well as chronic patellar tendon ruptures. These 
results are consistent with those in the current literature.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Teriflunomide is a once-daily oral immunomodulatory 
agent approved in 80 countries for the treatment of patients with relapsing 
multiple sclerosis (RMS). The study objective was to estimate the cost 
effectiveness of teriflunomide (14 mg tablet, daily) versus interferon beta-1b 
(250 mcg subcutaneous injection, every other day) among RMS patients from the 
Chinese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with annual cycles and a lifetime horizon was utilized 
to assess cost-effectiveness of teriflunomide in comparison with interferon 
beta-1b in RMS patients. Treatment effects, including 3-month confirmed 
disability worsening and annualized relapse rate, were derived from a network 
meta-analysis. Cost inputs included costs related to treatment acquisition, 
administration, monitoring, natural disease management through Expanded 
Disability Status Scale states, relapse treatment, and adverse event management. 
These costs were calculated as the product between unit costs from published 
sources and healthcare resource utilization patterns identified in a survey 
conducted among 11 neurologists across different areas in China. Health effects 
were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with costs in local 
currency (¥) and US dollars (US$), 2018.
RESULTS: Teriflunomide dominated interferon beta-1b and was associated with 
lower total costs (teriflunomide ¥1,887,144 vs interferon beta-1b ¥2,061,393) 
and higher QALYs (teriflunomide 9.60 QALYs vs interferon beta-1b 8.88 QALYs). In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, teriflunomide was dominant in 62.2% of model 
runs.
CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide is a cost-effective therapy over a lifetime time 
horizon compared to interferon beta-1b in the treatment of RMS patients in 
China. Results should be interpreted with caution as head-to-head comparisons 
are not available.

Voino-Yasenetsky, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation.

OBJECTIVE: Introduction: the paper deals with the biological age of women living 
in extreme climatogeographic conditions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The 
aim of the study was to identify the anthropometric characteristics of women of 
yakut nationality (from 18 to 89 years), depending on the rate of aging.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Anthropometric measurements were 
carried out by the classical method of V. V. Bunak. The absolute values of the 
main body components (fat, muscle and bone mass) were calculated using the 
Matiegka formulas. Body mass index (BMI) was determined. The variant of the rate 
of aging was revealed by the value of the rate of aging coefficient (Gorelkin A. 
G., Pinkhasov B. B., 2010). The obtained material was processed using the 
methods of parametric and nonparametric statistics of SPSS 17.0 application 
package.
RESULTS: Results: The age characteristics of the distribution of the rate of 
aging women of Yakutia are revealed. The predominant option of ageing among 
young women, the first and second periods of adulthood was the normal rate of 
ageing, and among older women and senile women was the slow option of ageing. 
The share of accelerated aging is significantly reduced in older age groups 
until complete disappearance in the elderly age group. Women with accelerated 
aging had significantly greater body weight, relative weight of fat component 
than women with other options of aging rate. In terms of BMI, women with 
accelerated aging were significantly more likely to be overweight and obese.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Biological age women of Yakutia has the age features. 
Ethno-territorial features of distribution of variants of aging rate of women 
living in different regions of Russia are established. The obtained results can 
be one of the biomarkers for determining the rate of aging of the female body, 
and used to develop recommendations for improving the quality and increasing the 
life expectancy of the female population of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).

Acceptance of Mobile Health Apps for Disease Management Among People With 
Multiple Sclerosis: Web-Based Survey Study.

Psychopathology, Institute of Psychology, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps might have the potential to promote 
self-management of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in everyday life. 
However, the uptake of MS apps remains poor, and little is known about the 
facilitators and barriers for their efficient utilization, such as technology 
acceptance.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the acceptance of mHealth apps 
for disease management in the sense of behavioral intentions to use and explore 
determinants of utilization among people with MS based on the Unified Theory of 
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).
METHODS: Participants for this Web-based cross-sectional study were recruited 
throughout Germany with the support of regional MS associations and self-help 
groups. To identify determinants of intention to use MS apps, a measure based on 
the UTAUT was adapted with 4 key determinants (performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions) and extended by 
Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and electronic health literacy. Potential 
influencing effects of both MS and computer self-efficacy (C-SE) as mediators 
and fatigue as a moderator were analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macro (SPSS 
version 3.0) for IBM SPSS version 24.0.
RESULTS: A total of 98 participants (mean age 47.03 years, SD 10.17; 66/98, 67% 
female) with moderate fatigue levels completed the survey. Although most 
participants (91/98, 92%) were daily smartphone users, almost two-thirds (62/98, 
63%) reported no experience with MS apps. Overall, the acceptance was moderate 
on average (mean 3.11, SD 1.31, minimum=1 and maximum=5), with lower scores 
among persons with no experience (P=.04) and higher scores among current users 
(P<.001). In multiple regression analysis (R2=63% variance explained), 
performance expectancy (beta=.41) and social influence (beta=.33) were 
identified as significant predictors of acceptance (all P<.001). C-SE was 
confirmed as a partial mediator in the relationship between IU and acceptance 
(indirect effect: B=-.095, 95% CI -0.227 to -0.01). Furthermore, a moderated 
mediation by C-SE was shown in the relationship between IU and behavioral 
intentions to use MS apps for low (95% CI -0.42 to -0.01) and moderate levels 
(95% CI -0.27 to -0.01) of fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this exploratory pilot study indicates for the first time 
that positive expectations about the helpfulness for self-management purposes 
and social support might be important factors to be considered for improving the 
acceptance of MS apps among smartphone users with MS. However, given some 
inconsistent findings, especially regarding the role of effort expectancy and IU 
and self-efficacy, the conceptual model needs replication with a larger sample 
of people with MS, varying more in fatigue levels, and a longitudinal assessment 
of the actual usage of MS apps predicted by acceptance in the sense of 
behavioral intentions to use.
