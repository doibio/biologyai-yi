OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history of clinical, biochemical and 
radiological outcomes of children with FPLD2.
DESIGN: A retrospective case note review of children with a genetic diagnosis of 
FPLD2 who had been seen in the paediatric NSIRS was performed.
PATIENTS: Twelve (5M) individuals diagnosed with FPLD2 via genetic testing 
before age 18 and who attended the NSIRS clinic were included.
MEASUREMENTS: Relationships between metabolic variables (HbA1c, triglycerides, 
fasting insulin, fasting glucose and alanine transaminase [ALT]) across time, 
from first visit to most recent, were explored using a multivariate model, 
adjusted for age and gender. The age of development of comorbidities was 
recorded.
RESULTS: Three patients (all female) developed diabetes between 12 and 19 years 
and were treated with Metformin. One female has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 
four (1M) patients developed mild hepatic steatosis at a median [range] age of 
14(12-15) years. Three (1M) patients reported mental health problems related to 
lipodystrophy. There was no relationship between biochemical results and age. 
Patients with diabetes had higher concentrations of ALT than patients who did 
not have diabetes, adjusted for age, gender and body mass index standard 
deviation scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite dietetic input, some patients, more commonly females, 
developed comorbidities after the age of 10. The absence of relationships 
between biochemical results and age likely reflects a small cohort size. We 
propose that, while clinical review and dietetic support are beneficial for 
children with FPLD2, formal screening for comorbidities before age 10 may not be 
of benefit. Clinical input from an multidisciplinary team including dietician, 
psychologist and clinician should be offered after diagnosis.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex multiorgan disease, which often affects the 
gastrointestinal tract. With improved CF specific therapies and 
multidisciplinary management, patients with CF are now living longer with a 
median life expectancy of around 50 years. This increased life expectancy has 
resulted in corresponding increase in presentations of the CF patient with 
comorbid surgical conditions that were never important considerations. 
Investigations and management of these conditions, such as distal intestinal 
obstruction syndrome and colorectal cancer warrant good clinical understanding 
of the unique challenges that CF patients present including chronic 
immunosuppression, impaired respiratory function and their multi-organ 
dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to provide general surgeons with a 
contemporary update on the CF related surgical issues as they are likely to 
become increasingly involved in the care of these complex patients and form an 
integral part of the multidisciplinary team.

A gradual move to proactive illness prevention requires a strategic shift 
towards population health management by health care systems. Such a shift 
becomes necessary to improve outcomes, reduce inequalities and manage 
costs better, as life expectancy increases and chronic illness becomes more 
prevalent. Health system digitisation and greater focus on virtual health care 
(VHC) can contribute to active population health management. For that to 
happen, health systems need to address and overcome several challenges currently 
preventing the rapid introduction and scale up of VHC for population health; 
these include implementing changes in care models and focus on digitally enabled 
population health approaches; addressing culture and mindset barriers; resolving 
regulatory bottlenecks; overcoming technical limitations, inter-operability and 
data security issues; and, finally, aligning stakeholder incentives and 
expectations.

BACKGROUND: Although biological aging has been proposed as a more accurate 
measure of aging, few biological aging measures have been developed for Asians, 
especially for young adults.
METHODS: A total of 521 656 participants were enrolled in the MJ cohort 
(1996-2011) and were followed until death, loss-to-follow-up, or December 31, 
2011, whichever came first. We selected 14 clinical biomarkers, including 
chronological age, using a random forest algorithm, and developed a 
multidimensional aging measure (MDAge). Model performance was assessed by area 
under the curve (AUC) and internal calibration. We evaluated the associations of 
MDAge and residuals from regressing MDAge on chronological age (MDAgeAccel) with 
mortality and morbidity, and assessed the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: MDAge achieved an excellent AUC of 0.892 in predicting all-cause 
mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.889-0.894). Participants with higher 
MDAge at baseline were at a higher risk of death (per 5 years, hazard ration 
[HR] = 1.671, 95% CI: 1.662-1.680), and the association remained after 
controlling for other variables and in different subgroups. Furthermore, 
participants with higher MDAgeAccel were associated with shortened life 
expectancy. For instance, compared to men who were biologically younger 
(MDAgeAccel ≤ 0) at baseline, men in the highest tertiles of MDAgeAccel had 
shortened life expectancy by 17.23 years. In addition, higher MDAgeAccel was 
associated with having chronic disease either cross-sectionally (per 1-standard 
deviation [SD], odds ratio [OR] = 1.564, 95% CI: 1.552-1.575) or longitudinally 
(per 1-SD, OR = 1.218, 95% CI: 1.199-1.238).
CONCLUSION: MDAge accurately predicted mortality and morbidity, which has great 
potential in the early identification of individuals at higher risk and 
therefore promoting early intervention.

Increased life expectancy has led to an increase in the use of bone substitutes 
in numerous nations, with over two million bone-grafting surgeries performed 
worldwide each year. A bone defect can be caused by trauma, infections, and 
tissue resections which can self-heal due to the osteoconductive nature of the 
native extracellular matrix components. However, natural self-healing is 
time-consuming, and new bone regeneration is slow, especially for large bone 
defects. It also remains a clinical challenge for surgeons to have a suitable 
bone substitute. To date, there are numerous potential treatments for bone 
grafting, including gold-standard autografts, allograft implantation, 
xenografts, or bone graft substitutes. Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and 
hydroxyapatite (HA) are the most extensively used and studied bone substitutes 
due to their similar chemical composition to bone. The scaffolds should be 
testedin vivoandin vitrousing suitable animal models to ensure that the 
biomaterials work effectively as implants. Hence, this article aims to 
familiarize readers with the most frequently used animal models for biomaterials 
testing and highlight the available literature forin vivostudies using small and 
large animal models. This review summarizes the bioceramic materials, 
particularly HA andβ-TCP scaffolds, for bone defects in small and large animal 
models. Besides, the design considerations for the pre-clinical animal model 
selection for bone defect implants are emphasized and presented.

A 2020 World Health Organization report underscored the impact of rising 
healthcare spending globally and questioned the long-term economic 
sustainability of current funding models. Increases in costs associated with 
care of late-stage irreversible diseases and the increasing prevalence of 
debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, coupled with increases in life 
expectancy are likely to overload the healthcare systems in many nations within 
the next decade if not addressed. One option for sustainability of the 
healthcare system is a change in emphasis from illness to wellness centered 
care. An attractive model is the P4 (Predictive, Preventative, Personalized and 
Participatory) medicine approach. Recent advances in connected health technology 
can help accelerate this transition; they offer prediction, diagnosis, and 
monitoring of health-related parameters. We explain how to integrate such 
technologies with conventional approaches and guide public health policy toward 
wellness-based care models and strategies to relieve the escalating economic 
burdens of managed care.

In the twenty-first century, exposure to air pollution has become a threat to 
human health worldwide due to industrial development. Timely, comprehensive, and 
reliable assessment and prediction of disease burden can help mitigate the 
health hazards of air pollution. This study conducted a two-stage analysis. 
First, we reported the air pollution-related disease burden globally and for 
different subgroups like socio-demographic index (SDI), sex, and age. We 
analyzed the trend of the disease burden from 1990 to 2019. In addition, we 
explored whether and how some national indicators modified the disease burden. 
Second, we predicted the number and the age-standardized rates of death and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution from 2020 
to 2044 by the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and 
exponential smoothing model. The age-period-cohort (APC) model in the maximum 
likelihood framework and the Bayesian APC model integrated nested Laplace 
approximations (INLAs) were further applied to perform sensitivity analysis. In 
2019, air pollution accounted for 11.62% of death and 0.84% of DALY worldwide. 
The corresponding age-standardized rate was 85.62 (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI): 75.71, 96.07) and 2791.08 (95% UI: 2468.81, 3141.39) per 100,000 
population. From 1990 to 2019, the number of death attributable to air pollution 
remained stable, and the number of DALY exhibited a downward trend. The 
corresponding age-standardized rates both declined. In some countries with 
larger population densities, higher proportions of elders, and lower proportions 
of females, the disease burden attributable to air pollution was lower. The 
predicted results showed that the number of air pollution-related death and DALY 
would increase. This study comprehensively assessed and predicted the air 
pollution-related disease burden worldwide. The results indicated that the 
disease burden would remain very serious in the future. Hence, some relevant 
policies should be developed to prevent and manage air pollution.

OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the valuation of the classification system for 
the Quality-of-Life Aged Care Consumers (QOL-ACC) instrument using a discrete 
choice experiment (DCE) with duration with a large sample of older people 
receiving aged care services.
METHODS: A DCE with 160 choice sets of two quality-of-life state-survival 
duration combinations blocked into 20 survey versions, with eight choice sets in 
each version, was designed and administered through an on-line survey to older 
Australians receiving aged care services in home and via interviewer 
facilitation with older people in residential aged care settings. Model 
specifications investigating preferences with respect to survival duration and 
interactions between QOL-ACC dimension levels were estimated. Utility weights 
were developed, with estimated coefficients transformed to the 0 (being dead) to 
1 (full health) scale to generate a value set suitable for application in 
quality assessment and for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years for 
use in economic evaluation.
RESULTS: In total, 953 older people completed the choice experiment with valid 
responses. The estimation results from econometric model specifications 
indicated that utility increased with survival duration and decreased according 
to quality-of-life impairment levels. An Australian value set (range - 0.56 to 
1.00) was generated for the calculation of utilities for all QOL-ACC states.
CONCLUSION: The QOL-ACC is unique in its focus on measuring and valuing quality 
of life from the perspective of older people themselves, thereby ensuring that 
the preferences of aged care service users are the primary focus for quality 
assessment and economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: This study assessed health inequality in the global burden of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) between 1990 and 2019 using data 
extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD 2019) study.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the GBD 2019 study. A series of comparative 
and descriptive analyses of the disease burden between women and men in 
countries with different socioeconomic development (SDI) status were performed. 
The slope index of inequality (SII), relative index of inequality (RII), and 
concentration index (CI) were calculated to measure the socioeconomic-related 
cross-national health inequity between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: The global health burden caused by COPD increased by 25.7% in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) from 59.2 million years in 1990 to 74.4 
million years in 2019. Global age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) associated with 
COPD decreased by 40.0%, from 1537.7 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 926.1 per 
100,000 population in 2019. The highest sex-specific DALY number was at age 
70-74 in male and female, and female is lower than male. However, after 
controlling for population size, the burden of COPD is more concentrated in the 
population living in low SDI countries, relative health inequality indicators 
(RII and CI) supported this conclusion.
CONCLUSION: The health inequalities caused by the disparity of socioeconomic 
status are increasing, and the increasing concentration of wealth worldwide is 
likely to aggravate health inequalities associated with COPD.

P. trituberculatus is an economically important mariculture species in China. 
Evaluating its genetic diversity and population structure can contribute to the 
exploration of germplasm resources and promote sustainable aquaculture 
production. In this study, a total of 246,243 SSRs were generated by 
transcriptome sequencing of P. trituberculatus. Among the examined 254,746 
unigenes, 66,331 had more than one SSR. Among the different SSR motif types, 
dinucleotide repeats (110,758, 44.98%) were the most abundant. In 173 different 
base repeats, A/T (96.86%), AC/GT (51.46%), and ACC/GGT (26.20%) were dominant 
in mono-, di-, and trinucleotide, respectively. GO annotations showed 87,079 
unigenes in 57 GO terms. Cellular process, cell, and binding were the most 
abundant terms in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function 
categories separately. A total of 34,406 annotated unigenes were classified into 
26 functional categories according to the functional annotation analysis of KOG, 
of which "general function prediction only" was the biggest category (6,028 
unigenes, 17.52%). KEGG pathway annotations revealed the clustering of 34,715 
unigenes into 32 different pathways. Nineteen SSRs were identified as 
polymorphic and, thus, used to assess the genetic diversity and structure of 240 
P. trituberculatus individuals from four populations in the Bohai Sea. Genetic 
parameter analysis showed a similar level of genetic diversity within wild 
populations, and the cultured population indicated a reduction in genetic 
diversity compared with wild populations. The pairwise FST values were between 
0.001 and 0.04 with an average of 0.0205 (p < 0.05), suggesting a low but 
significant level of genetic differentiation among the four populations. 
Structure analysis demonstrated that the four populations were classified into 
two groups including the cultured group and other populations. The phylogenetic 
tree and PCA revealed that a vast number of samples were clustered together and 
that cultivated individuals were distributed more centrally than wild 
individuals. The findings contribute to the further assessment of germplasm 
resources and assist to provide valuable SSRs for marker-assisted breeding of P. 
trituberculatus in the future.

Changes and Trend Disparities in Life Expectancy and Health-Adjusted Life 
Expectancy Attributed to Disability and Mortality From 1990 to 2019 in China.

Prevention, Wuxi, China.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate sex, age, and cause-specific 
contributions to changes and trend disparities in life expectancy (LE) and 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) attributed to disability and mortality 
from 1990 to 2019 in China, which provides insight into policy-making, health 
systems planning, and resource allocation.
METHODS: Contributions of disability and mortality to changes and trend 
disparities in LE and HALE were estimated with standard abridged life table, 
Sullivan's method, and decomposition method, using retrospective demographic 
analysis based on mortality and years lived with disability (YLD) rates 
extracted from Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019).
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, LE and HALE increased by 10.49 and 8.71 years for 
both sexes, mainly due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) (5.83 years, 55.58% 
for LE and 6.28 years, 72.10% for HALE). However, HIV/AIDS and sexually 
transmitted infections had negative effects on changes in LE (-0.03 years, 
-0.29%) and HALE (-0.05 years, -0.57%). Lung cancer and ischemic heart disease 
caused the biggest reduction in LE (-0.14 years, -1.33%) and HALE (-0.42 years, 
-4.82%). Also, cardiovascular diseases (-0.08 years, -0.92%), neurological 
disorders (-0.08 years, -0.92%), diabetes and kidney diseases (-0.06 years, 
-0.69%), and transport injuries (-0.06 years, -0.69%) had main negative 
disability effects in HALE. Moreover, life expectancy lived with disability 
(LED) increased by 1.78 years, mainly attributed to respiratory infections and 
tuberculosis (1.04 years, 58.43%) and maternal and neonatal disorders (0.78 
years, 43.82%).
CONCLUSION: The LE and HALE in China have grown rapidly over the past few 
decades, mainly attributed to NCDs. It is necessary to further reduce the 
negative mortality effect of HIV/AIDS, lung cancer, colon and rectum cancer, 
pancreatic cancer, and ischemic heart disease and the negative disability effect 
of stroke, diabetes mellitus, and road injuries. In addition, the signs of 
disparities in mortality and disability of different sexes and ages call for 
targeted and precise interventions for key groups such as males and the elderly. 
According to the decomposition results, we may better determine the key objects

Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as 
first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). Materials & 
methods: A Markov model was established for the analysis. Parametric survival 
models were used to fit to progression-free survival and overall survival data 
in the IMvigor130 study. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. Results: The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alone were US$475,633.17 and $207,488.17 per quality-adjusted life 
year in the USA and China, respectively. Utility for the progression-free 
survival and progressive disease states, the cost of atezolizumab had the most 
significant impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Conclusion: 
Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy is not a cost-effective treatment option as a 
first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer.

BACKGROUND: High fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) is the leading risk factor 
contributing to the increase of stroke burden in the past three decades. 
However, the global distribution of stroke burden specifically attributable to 
HFPG was not studied in depth. Therefore, we analyzed the HFPG-attributable 
burden in stroke and its subtypes in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: Detailed data on stroke burden attributable to HFPG were obtained from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The numbers and age-standardized rates 
of stroke disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), deaths, years lived with 
disability, and years of life lost between 1990 and 2019 were estimated by age, 
sex, and region.
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized rate of DALYs (ASDR) of HFPG-attributable 
stroke was 354.95 per 100 000 population, among which 49.0% was from ischemic 
stroke, 44.3% from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 6.6% from subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. The ASDRs of HFPG-attributable stroke in lower sociodemographic 
index (SDI) regions surpassed those in higher SDI regions in the past three 
decades. Generally, the population aged over 50 years old accounted for 92% of 
stroke DALYs attributable to HFPG, and males are more susceptible to 
HFPG-attributable stroke than females across their lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful key population initiatives targeting HFPG may mitigate 
the stroke disease burden. Given the soaring population-attributable fractions 
of HFPG for stroke burden worldwide, each country should assess its disease 
burden and determine targeted prevention and control strategies.

Publisher: 背景: 在过去30年中, 空腹血糖升高(HFPG)是导致卒中负担增加的主要危险因素。然而, 
HFPG导致的卒中负担的全球分布并未得到深入研究。因此, 我们分析了从1990年到2019年204个国家和地区卒中及其亚型的HFPG归因负担。 方法: 
从2019年全球疾病负担研究中获得可归因于HFPG的中风负担的详细数据。按年龄、性别和地区估计1990年至2019年期间中风残疾调整寿命年(DALY)、死亡数、残疾生存年数和寿命损失年的数量和年龄标化率。 
结果: 2019年HFPG归因性卒中的DALY年龄标化率(ASDR)为354.95/10万, 其中缺血性卒中占49.0%, 脑出血占44.3%, 
蛛网膜下腔出血占6.6%。在过去的30年里, 社会人口统计指数(SDI)较低地区HFPG归因性卒中的ASDR超过了SDI较高地区。一般来说, 
50岁以上的人群占HFPG导致的卒中DALY的92%, 男性在一生中比女性更容易患HFPG所致的中风。 结论: 
针对HFPG的关键人群预防计划可能会减轻中风疾病的负担。鉴于世界范围内卒中负担可归因于HFPG的人口比例飙升, 每个国家都应评估其疾病负担, 
并确定有针对性的预防和控制战略。.

BACKGROUND: Whether there was clinical superiority for the single-radius 
prosthesis over the multi-radius prothesis in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
still remains to be clarified. We updated a meta-analysis including prospective 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the clinical prognosis of 
patients receiving single-radius TKA (SR-TKA) or multi-radius TKA (MR-TKA).
METHODS: We searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Library, MEDLINE for eligible RCTs. Two reviewers evaluated the study quality 
according to the Risk of Bias tool of the Cochrane Library and extracted the 
data in studies individually. The extracted data included the baseline data and 
clinical outcome. The baseline data include the author's name, country, and year 
of included studies, the name of knee prosthesis used in studies, sample size, 
follow-up time, and BMI of patients. The clinical data comprised primary 
indicators including postoperative knee range of motion (ROM), sit-to-stand 
rest, severe postoperative scorings, such as visual analog scale (VAS), American 
Knee Society knee score (AKS), Oxford knee scoring (OKS), and SF-36 Quality of 
Life Scale, as well as various secondary indicators of complications including 
anterior knee pain, postoperative infection, aseptic prosthesis loosening, and 
prosthesis revision. The data analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 
software and STATA 12.0. The sensitivity analysis was performed using STATA 
12.0.
RESULTS: A total of 13 RCTs, along with 1720 patients and 1726 knees, were 
finally included in our present meta-analysis. We found that patients in SR-TKA 
group performed better in the sit-to-stand test (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.41, 
p = 0.03) and satisfaction evaluation (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.42-7.53, p = 0.005), 
which were only evaluated in two included RCTs. While no significant difference 
was found between SR-TKA and MR-TKA groups in terms of postoperative ROM, VAS 
scoring, AKS scoring, SF-36 scoring, OKS scoring, and various complications 
including anterior knee pain, postoperative infection, aseptic prosthesis 
loosening, and prosthesis revision.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our present meta-analysis indicated that SR implants 
were noninferior to MR implants in TKA, and SR implants could be an alternative 
choice over MR implants, since patients after SR-TKA felt more satisfied and 
performed better in the sit-to-stand test, with no significant difference in 
complications between SR-TKA and MR-TKA groups. While more relevant clinical 
trials with long-term follow-up time and specific tests evaluating the function 
of knee extension mechanism should be carried out to further investigate the 
clinical performance of SR implants.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hyperkalaemia can be a life-threatening condition, 
particularly in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease with and without 
heart failure. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy offers 
cardiorenal protection in chronic kidney disease and heart failure; however, it 
may also cause hyperkalaemia subsequently resulting in down-titration or 
discontinuation of treatment. Hence, there is an unmet need for hyperkalaemia 
treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without heart failure 
to enable renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use in this patient 
population. In this study, we develop a de novo disease progression and 
cost-effectiveness model to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes 
associated with the use of patiromer for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in 
patients with chronic kidney disease with and without heart failure.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using data from the OPAL-HK trial to 
assess the health economic impact of patiromer therapy in comparison to standard 
of care in controlling hyperkalaemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney 
disease with and without heart failure in the Irish setting. The model was 
designed to predict the natural history of chronic kidney disease and heart 
failure and quantify the costs and benefits associated with the use of patiromer 
for hyperkalaemia management over a lifetime horizon from a payer perspective.
RESULTS: Treatment with patiromer was associated with an increase in discounted 
life-years (8.62 vs 8.37) and an increase in discounted quality-adjusted 
life-years (6.15 vs 5.95). Incremental discounted costs were predicted at €4979 
per patient, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €25,719 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. Patients remained taking patiromer treatment 
for an average of 7.7 months, with treatment associated with reductions in the 
overall clinical event incidence and a delay in chronic kidney disease 
progression. Furthermore, patiromer was associated with lower overall rates of 
hospitalisation, major adverse cardiovascular events, dialysis, 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor discontinuation episodes and 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor down-titration episodes. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in 
Ireland, treatment with patiromer was estimated to have a 100% chance of cost 
effectiveness compared with standard of care.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated an economic case for the reimbursement 
of patiromer for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with chronic kidney 
disease with and without heart failure in Ireland. Patiromer was estimated to 
improve life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy, whilst incurring 
marginal additional costs when compared with current standard of care. Results 
are predominantly attributed to the ability of patiromer to enable the 
continuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor treatment whilst 
also reducing potassium levels.

When healthcare interventions prolong life, people consume medical and 
non-medical goods during the years of life they gain. It has been argued that 
the costs for medical consumption should be included in cost-effectiveness 
analyses from both a healthcare and societal perspective, and the costs for 
non-medical consumption should additionally be included when a societal 
perspective is applied. Standardized estimates of these so-called future costs 
are available in only a few countries and the impact of inclusion of these costs 
is likely to differ between countries. In this paper we present and compare 
future costs for five European countries and estimate the impact of including 
these costs on the cost-effectiveness of life-prolonging interventions. As 
countries differ in the availability of data, we illustrate how both individual- 
and aggregate-level data sources can be used to construct standardized estimates 
of future costs. Results show a large variation in costs between countries. The 
medical costs for the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom are large 
compared to Spain and Greece. Non-medical costs are higher in Germany, Spain, 
and the United Kingdom than in Greece. The impact of including future costs on 
the ICER similarly varied between countries, ranging from €1000 to €35,000 per 
QALY gained. The variation between countries in impact on the ICER is largest 
when considering medical costs and indicate differences in both structure and 
level of healthcare financing in these countries. Case study analyses were 
performed in which we highlight the large impact of including future costs on 
ICER relative to willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Home Telemonitoring and a Diagnostic Algorithm in the Management of Heart 
Failure in the Netherlands: Cost-effectiveness Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major health concern associated with significant 
morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life in patients. Home 
telemonitoring (HTM) facilitates frequent or continuous assessment of disease 
signs and symptoms, and it has shown to improve compliance by involving patients 
in their own care and prevent emergency admissions by facilitating early 
detection of clinically significant changes. Diagnostic algorithms (DAs) are 
predictive mathematical relationships that make use of a wide range of collected 
data for calculating the likelihood of a particular event and use this output 
for prioritizing patients with regard to their treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of HTM and a DA in 
the management of heart failure in the Netherlands. Three interventions were 
analyzed: usual care, HTM, and HTM plus a DA.
METHODS: A previously published discrete event simulation model was used. The 
base-case analysis was performed according to the Dutch guidelines for economic 
evaluation. Sensitivity, scenario, and value of information analyses were 
performed. Particular attention was given to the cost-effectiveness of the DA at 
various levels of diagnostic accuracy of event prediction and to different 
patient subgroups.
RESULTS: HTM plus the DA extendedly dominates HTM alone, and it has a 
deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with usual care of 
€27,712 (currency conversion rate in purchasing power parity at the time of 
study: €1=US $1.29; further conversions are not applicable in cost-effectiveness 
terms) per quality-adjusted life year. The model showed robustness in the 
sensitivity and scenario analyses. HTM plus the DA had a 96.0% probability of 
being cost-effective at the appropriate €80,000 per quality-adjusted life year 
threshold. An optimal point for the threshold value for the alarm of the DA in 
terms of its cost-effectiveness was estimated. New York Heart Association class 
IV patients were the subgroup with the worst cost-effectiveness results versus 
usual care, while HTM plus the DA was found to be the most cost-effective for 
patients aged <65 years and for patients in New York Heart Association class I.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the increased costs of adopting HTM plus the DA in the 
management of heart failure may seemingly be an additional strain on scarce 
health care resources, the results of this study demonstrate that, by increasing 
patient life expectancy by 1.28 years and reducing their hospitalization rate by 
23% when compared with usual care, the use of this technology may be seen as an 
investment, as HTM plus the DA in its current form extendedly dominates HTM 
alone and is cost-effective compared with usual care at normally accepted 
thresholds in the Netherlands.

Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disorder that causes 
accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body fluids and tissues, leading to 
progressive organ damage and reduced life expectancy. It can affect both males 
and females and can be classified into classic or later-onset phenotypes. In 
classic Fabry disease, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity is absent or 
severely reduced and disease manifestations have an early onset that can affect 
multiple organs. In contrast, in later-onset Fabry disease, patients have 
residual α-Gal A activity and clinical features are primarily confined to the 
heart. Individualized therapeutic goals in Fabry disease are required due to 
varying phenotypes and patient characteristics, and the wide spectrum of disease 
severity. An international group of expert physicians convened to discuss and 
develop practical clinical recommendations for disease- and organ-specific 
therapeutic goals in Fabry disease, based on expert consensus and evidence 
identified through a structured literature review. Biomarkers reflecting 
involvement of various organs in adult patients with classic Fabry disease are 
discussed and consensus recommendations for disease- and organ-specific 
therapeutic goals are provided. These consensus recommendations should support 
the establishment of individualized approaches to the management of patients 
with classic Fabry disease by considering identification, diagnosis, and 
initiation of disease-specific therapies before significant organ involvement, 
as well as routine monitoring, to reduce morbidity, optimize patient care, and 
improve patient health-related quality of life.
